  - Vessel damages Nazrul Setu on way out           A STAFF REPORTER                          A floating crane being brought in to repair the drawbridge. Picture by Amit Datta                                        
	An empty cargo vessel sailing out of Kidderpore dock rammed into Nazrul Setu early on Wednesday, damaging the 44-year-old drawbridge and stalling both river and road traffic until late in the afternoon.        
	Jindal Tarini, owned by the Jindal Group, was halfway through the drawbridge when it veered off course and crashed into the steel-and-concrete guard wall.         
	It was around 3am. My colleagues and I were patrolling the dock when we heard a loud sound. We turned around and saw the vessel touching the left side of the guard wall. A closer inspection revealed serious damage, said Shambhu Ojha, a Calcutta Port Trust guard.        
	Port Trust engineers and other technical staff didnt reach the spot until six hours later to repair the damaged drawbridge. Traffic resumed at 4.30pm, more than 13 hours after the accident.        
	The concrete portion of the wall had collapsed and the iron fencing  five feet wide and around three feet tall  was reduced to a mangled mass of metal, said B.K. Sau, the chief public relations officer of Calcutta Port Trust.        
	The hydraulic drawbridge was split wide open, with the two slabs pointing skywards, until 9am. Our engineers and other technical staff needed to first determine the extent of the damage before trying out ways to lower the two slabs, Sau said, explaining the delay.        
	Mahabahu, the floating crane, arrived around noon and helped bring the suspended slabs down.        
	Police officers said traffic on Garden Reach Road would have gone haywire had Nazrul Setu, which connects Metiabruz to south and central Calcutta, been damaged during peak hours. The timing of the accident helped us plan in advance and divert traffic from Diamond Harbour Road and Swing Bridge, said a sergeant deployed on Garden Reach Road.         
	Commuters who cross Nazrul Setu every day blame snags in the hydraulic system for regular traffic interruptions. After a vessel passes by, the two slabs of the drawbridge sometimes seem to take ages to come down. I have faced delays of up to two hours, said Mohammed Ehtasham, a Metiabruz resident who works in New Market.        
	There are days when the drawbridge has to be opened as many as four times for vessels to pass by, leading to as many interruptions in road traffic.

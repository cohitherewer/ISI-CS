                                                                                                               Hooch toll rises

	Another resident of Mahestala died late on Tuesday allegedly after consuming illicit liquor, taking the death toll in the area to six in two days.        
	Sambhu Nath Shaw, 50, was admitted to SSKM Hospital with severe abdominal pain and died around 10pm on Tuesday.         
	His landlady said he used to drink spurious liquor. Police are, however, yet to confirm the death.        
	Since Sunday, six persons have died in Mahestala allegedly after consuming hooch. The administration has confirmed only two deaths and cited various diseases as the cause.        
	State finance and excise minister Asim Dasgupta on Tuesday announced a reduction in the price of country liquor. This will reduce the price difference between country liquor and hooch and persuade people to opt for the licensed product.        
	He said Rs 100 crore would be earmarked for the rehabilitation of over 1 lakh people involved in the hooch trade.

	They were the koihais, the stayers-on, the expats. Even 60 years after the Brits returned home, they chose to stay on in the country they once ruled.         
	In 1964, Hugh Purcell chose to embark on a 70-hour train journey from Amsterdam to Istanbul, after graduating in history from Cambridge University. And from Erzserum on the Turkish-Iranian border, he boarded a local bus to Zaiden from where there was a train once a week to Quetta.         
	It was July, hot and humid. From Quetta I travelled to Lahore and then to Amritsar. Finally I had arrived in the land of wild peacocks and heavy monsoons, said Purcell, who was in town recently.        
	But unlike the expats, his subjects of study, Purcell went back to work as a film-maker in the West before coming back again at a later stage in his life to chronicle the lives of the very last dozen Brits still living in India. And so he penned After the Raj: The Last Stayers-On and the Legacy of British India, which is based on his interviews with expats.         
	I wanted to catch them before they died. In fact, many of them died while writing the book, said Purcell.         
	In the 1960s, there were 14,000 resident Brits in India of whom 2,000-3,000 were living in Calcutta. They were tea planters and their families, the boxwallahs or the managing agencies who ran tea plantations, coal mines, jute and paper mills. In the 1970s, when the Centre decided to nationalise banks, tax the Brits and their enterprises heavily, their numbers halved, said Purcell.

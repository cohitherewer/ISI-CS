                                                                                                               Fraud funds bought stocks
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Anirban Ghosh. (Sanat Kr Sinha)                                   
	A substantial part of the Rs 6 crore that dud firm directors Anirban Ghosh and his wife Debarchna allegedly defrauded their employees of was invested in stocks.        
	The two had taken Rs 50,000 as security deposit from over 1,000 persons by promising them jobs in Infogen Global. They and the other two directors had invested in the share market expecting fat dividends, said a senior CID officer investigating the case.        
	Incriminating documents have been seized from the company directors. Police are currently scanning the transaction list of their bank accounts.        
	Anirban, the managing director, was arrested in Alipore and his associates Soumitra Bose, Abin Bhattacharya and Prasenjit Roy in Salt Lake on Saturday evening. Debarchna was arrested on March 26.        
	The couple lived lavishly and had plans to settle abroad. We found immigration papers in their house, said an officer. During interrogation, CID officers learnt that Anirban and his wife had used 18 cellphone sets and 24 SIM cards while operating from their five offices in Sector V.        
	We have seized all the cellphones and SIM cards used by them. They changed their SIM cards several times since the racket was busted, added the officer.        
	The couples Hyundai Accent and Toyota Qualis were also impounded.        
	All the arrested have been charged with conspiracy, criminal breach of trust, cheating and forgery. They will be produced before the ACJM court on April 9.        
	Investigators suspect the involvement of four other people in the racket.

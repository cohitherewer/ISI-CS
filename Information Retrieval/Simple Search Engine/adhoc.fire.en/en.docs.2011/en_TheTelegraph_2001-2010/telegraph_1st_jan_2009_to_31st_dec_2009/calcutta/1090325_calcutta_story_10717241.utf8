           Constant vigil: I fully agree with Subhankar Mukherjees letter Security upgrade needs change in work culture, published on February 4, that only installing CCTVs on Howrah bridge will not ensure its safety, the security set up has to be monitored continuously. I would like to add that it is also necessary to watch the underbelly of the bridge as it offers ample scope to criminals. Sabotage is possible from vessels sailing under the bridge and, therefore, continuous vigilance of the underbelly of the bridge is also the need of the hour.                                     
	It was not the fear of contempt of court proceedings against the state government that liberated Hotel Hindusthan International (HHI) from the clutches of Citu protesters but a sustained campaign by Metro (Cop flurry in contempt fear, February 5).           
	This was possibly the first time that the state government acted promptly, freeing the hotel of banners and flags, which had reduced HHI to a turf for political muscle-flexing.           
	Did the Citu leaders consider the fate of the hotels employees if HHI had closed shop because of the squatters?           
	These leaders are perhaps not aware of the global economic meltdown. Given the crisis in the job market, the Citu should limit its trade union activities so that industries can survive, which is in the interest of the workers too.           
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is trying to make West Bengal an investment-friendly destination but his partys labour arm is hell-bent on turning the state into a graveyard for industries. Hostile trade unionism sends a wrong message to prospective investors. By hoisting flags and mounting posters in state offices CPM leaders demarcate their political turf, which is most unbecoming.           
	The administration should formulate clear guidelines barring all government institutions from hoisting political flags and protest banners.

	The way graduation and post-graduation papers are being checked, re-examination has become compulsory. The court orders for mandatory showing of answer scripts will rescue the future of thousands of students (Student right to scan script, February 6). Compared to other universities, Calcutta University loves to create hurdles for students careers. The West Bengal board of examination also hinders proper correction of papers. Perhaps both want to strengthen students for greater battles! Although the court has passed an order, it needs to come into effect very soon and the students should get the benefit, only then would the court order be of any significance.

	It is good to learn that students dissatisfied with their marks have to be shown the answer scripts under the Right to Information Act. The verdict of Calcutta High Court is historic and far-reaching given that numerous students appearing in different examinations, especially Madhyamik, are dissatisfied with the evaluation of their answer scripts. The ruling will also make the examination agencies more responsible.

	Thanks to a section of the media and the entertainment industry, youth and children are now exposed to the worst of western culture (Song and dance, February 1). The most unfortunate part of this sordid affair is that even parents of middle-class families in Bengal are taking a serious interest in these so-called talent hunts and are urging their kids to take part in the programmes for overnight fame and money. The children are programmed towards cheap fame and money. The participants emulate postures of western pop artists, which in many cases do not suit Indian style of melodies. Dance no more means the presentation of an idea through rhythmic body and facial expressions but odd and vulgar thrusts expressing extreme excitement. Children behave and crack jokes like adults on stage. And these are highly appreciated by todays degenerated pseudo-cultured middle class. These contestants are surely getting fame and money but at the cost of values that have been cherished in our society for ages.

	This is with reference to the series of articles titled Rajarhat in ruins. As a flat-owner in New Town, I sincerely thank Metro for the insightful articles on the ground realities in the township. The nincompoops in Hidco, which is the developing authority, can only offer lame excuses for not doing the work they are paid to do.             
	The first few batches of residents of any new township have the right to expect at least basic civic amenities. But no meaningful work has been done in New Town so far to make it livable. I would like Metro to ask the chief minister on my behalf about how he feels now that his dream township has turned out to be a nightmare.           
	Azeem Nawaaz,

	The report Murder tales, with humour, January 30, made for pleasurable reading. Scottish author Alexander McCall Smith lavished accolades on a host of Indian writers at the Ashoke Kumar Sarkar Memorial Lecture at the Book Fair and paid a special tribute to R.K. Narayan. McCall Smith said he admired the creator of Malgudi Days because of his wry sense of humour and because he wrote about the dignity of small persons. We Indians have every reason to feel elated at such recognition of our very own author, whose stories are now included in the English syllabi of secondary, higher secondary and even undergraduate courses across the country.             
	P.B. Saha,

	For over four decades we have witnessed a systematic environmental degradation of the city, be it illegal felling of trees, air pollution, government-sponsored destruction of water bodies to give way to housing or industrial projects, indiscriminate use of polythene bags, etc. I was pleasantly surprised to read that La Martiniere for Girls has undertaken to improve the environment in and around the school by making the area a no horn zone and banning the use of plastic bags. The students will also clean the Maidan and free walls of posters (Plastic ban in school, February 9). It would be ideal if all the schools in the city join hands and undertake a coordinated drive to improve the citys environment, making Calcutta a better place to live in.             
	A.S. Mehta,
  New Alipore           
	Guidance from school teachers plays a vital role in the development of students. It is heartening that students are on a mission to ban plastic on campus.           
	B.N. Bose, 
  Dum Dum Park             
	The news Woman in wheelchair hit by cop, January 30, was shocking. It is an irony that the rogue cop was manning the residence of the noble and compassionate Gopalkrishna Gandhi. The authorities should not only ensure that the culprit is punished for manhandling an elderly man and his mentally and physically challenged daughter, but also ask its security personnel to take a lesson in civility from the governor.             
	Kajal Chatterjee,
  Sodepur           
	Two news reports saddened me greatly. A physically challenged girl was thrown out of her wheelchair at Raj Bhavan by a sergeant for wanting to meet the governor. And an innocent seven-year-old, Yash Lakhotia, was kidnapped and murdered in Howrah. The Raj Bhavan cop was suspended and Yashs killers may be sent to jail, but such incidents expose the inhuman and brutal side of our society.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 2 deaths on day of distress
                                                                                                               2 deaths on day of distress
  - City wilts under heat   spell and power cuts        OUR BUREAU                                                        
	Two deaths, possibly caused by the heat, turned the citys week of torment into tragedy on Thursday even as the mercury crossed the 40-degree mark for the fourth time in six days and rotational power cuts continued.        
	The victims  a 55-year-old auto driver in Howrah and a 50-year-old tea-seller in Sodepur  according to doctors, had shown signs of death caused by sun stroke on a day when the maximum temperature was 40.1 degrees Celsius, and the discomfort index was 66 degrees Celsius.        
	Mohammad Mukhtar, a resident of Rajen Seth Lane near the Liluah Don Bosco school, was taken ill around 10.30am after making three trips to and from Howrah station in the sweltering heat. The auto route is popular among teachers and students of Don Bosco.        
	Mukhtar was rushed by other auto drivers to TL Jaiswal Hospital, where he died before treatment could begin. Sushabhon Adhakari, a doctor on duty, said: He could have died after suffering a sun stroke. The body has been sent for post-mortem to know the exact cause of death.        
	A few hours later, Kali Das, a tea-seller at Sodepur railway station, collapsed on the platform. The junior divisional medical officer of Naihati, S. Mishra, declared Das dead.        
	The note sent to us by a medical officer mentioned that the resident of Agarpara had died of cardiac failure caused by excessive heat. We sent the body for post-mortem to RG Kar Medical College, said S.S. Chakrabarty, the acting superintendent of railway police in the Sealdah division.         
	Sources in RG Kar said Das appeared to have suffered a heat stroke, but a final report would be submitted on Friday.        
	Thursday was bad, with the maximum and minimum temperatures four degrees above normal, the discomfort index 11 degrees above normal, and no trace of rain.        
	Calcutta experienced yet another sultry day with loo in the afternoon. The hot, dry northwesterlys, blowing in over south Bengal from north and central India are to blame, said a senior official of the Alipore Met office.        
	The heat wave-like conditions would persist for at least another 24 hours in south Bengal, he added, warning of hot, dry winds in the afternoon.        
	There was no improvement in the power situation either, with the combined shortfall in CESC and WBSEB-served areas shooting up to 635MW during the evening peak hours, causing power cuts of two hours and more in several areas. The shortfall in the CESC-supplied areas rose to 185MW while the deficit was 435MW in the districts.        
	The combined demand in the CESC and WBSEDCL served areas was 5,000MW.        
	The demand is high and we now need a Norwester to bring it down, said power secretary Sunil Mitra.        
	While the weatherman held out no hope for a Norwester, the power man said the power situation should improve marginally from Friday.        
	Mitra met chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti at Writers Buildings on Thursday and briefed him on the situation.        
	Generation levels have dropped because of technical snags in some power plants while demand has soared. That is leading to a demand-supply mismatch. But we hope to achieve higher generation from Friday, he said.        
	The power secretary also blamed reduced availability of coal but added that he had requested Eastern Coalfields to increase supply. We will also buy coal from Indonesia if necessary to tide over this crisis, revealed Mitra.

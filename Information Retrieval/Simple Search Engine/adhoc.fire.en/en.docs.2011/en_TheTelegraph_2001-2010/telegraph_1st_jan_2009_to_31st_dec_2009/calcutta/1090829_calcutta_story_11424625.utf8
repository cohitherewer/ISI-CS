The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Buddha prod to speed up probe
                                                                                                               Buddha prod to speed up probe
          OUR BUREAU                              
	The political controversy over forceful land acquisition and the lack of sting in the investigation of the arson at Vedic Village have prompted the government to shift gears.        
	At present, the police are investigating the case but the case can be handed over to the CID, chief secretary Ashok Mohan Chakrabarti said at Writers Buildings on Friday.        
	The chief secretary and the director-general of police, Bhupinder Singh, briefed the chief minister on Friday about the progress  or the lack of it  in the Vedic Village case.        
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee apparently told Chakrabarti and Singh to speed up investigations.        
	A senior police officer told Metro that the probe team was struggling to make much headway as Gaffar Mollah was absconding five days after the violence at Vedic Village.        
	The arrests of Biplab Biswas, a Vedic Village employee, and Abdul Hai, alias Kalobabu, an aide of Gaffar, are significant. But the arrest of Gaffar is critical for the case and we are yet to track him down, admitted an officer, adding that he may have fled to somewhere in northern India with help from his Trinamul patrons.        
	Both Biswas and Kalobabu were produced at Barasat court on Friday and were remanded in police custody for five days. The duo have been charged with sections 302 (murder) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code and 25 Arms Act for possessing illegal arms.        
	Biswas and Kalobabu were close to Gaffar and their interrogation will reveal how they went about purchasing land for the project, said the officer.        
	Biswass wife Madhumita was present in the court and said her husband had been falsely implicated in the case.        
	The cops are also interrogating Moinuddin, who was arrested earlier on arson charges, to get details about Gaffars associates in the area.         
	There is no question of protecting anybody. Those who have committed the crime must be arrested, said chief secretary Chakrabarti.         
	But victims of Gaffars strong-arm tactics expressed surprise over the failure of the police in tracing the man who carried three cellphones. Why have they not even raided Gaffars two-storeyed house in Chanpagachhi, wondered a neighbour of the fugitive.        
	According to the police, electronic surveillance hasnt yielded anything as the cellphones are all switched off. Gaffars house will be raided after we seek permission from the court, said an officer.

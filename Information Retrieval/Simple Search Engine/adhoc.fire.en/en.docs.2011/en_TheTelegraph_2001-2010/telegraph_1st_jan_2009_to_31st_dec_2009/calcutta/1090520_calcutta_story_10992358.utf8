The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Parents paralyse traffic to protest fee hike
                                                                                                               Parents paralyse traffic to protest fee hike
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Parents laid siege to the streets in front of another city school on Tuesday in protest against a fee hike that they said was unreasonably high.        
	More than 350 parents of students of Scottish Church Collegiate School staged a roadblock in front of the school on Bidhan Sarani demanding that the authorities roll back the hike.         
	The authorities have not only increased the tuition fee but also almost doubled the development fee. The authorities must explain the rationale behind this steep hike, said Debabrata Mukherjee, the father of a Class VI student.         
	The roadblock disrupted the flow of traffic on Bidhan Sarani, Vivekananda Road, College Street and Amherst Street from 11am till 1.45pm. The parents dispersed only after senior police officers promised to broker a meeting with the school authorities, the date for which is to be announced next Tuesday.         
	The trigger for the protest was a notice put up on Monday, announcing the managements decision to hike fees from the current academic session. The school increased the fee for the English-medium wing by around Rs 350 a month and more than Rs 250 for the Bengali-medium wing.        
	Representatives of parents and guardians had had a meeting with the schools managing committee on May 11 but it apparently ended in a stalemate.         
	A second meeting was convened on May 15 but the school authorities invited only those who they thought wouldnt oppose the decision too much, complained Samar Chatterjee, another aggrieved parent.        
	Schools have been raising fees primarily to pay salaries to teachers and other staff in accordance with the recommendations of the Fifth Pay Commission.         
	Parents claimed that infrastructure at the school was inadequate and that students were deprived of even basic amenities like clean toilets.        
	The headmasters post has been vacant for the past eight years. The fans in the classrooms do not work even in summer. If students were to be present in full strength, the classrooms would be too small to accommodate all of them, said a guardian.         
	Himadri Shekhar Roy, a member of the managing committee, said: If the Fifth Pay Commissions recommendations are to be implemented, we have no choice but to increase fees. We do not have any other source of revenue. In any case, we hadnt raised fees in the past two years.

                      Forgotten melodies                    Between 1945 and 1951 Salil Chowdhury composed some of his most momentous, important political songs. They were significant both with regard to their political impact as well as in their textual, tonal and structural novelty, which proclaimed the then young composers uniqueness. It is estimated that he composed over 50 such songs, only a few of which were recorded and released. The rest were, unfortunately, forgotten or were lost. After his demise, many of these songs were rediscovered with the help of some of the original members of Indian Peoples Theatre Association (IPTA) who were closely connected to the departed music composer. After several years of research and hard work, the lyrics and the melodies of these songs were firmly established and authenticated. A selection of 12 songs from this period has been recorded by IPTA singers and others. Their musical arrangement was done with great care, keeping in mind Chowdhurys distinctive style. Songs of Consciousness, this evenings programme, features the presentation of these numbers along with commentary and discussion. Participants: Dr Samir Gupta, Tathagata Bhattacharya, Sumangala Damodaran and others. The recital will be preceded by an introduction by Gautam Choudhury and a welcome address by Karunasindhu Das, vice-chancellor of Rabindra Bharati University.                    lEvent: A programme of Salil Chowdhurys unpublished mass songs lWhen: Today at 6 pm lWhere: Spandan, 87 Park Street

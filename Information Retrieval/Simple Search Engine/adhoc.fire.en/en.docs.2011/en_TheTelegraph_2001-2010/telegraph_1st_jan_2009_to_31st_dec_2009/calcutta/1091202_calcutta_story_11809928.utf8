The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Second alert led to girl identity 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Second alert led to girl identity 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Rishensi Neha Horos parents came to know about their missing daughters death only because Belur GRP sent a second alert to Lalbazar on November 17 about an unidentified body, a probe has revealed.         
	The body had been cremated by then. The GRP sent the second alert as is the standard procedure before closing a case, said a Calcutta police officer.        
	The first alert had come at 10.27am on August 2, around four hours after the body was found beside the railway tracks between Uttarpara and Bally. The GRP cremated the body on August 12 as no law enforcement agency contacted it about the body, the officer said.        
	Both alerts were sent to Lalbazar and all police stations in the state. The GRP had estimated the age of 15-year-old Rishensi as 20.         
	Even after getting the second alert, it took the missing squad nine days to inform the Horos, said the officer.         
	Nine days after the second alert Bokul Mitra, the additional officer-in-charge of the missing squad, asked the family to visit Belur GRP.         
	The girls mother went to Belur on November 28 with her husband and identified Rishensis jeans, T-shirt and slippers, said the officer.        
	Rishensi, a student of St Pauls Boarding Day School, had not returned after leaving her Taratala home since July 31. The police commissioner held an emergency meeting with the missing squad and ordered an internal inquiry into the incident, said an officer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Star hotel gears up for Gariahat
                                                                                                               Star hotel gears up for Gariahat
          SUBHRO SAHA                          An artists impression of the proposed hotel in Garcha First Lane                                  
	A 100-room hotel in the heart of south Calcutta, classifying itself as five-star boutique, is gearing up to be guest-ready by end-2010.        
	The Rs 265-crore hospitality address coming up on a 50-cottah land parcel next to the Gariahat Pantaloons outlet at 17 Garcha First Lane, is being developed by Mukti Projects Ltd, makers of the Mukti World shopping and multiplex centre nearby.        
	We want to deliver a cosy, internationally benchmarked hotel that has been concept-designed in Singapore and detailed by city-based architect-cum-interiors specialist Vinoo Chadha, Raj Kumar Gupta, the chairman and managing director of the Mukti group, told Metro.        
	The design is very contemporary and minimalist. We have created a sense of depth and volume in the lobby. Therell be a novel infinity pool on the landscaped terrace, besides a club lounge and spa, said Chadha.        
	Coming close on the heels of two hotels  Ambuja Realtys Swisstel and the Shristi-Westin property  being announced in Rajarhat, the citys realty fraternity is eyeing the Ballygunge hotel as a welcome energiser.        
	This would be the first organised luxury hotel in the heart of south Calcutta and would complement the upcoming Taj Gateway Hotel on the Ruby connector and together, would expand the hospitality/F amp;B market in that catchment, feels Abhijit Das of property consultants Lemongrass Advisors Pvt Ltd.        
	Industry watchers are also bullish about the 100-key ITC Fortune hotel, being constructed by renovating Rutt Din on Loudon Street, and the Swabhumi hospitality project of Ambuja Realty.        
	A clutch of five-star hotel projects, which were announced with much fanfare along the Bypass corridor and in Rajarhat, have failed to take off, putting paid to projections of 2,000 keys being added to the citys star hotel ring within five years.        
	Against the projected growth of 20-30 per cent two years ago, occupancy slumped around 20 per cent.        
	Even if the 4,000 proposed rooms across all segments are added to the citys organised hospitality inventory of 2,200-odd, the sum total would still be only half that of Bangalores present capacity and a mere five per cent of Bangkoks.        
	The Mukti groups ambitious F amp;B journey is set to begin next week, with the unveiling of a novel lounge bar and restaurant in the Mukti World mall.        
	We are creating a new niche with an exclusive lounge (Bluzz) that would resemble the ice-vodka bars of Europe in decor, service and ambience, and Gold Brick, a multi-cuisine restaurant, said Siddharth Maitra, the chief executive, retail amp; hospitality, of Mukti Projects Ltd.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Molest cop in cuffs after a year
                                                                                                               Molest cop in cuffs after a year
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A sub-inspector of Uluberia police station, who had been ignoring court summons in a molestation case against him, was sent to three days judicial custody on Tuesday.        
	Soumen Choudhury, the accused officer, appeared before the additional chief judicial magistrate following the expiry of a stay on an arrest warrant against him.        
	The sub-inspector visited the house of Yad Ali at Moubesia village under Howrahs Uluberia police station on May 28, 2008, to investigate a complaint of torture lodged by his daughter-in-law Julekha Bibi.        
	Ali later lodged a police complaint alleging that Choudhury took Halima Begum, another of his three daughters-in-law, to a room where he molested her.        
	The woman took ill and had to be admitted to a hospital, where she was under psychiatric treatment for three months, the complaint stated.        
	Ali had alleged that he had approached the superintendent of police and other senior officers but no action was taken against Chowdhury, prompting him to file a suit in Uluberia court on August 16, 2008.        
	Choudhury appeared before the additional chief judicial magistrate a few days later and was granted bail. But he had never appeared in the court after that, ignoring several summons.        
	On July 4, 2009, the magistrate asked the police to issue an arrest warrant against the accused. The cop then moved the high court and got a stay for eight weeks on the magistrates order. The period of the stay ended on September 4.        
	Chowdhury appeared before the magistrate on Tuesday and prayed for bail. But the court rejected the plea and remanded him in judicial custody for three days.        
	I am happy the man is finally behind bars, Ali said.

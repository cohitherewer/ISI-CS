                                                                                                               Idols found under water
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Some of the idols found in the Hooghly. (Gopal Senapati)                                  
	Bathers in the Hooghly, near Sankrail police station, found nine idols made of brass and other materials under water on Friday morning.        
	The Archaeological Survey of India has been asked to estimate the value of the idols.         
	Police said the idols had probably been dumped near the river by thieves and had been swept away during high tide.         
	Santu Bera, a 32-year-old resident of the area, said: We were taking our daily dip in the river when I felt a metallic object touch my leg. I went under the water and found a statuette. The other bathers too went under the water and found idols.        
	The bathers handed over the idols to the police. Two Nadugopal idols (brass), a Radha-Krishna idol (brass), two Kali idols (brass), two Shivlings (black metal), an image of Sai Baba (white stone) and a trident (brass) were found.

Rishop
                                                
	Rishop (Ri stands for mountain peak and shop means age-old trees in Tibetan) is an ideal destination if you are looking for a peaceful getaway. Situated at a height of 8,500ft, Rishop, in North Bengal, is best known for its panoramic view of not only Mt Kanchenjunga but also Mt Kabru, Kokthang, Pandim and the Nathu La Pass.        
	Rishop can be reached via Lava. There is a picturesque trekking route for the adventurous. For the others, a bumpy car ride from Lava will take around half an hour. We boarded the Kanchan Kanya Express from Calcutta and reached New Jalpaiguri station. From there we hired a car that took us to Lava, through Gorubathan amid lush tea gardens. We spent two days in Lava visiting the Kagyu Thekchen monastery, the serene Changay falls and also Lolegaon, a picturesque little village. Next we headed for Rishop.        
	The road to Rishop is extremely bumpy as it is strewn with rocks and boulders. But the sheer beauty of the picture postcard village is worth every aching muscle in your body. We were lucky to get a view of the majestic Kanchenjunga from our hotel lobby. The sound of multitudes of birds  some known some exotic  was music to our ears. The villagers have transformed the hill slopes through terrace farming, growing potato, maize, cabbage and other crops. Seeing their simple lives from so close was a unique experience.         
	Rishop is pure bliss for tired eyes and the soul. Tiffindara, a view point, offers a panoramic view of the Himalayan range. We stood there gazing at the sun-kissed slopes, drinking in the serenity and beauty of the place. Sunset turned the snow-capped pinnacles to molten gold, a view impossible to capture in words. A trek through Neora Valley National Park can be a thrilling experience.        
	At night Rishop offers a clear view of lights twinkling like stars all over the hills. Lights of Pedong and Gangtok can be seen on a clear night.         
	Going         
	Take any NJP-bound train from Howrah or Sealdah station.Trekkers and hired cars are available from the syndicate for Lava. It takes three and a half hours to reach Lava. Rates are Rs 1,600 to Rs 1,800. From Lava to Rishop, trekkers will take around Rs 450.

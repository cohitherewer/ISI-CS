                      Tribute through the lens                    His enduring love affair with the lens began at an early age when Aniruddha Pals father introduced him to the magical world of light and shadow. As he grew older, photography became an obsession with Pal, and he decided to devote his life and soul to this art. He began his career as a professional photographer having honed his skills at Bangiya Bijnan Parishad, a renowned photographic organisation, and was soon recognised for his talents. Over the years, he gained 580 acceptances and 130 awards from various national and international salons where his works were exhibited in more than 33 countries around the world. Homage, his ongoing second solo photographic exhibition, is being held in tribute to his father and a few others who helped and encouraged him during his formative years. It features photographs of human life with special reference to rural and tribal communities, including several award-winning photographs. His works also portray seascapes, landscapes and other faces of nature, besides capturing the human character in its candid moments. Poignant, sensitive and introspective, they reflect the beauty and grace, conflict and contradiction, joy and pathos of daily life in uncommon style.

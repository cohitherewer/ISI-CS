  - Xaviers batch moves court        OUR BUREAU                        Calcutta University				             St Xavier rsquo;s College                                                  
	Calcutta Universitys policy on admitting students from autonomous colleges has come under the high court scanner following a case filed by some graduates from St Xaviers College.        
	Twelve students from the Park Street College, the first CU affiliate to be granted autonomy, alleged in their petition that the university had discriminated against them while fixing the criteria for admission to postgraduate courses.        
	The matter came up for hearing before Justice Dipankar Dutta, who directed the petitioners to serve notice on the university.        
	Sambuddha Chakraborty, who appeared for the university, said Justice Dutta had also asked the authorities to state their stand on the petitioners claim by August 20.        
	The petitioners  who failed to get a berth in CUs postgraduate courses in physics, chemistry, mathematics and computer science  alleged that students from affiliated colleges with scores lower than theirs were admitted to these courses because of the discriminatory selection criteria.        
	We should be treated on a par with students from other colleges because the degrees awarded to us bear the seal of the university, said a student of St Xaviers College.        
	Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee, the pro vice-chancellor (academic) of CU, denied that St Xaviers students were being discriminated against since the college became autonomous.        
	One should understand that St Xaviers follows the semester system (in which tests are held twice a year) while the university conducts exams annually. We have to establish a parity and normalise the marks before selecting students for postgraduate courses, said Chatterjee.        
	Normalisation is a statistical tool through which the authorities tried to achieve parity between the results of St Xaviers students and those from the affiliated colleges.        
	A university official admitted that some high scorers from St Xaviers failed to get a berth in the postgraduate courses because of the normalisation.        
	As the row over the admission of St Xaviers students went to the courtroom, there was buzz on the Park Street campus that the college authorities would support the petition. But the colleges stand on the matter could not be independently confirmed.        
	Sources, including a few in the university itself, said the petition had brought under focus the CUs failure to frame an objective admission criteria for students from autonomous colleges.        
	St Xaviers was granted autonomy in 2006 but the university finalised the admission norms for postgraduate courses for students from autonomous colleges only last month.        
	What was the university doing for the past three years? The St Xaviers students would not have taken the trouble of going to court had the university adopted a proper admission policy and disclosed the details well in advance, said a member of the universitys syndicate.        
	Contesting the charge, a university official said: In all our postgraduate courses, 95 per cent of the seats are reserved for graduates from affiliated colleges and the rest for students of other universities. Graduates from St Xaviers are eligible to compete for the seats meant for students from our affiliates.        
	The university admits students in postgraduate courses either on the basis of their scores in the admission test or marks they had secured in the undergraduate exams.        
	If the university is keen on treating all students on a par, they should hold admission tests for all students, including those who are graduating from the affiliated colleges. Thats the best way to solve the problem. Most reputable universities conduct tests for admitting students to postgraduate courses, said a teacher of a leading city college.              
	Post-autonomy heartburn  
	 The dispute: Admission of St Xaviers graduates in CU postgraduate courses   
	 Students demand: Treatment on a par with students graduating from CU affiliated colleges         
	 CU stand: St Xaviers students are not discriminated against. Only their marks are normalised         
	 Status of the case: The court has asked CU to clarify its stand on the issue

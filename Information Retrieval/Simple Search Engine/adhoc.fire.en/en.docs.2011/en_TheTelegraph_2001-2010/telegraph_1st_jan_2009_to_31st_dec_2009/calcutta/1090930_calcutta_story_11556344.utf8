               Feast of happiness: Apropos the report ldquo;Where pandal-hopping is a way of life for five days every year rdquo;, dated September 28, I feel that it is the very idea of togetherness that makes Calcutta hop from pandal to pandal every year (Picture above of popular rendezvous point Maddox Square on Ashtami, by Amit Datta). Dressed in new clothes, it is during this time that Calcutta can take a break and enjoy happy moments together. With relatives and friends turning up, Durga puja gifts a key to happiness to Calcuttans. Innovative concepts and new themes of puja pandals are further attractions that drag us out of our homes. Decorative lighting is an added incentive. Armed with digital cameras and camcorders, people love to capture the best pujas in town and preserve them forever.  Siddhartha Sengupta, Salt Lake                       
	It is amusing to find chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee paying tribute to the high standard of healthcare in his state and admiring the commitment of health service doctors in parts of West Bengal (CM praise for state doctors, June 25). This is such a huge departure from reality that one wonders in which state the chief minister actually lives.             
	Healthcare in West Bengal is one of the worst in the country. Horrific stories of gross medical negligence and abusive treatment in state hospitals fill large sections of newspapers almost daily.           
	The exodus of Bengal patients in south India-bound trains in search of better treatment bears further testimony to the wretched condition of the medical system in Bengal. There is little doubt that failure to make any changes in the abysmal condition of healthcare delivery played a role in the defeat of the CPM in the recent Parliament election.           
	But it seems that the leader of the state administration is still living in denial. Making tall claims without any evidence to back it is not likely to convince people in todays world.           
	Rather than praising a rickety healthcare system and flattering the medical lobby, the chief minister would be well-advised to acknowledge the failure of the CPM government in delivering healthcare during his partys reign of more than three decades.           
	Kunal Saha,

	Undue praise for Kalyani           
	The report City lags in cellphone tower policydated June 16, has showered undue praise on the Kalyani municipality while lambasting the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. The laid down set of norms in this regard as claimed by the chairman of the Kalyani municipality is hardly known to the residents of Kalyani but some cellphone towers set in other open spaces include public parks and play grounds in densely populated areas. Such towers are a perennial source of pollution and an eyesore beside making the parks unfit for sporting action.           
	The Kalyani municipality has been vigorously spreading propaganda since February 2009 through banners, hoardings and its quarterly mouthpiece Kalyani Purokatha claiming that Kalyani is the first clean city of India but the claims were not substantiated even after a written request to the civic authorities from me.           
	The area around the park at the civic centre has become an open-air urinal, which emits a terrible stench. The central park is now a slack yard for storing lamp posts, logs and timber.           
	Facilities and civic amenities are on the decline in the Kalyani municipality area too. It is difficult to understand how Kalyani was declared the first clean city of India, surpassing cities like Chandigarh or towns like Panchkula and Mohali.           
	Jatindra Nath Bhowmik,
  Kalyani                     
	It is good to learn that the CMC has taken an initiative to ban the random installation of cellphone towers atop residential buildings in urban and rural areas. Radiation emitted from cellphone towers causes cancer and genetic defect.           
	Sukumar Ghosh,
  Mukundapur                     
	Water glory           
	The CMC is set to designate 51 ponds as heritage properties (Heritage tag on water bodies, June 25). There are several ponds associated with the cultural history of Calcutta. Between the 1930s and 1950s, sports like water polo and various other water-based activities were organised at the Hedua, College Square and Paddapukur ponds.           
	Lack of maintenance had polluted the water and turned the areas around the ponds into dens for hoodlums. The civic bodys bid to restore the ponds is welcome.           
	Bhupen Bose,
  Dum Dum Park                     
	Helpline for elders           
	A propos the report Basu, Suchitra amp; a helpline, June 29, it is heartening to learn that ex-chief minister Jyoti Basu and actress Suchitra Sen were the first two Calcuttans to sign up for Pranam, a 24-hour helpline for senior citizens.           
	Suchitra Sen (file picture above) has left an indelible mark on the hearts of movie lovers. I was thrilled to see her beautiful signature. At present the handwriting of most students is bad and sometime illegible. Prescriptions written by many physician cannot be read, even by chemists. Given the apathy towards the art of writing, Sens handwriting is worth emulating.           
	Prahlad Agarwala,
  Majdia, Nadia           
	English as career option           
	lIt is encouraging that a lot of students have opted to study English in college (English gets a career boost, June 20). In the last few years, students from English-medium schools have been rushing to pursue management courses that would give them a lucrative career. Parents are to be blamed for depriving students from studying Shakespeare and Wordsworth. The lure of a hefty salary has become the primary concern for the wards as well as their parents.           
	Students must realise that English as a subject has bright prospects too. It should be remembered that only doctors and engineers cannot fulfil all demands of a society. Teachers should play a pivotal role in guiding students to take up English for higher studies.           
	Ratan Kumar Halder,
  Behala                     
	Menu fixation           
	The report Better mishti on menu, June 20, was most amusing. When Lalu Prasad was the railway minister he had introduced rabri on train menus (possibly to please wife Rabri Devi). Now it is Mamata Banerjees turn to play with the rail menu, hence the introduction of chhanar mishti.           
	Though Bengals famous rosogolla has been omitted, fish curry is being included in the Rajdhani Express meals. Given this trend, if the next railway minister is from Kashmir, one would see Kashmiri delicacies like Goshtaba, Rogan Josh and Zafrani Firni being served on trains. However, deciding the rail menu should be left to IRTC. The minister has far more important matters to deal with rather than alter menus.           
	A.S. Mehta,
  New Alipore                     
	As a senior citizen, and a patient of arthritis and heart disease, I was delighted to know that a helpline called Pranam has been launched. I wish Pranam becomes a successful venture with support from police, doctors and the citys youth. Several problems of senior citizens like medical support, loneliness and financial crisis could be sorted out through such an initiative.           
	B.N. Bose,
  Dum Dum Park                     
	Spare the rod           
	It was shocking to learn that Calcutta police did not file cases against two criminals even after they confessed, ostensibly so that their careers were not hampered and on the request of their parents (Cellphone thefts by student gang, June 30).           
	Under what rule did the police let off the criminals? Rape and murder convict Dhananjay Chatterjees parents too had requested that their son be spared the gallows. But Dhananjay was hanged after his guilt was proven. Was it because his parents were poor?           
	One wonders if it is the duty of the city cops to ensure the career growth of students. In the time of downturn, have the police decided to offer students an alternate career in crime? The lenient behaviour smacks of an underhand deal. Such actions on the part of the police will encourage others to take to crime.

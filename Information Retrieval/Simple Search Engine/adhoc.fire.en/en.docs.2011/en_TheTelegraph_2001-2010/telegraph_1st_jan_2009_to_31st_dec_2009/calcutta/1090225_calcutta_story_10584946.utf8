The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Subhass durbar amp; citizens Maidan
                                                                                                               Subhass durbar amp; citizens Maidan
                            
	The Maidan will soon be mine, so its time for me to decide what to do with it  thats what Subhas Chakraborty wanted to say on Tuesday. What the minister did say was: We have made a representation to the defence minister demanding that the Maidan be handed over to the state government. So I want to seek views from various people on what to do with the Maidan.        
	Sports personalities have been invited, he claimed. I may call some environmentalists, including Subhash Dutta, shrugged the man who already seems to be wearing the hat of the next custodian of the Maidan.        
	The Subhas durbar will be convened at Netaji Indoor Stadium on March 4. We dont want the honourable minister to wait till then to know what Calcuttans feel about this matter. So we bring him a small sample from the outraged emails flooding our inbox.              
	I feel strongly that the Maidan belongs to the people of Calcutta and not to any government or party. The government should first make an attempt to save us from the black fumes of buses and autos.        
	Soma Chakraborty         
	As a Calcuttan now working outside I am pained to learn about the recent happenings on the Maidan.        
	Amit Roy, Libya         
	I would like to share my experience while going from Howrah station to Behala in a taxi. As we passed through Brabourne Road and Dalhousie Square, my wife and I felt suffocated by the fumes. But the air became fresh as if by magic when we were crossing the Maidan and racecourse. The difference was huge. The right to live and breathe clean air is much more important than the right to hold rallies.        
	Govind Das Dujari        
	When I was in school in the 1950s, I recollect writing an essay on the Maidan being the lungs of Calcutta and how important it was for the health and wellbeing of the city. Today, the powers that be are hell-bent on destroying it.        
	A. Dutt        
	What is the governments agenda? Protect the autos who belch out toxic fumes to kill the citizens and take control of the Maidan to destroy whatever little source of oxygen is left in the city. Yet, we the people of this state do not protest an issue that results in the death of thousands of people and injects so many with life-threatening ailments. I am also one such citizen of this sorry state.        
	Sunil Agarwal        
	This is yet another attempt by the government to pierce the lungs of Calcuttans. I call upon all sensible people to unite and foil this attempt in order to protect our next generation.        
	Kalyan Mitra         
	The government will make the lungs of Calcutta a playground for politicians.        
	Indradeep Das        
	I am numb as I write this and absolutely livid with the thought that the government is actually staking claim to the precious greens. I request The Telegraph to continue the crusade. A clean and healthy environment is our birthright.

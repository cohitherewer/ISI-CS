	With the resonance of music, spring in each step, students were at their unleashed best at the fourth edition of Kolaahal, the annual fete of The Heritage School.         
	Though Kolaahal means chaos in Bengali, to us, it means celebration. We have also displayed handicrafts made from recycled material to arrest degradation of the environment, said Pranesh Kar Roy of Class VII.         
	The daylong event had four parts  Rangmanch (the cultural programme), Krirangan (the sports section), Kala Kshetra (an art and craft exhibition) and Annapurna (the food court). The cultural programme included a street play on biodiversity and preserving the ecosystem, dance numbers and patriotic songs. The high point of the show was Musically Yours, where the children produced sounds using percussion instruments, including an earthen pot and sandpaper.         
	Painters Samir Aich and Sanatan Dinda inaugurated the art exhibition. The paintings by the children are good enough to be framed and sent to exhibitions, said Aich.         
	The paintings included Durga and her entourage, the childs interpretation of his dining room and classroom. The exhibition included potterywork like pitchers, masks, an Egyptian Pharaoh, brightly painted or in terra cotta finish, up for sale. With hands dipped in clay, some students were working at the potters wheel, and others at a weavers loom.        
	Weaving is not tough, one just needs to be patient and keep track of the threads, said Mansi Agarwal, whose wall hangings were on display.         
	Another stall had handicrafts made of recycled materials like bottles doubling as decorative vases, lampshades from ice cream sticks, and key rings from plastic spoons. The game stalls saw the maximum footfall. At the food court, organised by students and their parents, one could gorge on goodies from bhelpuri to pasta. At Krirangan, students tried out rappelling, kayaking and rock climbing.         
	The enthusiasm of the students make it special for us. Its also the only day when they can bring money to school and buy food, said principal Seema Sapru.         
	Members of the Interact Club put up game and jewellery stalls. The funds raised would be given to the underprivileged. Kolaahal also showcased The British Council International School Award Exhibition, an exchange programme of The Heritage with 22 schools in 16 nations, like Germany, France, the UK, Italy, The Netherlands and Argentina.

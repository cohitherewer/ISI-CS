The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Death term for bicycle murder 
                                                                                                               Death term for bicycle murder 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 20-year-old youth, Rabin Mali, was awarded the death sentence on Thursday for killing a 12-year-old boy.        
	Rabin killed Avishek Roy on November 19, 2007, after the child refused to let him ride his bicycle.        
	Awarding the sentence, Parthasarathi Mukherjee, the judge of the fast-track third court of Barrackpore, said it was the rarest of the rare case as Mali had duped Avisheks mother saying he was taking the boy fishing.        
	Rabin tied a nylon fishing reel around Avisheks neck. This clearly reveals that Rabin had strangulated him. To make sure that he died, Rabin dumped him in the pond, Mukherjee observed.         
	He said the punishment was also meant to set an example for others.        
	A death sentence awarded by a lower court has to be approved by the high court before it can be executed.         
	According to court records, Avishek, a resident of Anandapuri in Barrackpore, was escorted out of his home by Rabin to a nearby pond on the pretext of fishing. Rabin then beat Avishek senseless, tied his hands and legs and threw him in the pond. The body was recovered the next day.        
	Avisheks bicycle had been missing since his death. Titagar police found it in Rabins house. The cops interrogated three friends of Rabin  Bullet, Tarit and Siuli  and came to know that he bore a grudge against Avishek for not allowing him to ride his new bicycle. The trio were with Rabin before he went to Avisheks house on the day of the murder.        
	Rabin admitted to killing Avishek. The court released the other three as they were not directly involved with the murder.         
	Public prosecutor Joyprakash Sen said Rabin was charged under IPC sections 302 (murder) and 201 (criminal conspiracy). The judge took exception to the heinous nature of the crime. The way Rabin lied to Avisheks mother proves that this was a murder in cold blood, said Pritish Dasgupta, another public prosecutor. Rabins lawyers said they would appeal against the sentence.

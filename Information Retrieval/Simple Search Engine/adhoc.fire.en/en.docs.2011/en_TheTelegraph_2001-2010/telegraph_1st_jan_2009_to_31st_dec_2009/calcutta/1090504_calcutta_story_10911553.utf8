The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | One held for murder
                                                                                                               One held for murder
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 30-year-old youth was arrested in Ekbalpore on Sunday on the charge of killing a loan recovery agent from Kidderpore in September 2007.        
	Police said Mohammed Gaffar, picked up from his Maulana Mohammed Ali Road home, and Chikna Raju, arrested earlier, had stabbed 28-year-old Fazlur Rahman in Shikohabad, Uttar Pradesh. The duo had allegedly taken Fazlur to Shikohabad on the pretext of attending a friends wedding.        
	The murder is believed to have been the fallout of political rivalry. Gaffar was a supporter of the Forward Bloc. Fazlur, too, was a supporter of the party but later joined the Trinamul Congress, said an officer investigating the case.

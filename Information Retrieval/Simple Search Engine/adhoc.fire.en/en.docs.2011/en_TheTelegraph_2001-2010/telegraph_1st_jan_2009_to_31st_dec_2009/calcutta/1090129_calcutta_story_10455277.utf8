	It was a packed house of students and seasoned skywatchers at the astronomy and astrophysics workshop organised earlier this month by the Manindra-Narayan Astronomical Trust  an organisation of amateur astronomers  at the Paschim Banga Bangla Akademi in the Nandan complex. The event marked 2009 as the international year of astronomy.         
	Six speakers, including scientists, a journalist and a veteran skywatcher, spoke on subjects ranging from the origin of matter in dark energy, the development of telescopes to Galileo as the father of modern astronomy.        
	President Debiprosad Duari spoke on the projects lined up by the International Astronomical Union for this year. The most interesting is the 100 hours of astronomy, under which skywatching activities will be organised in 138 countries, including India, in early April. Besides, many students around the world will be given Galileoscopes, Duari said. A Galileoscope is an easy-to-assemble-and-use telescope similar to Galileos invention.         
	Workshops like these are very encouraging, said Akasdeep Bhadra, a first-year student of Heritage Institute of Technology and an astronomy aficionado. His favourite was Duaris lecture on the present scope and future prospects in astronomy.         
	Students from schools like St Thomas, Dasnagar, and St Xaviers School, Rishra, attended the workshop. City kids have access to places like the MP Birla Planetarium and the Science City. We have to reach out to those who are far away, explained Duari.         
	Soumen Mukherjee, of the 30-year-old Skywatchers Association, spoke about the problems faced by amateurs while skywatching. What we see through our telescopes at home is very different from the vivid cosmic images seen on the Internet. Only a few constellations are visible, and are no more than distant dots.

	Eight teams staged various aspects of identity crisis at Drama Ties 2008, an inter-college drama competition hosted by Presidency College, in association with British Council.         
	Seven colleges and universitiesJadavpur University (JU), Calcutta University (CU), Asutosh College, St Xaviers College, Ramakrishna Mission Residential College, Narendrapur, National Institute of Technology, Durgapur, and Presidency College  took part in the December event. Asutosh College sent two teams, one each from the arts and science faculties. Theatre personality Ramanjit Kaur, critic Samik Bandyopadhyay and director Goutam Halder judged the event.         
	JU bagged the best play award, while Presidency College was the run-ner up. JUs play, Let the Number Be X, started with some people chatting while travelling on a train. The second sequence was that of a group watching a political rally. The scenes stressed on the fact that however individualistic one may be, he is still lost in a crowd. The best part of the play was its rewind technique that took the audience back to where the play had started.         
	Presidency College presented an adaptation of Samuel Becketts End Game called In the Depths of Despair.         
	The winners received a cash prize of Rs 5,000 and the runner-up Rs 3,000. Each individual awardee received Rs 500.

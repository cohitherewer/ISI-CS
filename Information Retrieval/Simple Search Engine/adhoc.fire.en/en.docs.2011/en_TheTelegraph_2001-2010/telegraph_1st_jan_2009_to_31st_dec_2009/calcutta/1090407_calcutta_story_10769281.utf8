	The Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) is set to launch a slew of courses across its campuses in the coming academic year.         
	First on the ISI list is a PhD in statistical quality control and operations research. There isnt enough research happening in this field, which is why we are offering a PhD in the course, said Shankar Pal, the director of the ISI.        
	Around eight PhD students will get a fellowship for the programme and can enrol on any of the ISI campuses.        
	The institute will also offer an MTech in quality management science on its Bangalore campus, to be conducted in conjunction with the Hyderabad and Chennai centres. It will have 20 to 25 students.        
	The ISI has plans to start computer science departments on the Bangalore and Delhi campuses by July 2009. The institute is also looking to consolidate its research in bio-informatics by creating a unit dedicated to the subject.        
	So far, research in bio-informatics has been conducted by departments like biology, computer science, statistics, mathematics, chemistry and physics. We want to consolidate all this into one unit, said Pal.

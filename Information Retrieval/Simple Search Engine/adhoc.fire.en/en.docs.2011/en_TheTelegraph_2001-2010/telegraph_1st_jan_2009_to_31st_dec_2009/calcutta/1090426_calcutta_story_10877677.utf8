The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A court for environment 
                                                                                                               City Light
										      A court for environment                                         Can a global lsquo;green rsquo; court rid Calcutta of the   auto raj? A Telegraph picture      
	Do we need an international court of environment? Stephen Hockman QC (Queens Counsel), a former chairman of Bar Council in the UK, thinks so. The eminent lawyer, whose areas of speciality include environment, health and safety and regulatory law, was recently in town. He was delivering this years Sarkar Lecture, instituted by senior advocate Sudipto Sarkar in memory of his parents Prabhas Chandra Sarkar and Sunity Sarkar, at the British Council on April 13.         
	Hockman spoke about the politics of global warming and climate crimes, the reason the world needs such a court. He pointed out that China is held responsible for an enormous amount of carbon emission. But it has been found that a substantial part of these emissions are caused by the manufacture of goods for the US market or export to other countries. This would be the USs off-shore emission: a matter the court, presumably, could look into.         
	So who can be hauled up before the court, which would incorporate the work of other global institutions like the Kyoto Protocol?         
	The court would provide resolution between states and would also be useful for multinational businesses in ensuring environmental laws are kept to in every country.         
	The court has the right backing. Gordon Brown, the British Prime Minister, has said the idea of the international court will be taken into account at the Copenhagen climate conference in December, when the Kyoto Protocol will be looked at again. The concept is supported by public figures abroad, including actress Judi Dench.         
	Someone from Calcutta can seek redress too, Hockman reassured.         
	He said this despite being in the city for three days and having, perhaps, seen the garbage and the plastic piling up, the autorickshaws running amok. Though the heat is obviously a concern to everyone, environment doesnt figure anywhere on the politicians agenda. How relevant is the idea of an international court in such a city?         
	There are other problems with such a court in a developing country. Professor Jayanta Bandyopadhyay of IIM Calcutta said that at the Copenhagen summit, a World Bank report is likely to point at India and China as important producers of fossil fuel-based carbon-dioxide  the bad CO2  and there may be a pressure on these two countries to agree to legally binding emission control. But half the population of these countries, especially in the rural areas, does not belong to that carbon category  they do not burn petrol but use firewood or bio-mass.         
	Why should half of a country suffer because of the other half? How would the court address that?         
	Hockman agreed that it was an important issue. As for Calcutta, he felt that the city was made of survivors, who seemed to escape a terminal collision with a vehicle every second. There was no reason to believe that Calcutta wouldnt realise its own good one day. One has to be optimistic.         
	But, he reminded, one deserves the politicians one gets.         
	Adda for Earth        
	The Green Adda on Earth Day (April 22) at Saturday Club, organised by India Trees Foundation, discussed the topic: Is the Earth getting warmer and how to combat it. The answer to that question is obviously yes, agreed a member of the group.         
	Yes, Calcutta certainly is getting warmer. There was further proof as the adda progressed. The hall was plunged into darkness just as the first speaker got up to speak.         
	Ravi Menon, the president of the group, stressed that the shrinking greens is a real problem. The most interesting insight came from chief guest Tapas Ghatak. During his many years at the urban development department of the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority, Ghatak amassed a wealth of information on the changing city.         
	In satellite pictures, Calcutta looks like a white patch, he said, because of the missing greens. Comparing the data of 1980-86 and of 2005, he showed how the urban areas have come up at the cost of the rural and wetland areas.         
	Ghatak said the ground water is drying up and is interrupted by unplanned withdrawals at too many points. I can only share this information. I have no remedy. The remedy must come from everyone, he signed off.        
	Green quiz        
	The katatel users may not have cared but Calcuttas corporates didnt forget to commemorate Earth Day. Case in point was the Green Biz Quiz 2009, in its fifth edition this year, organised by Environment Management Centre, Indian Chamber of Commerce, in association with The American Center.         
	The quiz saw eight teams, from companies including Damodar Valley Corporation, NTPC, CESC, SAIL, MN Dastur and Tata Steel.         
	The participants were stumped by the very first question. Which country has the highest CO2 emission per capita? asked Suman K. Mukherjee, the quizmaster and director of JD Birla Institute.         
	The answer, which at least three teams thought was the US, turned out to be the UAE. What is the meaning of the Japanese term Tsunami? This time the answers ranged from tidal wave to big wave, huge wave to earthquake under water (yes really!), but the correct one harbour wave. With six rounds of more green thought and an address by US consul-general Beth A. Payne, one of the hottest afternoons in recent times was well spent.         
	Chandrima S. Bhattacharya, Poulomi Banerjee and Malini Banerjee

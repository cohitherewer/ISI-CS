The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Burst of rain brings Celsius relief
                                                                                                               Burst of rain brings Celsius relief
  - Minimum temperature plummets post-Holi but hot days ahead          SUVRO ROY                                                  
	The seasons first thunderstorm struck Calcutta early on Thursday, bringing down the minimum temperature to two degrees below normal from four degrees above normal within 24 hours.        
	The rain was accompanied by winds blowing at speeds ranging from 55 to 62kmph, but Met officials arent calling it a Norwester.        
	It was caused by a trough of low pressure that had moved rapidly eastwards from the western part of the country. So it wasnt exactly a Norwester, though it did bring the city relief from the balmy weather, said D.N. Talapatra, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.        
	The minimum temperature on Thursday was 19.4 degree Celsius, two degrees below normal. The minimum temperature on Wednesday was 23.7 degrees Celsius, four degrees above normal.        
	The Alipore weather office recorded 25.9mm of rain during the thundershower, which started at 2.50am and lasted around half an hour. It was the first burst of rain in the city in three months.        
	The bad news is that the weather isnt likely to stay this way. We expect the minimum temperature to rise again on Friday. The cloud cover over the city wont let surface heat escape, a Met official said.        
	There wont, however, be a significant change in the maximum temperature, the official said.        
	The maximum temperature on Thursday was 33.2 degrees Celsius.        
	The city had a warm winter this year, with the lowest minimum temperature being recorded at 12.9 degrees Celsius. The minimum temperature had dropped to 10.8 degrees in February 2008.         
	The North Wind wasnt strong enough and the western disturbances (low-pressure systems that originate in the Mediterranean sea ) that passed over the northern part of the country between December and February never moved towards Bengal, a weather expert said.

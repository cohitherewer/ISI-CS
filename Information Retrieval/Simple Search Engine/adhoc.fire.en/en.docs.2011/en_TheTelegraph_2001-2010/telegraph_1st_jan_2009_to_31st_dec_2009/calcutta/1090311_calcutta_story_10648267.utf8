                      Melodies by moonlight                    Dubbed by the Israeli media as the most important and influential personality in classical music in Israel, Gil Shohat is certainly one of the leading and most prolific musicians of his generation. He has already composed nine large-scale symphonies, 10 concertos for various instruments, three operas, several oratorios, cantatas, solo vocal pieces and dozens of chamber and piano pieces, performing more than 80 concerts a year worldwide, both as a conductor and pianist. Full of emotion, atmosphere and drama, his compositions are fresh, innovative and communicative, without attempting to break any stylistic traditions. As a pianist, Shohat has given recitals and solo performances with orchestras in 25 countries, including most European capitals, the Far East, India and the Americas. In Israel, he performed his first recital at the age of 12 and by the time he was 16, Shohat had performed as a soloist with every major national orchestra, including the Israel Philharmonic. This evening, he presents Moonlight Recital, a solo piano recital in which he will play pieces from Beethoven, Schubert, Debussy and Lizst, as well as some of his own compositions. Hosted by Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) and the Embassy of Israel.                  Event: Piano recital by Israeli pianist Gil Shohat When: Tomorrow at 6.30 pm Where: Satyajit Ray Auditorium, Rabindranath Tagore Centre, ICCR, 9A Ho Chi Minh Sarani

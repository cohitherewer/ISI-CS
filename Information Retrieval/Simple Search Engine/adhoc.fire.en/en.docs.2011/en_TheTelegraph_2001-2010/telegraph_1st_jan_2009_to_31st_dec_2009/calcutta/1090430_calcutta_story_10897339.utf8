                      Poetic expressions                    A painter and printmaker of outstanding merit, Rokeya Sultana has ingrained in her vision and sensibility a fine lyrical resonance of all she has lived and experienced. Densely redolent of the qualities of ones favourite poetry, her works mirror an image of life and nature in Bengals countryside. The ongoing show of her works in mixed media and gouache bears testimony to her power to illuminate poetic emotions through her brushstrokes. In some of her canvases, washes in gentle, sensitive shades of blue, pink or warm yellow and orange, sprawl and spread like rolling surf on the sea, creating placid areas and pools of colour that wonderfully blend and synchronise with one another. Colour-fields in varied tones or in marine and cobalt blue throw up fluid relief forms and shapes like floating clouds in an autumn sky. In others, yellows, greens and blues in fine-graded, striated and granular washes, create a crisp, motley surface that suggests configurations of earth and water as seen from an aerial viewpoint. The artist brings to bear upon her canvases a totality of her vision in which her nature-soaked perception of life acquires richly complex textures and tones from her deeply-felt personal and private moods and meanings, passions and emotions. Etched on abstract naturescapes are figures, mostly female nudes of rhythmic sensuous curves, in free and flowing lines, gliding gently on the surface. In other frames, the figures and forms enact the myth of love and passion, exuding a tender sense of tension between the figurative and the abstract, and suggestive of both nature as the eternally feminine and as the source of all the stimuli of the artists imaginative life.

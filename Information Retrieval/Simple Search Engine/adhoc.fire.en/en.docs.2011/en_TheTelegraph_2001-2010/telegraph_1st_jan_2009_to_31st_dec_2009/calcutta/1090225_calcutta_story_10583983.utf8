The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Visas smoother, takers fewer
                                                                                                               Visas smoother, takers fewer
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The long queues in front of the US visa office have shortened with the downturn robbing many an Indian of a slice of the great American dream.        
	According to officials at the US consulate, the number of temporary visa applications from India has decreased significantly since mid-2008.        
	In the past six months we have seen a 15 to 20 per cent decrease in demand for US visas in India, said Peter G. Kaestner, the minister counselor for consular affairs and US consul-general in New Delhi, who was in the city to inaugurate a visa facility at the American consulate on Tuesday.        
	The drop in demand varies across the country. Chennai has seen the maximum decrease while in Calcutta, the fall in demand is 15 to 20 per cent since last September, said Kaestner.        
	But this being the lean season for visa applications, the real picture will emerge only in summer, when students and interns usually make a beeline for the US.        
	The new visa section is part of a multi-phase expansion project for improving consular facilities in eastern India.        
	The number of interview windows has been increased from four to seven. There will be four American officers instead of two and the local staff strength has been increased by 30 per cent.        
	We also have a separate visa entrance, making visa processing simpler and quicker, said the US consul-general in Calcutta, Beth A. Payne. Consul Deborah Miller demonstrated the process of visa application and interview at the inauguration.

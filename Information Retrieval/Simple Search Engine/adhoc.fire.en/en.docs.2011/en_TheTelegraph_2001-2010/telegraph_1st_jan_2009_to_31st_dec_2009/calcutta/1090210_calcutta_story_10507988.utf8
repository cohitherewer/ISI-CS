                      Tradition in contemporary art                    The single most fundamental continuity in the artistic tradition of Bengal is, perhaps, the art of its patuas, whose interpretations of religious myths and popular legends reflect the hopes and fears of the common man even to this day. The Frame, the ongoing group exhibition of recent works by contemporary artists, showcases creations that are all, at some level, influenced by this tradition. Ancient Indian literature, with its epics, legends and myths, have deeply influenced the works of Soumitra Kar (a painting by him appears here), which finds expression in his portrayal of folk and religious festivals. The works of Bhaskar Bhattacharjee are not restricted by tradition. But his swift black outlines give his figures an expressiveness that is very similar to that found in Kalighat paintings. Simplicity is the main criterion of the paintings of Debashis Samanta which are rooted in ancient and folk art of Bengal. The paintings of Prangopal Ghosh explore his feelings about nature and the seasons at a metaphysical level. Themes that focus on the problems of urban life find expression in the works of Chayan Roy. Spiritual quest as an escape from human desire forms the core of Biswajit Sahas paintings. The works of Sandhyakar Kayal explore the philosophy of co-existence of the physical world with the one that lies beyond it.                  Event: An exhibition of paintings by a group of artists When: Till February 15; 4 pm - 8 pm Where: Birla Academy of Art amp; Culture

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mamata effect
                                                                                                               Mamata effect

	With the setback to the red bastion in the state, certain things need refurbishing. Especially colour schemes.         
	A woman calling an older friend was told: Tumi aamar shobuj selaam niyo (Accept my green salute). The red salute seems a thing of the past. Apparently a tea-stall owner seems to have remarked that he will not sell laal cha (tea liquor, literal translation: red tea) any more. Green tea, of course, can be a real substitute, but would Calcuttans buy it from roadside tea stalls?         
	And there is this huge demand for green abir. Not only in the city. At Hasnabad, about 2,000 Trinamul supporters took out a victory procession on Friday. Their only problem: there was a great paucity of green abir.         
	Very very sari        
	Mamata Banerjees simple handloom weaves are creating a stir almost as much as her victory since she went to the capital clutching the Dhanekhali for Sonia Gandhi.         
	Much is being said about a much-desired image makeover for Mamata.         
	A random survey revealed what Calcuttans would like to put in her shopping bag. One considerate person, thinking of the long michhils she organises under the blazing sun, said he would like to slip in a nice pair of slippers and a sunscreen lotion in Mamatas bag.         
	A young lady at a nightclub said a crisp cotton sari, a smart pair of sandals, basic make-up and a nice hand-bag would do. A 24-year-old exclaimed that she would just give her a nice congratulations card, in exchange for the promise of no bandhs.         
	But apart from the fact that Didi will not get an image makeover, for she is unthinkable in a crisp or colourful sari, observers have noted another thing. Mamata Banerjees saris may look soiled, but often they are of a very fine quality with exquisite borders.       POULOMI BANERJEE

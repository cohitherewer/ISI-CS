The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Shanties gutted by blaze
                                                                                                               Shanties gutted by blaze
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A blaze gutted 80 shanties and left 300 people homeless in Tiljala, off the EM Bypass, on Sunday morning.        
	No casualties were reported in the fire that broke out around 10.30am and raged for around 45 minutes at the Pagladanga No. 8 slum, near Science City.        
	Three fire tenders brought the blaze under control. According to firemen, most of the shanties were gutted before they reached the spot.        
	The fire most probably started from makeshift ovens of dried leaves and wood on which some residents were cooking. Forensic tests will be carried out to determine what caused the fire, said Gopal Bhattacharya, the director of fire and emergency services.        
	The blaze spread quickly because the shanties were made up of inflammable material and stored combustible goods, said a fire fighter.        
	At the blaze site, the cry of the homeless mingled with the stench of the ruins.        
	I have lost everything. My house, my shop next to it and my savings. I do not know how to provide for the education of my two young children, cried Gouranga Das, a scrap dealer.        
	I was about to leave for my students house, when I heard screams and noticed a hut ablaze about 30 metres away. Within minutes, my hut was also on fire. I could not save anything except my wallet, cellphone and some clothes. Even my educational certificates were burnt, Nikhil Lal Sarkar, who offers private tuition in Bengali, said holding his wifes hand as smoke bellowed out of their 10ft x 10ft hut.        
	The blaze appears to be an accident. However, we are awaiting the forensic report, said an officer of Tiljala police station.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mother watches daughters budget
                                                                                                               Mother watches daughters budget
          CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE                          Gayatri Devi watches the budget at her home on Friday. (Amit Datta)                                  
	Mamata Banerjees family members back home at Kalighat had huddled before the TV screen much before the railway minister took the podium in Parliament to present her third railway budget.        
	We do not watch news channels in the morning but today was special. How could we miss didis budget? said Mamatas sister-in-law Kalpana Banerjee.        
	Ensconced in the middle of the bedroom of 30B Harish Chatterjee Street was Mamatas mother Gayatri Devi. The ailing octogenarian might not have understood the budget arithmetic but that did not deter her from sitting through the proceedings, her eyes glued to the 15-inch TV screen.        
	Eta toh prothombar noy. O toh ageo rail-er budget korechhey (This is not the first time. She had presented the railway budget earlier, too), the proud mother said.        
	Around her was son Swapan and daughters-in-law Kalpana and Lata. Sitting close by was Mamatas aide Shovan Chatterjee, who had come to watch the budget with his leaders family.        
	Mamatas comments during the budget had the family in splits, especially when she proposed the introduction of non-stop trains for the Northeast and Bihar. Abhi ek dozen milega, baad mein aur lagey ga toh dega (Now there will be dozen trains. If needed, there will be more), the minister announced. Didi will never make a budget only for Bengal. She will ensure that all states are benefited, said Swapan.        
	Supporters outside the house kept shouting Didi zindabad, Lalu murdabad.        
	Gayatri Devis much-awaited call came after the post-budget press conference. Mamata asked her mother how she liked watching the budget on TV. Gayatri Devi enjoyed every bit of the proceedings, said a source close to the family.

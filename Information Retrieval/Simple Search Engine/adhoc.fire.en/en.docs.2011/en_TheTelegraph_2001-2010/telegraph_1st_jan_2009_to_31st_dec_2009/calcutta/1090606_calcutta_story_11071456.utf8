                      Devotional offering through dance                    The love between Lord Krishna and his devoted Gopis is the yearning of the living beings (Jivatman) for unison with the Supreme Being (Paramatman). This shuddha-prema bhakti (devotion steeped in pure love) for Lord Krishna has been professed not only in spirituality but also through Indian classical music, dance and other art forms. The lotus-eyed, beautiful blue Lord, dressed in golden-yellow attire, bedecked with simple wild flowers is the sakar roop of Param-Brahma (tangible form of the Supreme Being) and also of the Antaryami (one who is a part of the human existence). The total concept of Krishna is an experience and cannot be fully perceived by the five senses only. His Hladini shakti (ecstasy-giving energy ) is Radha. The relationship of Krishna and Radha is likened to sugar (madhu) and sweetness (madhurata) that cannot be separated. The core of Odissi dance lies in this spirituality. In Odissi (and its precursors), dancing devotional numbers to Ashtapadis from Geet Govindam has been a regular part of Jagannath Temple service since the 13th century and today forms a major gamut of the Odissi repertoire. Odissi danseuse Sanchita Bhattacharya presents a solo recital, Krishnamay, this evening. The composition is based on extracts from Geet Govindam, explaining and expressing the dancers total devotional love and surrender to Krishna, the Srestha and Prestha (paramount and the most loved one) being.                    Event: Krishnamay  Odissi dance recital by Sanchita Bhattacharya When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Weavers Studio Centre for the Arts, 94 Ballygunge Place, 4245

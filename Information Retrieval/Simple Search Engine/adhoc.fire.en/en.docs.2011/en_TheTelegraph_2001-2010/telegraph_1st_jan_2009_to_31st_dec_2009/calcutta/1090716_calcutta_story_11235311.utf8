The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Budget hotel set to take wings
                                                                                                               Budget hotel set to take wings
  - Airport finalises hospitality address to plug the gap of low-cost rooms          SANJAY MANDAL                                                  
	The city airport will soon have a budget hotel for fliers who are forced to stay overnight in the terminals for lack of low-cost accommodation in the compound.        
	We badly need a budget hotel as the retiring rooms and dormitories are too few compared with the demand, said an official of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport.        
	Sources said the hotel  likely to be developed through public-private partnership  would come up on a plot opposite the international terminal where the authorities had initially planned to build a power house.        
	We have decided to set up the power house in the integrated terminal building coming up as part of the airport modernisation project, near the approach road to the domestic terminal. The plot for the power house can be used to build the hotel, the official said.        
	Officials hope the hotel would have a high occupancy rate given that there are not enough retiring rooms and dormitories to accommodate passengers. The international terminal has eight double-bed retiring rooms and the domestic terminal, 23. Besides, the domestic terminal has 20 more beds in the airconditioned dormitory and 27 in the general dormitory.        
	Now, consider the passenger count. The domestic terminal registers 7,000 footfall daily and the international terminal, 1,500. There are also passengers in transit and those arriving in the early hours who need accommodation. Passengers from the districts who book tickets on early morning flights also prefer to stay overnight in the airport compound instead of putting up in hotels in adjoining areas, said an airport manager. The tariff of the hotel would be planned in a way that average fliers can afford it.        
	The existing hospitality address in the airport compound has been lying idle for a decade. The ex-ITDC property, Airport Ashok, was earlier poised for a Rs 300-crore composite makeover. The Delhi-based Dharampal Satyapal (DS) Group, which bought the property, had grand plans for a 250-key five-star hotel, a 100-room budget hotel, a 44,000-sq ft convention centre and a 300,000-sq ft retail mall. But the downturn and delay in obtaining clearances have stalled the project, which was to be inaugurated by end-2010. We hope to complete the structure by 2012, said a DS Group spokesperson.

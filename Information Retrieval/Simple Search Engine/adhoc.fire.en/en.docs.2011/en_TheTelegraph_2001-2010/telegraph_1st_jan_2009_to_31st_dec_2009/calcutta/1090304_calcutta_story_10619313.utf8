	The chief minister on Tuesday asked transport department officials to start preliminary work for the proposed East-West Metro. Transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury later announced that Gammon India Ltd was awarded the contract for constructing the elevated 6km tracks between Sector V (near Wipro) and Phoolbagan.        
	Chowdhury, along with state chief secretary A.M. Chakraborti and Subesh Das, the principal secretary to the chief minister, met Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Writers Buildings on Tuesday to discuss the project.        
	The elevated stretch will have stations at Karunamoyee, Central Park, City Centre, Bengal Chemicals and Salt Lake stadium. The 8km track between Phoolbagan and Howrah Maidan, with stations at Sealdah, Central, Mahakaran and Howrah will be underground. A tunnel below the Hooghly, at a depth of 35 metres, will link Mahakaran and Howrah stations.        
	Bhattacharjee had announced that East-West Metro would be commissioned by October 31, 2014.

                      Remembering Keya                    One of the most talented and versatile actresses to have stepped on the Bengali stage, Keya Chakrabarti became a household name in Bengal in the 1970s. Despite hailing from a humble background, she rose to popularity by sheer dint of her hard work, dedication and acting prowess. An intelligent, sensitive actress who brought to life any role that she portrayed on stage, she was always the heart of any production that she was part of. Some plays in which she delivered landmark performances include Teen Poysar Pala, Bhalo Manush (a scene from the play appears here), Antigone, Nati Binodini and Natyakarer Sandhane Chhati Charitra, amongst others. Puritans and critics of Bengali theatre still maintain that the void created by her sudden death has not been filled even 30 years hence. To mark her 67th birth anniversary, Uhinee Kolkata hosts Ananta Keya Bikel, a two-day programme focusing on the contemporary theatre of Bengal. It begins this evening with the 3rd Keya Chakrabarti Memorial Talk to be delivered by Debashish Majumdar on The Reflection of Politics on Contemporary Theatre: Inheritance of Our Tradition. To be followed by the play Tumi Daak Diyechho Kon Sakale, presented by Uhinee (at 7.30 pm). Tomorrows programme begins with the childrens drama Buro Lokta by Barrackpore Swapnil (dir: Prachet Gupta; at 5.30 pm). Also, a seminar on Childrens Theatre: Our National Practice Methods (at 6.15 pm) and finally, play Shilpi by Uhinee (at 7 pm).

          A STAFF REPORTER                           The building where Arati Das lived. (Soumen Bhattacharjee)                                   
	A 65-year-old widow living alone since moving out of her sons Salt Lake home eight years ago has been found dead in her north Calcutta flat with the main door locked from outside.        
	Arati Dass neighbours in the four-storeyed block at Netaji Colony, off Tobin Road, called police late on Thursday evening after the stench in the building since the previous day became unbearable.         
	When the door to the 1,000sq ft flat was opened around 10.30pm with a duplicate key brought by Aratis son Ashis, the origin of the stench was confirmed but the police couldnt find the body.        
	Everything in the rooms was so neatly arranged that it didnt look like a suspected murder victim was lying somewhere, an investigator said.        
	A second search revealed a highly decomposed body in the storage compartment of a bed.        
	The police said Arati possibly died several days ago. They also found strangulation marks on her neck.        
	Son Ashis, in his early forties, would visit her sometimes and speak to her over phone but didnt seem to know that his mother hadnt been seen in the neighbourhood for several days. Raju Das, who works in one of the shops on the ground floor of the building, said he last spotted Mashima on Saturday evening climbing the stairs to reach her first-floor flat.        
	Ashis, who manufactures transformers, said he had no reason to suspect that his mother would be murdered for gain or any other reason. She shifted to Netaji Colony in mid-2000. I would visit her often and also keep in touch over phone. I last visited her around three weeks ago, he said.         
	Neighbours said Arati shifted from Salt Lake after her husband Salil Dass death, allegedly because she didnt get along well with her daughter-in-law. Ashis purchased the flat for his mother.         
	Manju Ghosh, who lives on the second floor of the apartment, said Arati was a reclusive person who would immerse herself in religious rituals. She often visited Dakshineswar and other temples.        
	An investigator said the key to the lock on the main door was missing. The other key was with her son; so there is a strong possibility of foul play.        
	On June 3, a 43-year-old spinster who lived alone was found dead in a Behala house that was locked from outside.

                                                                                                               Cops sniff dummy racket 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The 11 dummy examinees arrested in a Salt Lake school on Sunday during the Madhya Pradesh medical entrance test were hired by a racket that had also fielded dummy candidates in the state JEE in 2007, suspect police.        
	The 11 arrested youths, aged between 21 and 25 and hailing from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and other states, were remanded in police custody till July 14.        
	They are meritorious students and were promised Rs 1 lakh each for taking the entrance test. The operatives of the racket used to take Rs 3-4 lakh from each original candidate. The original and the dummy candidates did not know each other, said Debabrata Das, the additional superintendent of Bidhannagar police.        
	Some youths had earlier appeared in entrance examinations as dummy candidates. Most of them are from well-to-do families and do this only for pocket money, added the investigator.        
	The 11 were paid a part of the amount and put up in hotels on VIP Road and Howrah near station. They have revealed the names of five middlemen.        
	We are trying to ascertain whether the racket was involved in fielding dummy candidates in the Bengal JEE, added Das. Over 20 people were arrested in 2007 in connection with fake candidates appearing in the state JEE.

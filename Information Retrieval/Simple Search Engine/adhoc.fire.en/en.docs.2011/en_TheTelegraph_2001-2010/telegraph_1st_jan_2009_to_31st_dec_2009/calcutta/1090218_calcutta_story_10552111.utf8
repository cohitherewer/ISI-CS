The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Protests over tainted water
                                                                                                               Protests over tainted water
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The civic body on Tuesday claimed that overflowing drains and use of mono-block (household) pumps in illegal buildings had caused the outbreak of diarrhoea in Garden Reach, while residents continued to protest water contamination in the area.        
	A four-year-old girl had died on Monday, allegedly after drinking water contaminated with sewage.        
	No new diarrhoea case was reported in any of the three medical camps set up by the civic health department in the Tikiapara area on Tuesday.        
	Chief engineer (water supply) Bibhas Maity said overflowing drains and overuse of mono-block pumps were causing the sewage to mix with the water in the pipes.        
	Residents, however, were not ready to buy the argument. They demonstrated against the civic bodys failure to supply clean drinking water when mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya visited the area on Tuesday. They also blocked Circular Garden Reach Road.        
	When local Congress MLA Ram Pyare Ram and his supporters were denied entry in the borough office at Ramnagar, they blocked the Ramnagar crossing for over two hours. The blockade was lifted at 5pm.        
	Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay ordered replacement of the water mains in the area to minimise the risk of contamination in future.        
	We visited the nursing home at Paharpur where people suffering from diarrhoea were admitted on Monday. We are monitoring their treatment, said chief municipal health officer DebDwaipayan Chattopadhyay.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CAT troubles ease on third day
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      CAT troubles ease on third day
          A STAFF REPORTER                                             Examinees outside a centre on Sunday. (Sanat Kr Sinha)      
	All scheduled examinations were held on Day Three of the Common Admission Test (CAT) but some examinees complained of technical glitches.        
	The glitches included delay in logging in and screens occasionally going blank during the two-hour test.        
	After tests were cancelled in the past two days, we were apprehensive about what would happen on the third day with the number of people taking the test going up. But thankfully everything went off well today, said Kaushik Kapoor of Erudite, a coaching institute in the city, on Monday.        
	Disruptions were reported at the Pailan College of Management and Technology, where log-ins were delayed and three screens reportedly went blank in the middle of the test.        
	I am glad that I was able to take the test and there was no problem. But it was unnerving to see people complaining of blank screens next to me, said a student who sat for the test at the Pailan centre on Monday.        
	For the 170-odd examinees in Calcutta whose tests got cancelled on Saturday and Sunday, the next few days are going to be spent in anxiety. Not just about the test but about its schedule as well.        
	I selected my test schedule after considering a lot of factors. My semester examination starts on December 8. I wanted to appear for the entrance test early so that I could concentrate on my college exam. But now I dont know when I will get to take CAT, said Moulina Kuiti, whose test at the Heritage Institute of Technology in the second session on Sunday was cancelled.        
	Many are sceptical whether Prometric, the testing service provider, can conduct the rescheduled tests within the 10-day window.         
	Given their record, I doubt whether they would be able to honour their promise of rescheduling cancelled exams before December 7, said Moumita Saha (name changed on request), whose test got cancelled on Saturday.        
	Authorities at the CAT test centres are also unhappy with Prometric, which blamed computer viruses for the glitches.         
	The labs were handed over to the Prometric people three days in advance. They should have checked for viruses, said the director of one of the institutes serving as test centres.        
	The relatively glitch-free third day did nothing to calm the minds of those yet to take the test.        
	The test was conducted smoothly today but what if something goes wrong tomorrow when even more people will take the test. The examinees whose tests are rescheduled would also increase the numbers in the next seven days. Will the servers be able to take the load? wondered a 20-year-old engineering student, who was to take the test on Tuesday.        
	The entrance test conducted by the Indian institutes of management switched from a pen-and-paper to a computerised format this year.         
	Hardware problems hampered the examination on the first two days, forcing the tests of up to 4,000 aspirants across India to be rescheduled.

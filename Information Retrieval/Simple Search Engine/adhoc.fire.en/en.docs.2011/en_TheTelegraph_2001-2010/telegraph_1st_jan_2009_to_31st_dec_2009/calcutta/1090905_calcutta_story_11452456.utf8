          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Friday directed the Indian Botanic Garden director to supervise the maintenance of the premises till further orders.        
	The division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice B. Somadder passed this directive on the basis of a submission made by the state advocate general, Balai Ray.        
	Since a controversy has arisen over the activities of the garden authorities, the court should appoint a person to supervise the maintenance work, the advocate-general told the court.        
	The issue of maintenance of the garden came up when a lawyer representing the authorities told the court that the case regarding felling of trees on the premises and the subsequent court orders had hampered the upkeep of the garden.         
	Many trees in the garden were felled in the Aila effect but the authorities are hesitating to remove the trunks because of the case. As a result, other trees in the garden are being affected, said the lawyer.        
	He also claimed that as the garden is a central government unit, the probe by the Criminal Investigation Department, a state agency, into the felling of trees on the premises should be declared invalid.        
	The court had asked the state government and environment activist Subhash Dutta, a petitioner in the case, to file affidavits stating their stand in regard to the garden lawyers claim.        
	Dutta had moved the court last year after finding that at least 100 trees in the garden had been cut down. A division bench headed by the chief justice asked a three-member committee to probe the matter. In its report, the committee hinted that the felled trees were sold to the timbre mafia.        
	That prompted the high court to ask the CID to probe the matter and file a report. The agency had submitted its report but the court did not make it public after the garden authorities challenged the legality of the investigation.

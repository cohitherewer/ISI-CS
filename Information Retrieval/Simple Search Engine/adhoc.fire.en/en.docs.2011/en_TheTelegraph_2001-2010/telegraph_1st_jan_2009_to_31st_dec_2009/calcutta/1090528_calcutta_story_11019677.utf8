The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Power players in the dark   Roads blocked to restore supply
                                                                                                               Power players in the dark 
  Roads blocked to restore supply          A STAFF REPORTER                                                  
	Calcutta was rendered powerless in more ways than one on Wednesday, with the roadblocks that started the previous afternoon triggering a chain reaction that slowed down the city from north to south.        
	This is the only way to shake the administration out of its slumber. The roadblocks may be inconveniencing others but we are helpless, too said Bijoy Manna, one of those who held up traffic near Netaji Nagar on the EM Bypass in the morning.        
	Mannas house, just behind Peerless Hospital, has been in knee-deep water since Mondays storm. Almost every household in the locality has been without electricity and water for the past three days.        
	Aniruddha Bhattacharya, an IBM executive, and his colleagues on six company buses needed four hours to reach their Sector V office from the Ruby Hospital crossing.         
	There is no electricity in my house either but I dont think blocking roads and holding thousands of people to ransom is the solution, said Aniruddha, who lives in Narendrapur.         
	Like on Tuesday, block-the-Bypass was the protest mantra of people suffering because of the Aila aftermath. Two roadblocks within four kilometres of each other on the Bypass brought traffic from Ultadanga and Garia to a standstill between 8am and 3pm.        
	A group of 100-odd protesters again blocked the Bypass near the Chingrihata crossing around 6pm. We are struggling. The traffic snarl extends till Science City, said an officer of the Beleghata traffic guard around 8pm.        
	Other parts of the city also faced impromptu protests. Blockades were reported near the Behala tram depot and various crossings on Prince Anwar Shah Road throughout the day.        
	Fortunately for air passengers going to the airport, there were no blockades on VIP Road. Traffic on parts of the stretch from Ultadanga to the airport was paralysed from Tuesday afternoon till well past midnight.        
	In Howrah, residents blocked the Carry Road and Garfa Road crossings on Kona Expressway, Drainage Canal Road near Sahanpur, and Makardah Road and GT Road near Ghusuri Kalitala in Bally for two to three hours.

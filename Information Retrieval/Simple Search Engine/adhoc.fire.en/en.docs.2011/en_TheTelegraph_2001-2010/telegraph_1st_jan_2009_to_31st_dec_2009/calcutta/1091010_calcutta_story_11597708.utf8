The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Seniors strip and   flog tech student
                                                                                                               Seniors strip and   flog tech student
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Three engineering students of Haldia Institute of Technology have been suspended for allegedly forcing a fresher to strip and then flogging him with a leather belt for daring to wear headphones on campus.        
	Bruised and mentally battered, 19-year-old Suvarthi Bhattacharya boarded a bus after the incident on Thursday afternoon and reached his Jadavpur home around 9.15pm to tell parents Subroto and Malati that he wouldnt return until his alleged tormentors were punished.        
	The couple immediately admitted the first-year production engineering student to MR Bangur Hospital, where he remained until Friday noon.         
	Based on a complaint lodged by the Bhattacharyas later in the day, the college authorities suspended the three accused  Rupam Ray, Prankrishna Dolui and Swarnavo Ganguly  with immediate effect. We suspended the three students after Suvarthis parents reached my office around 2.30pm and lodged a complaint. Its a serious allegation, said Anjan Mishra, the registrar of Haldia Institute of Technology.        
	Rupam and Prankrishna are second-year students of computer science, while Swarnavo is in his second year of civil engineering.         
	Suvarthi told Metro that he was walking back to his hostel after having lunch outside on Thursday when the accused accosted him.         
	One of the boys asked me why I was wearing headphones. I said I was listening to music, at which they dragged me into their hostel, forced me to strip and flogged me with a belt. Then they asked me to get cigarettes for them in one minute, failing which they would torture me again. I did as they ordered me to but they claimed that I was two seconds past the time limit. I was asked to strip again and lashed, he recalled.        
	The torture allegedly didnt end there. Suvarthi said he was asked to fetch water within a minute, after which he was forced to strip again and flogged. By the time the accused were through with the torture, Suvarthi was barely able to get up. The humiliation hurt me more than the physical pain, he said.        
	Registrar Mishra said an inquiry had been instituted to find out the sequence of events.         
	A disciplinary committee will decide the fate of the accused, if they are found guilty, he added.        
	Jadavpur University had last month expelled three students for ragging and barred them from seeking admission to any other institution for a year.

He was on ventilator since Wednesday morning.

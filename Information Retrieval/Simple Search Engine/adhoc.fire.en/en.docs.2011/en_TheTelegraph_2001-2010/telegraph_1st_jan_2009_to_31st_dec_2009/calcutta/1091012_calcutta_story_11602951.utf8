The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Party-switch trader shot   dead in shop 
                                                                                                               Party-switch trader shot   dead in shop 
          A STAFF REPORTER                                                Kestopada Bardhan      
	A building materials supplier who had switched allegiance to the Trinamul Congress after being sidelined by the CPM was shot dead at point-blank range in his office on Sunday morning.        
	Kestopada Bardhan, 50, had barely opened his office at 164 Andul Road when three men arrived on a motorcycle, fired three shots and sped off towards Vidyasagar Setu, police said.        
	A bleeding Bardhan was taken to SSKM Hospital but he died within minutes of being admitted.         
	Residents blocked Andul Road in protest against the murder and growing lawlessness in Howrah for four hours, from 8.30am.        
	Bardhan was a former CPM leader who joined Trinamul before the parliamentary poll. But we cannot say for sure that this is a political murder. We have detained one person for interrogation, though there has been no breakthrough so far, said Hari Kishore Kusumarkar, the superintendent of police of Howrah.        
	Bardhan, the owner of a firm named KN Trading, allegedly fell foul of a group within the CPM after bagging a lucrative supply order from the Westbank cancer hospital project barely 300 yards from his office.        
	He was already disliked for opposing the illegal sale of scrap from the closed Guest Keen Williams factory in the neighbourhood, said an aide who did not wish to be identified.        
	Bardhan was the secretary of the No. 3 branch of the Botanic Garden CPM local committee until one-and-a-half years ago.         
	He was replaced after his business interests allegedly clashed with his political obligations. He joined the Trinamul Congress before the parliamentary elections in April-May.        
	Arup Roy, the district secretary of the Trinamul Congress, claimed that Bardhan was killed for leaving the party in protest against rampant corruption.         
	His CPM counterpart, Shreedip Bhattacharya, contested the allegation saying that it was part of the Trinamuls continuing smear campaign against his party.         
	Any killing must be condemned. We want the police to conduct an impartial investigation and bring the culprits to book, he added.        
	The family of the murdered trader hasnt named anyone in the FIR.         
	Bardhans elder brother Gopal said he was clueless about the assailants and their motive.        
	My brother would stand by people in distress and was very popular in the locality. Why would anybody want to kill him? he wondered.        
	Sukumar Bhattacharya, who works in KN Trading, said he was unaware of any threats that his employer might have received.         
	After opening the office, around 8.20am, Dada asked me to call some labourers. I had walked barely 20 yards when I heard gunshots. I rushed back to see Dada covered in blood, he recalled.

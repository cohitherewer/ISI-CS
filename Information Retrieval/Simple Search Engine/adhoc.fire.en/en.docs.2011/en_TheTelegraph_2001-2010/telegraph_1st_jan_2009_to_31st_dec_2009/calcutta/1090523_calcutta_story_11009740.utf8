The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cyber care plan for children 
                                                                                                               Cyber care plan for children 
          A STAFF REPORTER                                                  
	Fifteen-year-old Anita met Rahul on a social networking website. He flooded her with scraps, emails and e-greetings. After online interaction for three months, they came face to face for the first time at a coffee shop. The teenager realised only then that Rahul was married with two children.        
	Protecting children from such unpleasant experiences on the Internet was the focus of an awareness programme recently organised by the city chapter of the Public Relations Society of India (PRSI) and Calcutta Telephones in association with The Telegraph.        
	Only a small percentage of the cyber crimes are currently reported to the cyber crime wing of the detective department. This is because there is not enough awareness on cyber crime. Parents do not know that complaints can be lodged. But the laws are strict and can protect you from cyber criminals, said police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti at the programme.        
	According to Norton Online Living Report 2009, Indian children spend 34 hours online each month and 61 per cent teenagers are members of social networking sites.        
	Children cannot be protected in cyberspace but they can be coached. Parents should do some policing. Children themselves must open up and inform parents if they are facing cyber abuse, said Subir Roy, the state information officer of the National Informatics Centre in Calcutta.        
	GeNext is used to instant access to information but prone to stress and anxiety, feel experts.         
	Six out of every 10 children who come to me are victims of cyber abuse. They are in some way connected to cyber crime, be it stalking, bullying, fraud or gambling, said psychologist Malavika Desai at the event.         
	Many schoolchildren do not know what terrorism is but are acquainted with pornography, she added.        
	The other speakers were Justice S.P. Talukdar, Suparno Moitra, the regional manager of Nasscom, Kalyan Kar, the managing director of Acclaris, Samar Chakraborty of Calcutta Telephones and Debabrata Mukherjee, a former chairman of the PRSI. Jimmy Tangree moderated the discussion.        
	We surf websites out of curiosity. If our questions are answered by our parents, if the TV channel is not changed during an advertisement on sex education, we will be better informed, said Soumyajit, a student, at the forum.        
	Calcutta Police and the PRSI plan to launch a forum in June, where students, teachers, IT professionals and others can share their experience of cyber crime. The cyber crime cell will use the information to devise strategies to fight online crime.        
	Currently, the cyber crime cell can be contacted at 22505120, 22141420 and cybercrimekolkatapolice.gov.in.

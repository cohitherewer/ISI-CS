                                                                                                               Colour code of play, plex amp; party
  - City ready to beat the blues with a feel-good day of revelry          A STAFF REPORTER                          MERRY MENU: Thandai and phuchka shots.   (Sanat Kr Sinha)                                              
	Play by day and party by evening seems to be the festive cocktail of choice to beat the meltdown blues this Holi.        
	The Wednesday menu around town reads something like this: splash bash and merry munch from morning; a rare afternoon siesta; a mall-multiplex date in the evening; capped by chilling out at a nightclub of choice.        
	All city plexes will remain shut in the morning, with a footfall surge on the cards once the curtains go up between 2pm and 6pm. A lot of people like going out in the evening of Holi and the multiplex remains their number one destination. As a result, even the average films should do well, said Virendra Marya, the regional director of INOX.        
	The two Fame plexes are expecting good ticket sales on current booking for Delhi-6 and 13B on Wednesday evening while Cinemax at Mani Square is hoping for a huge turnout for its first Holi in Calcutta.        
	Mall managers share the optimism of the multiplexes with the feel-good factor of Holi expected to boost footfall and sales post-3pm at Forum and post-5pm at South City.        
	We will be playing Holi for four hours at our residential complex, catch a show of Slumdog Millionaire in the evening, and then head for Shisha late at night, said a young businessman staying at Hiland Park.        
	Nightclubs will not serve alcohol from Tuesday midnight till 4pm on Wednesday, but the party will begin much later, with innovative sip n bite like phuchka shots served with white rum being the flavour of the night. Half a day is too short for such a festival, smiles Arvind Bhatnagar of Shisha. For those who like extended fun, Holi nights are meant to be partied away. The Holi hungama involves thematic ambience, thandai, phuchka and remix favourites like Rang barse.        
	For those gearing up to go mad with colours all morning, there is good news from the Met office. The sky on Wednesday is expected to remain cloudy, making the day pleasant, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the weather section at Alipore Met office.                    
	The splash bash at some complexes had already kicked off on Tuesday. Elders and children celebrated Holika Dahan in the evening. A bonfire was lit, said Amrita Priya, a resident of South City complex on Prince Anwar Shah Road. This being our first Holi here, we have all decided to be on the lawns from 10am. And there will be a community lunch, complete with thandai.        
	At Udita in Santoshpur, the colour carnival will be combined with cultural programmes and a community lunch. The fountains will be emptied and filled with coloured water for the kids to have a splash, said resident Mousumi Roy.         
	Some will head for social clubs where there will be music, munch and masti. We are expecting around 400 people. Traditional Holi food like jalebi, puri-aloo and chhole-bature is lined up for lunch, plus thandai and bhaang, said Sanjay Lamba, the president of Calcutta Punjab Club.

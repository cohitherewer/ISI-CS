The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Ragging axe dangles on five JU students
                                                                                                               Ragging axe dangles on five JU students
  - Panel wants action for torture of juniors          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	The anti-ragging committee of Jadavpur University on Wednesday recommended the expulsion of three students of the engineering faculty for ragging five freshers in the main hostel. The panel has also said that one student should be suspended for four semesters and another expelled from the hostel for the same offence.        
	Five first-year students of the engineering faculty had lodged a complaint with JUs anti-ragging squad on September 4 alleging that six seniors had ragged them in the Block A-I hostel.        
	The authorities had set up an anti-ragging committee to conduct a detailed inquiry. The committee submitted its report to vice-chancellor P.N. Ghosh on Wednesday, confirming that the five students had been tortured mentally and physically, and also sexually harassed.        
	The anti-ragging committee has found five students guilty of ragging their juniors. The report will be placed before the executive council on September 22. A final decision on punishing the guilty students will be taken after the members of the council discuss the report, said Ghosh.        
	A senior member of the executive council told Metro that the chances of the council accepting the anti-ragging committees recommendations are high.        
	The ragging case had taken a dramatic turn when two days after the complaint, the five first-year students alleged that the dean of students had forced them to write a false complaint against their seniors. The anti-ragging committee has dismissed the allegation against the dean of students, said a source in JU.        
	A member of the anti-ragging committee told Metro: The report states that five of the accused students had ragged the juniors, who were not only tortured mentally and physically, but also sexually harassed. They were forced to make sexual gestures and to act like a Metro Rail train by crawling under the beds.... Students will have to face punishment if they rag their juniors.        
	On the basis of a directive of the Supreme Court, the University Grants Commission (UGC) has banned ragging in all forms in educational institutions. It has also made it mandatory for all educational institutions to punish students if they are found guilty of ragging their juniors.        
	This is not the first instance of punishment for ragging on campus. The JU authorities had suspended three students of the architecture department and slapped fines on 21 others last year for ragging a first-year girl. The architecture department student had been forced to drink alcohol, smoke marijuana and chew cigarettes.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tech varsity focus on core course
                                                                                                               Tech varsity focus on core course

	The state government is planning to make it mandatory for private engineering colleges to offer at least one course in a core subject, such as mechanical, civil, electrical, mining or metallurgy.        
	The 25-odd groups that have applied for consent to set up engineering colleges this year have been asked to include at least one course in a core subject. The colleges are likely to start functioning in July, said an official in the higher education department.        
	The existing colleges, too, have been asked to upgrade their infrastructure so they can offer at least one course in a conventional subject, the official added.        
	The West Bengal University of Technology, to which all private technical colleges are affiliated, have made a similar announcement. The university wants to encourage students to pursue courses in core subjects, said registrar Rafiqul Islam.        
	We are turning our focus on core subjects not just because the IT sector has become stagnant following the downturn but also because there is an urgent need for capable mechanical, civil and electrical engineers, Islam added.        
	Private engineering colleges that have opened over the past few years, coinciding with the boom in the IT sector, have mostly focussed on information technology.         
	Apart from IT, the only subjects they offer are computer science and engineering and electronic science and communication.        
	Bijoy Guha Mullick, the chairman of the Supreme Knowledge Foundation Group of Institutions, said the gradual rise in the demand for skilled personnel in infrastructure development and manufacturing had led to attractive job offers being made to mechanical, civil and electrical engineers. The demand has prompted us to offer course in a core subject, said Guha Mullick, whose group has opened a college in Mankundu, Hooghly.        
	The college will offer a course in electrical engineering  a core subject  along with three other IT or related subjects, such as computer science and engineering, electronics and instrumentation, and electronics and communication from July.        
	Ever since the state decided to privatise engineering education in the late 1990s, the private institutes have been focussing more on emerging subjects, such as IT.        
	A private college needs to invest Rs 10-15 crore, depending on its location. The cost will rise if we offer courses in core subjects as they require setting up of laboratories and workshops, said the owner of a private technical institute.

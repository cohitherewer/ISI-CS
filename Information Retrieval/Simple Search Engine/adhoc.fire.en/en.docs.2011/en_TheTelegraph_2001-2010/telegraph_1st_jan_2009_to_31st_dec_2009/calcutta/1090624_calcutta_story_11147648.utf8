          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Colleges are facing problems implementing the state governments order to provide academic and financial sops to Aila-affected students. Principals of various colleges told Calcutta University that they could not carry out the order in the absence of guidelines from the government.        
	After the cyclone wreaked havoc in large parts of south Bengal, the government asked colleges through the university to extend the last date of distribution and submission of admission forms for Aila victims.        
	The colleges were also asked to waive admission and tuition fees for the affected students. The waiver, sources said, would be effective for the duration of the course.        
	A large number of students have applied for the sops but we have no clue how to confirm who has really been affected by the storm. There should be specific guidelines from the university, which has forwarded the governments order, on this, said the principal of a college on the southern fringes where a large number of Aila victims are studying.        
	Among the institutions that have approached the university are Sammilani College (Baghajatin), Baruipur College, Patharpratima College, Sagar Mahavidyalaya, Raidighi College and Hingalgunj College.        
	Since there are no guidelines, some colleges are asking students to produce a certificate from the local gram panchayat or MLA to establish that they are genuine victims.        
	I had made it clear the day the announcement was made that students applying for the sops would have to submit a certificate from the local panchayat, said Shantiranjan Pal Chaudhuri, the principal of Sammilani College.        
	CU pro vice-chancellor Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee said: There should not be any problem in the places that were on the path of the storm. As for the colleges that were outside the Aila path, the principals are authorised to use their discretion.

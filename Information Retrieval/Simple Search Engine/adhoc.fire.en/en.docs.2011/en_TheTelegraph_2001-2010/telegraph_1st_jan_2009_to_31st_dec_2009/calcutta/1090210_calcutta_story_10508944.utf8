The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cloud on bus fare slash
                                                                                                               Cloud on bus fare slash
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Bus operators, taking advantage of a loophole in a Road Transport Authority (RTA) rule, might continue to charge the same for tickets despite a fare cut coming into effect on Tuesday.         
	The RTA rule makes it mandatory for bus and minibus operators to collect and display a revised fare chart in their vehicles before charging new fares.        
	The rule was based on the assumption that bus fares would only go up and hence, the bus operators would collect and display the charts in their own interest, thus benefiting passengers.        
	Since the last revision was a ticket-rate reduction after a cut in the price of diesel, most bus operators havent shown any interest in collecting the revised fare chart from the RTA.        
	Barely 1,000 out of the 8,000-odd buses plying in and around the city have collected the new charts. Till they display the new charts they can charge passengers at the old rate. Its unfortunate but true, said Swarnakamal Saha, the president of Bengal Bus Syndicate.         
	Abashesh Daw, the general secretary of the Minibus Coordination Committee, echoed Saha.        
	We have instructed the bus operators to collect the new fare charts at the earliest but it could take a week for the process to be completed. Till then, passengers might have to pay the old fares, said Sadhan Das, the general secretary of the Joint Council of Bus Syndicates.        
	The transport authorities talked tough. The bus operators must collect the revised charts from Tuesday. The RTA rule cannot be used as an excuse. Passengers should not be asked to pay more, said a senior official of the department.        
	Those who travel by bus are in no mood to listen to the operators excuse.         
	The fare from Belgachhia to BBD Bag has been reduced from Rs 6 to Rs 5. There is no way I am going to pay more than Rs 5 from Tuesday, said 58-year-old Dipankar Ghosh, who works in the Reserve Bank of India.

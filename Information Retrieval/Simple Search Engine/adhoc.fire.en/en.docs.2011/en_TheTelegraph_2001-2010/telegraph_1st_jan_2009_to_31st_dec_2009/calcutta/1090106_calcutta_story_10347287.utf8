	Krishna Kundu, who was injured in the minibus accident at Bantala on Sunday night, died on Monday morning at Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals.        
	Hospital sources said the 53-year-old, who had swallowed dirty water from the canal where the bus fell, could not bear the shock of the accident.        
	Kundu was on ventilator. She and 33 others were injured when the driver lost control and the bus landed in the roadside ditch while returning from a picnic in Gosaba in the Sunderbans. The injured were released after treatment.        
	The bus driver has not been arrested yet. We are waiting for a report on the condition of the vehicle which has been impounded. We are also trying to find out whether the driver was drunk, said Ajey Ranade, the superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas.

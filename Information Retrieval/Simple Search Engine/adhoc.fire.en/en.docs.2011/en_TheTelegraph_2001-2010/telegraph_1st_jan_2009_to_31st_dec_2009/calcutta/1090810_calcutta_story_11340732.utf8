The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Swine flu scare triggers panic
                                                                                                               Swine flu scare triggers panic
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	More than double the usual number of patients, suffering mostly from respiratory tract infections common during this time of the year, turned up at the Infectious Diseases Hospital on Sunday morning fearing they had contracted swine flu.        
	People are unnecessarily panicking. Even those with a minor infection in the respiratory tract and with no history of foreign travel or contact with people who had gone abroad recently want to get tested for swine flu, said Banani Mondal, a doctor in the emergency ward of the hospital.        
	Mondal and two more junior doctors examined around 60 patients who had come on their own for swine flu tests. Not one had any swine flu symptom, Mondal said.         
	Doctors said most patients had come after being wrongly informed about the symptoms of the disease. Among those who queued up were Birati resident Devaki Das, 45, who complained of fever and neck pain, and Swarup Dutta from Paikpara, who had been suffering from indigestion and running a mild temperature.         
	Also in the queue was seven-year-old Rohit Shaw from Dum Dum, whose father brought him to the hospital because he had a mild fever and coughed a couple of times on Saturday evening. A doctor prescribed a pill for fever and asked the father to bring him back if the fever did not subside within two days.         
	On an average 30 patients turn up in the emergency department of the hospital on Sundays. But this Sunday was an exception, with doctors examining more than 60 people by noon. There was a rush in the morning. Relatives of some patients turned impatient and exchanged blows among themselves, said a doctor.         
	The relatives complained of lack of coordination in the department. A youth who did not want to be named said: My mother and brother, who have caught a cold, were in a queue which was moving slowly for over an hour. Suddenly everyone was asked to go to a different counter. My mother and brother found themselves at the rear end of the new queue. When they complained, the doctors said maintaining the queue was not their responsibility.         
	The situation is likely to improve from Tuesday after a dedicated swine flu OPD starts functioning in the Beleghata hospital and special clinics to screen flu suspects open at RG Kar and NRS hospitals.        
	Positive: Rishav Bopanna, in his mid-20s, tested positive for swine flu on Sunday. Bopanna was admitted to the hospital on Saturday on his return from the US. A 29-year-old Bangladeshi, Abu Jaffer Mohammad Saleh, was admitted on Sunday.

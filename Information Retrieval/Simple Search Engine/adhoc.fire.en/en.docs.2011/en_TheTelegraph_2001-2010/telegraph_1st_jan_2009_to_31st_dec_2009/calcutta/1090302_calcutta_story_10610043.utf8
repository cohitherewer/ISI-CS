The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Teen assault by hooch gang
                                                                                                               Teen assault by hooch gang
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Chiranjit Sinha recuperates at home. (Gopal Senapati)                                  
	A Higher Secondary examinee and his father were beaten up on Saturday night allegedly for protesting against hooch trade in their Liluah neighbourhood.        
	Chiranjit Sinha, 17, who had been hit on the forehead with a bonti, needed four stitches.        
	More than a hundred residents ransacked a hooch den on Saturday night and blocked Benaras Road the next morning demanding the arrest of the attackers and the other hooch traders.        
	The blockade was lifted after senior police officers arrived at the site and assured the protesters of action. We have arrested a woman and are looking for others associated with the trade, said an officer of Liluah police station.        
	The residents said they had started a campaign against the sale of spurious liquor following the recent hooch deaths in the port area. The residents had forcibly closed down three hooch dens, of which one was opened secretly a few weeks ago.        
	Chiranjits father Biswajit has been in the forefront of the anti-hooch campaign and the boy himself was in one of the groups that used to patrol the locality to ensure the dens did not reopen.        
	Around 8.30pm on Saturday, six or seven people armed with iron rods, sticks and a bonti barged into the Sinhas house and started assaulting Biswajit. When Chiranjit tried to come to his fathers rescue, a member of the hooch gang hit him on the forehead.        
	Chiranjit said: I was studying for the HS exam, scheduled to start in mid-March, when I heard a heated exchange in the next room. On entering the room I saw some people beating up my father. When I tried to rescue him, they hit me on the forehead with a bonti. I was bleeding profusely.         
	Chiranjit was taken to Howrah district hospital. The boys uncle Khokon Singha, too, was assaulted.        
	The residents alleged they had to file a general diary against three men as officers of Liluah police station had refused to register an FIR.

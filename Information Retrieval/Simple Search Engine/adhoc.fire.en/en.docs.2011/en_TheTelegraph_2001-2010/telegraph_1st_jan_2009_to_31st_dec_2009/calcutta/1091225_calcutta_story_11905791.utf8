	Police will intensify vigil in parts of central Calcutta that are thronged by revellers during the festive week that begins on Friday. Cops will particularly focus on isolated, dark spots on the Maidan where youngsters gather for a breather from crowded party zones on Park Street and Shakespeare Sarani.         
	Apart from special arrangements in the Park Street area, where most people assemble to celebrate New Years Eve, security will be stepped up on the Maidan, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters).        
	Youngsters often visit the Maidan area to drink with friends.This may lead to trouble. They may also be targeted by snatchers, said an officer of Maidan police station.         
	He added that police vehicles would patrol the city to check drink driving. Police teams will also be out on the roads on bicycles and on foot, the officer said.        
	Sources said the policemen would be equipped with dragon lights  a powerful search light. If we find people sitting or roaming on the greens, they will be questioned, said another officer.        
	Police vehicles will also patrol the Park Circus-Bypass connector and the Bypass to curb speeding. A number of accidents take place on these stretches every year because people set out on a joy ride after partying. We will chase and intercept speeding vehicles and take action against the offenders, said an officer of the traffic department.

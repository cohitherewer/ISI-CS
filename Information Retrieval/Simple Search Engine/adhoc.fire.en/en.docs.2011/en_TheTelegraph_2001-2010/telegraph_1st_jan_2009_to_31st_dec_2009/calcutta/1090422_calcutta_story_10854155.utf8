The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bypass railing plan
                                                                                                               Bypass railing plan
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The traffic police top brass have asked the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority to install iron railings on the EM Bypass divider between Ruby Hospital and Parama island to prevent mishaps.        
	The landscaped greens currently on the divider do not stop pedestrians from crossing the high-speed corridor wherever they want to, according to the police. Motorists also find it difficult to spot pedestrians standing behind plants and be on guard.        
	There have been three accidents on this stretch  including a fatal one  in the past fortnight.        
	We have written to the CMDA stating that unless iron railings are installed on the EM Bypass the number of accidents will go up, said a senior traffic police officer. The police have also proposed pedestrian barriers around the footpaths on the 3.5km stretch to reduce the number of accidents.        
	A rapid transit bus corridor and a flyover over Parama island are set to come up. We will decide on a traffic re-engineering plan once these are completed, said an official.

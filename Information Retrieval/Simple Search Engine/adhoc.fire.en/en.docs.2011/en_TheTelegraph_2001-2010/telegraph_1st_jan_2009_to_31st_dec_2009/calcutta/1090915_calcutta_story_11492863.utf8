The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Record tech seats vacant
                                                                                                               Record tech seats vacant
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	As many as 2,629 seats in private engineering colleges in the state will remain vacant this year with the state government deciding not to hold a fifth round counselling.        
	This is the first time since private engineering colleges were allowed in the state in the early 1990s that so many seats will remain vacant.        
	Classes of the new session started more than a month ago and the institutions are now conducting class tests. The semester exams will be held after the puja vacation. The colleges should not admit students now, said Sidhartha Dutta, the chairman of the state JEE board.        
	Most of the vacant seats are in computer science, information technology and related subjects that have lost much of their job prospects following the global meltdown.        
	There are more than 25,000 seats in the 85 private engineering colleges across the state, of which 3,081 were vacant after the third round of counselling. But only 452 students took admission in the fourth round.        
	In previous years, not more than two or three counselling sessions were held to fill up the seats.        
	Worried over such a large number of vacancies, the owners of some private colleges requested the government on Monday to allow them to directly admit students who have scored 50 per cent or more in the Class XII exams.        
	There is little chance of accepting the proposal. We are trying to find out a permanent solution to the problem, the official said.        
	D. Banerjee, the director of the Mallabhum Institute of Technology and assistant secretary of the Association of Owners of Private Engineering Colleges, said some institutions would face financial crisis for not getting enough students. The private colleges depend only on tuition fees. In some colleges only five of the 60-odd seats in information technology have been filled up, Banerjee said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Punches for pedestrian on pavement for hawkers
                                                                                                               Punches for pedestrian on pavement for hawkers
          A STAFF REPORTER                           Biswajit Biswas. (Anindya Shankar Ray)                                  
	A pedestrian walking down a crowded central Calcutta pavement overrun by hawkers was punched and kicked by some of them after his foot touched an item of clothing in one of the makeshift shops.        
	Biswajit Biswas, his lips bleeding and pride bruised, walked to Hare Street police station around 5.30pm on Wednesday and filed a complaint about unprovoked assault by hawkers of Bentinck Street.        
	Police arrested two hawkers  Aftab Khan and Anuj Kamat, both in their mid-30s  after taking Biswajit back to the spot to identify the culprits.         
	They had said that pavements were for hawkers, not pedestrians. They are a law unto themselves but I am not one to take such things lying down, the 41-year-old employee of a private company later told Metro.        
	The incident had occurred around 5pm on the pavement that leads to Lalbazar from the intersection of Bentinck Street and Ganesh Chandra Avenue.         
	It was drizzling and many pedestrians, including me, were trying to shield ourselves from the rain by walking under the extended roofs of the shops lining the street. I did not even realise that my foot had touched something on the way, recalled Biswajit.        
	He had barely walked 10 steps when a hawker grabbed him by the collar of his T-shirt and accused him of dirtying a vest kept on a tarpaulin sheet along with other innerwear items.        
	The hawker demanded that Biswajit apologise and pay for the vest. When I told him that such incidents were bound to happen if he kept items on an already narrow pavement, the hawker abused me and said I wouldnt be able to leave the area without paying him for the damage, said the resident of Belgachhia, who often takes the route.        
	As Biswajit tried to free himself, the hawker punched him in the face. The owners of some of the other tarpaulin-covered pavement shops soon joined him in assaulting the pedestrian.        
	When Biswajit slumped to the ground and screamed for help, other pedestrians stopped to look but did not dare challenge the hawkers.         
	A few passers-by did, however, help him back on his feet and offered to be witnesses if he filed a police complaint.         
	Sukumar Mitra, the officer-in-charge of Hare Street police station, said the arrested hawkers had been charged with assault. He wouldnt say whether the probe would also take into account the fact that they were unlawfully occupying the pavement, like hawkers on several thoroughfares.

  - Transfusion gives girl hepatitis amp; HIV        SANJAY MANDAL                                                  
	A thalassaemic teenager who contracted hepatitis C during blood transfusion three years ago had barely won the battle against the potentially fatal liver disease when another callous source of her lifeblood gave her HIV.        
	Shipra Ghosh (name changed on request), 13, was found to be HIV-positive during a routine blood test before a surgery at a private hospital a few weeks ago.         
	The girl has not been told about her condition. She has been through so much pain but not lost her zest for life. I cant inflict more agony on her.... Why my daughter? sobbed her father.        
	Shipra requires blood transfusion more than once a month.         
	According to her father, a government blood bank is the first choice but there have been several occasions when he has had to procure blood from various sources, including private banks.        
	How do I know which bank supplied HIV-infected blood? If it were in our hands, we would not have given her a single transfusion. But she needs it to survive. The cruel irony is that transfusion has endangered her life even more, he lamented.        
	Officials of Central Blood Bank said they were sure that the HIV-infected blood given to Shipra was not supplied from their storage labs.         
	 We follow guidelines provided by NACO (National AIDS Control Organisation) on blood safety by the book. All our blood-test kits are procured from the State AIDS Prevention Commission at Swastha Bhavan, said Ratan Lal Ganguly, the director of the blood bank.        
	Barun Banerjee, a consultant haemato-oncologist at Mission of Mercy Hospital on Park Street, said it was next to impossible to identify the blood bank responsible for Shipras plight.         
	In cases where multiple units of blood are procured from various banks, it is just not possible to pinpoint where the contaminated blood came from, said Banerjee.        
	Blood banks are supposed to screen every unit of donated blood for HIV and hepatitis B and C, and notify the donor if the sample is found positive for any of these viruses.         
	Many blood banks allegedly flout this rule. Sometimes, the testing procedures are faulty.        
	Shipras shattered parents are being counselled not to express their grief in front of their daughter, but neither of them is able to hold back the tears when they see her.        
	Her father said: Much as I want to wish it away, the thought that our only child has not one but two serious diseases is omnipresent. Doctors have told us that researchers across the world are trying to develop medicines to cure HIV/AIDS. My only question is: will that happen in my daughters lifetime?         
	Shipras parents are also worried about the reaction of their neighbours and relatives if they were to know that the teenager has tested HIV-positive.        
	People still treat HIV/AIDS as a disease that only immoral people suffer from. I wont be able to bear it if someone so much as points a finger at my daughter, Shipras father said.        
	The teenager was diagnosed with thalassaemia when she was a child. For the first few years, one transfusion a month would keep her reasonably healthy. But as she grew up, her condition deteriorated.         
	When Shipra contracted hepatitis C, her condition had become so critical that we thought she would not survive, her father said.        
	But Shipra is a fighter and her family is praying that she remains that way.

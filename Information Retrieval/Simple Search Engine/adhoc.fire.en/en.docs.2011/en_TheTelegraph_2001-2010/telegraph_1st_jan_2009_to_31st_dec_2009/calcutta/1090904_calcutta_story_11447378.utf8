The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Uneasy truce in mall row
                                                                                                               Uneasy truce in mall row
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          The Pantaloons store in South City being opened after the shutdown on Wednesday. (Anindya Shankar Ray)                                  
	Method returned to South City Mall after the shutdown madness on Wednesday, which stumped Puja shoppers and brought the mall-versus-retailer melee to a flashpoint.        
	Although both the warring parties  Pantaloons and the South City management  buried the hatchet on Wednesday evening, such flare-ups are waiting to happen, going by the aggressive stance taken by most players on either side of this great divide.        
	The pendulum has swung far too much to the retailers side and they have started holding the mall developers to ransom. Its grossly unfair for a retailer to shift common area maintenance or services costs to the mall management, said Sanjay Jhunjhunwalla, whose Mani Group built Mani Square.        
	The strongest retailers lobby was stitched together at Mani Square a few months back when a clutch of stores, bleeding from poor footfalls, came together to demand a rollback in rentals.        
	For any new mall, theres always an initial courtship period when they need the brands, and this wooing normally continues till they achieve 50 per cent occupancy. Once that critical mass is reached, they sing a very different tune, alleged Vijay Dugar of CS Trade Link, who runs stores in Mani Square and South City.        
	Who benefits from this stand-off? No one, since the malls need the brands as much as the brands need the retail rendezvous. Under the circumstances, all stakeholders should co-operate, not compete, Kishore Biyani, the founder and CEO of Future Group, had said at a recent retail summit in Mumbai.        
	Biyanis Pantaloons outlet was in the eye of the South City storm, downing shutters after the mall management had snapped air-conditioning connection, citing non-payment of dues that added up to over Rs 1 crore. We will wait 10 days for them to clear their dues, but our patience is running out, Sushil Mohta of South City Projects said on Thursday.        
	The truce, brokered by B.S. Nagesh of Shoppers Stop, need not be a fragile one if theres greater handholding on the part of the developers, felt Kamal Jain, who franchises Adidas and Benetton in town.        
	Jain is categorical that rent more than Rs 80-90 (per sq ft per month) is not sustainable, given the current context. The best-case scenario is of course revenue sharing, which has happened in some cases. But if the developer is reasonable with rentals like in City Centre New Town, we can all survive and grow together, he said.        
	Rentals are touching Rs 300 for some outlets in the Courtyard annexe, while Mani Square and South City have also demanded crazy rates, complain retailers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fall from balcony kills blind woman
                                                                                                               Fall from balcony kills blind woman
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 50-year-old blind widow died after falling from the balcony outside her flat on the top floor of a six-storeyed house in Posta on Friday afternoon.        
	Munni Devi was alone in the flat when the mishap occurred. Her three sons, all in their 20s, had gone out for work.         
	They used to lock the front gate before leaving home so that their mother, who was also suffering from mental ailments, could not step out alone. On Friday, the door wasnt locked.        
	Munni Devi, who had lost her eyesight a couple of decades back, had wandered to the balcony thinking it was the toilet, said a neighbour. She stumbled over the railing, barely 2.5-feet high, and fell on Maharshi Debendra Road.        
	Pedestrians rushed her to Bishudhananda Hospital, where she was declared dead on arrival.        
	A police team inspected the flat in the evening and spoke to neighbours and residents.        
	We have not found any evidence of foul play. Munni Devi was suffering from mental disorders over the past few months and was on medication, said an investigator.        
	Nitish Agarwal, who lives on the fourth floor of the building, said the three sons used to leave for work between 9am and 11am and returned in the evening.         
	Munni Devi used to do household work like cooking despite being blind, he said.        
	Last month she had lost her way while returning from a relatives place and was found wandering on the road, added an officer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Downturn toll on Joka jobs
                                                                                                               Downturn toll on Joka jobs
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The 2009 batch of Joka has crossed the Rs 1-crore mark this placement season but that has failed to lift the spirits at the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta, which has been reeling from the global downturn.        
	An official said the number of offers made by companies this year was significantly lower compared with the last.        
	Of the 265 students, 207 got offers from 74 firms in the first phase of the placement that continued from February 21 to 24. Of these, 56 are pre-placement offers (PPOs) based on summer internship. The Rs 1-crore offers were made to more than a couple of students.        
	An official said that last year, 243 PPOs and lateral placement offers were made even before the final placement started.        
	Many international firms, affected by the downturn, had reduced the number of offers. A few students, too, rejected lucrative international offers and opted for more secure jobs, said Paul Savio, the external relations cell secretary of the Joka institute.        
	Thirty-three offers are for international locations spread across the US, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. Some students rejected PPOs fearing a curb on H1B visas and also because they did not want to shift to the US during downturn.        
	Students who have rejected offers and the companies concerned are negotiating the locations, said Savio.        
	The students are also concerned about the pay packages. Most companies have offered compensation similar to that of last year, with the students fearing even lower pay packets in the subsequent rounds of placement.        
	The Rs 1-crore offers, they said, might remain only on paper. All investment banks have a large variable component, which depends on their performance, as part of the package. Performance is bound to take a beating, given the financial situation, resulting in a lower pay, said a student.        
	Slot Zero saw offers from McKinsey, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley.

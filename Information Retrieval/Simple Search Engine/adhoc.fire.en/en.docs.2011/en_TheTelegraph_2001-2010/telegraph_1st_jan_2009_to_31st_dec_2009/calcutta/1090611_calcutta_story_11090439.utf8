                      Belated tribute to forgotten heroes                    As part of Natyanjali, the on-going theatre festival hosted by Sangeet Natak Akademi in collaboration with EZCC, theatre-lovers will be treated to Pahatia, a play from Chhattisgarh, this evening. The play opens with a narration by Pahatia, a cowherd in a small hamlet who loves to enact and dramatically present stories or incidents from myths, folklore, history and even contemporary events. In the process, Pahatia helps create awareness among the rural masses about their rights and their sacrifices. He begins his narration with the portrayal of Gaind Singh, the landlord of Paralkot, who led his people to revolt against British tyranny in 1824-25. He was captured and hanged. He then continues his tales of heroism by enacting the role of Veer Narayan Singh, the landlord of Sonakhan who continued the incomplete task of Gaind Singh, only to be hanged in 1857. Hanuman Singh, a former sepoy in the British Army, took the mantle from Veer Narayan Singh and met his predecessors fate. Finally, Pahatia enacts the role of Gundadhar, leader of the Bhumal movement for the rights of the people of Bastar. The play is actually a tribute to these legendary figures of Chhattisgarh who mobilised the masses against the British and sacrificed their lives for a noble cause, but whose names figure nowhere in the annals of history. Directed by Dr Yogendra Choubey, the play is presented by Gudi Sanskritik Evam Samajik Sansthan, Raigarh.

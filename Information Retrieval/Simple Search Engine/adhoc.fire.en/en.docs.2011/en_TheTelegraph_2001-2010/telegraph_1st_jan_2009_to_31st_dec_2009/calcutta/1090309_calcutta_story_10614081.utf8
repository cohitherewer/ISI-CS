The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | The mark of dirty politics
                                                                                                               The mark of dirty politics
                              Poll graffiti being painted at Moulali                             
	Political parties of all hues have laid siege to private walls violating the election commission guidelines. Scores of readers have written to Metro to protest the defacement. Heres a sample of the emails:                    
	I certainly do not want my walls to be defaced. But at the same time, I do not want to be erased from the face of this earth by the hoodlums of the political parties.

	For more than 20 years nobody had defaced the boundary wall of our house in Shibpur, Howrah, save for a small scribble in a corner or a poster or two. Last November, just before the Howrah civic elections, I woke up one day to find the whole wall covered with Trinamul slogans. I wrote to the state chief election officer, district election officer and the district magistrate.         
	Within days, the superintendent of police (Howrah) assured me of strict action. Meanwhile, the Left Front and Congress candidates had filled up the few clean patches on the wall. As the police had surely informed the parties of my complaint, a garbage vat was erected next to the wall the evening the results were announced. Since then I have been sending reminders to the three officials but to no avail.

	Give permission for wall graffiti? Youve got to be kidding.         
	Sunrit Mullick         
	Salt Lake can never be the role model for Calcutta in the wall graffiti war. Quite a few walls in Salt Lake are defaced by political parties. Unlike the city, the township has long walls, ideal for painting graffiti.        
	A.S.Mehta               
	Who cares for my approval before damaging my neatly painted boundary wall? Stick no bill is written in large fonts outside my house but political parties have paid no heed to this request. We are helpless in the face of political muscle flexing. The election commission is autonomous only in name. It has allowed the parties to do as they please on our walls.         
	Subhankar Mukherjee               
	Fewer walls are defaced in Salt Lake because residents stand up united against the political parties. Calcuttans must do the same to protect their walls.         
	Umang Sharma               
	Political slogans look horrible on the wall. Even house-owners who support political parties would not want their walls to be defaced. However, few would muster the courage to stop supporters of the parties. More power to the poll panel and restraint by the parties is the only solution.        
	PB Saha              
	Salt Lake can be a role model for the city when it comes to cleanliness of walls. It is, however, true that politicians exert less pressure on Salt Lake house-owners, who are more diligent than Calcuttans in protecting their walls.        
	Amrita Mallik               
	Its a matter of shame that private walls are defaced by politicians. Dont they care about the impression the city gives to outsiders?

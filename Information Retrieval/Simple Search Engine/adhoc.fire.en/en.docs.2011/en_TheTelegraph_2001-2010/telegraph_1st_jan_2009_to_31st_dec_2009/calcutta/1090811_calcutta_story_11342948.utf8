                      The joy of creativity                    The Leela theory of creation found in Sanskrit aesthetic texts is similar to the Western Play theory of creativity. Both theories assume that the prime motive force of artistic creation is the joy derived by the artist while creating his work of art. The work, thus playfully created, exhibits in itself the absolute delight and joy that went into its creation. The works of veteran artists Kartick Chandra Pyne and Partha Pratim Deb, on display at Leela, the ongoing show of their paintings, evoke such response in viewers minds. On beholding their works, they can experience the joy that the artists derived from their play with materials, techniques, ideas, images and imagery. But as independent artists from different backgrounds, they deal with totally different concerns and interests. Nevertheless, both artists showcase the diversity of their individual commitments within the ambit of an unified idea about artistic creation. Curated by Pranabranjan Ray.

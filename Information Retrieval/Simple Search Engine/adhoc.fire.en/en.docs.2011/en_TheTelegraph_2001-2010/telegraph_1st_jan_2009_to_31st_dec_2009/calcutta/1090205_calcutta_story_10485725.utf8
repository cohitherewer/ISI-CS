The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | State sticks to fare chart
                                                                                                               State sticks to fare chart
  - Bus-minibus operators cry betrayal, mull strike          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Minister Subhas Chakraborty on Wednesday defied the transport lobby and stuck to the revised fares the government had announced last week.        
	The fares announced last Friday would come into effect from February 10, Chakraborty asserted at Writers Buildings, while bus and minibus operators expressed their shock at the ministers betrayal of trust and held out a veiled threat to go on strike.        
	The situation can be reviewed in April if the operators face any problem with the new fares, the minister added.        
	But that was not enough to pacify the transporters. The minister did a U-turn after agreeing to meet our demands on Tuesday. He shouldnt complain if we go on strike now, said Sadhan Das, the general secretary of the Joint Council of Bus Syndicates.        
	The revised bus fares are Rs 4 for the first 4km, Rs 5 for 4-8km, Rs 5.5 for 8-12km, Rs 6 for 12-16km, Rs 7 for 16-20km and a hike of 50 paise for every 4km thereafter. The new minibus fares are Rs 5 for the first 2km, Rs 5.5 for 2-6km and Rs 6 for 6-10km.        
	Taxis will charge Rs 20 for the initial two 2km and Rs 2 for every 200 metres thereafter. The waiting charge will be Re 1 for 2 minutes and 12 seconds.        
	Following the recent reduction in sales tax on diesel by 29 paise, the government decided to slash fares for buses, minibuses and taxis. With transport operators protesting the unilateral cut, the minister decided to meet them on Wednesday.        
	Chakraborty managed to persuade taxi operators to accept the revised fares but the bus-minibus lobby stuck to its stand, demanding modifications to what the government had suggested.        
	Bus operators had urged Chakraborty not to fix the fare in 50paise denomination as the Reserve Bank of India charges a 30 per cent fee for bulk procurement of the coins. The bank does not charge the fee on 50paise coins for state-owned buses. We will urge the bank to extend the same benefit to private buses, Chakraborty said.        
	The ministers stand comes as a surprise as the government has a history of bowing to pressures from transporters, a key constituency of the CPM. Each time the government revised the fares in the recent past, the transport lobby had its way.        
	The government had little choice this time as the general elections are round the corner. Giving in to the demand of a handful of operators would have antagonised a large chunk of voters, said an official.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Trinamul drives auto protest
                                                                                                               Trinamul drives auto protest

	The day-old auto united front of the political parties fell apart on Friday as the police force flagged off a tentative crackdown on two-stroke autos and Trinamul Congress slipped into the drivers seat of the protest movement against the ban.        
	As protests against police crackdown on the banned autos raced from Taratala to Pratapaditya Road, the Trinamul top brass hit the streets with Mamata Banerjee leading from the front. We cannot tolerate police atrocities against auto operators. Our party will stand by them, said Mamata trying to divert attention from the courts order banning two-stroke autos from January 1 to its implementation on January 2.        
	She also seized the spotlight by taking her protest to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees doorstep on Palm Avenue late on Friday and unleashing a fresh attack on the CPM ahead of the Parliament polls.              
	In a bid to usurp the auto ban issue, Trinamul was quick to call a 12-hour auto and taxi strike on Saturday. Citu distanced itself from the strike call, from 6am to 6pm.        
	Whatever she (Mamata) is saying and doing is nothing but an attempt to create anarchy in the state, said Biman Bose, the CPM state secretary.         
	Estimates suggest that the city has around 70,000 registered and unregistered autos, traditionally a Citu constituency. With the police out to enforce the two-stroke ban and Citu trying to strike a balance between environmental and political concerns, Trinamul has revved up protests.        
	We are gaining in strength every day. Earlier, we had members in 20 out of the 123 auto routes in and around the city. But at present, workers on 80 routes have joined us and we have around 35,000 supporters, said Sovandeb Chattopadhyay, a Trinamul Congress MLA and leader of Auto Bachao Committee.         
	According to Trinamul sources, the party was expecting a flare-up over the issue and was ready to hit Citu where it hurts. Chatterjee held around 50 meetings with auto operators in the past month to convince them to switch loyalties to the Trinamul-steered Auto Bachao Committee. Citu state secretary Kali Ghosh, however, said only the autos without any valid papers have joined the Trinamul ranks. Those who run their autos without any valid registration can never be our members, said Ghosh, putting the number at 5 to 10 per cent of the total fleet.        
	But unofficial estimates of the environment department have put the number of unregistered autos at 30,000, around 40 per cent of the total fleet.        
	Trinamul is trying to fish in troubled waters for political reasons. It is not concerned about the auto workers, said Subhas Mukherjee, the joint secretary of the Citu-affiliated Road Transport Workers Federation.

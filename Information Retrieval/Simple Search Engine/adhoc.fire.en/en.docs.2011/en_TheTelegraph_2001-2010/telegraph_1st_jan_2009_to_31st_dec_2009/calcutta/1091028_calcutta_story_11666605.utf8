	A Baranagar resident and two other tourists died and eight, including at least five Calcuttans, were injured when the car they were travelling in fell into a 200ft deep ravine in North Sikkim on Tuesday morning.         
	Nanda Ghosh, the woman in her mid-40s who was killed in the mishap, was part of a group of tourists from Baranagar. Her husband Gautam Ghosh and neighbours Shyamal and Mamata Pal and Mithun and Bonosree Manas were injured.        
	They reached North Sikkim District Hospital around 6.30pm, said an official of a travel agents association. Members of the Ghosh and Pal family have left for Sikkim.        
	The tourists were on their way from Yumthang to Yumesamdong when, according to the subdivisional magistrate, a boulder fell on the car, tossing it into the ravine. Shyamal Pal, however, said the car fell while negotiating a bend.         
	Debashis Basak and Tapas Roy Basak from Sainthia in Birbhum were the other two killed in the mishap.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sudden halt inside tunnel
                                                                                                               Sudden halt inside tunnel
  - Metro train develops snag, passengers evacuated          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Around 1,500 passengers of Metro Railway got stuck inside a Tollygunge-bound train when it came to an abrupt halt while pulling out of Esplanade station at 6.13pm on Thursday.        
	The driving motor of the train ceased to function because of a glitch, causing the train to stop abruptly, a Metro official said.        
	All but one coach had entered the tunnel on the way to Park Street station when the train stopped.        
	After trying for 10 minutes to repair the glitch, officials evacuated the passengers through the rear exit of the last compartment.        
	The passengers started to panic when the train stopped suddenly. Announcements were made over the trains public address system to explain the situation to them, said an official.        
	When the glitch could not be fixed in 10 minutes, we decided to evacuate the passengers. Announcements were made to assure the passengers that our officials would help them disembark on the platform at Esplanade station through the rear exit, he added.        
	No one was injured in the incident, which raised curiosity among passengers waiting on the platform for another train.        
	Mechanics and engineers rectified the problem partially and at 6.50pm, the empty train was taken to the Tollygunge shed.        
	As a result of the snag, five Tollygunge-bound trains were detained at various stations between Dum Dum and Esplanade and services on the line were disrupted for about 35 minutes.        
	Metro officials said an investigation was on to ascertain the cause of the fault.         
	This train will not be operated till the problem is diagnosed and rectified, an official said.         
	A team of engineers will conduct the probe and make the necessary repairs.        
	Once the glitch is fixed, the team will test the train by running it several times, without passengers.         
	Till then the train will remain in the shed.

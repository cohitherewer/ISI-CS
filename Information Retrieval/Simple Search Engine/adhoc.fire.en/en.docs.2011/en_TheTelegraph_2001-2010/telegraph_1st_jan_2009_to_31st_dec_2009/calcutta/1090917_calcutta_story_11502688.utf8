The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CU signals switch to grades
                                                                                                               CU signals switch to grades
  - Semester system in varsity postgraduate studies          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Grades and semester tests will soon replace marks and annual exams in all postgraduate courses of Calcutta University (CU).        
	Semester exams will replace the annual Part I and Part II examinations in the postgraduate courses in all the faculties. We will also start awarding grades instead of marks to students, said Suranjan Das, the vice-chancellor of CU.        
	He was speaking at a programme to award gold medals to students who stood first in the universitys postgraduate examinations between 1984 and 1996 and in 2007.         
	A couple of years ago, the Union ministry of human resource development and the University Grants Commission (UGC) announced a policy of replacing annual exams and marks with the semester system and grades. Universities across the country were urged to switch to the more student-friendly system.        
	The Part I and Part II examinations in the postgraduate courses offered by CU in science and technology have been replaced by semester examinations over the past few years.        
	We are preparing to introduce grades in the postgraduate exams of the science and technology faculties from 2010. But before a decision is taken, the issue will be discussed by the science and technology faculty councils, said Das.        
	The faculty councils will decide whether the students are going to be awarded only grades or both grades and marks. Restructuring of questions, necessary for introduction of grades, will also be discussed.         
	In the arts and social sciences faculties, semester exams have been introduced in the Bengali MA course.         
	According to Das, the arts and commerce departments have restructured the teaching pattern to suit the semester system.        
	Colleges affiliated to the university and offering postgraduate courses will be allowed to decide whether they would continue with the existing system or switch to semesters and grades.        
	The vice-chancellor said a proposal to gradually abolish the Part I, Part II and Part III exams at the undergraduate level is also being considered by the university.        
	We will take time to introduce semester exams and grades at the undergraduate level since more than three lakh students write the BA, BSc and BCom examinations every year, said the vice-chancellor.

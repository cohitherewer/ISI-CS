                                                                                                               Bail after twist in Belur kidnap tale
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The four persons arrested on Monday for allegedly abducting Howrah schoolboys Raju Shaw and Satyajit Chatterjee were granted bail by the chief judicial magistrates (CJM) court in Howrah after the two denied they were kidnapped.         
	Appearing in court on Tuesday afternoon, Raju and Satyajit  students of Ghusuri Uchha Madhyamik Vidyalaya  said they had voluntarily accompanied the four men in their car.        
	Subrata Chaudhury, the owner of travel agency Chaudhury Rangers and three of his employees  Bankim Ghosh, Barun Mukherjee and Amar Ghosh  were arrested near Raja Peary Mohan College in Uttarpara.        
	The four men were arrested under IPC sections 363 and 366 after Subhash Pal, a teacher in the boys school, alerted Bally police station. As the teacher claimed to be a witness, we started a case of abduction, said a police officer.        
	In his complaint, Pal had said that Raju and Satyajit were forcibly huddled into a cherry red Maruti van from near Belur Math.        
	The cops intercepted the van in Uttarpara and the boys were rescued. Initially, the boys had told the police that they had been abducted by the four men.        
	But following the statement of the two boys and their family members, the court on Tuesday granted bail to all the accused against bonds of Rs 2,000 each.        
	During interrogation, Chaudhury told us that Satyajit took Rs 2,600 from him as loan on Saturday after joining his travel agency as a bus drivers help. But as he did not join work and did not return the money, Chaudhury said he wanted to teach the boy a lesson, said the officer.        
	But on Tuesday the boys gave a clean chit to Chaudhury and his associates.        
	Raju and Satyajit told the magistrate that they were waiting near the Belur bus stand when a red Maruti van was passing by and they requested the driver to give them a lift to Uttarpara, said Samir Kumar Dey, the public prosecutor.         
	Rajus father Shibnarayan Shaw and Satyajits father Manik Chatterjee also gave in writing to the police that they did not have any complaints against the four.

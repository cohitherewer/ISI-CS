The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Few takers for IPL tours
                                                                                                               Few takers for IPL tours
          A STAFF REPORTER                           John Buchanan was the star attraction at a match between the Kolkata Knight Riders support staff and CC amp;FC at the club on Sunday morning. The cricket manager of the Knights, however, scored only 1 and his team was trounced by 95 runs. Picture by Amit Datta                                  
	Indian Premier League tour packages in South Africa have not found many takers in the home of the Kolkata Knight Riders.         
	Calcuttans comprise 8 to 10 per cent of Indians who travel abroad to catch Team India in action. The figure is likely to drop for IPL because of the downturn, limited air links and expensive accommodation, said travel industry sources.        
	We are offering a package of Rs 1.25 lakh per person per week on a twin-sharing basis. The cost will include return airfare, transportation between the hotel and airport, accommodation and breakfast, said Anil Punjabi, the chairman (east) of the Travel Agents Federation of India. Match tickets, lunch and dinner will cost extra.        
	Other tour operators are offering similar packages by tying up with airlines and three-star hotels in the eight match venues  Kimberley, Bloemfontein, East London, Cape Town, Johannesburg, Durban, Pretoria and Port Elizabeth.        
	As of now, there are very few takers for the packages, said Punjabi.         
	Kenya Airways, which flies to Johannesburg from Mumbai through Nairobi, is still bullish on city fans.        
	We expect group travellers from Calcutta. Special fares are being offered in April for the IPL, said Ruby Virmani of Kenya Airways.         
	The lowest return fare on the airline from Calcutta will be around Rs 35,000 with a stopover at Nairobi.         
	Sanjay Lamba and his friends who were regulars at both the home and away matches of the Kolkata Knight Riders last year will, however, watch the matches on the small screen.        
	It is impossible to travel half the globe to watch the matches. I cannot afford to be stranded in South Africa for more than a month and it does not make any sense to spend so much on IPL, said Lamba, the president of Calcutta Punjab Club.

                                                                                                               Fire guts godowns
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Five godowns and a motorcycle service centre in Kidderpore were gutted in a fire that raged for more than seven hours on Tuesday. There was no casualty. Residents of Satya Doctor Road alerted fire services around 6.30am after spotting smoke belching out of the 50,000sq ft shed that houses the godowns and service centre. Firemen said a short-circuit in the motorcycle service centre probably sparked the blaze. The extent of the damage is yet to be ascertained.        
	Meeting moved: State chief secretary Ashok Mohan Chakrabarti on Tuesday was forced to shift his meeting with district magistrates regarding ongoing projects from the South 24-Parganas district headquarters at Alipore to Writers Buildings because of an agitation by the Trinamul Congress.         
	Molest probe: A 36-year-old trainee medical officer accused of molesting a woman at a Beleghata nursing home last month was arrested on Tuesday after police found that his MBBS certificate was fake. The woman had lodged a complaint against Abhijit Mullick, a resident of Domjur in Howrah, after he allegedly molested her during a check-up.        
	Animals shifted: Ten peacocks, 10 turtles, 30 parrots, a giant squirrel and 10 peahen eggs were shifted to the animal rescue centre in Salt Lake from a Chandernagore house on Tuesday, following a high court directive. Goutam Seth, the owner of the house, said his family had applied for a licence in 1997 to keep the animals on their premises.

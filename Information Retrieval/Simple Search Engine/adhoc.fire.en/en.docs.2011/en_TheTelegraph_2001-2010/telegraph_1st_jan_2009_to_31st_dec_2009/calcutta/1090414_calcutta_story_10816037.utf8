The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Traders duped with fake drafts
                                                                                                               Traders duped with fake drafts
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A man in his mid-30s duped five shops in the city last month by producing fake bank drafts and leaving with goods worth over Rs 12 lakh.        
	Police said on Monday that a man identifying himself as Manish Bansal had duped traders in Alipore, Bowbazar and Burrabazar on March 27 and left the city soon after.        
	The stolen items include zinc ingots, copper wires and sanitary wares. The cops have recovered some of the booty from Ludhiana but are clueless about the fraud.        
	The mans visiting card had three mobile numbers and a fax number, which turned out to be that of a fax operator in Bowbazar, said an officer.         
	The cops suspect the man had arrived in Calcutta in mid-March and went around introducing himself as a bulk purchaser of various items. The traders said the man offered to pay by cheques but when they refused to accept them, he said he would pay by draft as he didnt want to carry such a huge amount of cash.        
	On March 27, the man first went to Alipore where he picked up copper wires worth Rs 5 lakh and then to Bowbazar, where he bought sanitary ware worth Rs 3.5 lakh. Finally, he went to Burrabazar to buy zinc ingots worth Rs 4 lakh. All payments were made by drafts purportedly issued by a nationalised bank. When the traders went to the bank on March 29, they realised the drafts were fake.        
	An employee of one of the traders had noted down the registration number of the Matador the man had brought to carry back the goods. The police traced the vehicle and learnt that the man had taken the van to Howrah station.        
	The register of booked items at the station revealed that two huge consignments were booked for Ludhiana in the name of Dilip Gupta.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Twin blows to transport lobby
                                                                                                               Twin blows to transport lobby
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	Transport operators faced a double whammy on Monday with the Supreme Court refusing to give polluting buses and taxis a new lease of life and Calcutta High Court dismissing a petition challenging the decision to junk seized two-stroke autos.         
	The apex court bench of Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan and Justice B.S. Chauhan said the question of staying a high court order to phase out commercial vehicles older than 15 years did not arise at this juncture.         
	That order has already been implemented. Rightly or wrongly, these vehicles are off the road. If we extend the deadline, all these vehicles will start plying againThere will be chaos and confusion, the bench said.         
	But while commercial vehicles older than 15 years cannot legally return for now, the court battle is far from over.         
	The counsel for the transport operators, Kalyan Bandopadhyay, argued that the high court never gave his clients the opportunity to air their views on the state governments notification on phasing out polluting vehicles.         
	We were not party to the PIL (based on which the high court turned the notification into a judicial order on July 18 last year). The high court passed that order without hearing us, he contended.         
	The apex court took cognisance of the complaint and issued notices to the parties named in the petition to convey their views on the phase-out by the next hearing. Green activist Subhash Dutta, who had filed the phase-out petition on behalf of the Howrah Ganatantrik Nagarik Samiti, termed the notice a blessing.         
	Now there is a possibility that the Supreme Court itself will monitor the citys pollution. I will request the apex court to monitor pollution levels in accordance with the report of the Bhure Lal Committee (that anchored Delhis switch to CNG), Dutta said.         
	On whether that meant the phase-out dispute was now out of the high courts jurisdiction  the green bench is scheduled to receive a status report on implementation of its order on August 21  Dutta said it was unlikely that the hearing would be held.         
	Government lawyers said they would most likely be asked to submit the status report to the apex court.         
	Transport operators appeared downcast for the first time since moving the apex court on July 29, two days before the phase-out deadline. We are disappointed. We had hoped that the honourable Supreme Court would sympathise with us and hand us a stay or an extension, said Trinamul leader Swarnakamal Saha, a spokesman for the Banijyik Paribahan Bachao Committee.         
	Tarak Nath Bari, the secretary of the Calcutta Taxi Association, said: The apex court hasnt even given us a date for the next hearing. It seems we are headed for the usual, prolonged legal process.        
	Transport minister-designate Ranjit Kundu played it safe. I have heard about the Supreme Court order. Concern for the environment is understandable and court orders have to be implemented. However, we need to be looking into all related issues.        
	Kundu may have meant looking the other way, going by the lack of police action against transport operators who have defied the ban.         
	There are a few ambiguities in the (original) crackdown order that PVD (public vehicles department) officials have not been able to clarify. As such, there will be no change in our strategy because of the apex courts stand on the topic, said a senior officer of traffic police.         
	No two-stroke auto was seized on Monday, but a single-judge bench of the high court dismissed a petition moved by the Kolkata Autorickshaw Operators Association demanding a stay on the destruction of seized autos. Justice Tapan Sen said: Whatever steps the administration is taking in this regard are right and the court will not intervene in the matter.

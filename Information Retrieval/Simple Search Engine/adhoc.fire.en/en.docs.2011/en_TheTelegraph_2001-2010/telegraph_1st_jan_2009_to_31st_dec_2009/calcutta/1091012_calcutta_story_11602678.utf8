The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cadets, students clean up citys lungs
                                                                                                               Cadets, students clean up citys lungs
          A STAFF REPORTER                                          The Maidan clean-up on Sunday. Pictures by Pabitra Das      
	More than 500 volunteers gathered on the Maidan on Sunday morning for what turned out to be the largest clean-up in the city.        
	Starting 7.30am, cadets from the army and navy as well as green police and civilians, including school and slum children, uprooted bushes and overgrown grass and removed discarded plastic from six acres of the greens opposite Chatterjee International.        
	The Maidan is the citys lungs. Half of it is well-maintained but this part with the pond can be a real beauty if cleaned, said M. Kulshrestha, the commanding officer of No. 1 Bengal Naval Unit NCC.        
	Joining Kulshrestha and his team of navy cadets was Col. H.S. Sirohi, the NCC group commander (Kolkata B) from the army. This corner of the greens should be made reusable on a daily basis. Till that is achieved, the clean-up will continue. The drive is also a run-up to the social services we are planning before NCC Day on November 22, he said.        
	Yellow masks on and shovels in glove-covered hands, the green crusaders tugged at the roots of shrubs and overgrown grass and picked up plastic items, some of which were almost embedded in the soil. The waste was dumped in a heap and then carried out in PWD lorries. We are chopping the bushes that sap the strength of the soil, so the trees can get enough energy, explained a woman cadet at work.        
	Watching the scene from a distance was little Beku, dressed in an oversized white T-shirt and shorts. The five-year-old slum boy, who lives on the Maidan with his family, was so inspired by the green brigade that he brought along his friends and joined in. Why are you doing this? asked a volunteer. The bright-eyed boy replied: I want this to become a park.        
	Also lending a helping hand were 20 students from Khalsa High School who had come with their sports teacher and a few students of MC Kejriwal Vidyapeeth. Many students are from the school hockey and cricket teams. They practise on the Maidan and are happy to do something to keep their playground litter-free, said Gurcharan Singh, the teacher.         
	Next Sunday, the turnout is likely to be bigger. Whats the point in cleaning your house and leaving the rest dirty? We will be back next Sunday, said a Khalsa High School student.

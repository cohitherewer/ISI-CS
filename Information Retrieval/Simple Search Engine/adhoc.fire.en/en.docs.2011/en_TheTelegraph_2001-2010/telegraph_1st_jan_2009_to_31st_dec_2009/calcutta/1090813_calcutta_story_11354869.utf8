The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Twin arrests on terror charge 
                                                                                                               Twin arrests on terror charge 
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Two Aizawl residents who allegedly ran an arms racket and funded Dima Halam Daogah (Jewel faction), a terror outfit operating in Assams North Cachar Hills, were arrested in central Calcutta on Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday morning.         
	The man and woman have been booked under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act and charged with criminal conspiracy.         
	The recently formed National Investigating Agency (NIA) tipped off the city police about the two while probing the flow of funds to terror outfits in Assam.        
	The Special Task Force of the city police arrested the duo and seized Rs 2.3 lakh from them.         
	Malasawmkimi, a 31-year-old woman from Bawngkawn in Aizawl, was arrested in a Sudder Street shop on Tuesday afternoon. George Lal Thang, 31, of Electric Bazar in Aizawl, was held in Tiretta Bazar on Wednesday.         
	The two were produced in a city court. They would be handed over to officers of the NIA, who will take them on transit remand to New Delhi, said Jawed Shamim, the joint police commissioner.        
	Cops claimed the duo reached the city a few days back and put up in separate places before meeting in central Calcutta.         
	The Centre had banned the Dima Halam Daogah (Jewel faction), a Dimasa outfit also known as Black Widow, under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act.        
	The outfit has been fighting for a separate Dimasa state comprising North Cachar Hills, Cachar and Karbi Anglong in Assam and parts of Dimapur in Nagaland.

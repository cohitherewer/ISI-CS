	A.S. Mehta,           
	New Alipore           
	lSocial changes, perceptional and attitudinal, take place silently but steadily. Kudos to Metro for Black destroyer of demons goes true blue, October 19. The shift in peoples choice to the benevolent Shyama Kali (picture right) from Rudra or Shamshan Kali (picture bottom) shows how the image and social connectivity of Hindu gods and goddesses change over time.           
	I remember even in the 1960s, Kali puja was a small affair, mostly performed by ascetics and at crematoriums. People were usually scared of organising a Kali puja as they feared that if any error crept into the rites and rituals, they would face the Goddesss wrath. Even priests would be reluctant to perform Kali puja, saying I have my family and kids.           
	But this changed in the 1970s. I do not know whether the violent political scenario in Bengal acted as a catalyst for the proliferation of Kali as the benevolent protector in the peoples collective mindset.           
	Today, Kali puja is organised by ascetics and hedonists alike, with its usual gambling and drinking sessions, and music systems blaring Jai Ho. The jai (victory) is definitely of the Goddess. She has successfully reinvented Herself, to broadbase Her protective appeal among the masses. No one now wants salvation from the Mother, or wants to see Her. All they want from Her is protection  from road accidents, from erratic stock prices, from cantankerous bosses, from paranoid wives and alcoholic husbands, from land mafia, and road blockades.           
	Tapan Pal,           
	Batanagar                       Green therapy for babus: Apropos of Cadets, students clean up the citys lungs, October 12, the Maidan is littered with tonnes of garbage, especially on weekends. It has perhaps become necessary to amend the law so that offenders can be fined and/or punished for littering the citys greens. This apart, the chief minister should consider deploying an army of babus for half a day every Monday for cleaning the Maidan. This will not affect the working of the government since precious little is done by the babus, in any case. On the contrary, this would also save electricity.   
	Apropos Prized pieces of Jinnah jigsaw, October 23, I think Mohammad Ali Jinnah wanted to free an undivided India. However, after the deadlock of the Cabinet Mission Plan and the Congresss vehement rejection for parity at the Centre, he changed his opinion. His problems were compounded when the idea of forming separate Hindu and Muslim majority provinces was not appreciated by either community. The Congress had made it clear that once the government was formed, the party would reserve the right to rescind approval to any earlier plan. Any analysis on the path taken by Jinnah and the Congress must not be viewed in isolation as nearly every action of theirs had a mirror reaction from the other side.             
	Debopratim Ray,
  Address not mentioned                     
	In response to the question Do you think Jinnah wanted a secular Pakistan?, October 23, I think Jinnah wanted a secular Pakistan but what he got was a moth-eaten country. Jinnah has been coloured in an unfavourable light by historians and politicians. He did not want an exclusively Islamic country but an Islamic Presidency within a greater India.           
	Oindrila Thakur,
  Kamalgazi           
	Although Jaswant Singh (in his book Jinnah  India, Partition, Independence) has given a clean chit to Jinnah, I think Jinnah was solely responsible for the partition of India and the ensuing bloodbath. Mahatma Gandhi was against Partition, but largescale violence and bitterness broke the country into two. I feel Partition was a blessing for both India and Pakistan.           
	Prahlad Agarwala,
  Majdia, Nadia                               
	Apropos Poll fireworks fear on campus, October 15, politics should always be kept away from two fields  education and religion. Politics is like a cesspit; once people fall into it they cannot get out and even if they do, they are covered in filth! College polls would be welcome had the elected members worked for the benefit of their institutions. Innocents who come to college to study suffer because of student elections.             
	Amrita Mallik,
  Salt Lake    
	After the furore over a rat chewing on a patients finger in SSKM Hospital, the superintendent decided to take action against the firm responsible for rat control on the premises (SSKM hauls up rat controller, October 20). One wonders why the authority ignored pest control until a patient was injured in this horrific manner. Strangely, it seemed that Bhattacharya was upset with the media for publishing the news of the rat attack. A sleeping patients finger being bitten by wild rats roaming in a city hospital would be an incredible news in any part of the world. But maybe appalling incidents in Bengal hospitals have become so regular that even attacks by feral animals do not appear as astonishing for the medical community.             
	Kunal Saha,
  Ohio, US                      
	This refers to Shortage of judges adds to case pile, October 19. The number of pending cases has piled to 3.5 lakh in the high court and 15.5 lakh in lower courts. In addition to shortage of judges, innumerable baseless cases have added to the problem. These cases are filed mainly by police and government departments to harass people. Recently, the Jharkhand government withdrew around 1.5 lakh cases as a symbolic gesture in Maoist-affected areas. To overcome the problem, the police and other agencies must pay compensation to victims of baseless cases.             
	Hara Lal Chakraborty,
  Arabinda Nagar                               
	We were returning to Calcutta on Saturday night and made a booking, around 11.30am, with the Mega Cabs service, for an airport pick-up at 10pm. The booking reference was 227.             
	On landing in Calcutta at 9.45pm, I was surprised that Mega Cabs had not messaged the contact details of the driver. I called Mega Cabs and, despite holding on for 20 minutes, the call remained unanswered. From No.3 in the queue, I moved up to No.1, but thats it. When I called again, I moved from No.10 to No.8 and, then, was stuck.           
	The pre-paid counter was ruled out as at least 50 passengers were in queue by then. I went to Avis and had to pay Rs 1,470 for a drop to my residence. That was about three times more than what I would have paid Mega Cabs.           
	Around 11.30pm, when we reached home, somebody who identified himself as Dev called from Mega Cabs, claiming some network problem had arisen.           
	The questions/issues raised are:           
	A) If there indeed was a problem, why did Mega Cabs not have a representative at the airport to help make alternative arrangements?           
	B) Why was no SMS sent?           
	C) Why was no call made after we landed? Why was a call made only at 11.30pm, knowing that by then the customer wouldve reached home through other means?           
	D) How do we get compensated for the harassment at?           
	E) Will anybody be held accountable?           
	Ratna Sahi,           
	S.N.Roy Road                     
	Mega Cabs reply: Mega Cabs always strives towards excellence in customer service. However, unforeseen situations, as in this case, come up. We deeply regret the same and shall definitely make arrangements so that such situations do not arise in future. We apologise to all our customers who had faced problems that night due to grave technical failure.           
	Binod Mishra,                         
	Following are a few clarifications about the accident on Monday involving a child while she was on her way to school in a chartered bus (Girl falls of schoolbus). It is not true that Shri Shikshayatan authorities had washed their hands of the matter. On hearing the news, I rushed to SSKM Hospital. Later, along with the childs family, the headmistress of the primary section and I went to Calcutta Medical Research Institute. I also reprimanded the bus manager in the presence of guardians. On Tuesday, the CEO, the assistant vice-principal of the school and I went to see the child in hospital. We shall continue to be by the parents side.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Weekend target for power relief   Power, rain eye weekend respite
                                                                                                               Weekend target for power relief             A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Samrat Dutta of Kankurgachhi works for a global power company, but he is quite powerless these days.        
	I dread coming home after a hard days work. The power cuts have even claimed the street lights, leaving the roads pitch dark. I stepped into a pothole last night and sprained my ankle, said the 26-year-old.        
	Dutta was one of the many victims of rotational power cuts, of one to four hours, as the city sweated and suffered for the fourth consecutive day.        
	The power utilities signalled weekend respite, but at 7pm on Wednesday, the shortfall in the CESC-served areas was 40MW and around 450MW in areas under the state electricity distribution company.        
	Both the power suppliers claimed that things were improving slowly but steadily, as the shortfall had dropped by 30MW in CESC areas and by 150MW in the West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Limited areas compared with 7pm on Tuesday.        
	Power cuts continued to plague Sinthee, Dum Dum, Salt Lake, Ultadanga, Kankurgachhi, Beleghata, Shyambazar, College Street, Bowbazar, Rashbehari, Hazra and Tollygunge.                    
	The power situation in CESC-served areas was a little better on Wednesday thanks to 922MW of CESCs sent-out power (the amount after factoring in loss during transmission) plus imported power of 545MW, said a CESC official.        
	The shortfall was less because we purchased 170MW from other states and received an extra 250MW from West Bengal Power Development Corporation Limited. The situation will normalise by the weekend, said an official of the state electricity distribution company.        
	Power supply has been hit by coal dampened by showers while demand has been pushed up by heat and humidity. If the power situation showed signs of improvement on Wednesday, an afternoon shower brought momentary relief. But the maximum temperature was 35.8 degree Celsius, four degrees above normal, the maximum humidity was 97 per cent and the discomfort index read 62 degree Celsius, seven points above normal.  
	Intermittent rain is expected on Thursday, which should lower the discomfort index. Things should improve towards the weekend, said Gokul Chandra Debnath of Alipore Met office.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Dry prelude to wet weekend
                                                                                                               Dry prelude to wet weekend
          A STAFF REPORTER                                      
	A brief lull in the monsoon has set in, with the weatherman predicting relatively less rainfall and higher temperature over the next two days. The weekend, however, could be wet and cool.        
	There was scattered rainfall on Wednesday but most parts of Calcutta and its neighbourhood remained sultry but dry.        
	The day saw less rainfall than the first few days of the week. The next 24-48 hours might be the same, primarily because of the weakening of the cyclonic circulation over Bay of Bengal which was bringing heavy rainfall in south Bengal, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	Independent weather analysts have ruled out chances of a prolonged lull in the monsoon flow as had happened after its early arrival in the state on May 25.        
	The reduced rainfall should not give rise to fears of another dormant phase. The monsoon flow has been revived fully and will not wane for the rest of the season, though there may be some regional irregularities, said the chief meteorologist of a non-government agency which offers customised weather services.        
	A source in the weather office said there were chances of the monsoon being revived over south Bengal towards the weekend.        
	The picture taken by satellite KALPANA-1 at 2.30pm on Wednesday shows convective clouds over northwest and central Bay of Bengal, which should bring rain to south Bengal over the weekend, said an official in the Indian Meteorological Department. A low-pressure area is likely to form over the west-central and adjoining northwest Bay over the weekend, bringing heavy rain to south Bengal, the official added.        
	After being dormant for over a month since May 25, the southwest monsoon advanced in leaps and bounds to engulf the whole of India by July 3, 12 days ahead of schedule.        
	The maximum temperature in the city on Wednesday was 32.6 degrees Celsius, one point above normal. The minimum temperature  26.8  stayed a degree above normal. The discomfort index touched 61 degrees Celsius, six points above normal, and the humidity ranged between 95 per cent and 66 per cent.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Parking menace on chaos corridor
                                                                                                               Parking menace on chaos corridor
          ONTHESPOT - ILLEGAL TAXI STANDS                                  (From top) Unauthorised taxi stands at Nagerbazar, Ultadanga and the Shyambazar five-point crossing. Pictures by Bishwarup Dutta                          
	Political parties are there to protect them and police are afraid to confront them. With the law-enforcers turning a blind eye, illegal taxi stands at vital intersections have become a major source of traffic congestion. Metro takes a walk around the three peril points in north Calcutta.               
	The Ultadanga crossing         
	Taxis occupy a vital portion of the stretch that joins VIP Road with the approach to EM Bypass and Kankurgachhi.         
	Metro found around 10 taxis parked under a banner of the Citu-affiliated Calcutta Taxi Workers Union on Friday afternoon.         
	When there are a lot of taxis, some queue up in a double lane, eating up a large road space. The taxis often move back and forth to get into the queue and as the buses also move at very high speed, the situation becomes scary, said Ranjan Ghosh, a commuter.         
	To make matters worse, an autorickshaw stand, owing allegiance to the Trinamul Congress, blocks the mouth of the EM Bypass, adding to the traffic stalemate.               
	Nagerbazar        
	The Nagerbazar crossing, where taxis have a free run, is under Citu control. Red flags flutter from the traffic stand in the middle of the road. There are no policemen in sight; the traffic is supervised by baton-wielding Citu workers. Often, the taxi drivers coerce commuters to pay more than the meter charge.         
	The taxis can easily park some distance away from the crossing, but they dont. The long queue of cabs often results in a bottleneck at the crossing. Buses coming from the Ordnance factory side have to wait for the taxis to move and make room for them, said Avishek Dasgupta, who lives off Jessore Road.        
	Shyambazar five-point crossing        
	The northern flank of Bhupen Bose Avenue is taxi turf, which adds to the congestion at the five-point crossing. The taxis park right under a no-parking board put up by Calcutta police. The traffic sergeants posted at the crossing seldom take action against the taxis.         
	The taxi stand must immediately be shifted elsewhere. The pavement has been taken over by hawkers, so most pedestrians walk on the road. Its a very dangerous situation, said Ashis Dutta, a pedestrian.         
	Policespeak        
	If an area is declared a no-parking zone by the police, it cannot be turned into a taxi stand. We usually allow taxis to queue up in places that dont affect the traffic movement. The police can take action under sections 122 and 177 of the Motor Vehicles Act against errant taxi drivers, said Dilip Banerjee, the deputy commissioner of Calcutta police, traffic.         
	Shyamal Ghosh, the deputy superintendent of police (traffic), North 24-Parganas, couldnt explain how illegal taxi stands are thriving in Nagerbazar.         
	Our main problem is inadequate manpower. As a result, we cant take any major drive against illegal taxi stands, said Ghosh.

	It is true that taxi stands on vital roads, like the one at Ultadanga, create traffic congestion. But where will the taxis wait? We will have to find a solution. We are supposed to have a meeting with the police in the mayors presence, said Nirmal Majumdar, the general secretary of the Citu-affiliated Calcutta Taxi Workers Union.         
	Jahar Ghosal, a senior leader of Citus North 24-Parganas unit, admitted that the taxi stand in Nagerbazar throws traffic out of gear. The waiting taxis at the Nagerbazar crossing create traffic snarls but we cant shift the stand elsewhere, he said.

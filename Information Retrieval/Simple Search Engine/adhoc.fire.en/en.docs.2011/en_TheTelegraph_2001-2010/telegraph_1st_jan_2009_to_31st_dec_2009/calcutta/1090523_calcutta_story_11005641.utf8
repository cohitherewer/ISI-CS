The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Gun graft trail leads to gold, cash in locker
                                                                                                               Gun graft trail leads to gold, cash in locker
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Sudipta Ghosh                                  
	The defence scam allegedly masterminded by Sudipta Ghosh, a former director-general of ordnance, was much bigger than what the CBI had initially estimated, sleuths said on Friday.        
	On Thursday, a CBI team seized Rs 56 lakh, Euro 13,000 and 47 gold coins from the two bank lockers of Ghosh, who was arrested on Tuesday along with three others.        
	Earlier, the sleuths had seized cash and jewellery worth about Rs 1.5 crore from Ghoshs four homes in Salt Lake, Alipore, Behala and Phoolbagan.        
	Ghosh, who retired as chairman of the Ordnance Factory Board, had allegedly earned crores from Indian and foreign companies while awarding them contracts over the past two years.        
	With the help of middlemen, Ghosh had awarded contracts for equipment used by the armed forces. We have zeroed in on eight firms, including two based abroad, that supplied the bulk of defence hardware and technology between 2007 and 2009. Their assets are being probed, said an official.        
	The racket operated through a well-knit network Ghosh had developed in Delhi and Calcutta. Quite a few private parties, both Indian and foreign, are part of the racket, the official said.        
	The CBI has come across documents suggesting that Ghosh, a 1971 batch officer of the Indian Ordnance Factories Service, had struck defence deals with more than 20 companies, violating rules. The firms, in return, paid him more than Rs 10-15 crore, said an official working on the case. We have forwarded a detailed report, including the names of the private players involved in the scam, to the defence ministry.        
	Those arrested with Ghosh are his brother-in-law Asish Bose, Kanhaiya Lal Das and Pradeep Rana.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Principals meet UGC for grants 
                                                                                                               Principals meet UGC for grants 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The University Grants Commission (UGC) on Tuesday began a three-day meet with the principals of colleges in Calcutta to allocate funds for infrastructure development under the Eleventh Plan.        
	Heads of over 100 colleges in the city and nearly 300 more from the rest of the state will attend the meeting, UGC officials said.         
	Colleges are an important component of the higher education system and the UGC has decided to offer grants for improving their infrastructure during the Eleventh Plan period (2007-12), said a senior UGC official.        
	Colleges can get grants up of to Rs 1 crore if the central body finds merit in their demands and provided the institutions meet the conditions stipulated for availing themselves of the grants. The minimum grant amount is Rs 11 lakh.        
	UGC officials will meet the college heads on an individual basis. To get a UGC grant, colleges offering arts and commerce courses must have at least eight full-time teachers, while colleges teaching science must have a minimum of 12 full-time teachers. Funds allocation will depend on student intake, too.        
	The UGC has agreed to accept nearly 70 per cent of our proposals, said a principal of a south Calcutta college, who submitted proposals for a grant of around Rs 1 crore.        
	The assistance is aimed at improving the teaching-learning process by upgrading basic facilities, such as library, laboratory and connectivity, the UGC official explained.        
	The central body has suggested 15 schemes under which the colleges can submit their proposals. New institutions can seek funds to catch up with the established ones.        
	Colleges can seek assistance to set up career counselling centres and coaching and remedial centres for students from minority communities and backward sections.        
	Funds can also be sought to set up day care centres on the college premises for the children of employees and students and to introduce special facilities for promoting education among disabled students.

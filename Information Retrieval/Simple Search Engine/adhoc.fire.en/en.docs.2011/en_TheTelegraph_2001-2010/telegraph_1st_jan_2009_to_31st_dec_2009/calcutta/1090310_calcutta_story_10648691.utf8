The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Slowdown at city centre
                                                                                                               Slowdown at city centre
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	On a day the Congress and the Trinamul inched towards a pre-poll alliance, the Congress, CPM and the SUCI combined to paralyse the city centre for hours.        
	Maximum damage on Monday afternoon was done by 10,000-plus supporters of Krishak and Khetshramik Sangathan  an affiliate of the SUCI  that choked north and central Calcutta by taking over a 4km stretch between Hatibagan and Esplanade.        
	Earlier in the day, between 1pm and 2.30pm, around 2,500 people gathered on Rani Rashmoni Road, where the minority cell of the Congress organised a meeting that was attended by Deepa Das Munshi.        
	Another procession by the Ganatantrik Mahila Samity  womens wing of the CPM  set out from Subodh Mullick Square at 3pm and marched to the Ramlila Ground in Entally.         
	The city centre was choked from 1pm and vehicular movement in Esplanade and the adjoining areas was affected till 7pm, said a senior traffic department officer.        
	Though more than 300 cops were deployed to maintain order, once the SUCI rally set off for Esplanade, traffic slowed to a crawl and then ground to a halt on several roads.        
	We can facilitate the movement of vehicles only if there are some roads that are not choked. All major roads  Maniktala Main Road, College Street, BB Ganguly Street, Lenin Sarani and Chowringhee  witnessed major traffic snarls, said a senior police officer.        
	Sumit Pachisia, stuck for over an hour on CR Avenue, said: When it comes to inconveniencing people and bringing the city to a halt, all political parties are the same.

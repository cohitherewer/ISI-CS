        JAYANTA BASU                          Fireworks on Diwali night                                        
	The state pollution control board on Thursday directed the Burrabazar Fireworks Dealers Association to disclose within 48 hours details of banned fireworks supplied by Sivakasi manufacturers and send these back within 15 days or face action.         
	The order was passed by Biswajit Mukherjee, the chief law officer of the board, at a hearing convened by chairman Asok Nath Bose. The dealers had brought 55 types of fireworks from Sivakasi in Tamil Nadu, of which 41 were banned by police a few days before Diwali.         
	In Bengal, fireworks that produce more than 90 decibel sound at five metres from the source are banned.         
	Some of the firecrackers broke the national decibel norm too  125 at four metres from the source  and the board questioned how such items were cleared by the explosives department of the Centre for the rest of the country.         
	Board officials feel steps to enforce the cracker ban in the state came too late, by when many of the banned items had reached the market.         
	The boards order directed the association to disclose details of the storage of the banned fireworks and the location of their godowns within 48 hours. The association was also asked to send the banned fireworks out of the state within 15 days and send compliance reports to the state pollution control board, director- general of police and the commissioner of police.         
	The board put the onus of preventing the entry of such crackers into the market in future on the association.         
	On Thursday, the association members admitted that the banned fireworks came to the state two to three months before Diwali and blamed manufacturers in Sivakasi for supplying high-decibel items despite being told about the noise norms in Bengal.         
	Green activists, however, called for a greater role of the court. In the late Nineties, we achieved significant success in noise control mainly because of the intervention of the judiciary I will mention the matter in the high court on Friday, said activist Subhas Dutta on Thursday.

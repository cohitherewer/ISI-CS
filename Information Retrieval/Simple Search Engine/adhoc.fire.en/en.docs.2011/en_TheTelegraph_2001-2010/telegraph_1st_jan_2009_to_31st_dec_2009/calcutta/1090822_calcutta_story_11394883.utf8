	Space flights amp; walk  
	Young space enthusiasts were in for a treat on August 12 when Swiss astronaut Claude Nicollier delivered a presentation on space missions at the Birla Industrial and Technological Museum.   
	Credited with four Nasa space flights and a space walk, Nicollier emphasised the importance of hard work to withstand the fierce competition in this field.         
	Engineering, science and medicine are areas where aspiring astronauts can train, he said. Sports like scuba diving and mountaineering also help, as they teach one to deal with dangers, making one capable of taking quick decisions, he added.        
	Fielding queries on the space walk, he explained: One carries all life support in a backpack and a small cable is all that connects the astronaut to the space shuttle. About 150 hours of extensive space training goes behind an eight-hour space walk, he added.         
	About 200 students from 21 schools, including La Martiniere for Boys and Mahadevi Birla Higher Secondary School, attended the talk.        
	Contrary to popular notion, Nicollier said that space debris is not always a cause for concern. The radar usually tracks large debris a few days in advance, and the spacecraft can shift its orbit a little to avoid it, he said.         
	But he stressed that it was important not to leave anything in space, including tools used in missions. Only if we do this will we be making future missions safer, he said.        
	He also discussed Swiss Cube, a satellite designed and built by Swiss students, to be launched at Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Andhra Pradesh by the end of 2009.         
	Nicolliers presentation included vivid images of volcanic eruptions viewed from space, and auroras. He also paid tribute to astronauts of Indian origin, like Sunita Williams, the late Kalpana Chawla and Rakesh Sharma.         
	Said Shruti Jhunjhunwala, a Class XII student of Welland Gouldsmith School, who was at the talk with her friends: Such interactions help us gain valuable knowledge about space missions.

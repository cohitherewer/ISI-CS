The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 30 security hot spots
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      30 security hot spots
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	An intelligence input from Delhi has identified at least eight major street crossings and a few popular spots as the likely targets of terror groups from across the border.        
	The popular spots on the list include New Market and the numerous small temples on Strand Road and Nimtola Ghat Street. The vulnerable crossings are on AJC Bose Road, Sarat Bose Road, Prince Anwar Shah Road and the Bypass.        
	Security has been stepped up around the 30-odd points that have been identified as vulnerable so far, said a senior officer at Lalbazar.        
	The Centre had recently warned that terror groups  backed by the Taliban and the Lashkar-e-Toiba  had entered the country through Kupwara district in J amp;K and spread across the country in an attempt to trigger blasts in select cities, including Calcutta.         
	On Wednesday, the chief minister reviewed the security preparedness at a meeting attended by the chief secretary, home secretary, director-general of police and the police commissioner.        
	An officer of the special branch said: There is no timeline but we have decided to maintain the heightened vigil at least till Republic Day, keeping in mind the threats from within the country and outside.        
	Senior officers said bunkers would be set up at strategic intersections across the city and patrolling intensified.        
	A separate log will have to be maintained for the security checks and the teams carrying out the inspections will have to submit reports to an officer of the rank of additional commissioner of police.        
	Middle-level officers, however, are not sure whether the heightened security could be maintained with the present staff strength. The police stations do not have enough personnel to meet the extra demand, said an officer of Kalighat police station. Besides, a large contingent is away in Jharkhand on election duty.        
	A senior officer said the battalions and reserve forces would be immediately deployed on security duty to make up for the staff shortfall.

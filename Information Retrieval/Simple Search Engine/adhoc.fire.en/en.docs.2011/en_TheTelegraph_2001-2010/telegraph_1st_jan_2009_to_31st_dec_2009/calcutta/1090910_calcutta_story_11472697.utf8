The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Online debut for CAT
                                                                                                               Online debut for CAT
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Registration for Common Admission Test (CAT) 2009 opened on Wednesday with thousands filling up the online form. The process was smooth on Day One but students voiced worries about taking the test online for the first time.        
	Our students didnt face any problems in registering for CAT 2009, but some issues have cropped that I hope will be addressed soon, said Rahul Reddy, of Triumphant Institute of Management and Engineering (TIME).        
	One of the main problems is the unavailability of options for correcting errors on the form. There is no option to go back and correct any mistake made while filling up the form except for registering afresh, pointed out Reddy.        
	According to the IIM website, applicants who want to make changes on their registration form will have to purchase another voucher of Rs 1,400 and register again.        
	I will have to be really careful. Rs 1,400 is no small amount and a mistake will also mean losing out on time, which would mean I might not get a date of my choice, said a first-time applicant.        
	Training institutes are also worried about the possibility of technical glitches during the tests. Some of our students are apprehensive that there might be a power cut or a software glitch while they take the test, said Kaushik Kapoor of coaching centre Erudite.        
	Most coaching institutes in the city have advised students to not write the test, which has to be taken between November 28 and December 7, on the first two days as any snag that crops up is likely to be rectified later.         
	Opting for a later date would also enable examinees to gather information about the pattern of question and the difficulties they are likely to face, feel teachers at the coaching institutes.         
	IIM authorities are, however, not worried about the possibility of glitches during the test that more than three lakh students are expected to take.        
	Each computer will have a UPS back-up. Moreover, Prometric, which has structured CAT, also conducts GRE so there shouldnt be any problem, said Subrata Mitra, the chairman (admissions) of IIM Calcutta.        
	Training institutes have also advised students to choose a test centre on the basis of infrastructure available. Some centres set up recently may lack infrastructure, which might affect a students performance, said Reddy.        
	Some candidates are also fretting the loss of the comfort factor that comes with taking a test on paper. The pen-and-paper format allowed us to mark lines and phrases in the reading comprehension section and write down data on the graph for the data interpretation portion, a second-time applicant.

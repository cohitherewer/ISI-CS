The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Eye on Eden, from far and near
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Eye on Eden, from far and near
  - Terrace with a view and talk about sunset and Celsius          RITH BASU AND SUDESHNA BANERJEE                          Fans enjoy an unobstructed view of the India-Sri Lanka match on Thursday from a terrace of the All India Radio building adjacent to Eden.

	You couldnt have been at Eden Gardens on Thursday unless you were a member of the Cricket Association of Bengal or an affiliate, or you knew someone who was.        
	Tickets not being sold over the counter this year meant the best available seat for most was the couch in front of the TV.        
	For those who missed being up close to the action, Metro brings an inside-out view from two vantage points: the BC Roy Club House and the nearby All India Radio (AIR) building whose terrace offered a ringside view of the proceedings through a, well, rather large hole in the Eden wall...        
	 FROM THE OUTSIDE        
	Until 1987, veteran AIR employees would watch every cricket (or football) match at Eden Gardens from their office terrace. Till the covered galleries shut them out before World Cup 1987. With the barrier demolished as part of Edens makeover for World Cup 2011, it was back to the terrace for those like R.P. Malakar, 58.        
	I saw Pele in action from this very terrace 32 years ago. It was like a dream. Sitting here I also watched many wonderful innings by my favourite batsman, Sunil Gavaskar. All those memories are coming back to me now, smiled Malakar, who joined Akashvani in 1976 as a Hindi typist.        
	All the terraces of the six-storeyed landmark provided a lateral view of the pitch. In a way it was better than actually being in the stadium because no one stopped the AIR employees, and their children and relatives, from entering the seating area with food, water, soft drink bottles, binoculars and cameras.        
	Little Rajdeep Sarkar, who had come to see the match with his father Biplab  an assistant engineer with AIR  said he was happy with the view but would not settle for anything less than a gallery seat during the next edition of the Indian Premier League, when Shah Rukh Khan would dance in the stands.        
	FROM THE INSIDE        
	 Didi did not turn up despite the buzz but Dada did, with daughter Sana during the innings break. Sourav Ganguly sat in the upper tier of the VIP box, where he was soon joined by Siddhartha Shankar Ray. The former Team India skipper descended in over number seven with former Bengal captain Sambaran Banerjee. The seats they chose were just above the sightscreen, which apparently angered match referee A.G. Hurst.        
	But who would bell the big cat in his own (E)den? The cops were in a fix till Sourav spared them the blushes by returning to the VIP box. Sourav left the ground in over number 22 to a loud cheer from his fans. The hometown hero ruled (till Gambhir and Kohli came along); Mamata Banerjee was not missed.        
	 The Eden crowd got to enjoy a sunset on the Babughat side after decades. Eden veterans reminisced how the sunset would be a fitting finale to a good days (Test) cricket in the good old times. Then, a tent that served as a pavilion made way for the two-tier B and C blocks. They are now reduced to makeover rubble, making way for the sunset.        
	 As India inched towards victory, more people were asking Whats the temperature? rather than Whats the asking rate? Its freezing here, sighed a college girl, wrapped in a shawl. Her father, an Eden veteran, said Thursday was the coldest he had seen at the ground.        
	 The usual cries of we want sixer were missing even when the target was 12 off 20 balls. Snuffing out the opposition slowly is more enjoyable, said jewellery designer Nilaanjana Chakraborty.

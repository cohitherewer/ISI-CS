The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tenth from 10ftx8ft room
                                                                                                               Tenth from 10ftx8ft room
          AMRITA GHOSH AND JHINUK MAZUMDAR                          Dipankar in his Shibpur room. (Gopal Senapati)                                  
	A couple who earn Rs 2,900 a month and cannot afford more than a 10ftx8ft room in Shibpur were on top of the world on Tuesday. Their son Dipankar Maity had battled and beaten the odds to soar to the 10th spot in JEE 2009 (engineering).        
	The student from Howrahs Baje Shibpur BK Paul Institution  Dipankar might have been forced to quit studies had the school not waived his fees  is now training his sights on being an electrical engineer from Jadavpur University.         
	Dipankar had fixed his priority right after Madhyamik, in which he scored 94.6 per cent, and stayed focussed over the next two years.        
	I concentrated fully on the JEE. I never entertained any thought about appearing in the IIT admission test as the application form, which costs Rs 1,000, and separate books and tuitions would have been too expensive for my parents, said Dipankar, sitting in the cramped room whose tiled roof leaks even during a moderate shower.        
	But for one whose passions are mathematics, Manik Bandopadhyay and Rabindrasangeet, the room and the surrounding chaos were hardly a hindrance. I have been living here since my childhood. They have become part of my life.        
	Tucked away in a narrow lane, the room has one cot which is shared by Dipankar and his books. His parents sleep on the floor. Since the house has no water supply, the family members have to queue up at the public tap.        
	Money is always a problem but one thing we tried to ensure was that he was never on an empty stomach, said mother Maya, who earns Rs 1,000 a month making purses and bags at home. Father Basudeb Maity earns Rs 1,900 delivering iron pipes.        
	The parents were a bit apprehensive before the HS exam as Dipankar was focussing more on the JEE than the board test. We were worried what would happen had he failed to crack the JEE, the mother recounted.        
	Proving her fears wrong, Dipankar scored 88.4 per cent in HS and then aced JEE.        
	In his moment of triumph, the boy remembered his private tutors who taught him free, teachers and friends who provided him with reference books and Pathfinder, a coaching centre which allowed him to take its mock tests without being enrolled.        
	A source of Dipankars sustenance for the past two years was the Rs 6,000 he got in two instalments as scholarship from Mohananda Brahmachari Merit Trust.        
	But what will see him through the next four years in the engineering college? I will apply for government and other scholarships, was his calm, yet resolute, reply.

                      Images of Indian history                    Paintings depicting historical events have always enjoyed an important position in the hierarchy of visual arts. Conceived with unparalleled scholarly zeal, Glimpses of Ancient India, the ongoing exhibition of paintings by Prabhatmohan Bandyopadhyay, certainly ranks high within this genre. Exhibited first at Academy of Fine Arts in 1968 and subsequently at Kala-Bhavana, Santiniketan in 1969 and 2004, the current show is being hosted at the annual exhibition of Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Cultures Museum amp; Art Gallery. Though Bandyopadhyay started to paint this series of 27 paintings quite late in life, the ideas behind them must have been germinating for a long time. His familiarity with Indian art heritage, his love for classical art and literature and his knowledge of Indian spiritual texts, archaeology and classical literature, all yielded their combined essence in the visualisation of this magnum opus. Blending imagination with historical evidence, the works provide more than visual delight. A detailed text accompanying each of his paintings describes the theme of the work as well as the sources of visual references.

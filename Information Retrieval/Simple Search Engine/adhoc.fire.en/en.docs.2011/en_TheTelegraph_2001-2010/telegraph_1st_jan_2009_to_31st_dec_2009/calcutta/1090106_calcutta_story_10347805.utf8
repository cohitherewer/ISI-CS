                                                                                                               Hooch attack as toll 25
          A STAFF REPORTER                                        Residents burn tyres to press for the release of the bodies of the victims. 
  (Amit Datta)       
	The spurious liquor tragedy claimed 10 more lives in the port area on Monday, taking the toll to 25 and prompting government action against officials and resident action against hooch dens.        
	Shakilur Rehman, the officer-in-charge of West Port police station, was transferred to the special branch.        
	Showcause notices have been slapped on two officials of the excise department  a deputy collector and a sub-inspector  for their alleged failure to stop illicit liquor trade.        
	Debasish Sarkar, of the special branch, will take over from Rehman.        
	Six persons who have been arrested since Sunday for running the hooch trade have been charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder.         
	During the day, finance minister Asim Dasgupta said police and the excise department would conduct joint raids on hooch dens this week.        
	The chief minister is concerned over the death of 25 people in the port area. We will crack down on illicit liquor dens in the city and districts on a war footing from Tuesday, Dasgupta said.        
	Earlier, the minister discussed ways to stop mushrooming of illicit liquor outlets with home secretary Ardhendu Sen, excise secretary C.M. Bachawat and police chief Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti.        
	Dasgupta ruled out providing compensation to the next of kin of those who died. There is no provision for giving compensation to family members of those who die after drinking spurious liquor. The government, however, will bear the medical expenses of those taken ill, he added.        
	Residents of Sonai Bustee, Jain Kunj and Hooghly Jute Mill Colony  worst-hit by the tragedy  did not wait for the police to start their drive. Batons in hand, they marched from one shanty to another and smashed 35 hooch dens.        
	In some of the adjacent areas, including Taratala and North and South Port, the police destroyed 20 illicit liquor dens and rounded up 12 people.        
	Deputy commissioner (detective department) Jawed Shamim said the sleuths were trying to find out where the racket sourced the liquor from.        
	Some officers said bulk of the spurious liquor sold in the port area came from a factory in Pailan, South 24-Parganas. Similar units have sprung up in other fringe areas too.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Heavy rain ahead
                                                                                                               Heavy rain ahead
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The Met office has predicted intensified rainfall over the next few days.        
	The cyclonic circulation that formed over Jharkhand on Saturday is now hovering over coastal Bengal and north Bay of Bengal. Under its influence, a low-pressure area could form over the northwest and west-central Bay in the next 48 hours, bringing rain to south Bengal over the week, said an official at the Regional Meteorological Centre, Alipore.        
	The showers, the official added, would be more intense than what the city received last week.        
	Calcutta experienced 4.9mm of rainfall on Sunday.

                                                                                                               Varsity firm on ragging penalty
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The Jadavpur University authorities on Wednesday refused to repeal the punishment of three architecture students who allegedly ragged a fresher last year.        
	The students, who have served a year of their two-year suspension, had appealed to the authorities to repeal their punishment.        
	The executive council on Wednesday decided to forward the appeal to governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi, the chancellor of the university.        
	It is not possible to repeal the punishment. The executive council unanimously decided to forward the appeal to the chancellor, said Parthapratim Biswas, a member of the council.        
	The three, along with 20 others, had allegedly locked a first-year architecture student in a room on the campus and forced her to smoke ganja, drink alcohol and chew tobacco.        
	The girls parents stated in their complaint that she had been sexually harassed.        
	The executive council also decided to maintain a uniform academic calendar for its three faculties.        
	Earlier in the day, more than 100 students demonstrated for two hours in front of Arabinda Bhawan, the venue of the executive council meeting, anticipating a 500 per cent hike in fees.        
	The protest was withdrawn after the students learnt that fee hike was not on the agenda of the meeting.

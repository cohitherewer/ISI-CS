                                                                                                               City stopover for French festival

	Come December, Calcutta will be treated to a French way of life.         
	CulturesFrance, the cultural wing of the French ministry of foreign affairs, along with the French embassy and the Alliance Francaise will organise Bonjour India, a festival of France. The event will be held in six cities, including Calcutta, Olivier Poivre dArvor, the head of CulturesFrance, announced on Thursday.        
	India and France are the two major countries for art. We need more links, he said, adding that India was most fashionable in France, because of economy, art, and the glamorous idea of Bollywood.        
	The festival will be spread across multiple platforms, which will be tailored according to the identity of each city hosting it. For Calcutta, the focus areas will be films and art, said Benedicte Alliot, the cultural attache with the French embassy. Some major exhibitions of modern art are being planned. One collection, including masterpieces of Picasso, Chagall, Monet and Matisse, will be sourced from Reunion Island in France.        
	There will be performances, street art and installations across the city. And food. We want to stress French food is not a gourmet affair and can be accessible. Think French wine and cheese, he smiled.        
	The organisers want to appeal to children as well as grown-ups. So a kite festival is being mooted.        
	A budget of Euro 3.5million has been allocated for the festival of which Euro 1 million comes from the French government. We are also looking for private sponsors.        
	The last major cultural exchange, Festival of France in India, took place in 1989 and had bypassed Calcutta. A whole generation has not been exposed to French culture, said DArvor.        
	The French ambassador will be in town around April. We will meet the governor, the chief minister and the mayor then. The festival will be at the top of the talks agenda, said Jean-Louis Rysto, the French consul in Calcutta.

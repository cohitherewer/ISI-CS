The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Results delay mar prospects
                                                                                                               Results delay mar prospects
                            
	The transfer of Calcutta Universitys controller of examinations will delay the publication of Part III results of BA, BSc and BCom. Metro got in touch with some Part III examinees who spoke about the uncertainties they have been facing because of the change in schedule                      
	Dipto Sarkar, computer science, Asutosh College: The reason CU has given for the delay is hilarious. I am applying to universities in the UK and Im worried. The universities have given me conditional offers on the basis of my previous results but I have to submit my Part III marksheet at the earliest. I can apply for visa and accommodation only after the offer is confirmed on submission of the marksheet. If there is too much delay in the announcement of results, the accommodation options may dry up.                        
	Somiddho Basu, geology, Presidency College: I have got through the admission test at the Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad. I will have to take admission there on July 3 after paying a fee of Rs 22,000. I have also cracked the IIT Kharagpur test but my admission will be confirmed only if I score 55 per cent marks in aggregate in graduation. Had the CU results been out I would have known where I stand.                        
	Madhura Sen, English, Bethune College: I have qualified in the selection test of the Asian College of Journalism, Chennai, and am supposed to take admission on July 11. Classes will begin by July 13. The college is constantly asking me about the results. Since I will shift to Chennai before July 11 and there is little chance of the results being declared before July 14, I will have to come down in the middle of the course to collect my marksheet.                        
	Adrija Dey, computer science, Asutosh College: The CU authorities should have been more responsible in handling things that affect declaration of results. Its students who ultimately suffer. I am supposed to appear in an interview at Jamia Milia Islamia on July 14. They have asked for the graduation marksheet.                        
	Debak Das, history, Presidency College: The university should have made the changes in advance keeping in mind the schedule of announcement of results. We have heard that the declaration of our results has been delayed by a fortnight but no one is certain how long we will have to wait. JNU allows provisional admission but what if a student does not get 50 per cent marks. He will then have to come back.                        
	Pousali Guha Biswas, English, Lady Brabourne College: I am applying for the banking entrance exams but I can only apply for a clerks position on the basis of my Higher Secondary marks. To apply for a probationary officers post I have to know my graduation results.

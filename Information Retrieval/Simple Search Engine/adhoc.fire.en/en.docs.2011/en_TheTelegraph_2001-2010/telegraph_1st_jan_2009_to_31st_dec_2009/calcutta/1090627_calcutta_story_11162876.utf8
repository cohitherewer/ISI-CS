The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Court firm on phase-out date
                                                                                                               Court firm on phase-out date
  - Govt warned against extension plea        OUR BUREAU                                          
	The high court on Friday said it would not entertain any request from the state government to extend the July 31 deadline for the phase-out of commercial vehicles more than 15 years old in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area.        
	The division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice B. Somadder, which made the observation, told advocate-general Balai Ray that the court would be forced to pass an altogether different order if the government failed to meet the deadline.        
	The observation followed a submission by environment activist Subhash Dutta that the government would not be able to meet the deadline and might approach the court for an extension.        
	The advocate-general, without clarifying whether the government was considering moving any such plea, submitted that the transport department was determined to phase out old vehicles and holding talks with the owners almost every day.        
	Government sources, however, ruled out any possibility of meeting the court deadline.        
	There has been no attempt at enforcing the ban on goods carriers and buses. The only progress has been in regard to taxis but there is hardly any chance of the order being implemented before the July 31 deadline, said a transport department official.        
	As for autorickshaws, only 1,500 from the 80,000-strong fleet in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area have been converted to four-stroke LPG mode. While delivering the phase-out order on July 18 last year, the high court had ruled that all autos must run on four-stroke LPG.        
	The panel appointed by the government, following a court prod, to monitor execution of the phase-out order met only twice since August last year.        
	Now, what can force the government to act? Anumita Roy Chowdhury, of the Centre for Science and Environment, cited a Supreme Court order on April 5, 2002, in response to repeated pleas by the Delhi government to defer the deadline for the conversion of buses to CNG.        
	The apex court had ruled that any plea for extension would be treated as contempt of court and imposed a fine of Rs 20,000 on the government for missing the deadline. Besides, each bus running on diesel after the deadline had to pay a penalty of Rs 1,000 a day. By December 2002, all buses in Delhi had converted to CNG.        
	The high courts warning to the state came during the hearing of a petition by Modern High School for Girls, which pleaded for an order exempting five of its buses that were more than 15 years old from the purview of the ban.        
	The school argued that its buses could not be called commercial vehicles according to the Motor Vehicles Act, and that the engines of the five buses were in good condition. The bench pointed out that 43 per cent of the children in Calcutta suffered from lung ailments caused by vehicular pollution. How can vehicles ferrying children to school defy anti-pollution guidelines? the bench wondered.

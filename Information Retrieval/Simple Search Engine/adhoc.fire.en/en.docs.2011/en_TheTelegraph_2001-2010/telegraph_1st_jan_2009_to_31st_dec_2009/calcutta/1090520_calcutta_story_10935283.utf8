The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Flyover plan under scanner
                                                                                                               Flyover plan under scanner
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                                                
	The civic no-objection certificate to the Vivekananda Road flyover plan has drawn attention to its faulty alignment.         
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), anticipating problems in shifting utility pipes under Strand Road to make space for the pillars of the proposed flyover, stated it had no objection to the plan if the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) could execute it, said Bibhas Kumar Maity, the chief engineer of the civic water supply wing.        
	Delhi-based firm Consulting Engineering Services designed the 2.6km flyover, connecting the Vivekananda Road-Rabindra Sarani crossing to Howrah bridge. The Centre has sanctioned funds under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission for the first phase of the Rs 164-crore project  from Howrah bridge to Girish Park.        
	Engineers in the civic water supply department pointed out to the CMDA that there is not enough space under Strand Road to shift water pipes and construct pillars of one arm of the proposed flyover.         
	There is a 42-inch diameter pipe for unfiltered water and 28-inch diameter pipe for filtered water besides several smaller pipes under Strand Road. Pillars with concrete bases of the Brabourne Road flyover already occupy more than half the 60ft wide road.        
	The pillars of one arm of the proposed flyover are to be built alongside those of the Brabourne Road flyover.        
	Civic engineers felt the arm  for traffic heading towards Howrah bridge should have descended on Strand Bank Road, which has few utility pipes underneath, instead of Strand Road.         
	A CMDA engineer said that was the original plan, which was changed to protect the Mullickghat flower market on Strand Bank Road. The change will pose technical problems and hike up the project cost, he felt.         
	The alignment of the flyover was changed to ensure the security of Rabindra Setu, claimed Sudhanshu Sil, the outgoing MP of Calcutta North-West and the chairman of Mullickghat flower market, who has been associated with the project since its inception.        
	The flyover will be built by tackling the problems that might crop up, said the chief executive officer of the CMDA, P.R. Baviskar.

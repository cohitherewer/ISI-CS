The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Big small cars in big fight 
                                                                                                               Big small cars in big fight 
          ANASUYA BASU                                            
	The small car big fight in town has now shifted gears to become the battle for the big small car.        
	With last weeks launch of Fiats big hatch, the Grande Punto, in town, the B+ segment is bustling.        
	If Maruti has the Swift and Ritz, Hyundai has its i10, i20 and Getz, Tata Motors its Indica Vista, General Motors its U-VA and Fiat its old Palio Stile and now the Grande Punto (see box).        
	To add to the crowd, there will be the Chevrolet Beat from General Motors by the end of the year and the Ford and Toyota hatches next year.        
	It all started at the entry level with the Maruti 800. Slowly the customers moved to a higher segment and we had the Santro, Spark, Wagon R fighting it out in the Rs 3 lakh-plus segment, said Gagandeep Singh, the regional manager of General Motors. Now buyers are not just upgrading but even first-time buyers are asking for more space and more features and so the fight in the B+ segment, prices for which start around Rs 4 lakh, has intensified.        
	Maruti and Hyundai are fighting it out in the volumes segment with multiple offerings. The B+ segment has seen a 10 per cent growth in sales in the east in recent times, said Priyesh Kumar of Hyundai. We believe consumers are going to upgrade. A customer in the east very typically upgrades his car every five years. So by 2010-11, it will be the B+ segment that will be the prime mover in the automobile market.        
	For Maruti Suzuki, 60 per cent of the sales come from the entire B segment. Swift and Ritz are our premium offerings in the B+ category. We expect our Wagon R, Zen customers to upgrade to Swift and Ritz.        
	Last week, Rajiv Dhawan, 32, a banker, walked into a Maruti showroom on AJC Bose Road, with his wife Purnima to test-drive the Ritz. The Dhawans want a second car, with a sedan already in the garage. My wife drives an old Santro. It needs to be upgraded and we are thinking of a big hatchback that will seat our kids and my parents comfortably.        
	Dhawan has already taken a ride on the Tata Indica Vista, the i20 and the U-VA. Its good to have multiple choices, giving a buyer like me the confidence of getting the best within his budget.        
	The competition is not just in terms of multiple models but price bands too. The Punto comes with a price tag of Rs 4.05 lakh to Rs 6.17 lakh, ex-showroom Calcutta, mainly because of localisation of components, explains Rajeev Kapoor, the CEO of Fiat India Automobiles Ltd. The company plans to further increase localisation to 85 per cent by year-end.        
	With competitive pricing becoming the keyword, multi-national auto manufacturers are cutting down on imports and procuring components locally. On an average, the auto players have vendors in India supplying about 50 per cent of parts.        
	The bestseller in the big small car segment in town remains the petrol variant of the Swift. We are neck and neck in terms of pricing with the Punto. Besides, the Swift diesel shares the same engine as the Punto. Our spares are also cheaper, argues a Maruti man.        
	The KB Motors Fiat outlet on Judges Court Road has been drawing the curious. Saugata Mitra, a 25-year-old software engineer, eyeing the Puntos tail lights, said: I came to check out the latest from Fiat. Its amazing how new cars in this segment seem to be coming up every month.

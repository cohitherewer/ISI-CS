                                                                                                               Accused was to visit J amp;K: cops
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Jyoti Rana, the alleged recruiter for Pakistans Inter Services Intelligence, might have planned to head for Jammu and Kashmir after spending a few days in the city, police said on Monday.        
	Jyoti, alias Mehrunnisa, alias Nisha Sharma, was arrested at the city airport on Sunday afternoon while she was going through immigration check after arriving from Bangkok.        
	She was produced in Barrackpore court and remanded in judicial custody till October 19. A team of cops from Delhi will reach the city to interrogate Jyoti as a case of human trafficking is pending against her with the capitals Uttamnagar police station.        
	Her plans are not yet clear to us but we suspect she intended to put up in the city before heading for Jammu and Kashmir, said an officer in the team that interrogated the woman.        
	Jyoti, a resident of Delhi, travelled to a number of countries by forging passports and using different names. She visited Dubai, Bangkok and Malaysia on several occasions, said an officer.        
	We suspect she had trafficked a number of youths from India to Malaysia and handed them over to Pakistans spy agency. It seems the youths were trained in terrorism in Malaysia and sent back to India for carrying out subversive activities, the officer added.

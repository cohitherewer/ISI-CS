The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Court scan on truant taxis
                                                                                                               Court scan on truant taxis
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                                        Metro report on March 6 on tampering with taxi meters      
	The transport department has been running a taxi meter testing centre in Salt Lake since March 1 but not one operator has got his meter checked, a state lawyer told the high court on Wednesday.        
	Subrata Mukhopadhyay submitted that the transport department had issued a notification on February 18 making it mandatory for taxi owners to get their meters checked at the Taxi Meter Testing Centre twice a year. Each test costs Rs 300. But since the issuance of the notification, not a single owner has come to the centre with his vehicle.        
	Mukhopadhyays submission prompted Justice Jayanta Biswas to refuse a stay on the operation of the notification, as sought by three associations of taxi owners and drivers. The judge also allowed the transport department to run the centre till further orders.        
	The associations petition  Justice Biswas admitted it on Monday and gave the state two days to clarify its stand  alleged that the transport department was violating rules by asking taxi operators to get their meters checked by a private agency for a fee.        
	The petitioners lawyer Arunava Ghosh claimed that the agency  Bhagwandas and Company  was a manufacturer of taxi meters and wondered how it could be entrusted with the checking job.        
	But Basabi Roy Chowdhury, another lawyer representing the transport department, submitted that the receipts submitted by taxi owners, purportedly issued by Bhagwandas, were fake.        
	Responding to the petitioners contention that the state was acting unlawfully by charging a fee for the meter checks, Roy Chowdhury said: Since the government is providing a service, it has every right to charge a fee.        
	Mukhopadhyay said taxi owners did not want to abide by the notification as that would have scuttled their chances of tampering with the meters.        
	The matter will be heard again after four weeks.

	Pintu Saha, a 20-year-old guard, was arrested on Monday for killing his counterpart of a pathology units Bhowanipore office in January.        
	The alleged mastermind, Ranajit Mandal, also a guard who was once posted at the Bhowanipore office, and two other suspects are at large.        
	Police said Ranajit and Pintu had gone to the office on the night of 31 January with the intention of robbery but killed the guard, Sheikh Jamshed, as he knew them.        
	Pintu said the duo had expected around Rs 1 lakh in the cash box but found only Rs 1,200, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police of the detective department.        
	Jamsheds body was found in the office kitchen on February 1.        
	A probe revealed that Ranajit had worked for a private security agency that provided guards to the unit.        
	A new agency was appointed last year. Pintu worked for the new agency, said an officer.         
	On January 31, four people went to rob the place. Ranajit and Pintu sneaked in while the others stayed outside. The two took refuge in a toilet on the first-floor, said another officer. They pounced on Jamshed when he went to check the first floor. They pushed him into the kitchen and slit his throat.

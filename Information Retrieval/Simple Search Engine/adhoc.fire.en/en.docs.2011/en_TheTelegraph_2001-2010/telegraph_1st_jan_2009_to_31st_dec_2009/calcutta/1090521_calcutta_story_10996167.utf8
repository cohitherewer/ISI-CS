The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Turnout surge for rally at Writers
                                                                                                               Turnout surge for rally at Writers
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A protest march organised overnight by anti-CPM employees unions at Writers Buildings saw more than double the usual turnout on Wednesday.        
	Two days ago, the red bastion witnessed an unprecedented celebration by employees happy with the Trinamul Congresss performance in the Lok Sabha elections.        
	Rules allow state employees to organise protests at Writers only during the lunch break, from 1.30pm to 2pm. But Wednesdays demonstration continued from 1.40pm to 3.20pm.        
	The protest organised by the Mahakaran Sangram Committee  which includes the Trinamul-backed Federation of Secretariat Employees (Unified) and the Congress-supported Confederation of State Government Employees  without even putting up posters attracted about 450 participants.        
	Protests by anti-CPM organisations at Writers are usually preceded by weeks of campaigning and seldom attended by more than 200 employees.        
	We decided about the procession on Tuesday afternoon and hence, didnt find time to inform most of our supporters. But the turnout was impressive. Obviously, the polls results have influenced the headcount, said Sanket Chakrabarty, the secretary of the federation.        
	He, along with others, was protesting the delay in the implementation of the Fifth Pay Commissions recommendations and pressing for other demands. The Mahakaran Sangram Committee had agitated on the same issues earlier but failed to attract more than their band of faithful.        
	The latest round of agitation, however, saw fence sitters joining in.         
	Those who have so far shied away from pledging support to us joined the march, said Shyamal Mitra, the secretary of the confederation.        
	The Trinamul flag or green tilak was hard to miss as the procession started from G block on the third floor shortly after the chief minister left for lunch and wound its way through Writers.        
	Police watched from a distance, leaders scanned participants for new faces and many other employees, including members of the CPM-backed Coordination Committee, came out of their departments for a closer look.        
	The demonstration ended with a short meeting near the ground-floor library.        
	What about the protest stretching beyond the 30-minute lunch break?         
	Its different now. Change has started. We will raise the pitch of our protests and not bother about the time, said Moloy Mukhopadhayay, one of the protesters.

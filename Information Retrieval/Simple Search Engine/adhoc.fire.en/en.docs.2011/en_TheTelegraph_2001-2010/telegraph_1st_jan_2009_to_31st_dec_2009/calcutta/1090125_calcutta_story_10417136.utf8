The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Let there be more light
                                                                                                               Let there be more light

	Should there be special instructions on how to read an electric bill? (Yes.) Do you need to get a clearance from your landlord to get an electric connection? Should there be a special system to collect bills from slum areas? Should the bills need to be printed in Bengali or in languages other than English so that the consumers can follow them better? Will someone explain what is going on?         
	Questions such as these flew thick and fast at a meeting between electricity providers, including CESC, and consumers from different sections of society in the city. It was organised by international agency CUTS and a local NGO, called, well, EnGIO.         
	A lot of steam was let off. Much of it on the difficulty of reading the electricity bill. If only grudges could be converted into electricity. We pay a huge amount as a consumer but still find it difficult to understand the bill, complained Swami Lokeswarananda, the secretary of Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratishthan.         
	Someone should intervene, felt many. People regularly come to us with complaints about billing, fines, disconnected electricity lines and the problems of getting a new connection. Your people send us back on the slightest pretext, complained many residents from slum areas.         
	An intermediate social group  an NGO or a self-help group  should work as a facilitator, said councillor Debasish Kumar, a view shared by mayor-in-council Sushil Sharma.         
	Dilip Samajpati of CESC agreed. A similar model with NGOs has been implemented in Maharashtra, he said.         
	Let there be light. On bills.         
	Art mag        
	The economic downturn has not spared the art market and gallerists are going easy on bringing out lavishly produced catalogues and spending on frills that everybody was taking for granted.         
	The adversities notwithstanding, Akar Prakar took the bold step of launching its magazine on contemporary visual art, Varta, last Saturday evening at Oxford Bookstore. The first issue was devoted to art in eastern India, but as Reena Lath of Akar Prakar announced, the magazine would cover the pan-Indian art scene in later issues.         
	Nabaneeta Dev Sen, who was all praise for the masthead, and Ganesh Haloi were the guests of honour. The launch was followed by a panel discussion on the scope of art magazines. Art historian Tapati Guha Thakurta opened the discussion by stressing the responsibility of art writers in the present scenario, and spoke about the importance of magazines like Varta. Critic Samik Bandopadhyay said there should be a balance between visual support and the printed word, and art magazines should be like pleasure gardens. Adip Dutta, an artist and art teacher at Rabindra Bharati University, said art magazines should accommodate art that does not fall in any well-defined category. The launch attracted a surprisingly large gathering. Artists Veena Bhargav and Partha Pratim Deb, were quite vocal.         
	Lead sweetening         
	Winter is the time for the annual trip home for NRIs. At the end of one such stay in Calcutta, a young software engineer went back to work in her Chicago office. Thoughtfully she had carried a packet of kaju barfis for her firang colleagues. As they queued up for a taste of India, the inquisitive minds turned to the composition of the barfi. But they would not take cow milk for an answer. No, no. Cows are holy in India. Indians do not take cow milk, the American pundits nodded sagely.         
	Next, their attention turned to the tabak, the thin silver film atop the barfi. Whats that? By now, the 30-something was bristling with indignation. Lead, she shot back, the easiest way to poison you without drawing suspicion to myself.        
	They cleaned up the barfi packet fast.        
	Anger management        
	While driving down Karaya Road, a motorist noted a curious message painted on the rear of the vehicle ahead. Your anger, my pain. Treat me gently, it said. It bore the Calcutta police name and looked like a prison van. As the vehicle made its way into Karaya police station, one wondered whether the message came from the van itself and was meant for a stone-pelting mob. Or was it a heart-felt plea from the prisoners inside to lathi-wielding havildars?

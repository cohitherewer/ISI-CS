                      Contemporary strokes                    Despite being chosen at random, the five artists participating in New Fables, Contemporary Voices, the ongoing show of contemporary art, were born in the post-Nehruvian era. They grew up witnessing the major factors that brought the world on a equal plane  the coming down of the Berlin Wall, the effects of late capitalism, outsourcing, the effects of the global supply chain, and so on. Abir Karmakars pieces are sexually provocative, subverting the expectations of the masculine and the feminine, with a search for the other self or transgressive sexuality rendered in the very traditional medium of oil, thus reviving the genre. Chhatrapati Dutta uses a multitude of materials and effects that form his hallmark exuberant style, refusing to get bracketed with any single practice of art. Sunil Padwal chooses to treat his wooden surfaces as books that invite the audience to read, but in reality offers resistance owing to an impenetrable surface. His portraits, from which the eyes and mouths have been removed, create a strange disturbance in the minds of the audience. Chandra Bhattacharya and Iranna G.R. (a painting by the artist appears here) are among the others being showcased.                    Event: An exhibition of paintings by eminent artists When: Till September 8; 11 am - 7 pm Where: Gandhara Art Gallery, 18, Gurusaday Road, Flat 5A

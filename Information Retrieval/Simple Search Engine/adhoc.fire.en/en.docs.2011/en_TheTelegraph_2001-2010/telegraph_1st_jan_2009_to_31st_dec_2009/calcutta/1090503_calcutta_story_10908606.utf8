The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Next week you can be at ... Mukteswar 
                                                                                                               Next week you can be at ... Mukteswar 
                                                
	It was afternoon when we started for Mukteswar from Ramnagar, on our way back from Jim Corbett National Park. Mukteswar is a beautiful place in Uttarakhand in the upper regions of the Kumaon Hills.        
	Driver Satish took a short-cut and within a few hours we reached the Kaladhungi-Ramnagar highway. Jim Corbetts residence is in Kaladhungi, which has now been turned into a museum to Corbett.         
	Four kilometres off the highway is the 20-metre high Corbett Waterfall. Surrounded by dense forests, this place is quiet and blissful. The forest department has taken steps to develop transport services here to promote it as a tourist attraction.         
	Our car headed for Bhimtal after reaching Haldwani. A road by the side of a lake and a steep drive across a metalled road with several curves took us to Dhanachull.         
	Asking for directions from local people, we headed for Mukteswar since the entire stretch between Dhanachull and Mukteswar does not have a single milestone. Soon we reached Bhatelia. A steep drive through dense forests brought us in front of the Mukteswar Tourist Rest House.         
	At an altitude of 2,286 metres, Mukteswar is an ideal hill station surrounded by orchards and thick coniferous forests.         
	The lodge has 20 rooms that provide a panoramic view of the snow-capped peaks. The lobby offers a sight of the Nanda Kot, Trisul, Nanda Devi East, Panchchuli and Nanda Khat mountains.         
	In the morning, one can hear many kinds of birds if one takes a walk outside.         
	Mukteswar Temple is situated at an altitude of 2,315m. It can be reached by a flight of stone steps. The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva, though there are other idols surrounding the lingam.         
	The next attraction is chauli-ki-jali, a natural latticework on a rock. It provides a unique view of the entire valley and town. It is believed that a childless couple are blessed with a child if they touch this jali.         
	The mystery of the absent landmarks during our journey to Mukteswar was solved when we discussed the matter with the receptionist at our hotel. She said Mukteswar was put on the map by the Indian Veterinary Research Institute in 1898. Most local people were against Mukteswar becoming a popular destination, she said. They possibly didnt want such a beautiful place to be polluted by tourists, I felt. But I think the beauty of such a place should be shared.         
	Like all good things, our stay at Mukteswar came to an end. But the sight of a valley twinkling with lights under millions of stars is unforgettable.         
	Going         
	The nearest railway stations are Ramnagar, Lalkuan and Kathgodam. Roads are motorable. Mukteswar can be visited round the year. Heavy woollens are a must in winter.              
	Staying         
	Rooms can be booked at the Tourist Rest House in Mukteswar.

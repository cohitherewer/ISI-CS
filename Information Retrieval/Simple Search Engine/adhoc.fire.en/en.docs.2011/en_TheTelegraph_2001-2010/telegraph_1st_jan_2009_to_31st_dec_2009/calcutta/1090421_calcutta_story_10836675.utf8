The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Campaign stalls invade township
                                                                                                               Campaign stalls invade township
          TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                                                    (From top) Poll poster outside the CK market office; The CPM stall on a vacant plot in CF block; The Left Front shed on a footpath outside the AG block market      
	The CPM has set up campaign offices by encroaching on public and private land in Salt Lake and the authorities are allegedly looking the other way.        
	We have received complaints regarding illegal structures being set up in the township and have sent showcause notices to the CPM. We will visit the spots and demolish the structures, said Asoke Das, the Bidhannagar sub-divisional officer and assistant returning officer of Barasat constituency.        
	A drive by the election commission saw 847 illegal campaign materials being removed from the township on Saturday and Sunday. The illegal campaign offices were not demolished till Monday evening. The drive will continue on Tuesday.        
	Bidhannagar Municipality put the ball in the election commissions court. I havent heard of any such structures. It is the duty of the election commission to find out and take action if there has been any violation in Bidhannagar, said municipal chairman Biswajiban Majumder.        
	Metro drove through the township on Sunday evening and found CPM campaign offices on footpaths and vacant plots.        
	The Left Front has constructed a shed with bamboo and cloth on a part of the footpath outside the AG block market in Baisakhi. Cadres were busy at work in the makeshift office.        
	I first saw the structure last week when I came to the market. I fail to understand how the municipality can allow such an encroachment, said Nimai Dutta, a resident of the area.        
	Another makeshift office has been constructed on a vacant plot beside the CPM office in CF 204.         
	The firm erecting a building on the plot for the owner, who lives outside Calcutta, did not grant permission for the stall.        
	The party had informed us that it wanted to build an election office on the plot. I had said I would ask the owner but later found that the stall had come up, said an official of the firm.        
	The Bidhannagar Town Trinamul Congress has lodged a complaint with Das that the Bangiya Saksharata Prasar Samiti office of the Bidhannagar zonal committee outside the CK market was being used by the CPM for campaigning.        
	Cadres use the room to prepare for the elections. The office is not being used for its intended purpose, said a resident.        
	We have got the required permission to set up the structures. If the election commission considers them illegal, it can remove them, said Soumen Chakraborty, the head of the Salt Lake local committee of the CPM.        
	Chakraborty denied using the CK market office for election campaigning.        
	Sabyasachi Dutta, the president of Bidhannagar Town Trinamul Congress, said: The CPM is using several ward offices for election campaign but the authorities are not taking any action. The sub-divisional officer is only removing our campaign materials.

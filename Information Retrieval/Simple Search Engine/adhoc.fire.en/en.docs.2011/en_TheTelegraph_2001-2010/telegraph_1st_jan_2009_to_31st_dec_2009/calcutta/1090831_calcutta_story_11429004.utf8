                                                                                                               Fire scan on pandal
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Firemen inspected the Kasba RK Chatterjee Road Adhibasi Brinda pandal for over half an hour on Sunday afternoon.        
	Uday Adhikari, the divisional fire officer, said on Sunday: The puja organisers had sought fire safety clearance from us. Based on the findings of the two officers who inspected the pandal, we will let the organisers know by September 1 whether we will grant them fire clearance or not. If we dont issue a fire clearance we will let them know why.        
	The high court on Wednesday asked the puja organisers to demolish the illegal portion of the pandal within 24 hours following a petition by a resident.

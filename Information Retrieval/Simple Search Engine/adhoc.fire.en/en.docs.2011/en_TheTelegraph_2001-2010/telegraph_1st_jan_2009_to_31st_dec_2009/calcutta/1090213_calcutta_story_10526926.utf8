The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Youth in kidney racket net
                                                                                                               Youth in kidney racket net
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Raja Mukherjee, the 24-year-old son of suspected kidney racketeer Chandana Mukherjee, was arrested on Wednesday night from his Thakurpukur home.         
	According to police, he was in touch with the Delhi-based kingpin of the racket, Manik Chowdhury. Raja, whose mother was arrested on February 2, told the cops during interrogation that the racket had organised transplants in Chennai and Bangalore against hefty payments.         
	Raja came in touch with Manik through his mother a few years back. Manik tried to make him sell his kidney but he could not because of a tissue mismatch. The two went to other metros where the youth organised at least two transplants, said an investigator.        
	The police claimed that in the past few years, over 60 kidney transplants had been carried out at one of the three private hospitals under the scanner in the city. One of the hospitals allegedly had a system in place to find donors with the help of touts.        
	Some of the touts hailed from the Kadapara-Beleghata-Phoolbagan belt. We have failed to track them down, added the investigator.         
	Not everyone who donated their kidney for money joined the racket. It is difficult to gauge how many were involved in this business over the years. The hospitals are yet to provide all the documents. We need to scan them and then work out how the racket operated, said another officer.        
	Nine people have been held in connection with the racket, which was unearthed with the arrest of Mithun Chatterjee and Hriday Kumar Dubey at Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals on February 2.        
	Chandana, in her mid-40s, was arrested the same day. The cops said Manik used to stay in her flat every time he visited the city.

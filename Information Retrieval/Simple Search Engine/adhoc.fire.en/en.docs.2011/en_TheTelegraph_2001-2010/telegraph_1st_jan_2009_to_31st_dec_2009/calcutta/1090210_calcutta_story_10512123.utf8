The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Park or hooch den?
                                                                                                               Park or hooch den?
          ONTHESPOT - CHOWRASTA SISHU UDDYAN                        No takers for the swings inside Chowrasta Sishu Uddyan; (below) people drinking inside the park. Pictures by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya				                                       
	In the records of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), it is a childrens park but no child can play in it or take a turn at the swings that hang inside. For half of the park remains under water and the other half is covered in slush. Chowrasta Shishu Uddyan, in Behala Chowrasta, is now a liquor den and a resting place for passers-by.         
	The park was renovated two years back. It was maintained for a year after its renovation, said Manoranjan Das, a resident.        
	But a year back, a large water tank was built under the park. Since then water seeps out, turning the entire area slippery, said the owner of a shop in the locality.        
	After renovation, children used to regularly play in the park, she added.         
	Currently, long metal pipes remain stacked near an entrance of the park. The pipes will be used for a Calcutta Environment Improvement Project (CEIP), said a security guard at the park.        
	The parks gate facing Diamond Harbour Road remains open through the day, while the other remains shut. The area around the closed gate is inaccessible because it remains under water. There is a slip and a merry-go-round here.         
	According to residents, the park turns into a liquor den at night. This may also be a reason why parents dont send their children here, said Babulal Ghosh, who lives in the area.        
	Some residents claimed installation of lights in the park curbed the problem somewhat. Metro, however, found people drinking inside the park on the afternoon of February 7.        
	Besides, there are iron poles sticking out of the water tank, posing a threat to children. These poles are used to pull open the cover of the tank. But there is a good chance that these poles might hurt children playing in the park. Parents hence keep their wards off the park, said Ratna Majumdar, who had come to drop her child to a nearby school.        
	We dont see any children in the park nowadays. Only elders come here to spend time, she added.                     Pipes stacked at an entrace of the park		    
	Councillorspeak: There was no renovation work done here. We had only installed lights inside the park though there are plans of renovating it in the future. There is a boosting station adjacent to the park and water pipes from the station pass through the park. The slush is probably caused by leaks in those lines, said Ratna Roy Majumdar, the councillor of ward 128, under which the park falls.        
	A CEIP project is being undertaken on the adjacent road. The water accumulated inside the park cannot be released because of the work, Roy Mazumdar added.        
	She couldnt say when the work will be over and the water can be released.

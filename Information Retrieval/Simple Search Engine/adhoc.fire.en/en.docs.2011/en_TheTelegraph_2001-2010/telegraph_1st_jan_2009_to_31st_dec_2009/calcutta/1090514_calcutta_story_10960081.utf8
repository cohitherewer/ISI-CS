                                                                                                               That winning feeling after day of 250 calls
          MEGHDEEP BHATTACHARYYA                          Sen in queue to cast his vote in Salt Lake. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                  
	When chief electoral officer Debashis Sen woke up to the sound of his alarm clock buzzing to life at 5.45am on Wednesday, his first thought was: It is going to get really crazy now.        
	By 9pm, the busiest and most-sought-after man on polling day was also the happiest. When months of hard work pays off, you have had your reward. I would go through this every day for the winning feeling at the end, he told Metro as he headed back home.        
	Sens day in the spotlight had begun at 6.50am, when he left his residence at CE 81 in Salt Lake with wife Urmila for the polling booth at the CE Block Community Centre, 100-odd metres away. Television cameras rolled and photographers went click-click as Sen, in a crisp white cotton shirt, took his place in the queue.        
	It was 7.15am when the chief electoral officers turn came. He entered the booth and came out within five minutes, the index finger with the indelible ink mark raised to the cameras. I keep telling everyone to vote. I have to lead by example, he said before leaving for office, minus wife.        
	The spotlight then shifted to neighbour Ashish Chatterjee, a retired engineer who was just behind the chief electoral officer in the queue.        
	Do you know him (Sen)? a television reporter asked. Is he friendly with you? questioned another. We all know him well. He is a wonderful neighbour, replied the 69-year-old man.        
	Later, watching the footage on television in his BBD Bag office, Sen looked a little embarrassed. I become extremely self-conscious when I see such things; I will change the channel now, he smiled.        
	It was 11am and the calls had started streaming in. Keep me informed. Dont hesitate to call, he would tell the election officials and senior police officers who got through to either his cellphone or one of the three landline phones on his desk.        
	By the end of the day I will have surely received over 100 phone calls, he said.         
	Metro counted 250-odd calls by 9pm.        
	Lunch was served at 2.15pm  chicken biryani for the boss and his entire team. Sen finished his food in 20 minutes and left for a meeting with home secretary Ardhendu Sen. So far so good, he said before heading for Writers Buildings.        
	On his return at 3.30pm, he went into a huddle with his team, preparing a report for the Election Commission.        
	When he emerged from the room at 5pm, Sen had the look of a man who knew it was his day.

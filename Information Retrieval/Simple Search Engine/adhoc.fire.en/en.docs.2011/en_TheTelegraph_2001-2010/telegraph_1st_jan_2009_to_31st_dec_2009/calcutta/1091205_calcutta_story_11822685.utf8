	Birla Industrial and Technological Museum, along with the city branch of Aeronautical Society of India, organised an exhibition on aviation and space from November 19 to 22.         
	It included scale models of satellites, missiles, fighter aircraft, air navigation equipment and modern surveillance systems, displayed by participants like Airports Authority of India and Indian Space Research Organisation.         
	Representatives from each organisation were present to explain their exhibits. The air speed indicator is used while taking off and during landing, while the instrument landing system provides guidance to avoid a heavy landing, explained Abhishek Chatterjee, a student representative of Indian Institute of Aeronautical Science.        
	A miniature remote-controlled helicopter was the most popular with kids, with some taking turns to operate it. Students could also view Jupiter through a 10-inch telescope mounted in the evening.        
	Lectures organised on the sidelines of the exhibition included a talk by squadron leader Parveen Kumar on the Indian Air Force induction process and another by Aninda Mukherjee, who showed how youngsters could build and fly their own model aeroplanes.         
	B.R. Guruprasad, a scientist at the Indian Space Research Organisation, speaking about Indias first unmanned lunar probe, Chandrayaan 1, said: It established that the polar regions of the moon contain water molecules. Chandrayaan 2 will look for minerals, with rocket fuel on the top of the list.         
	Said Musfera Javed, a Class IX student of Our Lady Queen of the Missions School: The session was very enlightening. I never knew our country had achieved so much in the area of space research.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bomb scare at Metro station
                                                                                                               Bomb scare at Metro station
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A bomb-like object was spotted on the Tollygunge-bound tracks of Chandni Chowk Metro station on Thursday morning, spreading panic among commuters.        
	Metro officials alerted police and officers of Bowbazar police station and the bomb disposal squad arrived at the station with sniffer dogs. The cops cordoned off the area and inspected the object after power was cut off at 11.37am.        
	We found the object was paper wrapped in plastic with jute threads. Somebody may have dropped it there to play a prank, said an officer.         
	Metro services were hampered for half an hour from 11.32am. An Up train and three Down trains were cancelled. Normal services resumed at 12.04pm, said a Metro Railway spokesperson.        
	I got off the train and found the station teeming with policemen. They asked everyone to move out of the station as soon as possible. Announcements were being constantly made about services being stopped without explaining why, said a commuter whose office is on GC Avenue.

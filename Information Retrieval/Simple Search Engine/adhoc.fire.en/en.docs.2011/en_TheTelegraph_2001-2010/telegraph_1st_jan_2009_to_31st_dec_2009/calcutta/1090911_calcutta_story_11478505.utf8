The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Students fall ill on train
                                                                                                               Students fall ill on train
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	At least 25 students of Bijoykrishna Girls College in Howrah fell ill aboard the Ernakulam-Guwahati Express after drinking water collected from Chennai station.        
	The girls, who were vomiting and suffering from severe stomach upset since Wednesday morning, reached Howrah on Thursday afternoon. Some of them had to be administered saline on the train. The others were given medicines and ORS.        
	A railway medical team accompanied the students, part of a group of 39 that was returning from an educational tour.        
	A medical camp was also set up on platform 9 at Howrah station, where scores of anxious parents assembled before the train pulled in.        
	The students, who had boarded the train at Ernakulam in Kerala on Tuesday night, drank water and filled their bottles at Chennai station around 9am on Wednesday.        
	Most of them soon started feeling nauseous and suffering from stomach ache. Their condition worsened after they had lunch provided by the pantry car around noon.        
	Anaysa Bhattacharya, one of the students, said: Those who drank the water were vomiting and writhing on their bunks with stomach ache. With no doctors or medicines on the train, it was a terrifying experience.        
	The ticket examiners in the compartment alerted the railway authorities. A medical team boarded the train at Rajmandar station on Wednesday evening and started treating the girls. One of the doctors said the girls had drunk contaminated water.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | City vexed by viral fever
                                                                                                               City vexed by viral fever
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	A viral fever attack without the usual symptoms of the disease and lasting 8 to 12 days has stumped doctors and landed many in hospital.        
	The viral infection has spread rapidly over the past three weeks, afflicting both adults and children but affecting those with pre-existing lung diseases the most.        
	High fever often comes with rigor-like stiffness and headache. But most patients have no rashes on their bodies, unlike in a normal case of viral fever. Patients running a temperature for several days are being advised hospitalisation, said critical care specialist Subrata Maitra.        
	 Viral fever is usually accompanied by sore throat, congestion, body ache, diarrhoea, rashes and nausea.        
	The absence of joint pain and rashes in patients with high fever is leading doctors to suspect malaria or typhoid. If blood tests reveal that a patient had neither of these diseases, then the culprit is most likely this new bug, Maitra said.        
	In some children, the symptoms mimic the more serious Kawasaki disease. High fever with rashes that lead to the skin peeling off is causing panic, said Apurba Ghosh, the director of the Institute of Child Health. These are symptoms of the Kawasaki disease caused by a milder viral infection. The cardiac system of 40 per cent of children who have Kawasaki disease could be impaired. The virus we are dealing with is harmless in that respect.        
	But pulmonologists warn that viral fever can aggravate pre-existing lung diseases like asthma, bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Any viral fever can aggravate these chest conditions. So, people suffering from these diseases should avoid coming in contact with someone with a running nose or other symptoms of viral fever. They should constantly be on preventive medication, said Ashok Sengupta, consultant pulmonologist at Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals.        
	But whats helping this virus spread so rapidly?        
	According to doctors, warm weather and air pollution help the spread of viruses and bacteria. Even malaria, which usually does not occur at this time of the year, has made early inroads. We have diagnosed quite a few cases of malaria already, a pathologist said.

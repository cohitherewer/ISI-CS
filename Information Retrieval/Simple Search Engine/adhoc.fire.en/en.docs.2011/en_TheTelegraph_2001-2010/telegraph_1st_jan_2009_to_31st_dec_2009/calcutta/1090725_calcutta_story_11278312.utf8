The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Quizmaster Sourav takes guard
                                                                                                               Quizmaster Sourav takes guard
  - Cricket hero who grew up watching Q amp;A shows is learning on the job          PRATIM D. GUPTA                          Sourav Ganguly was unveiled as a quizmaster on Friday. (Aranya Sen)                                        
	Dadagiri: n amp; adj. Dadas primary occupation. Rising above the ordinary and exercising his right that makes his position difficult to challenge.        
	The word may not have made it to the Oxford English dictionary yet, but there was a lot of it on display on Friday afternoon as Dada the quizmaster was unveiled. Playing cricket is so much easier than hosting a show, admitted Sourav Ganguly, who embarks on a whole new innings from Monday on Dadagiri Unlimited (Zee Bangla).        
	Looking more relaxed than he has at any cricket-related meet in recent times, the 37-year-old in a red-and-white check shirt  full sleeves rolled up and top button open  was candid and cool. I had to run the show, create ideas, make the contestants comfortable. The only advantage was that I was allowed retakes! That would have suited some of his female guests just fine, those who clasped his hands and broke into an ode to Maharaj. It was so embarrassing, the Behala boy smiled shyly. But I am learning on the job, with every episode.        
	That Sourav must, for his contract with Zee is for three years  the one with Kolkata Knight Riders runs out in 2010  and the first year will see him carry his bat through 64 90-minute episodes.        
	For quizmaster role models, though, Sourav hasnt looked as far as KKR boss Shah Rukh Khan. I have watched Barry OBrien conduct so many.... Also, I used to watch Bournvita Quiz Contest (hosted by Derek OBrien) when I was young. Barry, on his part, feels the star has the right ingredients to make a great quizmaster if he allows the real Sourav to surface  a warm, friendly person with a St Xaviers education and lots of travelling.        
	Next, big screen? Rituda (Rituparno Ghosh) had offered me a film; thankfully I could get away as I was playing then. Now, with this show, the IPL and my school, my hands are full, smiled Sourav.

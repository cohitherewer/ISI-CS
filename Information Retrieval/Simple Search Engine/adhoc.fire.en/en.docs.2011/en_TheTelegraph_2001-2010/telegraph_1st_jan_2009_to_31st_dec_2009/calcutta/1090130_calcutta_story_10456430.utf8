The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cops blind to racing buses 
                                                                                                               Cops blind to racing buses 
                              A passenger boards a bus in the middle of the bridge in Ultadanga, ignoring a traffic sign stating that buses cannot halt there. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                            
	A day after a private bus mowed down two people at the Ultadanga-VIP Road crossing, Metro visited the spot to find that such an accident was waiting to happen. Here are the reasons              
	Bus-stop woes        
	There are a couple of bus stops near the crossing but few commuters know about them.        
	One is near the electric transformer at the crossing of Bidhannagar Road and VIP Road, while the other is at the VIP Road-end of Durgapur Bridge. But police have never tried to make it mandatory for passengers to use the bus stops.        
	Till four months ago, passengers bound for places along VIP Road or for Birati, Madhyamgram and Barasat would crowd at the foot of the bridge to board a bus. Speeding was common as buses raced to pick up passengers.        
	In the past few months, civic police volunteers have made the foot of the bridge at Ultadanga leading to VIP Road off limits for bus passengers. But that has compounded the problem as commuters now board the buses right in the middle of the bridge.        
	The passengers blame cops and bus drivers. We are forced to stand here as buses dont halt at the designated bus stops, said an angry Priyesh Jaiswal when asked why he was not using the bus stop.              
	Lack of infrastructure         
	A real estate boom in localities off VIP Road and in Birati, Madhyamgram and Barasat has led to an increase in public and private vehicles on this route. But the infrastructure has remained the same, including the length and width of the roads and pavements.        
	During peak hours, more than 1,500 vehicles try to negotiate their way within a radius of 500 metres from the foot of the bridge. The ongoing construction of a slip road connecting the EM Bypass and VIP Road has added to the load on the bridge, said a traffic sergeant on duty.        
	Another hurdle is the sorry state of the pavements on the bridge. They are not more than two-and-half feet wide and are broken at places. Hundreds of commuters jostle for space on these uneven strips at any given time.        
	People trip and hurt themselves on the pavements regularly. The movement of people is slow because of the narrow pavements, which creates bottlenecks at the mouth of the lane leading to the underpass. Bus drivers try to take advantage of the bottlenecks and pick up passengers from there. Repeated pleas to the Calcutta Municipal Development Authority to widen the pavements have fallen on deaf ears, said another cop.         
	Hawkers, too, have staked their claim on the pavements and even encroached on the road at some spots, shrinking the narrow passageway.                
	Missing cops         
	When Metro visited the Ultadanga crossing on Thursday, less than 24 hours after the fatal mishap on Wednesday night, no sergeant was in sight. Buses flouted speed limits with impunity and even autos and taxis were seen picking up passengers at the foot of the bridge.              
	Jaywalking        
	The lack of awareness among pedestrians is also responsible for accidents on this stretch.         
	On Thursday Metro observed that more than 50 per cent of commuters didnt use the footbridge at the crossing.         
	Many had no idea about the bus stops in the area. Every day we book 50-odd people for jaywalking, said a traffic cop on duty.                    ZEESHAN JAWED

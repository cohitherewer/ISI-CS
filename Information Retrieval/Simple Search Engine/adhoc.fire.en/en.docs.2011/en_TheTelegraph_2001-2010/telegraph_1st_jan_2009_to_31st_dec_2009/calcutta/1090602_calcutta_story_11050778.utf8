The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Probe grounds pilots
                                                                                                               Probe grounds pilots
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The pilots of the Calcutta-bound Jet Airways flight and the Air India plane that were on a collision course at Mumbai airport on Sunday have been grounded till the completion of an inquiry.        
	An official of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation said the investigation team had already spoken to the captains and co-pilots of the two aircraft and the air traffic control (ATC) personnel who were on duty at Mumbai airport on Sunday morning.        
	The team also checked the cockpit voice recorders of both aircraft and ran taped transcripts of the conversation between the pilots and the ATC personnel.         
	The four pilots have been de-rostered pending the inquiry. Apparently, the Air India pilots were at fault but a conclusion can be drawn only after the probe is over, a DGCA official confirmed from Delhi.        
	A possible collision endangering the lives of 224 passengers on board the two aircraft  the Air India plane was bound for Shanghai via New Delhi  was barely averted when the pilots aborted take-off from intersecting runways at 7.55am on Sunday.        
	The DGCA, however, claimed that there was no chance of a collision. The two aircraft had stopped quite a distance from each other, a spokesperson said.         
	Jitender Bhargava, the executive director of corporate communications at Air India, said pilots being de-rostered did not mean they were at fault. De-rostering of pilots is a routine exercise after any incident and is meant to help the investigation. Our air safety wing is working in co-ordination with the DGCA, Bhargava added.        
	A Jet Airways official blamed the close shave on the Air India pilots. He said ATC personnel had given 9W 615, with 116 people on board, clearance for take-off when pilots realised that AI 348 was also speeding down an intersecting runway.        
	When the two planes stopped, less than 200 feet separated them, witnesses said.

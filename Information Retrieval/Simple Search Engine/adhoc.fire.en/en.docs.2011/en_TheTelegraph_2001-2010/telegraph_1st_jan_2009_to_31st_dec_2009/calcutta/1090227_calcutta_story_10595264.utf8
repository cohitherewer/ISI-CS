										      TT for City - Graffiti Battle                                      
	A day after the Election Commission bowed to political pressure and announced a relaxation in the blanket ban on graffiti for the general elections, the chief electoral officer (CEO) of Bengal, Debashis Sen, reads the houseowner his rights and promises protection.                 
	Q: I dont want to give permission but fear backlash from political goons. What are my options?        
	A: Dont give permission if you do not want to. The election commission clearly states that under no circumstances can anyone be forced or intimidated on the issue of defacement of buildings. The commission and the election cell of Calcutta police will protect anyone facing intimidation in any form. We have introduced a 24-hour helpline (9830079999) of the Calcutta police election cell, where citizens can lodge their complaints in complete confidentiality.        
	The commission and the police are there to support you if you are unwilling. So we strongly recommend that you do not give consent in writing unless you support the cause. There is very little we can do once you have given your permission in writing.        
	Q: I dont give permission but I wake up one morning to find graffiti on my walls. What can I do?        
	A: Promptly report the matter to your local police station, the returning officer (RO) and the central observer (CO). Immediate action will be taken to redress your grievance, thats a promise. The ROs and the COs will assume charge in respective constituencies within two weeks of the poll announcement.        
	Q: How do I ensure that the graffiti is easily removable and the walls are restored to their original hue?         
	A: You must get a written undertaking before you give your consent in writing. The commission has urged the parties to desist from painting walls and to use banners, flags and posters instead, which are easily removable. You must insist on the same.        
	Q: What do I do if the party does not restore the walls after the poll process is over? For how long am I supposed to wait?        
	A: The rules are slightly vague in this regard. They should ideally start restoring the wall as soon as the voting is over, even before the counting process and should not take more than a few days.         
	But I must reiterate, if you care enough for the appearance of the walls and your building, please do not give consent.        
	Q: Why did the election commission side with the political parties instead of the people on this count?         
	A: The commission has to walk a tightrope in striking a delicate balance between the civil and political sections of society.        
	Q: What can I as a citizen do to help the election commission put an end to the menace of wall graffiti?        
	A: The commission seeks to help citizens to stand up for their rights without fear. As citizens you have duties too. You must meet and network with like-minded people. You can organise meetings in the neighbourhood and form support groups to be able to stand up for your rights. Do not, under any circumstances, be forced into doing anything against your will.         
	We have seen instances of the might of the common man when he stands firm and united to safeguard his rights and I am certain that as citizens of this great city you are capable of the same.

                      From spotlight to stamp                    Always an important centre of artistic and intellectual endeavour, Bengal has produced some of the best works in cinema during the last century. Bengali cinema has carved its very own niche in the world of moving pictures, boasting a number of award-winning movies, internationally-acclaimed filmmakers, scriptwriters, actors, playback singers, musicians, photographers and other technicians. Cinema and Allied Arts of Bengal in the Courtyard of Philately, the ongoing exhibition of stamps, presents a study of Bengali cinema from its advent in 1898 till the present day, albeit with several discontinuities. The main aim of this presentation is to draw more and more people to the fascinating world of philately and create an atmosphere of friendship and fraternity through this unique and interesting hobby. Apart from philatelic material, the collection on display includes some rare non-philatelic memorabilia that hold special value to all cinema lovers. Among them is a still photograph of Satyajit Ray with the 12th Palden Thondup Mamgyal and his wife Hope Cooke, shot during filming of Rays controversial documentary Sikkim in 1971. Also, an original advertisement booklet of the film, Mahanisa (1936), picture postcards of Rays Pather Panchali (a still from the film appears here) and rare picture postcards of yesteryears theatre personalities and an original VCD stamp. Hosted by Russian Centre of Science and Culture in Calcutta and Forum for Philately.

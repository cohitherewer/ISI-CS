The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Aila effect on ecology
                                                                                                               Aila effect on ecology
          JAYANTA BASU                          An uprooted tree on Southern Avenue                                  
	Scientists are pondering over the Aila impact on the citys environment.        
	Around 1,500 large trees were uprooted and more than 2,500 smaller ones badly damaged while the cyclone went past the city.        
	Forest department sources said the trees that bore the brunt of the impact included krishnachura, radhachura, raintree, shirish, kadam, jarul, mango, chatim and pine.        
	The environmental value of these trees is huge, as they played a key role in carbon absorption, providing oxygen, arresting particulate pollution and maintaining biodiversity, said Aniruddha Mukherjee, the head of the environment science department at Calcutta University.        
	The commercial value of the trees is no less either. The timber of krishnachura and radhachura are mainly used as fuel but kadam is widely used in low-cost furniture. Jarul, shirish and pine are used in costlier furniture, said Arunendu Banerjee, an architect and environment expert.        
	The commercial value of most felled trees should be high as they were old and had reasonably large girth.        
	A medium-sized mango tree in the Ballygunge Science College compound fell on Monday. The price of the tree has been fixed at Rs 17,000, said an official.        
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has decided to keep the uprooted trees in its parks till they are sold off.        
	Faiyaz Ahmed Khan, the mayoral council member in charge of parks and gardens, said it would take at least another week to completely remove all the felled trees.         
	The green disaster has prompted the forest department to revise its planting-cum-management strategy.        
	The roots of most trees in the city cannot fully develop for lack of space. As a result, big trees with large canopies, such as krishnachura, do not gain stability and tend to fall even in a moderate storm, said Somenath Mukherjee, a senior official in the forest department looking after urban forestry.         
	The department, he said, is considering planting trees that grow to 10-15 feet and have less canopy. We will also have to decide on the upkeep of existing large trees. On Southern Avenue alone, at least 30 trees are in the danger of being uprooted if another storm strikes the city, said Mukherjee.

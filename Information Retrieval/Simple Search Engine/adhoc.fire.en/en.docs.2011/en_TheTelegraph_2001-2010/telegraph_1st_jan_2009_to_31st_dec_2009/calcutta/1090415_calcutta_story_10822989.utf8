	A member of the gang that had killed the guard of an apparel store in Kamarhati in January and fled with Rs 137,000 was arrested in Ranchi on Monday night.        
	Police said Jaiprakash Singh, 22, was the third member of the gang to be arrested Subodhkant Singh, 38, and Mohammed Rahim Sheikh, 35, were held recently in Jharkhand. Cops said Subodhkant was the gang leader and had fired at the guard.        
	They were also involved in two bank robberies in Baguiati and Madhyamgram and an attempted robbery in Kharda, said an officer. The gang had six members, all residents of Jharkhand, and a search is on for the other three.        
	Police said Subodhkant was a Hindi movie buff and drew inspiration from films on bank heists. He even mentioned a Hindi film where three blind men rob a bank, said the officer.

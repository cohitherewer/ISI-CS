The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | City scorched by heat wave
                                                                                                               City scorched by heat wave
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Roadside relief: Three youths cool themselves on a city street on Sunday. (Amit Datta)                                   
	A heat wave has set the city on the boil and there is no immediate respite in sight.        
	If Calcuttans were looking forward to sundown for some relief, their hopes were scorched by prolonged power cuts across town.        
	The mercury on Sunday soared to 41.2 degrees Celsius, five degrees above normal, crossing the 40-degree mark two days in a row in April for the first time since 1980. On Saturday, the maximum temperature was 40.8 degrees.        
	For a hot spell to be declared a heat wave, the maximum temperature must be at least five degrees above normal, and the condition should prevail for a while.        
	Sunday was the hottest April day in Calcutta since April 25, 1980, when the mercury had risen to 41.7 degrees Celsius. The discomfort index on Sunday touched 64.8 degrees Celsius, 10 degrees above normal.        
	Going by the weathermans prediction, there is little chance of relief from the sweltering spell in the next 24 hours. The heat wave will continue in isolated places in Gangetic Bengal in the next 24 hours, said D.N. Talapatra, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre, Alipore.        
	A strong anticyclonic formation over Rajasthan and its neighbourhood is causing the incursion of dry, hot winds in the form of northwesterlys and westerlys. This, coupled with low moisture content in the lower troposphere, has resulted in the intense heat, he added.        
	Doctors said many Calcuttans were falling victim to the excessive heat. People are being admitted with heat exhaustion, diarrhoea, hepatitis and fever, said critical care expert Subrata Maitra.        
	Heat exhaustion, an initial stage of heat stroke, manifests itself through weakness, fatigue and a drop in blood pressure. One should avoid outdoor activities as much as possible and drink plenty of fluid to prevent dehydration. People should also try not to eat or drink at roadside stalls to avoid being afflicted with gastrointestinal ailments, said Maitra.        
	Of the patients turning up at various gastroenterology clinics in the city, many are complaining of pain in the kidney or urinary bladder. Crystals are formed in kidneys and urinary bladders because of inadequate intake of fluid in extreme heat. If left untreated, these crystals can grow into stones, said surgical gastroenterologist Sanjay De Bakshi.        
	Some Calcuttans wilting under the solar assault flocked to Nicco Park for some relief, though temporary. Todays footfall was over 7,000 and the water park was packed to capacity, said Partho Chatterjee, the deputy manager (marketing) of Nicco Park.

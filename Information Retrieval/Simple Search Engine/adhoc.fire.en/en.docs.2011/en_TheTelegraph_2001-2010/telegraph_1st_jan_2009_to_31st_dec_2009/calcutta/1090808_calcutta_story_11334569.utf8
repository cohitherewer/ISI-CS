The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 3 vehicles seized
                                                                                                               3 vehicles seized
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Three old, polluting commercial vehicles were impounded in the city on Friday, taking the number of seizures in the first week of the phase-out drive to 20.        
	An over 15-year-old taxi was intercepted at Gariahat by a joint team of police and the motor vehicles department.        
	Cops also impounded a three-wheeled goods carrier at the Park Circus seven-point crossing and a van in the Beniapukur area for violating the high court ban.        
	On August 1, the first day of the phase-out drive, 1,700 policemen were deployed to impound vehicles violating the age bar.        
	Since bus owners and organisations of commercial vehicle operators had announced that they would not ply their vehicles, we decided to reduce the number of policemen on the road. On Friday, 500 policemen were deployed to carry out the drive, said a senior officer at Lalbazar.

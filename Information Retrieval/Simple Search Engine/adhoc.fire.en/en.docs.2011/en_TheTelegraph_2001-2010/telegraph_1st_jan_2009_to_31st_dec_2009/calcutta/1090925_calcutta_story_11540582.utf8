The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Get set, go for festive flow
                                                                                                               Get set, go for festive flow
                                          
	A Metro guide to the Saptami rituals and revelry.              
	What is todays puja?        
	The days rituals include the bathing of the Nabapatrika (collection of nine plants), its installation beside Ganesha and the bathing of a mirror that reflects the Goddesss image (mahasnan).        
	The rituals have to be completed by 8.28am says the Gupta Press almanac and 8.29am says the Bisuddhasiddhanta almanac.         
	Pushpanjali will follow the completion of the puja.        
	Saptami is on till 10.31pm (Gupta Press) and 9.14pm (Bisuddhasiddhanta).              
	Where to go?        
	Today will be less crowded than Ashtami and Navami. So, head for the more chaotic crowd-puller pujas in south Calcutta, from Behala to Jadavpur to Kasba.              
	How to go?        
	Metro Railway is your best bet. Metro will ply from 2pm to midnight on Saptami  at 15-minute intervals 2pm to 4pm, 10-minute intervals 4pm to 11pm, 15-minute intervals 11pm to midnight.         
	If you have to drive, find out about the no-parking zones and one-way rules. Leave your cell number on your vehicle so that traffic cops can contact you in case your car needs to be moved. (Risking crank callers is better than risking your car being pushed around or towed away.)              
	What to wear?        
	Tie-and-dye ghera kurtas paired with colourful leggings for the girls  yes, a la Deepika Padukone in Love Aaj Kal  and waistcoats for the guys.              
	What to eat/drink?        
	Experiment with culinary truths before going all traditional on Ashtami. So, head for a restaurant that you have never been to before  and not for a Bangali bhoj. A dry day (Ashtami till 3pm) lurks around the corner, so you cant be blamed for drinking like there is no tomorrow.                 
	Worth a watch:        
	Sovabazar Rajbari puja, started by Raja Nabakrishna Deb in 1757 and attended by Lord Clive as thanksgiving for victory in the battle of Plassey. Traditional in look and spirit.                 
	Worth a miss:        
	Theme pujas. Its demand and supply; you stop demanding and they will stop supplying those outlandish themes in the name of creativity.

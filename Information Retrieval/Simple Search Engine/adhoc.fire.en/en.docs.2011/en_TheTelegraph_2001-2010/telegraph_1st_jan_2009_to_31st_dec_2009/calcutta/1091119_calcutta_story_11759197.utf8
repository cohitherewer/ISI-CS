The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rivals neck and neck in roadhog race 
                                                                            Thursday , November 19 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Rivals neck and neck in roadhog race 
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                                            
	The CPM has narrowly beaten the Trinamul Congress in encroaching city thoroughfares by erecting party offices, according to a list drawn up by the civic body.         
	Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharayya, after failing to remove hawkers encroaching on most city roads, directed his officials to draw up the list.         
	According to him, political parties and a section of their leaders are the main reasons why motorists and pedestrians cannot move freely on the city roads.         
	How can the civic body remove hawkers from roads and pavements when the three major political parties have built offices encroaching roads and public land? asked the mayor.        
	Any demand for action against encroachment of roads and pavements by hawkers can have meaning only if the political parties pull down their illegal offices first, he added.         
	A senior civic official said the list includes 66 offices  26 belonging to the CPM, 24 to the Trinamul and 16 to the Congress.        
	The figures represent only the tip of the iceberg, he added. If less important roads and lanes and defunct deep tubewell pump houses are taken into account, the number of illegal party offices will rise to nearly 600.        
	The mayor feels stern action cannot be taken against illegal encroachment in the city unless there is a political consensus.        
	I will appeal to the councillors to take up the matter with their party bosses so that the illegal offices can be pulled down, said the mayor.         
	Hawkers are pleased at the shift in focus to politicians. We congratulate the mayor for realising that it is not the hawkers but the politicians and the police who have left the city is in such a bad shape, said the leader of the Hawker Sangram Committee, Shaktiman Ghosh.         
	The leader of the civic Opposition, Javed Ahmed Khan, called Bhattacharyyas bluff. The mayor is fooling the people. He is talking of an all-party consensus for removing hawkers from the thoroughfares but he never sought an all-party consensus while allowing the hawkers to settle on the pavements, said Khan.         
	We have doubts about the list of illegal party offices prepared by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. If the mayor was transparent and honest, he should have requested each councillor to provide a list of illegal offices of his rival parties in his area, added the Opposition leader.

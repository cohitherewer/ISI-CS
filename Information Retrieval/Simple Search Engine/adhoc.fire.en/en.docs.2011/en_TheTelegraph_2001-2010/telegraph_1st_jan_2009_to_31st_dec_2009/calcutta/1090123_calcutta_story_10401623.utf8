The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Whats in a name? Ask namesake
                                                                                                               Whats in a name? Ask namesake
  - Doctor doesnt mind sharing Dharmendras identity from Bolly laugh riot          SANJAY MANDAL                              Parimal Tripathy (Amit Datta); Dharmendra in Chupke Chupke				                                       
	He is dapper but does not quite look like Dharmendra used to 33 years ago. He is a man of science but not a professor of botany. He has a sense of humour but he certainly did not disguise himself as a driver to prove a point to his wife.        
	Meet Parimal Tripathy, not the iconic character in the riotous Hrishikesh Mukherjee comedy Chupke Chupke but a leading neurosurgeon in town.        
	All my family members and friends are aware of the strange coincidence. A number of patients tell me, Sir, I have watched your film!, smiles Tripathy, the head of the neurosurgery department at Bangur Institute of Neuroscience and Psychiatry.        
	The 57-year-old is a fan of his reel-life counterpart. I have watched the film a number of times and I love it every time, he admits. And that is quite often. For whenever his film is being shown on some channel, daughter Sayanti, a university student, wants him to be in front of the television.        
	So what character traits does he share with his namesake from the 1975 film? If Allahabads Parimal Tripathy was an ace singer, the MBBS from Chittaranjan National Medical College is not out of tune, either. I sing at family gatherings and people say my voice is not bad, he smiles.        
	Just like his screen avatar, our very own Parimal Tripathy digs both food (I like trying out different cuisine) and food for thought (I love my adda sessions with friends). And while he may not be the prankster that Dharmendras Parimal Tripathy-turned-Pyaremohan Allahabadi was, the good doctor does believe in laughter being a vital medicine.        
	Patients with neurological disorder are quite critical and they are often apprehensive in front of the doctor. So, a bit of humour or a joke can put them at ease and help them open up.        
	Thats when having a name like Parimal Tripathy helps.

                                                                                                                 We Ask You Answer      Necessary and noxious evil
          Todays question: Are you riding polluting two-stroke autorickshaws? More responses will be published next week                                                      
	K.K. Chowdhury, 
  Kazi Para Road									      
	I think most of the autorickshaws are two-stroke ones and people will ride them because they are the easiest and most cost-efficient means of commuting. Besides, it is the duty of the police and the Route Transport Authority to see that two-stroke autos are banned. Drastic action is necessary to stop them.               
	

KAJAL CHATTERJEE, 
  Sodepur         
	I have vowed not to ride two-stroke autorickshaws. If the administration fails to implement the law, the onus rests on the common man. The least we can do is to refrain from riding them.               
	

Diptimoy De, 
  Barisha        
	Normally, flouting a prohibitory order is a common practice in West Bengal. So, even after the high courts order in July I did not turn away from the autos. The action against the offending autos started from January 1. Then I thought that for a change, I should abide by the order. By not taking two-stroke autos I can improve the air quality in my locality, however infinitesimally.               
	

MEGHDUT PAL, 
  Kestopur         
	I ride autos only in dire need but I feel that I should not.              
	

Biplaab Paul,
  Dankuni        
	People are unaware of the difference between two-stroke and four-stroke autos. They only want to reach their destination on time, so they ride them. I appreciate the courts order and the governments step of banning two-stroke autos. If any substitute is available we will take it.               
	

P.B. SAHA,
  Salt Lake         
	Nobody would like to drink poison knowingly. Passengers are compelled to ride autos as they are easily available. Its useful to office-goers, who have to reach on time. I ask drivers if they have changed to LPG-fuelled engines before I ride an auto. I look for an alternative mode of transportation if its not running on LPG. It is possible for me because I have retired.               
	

Anindya Kundu, 
  NK Ghosal Road         
	Has anybody said that this mode of transport has been banned in the city? The only requirement is to use cleaner fuel so that emissions from them do not poison the environment. But in the next phase, if at all we see a switchover to LPG, there will surely be reports of autos using subsidised cooking gas instead of queuing up at LPG outlets. These Leftists have taught more than one generation to discard moral values and fulfil their own interests.              
	Tapan Pal,
  Batanagar         
	It is not my duty to stop mobile chimneys from plying. I cough up grey mucus every afternoon for them but I cough up tax as well, to maintain people to do such odd jobs.      
	NIVEDITA DUTTA,
  Lalkuthi   
	The auto owners and the government are clueless about how to turn two-stroke autos into LPG ones. They lack the necessary infrastructure. So, I am riding two-stroke autorickshaws.           
	H. ROY CHOWDHURY, 
  Ballygunge Station Road         
	Yes, I am still riding two-stroke autorickshaws. When the focus is on cost, comfort and travel time, and not on rash driving, flouting of traffic rules and air pollution, then autorickshaws are the best option. Moreover, it is practically impossible to tell a two-stroke auto from a four-stroke one during office time.              
	

D.P. Bhattacharya, 
  Sonarpur        
	I am helpless in avoiding autorickshaws. Violent protests by auto unions backed by political parties have slowed the pace of the phase-out of polluting autos. But keeping in mind the air pollution, instead of quarrelling with each other over political gain, all parties should come together and help implement the high court directive.                Ritwik Das, 
  Address not mentioned        
	I think as responsible citizens we should boycott the autos as they are the root cause of air pollution in the city. Most of them are ruthless drivers who create a menace on the streets, disrupting traffic. We should make them feel that the city can commute without autorickshaws. So I am not riding an auto.              
	Subhamay Karmakar, 
  Dum Dum         
	It is a shame to see people running to catch an auto all the time.The court and the environmentalists are doing their job. Its our turn now.            Asit Kusari,
  Tollygunge   
	I have joined the small brigade of auto-avoiders. It is my personal way of making a difference. I know that if I take a bus instead, I will reach my destination later than usual. It will also be a more crowded ride. But the positives of avoiding autos are too many.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Lawyers in illegal sale of govt plot
                                                                                                               Lawyers in illegal sale of govt plot
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Police have stumbled upon the illegal sale of a government plot for Rs 2 crore, following the arrest of six men, including two lawyers, on Sunday.        
	These six and two other lawyers had illegally sold a CMDA plot in Mahestala, claiming that it was private property, to a group of nine businessmen for Rs 2 crore, Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police (detective department) said on Monday.        
	The six in the net have been identified as Lalmohan Basu and Gaur Das Jana (both lawyers), and Ajit Majumdar, Ramchand Yadav, Dipak Ghose and Dilip Ghose.        
	The two other lawyers who the police said were part of the racket were Brojo Pal and Atanu Pal.        
	Apprehending arrest, the Pals surrendered before court and obtained interim bail. We will move an appeal for the cancellation of bail, said an investigating officer.        
	A probe revealed that the four lawyers, in collusion with Dipak and Dilip, had hatched a plot to sell 2 acres of a vacant plot in Mahestala, on the southern fringes of the city, which the CMDA had acquired in 2005.        
	Ajit and Ramchand, who are land-brokers, showed the plot to the businessmen in mid-2008. They also introduced Dilip and Dipak to the businessman as the co-owners of the land, the officer said.        
	After a week they called up the prospective buyers to Alipore court, where they were introduced to Lalmohan, Gaur, Brojo and Atanu. The four lawyers gave them some fake papers to back the brokers claim that the plot was owned by Dilip and Dipak.        
	The lawyers told the businessmen that many buyers had already approached them. They asked them to strike a deal immediately or the plot would be sold to others, said the officer.         
	After the deal was struck, the racketeers produced some more fake papers, including a purported will of the plot and some related documents.        
	The lawyers had also prepared a document on a stamp paper declaring Dilip and Dipak as the owners of the plot, said another officer.        
	It was only in October that the businessmen learnt that they had been duped into buying a government plot.        
	They lodged a complaint with the special cell of the detective department in November.        
	We are trying to find out whether more people were involved in the scam, the officer added.

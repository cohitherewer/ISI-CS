                                                                                                               Murder on Metro stairs
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The entrance to Kavi Nazrul where Surinder was shot. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                  
	A young man was fatally shot on Metro Railways doorstep on Sunday evening, triggering panic among passengers who mistook the gunshots outside Kavi Nazrul (Garia Bazar) station for a terror attack.        
	Surinder Bharti, 32, was about to enter the station from the Garia Canal Side Road entrance around 5pm when the assailant fired twice from a countrymade gun, aiming first at his head and then his chest.         
	As Surinder slumped on the stairs, passengers entering or exiting the station thought their worst fears had come true. I had just stepped out of the platform when I heard gunshots. My first reaction was: God, we have been attacked, recalled Garia Bazar resident Pinaki Saha.         
	It took more than a couple of minutes for Pinaki and the other passengers to realise what had actually happened, by which time the assailant and his accomplice had fled leaving the gun behind.        
	Witnesses said the duo entered the ground level of the station through the same entrance that Surinder was taking and ran out of the one on the opposite side.        
	Security personnel inside Kavi Nazrul were apparently clueless about the murder  the first such incident in a Metro station  until someone told them about the commotion outside.        
	Some members of a local club chased the assailant, 22-year-old Bihar resident Pankaj Lala, and caught up with him in a nearby lane even as Surinder was being taken to a private nursing home in Garia, where he died.        
	Officers at Sonarpur police station said Jharkhand resident Surinder was possibly the victim of a revenge killing. We have learnt that Pankaj and his accomplice were waiting for Surinder in front of the Metro station since 3pm. The duo were seen having lunch in a roadside eatery and drinking alcohol from soft drink bottles, said an investigator.         
	Surinders sister-in-law Billu Tudu told the police that the victim came to the city along with his family three months ago. She told us that he was a contractor in Jharkhand and was killed because of business rivalry. We are trying to verify the information, the investigator said.        
	Subhankar Sinha, the additional superintendent of police (rural) in South 24-Parganas, said a manhunt had been launched for Pankajs accomplice. We have started a murder case, he added.

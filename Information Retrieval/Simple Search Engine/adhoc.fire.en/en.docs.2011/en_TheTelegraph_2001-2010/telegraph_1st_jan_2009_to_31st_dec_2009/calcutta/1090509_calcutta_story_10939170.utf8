                      Towards a fair change                    Poverty, climate change and economic crisis are the three major problems affecting the world today. While conventional trade and development sectors are looking for new value systems and structures to deal with the changing realities of the world, the concept of Fair Trade had set out an alternative agenda long ago. It had shown how holistic and inclusive trade-driven development and empowerment could take place by pursuing the path of justice, equity, choice, human development and cooperation. Fair Trade is a unique development paradigm where business and trade blend with the delivery of social goods by capacity building of the marginalised producer and creating informed consumers. The concept advocates connecting the ends of the supply chain directly and transparently together so as to improve the quality of sustainable products and services. Promoting a relationship based on transparency, growth and innovation, it sits at the heart of a healthy economic culture. To mark World Fair Trade Day today, Fair Trade organisations in the city have joined hands with Fredskorpset Indian Partners Network to host a week-long series of events focusing on Fair Trade and its relevance in the world today. May 9 amp; 10: Beating of traditional drums along with display of posters and banners (at Mohor Kunj and Dakshinapan); May 9 - 15: Exhibition of handicrafts, textiles, natural bodycare and food items (at Sasha Shop and Silence); May 9 - 15: Exhibition of photographs on human struggles and triumph over adversity (at Gaganendra Pradarshashala); May 11: Screening of short films along with interaction with filmmakers (at ICCR, 9A Ho Chi Minh Sarani); May 15: Seminar on Fair Trade  a Solution to Poverty, Economic Crisis and Climate Change (at ICCR, 9A Ho Chi Minh Sarani).

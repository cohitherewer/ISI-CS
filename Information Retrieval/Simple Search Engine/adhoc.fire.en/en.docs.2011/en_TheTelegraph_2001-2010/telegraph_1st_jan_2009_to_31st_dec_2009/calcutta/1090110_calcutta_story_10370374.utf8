The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Petrol pumps still dry
                                                                                                               Petrol pumps still dry
  - Normal supply to resume after a day or two          OUR BUREAU                          The owner of a petrol pump near Jadavpur police station blocked the entry on Friday to let in only one vehicle at a time. Picture by Pradip Sanyal                                        
	The strike called by officials of 13 oil companies on Tuesday has been called off, but owners of petrol pumps said the situation would not normalise before a day or two.        
	The nationwide strike had led to around 70 per cent pumps in the city drying up.        
	Some of the pumps run by BPCL and Indian Oil got their stocks replenished during the day but No Entry or Out Of Stock boards could still be spotted in front of more than 350 refilling stations.         
	I saw on television that the strike was over. But when I went to a pump I was asked to wait at least till tomorrow afternoon to refill the tank, Subhadeep Majumdar, a resident of Golf Green, said while coming out of Prince Service Centre near South City Mall.         
	Tushar Kanti Sen, the president of the West Bengal Petroleum Dealers Association, said special measures were being taken to speed up supply to the pumps that went dry after tankers stopped rolling out of depots in Mourigram, Haldia, Budge Budge and Rajbandh.        
	All oil depots will remain open on weekends to clear the backlog. The petrol stations across the state, too, will operate on Saturday and Sunday nights, said Sen.         
	Amiya Mukherjee, the deputy manager (production) at Indian Oils Haldia refinery, said loading and supply of fuel would normalise by Saturday afternoon. It will take our machines seven to eight hours to resume production.         
	Officials of Indian Oil, which runs more than half the pumps in the city, were the last to call off the strike. Normal work at the companys Haldia refinery resumed at 8pm.        
	The decision to call off the strike came as a relief to the state government, which had called an emergency meeting on Thursday morning to tackle the crisis that led to long queues at petrol pumps and a drop in the number of public and private vehicles on the streets.         
	To counter panic buying, the main reason for the pumps going dry, the government and the pump owners decided to ration refuelling of vehicles.         
	A meeting chaired by chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti imposed a cap of 10 litres for cars, 15-20 litres for taxis, 40 for minibuses and 50 for buses.         
	But Metro found on Friday afternoon that most pump owners were unaware of the decision.         
	There was a practical problem, too, in enforcing the ceiling. It is impossible to identify a customer who has already taken his quota of 10 litres from another pump, said Jayanta Bhattacharya, of an HPCL pump on Park Street.         
	A meeting at Writers on Saturday afternoon will review the rationing decision, said a member of the state petroleum dealers association.

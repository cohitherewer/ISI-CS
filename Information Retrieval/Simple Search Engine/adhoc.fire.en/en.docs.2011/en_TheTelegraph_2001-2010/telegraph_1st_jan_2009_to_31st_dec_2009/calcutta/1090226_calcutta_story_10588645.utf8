                      Inspired by nature                     For centuries, artists have been fascinated by the natural landscape which has served as a favourite subject in their works. The pleasures and beauty of nature also act as a counterbalance to the tensions of modern city life. Tanima Bhattacharya feels that personal contact with nature is a way to refresh the spirit and regain contact with a greater scheme of things. To her, nature is a storehouse of moral and spiritual truths and provides a cradle for nurturing human activity. The Essence of Life, the ongoing second solo exhibition of her paintings, features 16 recent works that portray the intrinsic beauty and harmony of nature. The amazing and colourful variety of animals and birds to be found in the lap of nature dominates her canvases. Mainly done in watercolours, wash and tempera, they express a fundamental unity with nature which city-bred mortals have lost. Another important theme handled by the artist is the constancy and continuity of nature with respect to time. Unlike human beings, who have modified and adapted their way of life as demanded by the changing times, nature continues to flow in its own rhythm, irrespective of the changes in the human world. The artist finds comfort in the inherent stability of nature, which finds expression in her paintings like the one in which men are taking an evening dip at a city bathing ghat or an idol finds place at the foot of an old tree trunk.                  Event: An exhibition of paintings by Tanima Bhattacharya When: Till today; 3 pm - 8 pm Where: Photographers Gallery, 59A Southend Park, Gol Park

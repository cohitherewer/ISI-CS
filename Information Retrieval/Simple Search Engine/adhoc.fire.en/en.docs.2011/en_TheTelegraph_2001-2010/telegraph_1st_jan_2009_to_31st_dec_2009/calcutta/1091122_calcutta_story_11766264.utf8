                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Calcutta Questions
                                            
	The report Calcutta Questions, published in Metro on November 8, 2009, was based on a PUBLIC amp; GfK-MODE survey conducted in association with The Telegraph on the nature of Calcuttans daily civic problems. Beginning this week, Metro on Sunday will carry a series of articles highlighting the findings of the survey.   
	The findings revealed that 80 per cent of the 600 respondents named power cuts as a problem, but only 36 per cent of those who rated it as one of the top three problems actually contacted an agency for redress. Only 29 per cent of all respondents had taken any action to resolve a problem, whether related to power, garbage or water. There is strong reluctance to contact any agency: whether CESC. Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) or police.         
	The reluctance was almost uniform across three income groups: above Rs 17,500 monthly family income; between Rs 12,500 and Rs 17,500; and below Rs 12,500. Comparing age groups, the survey revealed uniformity among the age brackets too  26 to 35 years, 36 to 45 years, 46 to 55 years and above 56 years. Of these, the above-56 age group appeared least inclined to take action (73 per cent), compared with the other age groups (69 to 70 per cent).         
	Do public agencies put off older people most?         
	Those living in pucca houses show an almost similar lack of interest as multi-storeyed residents in approaching an agency (29 and 25 per cent). But those living in slums showed greater readiness (34 per cent). This may be because residents of slums are, out of necessity, more in touch with their local leaders who direct them to an agency.         
	But why dont most citizens approach the agencies? Among those who said they hadnt taken any action to solve a problem, 31 per cent said they didnt think their problem would be solved by an agency. Age-wise, those between 46 and 55 years appeared the most disillusioned with the agencies (35 per cent) and pucca house residents had the least faith in the service providers (33 per cent). Thus, older people living in pucca houses were the most sceptical of the agencies.         
	The second-most common reason cited by citizens for inaction was lack of information about where to lodge a complaint (21 per cent). Those in the lower income group (24 per cent) were the least informed about the proper agencies, while among age groups, the younger lot had the most information about the right agencies (26 per cent). Most noticeable was the gap in terms of house types. Among slum dwellers, 36 per cent were unaware of the right agencies as against 10 per cent of multi-storey building residents.         
	The next reason was the inability of a single person to solve a problem (20 per cent). Of those who cited lack of time to approach an agency (19 per cent), most were younger and from the high-income group.        
	But it is important to remember that the agencies are there to serve the citizens.         
	Mira Roy, an 83-year-old resident of Jodhpur Park, lives alone in a ground floor flat. The CMC had placed a garbage vat outside her home. The local civic office did not nothing. Roy then sought the help of her landladys son and went around collecting signatures against the vat. She sent these to the CMC and after three years, the vat was removed.        
	It is also up to the citizens to ensure service. So keep calling the numbers below.

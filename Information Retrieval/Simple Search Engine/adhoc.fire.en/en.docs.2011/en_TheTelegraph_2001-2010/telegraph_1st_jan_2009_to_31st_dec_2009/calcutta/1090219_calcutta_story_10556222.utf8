The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rare transplant at NRS
                                                                                                               Rare transplant at NRS

	Doctors at Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital (NRS) conducted a bone marrow transplantation on a cancer patient recently, the first such procedure to be carried out in eastern India.        
	The patient  37-year-old Bela Samanta  is suffering from multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer.        
	The breakthrough is likely to make bone marrow transplant more affordable, holding out hope for thousands suffering from diseases such as breast cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.        
	Moloy Ghosh, the head of haematology at NRS, said the transplant was possibly the first in any state government hospital in the country.         
	To the best of my knowledge, apart from private hospitals, only central government institutions have performed bone marrow transplant in India, he said.        
	The process  called peripheral autologous stem cell transplant  involves administering an injection to increase the production of stem cells in the peripheral blood of the patient, extracting the blood, refrigerating it at 4 degrees Celsius and infusing it back intravenously.        
	A team of doctors led by Kanjanksha Ghosh, the director of the National Institute of Immuno-Haematology in Mumbai, performed the procedure at NRS over three days between January 28 and 30. The team included Maitreyee Bhattacharya, Somnath Mukherjee and Jayanta Chanda.        
	The patient has recovered well and will be sent home in three to four days, said Moloy Ghosh on Wednesday.         
	The procedure is expected to increase the lifespan of the patient by five to seven years, said Somnath Mukherjee, one of the doctors on the team.        
	Samanta, a resident of Bhairavpur village in Burdwan, was detected with the cancer a year back. She used to suffer bone pain, weakness and anaemia.        
	She was admitted to our hospital on December 16. She first underwent chemotherapy. Her vital organs were checked before we went ahead with the transplantation, said Maitreyee Bhattacharya, another doctor.        
	In India, bone marrow transplants are performed at AIIMS and the Army (Research and Referral) Hospital in New Delhi, PGIMER in Chandigarh and SGPGI in Lucknow  all centrally funded institutions. Private hospitals also perform the procedure, but at a high cost.         
	Private institutions in Mumbai and Chennai charge Rs 7 lakh to Rs 8 lakh. We performed it for Rs 1,75,000. Patients save on the cost of travel as well, said Mukherjee.        
	In Calcutta, apart from NRS, only AMRI Dhakuria has a cell separator or apheresis, necessary for bone marrow transplantation.         
	NRS has been flooded with requests for bone marrow transplantation.         
	We are trying to reduce the cost further by using free samples of drugs, said L.K. Ghosh, the medical supervisor and vice-principal of the hospital.

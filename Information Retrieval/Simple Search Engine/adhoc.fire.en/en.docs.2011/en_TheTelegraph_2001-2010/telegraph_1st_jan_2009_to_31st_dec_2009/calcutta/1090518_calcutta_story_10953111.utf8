The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Airport health team on swine flu alert 
                                                                                                               Airport health team on swine flu alert 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The health authorities at the city airport have been put on alert for swine flu but passengers alleged the checks were farcical.        
	Medical examination of passengers arriving from China and other affected countries, such as Hong Kong and Korea, has been stepped up, an official in the airports health department said. The suspect passengers are being examined physically.        
	A 30-year-old student from the University of Missouri, US, was recently identified as Chinas first patient infected with the H1N1 virus that causes swine flu. The student arrived in Tokyo from the US and then flew to Beijing and finally to Chengdu. It was on the last fight that he suffered from symptoms of swine flu and went to hospital.        
	The report of the detection of the swine flu virus in the flier has left the authorities in Calcutta worried as the city has a direct airlink with Kunming in south China.        
	Calcutta airport has 20 doctors, four nurses and three paramedical experts to scan passengers in the international terminal.        
	But several fliers alleged that the examination was not foolproof. After walking into the arrival area of the international terminal, the passengers are directed to a group of men and women in laboratory suits and surgical masks, seated behind a long table, said a flier who arrived from Australia on a Singapore Airlines flight last week.        
	They examine a photocopied questionnaire that all travellers to India are required to fill up. After sifting through the papers, they stamp the documents and allow passengers to move on to the immigration counter, the flier added

  - Work-clock compliance better, not attitude          OUR BUREAU                          An employee signs the attendance register on Thursday even as his watch shows 10.49am, 34 minutes past the deadline. Picture by Sanat Kr Sinha                                        
	Assistant clerk Monoranjan Ghosh (name changed) clocked 10.35am in the race to Writers Buildings on Thursday, shaving 40 minutes off his previous best but falling short of the qualifying time by 20 minutes.        
	Onyo diney ami 11.15am-er aage ekhane dhuki nakoyek din kora-kori cholbe bole taratari chole elam (On other days I dont enter before 11.15amI came early only because monitoring will be strict here for a few days), said the 48-year-old finance department employee, signing the attendance register and then heading towards the tea vendor in the corridor.        
	Ghoshs remark sums up what the majority of the workforce thinks about the new attendance regimen at Writers  a temporary occupational hazard.        
	 How many days will you be able to maintain such surveillance? an employee of the agriculture department questioned a group of photographers aiming their cameras at an empty office room around 10.30am. People will come on time for a few days, or at least try to do so. But you wont be watching every day, will you? he mocked.        
	On Thursday, more employees did seem to make an effort to meet the 10.15am deadline than on the first day of the extended work clock but many sauntered in late, as usual, and also left early.         
	Durjoy Ghosh, a 28-year-old assistant sub-inspector at gate No. 3 of the secretariat, said he had not seen so many employees in a hurry in the 17 months that he has been posted there. Until Wednesday, many employees would walk in well after 11am. Thursday was different with some people coming even before the clock had struck 10, said the reserve force officer.        
	So will those who clocked a Perfect 10 on Thursday remain punctual?        
	We are under the scanner because this issue is in focus. But in a weeks time everybody will forget about it and things will be back to square one, said typist Ranjan Saha (name changed), among those who signed the attendance register on the dot.        
	Unlike the first day when impromptu sit-ins were organised to protest the punctuality code, Thursday was peaceful at Writers, according to an official statement.        
	Employees by and large came and left on time. We know that there is resentment over the delay in payment of DA arrears but attendance is a different issue, said home secretary Ardhendu Sen.        
	The office timings at Writers have remained unchanged  10am to 5.30pm  but employees are entitled to a grace period of not more than 15 minutes under the new code. If anyone comes in late for more than three days in a month, he or she will automatically forfeit a days casual leave.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rush in line rather than online
                                                                                                               Rush in line rather than online
  - TECH HITCH: PROBLEM OF ACCESS amp; LACK OF FAITH          A STAFF REPORTER                          Students at Presidency College verify the admission procedure and pick up forms from the College Street campus. Picture by Pradip Sanyal                                        
	Students seeking admission to colleges in the city still prefer being in line to going online when it comes to applying for seats.        
	Long queues in front of the colleges marked the first day of the admission season, with most students complaining about clogged websites and some claiming that the information available online was generally unreliable.        
	Colleges like St Xaviers and Presidency made forms available online on Saturday and several more put their admission pages on the Web on Monday.        
	But as online traffic increased and the websites slowed down, the queues of students  and their parents  outside the colleges swelled.        
	I tried accessing the Asutosh College website last night for information about admissions but could not go beyond the home page, said Soumya Bhattacharya, a resident of Bhadreswar.        
	He was among those lining up in front of the college on Monday. Students and parents jostled for space in front of the notice board that listed the admission criteria for all subjects.        
	Metro witnessed similar scenes at Lady Brabourne, Scottish Church and Bethune despite all three colleges accepting applications online.        
	People are coming to the college to ask for the same information that we have put up on our website. Many students and guardians may have had trouble accessing websites, but I also suspect there are some who do not trust information available online, said Sanghamitra Mukherjee, the principal of Lady Brabourne College.        
	A student waiting for his turn in front of the help desk at Presidency College admitted to being unsure about online admission procedures.        
	I keep thinking that the information given on the website is dated and that I might have misunderstood the instructions. I would rather physically verify the details, he said.        
	For many others who had turned up at the colleges to collect information about admissions, limited access to the Internet was the problem.        
	I am aware that forms are available online, and I did visit an Internet cafe to download the form but the site was not loading. I did not want to waste more time at a cyber cafe, so I decided to collect a form from the college itself, said a student in the queue in front of Vidyasagar College, near Thanthania Kalibari.        
	The queues at campuses across the city also included students and guardians who admitted feeling intimidated at the prospect of accessing information or submitting an application online.        
	Colleges like Scottish Church and St Xaviers have set up computer centres on campus for those who do not have access to the Internet or are unsure about online admissions. Presidency College intends setting up a similar centre on Tuesday.

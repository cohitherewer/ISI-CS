The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Just park it on the thoroughfare
                                                                            Tuesday , November 3 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Just park it on the thoroughfare
                                            
	Two trucks caught fire and an employee of the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) was injured severely in an accident on BT Road on October 27. Metro travelled the 300 metres between the Bonhooghly crossing and the ISI to find out what ails the notorious stretch.              
	Illegal parking        
	Residents said the entire 300m stretch turned into a parking lot for goods vehicles after 8pm. The road was widened to 22m for smoother movement of traffic but illegal parking has reduced the space and resulted in frequent accidents.         
	Police allow vehicles to park here illegally for a bribe, said Ramesh Shaw, a local resident.        
	The cops charge Rs 20 per vehicle for parking. Some drivers pay Rs 200 to Rs 250 for a month, said Bhola Yadav, a helper in a truck.              
	Missing traffic signals         
	The stretch does not have any traffic signals. The police said the road was manned by two constables, but Metro didnt see any cop on duty on October 28. One constable was later seen sipping tea at a roadside stall.        
	We have been demanding installation of traffic signals on the stretch for long, said Pradip Roy, the spokesperson for ISI. He said two weeks back, an ISI employee died and seven were injured when a speeding truck skipped a signal and hit them.         
	The authorities of the nearby Central Modern School said they too had complained to the police about illegal parking and lack of traffic signals but to no avail.              
	Pedestrian peril        
	The pavements along the road are taken up by parked vehicles, public baths, garbage dumps, shops and eateries, forcing pedestrians to walk down the carriageway.         
	Goods vehicles park not only along the road but climb on the pavement too. Heaps of building materials and garages take up whatever is left of the pavement, said Ujjwaini Chatterjee, a student of Rabindrabharati University.              
	Missing road dividers        
	Road dividers and guard rails were absent at five places on the short stretch. Residents alleged that the dividers were demolished by the owners of garages that line the road for easier movement of vehicles coming for repairs.         
	The stretch becomes dangerous with vehicles taking sharp U-turns or entering the carriageway from the wrong end.        
	The traffic guard and the local police station are aware of the mischief but allow garage owners to break the divider for a one-time payment of Rs 10,000 to Rs 20,000, said a mechanic of a local garage.              
	Official word        
	After the accident on October 27, our officers met local residents and the ISI authorities and prepared a set of proposals for the district magistrate. The proposals include installation of an automatic signalling system and setting up guard rails, said a senior officer of Belghoria traffic guard.         
	P.K. Tripathi, the additional superintendent of police, Barrackpore, said the police were planning to designate the 300m stretch as a no parking zone and take steps to free the pavements.         
	The ISI has promised help by providing eight private security guards who will work with the cops to man traffic and prevent illegal parking on the stretch, Tripathi added.

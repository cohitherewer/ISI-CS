      Banish the bogey of conservation                        Ingval Maxwell makes a point at the talk. (Bishwarup Dutta)                        
	How does one conserve old buildings in a city like Calcutta where funds are hard to come by? Ingval Maxwell, a conservation architect who retired from the organisation, Historic Scotland, last year, has come out with a practical suggestion.     
	As the word conservation smacks of elitism and raises the bogey of high costs, perhaps the problem should be looked at from a different perspective. Since repairs are a necessity to keep a building safe, over a period of time something like conservation will be achieved through proper repairing.     
	Maxwell was answering questions after delivering a lecture on Training and education initiatives in Building Conservation organised by the British Council in collaboration with the Centre for Archaeological Studies and Training, Eastern India, on Friday evening.    
	Maxwell has a pragmatic approach towards conservation and he recommended the use of medieval technology in tandem with laser technology, laser scanning and the thermographic image whose possibilities are phenomenal.     
	He stressed the need for training, support activities, professionalism and sharing of knowledge. While international relevance was important, methods could vary from country to country.    
	He said on his current visit to India he has noticed some interesting change vis-a-vis conservation, which was a sign of progress. The growth of tourism was expected, which could become a driver of local knowledge. There was a danger in having too much money, Maxwell said, as decisions could be made very quickly. On the other hand, limited resources could lead to deeper thinking that could rationalise spending.    
	Asked if poorer nations were at all interested in heritage conservation, Maxwell said even African countries were. He suggested exploration of the website of the International Council of Monuments and Sites that could be quite revealing.

	The Independent Woman  Myth or Reality was the subject of discussion at an event organised by Rotary District 3291 to mark Womens Day. A first of its kind for Rotary International, the event brought together host Nayantara Pal Choudhuri, the first woman governor of the district, Amal Allana, the chairperson of the National School of Drama, Pamela Philipose, the director of Womens Features Service and Stephen Huyler, an author and art critic from the US.     
	Moderating the event, Kavita Panjabi, a professor of comparative literature and womens studies at Jadavpur University, said womens demands havent changed much from those of the women workers of Lawrence textile mills who struck work for fair wages and dignity at home and in the workplace.     
	The discussion ranged from the changing representation of women in theatre to the need for economic independence, the Womens Reservation Bill and the role of the media.     
	Urmi Basu of New Light, an NGO working for children of sex workers, and Savitri Pal of Southern Health Improvement Samiti were felicitated.

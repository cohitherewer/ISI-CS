The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fab physicists have a date with research scholars

          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI IN NEW DELHI                              William Phillips and Eric Cornell				                                 
	Two Nobel Laureates who helped build the worlds first Bose-Einstein Condensate will come calling in January, along with leading international physicists, to lecture and interact with a select group of research scholars.        
	William Phillips, Eric Cornell and other experts who helped build an exotic state of matter proposed by Satyendra Nath Bose and Albert Einstein 75 years ago will participate in a school in Calcutta before attending a conference in Shankarpur.        
	The school  a workshop to provide a forum for PhD and post-doctoral scholars to learn from leading experts on the subject  will be held between January 6 and 16 at the Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture in Gol Park. The conference in Sankarpur will be held from January 18 to 21, with many students attending the school also participating in the conference.        
	The school and conference are a rare opportunity for young physicists to learn the tools of their subject from the masters themselves, said Manas Mukherjee of The Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, Calcutta, where Nobel Laureate C.V. Raman had discovered the effects of atoms on the scattering of light.        
	The school and conference are being organised by the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research.        
	It is rare for a Nobel Laureate to lecture at a school for research scholars in India, but that is what William Phillips will be doing.        
	The organisers have deliberately chosen to accommodate lecturers at the school and participating research scholars at the same venue  to allow them to interact even after lecture hours.        
	The idea is to expose young researchers to the best in their field, and also to prepare them for the conference that will follow the school, said Bhanu Das, at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore, who is one of the organisers of the school and conference.        
	In 1924-25, Bose and Einstein had postulated a new state of matter comprising a set of gas particles called bosons at temperatures within a whisker of the lowest possible temperature (minus 273 degree Celsius).        
	The Bose-Einstein Condensate is popularly referred to as the fifth state of matter. Gases under normal pressure condense into liquids which then freeze into solid state as temperatures are reduced. Scientists had used pressure variations to try and cool gas particles to low temperatures without condensation.        
	But Phillips, with Steven Chu and Claude Cohen-Tannoudji, for the first time showed that lasers striking atoms from opposing directions could be used to chill atoms to temperatures lower than those achieved through pressure variations. The trio received the Nobel in 1997 for what has since come to be known as laser cooling.        
	Fourteen other experts on ultra-cold atoms and ultra-cold ions (electrically charged atoms) from top research institutes across the world will also lecture at the school.        
	The organisers had initially planned to invite 30 young researchers for the school but overwhelming response forced them to increase the number to 60. We unfortunately had to reject many candidates because the lecture theatre cannot accomodate more than 60, said Das.         
	Cornell, who with Carl Wieman and Wolfgang Ketterle produced the first ever Bose-Einstein Condensate using laser cooling and won the 2001 Nobel, will participate in the conference.

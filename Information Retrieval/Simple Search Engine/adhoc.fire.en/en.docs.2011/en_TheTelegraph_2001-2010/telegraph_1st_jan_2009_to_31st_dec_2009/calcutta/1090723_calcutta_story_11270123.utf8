The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 8 lakh snatched from woman in city centre 
                                                                                                               8 lakh snatched from woman in city centre 
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A frail-looking youth snatched Rs 8 lakh from a 38-year-old businesswoman outside a highrise building in the central business district on Wednesday afternoon.        
	The youth picked up the cash wrapped in plastic from Poonam Devi Goenkas handbag and melted into the crowd. The incident occurred on Hari Ram Goenka Street in Posta at 12.40pm while Goenka was waiting for her help to return after delivering some money to her business partner.        
	Goenka runs a boutique at her CR Avenue residence and also deals in gold ornaments.        
	I had kept the cash inside the bag but the zip was open. It happened so fast that the youth had disappeared even before I could react, she told the cops. I have no clue if the youth had specific information about the amount I was carrying.... I dont doubt my help.        
	The Posta police and the detective department have started a probe into the incident. Goenka left her shop  Sonam Creations  with her help Chottu and took a rickshaw to Posta. They got off outside a building near Adibashtala. Goenka took out a plastic packet containing Rs 2 lakh from her handbag and asked Chhotu to deliver it to her partner on the first floor of the building.         
	The woman feels Chottu is above suspicion. So we have not detained him, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of the detective department. May be the snatcher was unaware of the amount inside the bag, he added.        
	In another case, sleuths of the anti-snatching wing of the detective department arrested Mohammed Shakib Anees, 22, and Mckally Mark Williams, 28, of Collins Street on charges of snatching gold ornaments from morning walkers. The duo, who went around on a motorcycle, had robbed three women in Beleghata, Kalighat and Jodhpur Park in June.         
	After the morning round, the two would join their work as sales executive at a reputable automobile shop on AJC Bose Road. At night, they would party, the sleuths said.

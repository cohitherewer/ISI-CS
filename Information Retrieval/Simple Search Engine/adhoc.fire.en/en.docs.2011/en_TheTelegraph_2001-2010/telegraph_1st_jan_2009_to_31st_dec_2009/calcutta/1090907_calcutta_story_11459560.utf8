The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Marmoset mastermind arrested
                                                                                                               Marmoset mastermind arrested
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Rajesh at Lalbazar on Sunday. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                  
	The alleged mastermind behind the marmoset theft from Alipore zoo on August 8 was arrested in Rajasthans Ajmer on Saturday night.        
	Rajesh Singh, 30, was flown to the city on Sunday evening.        
	Sleuths said Rajesh, alias Sher, was an old hand at stealing rare animals, including marmosets, from government and private zoos and had links with wildlife rackets in India and abroad.        
	We have learnt that he had poached on several private zoos in Lonavala and Pune in Maharashtra, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters).        
	Shamim said Rajesh and Raj Saikia, another key accused who was arrested recently in Durg, had entered Alipore zoo during the foiled attempt to steal marmosets in March.        
	The blueprint for the August 8 theft was chalked out by Rajesh, who visited the city once to give final touches to the plan. It was Saikia who entered the zoo at night to steal the eight marmosets. He left the city with the monkeys the next morning while Rajesh was tapping potential buyers, said Shamim.        
	An officer of the detective department said Rajesh, whose ancestral house is in Punjabs Karnal, started off as a drug peddler. He fled from police custody while being taken to court nine years ago. Since then he had been to several places before settling down in Ajmer, said Shamim.        
	We came to know about Rajesh from our own network and immediately alerted the Rajasthan police. A six-member team from the city camped in Jaipur over the past two days, said an officer.        
	We were told that Rajesh was in Ajmer. We activated our source network and tracked him down, said Sanjeev Bhatnagar, the additional superintendent of the anti-terrorist squad of the Rajasthan police.        
	In the wake of the Raj Saikia episode, the police decided to bring Rajesh by flight instead of train.        
	Saikia had fled while being brought to the city by the Down Ahmedabad Express when all four of his escorts  an inspector, a sub-inspector and two constables  fell asleep. The same team, however, rearrested him hours later.

  - Father of Jennys 16 derives power from healthy diet and homoeopathy          POULOMI BANERJEE                           Prince takes a breather in his Bally home. Picture by Gopal Senapati                                        
	Prince, the Golden Retriever who fathered Jennys sweet 16, is a pro at the mating game and has never failed to deliver, according to his proud owner.        
	 Finding a good Golden Retriever to mate with your dog is difficult, and attempts to pair dogs are often unsuccessful. Prince is in demand and has mated six-seven times since becoming part of our family. He has a 100 per cent strike rate, boasts retired Metro Railway official Basabendra Nath Mukherjee of Bally.         
	Jenny, Princes latest conquest, gave birth to a litter of 16 puppies by Caesarean section on Friday. Veterinarian N.K. Basu, who conducted the Caesarean, and dog breeder Subhasish Chakraborty  Princes mating manager  insist it is a local record for the largest litter.        
	So what is the secret of Princes potency?        
	Boiled soyabean for breakfast and chicken, mutton, fish or egg for lunch and dinner keep Prince in fine fettle, says Mukherjee.        
	The extra edge comes from protein supplements and a homoeopathic medicine that Mukherjee started administering to Prince weeks before his date with Jenny.        
	Prince was two years old when the Mukherjees brought him home 14 months ago. We had a Labrador who bit my grandson, forcing us to give him away. We were on the lookout for a friendlier replacement when someone told us about Prince, who then belonged to a doctor, recalls the retired official.        
	Prince has since become a beloved member of the Bally family. My grandson adores him, says Mukherjee.        
	Has the man of the moment been told about his feat? No, Prince hasnt yet set eyes on his progeny, laughs Mukherjee. Subhasish called me immediately after Jennys delivery and I was very excited. We hope to visit the pups soon.

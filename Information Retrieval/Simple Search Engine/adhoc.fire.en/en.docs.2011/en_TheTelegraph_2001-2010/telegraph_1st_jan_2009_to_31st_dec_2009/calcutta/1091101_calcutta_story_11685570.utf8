The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Walk, to save the planet
                                                                                                               Walk, to save the planet
                              The pavement along MG Road has disappeared under hawkers and their wares. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                            
	Can you walk and help heal the world? Yes. More walking means less use of vehicles, especially fossil fuel-powered private ones, which contribute heavily to global warming. A city has to allow its citizens to walk freely.        
	A recent study by the Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) confirms what Calcuttans have long known: that the city, along with most big cities of the country, is not quite friendly to walkers (barring bandh days). Calcutta fares poorly on the walkability index.         
	The survey comes up with other facts. Calcutta fares badly despite the fact that almost one-fourth of citys population walks, or has to walk. Calcuttas walkers belong to three broad categories: those connected to educational activities (57 per cent), business (21 per cent) or simply returning home (32 per cent).         
	According to a nationwide study carried out by the US-based Wilbur Smith Associates for the Union ministry of urban development in 2008, the walkability index of Calcutta was 0.81  lower than Delhi, Mumbai or Chandigarh, but better than Chennai and Bangalore. The international standard is almost double that of Calcutta.         
	The data, based on the quality and quantity of footpaths, doesnt reveal the ground reality of Calcutta, though. Footpaths in the city are used and abused for every purpose except what they are meant for  walking. Most pavements teem with hawkers and vendors, forcing pedestrians to walk down the carriageway, risking life and limb. Political and police patronage ensure that litigation or court directives have little or no effect on hawker presence on pavements.        
	A number of pavements are used as open latrines, or house shanties, small garages, eateries, party offices or religious structures. And the citys walkers end up paying the price. Sixty-four per cent of accidents in Calcutta involve walkers on the road, the highest in the country.         
	Taking note of the lack of action against pavement rule violators, the high court on October 23 gave the government a fortnight to file a report on the pavement and parking chaos in the city.         
	The CSE report points out that climate change, particularly emission of green house gases like carbon dioxide, is directly linked to walkability.         
	Less walkability means greater dependence on private transport as the use of public transport involves at least two walk trips, to and from the house, explained Anumita Roy Choudhury, a senior researcher from CSE.         
	No wonder Calcutta is tagged the carbon capital of the country.                     JAYANTA BASU

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Planes, trains bear brunt of protest
                                                                                                               Planes, trains bear brunt of protest
                            
	Calcutta was a lawless land on Friday. The 12-hour bandh called by the Congress and supported by the Trinamul Congress disrupted life across the city. All modes of transport  buses, trains and even planes  were affected, restricting movement. Metro toured the areas worst hit by the bandh               
	Airport        
	Two blocks on airport approaches caused severe problems for people who were on their way to catch flights as well as those on their way home.        
	About 50 Congress workers put up a blockade at the Baguiati intersection around 9am. They refused to allow even the traffic to and from the airport to pass.        
	Raj Sinha, a trader who flew in from Bangalore, was one of those stuck because of the blockade. First, I could not get a taxi from the airport. A car agreed to take me to my residence in Hastings for Rs 450 but it was stopped at Baguiati. What will the political parties get by harassing the common people? asked Sinha.        
	Around 9.30am, another group of Congress supporters put up a blockade near the airport Gate No. 1. Within minutes a long queue of vehicles formed on either side of the blockade.        
	The demonstrators were misbehaving with us. The children were terrified, said Noor-ul-Haq, who was held up on his way to the city after arriving from Dhaka with his and his brothers family.         
	Thirteen flights were cancelled. Airport director R. Srinivasan said: Flights took off and landed throughout the day but the bandh did affect the operations. Flights that were to take off during the day were pushed back to evening or combined with evening flights.              
	Rashbehari Avenue-Hazra        
	About 25 unarmed Congress supporters heading from the Rashbehari Avenue crossing to the Hazra crossing tried to pull down the shutters of a gate to Kalighat Metro station, prompting the police to allegedly lathicharge them. In retaliation, those who were taking part in the rally rushed towards the cops with sticks.        
	Congress leader Nirbed Ray, who was leading the rally, said the police had no reason to lathicharge the protesters. The police later allowed the procession to proceed to the Hazra crossing.                
	Stations        
	Long-distance and local trains were stopped by bandh supporters. Congress supporters stopped trains since 6am at various stations in the Howrah, Sealdah, Asansol, Malda and Kharagpur divisions of Eastern Railway and South Eastern Railway.         
	Several long-distance and local trains of both Eastern and South Eastern Railway were cancelled.        
	The Howrah and Sealdah-bound Rajdhani trains were stranded at Dhanbad. The Kalka Mail was stopped at Burdwan. The Mumbai-Howrah Mail was stranded at Uluberia and the Puri-Howrah Jagannath Express at Mecheda. Most of the trains reached the city late in the evening. Railway officials said food and drink were served at the stations. Trains ran on schedule from Sealdah from 5.10pm and from Howrah from 5.30pm.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tech tool to bypass New Town block
                                                                            Saturday , November 14 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Tech tool to bypass New Town block
          SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE                              
	The state government has pulled out of its hat a new agency armed with a tech tool to bypass the Rajarhat land protest hurdle.        
	With Trinamul Congress in power in all the six panchayats  Rajarhat I, Rajarhat II, Patharghata, Mahishbathan, Chandpur and Jyangra-Hatiara  in Rajarhat, the sanction for thousands of building plans is stuck in the township that Hidco started developing in the early 1990s.        
	We have created a new agency, Newtown Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA), which will have the power to process the applications online and sanction building plans. We have done this to fast-track the development of the township, said Goutam Deb, the housing minister and chairman of Hidco.         
	Hidco can only give land and develop infrastructure while the local panchayats have the right to sanction building plans. Following the sudden political change in the area and the land protests after the Vedic Village controversy, the panchayats are not sanctioning any building plan, said a senior official.         
	According to Hidco sources, over 3,500 building plans are held up with the panchayats. The number will go up to a few lakhs in the next five years as the Trinamul-led panchayats have vowed not to sanction any building plan, said the official.        
	In a desperate bid to bypass the building block, Hidco  in association with Jadavpur University  has developed an online system to sanction building plans, to be launched on Saturday.        
	A special act  Newtown Kolkata Development Authority Act, 2007  has been used to set up the development authority armed with the teeth to sanction building plans.        
	Local Trinamul leaders have already decided to oppose the online system.        
	Instead of addressing the farmers woes, the government is trying to create another point of conflict, said Trinamul leader Purnendu Basu, who is heading the land protests in Rajarhat.        
	According to him, party leaders have instructed the panchayat members to scrutinise each building plan before giving a seal of approval.        
	If the land belongs to unwilling farmers we wont allow it to be taken away forcibly. We are preparing a list of plots forcibly grabbed by Hidco. This will take some time and we wont sanction new plans unless the list is ready, said Prabir Kar, the president of the Rajarhat (Grameen) unit of Trinamul.

										                        Kadahis on stoves at the exhibition SEZ Who?				                           
	Oscar Wilde may have remarked with characteristic levity that All art is useless, but young contemporary Indian artists would have none of that. Some of them, at least, are bent on being useful or to produce work that has some purpose, social change being one of them. The five participants of SEZ Who?, an art project enfolding at Experimenter curated by Mumbai-based artist Tushar Joag, belong to this category.        
	According to the note being handed out to viewers, SEZ Who? is a project led by a group of artists and Experimenter exploring the impact and rationale of setting up Special Economic Zones in India. Unlike a typical exhibition, it brings into the gallery environment a kind of activism-based collaborative project, which transforms every week to finally realise its end by creating settings and experiences for the viewers of establishment of SEZ-like conditions.         
	The participating artists are Tushar Joag, Prajakta Potnis, Sharmila Samant, Justin Ponmany and Uday Shanbhag, and they went about like young Turks with a conscience documenting and interviewing people in Raigarh district and the Gorai Uttan belt near Mumbai where the SEZs were to be established.        
	Fact-finding over, they have turned the space in Experimenter gallery into five different stations. The space keeps changing every day, as salt  with its connotations of Satyagraha  produced in Raigarh and Gorai Uttan and spread on the floor, gradually moves to one point in the gallery, where, on the final day, it will form a saline mound symbolic of the peoples protest against SEZ gaining momentum.         
	Now glass vials, two stoves with kadahis from which water from the two SEZs has evaporated to leave behind salt grains, a pile of gunny sacks for food grain and a ladder have been placed at various points and they will come into play later. Short films on similar protests will be screened for a week from July 14 and the project is on till July 25. The participants plan to create an art object for which there will be a lucky draw on the last day, but before that special forms will be given out to viewers from June 29.         
	Experimenter acts as an incubator of concepts and ideas and the viewer is encouraged to interact and participate.         
	Gallery K2 celebrates its second anniversary by exhibiting the watercolours of the young artist Sudipta Karmakar, whose series of paintings depicts the Wonders of India  from the Golden Temple in Amritsar to Dhola Vira, the remnant of Harappan civilisation in Gujarat. Trained at the Government College of Art and Craft, Karmakars paintings are almost like photographs insomuch as they are realistic both in colouring and are faithful likenesses of the monuments they aim at portraying.        
	However, these paintings deserved a touch of imagination without which they look like sterile copies of photographs. Karmakars drawing needs improvement. The head of the Buddha in Tawang monastery looks almost flat and his human figures are stiff and lifeless. Archaeological drawings fall flat unless the drawing is perfect.              
	Its too darn hot, and that is bound to have an effect on ongoing exhibitions. The heat has surely got the better of those who put together Trying to make sense of it all now on at Ganges Art gallery. This one has four artists  Debraj Goswami, Somit Gupta, Rajiba Lochan Pani and Pampa Panwar. Three of them are rather well known artists but their works look tired and uninspired. Anyway, Debraj Goswamis visual puns (this time he uses hammers) are overused, and perhaps he should think of something that would stir the imagination a little more.         
	Rajiba Lochan Pani is concerned about the exploitation of nature in his village by multinationals and he has been expressing his distress for a long time through his canvases. He does it this time again, but he has nothing new to say. So we hear the same story once again.         
	It is the same with Pampa Panwar, who in her earlier canvases harked back to the yet uspoilt nature of her early days in Santiniketan. At least some of her current crop of paintings seem to be collages of bits and pieces from her earlier work, although one of them has a novel format  that of a cottage with a sloping roof.         
	Somit Gupta splatters dark acrylic paint on acrylic sheets, and oftentimes they take the shape of human beings. Gupta has a limited repertoire of skills as a colourist and a draughtsman, and this does not help his work.       SOUMITRA DAS

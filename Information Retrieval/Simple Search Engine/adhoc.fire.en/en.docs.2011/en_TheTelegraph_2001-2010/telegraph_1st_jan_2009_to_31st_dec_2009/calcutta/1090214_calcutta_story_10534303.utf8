The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fear of floors on flight path
                                                                                                               Fear of floors on flight path

	A Buffalo is waiting to happen in Calcutta.        
	As tall buildings, some with cellphone towers on their roofs, come up around the city airport, officials have whispered warnings of an aircraft crashing into an obstacle while approaching to land or just after take-off.        
	Late on Thursday, a Continental Express flight of Colgan Air crashed into a building near Buffalo, New York, after the pilot lost contact with the air traffic control.        
	All 48 people on board and one person on the ground were killed as the plane went up in flames.        
	Fearing a similar disaster closer home, a pilot said: While landing at Calcutta airport we see a lot of new buildings, some quite high. We have asked the Airports Authority of India (AAI) to probe the matter.        
	In recent months, the ground proximity warning system of at least three aircraft preparing to land had gone off, alerting the pilots about obstacles on or near the flight paths.        
	The warning system is automatically activated when an aircraft is in danger of touching down on the ground, instead of the runway, or hitting an obstacle.        
	An Air India pilot had faced the problem twice while landing and reported the matter to the authorities, said an airport official who did not want to be named.        
	The pilot was confused. Despite maintaining the right angle, the warning system asked him to pull up, the official added.        
	The finger of suspicion points at the construction boom around the airport with rules being regularly flouted under dubious circumstances.        
	But there is no way to ascertain why the ground warning system went off, as the safety survey by the AAI is due for more than five years at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport.        
	The survey, supposed to be conducted every two-three years at all airports, aims to determine whether there are obstructions on flight paths.        
	The survey team from AAIs cartography department has not visited Calcutta airport for several years. A shortage of manpower has been cited as the reason, said P. K. Singhal, the regional executive director (eastern India) of AAI.        
	To add to the risk factor, the city airport is functioning without an aero standard officer, whose duty is to enforce safety norms.        
	Any proposal for a building within 20km of the airport has to abide by the AAI norms, said an official.        
	According to aviation safety rules, only single-storey buildings can come up within two-three km of the airport. On certain stretches, there should be no construction at all.        
	For buildings that are not too close to the airport, the AAI sets a height limit depending on the distance from the airport, flight path angles and other factors.        
	Rules are stringent for buildings and mobile towers close to the runway. The AAI survey team studies obstructions within a radius of approximately 2km. If there is even a slight deviation from what has been laid down, immediate action has to be taken to clear the obstructions, said an official.        
	We have raised the issue with the AAI, asking the authorities to give us a list of unsafe buildings so that the municipalities can take proper steps, said Amitabha Nandi, the CPM MP from Dum Dum and chairman of the advisory committee to the AAI.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Strokes of green in Salt Lake
                                                                                                               Strokes of green in Salt Lake
          TAMAGHNA BANERJEE              SALT LAKE            CALCUTTA            TOWNSHIP TAKES THE LEAD: (Top) A fleet of green autos in Salt Lake on Tuesday (picture by Pradip Sanyal); a maze of non-LPG autos in south Calcutta                                 
	After showing the graffiti-scarred city how to keep its walls clean at poll time, Salt Lake seems to be leading the clean-fuel move with around 50 per cent of its two-stroke auto fleet going visibly green.        
	Officials of the Regional Transport Authority (RTA), North 24-Parganas, and Citu leaders told Metro the rate of conversion from two-stroke to four-stroke LPG in the township was almost 45 per cent more than in the rest of the city.        
	Around 850 three-wheelers ply in Salt Lake, of which more than half have turned green over the past four months. We havent withdrawn our plea to the state government to extend the phase-out deadline (July 31) but we arent stopping drivers from switching to LPG autos, said Pronab Banerjee, the secretary of the CPMs Salt Lake 1 committee and a Citu leader.        
	A senior transport official said union leaders in Salt Lake were a lot more co-operative than their counterparts elsewhere, making the switch to green fuel relatively easier in the township.        
	But green activists warned that conversion in some cases was restricted to the colour of the auto. There are instances of 2-stroke autos running on petrol or even katatel donning the disguise of green vehicles with paint and specially-made parts at local workshops, said environmentalist Krishnajyoti Goswami.        
	A representative of Bajaj Auto Ltd, the countrys largest manufacturer of three-wheelers, said the company had so far supplied around 150 four-stroke, LPG-compliant autos to Salt Lake. Our sales figures reveal that many more two-stroke autos have been replaced in the northern part of the city, though it is difficult to say how many clean autos are actually running in Salt Lake, said V. Kumar of Bajaj Auto Ltd.        
	Auto driver Ajit Roy, who ferries passengers on the Ultadanga-Karunamoyee route, said he decided to switch to a four-stroke, LPG-compliant vehicle on realising that the phase-out deadline set by the high court wouldnt be extended indefinitely. There was no point living in fear that my auto would be seized. After all, this gives me my daily bread.        
	The majority of drivers said they were happy with their LPG autos, though availability of fuel remains a problem. I didnt use katatel (adulterated oil) even in my old auto but many of my colleagues did. All of us suffered from emission-related ailments. My eyes used to burn and I would have difficulty breathing at times. But with LPG being widely used now, I can feel that the Salt Lake air is cleaner, said Subodh Maiti, an auto driver on the Karunamoyee-City Centre route.        
	Many auto drivers who have switched to clean fuel, however, threaten to go back to easily available options like katatel unless the state government arranges for more LPG outlets in the township and its adjoining areas.        
	Salt Lake has only one LPG pump. We have to queue up for at least two hours for a refill, which means we lose both time and money. When the pump runs dry, we are stranded. We did what the government said; it should now set up more LPG stations to ensure that our livelihood is not affected, said a driver.        
	Other places in the North 24-Parganas like Barasat, Madhyamgram and Nagerbazar, where more than 2,500 licenced autos ply every day, do not have a single LPG refuelling station.         
	While many Salt Lake drivers are going green  properly or by proxy  the majority of the two-stroke fleet in town is standing its ground in anticipation of an escape route.        
	The government should extend the July 31 deadline or allow drivers to attach LPG kits to their two-stroke autos, said Sovandeb Chattopadhyay, a leader of the Trinamul-backed Auto Bachao Committee.

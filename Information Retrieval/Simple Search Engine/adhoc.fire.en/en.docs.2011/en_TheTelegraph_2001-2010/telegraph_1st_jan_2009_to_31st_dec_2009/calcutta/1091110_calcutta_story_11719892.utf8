                                                                            Tuesday , November 10 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Woman driver attacks traffic cop
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A woman motorist was arrested on Monday morning for attacking cops and snatching the wireless set of a traffic sergeant who tried to book her for a road rule violation.         
	Seema Ali Hossain, in her mid-30s, was arrested along with husband Nurul Amin, who arrived at the spot later and supported her. The couple were charged with preventing an officer from discharging his duties and theft. They were produced in a city court and released on bail.        
	According to the police, around 10.30am, traffic sergeant Milon Kumar Dam stopped Seema as she drove into a no-entry zone at the Cornfield Road-Rashbehari Avenue crossing. Dam asked for Seemas driving licence to book her for violating a traffic law.         
	She handed over her licence without any protest. As the sergeant proceeded to fill up the compound slip, the woman walked up to him, snatched the wireless set tucked under his belt and walked away, said a senior officer of the South East Traffic Guard.        
	Taken aback, Dam asked Seema to hand over the walkie-talkie, saying it was government property. I also told her she could move court if she felt she was being penalised unfairly, the officer said.         
	Seema, a resident of Tiljala Road, was allegedly in no mood to return the wireless set and called up her husband, a state government employee. Dam, in turn, called up his colleague posted at the Gariahat crossing and also asked the officer-in-charge of South East Traffic Guard, Sati Jiban Nath, to come to his aid.         
	Nurul soon joined his wife and protested against the cops decision to slap a fine on her.         
	We tried to explain to the woman why she was being booked and told her about the options available but she would just not listen. When Dam asked her to sign the fine slip, she tried to tear his uniform, Nath said.         
	The officers then called in woman constables from Green Police, who were on duty on Rashbehari Avenue. When constable Tapasi Mondal got inside Seemas car to take her to the nearest police station, Seema attacked her and took away one of her earrings, alleged an officer. Mondal was rushed to hospital and administered three stitches on her right earlobe, the officer added.         
	Finally, a team from Gariahat police station arrived at the spot and towed Seemas car away. The couple were taken to the police station, where we managed to retrieve the wireless set from the woman, said an officer of Gariahat police station.        
	The couples behaviour was extremely weird. We have not witnessed anything like this in recent times, he added.

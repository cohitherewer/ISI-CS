The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Poll army takes up position
                                                                                                               Poll army takes up position
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Bamboo poles piled up at the National Library on Sunday. (Sanat Kr Sinha)                                  
	Bamboo poles were drilled into the grounds of the abode of books on Sunday as the unofficial invasion of the National Library by the Election Commission (EC) turned aggressive on Sunday.        
	The first pandal was set up on the grounds and the old reading room was converted into the poll war room with electronic voting machines and election officials led by assistant returning officers A.K Singh and G.K. Gupta Roy.        
	When the EC had not notified the library authorities about the takeover, how were the election officials turning the Alipore address into their lair? Please do not ask me anything on that. Who permitted you to enter? demanded A.K Singh.        
	When told that the chief electoral officer Debashis Sen had said that the final decision was yet to be taken, G.K. Gupta Roy said that they would withdraw from the library premises if told to do so. We will move out if he (Sen) tells us to, but I think we will have to use the place, he stressed.        
	When Metro was clicking pictures of the poll preparations on the library campus, some EC officials, led by Singh, snatched the camera away. Why are you taking pictures? shouted Singh and handed back the digital camera only after deleting some pictures.        
	Metro has been running a campaign to try and convince the EC to spare the National Library and look for an alternative poll address in Alipore.        
	Pandals are being set up to accommodate hundreds of central forces. EVMs for two constituencies have already been kept in the old reading room, said an official without revealing his identity.        
	Library director K.K Banerjee said on Sunday that he had still not heard from the EC. Then why were the poll officials being allowed a free run of the campus?        
	What can I do? What would happen if (we stopped the election officials and) readers services got disrupted? said Banerjee.        
	Readers seemed resigned to yet another poll assault. The next couple of weeks will be a nightmare for us, shuddered Prashanta Mondal, a lecturer visiting the library on Sunday afternoon.

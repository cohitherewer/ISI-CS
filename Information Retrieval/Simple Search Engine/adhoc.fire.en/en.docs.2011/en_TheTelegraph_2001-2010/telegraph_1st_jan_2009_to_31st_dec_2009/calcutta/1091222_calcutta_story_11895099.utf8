	The Ramakrishna Mission held its 100th annual general meeting at Belur Math on Sunday. A release issued by the Mission, which was registered on May 4, 1909, says a new centre has been opened in Hatamaniguda in Rayagada, Orissa.        
	Among the projects launched over the past year are postgraduate (PG) courses in Bengali and chemistry at Vidyamandira in Belur and Vivekananda Centenary College in Rahara, respectively.        
	The School of Languages at the Institute of Culture, Gol Park, has started courses in Communicative German, Communicative Chinese and Business Chinese. Vivekananda Polyclinic in Lucknow has started offering PG training courses in plastic surgery and pathology, while Seva Pratishthan in Calcutta has opened a post-basic BSc nursing college. For school drop-outs, the Mission has launched an industry-sponsored skill training programme.        
	In the medical field, the Mission has started an MRI unit at Seva Pratishthan, a 24-bed orthopaedic ward at Vivekananda Polyclinic, a panchakarma therapy unit at Narendrapur and a physiotherapy unit at the Vrindaban dispensary.         
	As part of its rural development scheme, the Mission has distributed 200 bee-keeping boxes to villagers in Meghalaya; constructed two check-dams in Purulia and one check-dam and three lift-irrigation systems in Chhattisgarh; and renovated 25 dilapidated houses in North 24-Parganas.        
	The release also says that Ramakrishna Math has opened centres in Haripad (Kerala), Rajarhat Bishnupur (Calcutta) and St Petersburg (Russia). The Math has opened an audio-visual unit at the Kankurgachhi centre, a mobile medical service unit at the Barasat centre, an eye-care unit at the Rajkot centre and a youth awareness programme at the Ulsoor centre (Bangalore).

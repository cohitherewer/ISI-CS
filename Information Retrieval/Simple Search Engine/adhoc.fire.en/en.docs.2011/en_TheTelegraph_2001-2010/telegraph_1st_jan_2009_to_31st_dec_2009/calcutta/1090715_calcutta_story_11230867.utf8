                      A life devoted to drama                    Perhaps the greatest Indian theatre thinker and dramatist of the post-Independence era, Badal Sircar can rightly be called the innovator of contemporary Indian theatre. A civil engineer by profession, he began writing plays in the 1950s, dismayed by the paucity of good Bengali drama. With a flair for comedy and for catching the cadence, wit and everyday speech of middle-class Calcuttans, his early comedies have a flavour unique in Bengali literature. His first serious play Evam Indrajit (1963) attracted much attention for its striking originality and themes of absurdist meaninglessness, identity crisis and social conformity. It is perhaps the one contemporary Bengali drama most translated into other Indian languages. His concern in his plays is the pointlessness of existence, compounded by a sense of associative guilt and responsibility in disturbed persons, who belong to the urban middle-class and inhabit a world of increasing violence and inhumanity. In his later plays, Sircar wanted theatre to break the barriers between performer and spectator, performer and performer, spectator and spectator. According to him, theatre would be a collective exercise to awaken and enhance the social consciousness of participants, including viewers. Hosted by Natya Shodh Sansthan, Badal Utsava will pay tribute to the man through his works, besides exhibitions, lectures, video-screenings and tributes by theatre personalities. To be inaugurated today by Mohit Chattopadhyay, it commences with the opening of an exhibition on Badal Sircar to be followed by tributes by Amol Palekar, Baharul Islam, Girish Karnad, Kumar Roy, Samik Bandyopadhyay and others. This will be followed by the release of three books: Plays in a National Perspective (English), Badal Sircar: Sakshatkar Sangrahamala (Bengali) and Pravasi Ki Kalam Se (Hindi). Finally, Shatabdi will stage Khat Mat Kring (dir: Badal Sircar; 7 pm).                  Event: Festival in tribute to Badal Sircar When: July 15 - 19; 4 pm - 8 pm Where: Natya Bhavan, EE-8, Phase II, Bidhan Nagar

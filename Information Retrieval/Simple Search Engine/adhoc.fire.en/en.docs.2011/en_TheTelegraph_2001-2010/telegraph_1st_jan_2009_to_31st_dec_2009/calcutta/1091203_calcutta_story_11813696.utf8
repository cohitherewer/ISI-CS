                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      One step up for jobless

	Dirpal Kaur, the son of a truck driver, had been unemployed for four years before he joined Smile Twin e-learning Programme (SteP), a six-month vocational training module for young people run by NGO, Smile Foundation. The 22-year-old now works in a BPO in Sector V.        
	Dipankar Das, a B.Com graduate, was frustrated after being unable to find a job. After completing his training at SteP, he was placed in a private firm.        
	Smile Foundation was started in 2002 with 40 MNC employees. The founders wanted to give something back to society in return for what they had received. The NGO identifies grassroots-level initiatives that need assistance and makes them self-sustaining, said Naresh Chaudhuri, the chief operating officer. The NGO now has projects in 22 states.         
	Smiles Mission Education programme focuses on school-level education. We provide pre-primary level and supplementary coaching to first-generation learners, said Chytali Chakraborty, the manager, corporate social responsibility, of Smile Foundation. The programme partners with a local NGO in Mullickpur, South 24 Parganas, and another in Hind Motor.        
	But we realised that it is not enough to educate youngsters. So we began SteP, for which we have tied up with Cafe Coffee Day, Westside, Airtel and Vodafone and BPOs for entry-level jobs for trainees, said Chaudhuri.

	At SteP, the thrust is on spoken English, basic computer skills and retail management. Presently, Smile has one SteP centre in Dum Dum Cantonment. The target age group is from 18 to 25. We charge a nominal fee from those who can afford it. The minimum eligibility requirement is a pass mark in Class X or XII board exams, explained Chakraborty. Sixteen out of 20 have been placed from the first batch that started in January this year, she added.        
	Our next plan is to bridge the gap between the privileged and the underprivileged, explained Chakraborty. The Action for Kids project, started with this objective in mind, involves underprivileged kids visiting schools to speak to students on their rights. Kids have already visited schools like La Martiniere for Girls and Julien Day School, Elgin Road.         
	A walkathon organised by Smile from Madhusudan Mancha to South City International School on November 13 saw students from privileged backgrounds walking side by side with their underprivileged counterparts to raise awareness on the subject.

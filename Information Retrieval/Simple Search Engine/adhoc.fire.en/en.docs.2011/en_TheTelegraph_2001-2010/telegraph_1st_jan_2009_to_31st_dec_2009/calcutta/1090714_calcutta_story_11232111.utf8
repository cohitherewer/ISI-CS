                                                                                                               JEE scripts plea before high court
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	A high court division bench on Monday refused to stay an order asking the state JEE board to produce the answer scripts of three examinees.        
	The bench of Justice K.J. Sengupta and Justice M.A. Ghani, however, admitted an appeal moved by the board against the order by Justice D. Dutta of the high court directing it to show the answer scripts to the petitioner students and the court against a deposit of Rs 5,000 each.        
	Subhasish Kesh, Sammilani Bhattacharya and Soumya Konar, who had appeared for this years JEE and were not satisfied with their ranks, had moved the court, wanting to see their answer scripts.        
	Subhasish, who did well in the HS, ranked 18,136 on the engineering merit list and did not make it to the medical list. Justice Dutta, after hearing his petition, had asked the board to produce his answer scripts before the court on July 13.        
	The judge had passed similar orders in the other two cases.        
	On Monday, Subrata Mukhopadhaya, standing counsel for the state who appeared for the board, informed Justice Dutta that his client had moved a plea against the order, seeking an interim injunction. Justice Dutta adjourned the hearing.        
	The division bench refused to hear the prayer and fixed July 15 as the date of hearing.        
	The lawyers representing the petitioners claimed that since the bench did not grant an interim injunction, the board should produce the answer scripts before Justice Dutta on Tuesday.        
	Mukhopadhaya said that since the division bench had admitted the case for hearing, his client was not bound to show the answer scripts to the petitioners.

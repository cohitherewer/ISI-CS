The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bowled over by Ponting
                                                                                                               Bowled over by Ponting
          KUSHALI NAG                          Ruhi Dutta with Ricky Ponting during the advertisement shoot                                  
	Ruhi Dutta thought cricket was a boring game not worth watching, till Ricky Ponting said hi to her.        
	The 23-old model-turned-actress, who got up close with the Aussie skipper for an ad shoot in town, is now a cricket addict.        
	When I met Ricky Ponting on the first day of the shoot my heart started beating fast. But when I went up to him he smiled at me and said hi. I was completely bowled over as he had no attitude at all, gushes the Garia girl.        
	When they met to shoot a commercial for Valvoline Lubricants, at Lake Land Country Club, Ricky started off by asking Ruhi what her profession was and where she lived.         
	He was very down to earth and very easy on the sets. Though he never spoke a word on cricket I slowly developed a liking for the game, all thanks to him, smiled the Garia girl, who treasures a few photographs with Ponting she took.        
	Since Ricky happened, Ruhi has hardly missed a Kolkata Knight Riders or Team India match. Ponting will always be special, but now Dada and Dhoni are my favourite cricketers, says the lights-camera-action girl who has done two item numbers in Tollywood films and has now bagged her first role.        
	The KKR fan was very disappointed with her teams showing in this years IPL, but is hoping that the Korbo Lorbo Jeetbo Re theme song rings true with Sourav Ganguly and Ricky Ponting leading the way.

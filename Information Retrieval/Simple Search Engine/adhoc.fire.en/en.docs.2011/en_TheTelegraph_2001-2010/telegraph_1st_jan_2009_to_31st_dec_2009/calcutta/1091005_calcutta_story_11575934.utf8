                      The search goes on...                    An ordinary German family flees from the advancing Russian army in 1945. Fearing for their safety, the family members place their first-born son Arnold into the arms of a refugee, losing both of them amidst the crowd. The family makes it to safety and starts over, painstakingly building a new life in the post-war economic miracle. But losing Arnold continues to haunt them. Arnold isnt dead. He didnt starve, either, is what his little brother, the narrator of the story, Lost, is finally told by his parents when he is about eight years old. I was just beginning to understand that Arnold, my un-dead brother, had the leading role in the family, and had assigned me a supporting part. The search for Arnold goes on. Finding the lost Arnold is his parents dream. And his little brothers nightmare. The novel, written by Hans-Ulrich Treichel, has been translated into 21 languages and made into a film. This evening, the author presents a reading from the book in a session that will evoke memories of life in post World War II Germany as well as make the audience feel the emotional devastation experienced by any war-torn family. Prior to this, the novelist, who is also a renowned poet and essayist, will speak on Contemporary German Literature  Writing Styles and Trends, exemplified by select works of young authors from the Leipziger Literaturinstitut.

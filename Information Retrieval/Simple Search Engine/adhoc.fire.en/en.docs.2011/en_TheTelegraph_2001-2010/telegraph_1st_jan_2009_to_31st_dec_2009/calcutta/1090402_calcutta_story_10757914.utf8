  - Students want resignations          A STAFF REPORTER                          Policemen on the SRFTI campus on EM Bypass on Wednesday. Picture by Aranya Sen                                        
	The Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute has been indefinitely shut after students gheraoed senior officials for nearly 24 hours from Tuesday afternoon demanding their resignation.         
	The management of SRFTI will issue a notice on Thursday suspending classes and all other activities on the campus as the atmosphere isnt conducive. The protesters are flexing muscles over minor issues, said an administrative official on Wednesday evening.        
	Earlier, the students allowed director Swapan Mullick, dean Adinath Das, administrative officer Sudhin Banerjee and the head of purchase, Santanu Basu Mullick, to step out of the campus only after they agreed to hold a governing council meeting by April 10 to decide on the future of the current administrative body.        
	Students said their primary demand was better faculty and equipment in the cinematography and direction departments.        
	Mullick told Metro on Wednesday evening: Students cannot call a general council meeting and decide who should sit on the chair. They have not given me a charter of demands. The meeting will depend on the availability of the chairman and members of the I amp;B ministry.        
	He described the agitation as a non-issue.        
	Three days ago, a bunch of drunk students broke windows of the administrative building. When disciplinary action was taken against them, they wreaked havoc on campus and confined us in a room for 24 hours. We were abused and humiliated. Their only demand was our resignation, said dean Das.         
	We have been asked not to step on the campus before the general council meeting, which will discuss the issue of our resignation. We are talking to the ministry, added Das.        
	The four officials were shifted from the directors room to the institute guest house after midnight on Wednesday. They refused the food offered by students.        
	By Wednesday afternoon, the RAF was withdrawn and some faculty members were allowed into the room where the officials were held captive.

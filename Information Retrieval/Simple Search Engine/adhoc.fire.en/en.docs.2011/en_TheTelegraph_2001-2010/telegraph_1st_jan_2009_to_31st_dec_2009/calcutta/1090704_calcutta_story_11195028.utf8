                      A literary evening                    Having earned international acclaim as a playwright, poet, actor, director, critic, and translator, Girish Karnad can, perhaps, be rightly labelled the modern Indian renaissance man. He began his literary career with the Kannada play Yahati (1961), an ironical piece which chronicled the adventures of mythical characters from the Mahabharata. An instant success, it was immediately translated and staged in several other Indian languages. Tughlaq (1964), a compelling allegory of the Nehruvian era, established Karnad as one of the most promising playwrights in the country. Since then, Karnad has continued to compose top-notch plays, often using history and mythology to tackle contemporary themes. He has also forayed into the world of cinema, working alternately as an actor, director and screenwriter, earning numerous awards along the way. He is also the latest of seven recipients of Jnanpith Award for Kannada, the highest literary honour conferred in our country. This evening, he will take part in a conversation with Sangeeta Dutta, in whose directorial venture Life Goes On, he has recently acted as protagonist. Karnad will also recite from Jibanananda Das Bonolata Sen, as well as discuss at length on his recent plays.                    Event: A conversation between Girish Karnad and Sangeeta Datta When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Weavers Studio Centre for the Arts, 94 Ballygunge Place

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Court admits Riz case plea
                                                                                                               Court admits Riz case plea
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Friday accepted a petition which it had rejected two-and-a-half months ago, following a statement by Assembly Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim.        
	The petition, filed by city-based NGO Empathy 09, seeks an order asking the CBI to issue chargesheets against Trinamul MLA Javed Khan, police officer Gyanwant Singh and Shaidur Rahman in the Rizwanur Rahman death case.        
	The petitioner has claimed that Rizwanur had named uncle Shaidur and the other two in his suicide note as being responsible for his death.        
	When the petition was first moved on February 20, the bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice B. Somadder rejected it on two grounds.        
	The bench had observed that since the plea was based on newspaper reports and Empathy 09 was not an affected party, the petition was untenable.        
	But when the same plea was moved on Friday, the bench of Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice S.P. Mitra accepted it for hearing. The organisation stated in the new petition that the issue was raised in the Assembly as a motion on November 20 last year by Rabin Mondal (CPM).        
	While disposing of the motion, the speaker had observed that it was tragic and unfortunate that the court did not ask the CBI to file chargesheets against Khan, Singh and Rahman.... The speaker expressed the hope that the court would reconsider the matter in future, petitioners lawyer Bhaskar Ghosh said.        
	After hearing the submission, the bench decided to hear the case next Friday.

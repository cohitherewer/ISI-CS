                      Tryst with a master artist                    Satish Gujral never fails to surprise. Even at 84 and after a career spanning close to six decades, his artistic spirit is never at rest, creating continuously in response to his inner voice. One of the pioneers of contemporary Indian art in the post-Independence era, he is internationally acclaimed for his multi-talents of painting, graphics, sculpture, murals, architecture and interior design. Entombed in silence in his early years as a result of a hearing impairment, he would draw and read Urdu literature, and in 1939 joined the Mayo School of Art in Lahore. In 1944 he joined the JJ School of Art in Bombay where he came in touch with the Progressive Artists Group. Unable to accept their European vocabulary or their techniques, he searched for a more traditional Indian modernism. He is also known for his large murals, commissioned around India and abroad. Times Whirlwind, the ongoing solo exhibition of works by the master artist, provides art connoisseurs a taste of his genius and the opportunity to experience the magic of Gujral after a very long time. Featuring an impressive collection of eight drawings, 20 paintings and 21 bronze sculptures, as well as four of his trademark burnt-wood creations, the basic theme of all these works is mechanism and play  a theme very close to the artists heart, as he has a special knack for sport and loves taking the risks involved in it.

           Howrah bridge illuminated. A Telegraph picture                                   
	lThe article Bridge the gap, July 26, 2009, was interesting, informative and insightful. But belonging to the Howrah bridge people, and a die-hard admirer with a fair collection of pictures of the bridge right from its pontoon days (incidentally the bridge on the river Kwai bears a resemblance to the pontoon bridge), I found the accompanying picture of the Howrah bridge disappointing. The magic of this symphony in steel was missing.

	The tribute to Tarak Nath Sen, former professor of English at Presidency College, brought cheer to my mind (In memory of Mastermoshai, July 12, 2009). I had the good fortune of attending the legendary professors lectures. Between 1960-62, while doing my post-graduate studies in English from Calcutta University, we were allowed to attend classes taken by TNS (as he was popularly referred to) at Presidency College.             
	A tall person with a frail frame clad in spotless dhoti-panjabi, he would create a sensation among the students with his very entry.

	Apropos A dogs life, August 2, 2009, the article has rightly pointed out some unfortunate facts of canine treatment and allied matters in our city. I agree that private vet clinics are not well-equipped, dog creches are inadequate in numbers and that no vet laboratory facility is available in the city except at the West Bengal University of Animal amp; Fishery Sciences, Belgachhia.             
	However, I am shocked to read a comment by someone from the North Calcutta Kennel Club that most vets lack confidence about surgery. I would humbly request the person to visit the Block Animal Health Centre of any district in West Bengal, where he can see how animal surgery is managed by the lone vet posted there. The vet has to manage the treatment of all species of animals. Treatment includes surgery. Besides, vets have sufficient knowledge about the fact that surgical cases cannot be treated with medicine alone.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mart revamp gobbles road 
                                                                                                               Mart revamp gobbles road 
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                              
	The revamp of the College Street market has threatened the existence of a north Calcutta road.        
	Ishan Bose Lane, which separated blocks A and B of the erstwhile market, seems to have been made part of Varnaparichay, a mall which will replace the earlier structure.        
	Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya asserted that the road would be open to the public after the mall was unveiled but a source in Bengal Shelter, the private partner in the revamp, said Ishan Bose Lane had been shown as an integral part of Varnaparichay in the layout sanctioned by the civic body.        
	Samar Nag, the managing director of Bengal Shelter, could not be contacted over the phone.        
	In the layout, a copy of which is with Metro, the lane has been marked as Common Passage, unlike the space surrounding the market which has been shown as  Common Passage (For Public Use).        
	The 12ft-wide lane, which was clearly marked in the map of the city prepared by Colonel Smart from 1903 to 1909, was an access road to the College Street market from Madan Mohan Burman Street.        
	Now, as part of the revamp, the space below the road is part of the integrated basement car park of the mall. The lane has been elevated by five feet and a slope at either end will align it with Madan Mohan Burman Street and Bidhan Sarani.        
	According to the plan, there will be a 16ft headroom over the passage, above which the two blocks of the market will be joined.        
	An official of the civic body who did not want to be named said the part of the mall above the lane had been designated Block C. Given the layout, it seems unlikely pedestrians or motorists will be allowed to use the lane once the mall is opened, the official said.        
	Joint civic commissioner Sahidul Islam, overseeing the revamp through public private partnership, said: The road was not much in use. The mall is coming up after living a common passage. He, however, has no clue whether the common passage would be open to the public.        
	Traders at College Street market, temporarily relocated to Marcus Square, have threatened an agitation if Ishan Bose Lane is taken over by the mall. We will start an agitation if the mayor does not take steps to return the road to the people. It is peoples property and no one can sell it, said Ajay Kumar Datta, a trader at the market.

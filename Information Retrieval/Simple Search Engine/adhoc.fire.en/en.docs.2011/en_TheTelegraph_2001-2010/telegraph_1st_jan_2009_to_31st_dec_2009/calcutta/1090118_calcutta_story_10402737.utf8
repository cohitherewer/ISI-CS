The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Love for theatre
                                                                                                               Love for theatre

	Second only to his love of films was Tapan Sinhas love for theatre.         
	A regular viewer, he drew most of his actors from group theatre and the commercial stage: Tulsi Lahiri, Bhanu Bandyopadhyay, Kumar Roy, Robi Ghosh, Ajitesh Bandyopadhyay, Utpal Dutt, Manoj Mitra and members of Rangakarmee.         
	Sinha had got Manmatho Roy to help out with the script of Khudhito Pashan. In Sinhas house several playwrights would read their works: Santosh Kumar Ghosh read Ajatak and Soumitra Chattopadhyay read Praan Tapasya. Manoj Mitra read out his plays between Sajano Bagan and Chander Andharey to the late filmmaker.         
	Sinha discussed plays with Mitra in the intensive care unit only a few days before his death on January 15, wanting to listen to Bhelai Bhashe Sita and write the music for Chander Andharey. He wrote four songs for one of Mitras plays, Galpo Hekim Saheb and got Haimanti Shukla to sing them.         
	I hadnt thought of which songs to use, but when he heard the play, Tapanda offered to write Mohar Bais songs, says Mitra.         
	His passion for music had led to several gems, such as the songs of Harmonium and Banchharamer Bagan. Rehearsals were held in his house. Tapanda hired musicians and instruments like the sarengi.         
	A bit expensive for our group Sundaram, but the songs complement the mood and setting of the play, Mitra adds.       SEBANTI SARKAR

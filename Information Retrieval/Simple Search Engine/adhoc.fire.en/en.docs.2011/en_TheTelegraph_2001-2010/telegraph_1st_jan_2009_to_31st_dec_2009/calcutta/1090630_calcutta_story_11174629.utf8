The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Day in jail for poll car official 
                                                                                                               Day in jail for poll car official 
          OUR BUREAU                                    (From top) Sachin Haldar, his Tata Safari, and SDO Mohammed Shahid				                                 
	Calcutta High Court on Monday held Mohammed Shahid, the sub-divisional officer (SDO) of Canning, guilty of contempt for not carrying out the order to return Sachin Haldars Tata Safari, grabbed for election duty, and sentenced him to one days civil imprisonment.        
	The SDO, who was also an election officer, had requisitioned Haldars new SUV on April 23 for the Lok Sabha polls, despite the car-owners pleas and protests.        
	Metro had run a sustained campaign to highlight Haldars fight against the poll machinery to get his car back.        
	The 51-year-old rice trader who had bought the Tata Safari to help his wife Gayatri undertake a weekly 54km journey to visit a dermatologist as she suffers from severe sun rashes, decided not to be bullied and petitioned the high court.        
	On May 4, Justice Sanjib Banerjee had ordered SDO Shahid to immediately return the vehicle (WB 20U-0141).        
	The Representation of the People Act, 1951, empowers the Election Commission to requisition public and commercial vehicles for poll purposes. But requisitioning vehicles meant for personal use is contrary to the provisions of the act, the judge had said.        
	But Haldar did not get back his SUV till May 16, after the completion of the poll process. He had moved a contempt petition on May 11.        
	The court held the SDO guilty of contempt, and for the first time sentenced a senior government official to jail for not returning a car requisitioned for poll duty.        
	Justice Banerjee, however, stayed the operation of the order for a fortnight after the lawyers representing the SDO informed him that the appeal against the May 4 order was pending before a division bench of the court.        
	When Metro contacted SDO Shahid on Monday afternoon, he said: I was just following the rules for requisition of poll vehicles.... If necessary, I shall appeal against the order.        
	The David who took on  and felled  a Goliath, hoped that this case would serve as an example and safeguard the interests of car-owners from the poll monster.        
	I want that the law should be framed in such a manner that in future no one is harassed like I was, Haldar told Metro on Monday.        
	SDO Shahid was present in the courtroom on Monday when Justice Banerjee pronounced his verdict.        
	My client gave an unconditional apology but the court rejected it, said junior standing counsel for the state, Subrata Mukhopadhyay.        
	The law has taken its own course. But it is not the end. Our appeal against the order of Justice Banerjee is pending before the division bench. It is likely to be heard on Tuesday, added Mukhopadhyay.        
	But why had his client not followed the courts order and returned Haldars SUV?        
	The car was requisitioned for the use of an election observer. So, we moved an appeal on May 7 before a division bench. It was fixed for hearing on May 21. But on May 21, the division bench said that since the election was over, there was no need to hear the matter urgently, recounted Mukhopadhyay.

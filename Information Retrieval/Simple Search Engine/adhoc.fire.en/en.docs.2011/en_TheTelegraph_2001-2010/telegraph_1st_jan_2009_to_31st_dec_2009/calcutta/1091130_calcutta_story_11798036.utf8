                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Police plan to plug Writers security gaps
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Police have asked the government to shift the 61 families living in Writers Buildings elsewhere to boost the security of the state secretariat.         
	The cops have also recommended that visitors who enter Writers through the VIP gate be stopped from walking through the same portico that ministers use.        
	In a recent letter to home secretary Ardhendu Sen, police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti explained why families should not be allowed to stay on the Writers premises, said sources.         
	The families are of maintenance employees of the state secretariat, responsible for switching off lights, operating pumps and other tasks.         
	The letter has spelt out possible threats, weaknesses in the existing security arrangements and recommended steps to plug the gaps.        
	According to the police, maintenance employees can be allowed to stay back at Writers only on special days.        
	After office hours, when the number of security personnel goes down, it becomes difficult to maintain vigil both inside and outside Writers, said a senior official of the state home department.         
	R.K. Pachnanda, the special commissioner of police overseeing security, refused comment.         
	Sources said cops had proposed another entrance near the portico so that visitors did not use the VIP gate, meant for ministers. There are seven other gates at Writers.        
	Even the two lifts, earmarked for visitors and VIPs, have to be separated. Besides, there must be a public address system, said an official.        
	The recommendations follow a recent recce of Writers security by Sen and some senior police officers.        
	Also on the recommendation list are doorframe metal detectors on the second floor of the main block, where offices of high-profile ministers are located, and frisking of visitors outside the block.        
	A visitor who manages to enter the building can now walk into a ministers chamber or the police control room. There are not even closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras on the second floor, said a police officer.         
	Cops also want to increase the number of security personnel at Writers.

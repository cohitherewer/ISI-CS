The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Crackdown in cracker wake
                                                                                                               Crackdown in cracker wake
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Saturday, till 10 pm: 17 arrests.    Saturday, from 10.30pm till post-midnight: 1,067 arrests.        
	Fireworks frenzy gave way to cop crackdown late on Saturday after a push from chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.        
	We have arrested 1,067 persons from the city for violating the norms of decibel limit, and seized 676kg of banned crackers in the night raids, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police, headquarters.        
	Another 150 offenders were rounded up from Salt Lake and the citys fringes.        
	Police named Alipore, Burrabazar, Belgachhia, Girish Park, Behala, Tiljala, Topsia, Park Circus, Kasba, Jadavpur and the Bypass as some of the loudest zones.        
	Among the offenders were some businessmen and a doctor with a prominent healthcare unit, said an officer.         
	As the police went on the rampage, picking up residents of highrises in random raids, allegations of highhandedness abounded.        
	My son wasnt even bursting crackers, but he was caught, dragged to the jeep and harassed for two hours at the police station, said a businessman in Alipore.        
	Another business family, off Ballygunge Circular Road, alleged that their teenaged domestic help was picked up for no reason and let off only after paying a hefty bribe.        
	A resident of a highrise off Theatre Road said: We were enjoying a display of legitimate fireworks when suddenly, a police team arrived, grabbed an innocent boy as if he was a criminal, dragged him away and put him behind bars. Who gives cops the right to behave like such brutes?        
	Things took an ugly turn in Salt Lake, where seven members of a business family were arrested early on Sunday for allegedly attacking five policemen and molesting a female constable who had entered their house to stop them from bursting firecrackers.        
	Cops slapped charges of attempt to murder, theft and outrage of modesty against the seven male members of the Churiwala home in CE Block. They were remanded in judicial custody till October 31.        
	When cops entered the house, following complaints from neighbours, and told them not to burst crackers, they attacked the police team and molested a female constable, said Debabrata Das, the additional superintendent of police at Bidhannagar.        
	Defence lawyer Sanjay Saha however said the plainclothed cops had heckled the Churiwalas on being asked to show their ID cards and a search warrant.        
	This was nothing but a case of police dadagiri, alleged a friend of the Churiwala. Are we living in a city where the cops can invade any home and treat innocent citizens like terrorists?        
	Amidst all the sound and fury, what was loud and clear was the failure of the police to prevent the sale and use of banned crackers for Diwali.        
	It appears that there were lapses when we initiated a pre-Diwali check to seize banned crackers. Besides, our counterparts in adjoining districts also did not initiate a proper drive, said an officer.         
	Its practically impossible to keep an eye on each building in the city. Unless the supply line of banned firecrackers is cut off completely, the decibel ban will be tough to impose, said a senior officer of New Alipore police station.        
	So, banned crackers enjoyed a free run on Saturday evening  till they made the chief minister see red.        
	What spoilt your Diwali  the bursting of banned crackers or the cop crackdown? ttmetroabpmail.com

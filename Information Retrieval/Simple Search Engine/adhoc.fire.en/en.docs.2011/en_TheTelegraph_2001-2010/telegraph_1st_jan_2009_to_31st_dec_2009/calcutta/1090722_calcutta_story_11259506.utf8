                      Heal the world                    The story of Midas, ancient Greek king of Pessinus and his desire for gold, is a well-known fable. On being granted a gift by Dionysus, the God of Life, he asks for the power to turn whatever he touches, to gold. Having enjoyed his gift for a short time, he soon realises his own folly when he can no longer eat anything, as his food turns to gold as soon as he touches it. Finally, when he accidentally turns his daughter to gold, he is filled with grief. He begs Dionysus to take back his power, which he does, but his daughter perishes all the same. Comparing this story with the modern human predicament, artist Sharbani Das Gupta portrays works that depict the way man has destroyed nature in his greed for power and wealth. King Midas amp; His Dinner, the ongoing show, features ceramic works that highlight how pollution, destruction and devastation of the environment has made modern man very much like King Midas, crazy with hunger, but unable to eat the toxic food that he has produced as a result of his own greed. While gold is a figurative representation of our relentless search for material gain, another shocking parallel is drawn between Midas daughter, who perishes in the wake of his terrible desire, and our own children, whose future we are endangering to satisfy our own selfish needs. The show serves as a timely reminder to all conscientious citizens the need to protect the world and urges them to nourish and nurture its resources for the future of the human race.                  Event: Ceramic and visual art works by Sharbani Das Gupta When: Till July 24; 10 am - 7 pm Where: Weavers Studio Centre for the arts, 94 Ballygunge Place

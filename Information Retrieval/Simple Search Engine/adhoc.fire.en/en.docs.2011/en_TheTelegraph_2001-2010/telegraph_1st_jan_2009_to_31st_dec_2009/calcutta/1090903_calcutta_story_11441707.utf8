The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hush-up bid ends in surrender
                                                                                                               Hush-up bid ends in surrender
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Ram Singh, the driver of the police van that hit 44-year-old homemaker Payal Golani on Free School Street on Sunday, surrendered before the chief metropolitan magistrate after being charged with rash and negligent driving on Wednesday.        
	Metro reported on Wednesday how the police had tried to hush up the matter by promising to bear the treatment cost of the homemaker if she did not lodge a complaint and had only made an entry in the motor collision register of Park Street police station (Cops in lady mishap hush-up).        
	Singh has been booked under sections 279 (rash and negligent driving) and 383 (causing grievous injury) of the IPC. The case will be transferred to New Market police station as the accident took place in the area under its jurisdiction, said an officer of Park Street police station.         
	Payal is recuperating in a nursing home after suffering compound fractures in the left foot, dislocation of joints and concussion.        
	Jitesh, a relative of Payal, contacted Metro on Monday after the cops allegedly offered to only arrange for a discount on the nursing home bill of over Rs 1 lakh. On Tuesday, Jitesh claimed that the matter had been settled.         
	We will treat the Park Street police station case as an FIR and the driver will be arrested. A chargesheet will also be filed against him and he would be produced before the court, said an officer of New Market police station.        
	He expressed surprise that Park Street police kept them in the dark about the accident. The victims family members were tight-lipped on Wednesday. The police have asked us not to talk to the media, said a family member.

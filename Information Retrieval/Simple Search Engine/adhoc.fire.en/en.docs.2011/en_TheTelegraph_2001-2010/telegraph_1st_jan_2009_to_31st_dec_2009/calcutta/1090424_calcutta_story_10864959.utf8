                                                                                                               Exam results on track
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The results of all major school-leaving examinations will be announced between May 20 and 30, officials said on Thursday, allaying fears of delays caused by the polls, a teacher boycott and a rescheduled paper.        
	Close to 13.6 lakh examinees in the state are awaiting their Madhyamik, Higher Secondary, ICSE, ISC and CBSE class X and XII results.        
	The West Bengal Board of Secondary Education and the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education made it clear that the involvement of Madhyamik and Higher Secondary teachers in poll duty would not slow down the process.        
	We are not in a position to confirm the exact date, but we are confident that the Madhyamik results will be declared by May 29, the day the results were announced last year, said Partha Roy, the secretary of the board of secondary education.        
	Many schools throughout the state will be taken over by the Election Commission for the polls on April 30, May 7 and May 13.        
	We dont think the elections will affect the process, stressed Roy.         
	Swapan Sarkar, the secretary of the Higher Secondary council, said neither the polls nor the ongoing boycott by computer teachers affecting evaluation of answer scripts in computer science and computer applications would delay the results.        
	We are making alternative arrangements to get the computer science and computer application answer scripts examined. We are targeting May 20, the day Higher Secondary results were declared last year, said Sarkar.         
	The fear of the ICSE and ISC results being delayed by the rescheduling of a paper was also put to rest by a council official.        
	The ICSE geography exam, scheduled for March 24 had to be pushed back to April 2 after the question paper was wrongly opened at a centre in Bangalore on March 23.        
	The results will be declared any day after May 18 and latest by May 24, the official said. The results were announced on May 20 last year.        
	A source in the CBSE said the results would be out in the third week of May.

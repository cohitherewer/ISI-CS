The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Kitchen budget battles blues
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Kitchen budget battles blues
  - Food prices go hop, skip and jump        OUR BUREAU                                                   
	Winter is here but the heat is on at the marketplace with food prices rising, along with the Celsius.        
	The price rise that has triggered heated arguments in Parliament and two bandhs in quick succession in Bengal, is hitting the homemaker the hardest in the battle to balance the household budget.        
	Prices of edibles have shot through the roof. Today, I bought fish and pulses at double the price I had paid a few months ago. Our family budget has never been affected so badly by price rise, said 30-year-old homemaker Mitali Chatterjee, who lives with her husband and two kids in a BB Ganguly Street flat.        
	Prices of almost all vegetables and fruits have steadily increased in the past few months, along with that of fish and meat.        
	Official data released on Thursday revealed food inflation, which indicates the rate of change in food prices, stood at 17.47 per cent in the third week of November against 15.58 per cent a week ago.        
	Regular visitors to city markets dont need the official inflation figures to feel the price rise pinch. (See box.)         
	Thirty-one-year-old Paulami Roy, a homemaker and mother of two, explained how the surge in prices have spoilt her budget. Paulami used to spend around Rs 100 on vegetables, eggs and fish but daily expenditure for the Roys, who live on Prince Anwar Shah Road and have two cars, on these items has gone up to around Rs 200-300 in less than six months. Her monthly grocery bills have risen from Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000-plus.        
	We have the habit of buying plum cake and brownies from Nahoums every Christmas. I went to Nahoums on Wednesday, but the price of the brownies was forbidding, said Paulami, whose husband, a techie, did not get his annual increments this year.         
	Reduced spending on entertainment and non-priority options  eating out less, avoiding a trip to the plexes for a Bollywood biggie in the first weekend, shorter vacations and need-based purchase of garments and cosmetics  are some of the strategies homemakers have adopted to beat the budget blues.        
	But budget management for those like Mitali or Paulami may get tougher if the fears of economists  rising food prices have a tendency to affect prices of manufacturing sector output  come true.        
	After the release of the food inflation numbers on Thursday, C. Rangarajan, the chairman of the Prime Ministers economic panel, said: This will require monetary action by the RBI, especially (money) supply management.        
	By sucking out excess liquidity from the system, the government can manage demand and soften prices if the supply line remains smooth. Till the government gets into the act of price management, which will have a delayed impact on household budgets, consumers will continue to reel under the price burden.        
	We have a wedding in the family next week. When we had booked a caterer six months ago he was charging Rs 380 per plate, but now he has raised it to Rs 410 because of the rise in prices of all ingredients, said Subhro Basu, a resident of Bhowanipore.         
	Most restaurants have till now resisted any upward revision of prices by squeezing their profit margins. We are absorbing the effect of the price hike. The price of everything from gas to oil, onion to green vegetables has gone up. But we cant increase our prices, because the customers would not like that, said Debashish Ghosh of Speciality Restaurants, which owns Mainland China and more.        
	But the cap on prices may not last long. We are supposed to change our menu later this month and we may be forced to increase prices by Rs 5-10 per dish, said Ghosh.

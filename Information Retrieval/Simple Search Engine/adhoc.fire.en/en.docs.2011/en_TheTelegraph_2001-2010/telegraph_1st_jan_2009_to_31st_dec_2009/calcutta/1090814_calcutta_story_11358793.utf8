The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Chief secy spills ban beans
                                                                                                               Chief secy spills ban beans
          OUR BUREAU                              
	A significant number of two-stroke autos, banned by the high court, are still plying in and around the city, chief secretary Ashok Mohan Chakrabarti said on Thursday.         
	I have been hearing this from you and other sources that a significant number of autos under purview of the ban are still plying. They can be seen not just on the fringes but in the city proper as well, Chakrabarti said on Day 13 of the ban.        
	Metro has been reporting over the past 13 days that several thousand two-stroke autos are ferrying passengers in the city and on the fringes while cops are looking the other way.         
	The seizure count, as on Thursday, reads four autos, two taxis, one bus and six goods carriages.         
	Chakrabarti, however, said the government will and must execute the ban order. I will make sure steps are taken to put an end to the practice (of plying banned vehicles), said Chakrabarti. He refused to comment when asked about the steps in detail.         
	The chief secretary expressed satisfaction over the conspicuously lower level of pollution in and around the city in the first fortnight since the ban came into effect.         
	Theres no denying that the number of polluting vehicles has come down drastically. This has resulted in conspicuously lower pollution levels in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area, he said.                     
	Asked about commuters inconvenience because of the lower vehicle count, Chakrabarti said: Things will ease with time. By the end of this month there will be 100 new buses... and a good number of owners of old commercial vehicles will have switched to newer vehicles.         
	Transport operators, unsure of the outcome of their appeal against the ban pending in the Supreme Court, have drafted a list of demands to be placed before the government to expedite the replacement of commercial vehicles 15 years and older with new ones.         
	Since relief from the Supreme Court will take some time coming, we have decided to go ahead with the replacement process as of now, said Swarnakamal Saha, the chief of the Banijyik Paribahan Bachao Committee.         
	The committee, he added, wants the government to speed up the process by removing red tape and middlemen and by ensuring that banks process loan applications fast. We will soon hand over a charter of demands to the transport department, said Saha.

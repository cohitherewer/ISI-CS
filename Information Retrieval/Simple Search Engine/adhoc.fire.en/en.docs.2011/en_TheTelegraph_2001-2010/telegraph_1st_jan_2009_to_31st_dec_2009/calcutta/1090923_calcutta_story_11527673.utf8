The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pandals switch on green light
                                                                                                               Pandals switch on green light

	The downturn and frequent power cuts have forced several puja committees to think out of the box and opt for the save power, save money mode.         
	Manicktala Chaltabagan Lohapatty has switched to solar lights and LEDs to decorate its pandal.        
	Twenty solar lamps have been installed outside the pandal. Solar lights comprise 80 per cent of our illumination this year. In these days of frequent power cuts, they are a dependable source of illumination, said Ashok Jaiswal, the vice-president of Manicktala Chaltabagan Lohapatty puja committee.        
	What if the sky remains overcast on the festive days? We have back-up energy for three days. We are also installing a wind generator which will last us another two days, said Anupam Boral, the managing director of Geetanjali Solar Enterprise, which is installing the lights at the Maniktala puja.         
	The puja at College Square, known for its illumination, has switched to LEDs. The benefit of LEDs is that they consume less power but have better effects. Last year, we had to shell out Rs 1,50,000 for electricity. The bill will be much less this year, said Bikash Mazumdar, the general secretary of the College Square puja committee.         
	Ahiritola Sarbojanin, too, is going the LED way, from the pandal to the gates. Netaji Sporting Club in Lake Town has increased the use of LEDs by 25 per cent. LEDs mean less electrical pollution, too, stressed Netaji Sporting Club member Bapi Kundu.         
	The carbon emitted by LEDs is much less compared with incandescent lights and sodium vapour lamps, said S.P. Gon Chaudhury, the managing director of West Bengal Green Energy Development Corporation.         
	The puja in Kashi Bose Lane, near Hedua, is themed on glass to ensure maximum effect with minimum lighting. The aim is to cut down the power load from 14KW (last year) to 8-10KW, said puja secretary Chandra Shekhar Das.        
	The switch in the illumination preferences follows a CESC circular explaining the benefits of using LEDs in puja pandals. LEDs have a longer burning life stretching up to 100,000 hours against 3,000 hours for incandescent lights.         
	The demand for power is maximum during Puja. LEDs lower the chances of overloading and faults as they consume less power, said a CESC official. The daily power consumption on the Puja days is about 1,500 MW.

           Picture this: Apropos If its icons, Buddha does care about his office wall, April 1, it is extremely demoralising that the chief minister is so concerned with trivial issues like what pictures he should hang in his office chamber when there are grave problems in the city and the state that require his immediate attention. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has spoken out in no uncertain terms against the poll panels directive about displaying pictures of public figures and resolved to protect what he considers his right. Why cant the chief minister show such resolve when it comes to banning polluting autorickshaws, busting the katatel racket, protecting the Maidan, removing hawkers, preventing bandhs and michhils and putting an end to the annual fiasco about holding the Book Fair?                                       
	It is doubtful whether we are at all serious about VVIP security in this city (Bullets, barriers for Buddha, March 21). This is not the first time that someone breached the chief ministers convoy. Every time police let off the offender lightly. The boy who barged into Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees cavalcade at the Park Street-Camac Street crossing was merely charged with negligent driving and released on bail after he pleaded ignorance of the rules.             
	Since when has ignorance of the law become a reason for an offender go scot-free? Can former Satyam chief B. Ramalinga Raju plead that he did not know fudging accounts was a crime?           
	Chameli Pal,
  Batanagar             
	It appears whenever Buddhababus convoys hits the road, either a youngster violates the traffic rules or a pilot car meets with a mishap (Buddha convoy in mishap, March 23). After a spate of breaches, the city police has put forward a proposal to shoot down any such traffic violator as it could be a potential threat to the honble chief minister.             
	I would like to suggest that all VIPs travel incognito, which would serve a dual purpose  they would get a feel of the Calcutta traffic and terrorists would not be aware of their movements. And in the process, the exchequer would save a huge amount of money, which is now spent on security arrangements.

	The report Risky passage for pedestrians, March 16, on city crossings vulnerable to accidents was well-timed. The Exide crossing is really a free-for-all zone, having no safety valve for pedestrians. One doesnt know how long to wait to cross the road. The green signal is erratic, much to the confusion of pedestrians. While it is indiscreet on the part of pedestrians to cross the road without waiting for the signal, it is also true that the mismanagement of the traffic system leads to many accidents on that stretch.             
	Since road space in Calcutta is extremely low, the traffic system should be streamlined in keeping with the increasing population density and ever-rising number of vehicles. Road accidents are alarmingly on the rise and its time a suitable traffic management plan is drawn up by experts and implemented in earnest.           
	P.B. Saha,
  Salt Lake                   
	It is heartening that the civic authorities are trying to enforce fire-prevention norms in shops and establishments (Fire code for small traders, March 16). But many such rules are framed from time to time, but are not enforced properly. The Nandaram market blaze has stirred the civic body to press for fire safety among traders. The authorities must make it mandatory for shops to have a fire-clearance certificate. Strict measures should be taken against unlicensed traders. Besides, the civic body must conduct inspections to check maintenance of fire-safety methods every three months.

	Singer Ramkumar Chattopadhyay was known for singing Nidhubabur tappa and Bengali puratani songs. He was equally famous as a kirtan and Shyamasangeet singer. In his death, Bengal lost one its doyens of tappa and puratani songs. (The City Diary, March 19).             
	B.N. Bose, 
  Dum Dum Park                   
	Apropos the report Complaints mark HS Day one (March 17), it is often seen that invigilators dont bother to answer students queries during board examinations. In some schools, the behaviour of teachers towards students of other schools in the exam hall is harsh and students fear to ask them for anything. This is why students fail to understand the instructions on question papers.             
	Atif Ayaz, 
  Serampore                   
	After reading the report Metro trains from 11am on Sundays, February 7, I went to Tollygunge Metro station at 11.30am on March 8 (a Sunday), but the shutters were down. I called up the Tollygunge station office and was told that the services would begin at the old timing for Sundays  2pm.             
	S.K. Rungta,
  Tollygunge           
	On March 30, Metro carried a report Hopes dashed for early Metro on Sundays, announcing the decision of Metro Railways to stick to the 2pm schedule for Sundays after trial runs with early timings on March 22 and 29 failed to register enough footfall.

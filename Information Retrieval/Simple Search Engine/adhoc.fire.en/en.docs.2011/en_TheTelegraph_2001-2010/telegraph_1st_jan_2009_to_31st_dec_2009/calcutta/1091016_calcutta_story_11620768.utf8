The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Puja fee cuffs on duo
                                                                                                               Puja fee cuffs on duo
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Police have showcaused the organisers of a Kali puja in Beleghata after two of them were arrested on the charge of forcibly collecting subscription from those driving down Beleghata Main Road.        
	Sital Sen and Rana Sen were arrested after we received complaints that they were forcibly collecting Kali puja subscription on behalf of Rani Rashmoni Boys Club in Beleghata. The club has been asked to cite reasons why the puja should not be stopped, said an officer.        
	The club claimed the arrested duo were not its members but the police said the subscription book they were carrying bore the clubs name.        
	This year, cops will be deployed at highrise buildings across the city as violations involving banned firecrackers have mostly been reported from tall buildings and housing complexes in the past few years. The police said they have met office-bearers of housing societies in Alipore, Shakespeare Sarani, Ballygunge and Beniapukur in south Calcutta and others in central Calcutta to acquaint them with the Diwali norms.         
	We will be on vigil from Saturday night till the early hours of Sunday. NCC and Civil Defence personnel would also be deployed, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner (headquarters). They will help the 10,000-strong police contingent that would patrol the streets on Diwali.         
	Fourteen watchtowers would be erected at strategic points, including Amherst Street, Bowbazar, Beadon Street and Lake Kali Bari, to keep an eye on crowd movement and check drunken brawls and eve-teasing.        
	We will keep 12 ambulances on stand-by and special patrol teams will criss-cross the city along with RAF and Special Action Force personnel, said an officer.

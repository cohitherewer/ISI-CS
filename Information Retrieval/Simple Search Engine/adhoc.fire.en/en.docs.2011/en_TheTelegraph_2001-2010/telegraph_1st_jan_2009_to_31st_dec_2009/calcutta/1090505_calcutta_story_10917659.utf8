          A STAFF REPORTER                                        The cycle from which Sourav and Sanjib fell. (Aranya Sen)       
	Two brothers going to school on their mothers bicycle fell off the carrier and were run over by a truck on Akshay Mukherjee Road, near Baranagar, on Monday morning.        
	Witnesses said Sourav, 9, was holding the seat of the bicycle while Sanjib, 7, was holding his brother as their mother Bimala Patra cycled them to Adarsha Primary School in Netaji Colony from their home in Indira Colony, Nawpara.        
	Souravs grip on the seat  loosened near the Nawpara  railway bridge and both boys  tumbled to the ground and  rolled under the rear wheels of  the truck which was moving  in the opposite direction.    Bimala lost her balance  and fell against the side of the  truck before being flung aside.  She suffered cuts.    The head and chest of  both boys were crushed. They  were lying in a pool of blood.  The cycle, too, was damaged,  said Rajesh Ganguli, who was  on his way to open his stationery  shop near the 34B bus  stand.    The boys were declared  dead at Baranagar State General  Hospital.    Hazarilal Patra, the boys  grandfather, said Bimala used  to cycle her sons to school,  2km from home, every day.  The boys father Ashok is a  truck driver.    I dont know how to console  them. We will take the  bodies to our native place in  Sandeshkhali for the last  rites, said Hazarilal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Victoria Memorial sits on edited Hyde papers
                                                                                                               Victoria Memorial sits on edited Hyde papers
          SOUMITRA DAS                                            
	A compact disc of an edited version of legal documents compiled by an 18th century judge of Calcutta was handed over to Victoria Memorial Hall about three years ago but the authorities are yet to publish it.        
	Historian Pradip Sinha, who has edited the papers compiled by John Hyde, had submitted the CD to Chittaranjan Panda, the secretary and curator of the Memorial, on August 5, 2006, and another to the governor, also the chairman of the institution, on June 26, 2007.         
	Sinha had been commissioned by the Memorial to edit the legal papers, known for their abstruse nature and written in antiquated shorthand that is undecipherable today. Sinha has suffered two strokes since and become disabled.        
	Panda said over the phone on Thursday morning that he would be only too glad to publish Sinhas work if only it were publishable. In its present form it is not, as historian Tapan Raychaudhuri, who had reviewed the work, had suggested that Sinha expand on the introduction and add a glossary, he added.        
	Raychaudhuri, who lives in the UK, told Metro over the phone on Thursday afternoon that the introduction was skimpy, but if it is a choice between publishing the papers in their present form and not publishing them I would say that they should be published.        
	He, however, added that a younger person should be assigned the task of elaborating on the introduction and the glossary. It should not take more than two months, Raychaudhuri said.         
	Historian Barun De, who is on the Memorials board of trustees, is disappointed at the failure of the Memorial to get the Hyde papers published. Editing that sort of recondite material is difficult. It is our responsibility to ensure its publication. Unfortunately, the issue has not come before the trustees, says De.         
	Raychaudhuri had in September 2007 described the Hyde papers as one of the most important sources of Indian history, especially of the first phase of the introduction of English law to India. This is a taster, but it is an important contribution by itself, he had commented.        
	The last time Sinha met Panda in the Memorial to discuss the budget for further work was on October 3, 2007. The budget was submitted within two days but Sinha is yet to hear from the authorities.        
	Sinhas work runs into 503 pages in seven chapters, such as Charges to the Grand Jury, Supreme Court Against Arbitrary Action, Case of Hindu Law and Succession in Muslim Law.        
	The Memorial has been in possession of the 73-volume papers since its former curator and secretary Nisith Ranjan Ray had brought the collection from the high court Bar Library. The Hyde papers give an idea of the introduction of English law to India and of Indo-Shastric law, which is Hindu law in the first stages of its evolution.         
	The record of the sessions trials, where judges distinguish between murder and manslaughter, are significant because of the application of English criminal law to the Indian situation.        
	Hyde was among the first group of judges to be appointed by the king in 1774. His papers document the nature of crime and punishment in Calcutta and the areas under the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. It presents a vivid picture of slavery in late 18th century Calcutta and in Bihar and other parts of Bengal as well. William Jones writes an animated account of the prevalence of slavery in Calcutta. Joness charges to the grand jury on criminal cases are an important part of Hyde papers.        
	De, however, said though Hyde papers were once considered a rare way of looking at the lives of ordinary people, Robert Traverss work on the Khalsa Records of 1773-1778 has a much greater depth of information on the lives of average people.

	A low-pressure area over the Bay of Bengal gave Calcutta a wet Wednesday, marked by several short spells of monsoon rain that kept the mercury down and held out hope for steady showers over the next 48 hours.        
	What the city experienced through the day cant be classified as heavy rain, but the current spell of monsoon activity is likely to persist for 48 hours, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.        
	More rain is being forecast despite the well-marked low-pressure area over the Bay moving away from Bengal and heading towards Orissa.        
	For the city, 21.1mm of rain through the day may not have been the highest this monsoon but the staggered showers kept the discomfort index from going beyond 58 degrees Celsius, three points above normal.        
	Cloud imagery from the satellite Kalpana-1 at 2.30pm on Wednesday showed convective clouds over north and central Bay of Bengal. Active monsoon conditions may continue in south Bengal with the likely formation of a low-pressure area over the northwest Bay, said an official.         
	The axis of the monsoon trough at mean sea level, as of Wednesday, was passing through Gujarat, Orissa and the centre of the low-pressure area in the east. The monsoon trough is a line on the weather map that shows the location of minimum sea level pressure and is a convergence zone between the wind patterns of the southern and northern hemispheres. Heavy rain marking the peak of monsoon generally takes place along that axis.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Move to rein in errant Kali puja pandals
                                                                                                               Move to rein in errant Kali puja pandals
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The pandal erected by the Naba Yubak Sangha off Keshub Chandra Sen Street that has not bothered to leave any space on either side; (below) the Amherst Street puja has barely left 2.5ft space at the rear end of the pandal. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                          
	Mere inspection for Durga puja, but proper action for Kali puja  thats what police are promising in a move to enforce the high court-ratified rules to make the festivities safe and sensible.        
	With a fortnight to go for the festival of lights, a team led by Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters), inspected five pandals in north Calcutta on Sunday in a bid to rein in errant pujas.        
	The guidelines could not be implemented for Durga puja because they arrived just three days before the festival began, but we will implement them for Kali puja. All 2,050 puja organisers have enough time to follow the rules, said a senior officer at Lalbazar.        
	Sundays scan caught at least two high-profile pujas on the wrong foot  the one organised by the Amherst Street Sadharan Sri Sri Kali Puja Committee, popularly known as Somen Mitras puja, and the one by Naba Yubak Sangha, popularly known as Fatakeshtos puja, off Keshub Chandra Sen Street.        
	The Amherst Street pandal has 4ft clearance on three sides but on one side the courts direction was not followed, said Shamim.        
	Sudipto Sarkar, a puja committee member, later said that following the police inspection the bamboo poles at the rear end of the pandal had been shifted. But when Metro inspected the pandal on Sunday evening, the contentious part was still barely 2.5ft away from the wall of a shop.        
	At the Naba Yubak Sangha puja, the entire 14ft wide lane has been gobbled up by the pandal, but cars can pass through for now as the platform for the deity is 8ft high.        
	The police told us to leave 4ft space from the houses on both sides of the road. We will try our best to do that, shrugged Dhananjay Dhar of the puja committee.         
	October 7 is the last date for Kali puja organisers to submit the form for police permission. We will meet all organisers on October 9 and they will have to assure us that the courts guidelines will be followed, Shamim said.

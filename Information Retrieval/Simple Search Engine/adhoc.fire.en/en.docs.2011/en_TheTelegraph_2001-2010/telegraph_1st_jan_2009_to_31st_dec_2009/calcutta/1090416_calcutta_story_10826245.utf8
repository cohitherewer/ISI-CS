The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Double check on colleges
                                                                                                               Double check on colleges
          MITA MUKHERJEE                                    
	Calcutta University has decided to be stricter with colleges that intend starting postgraduate courses, ending a five-year phase when undergraduate institutes would only have to ask for permission to upgrade.        
	We cannot  and will not  compromise on quality, vice-chancellor Suranjan Das said on Wednesday.        
	The reason for being choosy about granting academic and administrative autonomy to colleges for post-graduate studies is apparently competition from private universities. We need to make the rules stricter to ensure that the colleges that get permission to run postgraduate courses maintain our standards, Das said.        
	The stricter rules include asking colleges to state the research experience of their senior faculty in the subjects that would be taught. Colleges were earlier granted permission if they had a certain number of teachers in each subject at the postgraduate level.        
	The old rules also allowed colleges to start postgraduate courses if their libraries and laboratories were sufficiently equipped.        
	Colleges now not only need to have well-equipped libraries and laboratories, they must also be able to prove that the existing infrastructure can be upgraded.         
	The financial condition of a college will be taken into consideration because infrastructure cannot be upgraded without resources, said a senior official.        
	Nearly a dozen colleges affiliated to Calcutta University have so far been granted autonomy to run post-graduate courses. The list includes Presidency, Brabourne, Bethune, Scottish Church, Vidyasagar, Bangabasi, Ashutosh, Goenka, Dinabandhu Andrews and Bijaygarh.        
	Have these colleges been maintaining the requisite standards? Most of them are doing well. Over the past few months, we have received applications from several colleges interested in taking the postgraduate route. But with the education scenario being what it is, we thought stricter norms are required now, the vice-chancellor said.        
	Colleges applying for post-graduate permission meet the eligibility criteria now but officials think the present set of rules does not ensure quality over a long period.        
	We doubt whether these colleges will be able to continue running postgraduate courses properly after the initial interest in a new project wears off. So academic and social indicators are being added to the eligibility criteria, said an official.        
	The new guidelines will be posted on the universitys website shortly.

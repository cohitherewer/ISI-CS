The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Regular boys in the dock for rape
                                                                                                               Regular boys in the dock for rape
  - Classmates didnt see any abnormal streak          CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE AND MEGHDEEP BHATTACHARYYA                                  The three accused being produced in court                                        
	None of the three youths accused of raping a 21-year-old girl repeatedly after drugging her at a party on February 8 ever behaved in a manner that suggested they were capable of such a crime, according to friends.        
	If one of the boys was described as shy, another was supposedly reserved and the third was an out-and-out introvert. They had four things in common  a Siliguri connection, stable families, good financial backgrounds and ambition.        
	So, were they Jekyll and Hyde characters? Metro tries to find some answers through their classmates and teachers.                
	TANMOY MAYUKH BORAI        
	Tanmoy, 21, in whose apartment in Santoshpur the alleged rape occurred, was so shy in the company of girls that friends would tease him about it. He enjoyed hanging around the canteen like most students do but he actually hesitated to talk to girls, said a final-year B.Com student in Tanmoys college.        
	I cant reconcile the two faces, said another batchmate, about his friend who steered clear of girls on campus and yet allegedly invited one over to his apartment with rape on his mind.        
	Tanmoys goal for this year was to get into a good MBA institute, said friends.        
	His idea of fun was splurging on food. Money was never a problem for Tanmoy. He would visit his Siliguri home once or twice a month and throw a party for his friends after returning from each trip, a batchmate said.        
	Friends also recalled instances of Tanmoy going out of his way to help them whenever they needed it. If a devious mind was at work behind the friendly faade, he hid it well. Not for a moment did I find him twisted, one of them said.                
	RISHIN SENGUPTA        
	When Rishin, 22, joined a post-graduate diploma course in risk management early this month, the first thing a classmate noticed was that he had very good handwriting.        
	He didnt interact much with the rest of the nine students in his class but the general impression everyone got was that Rishin was decent and in control of himself. He would say hello, attend class and leave, said a classmate.        
	Rishins father is an engineer in Farakka and his mother is the principal of a private college in Murshidabad. He did his graduation from Siliguri Institute of Technology and met Tanmoy and Saptarshi during his stay there.        
	While his new classmates described him as reserved, Rishins neighbours in a VIP Road housing estate painted a different picture. He and his brother would throw noisy parties that kept us awake all night, a woman in the flat next to theirs said.              
	SAPTARSHI SANYAL        
	This third-year English honours student is supposedly the quietest of the three. We have hardly spoken. He has always been an introvert, said a classmate. Another student said he knew the 21-year-old as a quiet boy from a well-to-do family in Siliguri.        
	A teacher in the English department of the college said Saptarshi was a good student who kept a low profile. But he was irregular in college of late. I dont know why he attended fewer classes in the third year, the teacher said.        
	Did he ever display uncharacteristic behaviour? Not that I know of. We could never have imagined he would be arrested for such a crime, another teacher said.

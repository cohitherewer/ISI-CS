The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cop watch clears up car windows
                                                                            Tuesday , November 17 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Cop watch clears up car windows
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Many car owners across the city queued up in front of accessories shops on Monday to get dark films on their vehicle windows removed to avoid police crackdown.        
	The sergeants have now found another reason to fine vehicle owners. It makes better sense to replace the films than pay the fine, said a bank executive, standing beside his WagonR outside a car dcor shop in Bhowanipore.        
	The crackdown on cars with windows covered with dark films started on Saturday, with around 230 owners and drivers being slapped with a fine of Rs 100 each. Films with lighter tints, allowing 50 per cent visibility through the windows and 70 per cent through rear windscreen, are allowed.        
	The move has run into protests by celebrities who claim that dark films save them from being mobbed.        
	On Monday, the traffic police wing fined around 190 owners and drivers across the city. Most offenders did not protest but some on the Bypass claimed that they were not aware of the rules and pleaded that they be given a chance to get the coating removed or replaced.        
	The crackdown started a day before the government published advertisements in newspapers specifying the rules. This is unfair, said Asit Baran Roy, a resident of Nimtala in north Calcutta. He had turned up with his Tata Sumo at a Bentinck Street shop to get the dark films on the glasses removed.        
	The police, however, pointed out that the central motor vehicles rules had long ago laid down the specifications on dark tints on car windows.        
	Ranvir Kumar, the joint commissioner of police (traffic), said: There is no question of allowing any relaxation. Across all traffic guards, officers have been asked to track down vehicles with dark tinted glasses. Offenders will be fined.        
	A section of car owners and drivers may be fuming at the police but owners of vehicle accessory shops are happy. We are getting good business. A coating for all the windows and the rear glass, with a three-year guarantee, is priced Rs 1,550. An inferior quality is selling at Rs 950, said the owner of a central Calcutta shop. The sample cards clearly spell out the amount of light that can pass through the film and the level of UV protection. So there is no way one can plead ignorance.  
	to tint or not to tint, that is the celeb question Paoli Dam, actress 
  I don rsquo;t plan to change my car glasses, they are slightly tinted. I think it rsquo;s necessary for celebrities to have tinted glasses. If that is not allowed, cops have to give them extra protection. Is that possible? But if a law is passed against tinted glasses, I will abide by it.  Jisshu Sengupta, actor 
  My car glasses have only 50 per tint. Not just celebrities, I think people who are recognised by the masses should be allowed to use tinted glasses. Otherwise, I would request the authorities to make arrangements for their security.
    Agnimitra Paul, designer 
  I am not a celebrity and I don rsquo;t fear being mobbed, but for privacy 
  reasons I do prefer tinted glasses. If a law is passed against it, I will not protest.   Tota Roy Chowdhury, actor 
  If I am asked to remove the dark tint to help reduce the crime rate, I will 
  support it whole-heartedly. But if it is a knee-jerk reaction, a tokenism, then 
  as a tax-paying citizen I will be very disappointed.  June, actress 
  It rsquo;s difficult to drive around with clear glasses. It rsquo;s especially intimidating for women because men pass silly remarks and often make fun of women drivers. Besides, I feel more secure driving home late at night with tinted glasses.  Bickram Ghosh, percussionist 
  I use slightly tinted glasses and I think I will stick to it because of privacy reasons. Otherwise, people might just knock on the window and do all sorts of things. Besides, I work on my laptop while travelling and I feel comfortable with those tinted glasses.

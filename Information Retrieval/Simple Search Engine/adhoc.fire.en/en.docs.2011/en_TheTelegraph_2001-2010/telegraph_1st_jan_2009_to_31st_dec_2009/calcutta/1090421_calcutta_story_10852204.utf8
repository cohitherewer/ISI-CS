	First-year students of Jogamaya Devi College gheraoed the principal and some teachers for nine hours on Monday for permission to sit for the Part I exams despite not having the required attendance and failing in the selection tests. Police rescued the teachers in the evening.        
	Ninety-five students have been debarred from sitting for the tests. The City College authorities on Sunday were forced to allow 295 students with inadequate attendance to sit for Part I after being gheraoed for over 24 hours. Calcutta University stressed the attendance rules would not be relaxed.

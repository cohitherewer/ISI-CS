                                                                            Wednesday , November 4 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Drizzle not to impact mercury
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The city experienced a brief drizzle on Tuesday afternoon but the weather office ruled out any chance of heavy showers that could drag the mercury down and hasten the onset of winter.        
	A thundercloud cell, formed under the influence of a low-pressure trough over the Bay of Bengal, resulted in the drizzle. Till 5.30pm, the city received 11mm of rain.        
	The impact of the drizzle, caused by a low-pressure trough over the Bay, will be short-lived, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	The drizzle is unlikely to continue for more than an hour, Debnath told Metro at 4.45pm, barely 15 minutes after it began. The precipitation stopped around 5.15pm.        
	Met officials said the weather in the city would continue to be pleasant over the next few days though there is no chance of lower than usual temperatures on Tuesday night or Wednesday morning.        
	There wasnt enough rain to drag the mercury down. There wont be any change in the prevalent weather conditions, said the weatherman.        
	Wednesday, however, could see a partly cloudy sky, a break from the past few days clear skies over Calcutta and its surrounding areas.        
	Also, possibilities of rain or thundershowers in some areas cannot be ruled out, said the weatherman.        
	Temperatures on Wednesday are likely to range between 23 and 32 degrees Celsius.

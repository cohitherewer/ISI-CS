The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | First hill trek was pure bliss
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                          First hill trek was pure bliss
          ADITI RAY                          Aritree during the trek                        
	For nine-year-old Aritree Paul, this was a Durga puja vacation like no other. Never having been to the mountains before, she was apprehensive about the trek to Bali Pass (4800m) in the Garhwal Himalayas that her father had planned with his friends.         
	The trip included many firsts for the Class III student of Binodini Girls High School, Dhakuria. I have never gone camping before. In the course of the trek, I saw snow and slept in a sleeping bag inside a tent, she smiled. Aritree travelled with her family and seven others for the 15-day trip that started from Hardwar and ended at Sankri in Uttaranchal.         
	The group began the trek from Yamunotri. Along the way, the group had to walk through snow fields for several kilometres. The sight of snow stretching away in all directions was breathtaking, as were the massive mountain peaks, Bunderpuchh and Kalanag at Bali Pass, she recalled.        
	Walking downhill was faster, but I had to carefully find my way. Losing my footing would mean a bad fall, she said. The walk down took Aritree past the picturesque Ruinsara Tal. She feels the 13-km walk from Ruinsara to Taluka was the toughest. At 2 degrees Celsius, it was quite cold. The rocks were wet from the melted snow. My shoes also posed a problem, as they were not meant for rocky terrain, she said. Slipping and sliding, she continued, often holding on to rocks to maintain balance. The sight of the beautiful Ruinsara lake was worth the trouble, she said.         
	For her father Ashok Pal, trekking with his daughter had been a long-held dream. She walked with us through six km of snow without a hitch. I plan to take her to Borasu Pass in Himachal Pradesh next, he smiled.        
	Though I was really scared at first, the experience has been great fun, said Aritree. I cant wait to return to the mountains again, she added.

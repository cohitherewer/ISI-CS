The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Teachers protest pay hike delay 
                                                                                                               Teachers protest pay hike delay 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Teachers in private English-medium schools across the city are organising demonstrations to protest the delay in salary hike even after tuition fees were increased to implement the recommendations of the Fifth Pay Commission.         
	The pay commissions recommendations came into effect on April 1. But till date our management has not assured us of increasing our pay scales, said a teacher of Vidya Bharati School while taking part in a sit-in on the issue in front of the institution on Tuesday evening.        
	The functioning of the English-medium school in Behala had been affected since Monday after the teachers launched a movement against the authorities. The teachers of the Mominpur branch of the school also organised an agitation on Wednesday.         
	Jewish Girls School, Elias Meyer School, South Point School and Sunrise School have also seen teachers movement in the recent past against the delay in pay hike.         
	After teaching 28 years, I get a salary of around Rs 17,000 per month. My salary will increase to Rs 26,000 once the authorities implement the recommendations of the Fifth Pay Commission. There is no reason for the school not to pay the revised salaries when they have already increased the tuition and other fees, said a teacher of Elias Meyer School who is part of the ongoing work-to-rule movement in the institution.        
	Authorities of most schools said on the condition of anonymity that the fee hike was not enough to revise salaries according to the pay commissions recommendations, at least from April.        
	Teachers said this was an excuse by the school managements for not implementing the award or delay the process to earn interest on the additional income from fees.        
	We will pay teachers according to the revised scale from September, said a source at South Point School, where the fees went up in April.        
	Our management implemented the recommendations of the pay commission partially, after we organised a three-day agitation. We will resume our protest if the authorities take too long to fully implement the pay scale, said Biswanath Banerjee, a teacher of Sunrise School in Howrah.        
	Shyamali Basu Ray, the teacher in-charge of Vidya Bharati, said she had no idea about the teachers demand and refused comment.         
	Government officials said they were worried about the unwillingness of private schools to hike teachers salaries even after increasing tuition fees. We can only express anger at the errant schools but we need a law to take action against them, said a senior official.        
	We are aware about the grievances of teachers of some private English-medium schools. The government is trying to find a solution to the problem, said Dibyen Mukherjee, the director of school education.

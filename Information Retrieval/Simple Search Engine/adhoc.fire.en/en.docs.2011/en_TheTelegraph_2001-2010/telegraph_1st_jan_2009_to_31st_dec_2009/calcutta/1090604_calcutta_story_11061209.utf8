The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A great brother
                                                                                                               A great brother
                            
	On his way to Heathrow hoping to arrive in Calcutta in time for Jit Pauls funeral set for 5pm on Thursday, an emotional Lord Swraj Paul told The Telegraph: Right till the end my elder brother did not lose the will to live.        
	After spending the last few weeks in Calcutta by his ailing brother, Swraj had returned to London on Sunday night.        
	Swraj said he and Jit, who was eight years his senior, were very close. When Swraj learnt his brother was not well, he dropped everything in London, including his many duties in the House of Lords, and rushed to Calcutta that same evening.        
	Jit had not immediately let on that he had been diagnosed with cancer in his telephone conversation with Swraj. All he said on March 26 was: Come to Calcutta just once more to see me.        
	Swraj said: He sounded a little low.        
	During a six-week stay in Calcutta, Swraj nursed his brother every day. He said Jit told him, Now that you have come I want to live. Not on one day did he lose the will to live. He said, Im going to fight this.        
	 Swraj paused and said: He was a great brother. We had a very special bond.

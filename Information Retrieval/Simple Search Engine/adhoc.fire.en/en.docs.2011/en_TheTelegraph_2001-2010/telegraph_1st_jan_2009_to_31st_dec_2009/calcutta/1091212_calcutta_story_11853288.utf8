The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Return of fog delays 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Return of fog delays

	Several flights were delayed in Calcutta because of fog at the destination airports on Friday. Air Indias flights to Delhi and Guwahati were delayed by 30 minutes while a JetLite flight to Patna and Kingfisher flights to Bhubaneswar and Guwahati were held up for around an hour.         
	Airlines are bracing for more such delays with the onset of winter. The Category II Instrument Landing System, installed at the city airport in 2007, allows flights to operate when visibility is 350 metres or more. But visibility often dips to below 50m in Calcutta.         
	An official of Air India, which has the maximum number of CAT III-qualified pilots, said: We will have stand-by aircraft at Calcutta, including the Airbus 319. He added that a dedicated call centre service would provide information on fog to passengers.        
	Kingfisher said its CAT II-trained pilots would be rotated and extra aircraft pressed into service to avoid chain delays.         
	Jet Airways officials said information about fog-related delays would be sent to fliers via text messages and requested passengers to provide personal numbers while booking tickets.        
	The Met office has ruled out dense fog in the next 24 hours in Calcutta. But there can be some mist towards the morning, said the weatherman.         
	Moisture from the Bay of Bengal is causing mist and fog in and around Calcutta and also preventing the temperature from dropping below normal, explained an official at the India Meteorological Department in Delhi.        
	On Friday, the minimum temperature stayed normal at 15.1 degrees Celsius. The humidity was high  between 48 per cent and 95 per cent  causing the discomfort index to touch 59 degrees Celsius, four notches above normal.        
	With the unforeseen formation of cyclonic storm Ward over southwest Bay of Bengal, which is expected to hit Tamil Nadu in the next 48 hours, temperatures in Calcutta arent expected to slide further for at least a couple of days.         
	There wont be any direct or major impact of Ward on the weather in and around the city, temperatures wont slip any further for the next couple of days, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.

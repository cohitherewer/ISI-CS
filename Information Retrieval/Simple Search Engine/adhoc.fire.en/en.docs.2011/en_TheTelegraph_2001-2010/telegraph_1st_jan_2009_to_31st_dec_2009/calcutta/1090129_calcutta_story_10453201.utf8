          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	T.R. Laljibhai and T.S. Harbhamji, who claimed to be Ahmedabad-based businessmen, were detained at the city airport on Wednesday after Rs 1 crore was found in one of their bags.        
	The two arrived on an Indigo flight from Ahmedabad. They were intercepted by income tax officials and interrogated.        
	We had a tip-off about the duo and were waiting for them at the airport, said an income tax official. They claimed that they had been carrying the money to the city for business purposes. We are yet to verify their statement. We will speak to their clients, said a police officer.

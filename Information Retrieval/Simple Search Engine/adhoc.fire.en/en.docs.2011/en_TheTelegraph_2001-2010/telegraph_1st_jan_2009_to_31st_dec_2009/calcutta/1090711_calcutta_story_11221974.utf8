The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Auto union plea not heard
                                                                                                               Auto union plea not heard
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Friday refused to hear an appeal by the Citu-affiliated autorickshaw operators union, seeking extension of the deadline to replace two-stroke autos with LPG ones from July 31 to December 31.         
	We will not hear the petition now. Whatever you have to say, you say on August 21, when the case related to the phase-out of old vehicles will come up for hearing, said the division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice B. Somadder.        
	The ban on two-stroke autos comes into effect from August 1.        
	Kishore Ghosh, the petitioner, is a leader of the Citu-led union. He claimed in the petition that the owners of 19,605 two-stroke autos had applied for replacing their vehicles with LPG three-wheelers.         
	Of these applications, 9,705 were valid and 2,390 three-wheelers have been replaced. In six months, the 20,044 two-stroke autos would be replaced with LPG ones and the order of the high court implemented, stated the petition.        
	Environment activist Subhash Dutta pointed out that the number of two-stroke autorickshaws plying in the city was well over 20,044 and many of them did not have permits.        
	The petitioner also claimed the newly replaced autos were facing problems procuring LPG.

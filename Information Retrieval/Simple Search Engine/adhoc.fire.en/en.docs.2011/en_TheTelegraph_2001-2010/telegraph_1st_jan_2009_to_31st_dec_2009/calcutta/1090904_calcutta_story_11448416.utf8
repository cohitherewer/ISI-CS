The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cops foxed by Vedic chameleon
                                                                                                               Cops foxed by Vedic chameleon
          SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE                              
	Investigators probing the antecedents of Vedic Village are lost in a maze of files detailing how it went from being a farmhouse project to a luxury resort-cum-villa complex that received no-questions-asked official clearance at every step.        
	Promoter Raj K. Modi and his original 21 partners in Vedic Village Developers Ltd had first approached the Chandpur panchayat in Rajarhat in 2001 to build 170 farmhouses spread across 278 bighas.         
	A senior police officer told Metro citing official records that the project got the then BJP-ruled panchayats permission within days of the application being filed on October 8, 2001.         
	The application only mentioned the holding number of the plot (JL-48) and the purpose of acquiring the land. It cleared the first official hurdle easily, he said.        
	Four years later  on December 27, 2005  the additional district magistrate of land reforms received a letter from one of the constituents of the holding company for conversion of JL-48, which included farmland, into commercial and residential plots.        
	The application (LR/M amp;C/C-49/2005) from Sanjeevani Projects Pvt Ltd (the original avatar of Modis Vedic Realty Ltd) to the land and land reforms department also mentioned plans to set up a tourist resort, the officer revealed.        
	He said Modis application was fast-tracked through a normally lengthy official process that includes stringent verification of information.         
	The managing director of Vedic Realty apparently did not face any problem in getting permission for further expansion even after the CPM wrested the reins of the panchayat.         
	In 2008-09, the CPM panchayat pradhan Nuruddin Gazi issued a fresh trade licence to Vedic Resorts and Hotels Pvt Ltd along with one to run a bar (Memo No. Chad/106/TC/Chandpur-2008-09) despite the application mentioning assistant project manager Biplab Biswas as the proprietor, the officer said.        
	When the trade licence came up for renewal earlier this year, the name of the applicant had changed to Circle Club and Resorts Pvt Ltd.        
	The changes in the nomenclature of the company behind the project and the way permission was granted for expansion and addition of commercial facilities to what was essentially meant to be a residential complex of farmhouses smacks of an unholy nexus, said an investigator.        
	Vedic Village is already under the scanner for forcible acquisition of farmland with the help of fugitive land shark Gaffar Mollah and stockpiling weapons on the premises of the luxury resort.        
	A senior official said the investigation was now focusing on the changing nature of the project. We are specifically looking at the nature of the tie-ups among the business partners behind Vedic Village, he added.        
	Jahanara Khatun, the president of the Rajarhat panchayat samity, said documents submitted to Chandpur panchayat office by Modi and his associates were not enough to support the extent to which the original project had been altered.

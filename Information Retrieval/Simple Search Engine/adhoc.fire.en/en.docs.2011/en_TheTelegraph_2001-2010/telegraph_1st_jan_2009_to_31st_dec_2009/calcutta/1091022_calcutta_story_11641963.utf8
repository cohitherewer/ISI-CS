                                                                                                               Varsity nod to PhD reforms
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jadavpur University on Wednesday decided to introduce admission tests and classes at the doctoral level following the new University Grants Commission (UGC) guidelines.         
	The executive council, the highest policy making body of the university, met on Wednesday to draft the changes in the PhD rules. Copies of the draft have been distributed to the members of the executive council. The reforms in the PhD rules will be finalised after going through the members observations, said Sidhhartha Dutta, the pro vice-chancellor of the university.        
	The revised regulations will be sent to the UGC for approval once they are accepted by the universitys executive council, he added. The council members are likely to approve the changes when they meet next on October 30.         
	The broad changes have already been agreed upon. As recommended by the UGC, those who do not clear the NET, SLET or the graduate aptitude test in engineering will have to sit for entrance tests for admission to MPhil and PhD programmes. The test will be followed by an interview on the applicants area of research.        
	The university will set up a research committee that will monitor a doctoral students work for a year. The committee will submit a report on the basis of which the authorities would decide whether the student could be registered for the PhD programme.        
	Doctoral students will have to attend classes before focussing on their thesis, said Parthapratim Biswas, a member of the council. The university is also set to make it mandatory for students to hand over a pre-submission report to the research committee before turning in the thesis.        
	Calcutta University adopted the new PhD norms recently.

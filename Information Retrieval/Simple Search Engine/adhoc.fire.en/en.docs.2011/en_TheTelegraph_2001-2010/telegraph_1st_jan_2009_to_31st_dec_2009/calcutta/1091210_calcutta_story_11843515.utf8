The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Corporal punishment ban in slow motion
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Corporal punishment ban in slow motion
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Five years is too little a time for the government to carry out a high court order and write to all schools in the state to stop corporal punishment.        
	That was apparent from an affidavit submitted to the court by the director of school education, Debyen Mukherjee, on Wednesday stating that secondary/higher secondary schools in only eight of the 19 districts in the state have received the notification.        
	As for primary schools, the authorities of as many as nine districts have failed to issue the notification.        
	The affidavit states that the school education department had sent the 2004 court order to the school inspectors of all 19 districts and asked them to convey it to the institutions under their jurisdiction.        
	The department has informed the court that the errant inspectors would be showcaused. They will have to clarify why they have failed to send compliance reports, the affidavit states.        
	The February 2004 court order had also stated that if corporal punishment led to a students death, the guilty teacher would be tried under IPC Section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) instead of Section 304A (death due to negligence).        
	An offence under Section 304 is punishable with life-term in jail, while Section 304A carries a lighter sentence of up to two years in jail.        
	The affidavit is scheduled to be taken up by the division bench headed by acting Chief Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya on Friday.        
	The 2004 order was passed by the division bench of the then chief justice, A.K. Mathur, after lawyer Tapas Bhanja produced copies of The Telegraph to suggest that corporal punishment in schools was on the rise.        
	I recently visited some schools in neighbouring districts and found the authorities unaware of the 2004 court order. So I decided to raise the issue again, said Bhanja.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Norms to fight air pollution
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Norms to fight air pollution
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The state environment department has issued a set of guidelines for construction activities to combat air pollution. The rules, to be effective from January 1, 2010, will apply to all builders, contractors and infrastructure developers, in private and public sectors. Those violating the norms will be penalised.         
	A senior environment department official said a survey conducted by the state pollution control board with the help of the Asian Development Bank revealed that construction activities were a major source of air pollution in Calcutta and its surroundings.         
	The study also mentioned that burning of tyres in hot mix plant as fuel during construction and melting coal tar for road repairs released noxious fumes.         
	Some of the measures are:         
	Wrap construction areas and buildings with geotextile fabric        
	Install dust barriers         
	Apply water before levelling or earth-moving activity to keep the soil moist         
	Apply dust suppressants on haul routes         
	Maintain dust control during working hours         
	Clean paved surfaces at the end of the work day or shift        
	During construction, including cutting of marble slabs, the noise should not exceed 65 decibels.        
	The official said local bodies, including municipalities and panchayats, and police would have to play a key role in ensuring that the guidelines were followed strictly.

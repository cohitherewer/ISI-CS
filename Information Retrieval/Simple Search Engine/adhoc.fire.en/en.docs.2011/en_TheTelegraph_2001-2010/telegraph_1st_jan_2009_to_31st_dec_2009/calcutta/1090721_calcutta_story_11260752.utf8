                                                                                                               Here come cloud amp; chaos 
  Bus, taxi firm on strike schedule        OUR BUREAU              Rally for rain               The overcast sky over Esplanade on Monday afternoon. The weather office warned of heavy to very heavy rainfall in the city and its adjoining areas over the next 48 hours. A low-pressure area over the northwest Bay that has developed into a depression will bring the rain, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre, in Alipore. At 11.30am on Monday, the system was centred around 120km southeast of Digha. It is likely to intensify and cross the coast between Balasore and Digha on Monday evening or night.

	Transporters on Monday stuck to their decision to go on an indefinite strike from Friday, ignoring the governments appeal to their good sense.        
	The operators have called the strike demanding that the government appeal to the court for an extension of the July 31 deadline on the phase-out of vehicles more than 15 years old.        
	Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty issued a press statement on Monday urging the law abiding operators to let good sense prevail and abstain from bringing about a chaotic situation on the road.        
	The government is left with no alternative but to enforce the order of the honourable high court... The government hopes the transport operators will abandon their call for an indefinite strike, the minister said.        
	The Banijyik Paribahan Bachao Committee, an umbrella body of transport operators in the state, met in the afternoon and rejected the ministers plea.        
	We will write to the transport department soon, asking it to spell out its stand on deferring the implementation of the totalitarian ban, said Swarnakamal Saha, the president of the Bengal Bus Syndicate. If the government does not act, we will go ahead with our strike plan.        
	Car attacked: Around 100 members of the Taxi Bachao Committee blocked the Exide crossing for around 20 minutes on Monday evening and smashed the windscreen of a Tata Sumo that was being used as a shuttle car.        
	These illegal shuttle vehicles are eating into our income. The cops take no action against them, said Bimal Guha, the general secretary of the Bengal Taxi Association and a member of the Taxi Bachao Committee.        
	Also during the day, environment activist Subhash Dutta said he would move a petition before the green bench of the high court requesting it to call an early hearing of the case relating to the phase-out of 15-year-old commercial vehicles.        
	I will request the court to intervene in the matter as the strike will unleash chaos on the streets, Dutta said. The case is scheduled to come up for hearing on August 21.

	SHOUT OUT LOUD - Terror has no colour        
	After 9/11 and more recently, after the Mumbai attacks, people who know I am a Muslim often tell me that they feel all Muslims are not terrorists. I am glad they feel that way.         
	However I do not need to be reassured about it repeatedly. For, a person committing a heinous crime like shooting innocent people definitely cannot be a true Muslim.         
	The Quran, states: Whoever kills a person [unjustly]it is as though he has killed all mankind. And whoever saves a life, it is as though he had saved all mankind.         
	Terrorists do not have a religion. They use it as a mantle to do what their religion forbids. At its heart is the desire to meet their own narrow agenda. A person who burns churches, mosques or temples with the purpose of safeguarding religious beliefs is not worthy of belonging to any religion. Lets not communalise terror. It has no green or saffron shade to it.

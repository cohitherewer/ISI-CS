                      Designed to perfection                    One of the greatest icons and influential figures of Indias theatre movement, Khaled Choudhury is best known for his brilliant stage designs. His diverse tastes in drawing, painting as well as folk and Western music were reflected in his designs for more than a hundred well-known stage productions, notably Bohurupees Raktakarabi (1954). However, he began his career as a designer and illustrator for books, a profession in which he excelled with over 15,000 books in different languages to his credit. Unfortunately, much of his work has been lost or destroyed. But some of them have been painstakingly collected and restored by researcher Pradip Dutta. To mark Choudhurys stepping into his nineties this year, Narayan Sanyal Anuragi Samity and Aabheri host an exhibition of works by the versatile genius, beginning today at 6 pm. Featuring rare book covers, illustrations, sketches, portraits and photographs, it pays a fitting tribute to his multi-faceted talents. A documentary on Khaled Choudhury will also be screened everyday.                    Event: An exhibition of art works, cover designs, sketches and photographs by Khaled Choudhury When: September 14 - 17; 2 pm - 8 pm Where: Gaganendra Shilpa Pradarshashala

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rain change alert
                                                                                                               Rain change alert
                              The city has received less than normal rain this monsoon. Bishwarup Dutta                            
	Is climate change happening too rapidly in Calcutta and surrounding areas? The question hangs heavy over the city after a not-so-cold winter, an unusually hot summer and now the prospect of an almost rainless monsoon. Though the trend is similar throughout the country, except in areas like Mumbai which is recording high rainfall, the lack of rain is most striking in south Bengal. Things came to such a pass that chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee recently convened an all-party meet to discuss the impending threat to agriculture in the state because of poor rainfall.        
	The situation is worse in south Bengal districts in comparison with north Bengal. According to our data till July-end the rainfall is 37 per cent less than normal in south Bengal, including Calcutta. The situation is marginally better in north Bengal with 26 per cent less rain than normal, said G.C. Debnath, the regional director of Indian Meteorological Department in Alipore.        
	The situation is unusual as almost half the monsoon period is already over (normally June to September is considered the monsoon months), the weatherman said. Even last year the situation was better, he said.        
	According to meteorological department sources, while the rainfall in South 24-Parganas and Howrah is almost a quarter less than normal, the situation is far worse in Hooghly with above 50 per cent less rainfall till July end.         
	What is intriguing is that districts such as Purulia and Bankura, generally known for less rain, have so far received better rainfall than districts known for high rainfall, added Debnath.         
	Climate scientists feel that the changing trend is consistent with the predictions of the Intergovernmental panel for climate change (IPCC).         
	It is predicted that with time, there will be more vagaries in climatic conditions. What we have seen in Calcutta this year is only a trailer, said Jayshree Roy, a climate expert of Jadavpur University.         
	Roy explained that IPCC had predicted large-scale climatic variation by 2050 and the closer we move towards the deadline, the more we face climatic chaos.        
	New York has devised a full-fledged combat plan  and invested billions of dollars  to counter climate change since 2007 and the city expects to reap harvest from 2030.         
	Cant Calcutta  much more vulnerable as is evident from the climatic extremities this year  do something?                     JAYANTA BASU

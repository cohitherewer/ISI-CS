                      Towards a free and equal society                    As part of its continuing endeavour to facilitate the establishment of a violence-free society with complete gender equality, Swayam organises year-round initiatives to mobilise public opinion against all forms of violence against women and to draw more people into the struggle for womens rights. During its ongoing International Campaign to Stop Violence against Women and Girls it has tried to use the potential of the student community and channelise it correctly in order to fulfil its vision of a society where women and men enjoy equal rights and privileges. To this end, they are hosting a programme for the youth of Calcutta, Winds of Change... Towards Equality. This programme is the culmination of a process participated by students of four well-known colleges of the city, who underwent a three-day training on gender issues with Swayam. The students were encouraged to express their opinion on gender equality through creative mediums of dance, theatre and photography, all in collaboration with a professional in each field. A series of seven posters on gender equality and its impact on society were also developed as part of this process. This evenings programme showcases these outstanding student endeavours and will be followed by a music performance by Bangla band Chandrabindoo. Anchor: Shakil Ansari.

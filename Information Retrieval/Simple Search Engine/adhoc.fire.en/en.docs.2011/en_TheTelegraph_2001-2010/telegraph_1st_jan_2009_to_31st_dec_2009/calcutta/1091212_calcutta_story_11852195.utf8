The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Apex consumer cell in city
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Apex consumer cell in city
          SANJAY MANDAL                              
	Piyush Pal, the managing director of a clinic in Calcutta, is fighting a case of medical negligence at the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission since 2006.        
	In the past four years, I had to travel to Delhi at least 15 times for the case since the opponent kept missing hearing dates, said Pal.         
	Hundreds of aggrieved consumers from the city and the state are forced to travel to Delhi to fight cases at the national commission, which often stretch for years.        
	There is, however, some respite for such consumers  the national commission will organise its circuit bench sittings in Calcutta for nearly a month to hear pending cases from Bengal. The bench will function from January 11 to February 5 at the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commissions office in Bhabani Bhavan.        
	This is the first time since it was set up 19 years ago that the apex consumer redress body will hear cases in Calcutta. Sources in the national commission said 135 original appeals and revision petitions from the state commission were pending with the body.         
	The registry of the national commission will accept fresh complaints, too, said D.P. Jana, the registrar and nodal officer of the state commission. Now people wont have to rush to Delhi, he added.        
	The expenses to fight a case increases sharply if the petitioner has to travel to Delhi for it. Many complainants cannot bear such expenses and so they do not approach the national commission, said Tarun Chakraborty, the joint secretary of the Consumers Unity and Guidance Forum.         
	The Calcutta bench will be of great help for consumers who want to approach the national body, Chakraborty pointed out.        
	According to sources, the national commission had also planned to hear cases from other states of eastern India in Calcutta.        
	However, the huge number of pending cases from Bengal led the national commission to set up a circuit bench in Calcutta exclusively for the state, a source said from Delhi.        
	In January, the circuit bench will be presided over by R.C. Jain and Anupam Dasgupta will be the other member. In February, national commission president Ashok Bhan will preside over the bench and B.K. Taimini will be the other member.         
	A source said if cases piled up in future, a similar bench could be formed in Calcutta again.        
	Around 700 cases are pending with the state consumer commission.         
	The number of pending cases has, however, gone down sharply compared with last year, a state commission official pointed out.         
	Last year, there were around 3,000 cases pending during the year-end.         
	Speedy disposals of cases has helped bring down the number of pending cases, he added.

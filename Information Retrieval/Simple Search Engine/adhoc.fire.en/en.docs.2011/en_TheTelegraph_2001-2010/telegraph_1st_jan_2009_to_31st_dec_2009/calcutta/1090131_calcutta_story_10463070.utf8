The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Citu suit by hotel
                                                                                                               Citu suit by hotel
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          Posters outside the hotel. A Telegraph picture                                  
	The management of Hotel Hindusthan International (HHI) has filed a contempt petition in Calcutta High Court against Citu, alleging that the unions illegal agitation outside the hotel had led to cancellation of bookings and huge monetary losses.         
	The British Council had booked 40 rooms in the hotel on January 9 this year for putting up delegates from the UK, Italy, Germany and France. The delegates were to arrive in the city from Thursday to take part in an educational programme.         
	On January 25, the British Council authorities cancelled the booking as a section of employees had been staging demonstration in front of the hotel by putting up festoons, banners and posters on the fencing, said Ananta Shaw, the lawyer representing the HHI.        
	Several companies had booked the banquets of the hotel between January 23 to January 27 for holding seminars and other programmes. The companies cancelled their bookings because of the agitation. The hotel had suffered a loss of Rs 13.09 lakh because of the cancellations, added Shaw.         
	The tussle between Hotel Hindusthan Karmachari Union, which is affiliated to Citu, and the management is long-standing. Citu supporters claim that the management is not recognising the union because of a nexus with the employees union affiliated to the Congress-backed Intuc.        
	The company is not holding union polls for years. Our demand for a revision of pay-scale has not been met by the management, said Mohammed Nizamuddin, the president of the Citu-backed union.        
	On January 15, the management had moved a writ before the high court stating that the Citu-affiliated union, through its demonstrations near the entrance, was disrupting the normal functioning of the hotel.         
	Justice Sanjeev Banerjee had passed an order restraining Citu from holding agitations within 50 metres of the premises.        
	But the Citu union is not following the order and the police are not taking steps against the protesters despite repeated appeals by us, said a member of the hotel management.        
	Fridays petition will come up for hearing on February 3.

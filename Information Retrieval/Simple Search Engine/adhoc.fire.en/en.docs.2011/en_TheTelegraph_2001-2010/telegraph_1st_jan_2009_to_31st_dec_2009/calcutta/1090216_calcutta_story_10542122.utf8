                      Art and the man                    Last October, Aakriti Art Gallery hosted Gen Next III, an exhibition of works by talented, young artists. Deviating from its earlier editions, it was an event that, besides showcasing fresh talent, also provided aesthetically stimulating events including a two-day art camp and a symposium on recent issues related to contemporary art. As it was of very short duration, the former saw participants engaged vigorously at their task, trying their best to complete their works within the stipulated time. A buzz of physical and intellectual activity, it was participated by Gen Next artists (Mathew Tom, Korou KH, Serena Scappagnini, Amit Kalla, Prandeep Kalita, Sutanuka Giri, Nantu Behari Das, Saptarshi Naskar, Anirban Das Mahapatra and Ashraful Hasan, amongst others) as well as veterans Aditya Basak, Amitava Dhar, Akhilesh, Chandra Bhattacharya, Chhatrapati Dutta, Manish Pushkale, Partha Pratim Deb, Samindranath Majumdar, Sekhar Ray (a painting by him appears here), Sunil De, Tapas Konar, Birendra Pani and Yogender Tripath. The ongoing exhibition features 49 works produced at this camp. With themes broadly reflecting the artists response to problems and ideas that have universal relevance, instead of merely depicting personal thoughts and experience, it provides an interesting insight into the changing responsibilities of artists and the role of art in our society.

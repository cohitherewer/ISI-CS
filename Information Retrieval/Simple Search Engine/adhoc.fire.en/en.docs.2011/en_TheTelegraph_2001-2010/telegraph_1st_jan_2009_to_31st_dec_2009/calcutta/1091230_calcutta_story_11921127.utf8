The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Year-end traffic choker
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Year-end traffic choker
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Trinamul draws first blood at Esplanade. (Pradip Sanyal)                                  
	Trinamul Congress supporters threw traffic haywire at the city centre for six hours on Tuesday, signalling the start of a five-day rally ruckus with Citu set to join the fray on the last day of the year.        
	The traffic-stopper rally to commemorate the third anniversary of Mamata Banerjees marathon fast over Singur in the Metro channel came barely 24 hours after the Trinamul leader escaped a traffic logjam on VIP Road in an auto.        
	There was, however, no escape route for commuters caught in the mid-day snarls triggered by Mamatas supporters. From noon till 6pm, every road converging on Esplanade was chock-a-block with honking vehicles that barely moved.        
	The Trinamul gathering was not huge but large enough to choke traffic, especially on the stretch between the Park Street flyover and Ganesh Chandra Avenue. The average speed of vehicles till around 6pm was not more than 10km per hour, said a sergeant struggling to keep traffic moving at the Dorina crossing.        
	By 3pm, the police were forced to close the western flank to traffic with the Trinamul workers squatting on the road.         
	Sources said the disruption would have been worse had the Calcutta Municipal Corporation not hurriedly repaired the portion of the road in front of the Metro channel that had caved in on Monday.        
	Thursday holds out the threat of not only more traffic pain but also the possibility of a clash between the Trinamul and Citu over who gets to hold the city centre to ransom.        
	Trinamul Youth Congress chief Madan Mitra warned that Bengal would be in flames if the party was not allowed to hold its programme in the Metro channel.        
	There is no question of changing our plan to hold a rally on December 31. We have asked the police to ensure that the scheduled venue is free, said state Citu president Shyamal Chakraborty, a member of the state CPM secretariat.        
	But sources said chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, scheduled to address the rally, might skip the event.

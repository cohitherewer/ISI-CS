										      Free radical                        Quit playing games: A still from Jim Jarmuschs Coffee and Cigarettes, a film about the pleasures and pains of nicotine and caffeine				                           
	Its nights like these that wake up the devil in me. The crows outside my window are silent at last. The rain cant seem to decide whether it wants to stay or go. Not a soul or sound in 10 miles of me: only shadows prowling round the corner, the low hum of the ceiling fan...        
	I know whats coming, so I take a deep breath and make myself a cup of green tea. I take it to my desk, switch on the laptop and start trawling through the daily banalities of my friends, foes and psychotic admirers on Facebook.         
	As I sip, faint ughs escape my lips. I feel perversely virtuous for giving a safe passage to the piss-scented fluid down my throat. Anything to doze off to oblivion. At this point, after Ive discovered the latest quizzes, a new vampire name for myself, found out who got poked, superpoked or tagged, who got into, or out of, a relationship with whom, I feel mightily satisfied. So much so that sometimes I pleasantly surprise myself with a big yawn, and before you can say bingo, Im bundled in my bed, drifting off to another night of fitful dreams that can scare the living daylights out of Sylvester Stallone.         
	But its alright, as long as its not one of those nights when Im forced to opt for Plan B. Which happens to be watching yet another Tamil superhit on late-night TV. I try to sit still, stop wiggling my toes furiously, and concentrate on the action on screen. But busty ladies making out with bustier men, sporadic outbursts in a language interspersed with vague animal sounds, and villains emitting bloodcurdling growls dont bore me enough to put me to sleep.         
	In fact, they spike me up all the more, which brings me to the sad, but obvious, truth: my IQ is regressing. Which doesnt matter. Isnt intelligence anyway overrated these days?         
	As this last refuge goes bust, my head starts filling up with violent ideas: to begin with the head itself, it no longer seems precious enough to stop myself from bashing it on the nearest wall. I start biting my nails breathlessly, choking on nail-ends, hyperventilating, a banshee-like scream stuck at the base of my throat, about to burst out into a blubbering, snot-dripping, spit-dribbling, curling-up-on-the-floor kind of hysteria.        
	This is what you get when you royally screw up your already screwed-up life by trying to quit nicotine. Its worse that a break-up. Actually, its more like having a fling on the side. All day long, you itch for a quickie. A peppermint at the end, and no one has to get any wiser. Its this illicitness thats the turn-on. And thats why Ive lost count how many times Ive given up the deathstick in the last 10 years. Sometimes Ive quit 24 times in 24 hours. My will power never ceases to amaze me.         
	A few years ago, someone I was desperate to date, asked me to stop smoking, and I did for a while. But when the dating thing did not take off, I went on a full-blown rebound, puffing away with manic fury. I wonder, in hindsight, if I would have been any less miserable even if we had got together. Withdrawal syndrome would have forced me to withdraw my love life, Im sure.         
	As for good influences, my closest friends are all female and passionate smokers, which hasnt exactly helped things. After seeing John Abraham turn putty in the hands of a smokophobic freak in No Smoking, I woke up in a cold sweat several nights, screaming, biting my hands to stop the shivering, trying to gross myself out by thinking about my squelchy-pink lungs withering away to a sad, black rag. No nicotine days stretched blissfully to months  then, a few drinks at a party, and before you know it, the darned little stick was back between my lips.         
	W.H. Auden put his chain smoking down to insufficient weaning (I must have something to suck). Thats complicated. Mark Twain put it even better: It has always been my rule never to smoke when asleep, and never to refrain from smoking when awake.         
	Thats deep. By the time you quit smoking, lets face it folks, youd probably all be dead. Thats my two cents. Make no mistake, smoking is indeed very injurious to health  though quitting can be worse.

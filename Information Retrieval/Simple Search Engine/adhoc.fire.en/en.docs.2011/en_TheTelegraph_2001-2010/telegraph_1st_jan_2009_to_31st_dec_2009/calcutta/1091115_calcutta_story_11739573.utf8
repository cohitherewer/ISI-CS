                              Jake Arnott. (Amit Datta)                            
	If the comic book, ironically for its name, is turning more serious, what is happening to crime fiction?         
	The classic detective novel, alas, seems to be dead. In the post-modern world, where certitudes are infra dig, there is no place for the neat plot, or the sure-footed detective who can locate truth and restore it.         
	Theres not much left to hope. So crime fiction has become even darker, noir. The other author that British Council presented in the Lit Sutra series was Jake Arnott. The thriller and noir writer spoke about his writing at Starmark, Elgin Road, on Thursday. He was in conversation with Niladri Chatterjee, who teaches English at Kalyani University.         
	Arnotts books  he has written five novels  have received high praise from reviewers, but also from as unlikely a person as the musician, David Bowie. But Arnott is as much a fan of Bowie as Bowie is of him.         
	Arnotts novels are hard-boiled crime stories. His first book, The Long Firm, is the story of Harry Starks, a homosexual East End gangster in the 1960s. It was turned later into a BBC television series featuring Derek Jacobi as a corrupt Tory Peer.         
	His latest, The Devils Paintbrush, from which he read out, starts ominously with an encounter between a disgraced former British army officer and the occultist Aleister Crowley, who announces himself rather menacingly.         
	It is not possible to write crime stories as before, Arnott told one of his questioners. It is not possible to have solutions to mysteries; for solutions to mysteries are not possible. The worlds problems cannot be resolved like that. It is not possible to restore order, for there is chaos everywhere.         
	It is only possible to write of the corruption. He writes, Arnott said, of the fallen world.         
	He came to writing after trying acting, at which he was bad, he said. (A website says he appeared as a mummy in the film The Mummy.) He became a writer. But it was not easy. His advice to aspiring writers: Prepare for a lot of failure.

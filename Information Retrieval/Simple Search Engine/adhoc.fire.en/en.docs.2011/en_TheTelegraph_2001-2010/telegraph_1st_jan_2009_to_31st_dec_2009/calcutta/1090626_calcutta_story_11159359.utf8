The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Power cuts for hours 
                                                                                                               Power cuts for hours 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Power cuts stretching for hours returned to the city on Thursday after a two-day break.         
	The shortfall in supply because of lower power import from agencies outside the city increased from 130MW at 2pm to 152MW at 7pm.        
	Officially, the power cuts ranged from 60 to 90 minutes in CESC-served areas of the city and Howrah. Residents of central, north and south Calcutta, however, complained of blackouts of much longer duration.        
	There was a power cut for three-and-a-half hours in our neighbourhood. There were no power cuts in the past two days but the respite proved to be shortlived, said Papiya Chatterjee, a homemaker who stays on BB Ganguly Street in central Calcutta.

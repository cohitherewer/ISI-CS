The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Slo-mo crackdown lets smoking autos rule road
                                                                                                               Slo-mo crackdown lets smoking autos rule road
  - GUZZLE KATATEL, SPEW POISON                                                
	Calcutta might not see the last of its polluting two-stroke autos for at least another decade if the pace of Operation Phaseout remains what it is.        
	Of the 40,000 registered two-stroke autos that need to be replaced with LPG-compliant green autos, only 450 have been consigned to the junkyard since January. The rest of the fleet and 30,000 more unregistered autos roam free on the streets, guzzling katatel (adulterated oil) and spewing toxic pollutants into the air we breathe.        
	 The process of conversion has been very slow to say the least. We have delivered not more than 200-odd autos since the high court decided to monitor the implementation of the replacement scheme. At this rate, it could take us another 12 years to complete the task, says an official of Bajaj Auto Ltd, which supplies green autos.        
	Metro compiles a report card on the progress of conversion, the polices action against unregistered autos, and the crackdown on katatel ahead of an imminent high court review.              
	CONVERSION              
	What the government was supposed to do        
	The government advocate had promised the court during the January 9 hearing that 3,000 two-stroke autos would be replaced with four-stroke green autos every month. Status reports were to have been submitted to the court at regular intervals.        
	What has been done        
	Around 20,000 auto operators have applied for the conversion scheme but the transport department has cleared only 2,288 applications. A mere 267 have received sanction for bank loans (till end-February).        
	Whats slowing down the phaseout process        
	The government blames allegedly unresponsive auto operators for the scheme progressing at a snails pace. According to one official, more than 50 per cent of the applications are incomplete. Around 750 auto operators allegedly havent responded to the offer letters issued by the state government.         
	Representatives of the auto unions accuse officials of delaying the processing of papers.        
	Whats the official word        
	We are trying our best, says Dilip Bakshi, a senior official of the transport department.              
	CRACKDOWN              
	What the police were supposed to do        
	The high court asked the police to allow registered two-stroke autos to ply on the streets till further orders but continue the crackdown on illegal autos. Around 30,000 illegal autos operate within city limits and the suburbs.        
	What has been done        
	The police claim 47 illegal autos have been seized since January 9, when the court decided to monitor the implementation of the phaseout of polluting autos.        
	Whats stopping the cops from stepping up raids        
	Lack of will and red tape. A special team was to be constituted to step up the crackdown on illegal autos but the promise made to the court was quickly forgotten. Officers say raids cant be conducted without infrastructure, including vehicles.        
	Whats the official word        
	Since mid-February, the department has been busy with the month-long drive against traffic violations. We are booking offenders and slapping spot fines but illegal autos are not within the purview of this campaign, says a senior officer of the special raid section of the traffic department.               
	KATATEL              
	What the police were supposed to do        
	Cut katatel supply to the citys auto fleet, especially from the suburbs, and report to the court at regular intervals.        
	What has been done        
	Calcutta police have done precious little but their counterparts in the South and North 24-Parganas districts have seized around 62,000 litres of adulterated fuel in one-and-a-half months. Some 46 people have been arrested and 34 cases registered. In South 24-Parganas, around Rs 30,000 has been seized from various katatel counters along with cans of spurious oil.        
	What cops in the district have done right        
	Concerted raids and co-ordination between South and North 24-Parganas police.        
	Whats the official word         
	We swung into action in mid-January and never let the foot off the pedal, says Surojit Kar Purokayastha, the inspector-general of police, south Bengal.

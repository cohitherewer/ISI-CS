	Two traders, a teenager and a youth were killed when a truck rammed into a taxi and two riders lost control of their bikes on Saturday night and Sunday.         
	Keya Majumdar, a 17-year-old resident of Ghola in Sodepur, sustained multiple head injuries when her father Kishores motorcycle on which she was riding pillion skidded off VIP Road, near its intersection with Jessore Road, around 9.30am on Sunday.         
	The unconscious girl was rushed to a private healthcare unit in the area, where she was declared dead.        
	Kishore, who sustained minor injuries, told police that he lost control of his motorcycle after it was hit from behind by a lorry.        
	None of the pedestrians who saw the mishap corroborated the claim. We are checking whether the two-wheeler was hit by any other vehicle, said an officer.         
	Two partners of a catering company were killed after a speeding truck smashed into the taxi in which they were travelling in Old Court House Street on Sunday.         
	The truck was escaping after hitting another car. It rammed into the side of the taxi, in which Subrata Sarkar, 67, and Ratan Bose, 57, were returning to their Bhowanipore flats from Konnagar along with two of their employees.         
	Sarkar and Bose died on the spot. Taxi driver Gangaprasad Chaubey and Manoj Bera, one of the employees, were admitted to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital. The fourth man in the taxi escaped unhurt, said a police officer.         
	The truck driver fled leaving the vehicle.        
	I spoke to my father around 2am and he said he would reach home in 30 minutes. When I called him around 3am, someone else took the call and told me about the mishap, said Boses son Rahul.        
	Prabir Roy, 27, died when the motorcycle he was riding crashed into a truck on Sonarpur-Rajpur Road late on Saturday. He was declared dead at a local hospital. The two persons riding pillion were admitted to the hospital with critical head and spine injuries.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Robbery bid leader
                                                                                                               Robbery bid leader
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Police have identified the mastermind of the robbery bid at a Prince Anwar Shah Road house last Saturday night as Kalam.        
	The Baruipur resident, however, was not among the four who raided the two-storey house of the Roychowdhurys. He was outside and fled when local residents started chasing the gang. Three of the robbers have been arrested. It was Kalam who hired all members of the gang, said an officer investigating the case.        
	Madhumita Roychowdhury, 48, was alone in the house with two help when the gang struck. The landlady, a schoolteacher, let the four in after they introduced themselves as house painters.        
	Madhumita raised an alarm when the youths started ransacking the rooms. They tried to flee but the woman caught hold of one of them. Of the rest, two were caught by local residents. The police said Kalam was well-informed about the family and knew that the landlady would be alone.

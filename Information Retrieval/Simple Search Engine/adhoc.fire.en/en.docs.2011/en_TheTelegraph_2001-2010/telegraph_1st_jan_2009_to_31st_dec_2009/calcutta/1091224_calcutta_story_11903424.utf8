The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Number boost for red-light ranks
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Number boost for red-light ranks
  - Govt adds judicial officials to the list of car beacon entitlement          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                                                  
	The state government has included a host of judicial officials among the dignitaries entitled to the car beacon, ignoring a popular opinion that the list needs to be pruned to prevent rampant abuse of the privilege.        
	The transport department filed an affidavit in the high court on Wednesday, announcing that the list of people allowed to flash the beacon had been extended through a gazette notification published on October 28. This was the second modification to the list since it was drawn up in September 2007.        
	Among the new beacon beneficiaries are the registrar-general of the high court, all 17 district judges, chief judges of the city civil and sessions courts and the municipal commissioners.        
	Following a petition moved by lawyer Subroto Mookherjee, the division bench of Justice K.J. Sengupta and Justice M.A. Ghani had in September asked the government to file an affidavit stating why senior judicial officials were being denied the beacon when administrative officials of equivalent ranks were enjoying the right.        
	In response to the court order, the government chose to add more names to the already bloated list of 100-plus dignitaries instead of stripping a few administrative officials of the privilege, said lawyer Sailendu Rakshit. Therell soon be more beacon-fitted cars on the road than regular ones, all demanding special rights in violation of traffic and parking rules. The government is solely responsible for the chaos.        
	An officer of the traffic police department agreed. Ideally, only ambulances and police vehicles on emergency duty should be allowed to use the beacon, he said.        
	Members of the judiciary, however, were not happy with the list revision as they were expecting more. Advocate Mookherjee on Wednesday pleaded with the bench that additional district judges and the chief metropolitan magistrate of Calcutta be also included in the list. The bench assured him that the plea would be considered when the court resumed after the winter recess in January.

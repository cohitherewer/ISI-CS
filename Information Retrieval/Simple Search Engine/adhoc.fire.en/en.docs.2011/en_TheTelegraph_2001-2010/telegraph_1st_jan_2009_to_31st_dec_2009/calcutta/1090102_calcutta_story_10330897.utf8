	The body of a five-year-old girl  Ankita Manna  was found in an abandoned jute mill at Dakshindari, Lake Town, on Thursday morning.        
	Some people who entered the mill complex early on Thursday saw two legs jutting out of a bag lying beside a ditch, said Balaram Das, a resident.        
	They raised an alarm and pulled the body out of the mud. Ankitas family members, who live barely 150 metres from the mill and had been searching for her since the previous night, rushed to the spot on hearing about a girls body being found.        
	The police were informed and she was taken to RG Kar Hospital, where she was declared dead on arrival.         
	The body was stuffed inside a gunny bag and dumped in the mud, said Sujoy Chanda, the additional superintendent, Bidhannagar.        
	The police said the body was semi-clad when found. Her family said Ankita was wearing a sweater and trousers when she left home.        
	Ankitas mother Ratna said they were residents of Gobindapally in Kestopur and had come to her parents home in Dakshindari a month ago for husband Tapass medical treatment. Tapas is an autorickshaw driver.        
	Ankita was our only child. She was very friendly with the residents of Dakshindari. On Wednesday, she went out at 9pm to watch a programme organised by the residents for New Years Eve. She said she would be back in five minutes, said Ratna.        
	When she didnt return till late at night, Ankitas maternal uncle Laltu Mondal lodged a missing complaint.        
	On Thursday, as news of the girls death spread, angry residents demonstrated in front of the jute mill demanding the immediate arrest of the murderers. Police have started a murder case and are awaiting the post-mortem report.

	Income tax raids on the directors residences and other properties of a Calcutta-based glass container manufacturer and a stock trading firm yielded unaccounted for cash and jewellery of over Rs 3 crore on Friday and Saturday.         
	Mahesh Shah, the additional director of income tax (investigation), said two firms were raided but refused to give details. Sources said the glass factory directors admitted to an undisclosed income of over Rs 40 crore and the share firm directors of over Rs 15 crore.

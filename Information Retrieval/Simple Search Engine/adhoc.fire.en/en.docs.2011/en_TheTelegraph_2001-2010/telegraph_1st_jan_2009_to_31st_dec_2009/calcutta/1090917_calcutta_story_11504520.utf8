The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Gaffar and gang sent to jail custody
                                                                                                               Gaffar and gang sent to jail custody
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Gaffar Mollah and five of his aides were sent to 14 days judicial custody on Wednesday after police told the chief judicial magistrate that they need not be kept in police custody any longer.         
	The court also denied bail to Vedic Realty managing director Raj Kishore Modi, who had pleaded for bail citing his wifes serious illness.         
	We objected to the bail pleas of Gaffar and his men as they might tamper with evidence or intimidate witnesses if released. The police are still collecting evidence in the case, said Bikashrnajan Dey, the acting public prosecutor.        
	The court granted Gaffar bail in three cases on Wednesday. Gaffars lawyer Siddharta Ghosh told the court the police were fabricating evidence against him. The police had lodged 13 cases against Gaffar. He has been granted bail in nine of them but he can only be released after he gets bail in the four remaining cases, relating to murder and land-grabbing, said Ghosh.         
	The defence lawyers demanded the prosecution submit a forensic report in court to establish that the bullet that killed a youth on the night of the Vedic Village arson was fired from one of the guns seized from the resort. The public prosecutor told the court that the police were yet to receive the report from forensic officials and it would be produced in court at the next hearing.         
	The police on Wednesday raided some places in Chanpagachi, where Gaffar and his gang used to operate. Lakshman Ghosh, one the men arrested with Gaffar, told us some arms had been hidden behind a tea stall in Chanpagachi. We recovered two country-made revolvers and several bombs, said an officer.

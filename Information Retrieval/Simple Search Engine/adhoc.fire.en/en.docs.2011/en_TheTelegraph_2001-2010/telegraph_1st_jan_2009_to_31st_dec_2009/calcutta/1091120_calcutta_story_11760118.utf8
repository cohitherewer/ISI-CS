The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Christmas eggs to be costlier
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Christmas eggs to be costlier
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A strong seasonal demand and low supply have pushed up egg prices in the city, with wholesalers warning that the upward trend would continue through Christmas.        
	Traders said the price of eggs had risen by more than 18 per over the past five days  from Rs 3.20 a piece on Sunday to Rs 3.75 on Thursday.        
	Wholesalers in Sealdah and New Market and in Howrahs Dobson Lane attribute the abrupt rise to low supply from Andhra Pradesh.        
	I have never seen such price rise before the official onset of winter, said Rahamatullah of National Egg Stall in New Market.        
	Traders said more than 20 million eggs reached the city markets daily, 96 per cent of which were sourced from Andhra Pradesh.        
	Bhibuti Bhusan Saha, the president of the Sealdah Egg Merchants Association, said the daily arrival from Andhra Pradesh had come down from 40 trucks a few days ago to 25 trucks.        
	Since Christmas is just a month away we think the price of eggs will increase further, he said.        
	Christmas sees a spurt in the demand for eggs, a compulsory ingredient in the seasons delicacy  cakes.        
	But why is the supply from Andhra Pradesh so low?        
	Suppliers in the southern state have told us that egg production in Bangladesh, Nepal and some Southeast Asian countries has dropped drastically because of rampant culling of birds following a bird flu scare. Egg suppliers in Andhra are exporting bulk of their produce to these lucrative markets, said Saha.

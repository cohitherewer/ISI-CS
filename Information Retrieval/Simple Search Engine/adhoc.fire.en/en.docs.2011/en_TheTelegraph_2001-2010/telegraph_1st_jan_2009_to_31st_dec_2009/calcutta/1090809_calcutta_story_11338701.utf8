                                                                                                               Next weekend you can be at ... Kiriburu
                                                
	Barbil appeared to be a very busy station as we got off the Janshatabdi Express around 11am. Passengers and coolies milled about and hawkers peddled their wares. The whole foyer-like area outside the platform which extends to the road was shaded by sal trees.         
	From the station we took a car and started off for the twin hills of Kiriburu and Meghataburu in the West Singhbhum district of Jharkhand.         
	The car travelled from Barbil via Barajamda towards Kiriburu. Truckloads of iron-ore coming down from Barajamda, Nuamundi, Barbil, Danguaposi mines trundled along the road. Our car would pass through the Saranda forest range; and Chaibasa, where Shakti Chattopadhyay composed some of his poetry, is not far.         
	The sal forest on either side of the road looked beautiful. We took a 10-minute break on the way before reaching a point where the road split and one headed towards Kiriburu.         
	Sal, teak, dhaura, mahul, kumbhi, moi, harida and many other varieties of trees bordered the road. We saw monkeys swinging from the branches. As we went along, they scooted away, leaving the branches swaying.         
	We reached Kiriburu in the afternoon. Situated at a height of 4,300ft, Kiriburu offered a mesmerising view.         
	The township has been developed by the Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL). The tranquil place is surrounded by hills on three sides.                   
	We put up at a Saranda rest house. As the sun set, the electric lights were turned on, all the way up to the top of hills of Meghataburu, from where, local residents say, 700 hills can be seen from a single spot.         
	Mining continued in the evening. It seemed as if the hills were speckled with lights. No one was keen to go to bed, and we all stayed up till late, listening to the birds in the trees.         
	Next morning we went for a walk in the mist around Kiriburu and Meghataburu. The name Kiriburu originated from the tribal words kiri, which means elephant, and buru, which means hills surrounded by clouds.         
	At 10am we started for the Pundul falls, 20km from Kiriburu. The forest is dense here. The leaves of the sal trees brushed against our car as we travelled. The road became narrower and the tyres sunk in the bed of fallen leaves.         
	In the middle of the dense forest we found the Swapneswari Temple. The dilapidated temple had an idol of Goddess Durga and a Shivlingam. A priest conducts the daily puja.                   
	A little away was a waterfall where the Karo river descends from the hills. The river water is crystal clear here. The spray of water at the fall and the song of birds made the visit charming.         
	Elephants visit the forest regularly. Bears, deer and boars are also found.         
	After a while, the road disappeared into the dense forest and we could not proceed further. We lost our way in the forest while returning but some tribals guided us back to the road.        
	We returned to Kiriburu town around 4pm.         
	Next, we headed for the hilltop at Meghataburu for a view of the sunset. Birds returning home against the crimson sky of the setting sun made our trip memorable.        
	Going         
	Take the Janshatabdi Express, which leaves Howrah station daily, and get down at Barbil station. It takes about two hours to reach Kiriburu from Barbil via Barajamda. If travelling by road, vehicles can reach Kiriburu via Tatanagar and Chaibasa. The best time to visit is between July and December.               
	Staying        
	Rest houses maintained by SAIL are an option. There are lodges too. Rest houses have to be booked before arrival. Tariff is Rs 300-700. Bookings can be done at Ispat Bhavan on JL Nehru Road. Contact B.D. Ojha (Kiriburu) for booking: 9430109755                    (METRO ON SUNDAY THANKS READER SAMIR CHAKRABORTY FOR THIS CONTRIBUTION.

          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Around 70 CBSE Class XII examinees and their parents agitated outside a Salt Lake school on Tuesday afternoon accusing the authorities of withholding marksheets and other irregularities.        
	The director of Salt Lake Collegiate School, B.K. Sharma, and his son Aditya Baisya Sharma, a senior official of the institute, were arrested in the evening on the basis of a complaint by a group of agitators.        
	The school in BE block, offering classes I to XII, is not affiliated to the CBSE board. The 63 boys and girls who studied Class XII at the school wrote the board examination as students of Panisheola Indira Smriti Vidyapith in Hooghly.        
	They were handed duplicate marksheets after declaration of results and are facing problems while applying for admission to colleges.        
	Panisheola Indira Smriti Vidyapith has not handed over the marksheets since we owe it Rs 10-12 lakh. We are trying to arrange the money, said the director.        
	Guardians alleged they were not informed that the school was not affiliated to the CBSE board, which was denied by B.K. Sharma.        
	Anurup Mukherjee, one of the examinees, said: Many of us have got average marks in the board exam. The school has very poor infrastructure. Classes were irregular there is no laboratory. Sometimes, a single teacher taught all the subjects.        
	According to sources, most of the students took admission to Salt Lake Collegiate School in the senior classes by paying a donation of Rs 30,000 to Rs 50,000 after being expelled from other schools for various reasons.        
	The school offered students the opportunity to sit for board exams without losing a year, said a guardian.        
	Roughly half of the 15-year-old schools 300 students study in classes IX to XII.

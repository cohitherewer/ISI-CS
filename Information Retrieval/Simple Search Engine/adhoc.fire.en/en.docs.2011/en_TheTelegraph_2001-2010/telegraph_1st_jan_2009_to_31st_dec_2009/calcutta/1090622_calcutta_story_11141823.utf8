	A Calcutta police car, with an allegedly drunk man at the wheel, rammed into a motorcycle on Kushtia Road in Topsia on Sunday afternoon, seriously injuring the rider and the youth riding pillion.        
	According to residents, the driver was talking to a woman in the back seat of the silver-coloured Tata Sumo (WB20G7888), moving at over 70kmph, when it hit the bike near Kushtia football ground around 3.30pm. Two bottles of liquor were allegedly found in the car.        
	The driver tried to speed away after the mishap but had to stop because of traffic congestion. After being beaten up by the mob, he and the woman took motorcyclist Sahabuddin Khan, 21, and pillion rider Mohammed Sabir to NRS hospital in a taxi. The duo fled as soon as the taxi reached the hospital. Khan was later shifted to a nursing home.        
	Residents of the area damaged the car, which had a Calcutta police board behind the windscreens, and tried to set it on fire. The car seems to belong to the police though it is not deployed at our police station, said an officer of Tiljala police.

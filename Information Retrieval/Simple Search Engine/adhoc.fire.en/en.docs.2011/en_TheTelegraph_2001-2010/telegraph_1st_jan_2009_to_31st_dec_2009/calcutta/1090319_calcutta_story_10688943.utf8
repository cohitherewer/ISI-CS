                                                  Question stumps HS examinees
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	A large number of students who wrote the Higher Secondary English examination (second language) on Wednesday complained that one question was from outside their syllabus.         
	The West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education admitted the mistake and said steps were being taken to see if the students could be compensated.        
	Question number 12a of the English paper had asked students to write a report in about 150 words on the publication of a wall magazine in school. The students were asked to write about the topics and pictures to be carried in the magazine. The question carried 10 marks.        
	Examinees at various centres said they should have been asked to write a notice and not a report. They complained that they were not taught to write reports within 150 words on such topics.         
	We have been taught to write a notice on publication of a school wall magazine, said an examinee at a College Street exam centre. We found it very difficult to answer the question. We had to try hard as the question carried 10 marks, said another examinee.        
	We have heard about the complaint, said Swapan Sarkar, the HS council secretary. We will refer the matter to the councils expert committee in English soon. The committee will decide whether the students can be compensated, he added.

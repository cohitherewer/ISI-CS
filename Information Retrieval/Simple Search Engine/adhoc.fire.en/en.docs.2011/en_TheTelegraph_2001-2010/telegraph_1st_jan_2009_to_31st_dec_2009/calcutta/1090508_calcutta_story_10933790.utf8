                      Life through the lens                    Among the very first to take up photojournalism as a career, T.S. Satyan remained a freelancer doing special assignments for national and international publications for the most part of his professional life. To reinforce his insistence that he is a photojournalist and not a photographer, his pictures have, for decades, been accompanied by text, captions, historical contexts and emotional exigencies of the period. But now, in the absence of paraphernalia that has dropped off in time, his works stand independent. Shunning the modern and evoking nostalgia, his pictures pay tribute to the essence of the human spirit. Tranquil and leisurely, they carry a pining asceticism and reflect a form of aesthetic enlightenment. Though pensive and contemplative, they are never sad. And they are hauntingly embedded with the stillness of time. Through his works, Satyan is engaged in a consuming search for human dignity in even the poorest of the poor. Even when he has photographed celebrities, his lens has scouted their simplicity and their human essence. A Long Exposure, the ongoing exhibition of his photographs, features an outstanding collection that celebrates the continuity of life as well as its paradoxes. Hosted by The Seagull Foundation for the Arts and Tasveer.                  Event: An exhibition of photographs by T.S.

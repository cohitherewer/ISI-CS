                                                                                                               Sweet trap for murdered boy     Fathers employee arrested for killing
  - Shock and anguish          A STAFF REPORTER                          Family members mourn the death of Yash Lakhotia in his house on Sunday. Picture by Amit Datta                                              
	The abductors of Yash Lakhotia, who was found murdered on Saturday, had laced sweets bought from his fathers shop with sedatives and offered them to the seven-year-old before kidnapping him, police said on Sunday.         
	Santosh Singh, the key accused who is absconding, allegedly visited Anil Lakhotias GT Road shop, Panch Bhog, and procured the sweets last Wednesday, a day before Yash was kidnapped.         
	The kidnapper had offered Yash sweets from his fathers shop to ensure that he did not sniff any plot and raise an alarm, said an officer investigating the case.         
	The cops on Sunday arrested Santoshs nephew Ganesh Choudhury, who used to work at Anils shop. We have charged him with abduction, murder and hatching a criminal conspiracy. A preliminary probe has revealed that Ganesh was aware of the plot to kidnap Yash, the officer said. Santosh talked to Ganesh for some time when he turned up at Panch Bhog on Wednesday.         
	The cops have learnt that after leaving Panch Bhog, Santosh bought a tracksuit from a shop at the Howrah Maidan.         
	The kidnappers made Yash wear the tracksuit to cover his school uniform. After killing the boy, they removed the tracksuit and dumped it a few feet away from the body, the officer said.         
	The chief judicial magistrates court in Howrah remanded Ganesh in police custody for 10 days.         
	We are interrogating him to find out more details. We suspect Santosh has fled to Bihar. Ganesh will accompany a police team that will leave for Bihar tonight, the officer added.        
	Yash, a Class II student at Liluahs MC Kejriwal Vidyapith, went missing after school hours on Thursday. His friends recalled having seen him leave the school compound with a man he called uncle, instead of returning home in a pool car.         
	On Saturday morning, residents of Howrahs Foreshore Road spotted Yashs body in a bush, barely 2 km from his home on GT Road. There were blood stains on the boys nose and a strangulation mark on his neck.         
	The bereaved family during the day accused the police of messing up the investigation. They have failed to arrest those behind the killing. Had the police acted professionally, Yashs life could have been saved, a family member said.        
	On Thursday, Howrah police superintendent Niraj Kumar Singh had said Yash had been kidnapped by someone known to the family. After the body was found, he said the chances of an abduction victim returning alive were slim if the perpetrator was known to him.        
	If he was so sure, why did his officers wait for ransom calls that never came before swinging into action? wondered Arup Jhunjhunwala, a local resident.         
	The cops suspect Yash was kept in a godown, close to the spot where the body was found, before being murdered. The godown is less than 2km from Howrah police station, Shibpur police station and the police superintendents office. Its strange that the police could not crack the case in 48 hours, said another resident.

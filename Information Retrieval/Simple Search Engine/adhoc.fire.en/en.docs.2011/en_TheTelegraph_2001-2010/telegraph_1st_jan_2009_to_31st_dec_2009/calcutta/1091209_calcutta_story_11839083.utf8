The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Transport ministers call to eliminate touts
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Transport ministers call to eliminate touts
          OUR BUREAU                              
	The transport minister on Tuesday stressed the need to simplify the issue of commercial vehicle permits to purge the system of touts, as cops started a case in the fake challan scam.        
	A senior transport department official said an inquiry was on to find out how the law could be simplified to eliminate touts.         
	I request people to directly lodge complaints with me if they are asked by transport department employees to engage touts. I will take up the cases personally, Ranjit Kundu, the transport minister, said on Tuesday.         
	From regional transport offices to the public vehicles department office to the corridor along the transport departments offices at Writers Buildings, touts are everywhere, the minister told Metro.        
	I have asked those in charge to ensure that touts are not seen in the offices but that does not necessarily rid us of the evil.        
	According to Kundu, transport operators feel that there is a need for touts in the current system. The touts let them get the job done without having to show up at our offices.        
	Most operators agreed. If the process was simpler, there would be no need for touts. But as it stands today, touts are a necessary evil, said a senior leader of a transport operators lobby.        
	After being alerted by the transport department that permits were being issued on the basis of fake challans, the detective department registered a forgery case against unknown persons at Hare Street police station on Tuesday.         
	Deputy commissioner (detective department) Damayanti Sen said her department had started a probe into the matter after speaking with senior transport officials.         
	We need to know how many people are involved in the racket, said a sleuth.

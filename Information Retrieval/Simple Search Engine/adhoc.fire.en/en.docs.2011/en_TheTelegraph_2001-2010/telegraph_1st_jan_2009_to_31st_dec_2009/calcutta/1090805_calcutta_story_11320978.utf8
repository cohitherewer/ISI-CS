The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Green autos defy union bar
                                                                                                               Green autos defy union bar

	Sheikh Nooruddin, who owns a green autorickshaw, spent the last three days playing cards at the Jadavpur police station stand, even though his three-wheeler is outside the purview of the high court ban.        
	On Tuesday, Nooruddin and the drivers of the 60 other green autos on the Jadavpur-Taratala route were back on the street, offering some respite to commuters who regularly take the 280 three-wheelers that ply the stretch.        
	The other drivers on the route had not let us ferry passengers since Saturday. We cannot afford to sit idle any more and hence, operated our autos despite threats by some union leaders, said Nooruddin, who replaced his eight-year-old two-stroke auto with an LPG one in May.        
	Those who havent are pressuring the green auto owners to stay off the road as a mark of solidarity. In a meeting on Monday night, we made it clear to the leaders that we wanted to ply our autos from Tuesday, said another green auto driver.        
	As most auto drivers on the Tollygunge Phari-Taratala route refused to stop their muscle-flexing, Noor and his colleagues operated only till Rabindra Sarobar Metro station, avoiding the stretch common to both routes.         
	The scene was similar across south Calcutta with green autos ferrying passengers despite opposition.        
	We take home around Rs 350 per day after paying for the LPG. We have to pay a monthly instalment of Rs 2,200 to the banks. In addition, there is the cost of vehicle maintenance. How can we sit idle for so many days? asked Shankar Das, who dared to ply his green auto on the Garia-Golpark route even on Monday, despite being stopped by other drivers several times.        
	The passengers were relieved. I had to wait 30 minutes to board a packed bus on Monday. I was relieved to take a green auto to the Metro station today, said Pooja Goswami, a resident of Jodhpur Park.        
	Some green auto owners felt they did not face the resistance they had feared on Tuesday because most union leaders were busy with the funeral procession of Subhas Chakraborty. I am praying that the leaders dont start pressuring us again, said a green auto driver.

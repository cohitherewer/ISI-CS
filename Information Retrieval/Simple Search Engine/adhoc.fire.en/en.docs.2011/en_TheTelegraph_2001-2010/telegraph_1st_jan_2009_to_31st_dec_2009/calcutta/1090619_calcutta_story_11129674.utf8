The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Strike brake on admission
                                                                                                               Strike brake on admission
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The students strike called by the SFI hampered the admission process in a number of city colleges on Thursday.         
	Asutosh, City, Manindra Chandra, St Pauls and Jaipuria are some of the colleges that postponed the admission process on account of the strike.        
	The colleges had postponed admissions on Wednesday evening after the CPM students wing called the state-wide strike to protest a fatal Maoist attack on a zonal committee member in Jhargram but many applicants were in the dark about the decision.        
	Hundreds of applicants accompanied by their guardians reached colleges on Thursday to complete the admission formalities and found the counters closed.        
	I learnt about the strike from newspapers but was not sure whether students would be admitted or not. I did not want to take a chance and arrived at the college with the necessary documents only to be asked to come back tomorrow, said an applicant to Asutosh College.        
	We understand that many students were inconvenienced. But we had to keep the counters closed as the admission process was not kept outside the purview of the strike, said Anjan Sengupta, the principal of Maharaja Srish Chandra College and a member of the Calcutta University syndicate.         
	A handful of colleges defied the strike. An official of Goenka College of Commerce said admissions were held as planned on Thursday.         
	Postgraduate and undergraduate examinations of Calcutta University were also held on schedule on Thursday with the SFI keeping tests out of the purview of the strike.

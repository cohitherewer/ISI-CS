	Two cabinet ministers from the UK reviewed development projects funded by their countrys department for international development (DFID) in the city on Tuesday, sparking excitement among the beneficiaries of the schemes.        
	The minister for energy and climate change, Ed Miliband, and the minister for international development, Douglas Alexander, visited Calcutta on their way back from Bangladesh.        
	The duo visited pockets of Rajarhat where DFID projects are being implemented and said a lot had been achieved in terms of poverty relief and adaptation to climate change. But the state needed to adopt a more rigorous approach to both to really make a difference, they said.        
	The urgency of tackling climate change is beyond question for this region. The people who had no hand in causing climate change-related problems are the most vulnerable and we need to take them into account, said Alexander.        
	Miliband was quick to clarify that they were not here to force India to reduce carbon emissions but to get an idea of what kind of a deal at the UN climate change conference in Copenhagen in December would help the region.        
	The ministers visited a slum improvement project in Jyoti Nagar under Rajarhat-Gopalpur municipality, one of the seven slums to be upgraded under a DFID project, and spoke to local residents and community development scheme workers.         
	Alexander said the DFID, which spends around 40 million annually in West Bengal on sectors like health and nutrition, rural decentralisation, urban development, public sector enterprises and climate change, would spend 50 million in the coming year on such projects.

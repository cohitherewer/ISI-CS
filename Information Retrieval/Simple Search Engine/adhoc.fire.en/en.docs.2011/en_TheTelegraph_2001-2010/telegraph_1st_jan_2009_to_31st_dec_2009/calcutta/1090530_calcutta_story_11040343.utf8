The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Marks fall short of mark   A+ few in HS bid to match others
                                                                                                               Marks fall short of mark     A+ few in HS bid to match others
          MITA MUKHERJEE                                                  
	Six years after implementing a slew of measures with an eye on college admissions, the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education is still far from achieving its goal of increasing the number of examinees scoring 80 per cent marks and more.        
	The success rate in HS 2009, the results of which were announced on Friday, is 82.08 per cent. But only 5.34 per cent of the total 4,59,797 examinees have managed the highest A+ grade (80 per cent and above marks) to be better placed in the race for college admissions.        
	Over the past six years we have been working hard to make our examination system more modern and scientific, on a par with other examinations, said Swapan Sarkar, the council secretary.         
	The move was aimed at increasing the success rate of students and also to enable our students to score high marks, like their ISC and CBSE counterparts. We need some more time to catch up with the number of high scorers in other boards, added Sarkar.        
	The Higher Secondary topper this year is Madhumita Saha of Lalit Mohan Adarsha Vidyalaya in Balurghat, with 94.6 per cent marks. The ISC and CBSE toppers this year scored 99.25 per cent and 97.2 per cent, respectively.        
	The gap at the top is an indication that the best Higher Secondary student is still lagging behind his or her ISC/CBSE counterpart, said a college official.        
	Given that Calcutta and some other universities have, from 2007, done away with the system of deducting marks for ISC and CBSE students during admission, HS students fear losing out to their rivals from other boards yet again.        
	More than 85 per cent students who took admission last year were from ISC and CBSE. We are expecting a similar trend this year, said the official of a reputable college.        
	In 2006, when the council had introduced grades, 1.36 per cent of total examinees had managed an A+. There was a marginal rise in the number of A+ grade holders in 2007-2008.        
	The examination reforms introduced by the council had been chalked out with a clear intention to ensure a sharp rise in the number of examinees in the top rung, year on year.        
	Question patterns were changed, essay-type questions reduced, objective-type questions increased, students allowed 15 minutes extra time to read question papers and evaluation of answer scripts streamlined to equip students better in the admissions game.        
	Council secretary Sarkar said that despite their failure to produce more high scorers, they were happy with the results given the rise in the number of students with B (45-59 per cent marks) and C (30-44 per cent marks) grades.        
	We have set a target of 100 per cent success by the end of 2017. Apart from producing more high scorers, we also need to maintain a steady increase in pass percentage to achieve our target, said Sarkar.

                      Poetry and the stage                    Theatre and poetry have always shared a fascinating relationship, each contributing to and depending on the other for creating optimum aesthetic effect. From Dramatic Poetry to Poetic Drama: An evening with Rabindranath Tagore and Buddhadeva Bose, this evenings presentation by Theatron is an exploration of this exciting, often intriguing interface between the two, through the works of these two literary figures. It will attempt to explain through readings and performances how Buddhadeva Bose wrote the play Tapaswi-o-Tarangini inspired by Tagores poem Patita. A fascinating recreation of an age-old myth, its narrative also has its origins in the myth of Risyasringa (the horned sage) in The Mahabharata. Conversely, Tagores poem Karna Kunti Sambad inspired Bose to compose his play in free verse Pratham Partha. This, too, is essentially a modern play, with the low-born Karna as its existential protagonist. Participants: Sumanta Mukherjee, Babu Datta Roy, Papiya Adhikari, Dwijen Bandyopadhyay and Goutam Halder, along with a team of enthusiastic newcomers.

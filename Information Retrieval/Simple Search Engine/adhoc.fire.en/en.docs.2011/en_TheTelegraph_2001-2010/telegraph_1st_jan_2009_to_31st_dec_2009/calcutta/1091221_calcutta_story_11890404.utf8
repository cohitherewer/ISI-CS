The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mercury drops after warm spell
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Mercury drops after warm spell
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The warm spell that continued for as many as nine days has broken with Calcutta feeling cool again from Sunday evening.        
	The days minimum temperature, however, was five degrees above normal  for the fourth day in a row  but the evening temperature was a couple of degrees lower compared with Saturday.        
	The weakening of a low-pressure trough over the Bay will result in a drop in the temperature in the city from Sunday night, said an official of the Delhi-based India Meteorological Department (IMD). Chances are the mercury might nosedive from Monday.        
	A western disturbance, now lying as an upper-air system over north Pakistan and Jammu and Kashmir, may pass through Bengal in the next few days and add to the December chill, said a senior scientist at the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting, Noida.        
	An IMD official, however, cautioned that the change might be temporary and the winter could keep playing hide and seek. One cannot say for certain how long the chill will last, he said.        
	The warm spell since December 12 had been triggered by the sudden formation of Cyclone Ward over southwest Bay of Bengal. The cyclone dissipated into a deep depression but helped generate enough moisture that trapped the heat and blocked the cold, dry wind from the north.        
	The sky on Monday is likely to be clear and the temperatures are likely to vary between 15 and 27 degrees Celsius.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Back in business the day after
                                                                                                               Back in business the day after     - Two-stroke rules as cops take holiday      ZEESHAN JAWED AND TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                          A two-stroke autorickshaw plies in Bagha Jatin on Sunday, the second day of the ban imposed by the high court.

	Smoke-belching autos played cat and mouse with the cops on Day 2 of the two-stroke ban, ferrying passengers on the sly from Nagerbazar in the north to Naktala in the south.        
	Fewer police personnel on the streets throughout Sunday meant more opportunities for the banned two-stroke brigade to ply their trade without the fear of their autos being towed away.         
	Saturday was the first day of the ban and there were hordes of policemen keeping watch. But it was easy for us on Sunday with hardly any cops around, said driver Pradip Aich, who did good business on the Baguiati-Ultadanga route.        
	Two-stroke autos were not to be seen at Park Circus and Gariahat, though. Both these high-density auto zones had a normal police presence because of a protest march by the Intuc-affiliated Auto Rickshaw Shramik Union.         
	With Park Circus and Gariahat off the route, banned autos also did not ply to and from Topsia, Esplanade, Behala and Alipore.        
	Life was back to near-normal for the two-stroke auto on the southern fringes of the city. Banned autos outnumbered the green ones in Tollygunge, Bagha Jatin, Haridevpur and Prince Anwar Shah Road with minor route adjustments to avoid running into the police.         
	Two-stroke autos that ferry passengers from Sapuipara till the Jadavpur police station crossing were seen dropping passengers on the eastern slope of Jibanananda Setu, which is beyond the jurisdiction of Calcutta police. The entire fleet steered clear of the auto stand near the crossing, which comes under city police.        
	We took a chance and operated within the areas under the jurisdiction of Bengal police, where there is no sign of a crackdown. What else can we do? We have to earn our livelihood, said an auto driver.        
	At Haridevpur, in Tollygunge, auto operators were brazen in their defiance of the two-stroke ban. The only change from a normal day was that no two-stroke auto was parked at the stand in front of Tollygunge Metro station.        
	The drivers would keep circling the area for passengers and take a bylane instead of the main road once the autos were full, said a commuter.                  A queue for autos at Sinthee More on Sunday afternoon. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta      
	A driver who owns an eight-year-old two-stroke auto said union leaders had asked him and others to exercise caution while ferrying passengers.        
	 The police do not usually keep an eye on these areas but we have been asked to avoid the Tollygunge Metro stand, lest there be a surprise raid. Tai amra aaj flying khatchi (thats why we have been constantly on the move), he said before speeding away towards Kabardanga.        
	Of the 100-odd autos that ply on the stretch from Tollygunge to Kabardanga, as many as 90 per cent are of the two-stroke variety.        
	But while the banned auto brigade was back on the streets, supply did not match demand. Long queues of commuters waiting for autos were visible across the city despite it being a Sunday.        
	There were very few autos plying in the Tollygunge area. I was forced to board a crowded minibus that creaked under the weight of passengers far exceeding the vehicles capacity, said Sayantan Chakraborty, an employee of a private company in central Calcutta.        
	Auto unions said around 3,000 autos, including 2,000 legal ones, plied on Sunday.         
	A senior official in Lalbazar promised that Monday would be different. There were only 800 police personnel on duty on Sunday but we will check for banned autos at every major intersection from Monday.

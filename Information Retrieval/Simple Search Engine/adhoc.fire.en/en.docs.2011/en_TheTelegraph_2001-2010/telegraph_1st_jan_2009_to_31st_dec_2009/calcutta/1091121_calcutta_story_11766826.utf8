          A STAFF REPORTER                           Students packed into a pool car. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Transport minister Ranjit Kundu on Friday asked the public vehicles department to crack down on pool cars operating in and around the city.        
	I have received several complaints about illegal pool cars and have asked the officials concerned to take the necessary steps. We dont know how many vehicles are operating as pool cars on the road, Kundu said after meeting senior transport officials and district magistrates at Writers Buildings on Friday.         
	According to unofficial estimates, 7,000 to 8,000 cars operate as pool cars in and around the city. Many of these cars ferry children from home to schools and back, often ignoring safety rules. Pool cars carrying students had been involved in several mishaps in the recent past.        
	Most of the pool cars are registered as private vehicles and hence, cannot be used for commercial purposes, said police on Friday. There are provisions to seize such cars and slap fines on the owners.         
	Representatives of pool car operators associations said they were not ready to buckle under pressure and threatened to go on strike if there was a crackdown.        
	The public vehicles department has already started a crackdown. If it continues, the 4,000 pool cars that are part of our association may go on an indefinite strike from Monday, said Abir Roy of Pool Car Welfare Owners Association.        
	A member of the association claimed that they had requested the government to legalise pool cars several times since 2004 and had even offered to pay registration fees higher than that for private vehicles.

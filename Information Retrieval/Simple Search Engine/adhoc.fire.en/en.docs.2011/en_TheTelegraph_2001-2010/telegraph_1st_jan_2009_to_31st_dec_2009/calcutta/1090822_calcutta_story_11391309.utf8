The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | JEE long list opens door to mediocrity
                                                                                                               JEE long list opens door to mediocrity
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	A student with no aptitude for math, physics or chemistry now stands a chance of becoming an engineer from a private institution in Bengal.        
	Teachers are up in arms against the government for giving in to the demand of private engineering colleges to stretch the JEE merit list from 60,000 to 80,000.        
	The decision was announced late on Thursday.        
	The authorities have created a situation where students who should have nothing to do with engineering will now get to study to be engineers in private colleges, said a teacher of Bengal Engineering and Science University.         
	The West Bengal Joint Entrance Board is worried, too, but it is doing the governments bidding. The general feeling is that engineering standards will decline if students ranked above 60,000 are given seats, said a board official who did not wish to be named.         
	The board has decided to hold the fourth round of counselling for students in the first week of September.        
	Nearly 3,000 of the 24,500 engineering seats in the state  mainly in IT and computer science  are vacant in private engineering colleges after three rounds of counselling. The last session ended on August 16.        
	The demand by private engineering colleges to allow students ranked up to 80,000 to compete for the vacant seats was first discussed this week at a meeting of officials of the examination board, the government and the West Bengal University of Technology.         
	This (stretching the merit list to 80,000) wont affect quality because we still dont admit any student to an engineering course if he/she has not scored an average of 50 per cent in physics, chemistry and math in the Class XII exams, said Sidhartha Dutta, the chairman of the board.        
	But is 50 per cent good enough as the cut-off point?        
	According to teachers, it is the benchmark for mediocrity. An average of 50 per cent is just not good enough. A student may have scored a little more than the required marks in physics and chemistry but done badly in math. But if the average is 50, he/she will get through, argued one.        
	Around one lakh students wrote JEE this year. Each question paper had multiple-choice questions carrying 80 marks. We may treat this as only a ranking test and say that absolute scores are not important, but one cant overlook the fact that a student who is unable to answer even five out of 80 or 100 questions correctly is not fit for a gruelling engineering course, said a professor of math.

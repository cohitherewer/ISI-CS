The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Delhi treats but city torments   Where air is filtered, mosquito debarred
                                                                                                               Delhi treats but city torments   Where air is filtered, mosquito debarred
          G.S. MUDUR IN NEW DELHI                                                
	A single mosquito sneaking into the five-storeyed building would be a breach of security. Every cubic centimetre of air from a set of rooms on the third and fourth floor is filtered before it leaves the building.         
	Meals come from airport kitchens and every room has an attached bath and toilet. Access to the building is restricted and the staff routinely move with protective clothing, facemasks, gloves, goggles and headcaps.         
	The Airport Health Organisations quarantine facility near Delhi airport provides a stark contrast to the conditions that passengers sent to the Infectious Diseases Hospital in Beleghata have encountered (see graphic).        
	In the six weeks since the new H1N1 influenza virus began spreading across the world, about 25 passengers with cold, cough or fever have been quarantined at this facility  while health authorities awaited test results on their nose and throat swab samples.        
	These patients are not sick, were keeping them here to try and prevent the infection from spreading in India, said Sujit Kumar Singh, the airport health officer in Delhi. We need to give them the best of facilities.        
	The facilities in the building  constructed by Delhi International Airport Limited for Rs 6 crore in 12 months  are as much for passengers comfort as to prevent the spread of infections  if any  from them.        
	They are designed for two classes of infections  mosquito-borne infections such as yellow fever and infections that spread through the air such as the H1N1.        
	India has no yellow fever, but we have a susceptible population and we have the mosquito (Aedes aegypti) that can carry it from person to person, said Singh. Its critical to prevent the entry of yellow fever into India.        
	All entry doors in the building are double doors with air curtains. Every glass window opens inside and comes with a wire mesh outside to prevent the entry of mosquitoes. The building and its neighbourhood are regularly fumigated against mosquitoes.        
	Passengers with flu symptoms are housed in special rooms on the third floor with negative air pressure. This prevents any air from inside going out.        
	The air from these rooms passes through special filters that render it non-infectious before it exits the building.        
	The third floor has 24 beds, but a special hall on the fourth floor, alongside laboratory facilities, can accommodate more patients if the number grows.        
	Housekeeping staff use anti-viral chemicals to disinfect and clean every room before and after a patient arrives. They spray the air, use liquid on the floors and wipe the doorknobs to kill any virus that might be lurking.         
	The second floor with 14 beds is yellow fever zone. Not a single mosquito will be tolerated here. A bloodmeal from an infected person and a flight outside for more victims might allow the insect to seed yellow fever in India.        
	Only one patient who arrived in Delhi has so far tested positive for the new H1N1 with pandemic potential. A few patients had other influenza viruses, and the rest, doctors suspect, probably just had common cold.

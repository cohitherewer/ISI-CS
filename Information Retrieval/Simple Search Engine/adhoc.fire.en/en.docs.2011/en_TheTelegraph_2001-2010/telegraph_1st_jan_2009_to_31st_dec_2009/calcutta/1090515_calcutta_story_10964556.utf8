The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Library lost in election litter   Assault keeps readers away 
                                                                                                               Library lost in election litter     Assault keeps readers away 
  - MARRIAGE HALL, THANKS TO EC          A STAFF REPORTER                          Bricks, chairs and tents make for an ugly sight at National Library a day after the election. Picture by Amit Datta                                               
	National Library on Thursday resembled a ceremony house the day after a big fat wedding, proving right fears that the Election Commission would leave the premises ravaged after the poll party.        
	Leftovers and half-burnt logs were strewn all over the place, bricks were stacked next to the tents and tyre marks besmirched the moist greens as library officials surveyed the damage to the 30-acre campus in Alipore.         
	This is terrible, a member of the staff said to a colleague, pointing to footprints on a flower bed.         
	Chief electoral officer Debashis Sen, who had promised to clean up after the poll party, said he would meet the library authorities on Friday to give them the option of monetary compensation or the services of hired workers.         
	Let the director of National Library decide what he wants and we will arrange for the same. We have absolutely no issues with cleaning up the premises and restoring everything to what it was before we requistioned it. We are also open to offering money for the institution to get the job done, Sen told Metro.        
	The poll armys invasion had begun with truckloads of bamboo being unloaded on April 28 to set up two large pandals, surrounded by four smaller ones for storage and cooking.         
	As men and machines moved in despite the campaign by readers, library staff and Metro, Sen kept assuring the management that he would ensure the campus was not vandalised as it had been during the Assembly poll in 2006.        
	One of the promises made by the Election Commission was that microphones would not be used. But as many as 20 loudspeakers blared instructions to poll personnel throughout the day electronic voting machines were distributed, inconveniencing readers and staff.         
	The number of visitors to the library  mostly students and academics  dipped by almost 40 per cent over the past week, officials said.         
	Security personnel, election officials and employees of the decorators outnumbered readers on the library premises even on Thursday. On a normal day around 1,200 readers visit the library, the countrys largest.         
	The pandals are an eyesore and the security personnel are extremely intrusive. I have had to show my identity card to armed guards several times already, said Riddhima Roy, a Class XI student of South Point School who visited the library on Thursday to find some reference books.         
	Director K.K. Banerjee said it pained him to see the damage. Counting (of votes) is slated for Saturday and we will wait until that is over to decide how to restore this place to what it was two weeks ago. The Election Commission had promised to give us back the library in its original condition. We will wait and see what it does.         
	The commission requisitions vehicles and premises for poll purposes under Section 160 of the Representation of the People Act.

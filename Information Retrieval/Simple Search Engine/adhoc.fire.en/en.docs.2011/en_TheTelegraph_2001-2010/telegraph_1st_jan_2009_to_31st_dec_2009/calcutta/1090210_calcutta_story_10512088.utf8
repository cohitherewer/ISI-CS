The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mend falls short of Maidan maul
                                                                                                               Mend falls short of Maidan maul
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	An army of CPM volunteers descended on the mauled Maidan on Monday for a repair job that lasted eight hours but failed to restore the ground to its original condition, as Biman Bose had promised.         
	Holes, tyre marks and patches of burnt grass remained across the ground even after the days repairs, proving that every rule the Left Front chairman had promised to abide by in his undertaking to the army was flouted during Sundays rally.         
	Bose had said in his undertaking that the CPM and its allies would lose the right to apply for permission to hold any meeting and/or rally in future within 3km of Victoria Memorial if they failed to adhere to the high courts ban on using chullahs and parking vehicles on the ground.         
	Subir Jana, one of the 450-odd workers deployed for the clean-up operation, said at least another day was required to complete the task. This is such a huge area, he said, picking up paper and polythene bags with a skewer.         
	What he didnt say was that the damage was huge, too.         
	Green activist Subhash Dutta, who reached the ground around two hours before the CPM workers arrived, took pictures of the destruction to show the high court. The courts order was brazenly violated by the ruling party, he said.         
	Dutta wasnt impressed by the repairs either. This is just window dressing, he said.         
	The court later asked him to file an affidavit, just as he had done after a rally organised by the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) in December.         
	When he suggested that the army, which is the custodian of the Maidan, be allowed to directly supervise events organised there, the court advised Dutta to file a petition. The army was asked to file reports on the December 20 rally by the DYFI and the one on Sunday.         
	A representative of the defence ministry visited the Maidan twice on Monday. Group Capt. R.K. Das, the chief public relations officer (east) of the ministry, said after the second inspection that more assessments would be done. There will be a joint inspection by the organisers of the rally and army officers in a few days.         
	In the area behind Mohammedan Sporting Club, which had been used as a parking lot-cum-community kitchen, workers used mud and sand to cover the chullahs but the work was tardy. Leftovers, heaps of sal leaves and chicken feathers littered the site.         
	Prima facie, ovens were used and vehicles parked within the earmarked zone on Sunday, Group Capt. Das said.         
	On whether the CPM was properly restoring the ground, he said: You might have cleaned the drawing room but what about the rest of the house?         
	One of the CPM leaders supervising the work claimed the Maidan would look as good as new in a couple of days. We have hired four trucks of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation to take all the waste to the dumping ground in Dhapa. We have also ordered a truckload of mud to fill up the holes that were drilled to put up flagpoles, said zonal committee member Abdul Rauf.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Music ploy in rob plan
                                                                                                               Music ploy in rob plan
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The recovered cash. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                  
	Mohammad Gulzar, the leader of the gang that robbed Shakespeare Sarani resident Hormuz Burjor Bhagwagar, was archiving his victims huge collection of music during the six months that he took to plan the heist.        
	Police described Gulzar as a tech-savvy medicine supplier who used to moonlight as a CD pirate and home video editor. He first went to Bhagwagars first-floor flat in Sukh Sagar building as someone who could help the 54-year-old Parsi businessman preserve his collection of music CDs in micro DVDs.        
	 During that time, he assessed the victims worth. The fact that Bhagwagar was paying him more than the market rate for transfer of CD data to DVDs was an indication of his wealth, an officer in the detective department said.         
	Gulzar was arrested on Bentinck Street on Sunday evening along with two of his accomplices, Mohammad Sajid and Abuzar Gaffar. He later gave sleuths of the detective department a blow-by-blow account of the robbery.        
	The Beniapukur resident said he came to know that Bhagwagar was a diabetic during one of his early visits. That gave him a reason to bring in his accomplices. Once I came to know that he required regular medication, it was a breeze, the police quoted Gulzar as saying.        
	Gulzar went into a huddle with his associates on January 6 and told them about the plan. On Thursday, Gaffar called Bhagwagar to say he was Gulzars medicine supplier friend and that he would visit him around 11.30am the next day. Bhagwagar made the mistake of allowing Gaffar to enter his apartment with two other men he had never met before, the police said.

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Friday indicted the state for its failure to implement orders to protect the East Calcutta Wetlands and other water bodies.        
	Alarmed at the rampant landfill along the Bypass, the division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice B. Somadder said: Courts are repeatedly passing orders restraining construction within the East Calcutta Wetlands. But the orders are being regularly flouted The state government should be more active in taking action against violators.        
	According to the norms, only the Wetlands Management Authority could take action on complaints against landfill within its jurisdiction.         
	But the court ruled that from now, residents could lodge complaints with police against any attempt at construction in the wetlands. The police will convey the complaints to the authorities concerned, the court order said.        
	Night pollution: The high court on Friday directed the state to file an affidavit stating steps it had taken to curb air pollution caused by trucks entering the city at night. The order followed a petition by activist Subhash Dutta, who claimed that 10,000-15,000 trucks enter the city at night.

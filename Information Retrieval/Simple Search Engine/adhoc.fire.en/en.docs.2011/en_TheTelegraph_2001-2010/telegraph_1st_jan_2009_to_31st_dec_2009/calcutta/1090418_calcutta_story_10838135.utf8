The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | News only in beam block
                                                                                                               News only in beam block
  - Cable operators protest entry of new player into industry          RITH BASU                                     
	Over 16 lakh cable homes could only watch news channels for over 10 hours on Friday after operators yanked the other channels off air without notice to protest the entry of a new player into the industry.         
	Cable operators affiliated to multi-system operators (MSOs) Siticable and Manthan started the blackout at 8am and were supposed to continue till 8pm. Fringe player ANBC, which operates in Hooghly, had also joined the beam block.        
	The blackout, which affected about 65 per cent of the subscribers in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area, was shortened by two hours after a meeting between cable operators and officials in the chief ministers secretariat.        
	There is no space for another MSO in Calcutta. That is what necessitated the protest, said Suresh Sethia of Siticable.         
	According to industry sources, Silver Line Broadband, an MSO floated by cable operators, is expected to start operations in the city shortly, while Orissa-based MSO Ortel is eyeing the market.        
	The bid to keep competition out of the market a day before the second season of the IPL gets underway gave fans a scare. Sanjay Mukherjee, who wrote his Higher Secondary this year, was relieved when the beam block was lifted at 6pm.         
	I was afraid that I wont be able to watch the IPL. It was a relief to see all the channels were back in the evening, said the 17-year-old.         
	The teenager had planned to catch Pulp Fiction on STAR Movies on Friday afternoon but missed out.        
	Music teacher Aparajita Saha could not watch her favourite soaps. It was frustrating to miss Sonar Harin on ETV and Aye Brishti Jhepe on Aakaash Bangla, she said. To make matters worse, her cable operator, P. Maity of North Satellite Line, could not say why the channels were off air.        
	We were assured that the government would look into the matter and have withdrawn the protest for now but we might have to resume our agitation if our demands arent met soon, said a Cable Shilpa Banchao Committee member who attended Fridays meeting.        
	We also asked officials at Writers to grant us the status of an industry, in the absence of which we do not get loans to upgrade our networks, said Alok Sharma, another cable operators organisation.        
	Fridays beam block could cost the cable operators dear, said an industry insider citing a Telecom Authority of India rule. A cable operator is supposed to give customers 21 days notice before discontinuing a channel. Any aggrieved customer can drag the cable operator to court, he added.

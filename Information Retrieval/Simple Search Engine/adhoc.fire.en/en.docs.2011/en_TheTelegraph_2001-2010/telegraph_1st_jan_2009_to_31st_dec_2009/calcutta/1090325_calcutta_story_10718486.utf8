                                                                                                               Peon in net for stealing 23 lakh
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 35-year-old man was arrested on Monday night on the charge of stealing Rs 23.5 lakh from the central Calcutta office of a stock trading firm on Sunday. Police said the entire amount was recovered from Sunil Ram.        
	Ram, a peon of a jute mill office, was arrested following a complaint by Balakrishna Sikaria, the owner of the stock firm. The two offices are within a few metres of each other on NS Road, said Jawed Shamim, deputy commissioner, detective department.        
	The police found the door of the stock firm, on the first floor of a three-storey building, broken when they went to investigate on Sunday morning. Local residents told the cops that they had spotted Ram, a resident of Rishra, enter the building on Sunday morning. We suspected Ram as the offices in the building remain closed on Sundays, said an officer.         
	Ram admitted during interrogation that he did not return home from office on Saturday evening, the officer added.        
	He broke open the door of the stock firm and took out the money from the cash box. Being the peon of the jute mill office, he had the keys with him. He kept the money in a locker in the office, the officer said.

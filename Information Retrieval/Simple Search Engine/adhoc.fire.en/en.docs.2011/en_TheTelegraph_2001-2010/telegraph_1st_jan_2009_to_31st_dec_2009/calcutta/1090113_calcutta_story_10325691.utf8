The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | New road to ease Bypass chaos
                                                                                                               New road to ease Bypass chaos
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                                            
	Motorists who take the Bypass route to the heart of the city every day and are caught in peak-hour traffic snarls at the Parama rotary can expect a smoother ride from Puja.        
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has lined up a 2.5-km road from Chingrihata to the Park Circus connector to ease the pressure on the EM Bypass. Once the road is complete, motorists headed for Park Circus or coming towards Salt Lake, Rajarhat and the airport from there can avoid the busy stretch from Chingrihata to the Parama rotary.        
	Vehicles coming from Park Circus will then take a left turn between Milan Mela and ITC Sonar Calcutta and meet the EM Bypass at Chingrihata. Park Circus-bound traffic will be diverted at the Chingrihata end of the new connector.        
	The volume of traffic will increase manifold once Milan Mela, the citys new trade fair ground, starts hosting events more frequently. This road is meant to pre-empt chaos in that area, a CMC official said.        
	The substitute connector will run through the backyard of some landmark projects, including Silver Spring and DLF, before reaching Chingrihata via a 100-feet road along the southern bank of the New Cut Canal.        
	At present, any Sector V or airport-bound motorist coming from Chowringhee, Park Street or Shakespeare Sarani loses at least half an hour because of stoppages at different points along the route. Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay and police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti did a recce of the route last week.        
	The budget for the project is Rs 10 crore and the entire amount will come from the CMCs coffers, the municipal commissioner said. The estimate includes the cost of widening the narrow road along the New Cut Canal.        
	The CMC has decided on alignments at two places to avoid disputes and encroachment, Bandyopadhyay said.        
	According to the chief municipal architect and town planner, Dipankar Sinha, the proposed new road will be 60 feet wide. It will have 10 feet wide pavements on either side, leaving 40 feet for the carriageway.        
	The 30-ft-wide road along the southern bank of the New Cut Canal will be turned into a 100-ft-wide road, the municipal commissioner said.        
	The CMC intends widening the entire stretch of the New Cut Canal Road, right up to Palmer Bazar, after completing the Bypass connector. Motorists coming from Sealdah will then get a straight road to Chingrihata via DC De Road, Sinha said.

                      Freedom sacrificed at the altar of TV        Renowned French photographer Olivier Culmann carried out an extensive study, observing people watch television in Morocco, India, the US, Mexico, Nigeria, the UK, China and France. This led to the inception of TV Viewers. ldquo;Today the world is a global village and media has played an important role in achieving this. However, television is the main source of information for many across the globe, which is the main influence on their perception of the world in its entirety, which is far from reality. It is this unsettling aspect that has been captured. rdquo; explains Culmann. Culmann photographs people glued to the screen, hypnotised by the images that flicker by. He clicks that instant during which the viewers rsquo; attention subsides and consciousness slumbers, rocked to sleep by the phosphorescence of the cathode ray tubes. At that instant, they curl up comfortably on the couch and then collapse. Nothing could be more banal. And nothing more unsettling. Because that is how, in quasi immobile passivity, when the brain has gone numb, that we television viewers receive the world in its entirety. Not the real world, but an image of that world, a ghostly version of reality. The news, comedy series, broadcasts from the other ends of the planet, or from just downstairs, are plopped down before our anaesthetised eyes. Their impact is enormous. During that time when existence is deadened, that may last a few minutes or several hours, our ideas about others evolve and are transformed. Our preconceptions collapse and others replace them, inexorably. Culmann rsquo;s photos wittily ask anguished questions. He threads recurring questions about human freedom and its conditioning on a chaplet of proud subjectivity. Anti-ethnographically, he wonders primarily about one mystery: What will become of us after all those thousands of hours spent in a cathodic trance? Hosted jointly by the Embassy of France in India and the Alliance Fran ccedil;aise de Delhi.

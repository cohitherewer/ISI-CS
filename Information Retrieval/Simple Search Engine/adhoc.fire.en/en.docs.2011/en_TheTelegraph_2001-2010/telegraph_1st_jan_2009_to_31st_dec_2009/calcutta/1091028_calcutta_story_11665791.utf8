The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Logjam begins at Lalbazar
                                                                                                               Logjam begins at Lalbazar
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Goods vehicles block the road and shops take over the remaining space in Radhabazar Street, a stones throw from Lalbazar, on Tuesday. Picture by Anindya Shankar Ray                                  
	The citys top cops claim to be unaware that parking and pavement violations begin in their backyard.        
	If illegal parking has reduced road space in the lanes adjacent to Lalbazar by half, shops have overrun the other half.        
	Around 20 furniture sellers on Radhabazar Street, leading to Rabindra Sarani, have been doing business on the carriageway with the police looking the other way.        
	I have just learnt about this problem from you. We will take strict action against those blocking the road illegally, the deputy commissioner of traffic, Dilip Banerjee, told Metro on being asked whether the crackdown ordered by the high court would begin at home.        
	When Metro visited the stretch next to the police headquarters on Tuesday, plastic chairs and tables were piled up in the middle of Radhabazar Street. The remaining road space was occupied by goods carriages and motorcycles parked illegally.         
	The joint commissioner of police (headquarters), Jawed Shamim, passed the buck. Please ask the deputy commissioner of traffic about it, he said. Deputy commissioner Banerjee later promised that nobody will be spared.        
	Pedestrians are not the only ones inconvenienced by illegal parking and encroachment of pavements in the vicinity of Lalbazar. Ambulances ferrying patients to Calcutta Gujarati Hospital, located at one end of Radhabazar Street, often cant progress beyond the furniture shops and rows of illegally parked vehicles.        
	We have complained about this to the police in writing several times but they arent bothered, said an official of the 35-year-old charitable hospital.                
	Officers of Hare Street police station allegedly come calling only to collect their share of protection money.        
	The owner of a furniture showroom said traders doing business on the road were paying around Rs 100 a week to the police.        
	Its an organised racket. The police sometimes carry out an eviction drive just to show that they are acting against encroachment. Everything is back to normal in a couple of days, said an official of Calcutta Gujarati Hospital.        
	For pedestrians, walking down the stretch is a nightmare. If rules are being flouted with impunity within a few yards of Lalbazar, then how can we expect the police to clear pavements of hawkers in other parts of the city? asked a retired teacher returning from Rabindra Sarani.        
	On Friday, the high court gave the government a fortnight to file a status report on the parking and pavement chaos in the central business district.

	Indrajit Chowdhury (name changed) is full of plans for his visit to Dhruba Chand Halder College in South 24-Parganas on October 26. He and his friends will interact with the students, play antakshari and participate in mock interviews.         
	Indrajit, 25, attends classes at Turning Point, an NGO that works with mentally challenged people from 13 to 30. It has organised an initiative to promote interaction between mainstream students and those suffering from mental illness, including schizophrenia and manic depression. We want to reach out to the young generation to address prejudices about mental illness, said Ishita Sanyal of Turning Point. The students will visit a college each month, with Bethune College next on the list.         
	Many of our students are from underprivileged backgrounds. We hope they will also benefit from the interaction, said Sudakshina Sengupta, a lecturer at the English department at Dhruba Chand Halder College.        
	The NGO students will showcase handicrafts made by them, including pottery and embroidered and painted handkerchiefs. Each group will pen their experiences, including through painting or poetry. The NGO plans to organise an exhibition displaying the students efforts at the end of the year.

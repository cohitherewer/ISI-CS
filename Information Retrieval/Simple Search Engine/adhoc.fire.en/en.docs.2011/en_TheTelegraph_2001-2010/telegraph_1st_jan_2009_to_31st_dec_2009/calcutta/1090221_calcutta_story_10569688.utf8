                Sheikh Salahuddin, 35, committed suicide by jumping in front of a Tollygunge-bound Metro train at Rabindra Sarovar station around 7pm on Friday. Metro services were disrupted for an hour between Maidan and Tollygunge stations. The body has been handed over to police.    Power supply will be affected in the Golaghata, Dakshindari, Gurudas Dutta Garden Lane, Daspara, Canal Circular Road, Bagmari, Munchibazar, Harish Neogi Street, Muraripukur, Bidhan Nagar Road, Telengabagan, Ultadanga, parts of Kankurgachhi and Maniktala areas on Saturday between 10am and 3pm because of repairs by CESC.    Water supply was disrupted in parts of Behala on Friday following a leak in a pipeline of the Garden Reach water works. The leak sprung at the DH Road-Banamali Naskar Lane crossing. The supply had to be stopped after residents protested against ankle-deep water on the road. Households beyond Banamali Naskar Lane will face a water shortage till the leak is repaired, a civic official said. Normal supply is likely to be restored on Sunday.     The 36-year-old driver of a private car died on Friday morning after an iron rod fell on his head at a construction site in Howrah. Police said the mishap occurred when Puran Bairagi was standing near a plywood shade under construction at a godown on Foreshore Road owned by his employer. Bairagi was taken to Howrah District Hospital, where he was declared dead.    Six persons were arrested on Friday for running sleaze rackets and five teenaged girls were rescued. In the first raid on a flat in the Charu Market area, flat owners Sushmita and Bijoy Roy and two sex workers were arrested. Two minors were rescued. In the other raid two women, Hasina and Gouridevi, were arrested in a red-light area in north Calcutta for confining three minors.    Government Railway Police (GRP) officers, including those posted in Sealdah, Howrah and Kharagpur, have been asked to adhere to norms laid down in the Police Regulation of Bengal while handling bodies found on the tracks. Additional director-general Dilip Mitra warned that all GRP units would be monitored following Arindam Mannas death.

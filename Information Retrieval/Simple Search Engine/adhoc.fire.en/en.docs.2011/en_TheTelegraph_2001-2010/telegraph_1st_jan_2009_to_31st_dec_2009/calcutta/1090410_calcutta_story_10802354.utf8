The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fast track to flight door
                                                                                                               Fast track to flight door

	Calcutta airport has promised domestic fliers faster transit from the terminal entrance to the aircraft door in a couple of months.        
	Conveyor belts with built-in X-rays are being imported from Holland to reduce one step of the check-in process that now takes around an hour when traffic is high.        
	The X-ray machines that scan baggage after you enter the check-in zone will be removed. You can head straight to the airline counter and deposit your baggage, which will be scanned on the conveyor belt and registered, an official said.        
	The decongestion strategy also includes creating a second entrance for passengers that will allow them direct access to the check-in counters. At present, all passengers and visitors are segregated after entering the terminal by a gate where tickets are checked for the second time.        
	The emergency exit has been converted into an additional entry point in the domestic terminal, airport director V.K. Monga told Metro on Thursday.         
	He said the long queues at the entrance would disappear once all the measures were implemented.        
	The airport authorities are also creating 700 square metres of additional space within the terminal to ease congestion. The efficiency of our system and the airports passenger capacity will go up significantly in two or three months, Monga said.         
	According to data available with the Airports Authority of India (AAI), around 4.5 million passengers use the domestic terminal every year. Sources said the decongestion plan was meant to increase the terminals capacity of handling traffic to around six million people.         
	The twin-entrance plan is already on trial, with the authorities keeping the additional gate open for four hours each in the morning and afternoon. It will be kept open for 16 hours a day once all the changes take effect.         
	 The existing gate will then become a dedicated entry point for passengers while the second one can be used by both passengers and visitors, an AAI official said. Passengers entering through the dedicated entrance will not have to undergo a second check at the segregation gate, which will reduce the time it normally takes to check in.        
	Passengers who choose to enter the terminal through the common gate will be checked at the segregation point, as is being done now.         
	On an average, 6,500 to 7,500 passengers use the airports departure lounge every day. Congestion at the entrance often spills over to the segregation point and then the X-ray counters.        
	Many passengers have complained about having to spend at least an hour in three queues before getting their boarding passes, said a travel agent.         
	A security official said delays would be eliminated for sure once baggage checking started at all 48 check-in counters in the domestic terminal. On whether a one-step screening process was foolproof, he said: There will be four levels of checking. The machines software will decide whether a luggage needs more than one level of screening. Bags sent for the third level of screening will be frisked manually in the presence of the passengers.        
	The addition of space to the terminal will also help passengers in terms of seating and other arrangements. Work is likely to be completed in three months, a source said.

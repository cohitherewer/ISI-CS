The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 4-year-old gets thumb back
                                                                                                               4-year-old gets thumb back
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A four-year-old from Lucknow who lost his thumb in an accident was operated on at a city hospital and the finger was reattached.         
	On May 31, Ajay Sharma (named changed on request) was playing in the corridor of a building in central Calcutta where he was staying with relatives when his hand got caught in the elevator door. As the car started moving, Ajay screamed in pain and one of his relatives pulled him back.         
	The thumb and 10cm of tendons were severed when the boy was pulled away from the elevator, said consultant plastic and microvascular reconstruction surgeon Manish Mukul Ghosh of Columbia and Asia Hospital, where Ajay was operated on.         
	The mother rushed the kid to our hospital but forgot the thumb. Luckily, a domestic help had the presence of mind to place it in the fridge, which is why we could replant it, said Ghosh. He added that a severed body part must be kept in a refrigerator but not inside the freezer.         
	A team led by Ghosh reattached the thumb with wires and reintroduced blood supply using a reversed vein graft to rejoin an artery and two veins of the thumb.         
	It was vital to replant the original thumb rather than use a toe because 10 per cent of the brains functioning nerve cells are dedicated for the right thumb in right-handed persons, like this child, say neurosurgeons.        
	Ajay underwent four surgeries and another is required in a month to remove the wires.

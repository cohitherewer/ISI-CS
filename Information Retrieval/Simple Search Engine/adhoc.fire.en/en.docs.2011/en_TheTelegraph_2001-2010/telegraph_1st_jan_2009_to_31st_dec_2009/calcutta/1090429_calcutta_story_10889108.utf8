The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Shield for rule-flout autos
                                                                                                               Shield for rule-flout autos
          TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                          An autorickshaw with seven on board passes the East traffic guard on Tuesday afternoon. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                   
	Overloaded autorickshaws plied under the noses of policemen on Park Circus connector on Tuesday, a day after three-wheeler drivers held up traffic for 90 minutes on the stretch to protest a crackdown against the rule flout.        
	We have been asked by the authorities not to book auto drivers at least till the elections are over, said a traffic constable posted near Bridge No. 4 as an auto carrying six passengers sped past. A sergeant at the Topsia crossing refused to comment on the drive against overloaded autos.        
	On Monday, auto drivers had blocked the connector demanding that cops stop the drive against them for carrying more than four passengers. The police had claimed that the drive would continue despite political pressure.        
	The autos plying on the connector on Tuesday carried at least five passengers. Autos can carry a maximum of four passengers.         
	Our leaders have assured us that we can carry as many passengers as we want and the police would not stop us. Earlier we could pick up extra passengers only after leaving the stands. Now, it is no more a constraint, said Naushad Alam, an auto driver on the Kimber Street-Topsia route, while starting his two-stroke three-wheeler with five passengers.        
	The general secretary of the Citu-backed auto union, Asish Ahmed, claimed he had no knowledge of autorickshaws flouting rules. The police have promised not to trouble us unnecessarily. We have also promised to obey the law. I do not have information if the drivers are flouting any norm, said Ahmed.        
	According to sources, the police have been asked to request passengers to get off overloaded autos but not to book or use force against auto drivers.        
	On Monday I missed an important meeting because of the lawlessness of auto drivers. It is ridiculous that the drive was withdrawn so quickly. Almost all autos are overloaded like before, said Soumik Bag, who works for an NGO.

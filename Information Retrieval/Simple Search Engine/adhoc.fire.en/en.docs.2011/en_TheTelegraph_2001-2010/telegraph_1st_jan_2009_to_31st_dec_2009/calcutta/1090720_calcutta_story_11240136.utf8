The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fee hike ruled out in tech colleges
                                                                                                               Fee hike ruled out in tech colleges
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Parents of students of private engineering colleges can heave a sigh of relief as the tuition fee will not be raised at least for now.        
	The state government has decided not to implement the recommendation of the fee review committee which suggested that the annual fee of the private engineering colleges be raised from Rs 41,000 to Rs 55,000.        
	An upward revision of the fee of the private engineering colleges is not possible at this stage, state higher education minister Sudarshan Ray Chaudhuri told the owners of around 20 institutions who met him last Friday.        
	The delegation had appealed to minister to implement the committees suggestion from the next academic session starting August.        
	The fee of the private engineering colleges was last revised in 2005. A hike is long overdue as according to a court ruling, tuition fees should be revised every three years, said the owner of a college in south Calcutta.        
	The government said it could not allow a fee hike before studying the panels recommendation and ensuring that the parents were not inconvenienced by the hike.        
	Sources in the education department, however, feel the government is hesitant because of the CPMs debacle in the recent Lok Sabha and municipal elections. A section of parents must have opposed the fee hike. Alarmed at its poor show in the polls, the CPM does not want to take a move that can stoke resentment among the people, a source in the education department said.        
	The process of admitting students to the first semester of B.Tech courses began last week with the start of the counselling.        
	Private engineering institutions have been demanding a hike in their students fees in order to meet the additional expenses they will have to bear to pay their staff enhanced salaries as recommended by the sixth pay commission.        
	Our colleges depend entirely on students fees. The existing fee of Rs 41,000 a year will not be enough to pay our teachers according to the revised pay scale, said Durjhoti Banerjee, the director of the Mallabhum Institute of Technology and assistant secretary of the association of owners of the private engineering institutions in the state.        
	Though the private institutes do not get government assistance, the salaries they pay have to be on a par with the government pay scale.         
	The higher education minister was not available for comments.

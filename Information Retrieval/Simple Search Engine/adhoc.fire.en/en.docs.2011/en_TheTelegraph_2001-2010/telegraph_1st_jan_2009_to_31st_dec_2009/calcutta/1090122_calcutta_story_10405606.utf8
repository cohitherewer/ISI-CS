The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Ananda Babu for ballot blues
                                                                                                               Ananda Babu for ballot blues
          DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY                          An Ananda Babu poster before the 1506 number was finalised                                  
	The state election commission is taking the Buladi route to reach out to voters. From next month, a puppet in a yellow shirt named Ananda Babu will be the face of the commissions campaign to make people more aware of election rules and help them vote.        
	Anyone can reach Ananda Babu by dialling 1506 (normal charges apply) during office hours on working days. Like his other model, Jeeves, the fictional butler created by PG Wodehouse, Ananda Babu will have a ready answer for every question, said chief electoral officer Debashis Sen. We conceived Ananda Babu to answer the queries of voters before the Lok Sabha elections. People will be able to talk to him from mid-February, added Sen.        
	The election commission receives numerous calls from voters each day. Many callers remain unsatisfied with the answers. We hope to solve the problem by introducing Ananda Babu. He will direct each caller to the person who can give a specific answer, said Sen. Funds permitting, Ananda Babu will also appear in advertisement films and billboards.        
	The commission also planned to open voter registration centres in each borough of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation from mid-February. Citizens will be able to walk into the centres to register as voters.

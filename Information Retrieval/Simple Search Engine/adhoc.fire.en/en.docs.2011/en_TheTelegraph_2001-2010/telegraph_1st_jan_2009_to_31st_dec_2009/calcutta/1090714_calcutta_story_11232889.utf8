The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bokaro cops net city duo
                                                                                                               Bokaro cops net city duo
          KINSUK BASU                              
	Two men were arrested by a police team from Bokaro on the charge of selling raw materials used for making grenades.        
	Police said a gang based in Phusro, Jharkhand, used to buy iron components from the duo and made grenades that were sold to Maoists.        
	Kartick Mondal and Sunil Pandey were picked up from Burrabazar on Monday afternoon in a 15-minute operation.        
	Mondal traded in fabricated iron products while Pandey brought customers to him. An officer of the Bokaro police said Mondal had received an order from the Jharkhand-based gang for more than 2,000 iron components.        
	The consignment was handed over to Baban Pandey, allegedly a key member of the gang, when he visited Calcutta recently. Pandey had carried the consignment from Howrah on the Shaktipunj Express and was arrested by the Bokaro police on July 11.        
	The cops soon arrested two more alleged members of the gang  Ashwani Kumar in Phusro and Yamuna Prasad in Gomia.        
	Baban came to know about Sunil Pandey in Calcutta through an acquaintance. Sunil later introduced the gang members to Kartick Mondal, said Laxman Singh, the superintendent of Bokaro police.        
	A probe revealed that Kartick had been running a shop  Mondal Enterprises  at 71 NS Road in Burrabazar for eight years. He also owns a lathe factory in Baranagars Sitalamata Lane.        
	The iron components the Jharkhand gang had ordered might have been produced in the Baranagar factory, said an officer.        
	The Bokaro police claimed that Kartick knew for whom he was delivering the iron components but the city cops were not sure.        
	It could be that Mondal was not aware that products from his factory went to strengthen the arsenal of the Maoists. He might be in the dark about the antecedent of the people he was dealing with, said Rajeev Kumar, a special inspector-general of police.        
	The gang had supplied ammunition to Navin Majhi, the zonal commander of Maoists in Jharkhand, said a source in the Bokaro police.        
	Sources in the Bokaro police said the Maoists who had fled Lalgarh had taken shelter in pockets of Palamau, Chatra, Latehar and Hazaribag in Jharkhand.

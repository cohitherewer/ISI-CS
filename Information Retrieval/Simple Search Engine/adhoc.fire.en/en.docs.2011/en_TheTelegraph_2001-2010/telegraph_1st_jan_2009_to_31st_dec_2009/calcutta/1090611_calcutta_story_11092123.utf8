  - Amherst Street college reels under admission form row          A STAFF REPORTER                                                    Police picket at the gate of St Paul rsquo;s College following Wednesday rsquo;s violence. (Bishwarup Dutta)
    
	Student violence rocking the districts since the CPMs rout in the general election drew first blood on a city campus on Wednesday afternoon.        
	Supporters of the CPM-backed Students Federation of India and the Independent Students Forum, an umbrella body of anti-Left groups, slugged it out for two hours in front of St Pauls College on Amherst Street.        
	Police said the groups hurled bombs and brickbats at each other following a row over distribution of admission forms in the college.        
	The mob dispersed after being lathicharged by the police. Five students have been arrested and booked under the Explosives Act. One of our sub-inspectors was injured, said an officer.        
	Representatives of both camps blamed the other for the trouble and claimed that several of their supporters had suffered splinter injuries.        
	Traffic was suspended on Amherst Street for around two hours from noon, with south-bound vehicles being diverted through other roads.        
	This was the first student clash in the city since the election results were announced on May 16 though reports of campus skirmishes have been pouring in from the districts over the past few weeks.        
	The SFI now controls the students unions in most colleges in Bengal. Since the declaration of the poll results, anti-Left groups have been unleashing terror to wrest control of the SFI unions. After fomenting trouble in Behrampore, Krishnagore, Bhangar, Barasat and Hooghly, the Trinamul is out to disrupt city colleges, said Koustav Chatterjee, the secretary of the SFI state committee.        
	An SFI supporter and a second-year student of St Pauls said: We have 22 seats in the college union and the opposition just three. They are creating trouble in a desperate attempt to reverse the ratio.        
	Subhajit Patra, a second-year student of the college, rubbished the SFI allegation. The admission process was on when suddenly, around 11am, an SFI crowd comprising mostly outsiders tried to barge in. They turned violent when we tried to resist them, said Patra, an Independent Students Forum supporter who was injured in the clash.        
	Javed Alam, who had graduated from the college two years ago but had turned up to oversee the distribution of admission forms on behalf of the SFI, alleged that the police had sided with their rivals during the clash. The cops denied the charge.

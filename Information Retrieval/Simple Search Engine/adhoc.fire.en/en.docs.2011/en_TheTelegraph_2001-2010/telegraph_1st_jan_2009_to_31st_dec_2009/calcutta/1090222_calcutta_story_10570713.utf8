The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | An unequal contest
                                                                                                               An unequal contest
                            A staircase at the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and (below) Beth-El synagogue				                                 
	Forty? No, 39. Shalom Raymond Israel, in his thirties, discusses Calcuttas dwindling Jewish population outside the Maghen David synagogue in a passage in White and Black: Journey to the Centre of Imperial Calcutta, a soon-to-be-published book by the journalist, Soumitra Das, that also includes photographs taken by the English photographer, Christopher Taylor.         
	In a way, Israel could have been talking about not just disappearing Jews but an entire past, manifest in the form of ornate but crumbling architectural edifices, faceless and numberless people and communities as well as an entire way of life and living that Das and Taylor have striven to capture through words and images.        
	In these pages, Dalhousie Square isnt merely a grand structure in stone, it is also the protagonist. (Dalhousie Square has not been really written on earlier from this perspective, says the author.) Das and Taylor turn it into the site of an unequal contest, between the citys past which survives precariously in its nooks and corners, and a present forever keen to purge it with the help of a garish, new reality that thrives on changing street names and raising hideous structures.         
	Ironically, as Olaf Van Cleef, the sponsor of this project, notes in his foreword, Dalhousie Square is still bound by linkages that transcend space and time. It is still a seat of power, albeit a fading one.        
	Dass engagement with heritage issues is reflected in his meticulous descriptions of architectural detail of the buildings that dot Dalhousie Square. Be it the now begrimed relief work of the Standard Building, the nettle patterned green tiles of the Currency building or the lizard-tail like fluorescent lamp of the Raj Bhavan, these are accounts of a fragile elegance. Taylor complements Das by helping the reader see what Das describes in words, whether it be the gleaming interiors of the Beth-El synagogue or the stained columns of the Old Mint.         
	Dass work is also richly anecdotal. Apart from the descriptions of buildings, it is filled with nuggets about people  the actual protagonists of the human drama enacted here.         
	Hence, we encounter not only the Jewish man with his skull-cap but other members of his vanishing tribe: Prabhat Rohatagi, who speaks flawless English and lives in a house on Armenian Street that once belonged to Huzuri Mull, the Sikh merchant who had assisted the British during the battle of Buxar, the Ariffs of Lalkothi, or Somendra Chandra Bose, who began his practice at the high court in 1949.        
	Taylor, who is with Magnum, is a gifted photographer. There is a restrained quality about his photographs, many of which make dexterous use of light and composition to convey moments of great stillness amidst a great churning.        
	Das and Taylor are not under any illusions though. Given the governments criminal ineptitude and the lack of collective interest, the best that can be hoped for is a decent burial of the citys glorious past.         
	Hence, even while documenting the enactment of a tragic apathy and effacement, they do not take recourse to nostalgia. For as Das writes while taking in the loveliness of the stained-glass window of Beth-El synagogue on Brabourne Road, beautiful vision is only a trick of light.

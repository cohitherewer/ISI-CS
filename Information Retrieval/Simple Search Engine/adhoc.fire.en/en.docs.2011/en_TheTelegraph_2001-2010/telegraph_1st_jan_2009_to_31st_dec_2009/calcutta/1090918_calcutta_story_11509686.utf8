          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A CPM supporter was beaten to death and another seriously injured at Purbalok in Jadavpur on Thursday morning.         
	Police said they were investigating whether the murder of Dilip Dhara, a 24-year-old building materials supplier, was a political one or the fallout of business rivalry. Three persons were arrested in this connection.         
	CPM workers alleged that Trinamul supporters were behind the murder and damaged an office of the party and a grocery shop in the locality. Trinamul leaders denied the allegation.         
	Dilips mother Chhabi said her son received a call on his cellphone around 1.30am. He was asked to go to a spot about 1km from our home to receive a consignment of sand. Dilip went to the spot along with friends Joydeb Mondal, Sayan Mondal and Toton Haldar, said Chhabi.         
	According to the police, the four were surrounded and attacked by about 20 armed youths at Purbalok. Sayan and Toton managed to escape from the spot but Dilip was hit on the back of his head with a hammer. Joydeb was hit with wooden planks, said an officer.        
	Dilip was declared dead at a private hospital.        
	Club claim: The Dakshin Kolkata Sansad authorities on Thursday stated that they had a licence from the state excise department to run a bar. The civic body had sent a notice to the club asking it to shut down its bar-cum-restaurant at Deshapriya Park.

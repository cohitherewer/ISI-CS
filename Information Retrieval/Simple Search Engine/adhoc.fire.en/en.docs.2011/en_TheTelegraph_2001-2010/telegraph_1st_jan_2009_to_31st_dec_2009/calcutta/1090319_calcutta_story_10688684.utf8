	Residents of Poddar Nagar in Jadavpur took to the streets on Wednesday after coming to blows on Tuesday night with some students of Jadavpur University (JU) who live in a hostel in the area.         
	The residents gave the JU authorities an ultimatum to clear the hostel, saying that they would otherwise evict the boarders themselves.         
	Some residents blocked Prince Anwar Shah Road on Wednesday morning for over four hours to protest against alleged harassment by the hostel boys. The boarders, on the other hand, accused the residents of harassment and also took out a protest march.        
	The students pass lewd comments at women and throw empty liquor bottles at our houses, said Shibu Mitra, a resident of Poddar Nagar.        
	Sources said the fight broke out around 8.30pm on Tuesday at a local shop after some residents accused the students of misbehaving with girls. They came back with hundreds of students from the hostel and threw bricks at our homes, said Mitra.        
	The students blamed the residents for the trouble. Some goons had beaten up the students. We had to get more students from the hostel to bring the situation under control, said a boarder.        
	The students claimed six of them sustained head injuries while some had broken bones after the residents lobbed bricks at them.         
	Some residents were injured too. We cant go up to our terrace for fear of their lewd comments. We cant keep our windows open. We wish there was a girls hostel here instead, said Sushmita Dey, resident of a highrise building in Poddar Nagar, whose windows were smashed by bricks thrown by the students.         
	The students hurled bricks at the residents on Wednesday too, and claimed it was in retaliation to Tuesdays violence.        
	Police said cases have been started on the basis of complaints lodged by both the students and the residents.        
	JU vice-chancellor P. N. Ghosh said the university had asked the students to stay in their rooms after 10pm. The JU authorities have also decided to block the roof from where the students had lobbed bricks.

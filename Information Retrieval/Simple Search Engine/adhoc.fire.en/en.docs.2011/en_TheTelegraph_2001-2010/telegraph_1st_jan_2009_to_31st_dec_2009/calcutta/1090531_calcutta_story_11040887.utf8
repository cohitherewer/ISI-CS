The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | She maintains motorcycles 
                                                                                                               She maintains motorcycles 
                              Paramita Das tunes a bike at her workshop. (Aranya Sen)                             
	Its not often that one comes across a woman motor mechanic. Paramita Das is 21, married and as she waits for the results of her BA exam, she has opened an authorised Hero Honda service centre.         
	She didnt always dream of her hands getting greasy in engine oil. It was the outcome of meeting her future husband.         
	Her husband Kunal (then friend) started working at a Hero Honda dealer showroom in Minto Park and his passion for bikes and two-wheelers infected Paramita. She enrolled at the Balarampur Institute of Vocational Aid for a course in two-wheeler repairing in 2007.         
	I was the only girl in my class. They were very curious to see a girl taking this up. But you cant run a business without knowledge of the product, she smiles.         
	Her family was supportive  tears well up as she talks about it. Her workshop stands on a plot in Jagaddal, Narendrapur, that belonged to her father. My husband and I always dreamt of having a workshop and starting a dealership. He says that hes going to continue with his day job (Kunal still works at the Hero Honda showroom) while I look after the shop, she says.         
	Behind her is an organisation. While studying at Balarampur Institute she caught the eye of the principal, a trainer at I Create, a non-profit organisation that promotes entrepreneurship. The principal forwarded her case to the foundation, which gave her equipment worth Rs 50,000, and trained her in an entrepreneurship programme. Her family raised Rs 1 lakh more and Das Automobiles came into being. Were trying to become authorised dealers now, she smiled.         
	Mistress of spices        
	A Salt Lake institution started by a woman has, meanwhile, turned 10. Dui Burir Henshel is a kitchen that has delivered cost-effective meals with a home-made taste to numerous homes over the years. Many in Salt Lake, from one-meal-at-home Sector V professionals to homemakers whose maid hasnt turned up to families hosting parties are grateful to Dui Buri, which gets between 100 to 150 home delivery orders every day. Their fish or chicken meal is good, and their pulao is excellent.         
	But Dui Buri, alas, is a misnomer. It was started by Indrani Brahma, 57, with her cousin, but the latter is not part of the business any more. Brahmas family manages it now, though she still decides the menu, the recipes and meets the cooks regularly.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rescued turtles go missing from zoo
                                                                                                               Rescued turtles go missing from zoo

	Two turtles, rescued from a city market and gifted to the zoo by a teenager, have gone missing from their enclosure and the authorities have no clue how.        
	Asish Chowdhury, who appeared for the ISC from La Martiniere for Boys this year, bought the turtles for Rs 70 from a market off the EM Bypass and deposited them at the zoo in end-2007.        
	The 18-year-old from New Alipore recently visited the zoo to check on the turtles and found only ducks and birds in their enclosure. The water was transparent and the enclosure was well-guarded so the turtles could not have escaped, said Asish.        
	When he approached zoo officials, he was asked to check whether the turtles were in the aquarium. The teenager could not find them there and went back to the officials. This time he was asked to mind his own business.        
	It was shocking how indifferent they are towards the animals, said Asish, who filed a complaint with the Central Zoo Authority.         
	It is difficult for me to keep track of a pair of turtles. I dont know where they are, said Subir Chowdhury, the director of Alipore zoo.        
	According to forest department officials, turtles, along with tigers, leopards and elephants, are Schedule I endangered species under the Wildlife Act.        
	The turtle population is diminishing fast and hence, trade in the animal has been banned. However, despite raids, the illegal trade continues, said a senior forest department official.         
	Turtles are prized for their meat. The two that have gone missing would have been slaughtered if Asish had not come to their rescue.         
	I knew it was illegal to keep them at home and so went to the Alipore zoo and deposited the pair, he said. Zoo officials made an entry in their register and released the turtles in the enclosure.        
	The forest department official alleged the zoo authorities rarely filed the monthly status report. They are supposed to submit a list of animals and their particulars to us. It should mention if an animal had been procured or if an animal had died. The process is not followed regularly, he said.

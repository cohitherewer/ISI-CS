The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Table-top green set for gallop amp; goal
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Table-top green set for gallop amp; goal
          SUBHRO SAHA                          A polo match on the Maidan                                  
	The ponies are primed, the riders are ready, and the grass cropped to a table-top green, as the Calcutta polo season gallops to a start with The Telegraph Carmichael Cup on Thursday at the Pat Williamson Ground on the racecourse.        
	Revived in 2006 at the initiative of Keshav Bangur after almost a decade-long hiatus forced by lack of sponsor support, the regal sport is hoping to make a comeback to its original cradle, the Calcutta Polo Club, the worlds oldest existing polo club, established in 1862 by British soldiers Captain Robert Stewart and Major General Joe Shearer.        
	We hope to dish out a dazzling display of stickwork, riding off and teamwork over the next few days of the BFL Corporation Polo season 2009 presented by The Telegraph and held in association with the Fort William Riding amp; Polo Club, said Bangur, the president of the Calcutta Polo Club.        
	The final of the Carmichael Cup comes off on December 20, with the final of The Floatel Ezra Cup, the oldest tournament in the world, scheduled for December 23. The curtain comes down on the season with the BFL Corp Polo Masters on Christmas Day, followed by the grand Polo Ball, a traditional evening gala of chiffon swish and regal razzmatazz, to be held at Taj Bengal.        
	Around 30 leading players, mostly from Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabad, along with 30-odd outstation horses, will join the local challenge posed by the Calcutta Polo Club and the Fort William Riding amp; Polo Club.         
	The exhibition ties will see the top guns try the audacious pasadita or overtaking, made famous by Adolfo Cambiaso, the best polo player in the world.        
	The trio to watch out for are Delhi biggies Angad Kalan, with a plus-five-goal handicap, Dhruv Pal Gudara and Lokendra Singh, both credited with a plus-four handicap. A team from Manipur  where the game had its early origins  to feature in an exhibition match on the final day is another highlight.        
	Its an expensive business running this sport, as maintaining the ground itself costs us over Rs 15 lakh. Then, the top players charge Rs 10,000 per handicap. So someone like Kalan, who has a five-goal handicap, would take away Rs 1 lakh for playing in two tournaments, said Cyrus Confectioner, the secretary of the Calcutta Polo Club.        
	Some sponsors like Kingfisher Airlines and The Floatel have checked into the chukkas this season, but that doesnt cover all costs.         
	We are also grateful to the Army for all their support. But we want more young civilians to come forward and play this sport and thats why we are taking polo to the city schools. This is the only way to lure corporate bucks into this splendid sport, like in Delhi where the likes of TAG Heuer and Cartier are now in the saddle, pointed out Bangur.        
	The Pat Williamson Ground this season will miss the games best-loved follower, Rajmata Gayatri Devi, who passed away on July 27.        
	We do hope the sports glamour quotient gets a lift here too, like in Delhi where Shah Rukh Khan is a regular, said Confectioner.

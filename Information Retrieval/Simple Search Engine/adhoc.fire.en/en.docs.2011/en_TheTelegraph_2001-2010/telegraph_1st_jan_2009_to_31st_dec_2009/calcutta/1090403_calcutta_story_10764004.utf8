                                                                                                               Fisheries dept flouts wetlands rules

	The fisheries department stands accused of violating its brief to protect water bodies across the state by constructing an auditorium on the East Calcutta Wetlands.        
	Benfish, an agency of the department that has been executing the project, has even ignored a stop-work order from the chief secretary.        
	A high court order and the East Calcutta Wetlands Conservation amp; Management Act, 2006, prohibit construction in the 12,500-hectare sprawl.        
	In a recent ruling, the court had observed that clandestine and illegal construction has been continuing on the wetlands and again asked the authorities to ensure that no further illegal construction is allowed in the area covered by the Wetlands Act.        
	The plot where the auditorium complex is coming up  number 502 in Dhapa-Manpur mouza  falls in Salt Lake, off Nalban.        
	Benfish is violating the wetlands act as the auditorium is coming up by encroaching on water bodies, said Nitai Kundu, the chief technical officer of East Calcutta Wetlands Authority.        
	Based on a report filed by the authority, chief secretary Ashok Mohan Chakrabarti issued an order a week ago asking Benfish to stop work immediately. But the agency, instead of carrying out the order, wrote back to the chief secretary seeking permission for the project.        
	We had received the chief secretarys order and have written back explaining our position, as advised by our minister, said S.K. Ganguly, the managing director of Benfish. The fisheries department, responsible for the upkeep of all water bodies, is headed by Kiranmoy Nanda.        
	We had no clue that the wetlands act was violated. So many agencies are carrying out construction in the zone.... However, we have applied for permission, said Ganguly. The Centre, he added, has allotted Rs 3 crore for the project.        
	When Metro visited the spot on Wednesday, construction was on in full swing. Nobody has asked us to stop construction. Around 25 workers have been working at the site daily for the past four-five months, said Bablu Sheikh, who was supervising the construction.

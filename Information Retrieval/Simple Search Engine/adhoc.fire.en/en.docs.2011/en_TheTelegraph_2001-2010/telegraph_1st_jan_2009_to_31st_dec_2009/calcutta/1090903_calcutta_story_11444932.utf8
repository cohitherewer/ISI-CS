The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Flash shutdown at mall   Rent row triggers chain reaction
                                                                                                               Flash shutdown at mall     Rent row triggers chain reaction
  - Shop stops in the dark          SUBHRO SAHA                                                            
	The buy and bite crowd at South City on Wednesday afternoon was greeted by an unprecedented sight in a city mall  an anchor store, several other shops and the food court downing shutters in protest.        
	The simmering tension between mall developers demanding higher rentals and retailers seeking sops to beat the downturn blues reached flashpoint on Wednesday with a clutch of outlets at the Prince Anwar Shah Road address, led by Pantaloons, shutting down for a few hours.        
	Rollback of rent relief lies at the heart of the mall versus retailer face-off.        
	The South City Mall management had rolled back rentals by 10 to 20 per cent for a four-month period this year as relief to retailers hit hard by the downturn. It withdrew that marketing support recently, reasoning that the tide had turned.        
	Footfalls at the mall have risen in recent weeks thanks largely to a sale wave in the run-up to Puja.        
	The 65,000-sq ft Pantaloons store, one of the main anchors, shut down around 4pm, alleging that air-conditioning to the outlet had been deliberately snapped on Tuesday.        
	Some other stores  Planet Sports, Moustache, Guess, Success, Turtle, Biba and more  and even the food court then put up closed signs in a show of solidarity with the retailers fight against the alleged high-handedness of the mall management.        
	Kishore Biyani, the CEO of Future Group, which owns Pantaloons, told Metro from London: A mall can succeed only when there is a collaborative approach. We are never going to put up with such highhanded attitude (of the management). They cant arm-twist us like this and deprive thousands of Puja shoppers.        
	The mall authorities blamed it all on unpaid dues. Pantaloons has run up AC services dues of over Rs 1 crore and our repeated pleas to pay up have gone unheeded. So we were left with no option, said Man Mohan Bagree, the vice-president (commercial amp; marketing), of South City Mall.                
	Playing down the sympathy shutdown, mall officials pointed out that they were mostly brands owned or franchised by the Future Group, which also has a stake in Blue Foods that runs the food court.        
	We had come to shop at Pantaloons but on reaching the store we found it closed. We then moved up to the food court, but even that was shut. We didnt know what was wrong, said shopper Premlata Rungta.        
	Late in the evening, Pantaloons reopened after the AC connection to the outlet was restored following an assurance from B.S. Nagesh of the Shoppers Stop group that he would broker a meeting between the mall management and Biyani to resolve the dues discord in the next 10 days.        
	This could be a fragile peace. Biyanis company has taken the lead to create a forum, now with over 70 member-retailers, to address common grievances at the mall.        
	Our primary demand is that the rent abatement initiative must continue till 2010, since things are still far from rosy, said Gagan Sachdev, owner of fitness equipment store Bodyline.        
	We are all members of the retailers welfare association. The rent is very high and there are several service issues, said Alok Roy of Moustache.         
	Rent row apart, issues on the forums agenda are smooth entry of goods, parking rebate for store owners, improving AC on the third level and transparency in sharing maintenance cost data.        
	The mall management refuted allegations of highhandedness. We have tried to set international standards of services and have only requested all our retailers to adhere to the norms and clear their dues, said Sushil Mohta, a director of South City Projects Ltd.                    (WITH INPUTS FROM POULOMI BANERJEE)

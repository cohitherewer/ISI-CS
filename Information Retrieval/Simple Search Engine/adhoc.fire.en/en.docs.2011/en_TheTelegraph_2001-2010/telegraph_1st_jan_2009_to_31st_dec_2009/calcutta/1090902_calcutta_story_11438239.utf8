The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Four held for bar brawl
                                                                                                               Four held for bar brawl
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Four criminals who allegedly ransacked a bar-cum-restaurant in Howrah around 10pm on Monday after being asked to clear their bill were arrested later in the night.         
	Police said Anik Mukherjee, Ujjal Satra, Tarak Chokdar and Sandip Mallik, associates of local tough Kath Gobinda, were held on the basis of a complaint by the owner of Angan bar, Anindya Ghosh. They were remanded in judicial custody for three days on Tuesday.         
	According to Ghosh, Kath Gobinda and his four associates had run up a bill of Rs 1,080 at the Kadamtala bar but refused to pay up. When my manager Sandip Konar asked them for the payment, they pointed a revolver at him and tried to drag him to their motorcycle, said Ghosh.         
	The owner said the goons wanted to strike a deal with him about not paying at the bar. When he refused, they allegedly threatened him with a gun too.         
	I fled inside the bar and they followed me. They shattered the glass panes in front of the bar and broke glasses, liquor bottles and furniture, said Ghosh. The goons allegedly fired two shots in the air.         
	In the complaint, Ghosh also named three home guards who were earlier posted at the nearby Bantra police station  Santu Guha Niyogi, Binesh Shaw and Debasis Chatterjee.        
	The trio would often eat and drink at my bar for free. But after they were transferred, I refused to give them any more freebies, Ghosh said.         
	He told the police that on Monday evening, a waiter had overheard the goons asking for the home guards help in beating up some people. The home guards allegedly agreed and left before the brawl.         
	The police said a departmental inquiry had been started against the home guards.

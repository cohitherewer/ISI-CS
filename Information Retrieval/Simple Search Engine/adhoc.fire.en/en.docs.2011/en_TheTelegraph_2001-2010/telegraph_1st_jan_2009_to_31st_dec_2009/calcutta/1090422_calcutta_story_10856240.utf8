The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | JU writes exams by candlelight
                                                                                                               JU writes exams by candlelight

	Students turned up for classes in shorts and sleeveless T-shirts on Tuesday as Jadavpur University (JU) went without power for the third consecutive day.        
	One of the six transformers that supply power to the campus stopped functioning on Sunday afternoon, according to the JU authorities.         
	A lead coil inside the transformer got burnt. Power was finally restored late on Tuesday evening, said registrar Pradip Kumar Ghosh.        
	University sources said the delay in repairing the transformer was caused by the unavailability of the lead coil.        
	It took the engineers a long time to identify the fault and then locate a shop selling the lead coil, said a university official.        
	The departments holding internal exams bore the brunt of the problem. Students were forced to write their papers by candlelight.        
	Students said their preparations for the upcoming semester examinations were hampered. Officials said the physics, chemistry, arts, civil engineering and pharmaceutical sciences departments were affected.         
	Our exams begin on April 29, but we couldnt do any laboratory work for the past two days. We may be forced to come for the practical sessions during our exams, said a civil engineering student.        
	Others faced problems at the libraries. We could not use the departmental libraries to prepare for the exams. We could not even photocopy study materials, said Sudipto Halder, a final-year chemistry student.        
	There is no electricity in our classrooms. Its tormenting to sit inside, said Sananda Dasgupta, a postgraduate student of comparative literature.        
	The department was forced to hold classes in the corridor and staircase landings to finish the syllabus before the exams.         
	A number of classes were also suspended on Monday and Tuesday.        
	It is impossible to take classes in this heat and darkness. Even the students are reluctant to attend classes, said a professor, requesting anonymity.        
	Students of the history department, however, got a taste of the Visva-Bharati-style of teaching on Tuesday.        
	Some of our classes were held under the shade of a tree, by the lake. It was pretty refreshing, even in this sweltering heat, said Riya Roy, a second-year student.        
	Even the womens hostel and the canteens went without power.        
	Its over 40 degrees, and we do not even have cold drinks in the canteen to refresh ourselves, said Sanmit Chatterjee, a student.

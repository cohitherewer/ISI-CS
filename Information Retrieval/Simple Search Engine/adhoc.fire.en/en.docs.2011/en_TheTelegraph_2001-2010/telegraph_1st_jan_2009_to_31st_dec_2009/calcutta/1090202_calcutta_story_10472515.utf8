                      Symbolism in nature                    T he paintings of Kazi Ghiyasuddin reinforce the notion that simplicity is the ultimate form of sophistication. The artist originates from Bangladesh but is inspired by Far Eastern ideals, as the major half of his art education had been taken care of in that part of the world. In fact, his visual orientations clearly bear the stamp of a Japanese influence. Ghiyasuddins lyricism reminds us of two great innovators in painting in the 20th century: Wassily Kandinsky and Paul Klee. His works can be considered as a personal documentation of the vibrations that he senses, within and adjoining him. What he does is to strain the vital essence of life and the environment, holding it up and sharing it with his viewers. Following a path of natural abstraction, his paintings of nature reveal interesting insights on the artist and the man. A remarkable facet of his symbolism is the enhanced abstraction of his realistically rooted figures. Nature, the ongoing solo show of his paintings, finds the artist using this technique of abstract art to produce traditional realistic representation.                    Event: An exhibition of paintings by Kazi Ghiyasuddin When: Till February 3; 12 noon - 7 pm Where: Aakriti Art Gallery, 12/3A Hungerford Street, 1st floor

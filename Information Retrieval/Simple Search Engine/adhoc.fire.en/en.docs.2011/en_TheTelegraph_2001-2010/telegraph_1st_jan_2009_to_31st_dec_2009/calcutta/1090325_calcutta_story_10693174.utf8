The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Civic list to preserve ponds
                                                                                                               Civic list to preserve ponds
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                              
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has finally decided to preserve water bodies after allowing more than 50,000 buildings to come up by filling up ponds.        
	The director-general of the CMCs project management unit (PMU), Anindya Karforma, following an order from municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay, has started preparing an authentic list of ponds based on an aerial survey report prepared by the National Remote Sensing Authority and the records available with the civic assessment wing and the block land and land reforms department.        
	The list, likely to be ready in six months and then placed in the Assembly before being published by the CMC, will save citizens harassment while getting building plans sanctioned by the PMU, said an official.        
	Officials said that once the list was approved by the Assembly, the authorities would crack down on anyone attempting a landfill.        
	At the same time, people will not have to seek the PMUs clearance while planning to develop a plot that is not on the pond list.        
	According to the present practice, a building plan submitted to the civic body is sent to the PMU to ascertain the character of the plot.        
	Its a matter of concern that over the past 35 years, more than 10,000 water bodies have been filled by realtors. In the absence of an authentic pond list, the civic authorities in a number of cases had to allow construction on plots that were once ponds, said Bandyopadhyay.        
	Civic records suggest that there were 1,200 ponds in Calcutta in the late-1970s. Around 1,000 have been filled up.        
	The added areas comprising Jadavpur, Behala and Garden Reach had more than 10,000 ponds when they were merged with the CMC. Now, only around 3,000 are left.

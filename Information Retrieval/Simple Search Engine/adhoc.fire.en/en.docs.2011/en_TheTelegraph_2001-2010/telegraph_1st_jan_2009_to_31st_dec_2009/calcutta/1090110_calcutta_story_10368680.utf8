          SOUMITRA DAS                          Viewers at the Studio 21 exhibition titled Subliminal Images that opened on Friday. Picture by Amit Datta                                   
	Only our dreams allow us a glimpse of what lies beyond the threshold of consciousness. Studio 21 at 17L Dover Terrace opened on Friday its exhibition of three youngish artists titled Subliminal Images.        
	Light-hearted and fancy-free, this exhibition is in keeping with Studio 21s agenda of giving young people an opportunity to show off their talent.        
	Nudes having the time of their life appear in Satya Dheer Singhs canvases. He uses light acrylic shades along with a single bright hue like tomato red and ink in his works. Only lines define his images of the nudes in cars or on bicycles, extending an arm as long as the beanstalk of the fairytale or with a hose, one foot resting on the moon. All the exhibits are leavened with this element of fantasy.        
	Gourishankar Sonis works often convey a sense of human beings trying to escape from their predicament as they try to wriggle out of holes punched into a swathe or dabs of paint. Soni paints the tiny figures in dhotis as painstakingly as a miniature artist. On a painted surface shaped like a leaf, the tiny beings play musical instruments, make love or look out of the holes. There is no escape route for these creatures, however hard they may try.        
	Hybrids  perhaps a cross between human beings and the canine species  are what Gauri paints. The creatures he paints have gaping holes for mouths with rows of teeth sticking out like crenellated walls. Reds and blues and lines are his only means of expression.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Consent flurry after code flout
                                                                                                               Consent flurry after code flout
                                          
	Graffiti gangs from all parties are working overtime to dodge prosecution for poll code violation. Many letters of permission are the products of their pressure tactics. Most other consent letters mention only the names of the owners and tenants of the buildings whose walls have been defaced, said police.        
	We have issued over 500 showcause notices for graffiti rule violation and received more than 230 letters of consent. At times, 20-plus letters are being submitted to the police in an hour, said C.R. Das, the returning officer of Calcutta North.        
	Showcause notices were served in more than 150 cases and we received 90-odd letters of permission. In the absence of further specific complaints, we have to close the cases, said a senior electoral official of Calcutta South. Metro toured Calcutta South on Sunday to find most private walls defaced without permission from owners even as letters of manufactured consent piled up in police stations.              
	8/18 Cornfield Road        
	Vote for Mamata Banerjee decorates the wall of the three-storeyed building belonging to Biswanath Basak, 70.        
	No one asked for a written permission and so I gave none, said Basak, who runs a stationery shop on the ground floor. Some Trinamul boys from the para said they wanted to paint graffiti on my wall. What could I say? After all, I will have to continue living here.        
	Trinamul painted Basaks wall on March 15.        
	No permission letter had been submitted to the Gariahat police station till Sunday (March 22) evening.        
	If the Trinamul brigade is here can the CPM battalion be far behind?        
	Some CPM supporters have already booked another part of the Basak wall. We have requested both parties to use only the ground floor walls because we have recently whitewashed the top floors. I hope they will honour the request, said the hapless house-owner.        
	The Basaks who have lived at the Cornfield Road address for 30 years are resigned to living with defaced walls. I have heard that political parties are required to return the walls to their original state after the polls. But I dont know if that will happen, shrugged the septuagenarian.        
	Did he feel wronged? Yes, of course.        
	Would he lodge a formal complaint? No.              
	22 Ballygunge Place East        
	The owner of this three-storeyed building spent Rs 30,000 six months ago on colouring the outer wall with weather guard paint. The look of the ground floor has already been ruined by a Trinamul graffiti exhorting voters to ensure that Mamata Banerjee retains her Parliament seat.         
	The Singhs, tenants in a ground-floor flat, found Mamata Banerjee re-elect written in bold letters below their balcony grille one morning about a week ago.         
	Those who painted the graffiti did not seek the permission of Kawalbir Singh, a businessman whose family shares the flat with that of his elder brother, or the owner, T.K. Walia, a 54-year-old woman who runs a furniture business.        
	This is a gross violation of rights but we have to face this before every election. When there are no elections, parties use my walls to urge people to attend rallies. Sometimes, even apolitical messages are painted on the wall, she said.        
	If there is no way to stop this menace, the authorities should at least ensure that the house-owners are paid for the use of their walls, she added.        
	The trader, who lives in one of the flats in the building with her three children, will not lodge a complaint. My husband lives in Orissa and looks after another business. I do not want the party workers to harass me.         
	The tenants, too, dont want trouble. Kawalbir Singhs son Gurjeet, who studies in Class IX in Army Public School, said: I have been reading the wall graffiti-related stories in The Telegraph and I am aware of my rights as a citizen but I dont think we are going to lodge a complaint.                    OUR BUREAU

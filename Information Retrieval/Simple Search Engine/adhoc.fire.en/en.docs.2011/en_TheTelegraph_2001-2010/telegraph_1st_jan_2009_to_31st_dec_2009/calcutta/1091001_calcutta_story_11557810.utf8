                                                                                                               Tabla whiz who woos Arnie to Zeta-Jones
          MOHUA DAS                          Sandeep Das. (Aranya Sen)                                  
	He found a fan in Steve Jobs after a concert in Stanford, had Arnold Schwarzenegger stepping backstage to congratulate him in China and received a hug from Alec Baldwin after a rehearsal in New York. Tabla player Sandeep Das has been drumming up a storm across the globe but has mostly kept away from the public eye in his home country.         
	The Delhi-based Bengali  fresh from a concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London where he was invited to perform by Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas  was in town on Wednesday to accompany Ayaan Ali Khan for a puja concert. The couple had heard me play at the Hollywood Bowl as a part of Silk Road and invited us for the BBC Proms in 2004 and again this year, he said.        
	Born and raised in Patna and trained in Varanasi under Pandit Kishan Maharaj, the 39-year-old has carved his own space as a soloist and member of the Silk Road Ensemble started by Yo-Yo Ma, a cellist and multiple Grammy winner. It is because of my guruji that I got to perform with senior classical musicians like Ravi Shankar and Girija Devi by the time I was 15, said Sandeep.         
	After topping his English literature class at Benaras Hindu University, Sandeep started his musical journey in Delhi. Accompanying Shubha Mudgal, Viji Jog, Amjad Ali Khan and Pandit Shiv Kumar Sharma and travelling with Yo-Yo Ma took him to major music centres across continents.         
	Sandeep has over 30 collaborative albums to his credit, including a Grammy nomination in 2005 for an album by the group Ghazal titled The Rain.         
	The tabla whiz is looking forward to starting his own quartet called the HUM Ensemble in India that will include a Spanish bagpiper, a Chinese singer and two Broadway percussionists along with musicians from across India.         
	HUM stands for harmony and universality through music. I plan to start with Delhi, followed by Patna. Id like to bring it to Calcutta too, since its the most cultural of all cities, he said.

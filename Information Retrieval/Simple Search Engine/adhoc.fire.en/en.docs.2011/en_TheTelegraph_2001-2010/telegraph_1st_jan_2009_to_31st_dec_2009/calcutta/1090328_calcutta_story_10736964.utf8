                      Reflections on life                    A mere toddler when she first came to Santiniketan with her parents, Chandana Hores association with colours began from her early childhood. A student of Patha Bhavan and an avid reader of poetry, her canvases often include lines from self-composed poems. Experiences of her own life, such as the illnesses of her parents, find expression in her canvases through the recurrence of themes of death and suffering. Nevertheless, her works have a wonderful equation with femininity. Her attitude towards it is not in-your-face, neither does it take the shape of a protest or a bare, simple documentation. Her works are a cry against the social pressures of being a woman, but at the same time they celebrate the womans body and womanhood. At the ongoing show of her recent works in watercolour and acrylic on canvas, Hore focuses her skills on articulating universal truths about the eternal cycle of life. A consciousness of the passing of youth and coming of old age and death marks most of her works. Conversely, while youth is associated with betrayal, confusion and loneliness, old age brings with it calmness, maturity and spirituality. Hosted by The Seagull Foundation for the Arts.                    Event: An exhibition of paintings by Chandana Hore When: Till April 4; 2 pm - 8 pm Where: Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre, 36 C S.P. Mukherjee Road

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Last lap showers narrow deficit
                                                                                                               Last lap showers narrow deficit
  - First week accounts for more than half of Septembers rain average          A STAFF REPORTER                                                  
	A September surge in showers has brought down the citys rainfall deficit from 18 per cent a month ago to less than 4 per cent.        
	The gap may narrow further with the Met office predicting steady rain throughout the festive month.        
	The heavy rainfall over the last weekend, triggered by a deep depression, has brought the deficit down drastically, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.        
	The city received more than 156.5mm of rain in 72 hours, between Friday and Sunday.        
	Calcuttas rainfall deficit is down from around 18 per cent on August 7 to 3.86 per cent on Monday. Deficit till 19 per cent is considered normal in meteorology. So it can be said that the city has already received its normal quota of rainfall, said Debnath.        
	The monsoon activity had picked up from the second half of August but the real clincher, as a weather official said, was the first week of this month which recorded over 159.3mm of rain, or 53.8 per cent of the average rainfall of entire September.        
	The first week of September has been very encouraging. If the trend holds, there might be no deficit in the monsoon rain in the city as well as the rest of the state, Debnath told Metro.        
	Since the onset of the monsoon till Monday, the city has received 995mm of rain against the average projection of 1,035mm. The shortfall, meteorologists say, is not alarming considering the severely deficient rain in June and the fact that monsoon usually remains active in the state till the first week of October.        
	The city was badly hit in June, when it received 130mm of rain against the average of 259.9mm. The deficit was so vast that even 360.7mm of rainfall in July  higher than the average 331.8mm  was not enough, said a senior meteorologist working for a private agency.         
	But decent showers in August (269.2mm) and the first week of September have bridged the gap.        
	The deep depression that brought heavy rain in south Bengal over the weekend has considerably weakened and moved westward. At 8.30am on Monday, it lay to the west of Daltonganj in Jharkhand.        
	The monsoon, powered by Cyclone Aila, had arrived early in the state on May 25. Though the city received around 100mm of rain within the first 24 hours, the activation of the normal monsoon flow took another 30 days.        
	The city experienced 7.5mm of rainfall on Monday as the mercury touched a maximum of 29.8 degrees Celsius, two degrees below normal. The weatherman predicted that Tuesday would be generally cloudy with one or two spells of rain or thundershower.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Here comes the bug
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Here comes the bug
  - Price no bar for Beetlemania          ANASUYA BASU                                                        
	The bug will be here by the year-end and at least 10 Calcuttans will be in the driving seat by the first quarter of 2010.        
	The iconic Beetle, the original peoples car that has sold over 20 million units worldwide, is being launched in its modern avatar in Mumbai on Friday by Volkswagen. The New Beetle should be available in Calcutta around Christmas at the new company showroom on the EM Bypass near Salt Lake stadium.        
	The price point for the bug-shaped car is under wraps but industry insiders are looking at Rs 19 to 22 lakh.        
	Ten Calcuttans have already proved that price is no bar when it comes to Beetlemania.        
	Sources at OSL Exclusive, the sole Volkswagen dealer in the city, told Metro: The response to the Beetle in Calcutta is big. The 10 advance bookings we have had so far are from people who are willing to shell out anything to own a Beetle. They have deposited the booking amount and are willing to pay up the balance once the price is announced on Friday.        
	And what is the profile of the I-want-it-at-any-cost customer in Calcutta? These are people who are multiple car owners and for them the Beetle will be a prized possession, said the source.        
	The car available in India as a Complete Built Up (CBU) unit will be imported from Mexico and so will attract a 110 per cent import duty that will push up the price.        
	It is four times more expensive than Polo, the small car that is being manufactured at our Pune plant, said Neeraj Garg, the Volkswagen passenger car director.        
	The consignment of cars coming to India is expected in the next two-three days and that is when allocations for Calcutta will happen.        
	If someone books a New Beetle today, he is assured of delivery by March or April 2010, said the dealer source.        
	More than performance, this two-door traffic-stopper is powered by its distinctive bug shape and history. The original was voted the worlds most influential car of the 20th century after the Ford Model T, the Mini and the Citron 2CV.        
	What the Model T is to Ford, the Beetle is to Volkswagen, said Deborshi Sadhan Bose, who has a vintage Model T in his Ballygunge stable.

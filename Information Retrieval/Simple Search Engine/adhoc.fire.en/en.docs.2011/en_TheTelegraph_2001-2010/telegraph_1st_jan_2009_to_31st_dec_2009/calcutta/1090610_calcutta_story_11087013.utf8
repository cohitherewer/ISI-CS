The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sleep comes with tears for flu suspect
                                                                                                               Sleep comes with tears for flu suspect
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The only advantage Kalyani homemaker Sutapa Bhattacharya has over Toronto resident Sushmita Biswas is a clean bed sheet.        
	Sutapa, quarantined for suspected swine flu after returning from a holiday in Singapore with fever, cried herself to sleep on that bed sheet on Monday night after being forcibly brought back to the hospital she had walked out of around 44 hours earlier.        
	The isolation ward of the Infectious Diseases Hospital in Beleghata was infested with mosquitoes. When she complained, the hospital staff got her a repellent but that didnt really help. Fortunately, she had carried a bed sheet along, Swapan Chakraborty, an uncle who had accompanied Sutapa to the hospital, told Metro on Tuesday.         
	The 46-year-old homemaker refused the allegedly unpalatable food served at the hospital and also did not use the toilet because it was dirty. It was only in the morning that the nursing staff forced a Group D employee to clean the toilet, a family member said.        
	The result of Sutapas swine-flu test is unlikely to be known before 48 hours, which means she has to spend at least another two nights at the hospital. Throat and nasal swabs drawn from her were sent to the National Institute of Communicable Diseases in New Delhi on Tuesday, a doctor said.        
	NRI Sushmita and her toddler, Gibson, went through the same experience last month when they were isolated in a dirty male ward of the Beleghata hospital for three nights.        
	The mother and son had landed in Calcutta with cough and fever, which officials suspected to be symptoms of swine flu. Both tested negative.        
	Sutapa, who had walked out of the hospital early on Sunday because she was allegedly not even examined properly, claimed on Tuesday that she was brought back with a false promise.        
	 One of the officials who came to take her back to the hospital had promised to release her on Tuesday morning after taking throat and nasal swabs. Sutapa was shocked when a doctor told her that she would have to stay till the test result came, a relative said.         
	An angry Sutapa demanded that she be allowed to see the official who allegedly made that false promise.        
	She is distraught. I gave her a book to read as there is nothing else to do there. She has been crying continuously, said uncle Chakraborty.        
	It was very difficult to console her. She kept saying that she was being quarantined without any reason, he added.

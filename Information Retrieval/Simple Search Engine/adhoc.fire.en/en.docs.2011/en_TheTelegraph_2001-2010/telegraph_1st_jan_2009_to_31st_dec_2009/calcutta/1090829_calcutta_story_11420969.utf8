	The railway experts committee will try to boost the ministrys revenue using information communication and technology (ICT), Sam Pitroda, who will head the panel, said on Friday.        
	The committee will be set up and programmes framed within a few days, said Pitroda, who was in the city to address an interactive session organised by the American Chamber of Commerce in India.        
	He suggested that the vast optical fibre cable network of the railway, virtually lying unused for a decade, could be leased out to the Prime Ministers national knowledge network and also private parties.        
	The panel, Pitroda added, would draft policies on using ICT for generating more revenue from non-core assets. of the railway. The ICT could also be used to create web-based data bank of railway vendors and seamless rail, air and bus tickets.        
	Speaking on the occasion, the Union minister of state for health, Dinesh Trivedi, said he would meet Nandan Nilekani, the chairman of the Unique Identification Authority of India, on September 8 to finalise policies on the e-health card for all newborns. The card will contain all data of the child, including the vaccination schedule.

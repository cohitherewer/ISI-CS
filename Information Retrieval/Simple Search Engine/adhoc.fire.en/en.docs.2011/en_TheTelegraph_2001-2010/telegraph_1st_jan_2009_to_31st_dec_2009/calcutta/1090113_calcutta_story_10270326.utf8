The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Showpiece in a shambles
                                                                                                               Showpiece in a shambles
                                        
	The road to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees showpiece tech town is in a mess. After Metro reported on the poor condition of Sector V thoroughfares in September, the authorities did some patchwork. But the top layer has peeled off yet again and the potholes have returned. To add to motorists woes, many street lights do not function. Metro takes a look at the problem points.    
	Hazardous roads              
	The bituminous flanks of the road are pockmarked with craters and potholes. The surface has peeled off in patches between College More and Technopolis.        
	The road is at its worst at the Videocon crossing, in front of Brainware Computer Academy and the second Wipro gate and near the PTI building. Building materials like sand and stone chips are heaped on the roadside. In many spots, the materials spill over on the carriageway.        
	In November last year, a bus had skidded on stone chips in front of Nicco Park, injuring around 20 passengers.        
	The fog and the potholed road make driving very difficult in the morning. I fear I may meet with an accident any time. I had a lucky escape a few days back, said Goutam Sarkar, the driver of a pool car ferrying Wipro employees.              
	Illegal parking              
	A major part of the tech hub is devoid of footpaths. And where they exist, they have been taken over by eateries. With vehicles parked illegally along both sides of the carriageways, pedestrians have no choice but to walk dangerously close to vehicles.        
	Last week, I was almost run over by a speeding car. I admit I was walking down the main carriageway, but I had to option as the sidewalks and the edges of the road were encroached upon, said Saptami Chakraborty, a first year student of ICFAI.              
	Street lights              
	A number of street lights between the SDF building and Technopolis either do not function or are damaged. The worst-hit are the arterial roads, especially the stretch along Webel Bhavan, TCS and the Infinity building, where a number of IT companies are located.        
	The place becomes scary after dusk. With no streetlights, we feel insecure while walking down the road in the evening, said Anindita Sen, an employee of a call centre located on the stretch.              
	Lack of policing              
	At most places, the traffic signals have been set in the automatic mode and the cops are missing in action. Empty traffic kiosks and unmanned traffic signals are a common sight at the Webel crossing, College More and the crossing near Technopolis.        
	Last week my car was dashed from the side by another vehicle that had jumped a signal. But no policeman was in sight to take action against the offending driver and he escaped, said Sandeep Choudhry, a resident of New Town.        
	Officialspeak: We have just started repairing the stretch and hope to complete it by the month-end. I have asked the new contractor to ensure that the building materials dont spill on the road, said S.A. Ahmed, the chairman of the Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority, which looks after the administrative affairs of Sector V.        
	I have also asked him to put up signboards wherever sand or stone chips are dumped, to prevent accidents.        
	Ahmed added that street lights on the stretch are being inspected and those found out-of-order are being repaired. We also plan to send a status report to the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority.

          SEBANTI SARKAR                                            
	After seeing yesterdays film Wild Chicks, I realised that my brother had to catch this film festival, exclaimed nine-year-old Sumangalam Choudhury. Said his five-year-old sibling, Triviram, a student of Lakshmipat Singhania Academy: I came for Emil and the Detectives. The story was part of my syllabus in school.         
	The two were at Max Mueller Bhavans German Youth Festival, held from December 1 to 4 as a part of the Schools: Partners for the Future initiative. Supported by the federal foreign office of Germany, the initiative is designed to promote interest in the German language and culture. Four of initiatives 41 partner schools in India are from Calcutta.         
	The festival offerings, underlining the theme, One for all and all for one, included four films, subtitled in English.                   Students perform at St Johns Diocesan Schools Christmas programme to celebrate the fifth year of a school for slum children run by the institution in Bedford Lane. Other items for the day included a Nativity play and a performance by the school choir. Picture by Anindya Shankar Ray      
	Emil , directed by Franziska Buch, was about a young boy from a small Baltic town who takes the help of a bunch of street-smart homeless kids to catch a thief who robs him. Though wanting in technique, its insights on life in an urban setting resonated with the young audience.         
	Wild Soccer Bunch was about a group of six-year olds kicking up a ruckus about soccer during summer vacation, while Flying Classroom (picture left) showed the unexpected results of an amateur theatre production by students of the Thomaner boarding school. Wild Chicks saw two young gangs  Pygmies (boys) and Wild Chicks (girls) locking horns.         
	The festival saw enthusiastic youngsters, with parents or in groups of threes and fours, backpacks, water bottles, caps and grins in place, filling the Max Mueller premises. Schools like Lakshmipat Singhania, Birla High for Boys, Modern High for Girls, La Martiniere for Girls, Loreto Sealdah, BD Memorial and The Heritage sent over 200 students for the morning and afternoon shows.         
	My daughter loves watching films. I wish we had a permanent theatre for childrens films, said Sumana Chakraborty, who had come to drop her daughter off.

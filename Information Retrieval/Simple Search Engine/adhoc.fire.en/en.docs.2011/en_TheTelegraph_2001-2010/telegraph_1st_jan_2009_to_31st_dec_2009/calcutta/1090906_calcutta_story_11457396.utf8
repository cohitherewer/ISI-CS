The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Eco hurdles for hub 
                                                                                                               Eco hurdles for hub 
                              The site of the proposed petrochemical hub at Nayachar                            
	The proposed petrochemical hub at Nayachar may hit the climate hurdle.        
	Recently during a meeting on climate change in Delhi, the issue of giving environmental clearance to the project was raised. Union environment and forest minister Jayram Ramesh minister dropped broad hints on the climatic vulnerability of the project.         
	We have decided to discontinue the practice of giving in principle approvals and henceforth will only give actual approvals or reject projects, the minister said. So far the practice was to obtain an in principle approval for big projects like Nayachar with some stated conditions, after which getting the actual clearance was only a formality.         
	If the minister was evasive on a project which is something of a political hot potato  the flagship project of the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government has clearance from central government departments other than environment but is opposed by the Congresss biggest ally Trinamul Congress  his officials were more forthright.        
	Where is the project? Nothing has been on the table in the environment department, J.M. Mauskar, additional secretary, ministry of environment and forest told Metro.         
	The proposed site of the petrochemical hub is only a few km from the Sunderbans, a region already identified as most vulnerable to climatic changes.         
	Keeping in view the threat of global warming and the probable rise of sea level by the end of this century as apprehended in the 4th assessment report of IPCC, Nayachar is a vulnerable site for any so-called developmental work, said river expert Kalyan Rudra.         
	The Bay of Bengal is an area favourable for cyclo-genesis. The 20th century witnessed 94 cyclones in the area, out of which seven were devastating in nature and if a prediction comes true, the entire coastal tract will be marooned few decades from now. Any project on coastal areas should take into account these forthcoming changes, added Rudra.        
	However, some experts differ. We do not think the sea level rise will be a threat to the proposed Nayachar hub and adequate precautions will be taken to climate-proof the project from climatic vagaries, including the tropical cyclones, said Siddhartha Dutta of Jadavpur University, a key member of the state-formed committee to assess the feasibility of the project.         
	The state government remains tense on the environmental clearance. We briefed the chief minister on the progress with regard to the Nayachar project. We are in close touch with Delhi as the clearance is a must, said an official of the chief ministers secretariat.                     JAYANTA BASU

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Return of hot wind amp; power cut 
                                                                                                               Return of hot wind amp; power cut 
          OUR BUREAU                              
	A weak monsoon, hot wind from central India and power cuts made the city sweat on Tuesday.        
	The weatherman said the conditions would not improve in the next 24 hours. CESC, however, held out hope for uninterrupted power supply on Wednesday.        
	There was no rain on Tuesday since the monsoon current has become weak, while a shift in the wind pattern had brought dry hot wind from central India into Gangetic Bengal, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the weather section at the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.         
	The maximum temperature on Tuesday was 37.9 degree Celsius, three degrees above normal and four degrees more than Mondays highest. The discomfort index was 66 degree Celsius, 11 degrees above normal.        
	Rain is not expected in the city before Thursday, said the weatherman.        
	Power cuts of one-and-a-half to two hours in several pockets on Tuesday added to the discomfort.        
	CESC claimed it was caught off guard by the sudden increase in demand triggered by the return of sultry days.        
	Power plants temporarily shut down in view of the low demand last week are being made operational again to bolster supply, said an official of the power utility.        
	The shortfall on Tuesday evening was 151MW, bringing around 150 residents of Burrabazar out on the road. They blocked Jadulal Mullick Road at Malapara for 40 minutes demanding restoration of power supply.         
	There is no power in our locality since 1pm. CESC men did not turn up despite repeated complaints. Long power cuts have become a daily affair at Burrabazar, especially in the market area, said Harcharan Tiwari, a resident of the area who took part in the blockade.        
	There were blockades also at Cossipore and on Dum Dum Road to protest prolonged power cuts.

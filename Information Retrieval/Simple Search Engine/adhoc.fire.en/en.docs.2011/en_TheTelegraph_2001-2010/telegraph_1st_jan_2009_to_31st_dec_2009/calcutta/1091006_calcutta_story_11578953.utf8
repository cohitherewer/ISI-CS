The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Proposal to change court name
                                                                                                               Proposal to change court name
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The Centre has proposed that Calcutta High Courts name be changed to Kolkata High Court, according to sources at Writers Buildings.         
	The law ministry had sent the proposal to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, said a Writers official.        
	According to norms, a high court must approve a change in its name. Hence, the proposal has to be forwarded to the high court authorities if the government agrees to the proposal, added a source.         
	As the court is on vacation and the chief justice is out of station, a decision on the proposal cannot be taken right now, a high court official told Metro.         
	The sources added that the Centre had also proposed that the names of Bombay High Court and Madras High Court be changed to Mumbai High Court and Chennai High Court, respectively.         
	The state governments have not been set a deadline to change the names, said a source.         
	In all three states, the governments have renamed their agencies according to the new names of the capital. For example, in Bengal, the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority has become the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority.        
	Welcoming the Centres move, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, who is also a senior advocate of the high court, said: It is good decision. Since Calcutta is now known as Kolkata, the name of the high court should also change.        
	Calcutta High Court is the oldest high court in the country. It was set up in 1862 and was once the countrys apex court.

                                                                                                               Bikers rob Rs 2 lakh
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Two motorcycle-borne youths snatched away at gunpoint a bag containing Rs 2 lakh from a man at Fariapukur, near Shyambazar, on Monday.        
	Rana Das, 22, withdrew the amount from his employers account in a private bank around 1.45pm and was walking down APC Roy Road when the duo came from behind, grabbed the bag and sped away. We are yet to find anyone who had heard Das scream, said a cop.

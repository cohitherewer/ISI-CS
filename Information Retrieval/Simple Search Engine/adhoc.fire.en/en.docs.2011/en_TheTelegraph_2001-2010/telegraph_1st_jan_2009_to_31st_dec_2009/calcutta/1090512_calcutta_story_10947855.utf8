                      Sculpture as sensibility objectified                    Trained in an art school founded for fostering the academic tradition of figurative sculpture, Sarbari Roy Chowdhury was also among the first of the moderns who expressed through a formal intuition of energies other than anatomical. His works over the decades are a positive assertion of his freedom from his academic training. The principal subject matter of his sculptures is the female figure. The male figure has little place in his imagination and enters his work only as a partner. Looking at his work chronologically, it is clear that the thematic unity of his oeuvre is stronger and more significant than the stylistic shifts within it. The ongoing retrospective show of his works bears testimony to the truth that the female figure is the object of gaze and imagination of the sculptor, on which he enacts his sensations. In his works, the torso is the body, not a part but a complete object into which the female body is condensed. His later works show that his subject is not the female form but female sensuality. They evoke the awesome energy of female sexuality and acknowledge that the female body is both yielding and challenging. Yet, his final works fight down this aspect of female power with post-cubist abstract expressionism.                  Event: An exhibition of sculptures by Sarbari Roy Chowdhury When: Till May 22 (except Sunday); 2 pm - 7 pm Where: Akar Prakar, P 238 Hindustan Park,

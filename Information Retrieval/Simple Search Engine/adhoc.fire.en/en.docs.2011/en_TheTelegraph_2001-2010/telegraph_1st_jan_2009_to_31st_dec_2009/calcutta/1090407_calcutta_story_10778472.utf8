The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CMC sewage work disrupts traffic 
                                                                                                               CMC sewage work disrupts traffic 
          TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                          A flank of the Rashbehari connector has been closed for sewage work leading to snarls. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                  
	A sewage project in front of Bosepukur Sitalamandir has been causing traffic snarls along the Rashbehari connector almost every day over the past month.         
	The five-minute drive from Bijon Setu till the Ruby crossing now takes me 30 to 45 minutes. I will use the Park Circus connector from Tuesday, said Partha Sarathi Gupta, who works in a Sector V company.         
	The sewer line is being laid from the Kasba end of Bijon Setu till the pumping station of the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project on the other side. The left lane of the road leading to the EM Bypass from Rashbehari connector has been closed from the Kasba canal till the Bosepukur bus stop.         
	Evenings on weekdays are particularly bad, with thousands of commuters caught in snarls between Ballygunge Bijon Setu and the Ruby connector on the EM Bypass.         
	This stretch is impossible to manage. The four-point connector and the rickshaw and auto stands at the Bosepukur Sitalamandir crossing have compounded the problem, said a traffic constable.        
	A senior official of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) said the onus was on the police to avoid chaos on the road. Work was long overdue. There is no sewer line in the area, which is why it gets flooded every monsoon. A 900-metre sewer line will solve the problem and that is exactly what we are laying. Till the project is complete, it is the polices job to handle the traffic problems.        
	Buses and autorickshaws are being diverted through the lanes of Bosepukur to minimise snarls in the evening, leaving residents annoyed. Sound pollution in our locality has increased manifold. Vehicles ply till late in the night, disturbing our sleep, said Riya Chakraborty, a resident of Bosepukur Road.        
	Such a project usually takes around a year to be completed. We expect monsoon to disrupt work but we will try to wrap up everything before Puja, said Amit Roy, the chief engineer of the drainage and sewerage department.        
	Auto operators have increased the fare for a ride from Ballygunge to Bosepukur by a rupee  from Rs 4 to Rs 5  because of route diversions. We have been driving through interior lanes to avoid traffic snarls, burning more fuel in the bargain. The fare will be reduced once the main road is cleared, said Santu Jana, an auto driver.

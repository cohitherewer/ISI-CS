                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Peoples voice alive amid antics of democracy

	The voice of the people is lost in the antics of democracy where democracy is by the people, of the people but for some people, said Suman Mukherjee, the director of JD Birla Institute.         
	He was speaking for the motion at the Jacobeans/ Xaverians debate and annual reunion dinner, presented by the St James School Alumni Association in association with The Telegraph.         
	The debate saw noted alumni of St Xaviers College and St James engaging in a war of words on the subject, The voice of the people is a myth in our democracy on December 12.         
	St Xaviers was represented by sports commentator Kishore Bhimani, film director Ashok Vishwanathan and Arjun Daga, a BSc BBM student at Singapore Management University, while Shashank Shah, a political science student at Jadavpur University and Kunwar Chatrath, a lawyer represented St James.         
	Mukherjee stressed that after 62 years of independence, a significant section of the population remains below the poverty line. Democracy is no more about voting, but the counting of votes, he said.         
	Daga spoke of the reading down of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code as an instance when the voice of the minority lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered community was heard against the majority opinion. Similarly, the reopening of the Jessica Lal murder case was an instance when a lost voice was found, he added.         
	Bhimani disagreed, saying that the voice of the media, whose pressure helped reopen the case, could not be equated with that of the people.         
	Shashank felt that the regime change in Bengal was the strongest example of the voice of the people influencing democracy.         
	In recent times, the Right to Information Act and the complete disclosure of judges assets were prompted by the peoples voice, he said.         
	Noting that India is still plagued by lack of education, he added that the voice of the common man mattered not because he had education, but because he had a conscience.        
	While the crowd decided against the motion, the panel of three judges including Mukta Nain, the principal of Birla High School (Boys), Terence Ireland, the principal of St James School and Marcus Roderick, the president of St James School Alumni Association gave the verdict in favour of the motion.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | College boy kills himself
                                                                                                               College boy kills himself
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A second-year college student committed suicide at his home in Sonarpur on Sunday night, with police suspecting a failed affair to be the reason.        
	Abhishek Das, 19, was a commerce student of Dinabandhu Andrews College in Garia. His father Pulak works in a private company.        
	A preliminary investigation suggests that the boy was having an affair with a girl in his neighbourhood on the southern fringes of the city. They probably studied in the same coaching centre in their locality. But his family was not aware of the affair, said an officer.        
	On Sunday, Abhishek left home in the evening for the coaching centre. He returned around 9.30pm and went straight to his room.        
	His family became suspicious when Abhisheks cellphone kept ringing. His aunt peeped into his bedroom and saw him hanging from the ceiling, the officer said. The body has been sent for post-mortem.         
	The police said they were trying to contact the girl with whom Abhishek was believed to be having an affair.        
	We will talk to his friends and family members to ascertain the cause of the death, said Ajey Ranade, the superintendent of South 24-Parganas police.        
	Two other suicides were reported in the city on Monday. Sunil Das, in his mid-40s, was found hanging at his Kalighat Road home in the morning. Family members saw him hanging with a scarf around his neck. A probe revealed Das had been suffering from a financial crisis. A domestic help, Sabita Mistry, 42, was found hanging in the bathroom of the Gurusaday Road flat of her employer, Prem Bagri, on Monday morning.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A surgery was conducted on Sunday morning on the 15-year-old help, who was allegedly tortured by her employers in their Alipore home last week, to remove the blood clots on her back.        
	Manjari Nayek is a little better after the surgery. She was suffering from haematoma and is extremely anaemic, which is the main reason why her wounds are taking so long to heal. She has been given two units of blood since Friday, said a doctor.        
	The girl was found outside the generator room of a government housing estate on New Road in Alipore after she escaped from her employer Shree Prakash Mishras flat on Friday. Shree Prakash, an RBI official, and his wife Madhuri allegedly tortured the minor and confined her in a room without food for two days.

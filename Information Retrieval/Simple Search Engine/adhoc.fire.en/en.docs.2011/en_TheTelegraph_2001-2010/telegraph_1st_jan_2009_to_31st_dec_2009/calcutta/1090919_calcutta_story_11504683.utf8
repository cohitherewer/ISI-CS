The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Potato is party pooper
                                                                                                               Potato is party pooper
  - Govt strategy to arrest hike makes little headway          DEEPANKAR GANGULY AND ZEESHAN JAWED                                    
	Swatilekha Roy bought potatoes last Puja at Rs 8 a kg. A year later, she is shelling out Rs 20.        
	I never expected potato prices to shoot up like this, throwing our family budget haywire in the festive season, the 37-year-old homemaker said. The family of four consumes around 4kg of potato every week, with potato being used in everything, from khichudi to mangsher jhol.        
	On Thursday, notun aloo (fresh harvest) was selling at Rs 30 a kg and the other varieties at Rs 20-22 a kg. At retail outlets such as Spencers and Food Bazaar, the other varieties were selling at Rs 23.        
	Near Maniktala Market on Friday morning, two Home Guards and a volunteer were helping West Bengal Essential Commodities Supply Corporation officials sell potatoes at Rs 13 per kg. Over 150 people had queued up for a 2kg packet each at 8am.        
	But there are many who are not enthused by the government offer. At least 400g from a pack of 2kg will invariably be rotten. They wont even let you choose the potatoes, grumbled a homemaker in Hatibagan.        
	Alarmed by the rise in potato prices from June, the state government has been buying stocks from cold stores and selling them in the open market at Rs 13 a kg since July 13.        
	The move is aimed at stabilising the price by bridging the gap between demand and supply, said an official of the corporation.        
	But the prices are yet to stabilise  in fact another hike is on the cards before Puja and Id  with the government being able to sell only around 400 tonnes till now against the citys daily demand of 3,000.        
	If the homemakers are stretching their budget, experts are punching holes in the governments strategy.        
	Satyabrata Mukherjee, the president of the West Bengal Cold Chain and Cold Storage Owners Welfare Association, said: The government knew that a poor harvest would push up prices. We had warned them as early as March but officials had been sitting on the report. Had they bought potatoes from Punjab (which had a good crop this year), the government would not have to give this subsidy. The price hike cannot be arrested by selling potatoes at Rs 13 a kg because the demand is too high compared with the supply.        
	The governments supply is too low to bridge the gap. The states yield has been 55 lakh tonnes against 88 lakh tonnes last year. The annual consumption is 48 lakh tonnes; 5 lakh tonnes have to be kept aside for seeds, said agricultural marketing minister Mortaza Hossain. Some people are hoarding, he admitted, and getting away with it as there is no law for a crackdown.

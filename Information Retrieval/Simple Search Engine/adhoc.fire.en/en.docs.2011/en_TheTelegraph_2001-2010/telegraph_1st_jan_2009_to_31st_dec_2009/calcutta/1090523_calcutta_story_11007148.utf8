The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Teen shouts away raiders
                                                                                                               Teen shouts away raiders
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Nirali with mother Nita Ramani. (Aranya Sen)                                  
	A 13-year-old girl took a gamble against an armed robber and screamed her lungs out till he and his accomplice panicked and fled her Kalighat flat on Friday afternoon.        
	Nirali Ramani, a Class VIII student, said she was afraid that the armed man might shoot but decided to stand her ground on realising that he was jittery, too.        
	The man was first holding his gun to my mothers head. He pointed it towards me when I continued screaming. As my mother ran towards the main door to press the emergency alarm, the robber and his accomplice ran out, the teenager told Metro.        
	By the time the duo reached the ground floor, where two other men were waiting for them, the buildings caretaker Anil Das and neighbour Chintan Domadia were hot on their heels. Domadia grabbed the armed man from behind while Das snatched the revolver from his hand. The other three fled.        
	The incident occurred around 1.30pm, when Nirali and mother Nita, 37, were in their 1,700sq ft second-floor flat at 331 Kalidas Patitunda Lane. I opened the door when the bell rang and found two men standing there. They identified themselves as delivery agents of a courier company and said there was a consignment for my father, Nirali said.        
	The duo barged into the flat before the teenager could ask them for the packet. One of them took out a revolver and held it to my mothers head. He asked her to hand over the keys to the cupboard, said Nirali, who admitted to being really scared at the sight of the revolver.        
	As the teenager started shouting chorchor, the armed man threatened to shoot. Nita remained quiet but Nirali wouldnt stop shouting.        
	The robbers apparently beat a hasty retreat after the emergency alarm rang out across the three-storeyed building. They bolted out of the door and headed for the staircase, Nirali said.         
	Residents of the building alerted Kalighat police station and handed over the armed robber who was caught. Niralis businessman father Nilesh, 45, arrived soon after receiving a call from his daughter.        
	Nita said her daughters courage saved the day. She had the presence of mind to tackle the emergency. Both of us are safe because of her.         
	A neighbour said it was shocking that criminals could enter a building in such a busy area. Hats off to the brave girl, he added.

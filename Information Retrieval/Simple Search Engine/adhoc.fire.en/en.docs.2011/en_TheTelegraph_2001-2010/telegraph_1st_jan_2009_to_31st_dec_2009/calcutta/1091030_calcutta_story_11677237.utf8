                      An evening of laughter and mirth                    Until surrealism made a deliberate raid on the unconscious, poetry that aimed at being nonsense, apart from the meaningless refrains of songs, does not seem to have been common. This gives a special position to Edward Lear who was one of the first writers to deal in pure fantasy. His poems express a kind of amiable lunacy, a natural sympathy with whatever is weak and absurd. Lear could fairly be called the originator of the limerick...        Sukumar Ray was Indias answer to Edward Lear and Lewis Carroll, and can safely be called their predecessor. A prodigy with multi-faceted talent, Ray has been an integral part of the world of children ever since he started writing. He was the man behind the birth of nonsense verse in India. His poems, with their amazing and simple humour, have delighted Bengalis for generations, transporting them to a delightful world of fantasy. Some of the expressions he coined, like Huko Mukho Hyangla, Ramgarurer Chhana and Kumropatash, have become part of the Bengali vocabulary ever since they appeared in print. In fact, he enriched Bengali literature, specially childrens literature, with his very own brand of humour. We are indeed indebted to Ray for giving us the courage and confidence to throw all cautions to wind and laugh without any inhibitions at a time when Huko Mukho Hyangla and Ramgarurer Chhana are ruling the roost. On the occasion of Rays 122nd birth anniversary, Mahul recitation band, in association with Weavers Studio Centre for the Arts, hosts a programme today. The first part (3 pm - 5 pm) will feature an exhibition on Ray and in the second half (5 pm - 7 pm) members of Mahul will present a programme of recitation.                    Event: An exhibition to celebrate Sukumar Rays 122nd birth anniversary, to be followed by a performance by Mahul recitation band When: Today, 3 pm onwards Where: Weavers Studio Centre for the Arts, 94 Ballygunge Place

                                                                                                               Seven hurt in Howrah blaze
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Seven persons, including five members of a family, were severely burnt after a fire broke out in a one-storey house in Salkia on Friday night.        
	The flames, fanned by the evening breeze, spread to two adjacent houses. The residents escaped unhurt but both houses were partially damaged.        
	Police said the fire originated in the kitchen of the single-storey house where a gas cylinder had exploded. The entire building was engulfed in flames within seconds. Four tenders took an hour and a half to bring the blaze under control.        
	Among those injured were Purna Lahiri, wife Pali, sister Debolina, brother Prabir and sister-in-law Chaitali. Two youths  Lalu Santra and Gautam Pal  who entered the house to rescue the family also suffered burns.        
	The condition of all seven was critical. They have been admitted to Howrah district hospital, an officer of Malipanchghara police station said.        
	A preliminary probe revealed the fire broke out after the safety valve of the cylinder gave away. The fire spread quickly to the other parts of the house because of the huge quantity of kerosene the family had stored in containers, the officer added.        
	It was chaos all over as people started fleeing home. We had to disconnect power supply to ensure the fire did not spread further, said another officer.        
	nExchange blaze: A fire broke out in the telephone exchange on Pretoria Street on Friday afternoon. Two tenders took more than an hour to bring the blaze under control. No one was injured.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two persons were arrested in Baranagar on Thursday for duping a nationalised bank of around Rs 4 crore on the pretext of opening a food court near the site in Singur where Tata Motors was supposed to set up its Nano factory.        
	Gautam Pal and Sabyasachi Pal opened 39 accounts using fictitious names and forged documents to take loans from Bank of Indias NS Road branch in BBD Bag. The bank authorities lodged a complaint with the CBI after the duo defaulted in paying the equated monthly instalments.        
	The two have been remanded in CBI custody till March 3.        
	Passbooks of all 39 accounts were seized from Gautams residence, said an officer. We are yet to find out what became of the money and if the duo had purchased land in Singur. We are also trying to find out if any bank employee was involved.        
	Cop signature forged: Two persons were arrested on Thursday for forging the signature of the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) and trying to dupe a firm.        
	Khondekar Zakir Hussain and Saurab Tapaswi, who were arrested near the Air India office on CR Avenue, had sent a letter to the firm offering to sell 17 bighas of police land in Bantala. The letter bore the signature of joint commissioner P.K. Chattopadhyay, who is also officiating as the deputy commissioner (headquarters).        
	The forgery came to light after the firm wrote to us, asking when it would get possession of the land, said Jawed Shamim, the city detective chief. The cops are looking for a third accused, Anup Banerjee.        
	Everest House raid: The Rs 3.82 lakh thrown off the 14th floor of Everest House on Wednesday is part of Rs 21.75 lakh seized by income tax officials from 31 premises of Sandip Mech Engineers Ltd.         
	The raids also yielded concealed income of Rs 14 crore and undeclared jewellery worth Rs 1.57 crore. The company is involved in construction in Rajarhat and Salt Lake.        
	Life term for killer driver: Truck driver Mehedi Hasan Bhandari, convicted of murder for mowing down a traffic sergeant, was awarded life imprisonment on Thursday. In June 2005, Bhandari had run over the sergeant in New Alipore.

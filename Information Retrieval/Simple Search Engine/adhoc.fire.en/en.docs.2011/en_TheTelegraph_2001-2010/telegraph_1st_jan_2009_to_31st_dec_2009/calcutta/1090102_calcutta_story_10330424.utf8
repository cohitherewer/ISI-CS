The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Ban, what ban? Its autocracy   Seize score   six on Day One
                                                                                                               Ban, what ban? Its autocracy     -  Seize score   six on Day One
        OUR BUREAU          CRACKDOWN CODE: STARE BUT DONT STOP                   A traffic sergeant looks on as a banned two-stroke auto goes past him on the Park Circus-EM Bypass connector on Thursday morning. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha                                                    
	Political parties threw their weight behind the auto brigade on the first day of the high courts ban on two-stroke engines, robbing Calcutta of the chance to ring in 2009 with Happy New Air.        
	From Topsia to Tollygunge and Beleghata to BK Pal Avenue, there was scarcely a street where two-stroke autos didnt run, many of them sporting party flags. Only six autos were seized during the day despite the high court specifying that the public vehicles department and the police must act against them.         
	The July 2008 order states: Registration of autorickshaws having two-stroke engines should be stopped immediately by the motor vehicles department and such autorickshaws should be phased out completely by December (31) 2008 The police authorities should ensure the implementation (of this order).        
	Heres what Metro saw on Day 1 of the ban.              
	GARIAHAT, 11am        
	Santu Pal, 19, was a picture of defiance. We are ready for the police, he said, seated in his two-stroke auto.         
	We have refused to sign an undertaking to replace our two-stroke autos because most of them were purchased recently and we are still paying the EMIs. We wont get fresh bank loans unless we clear all dues, said Keshto Mondol of the Citu-controlled union.               
	TOPSIA, 12.30pm                
	It was business as usual for Mohammed Ghulam on Thursday afternoon, ferrying passengers between Topsia and Park Circus on his two-stroke auto.         
	I was a little apprehensive in the morning despite our union assuring us that the police wouldnt confiscate our three-wheelers. But its been a hassle-free day so far, he said.                
	BK PAL AVENUE, 1pm        
	Prabir Mondal couldnt care less about the clean-air crusade. The only thing that matters to him is what our party says.         
	Nobody can take away our vehicles because we have the full support of our party. We have stayed with the party through thick and thin. Our leaders have assured us that our livelihood will not be taken away, Mondal said before driving his two-stroke auto towards Ultadanga.              
	SHYAMBAZAR, 1.15pm         
	The number of autos plying on the Shyambazar-Beleghata ID Hospital route was less than usual. Most of the three-wheelers ferrying passengers who had queued up near Deshbandhu Park were four-stroke ones, some running on LPG.        
	Some commuters put convenience above clean air. I have been waiting for an auto to go to Phoolbagan for nearly 20 minutes, complained Sumita Ghosh.              
	ULTADANGA, 2.15pm        
	Two-stroke autos outnumbered four-stroke ones on the Baguiati-Ultadanga, Ultadanga-Lake Town and Ultadanga-Salt Lake routes. Of the 50-odd three-wheelers parked at Ultadanga, we counted 27 of the two-stroke variety.                
	BEHALA CHOWRASTA, 3pm        
	Mihir Mondol, 55, said he was banking on his union leaders to bail him out if the police seized his two-stroke auto. There are less autos on the road now but everyone could be back on Friday because there has been no crackdown so far, he said.              
	LALBAZAR, 4pm        
	Thursday was the first day of the ban and the police acted on their own. We are chalking out a crackdown plan, said Pradip Chatterjee, the joint commissioner of police (administration). A traffic department team of 20, however, had only six two-stroke autos to show for their supposed crackdown.              
	WRITERS BUILDINGS, 4.30pm        
	The chief law officer of the environment department, Biswajit Mukherjee, said: Autos were on the streets as usual and we have no information yet about the police confiscating any three-wheeler.              
	PVD OFFICE, BELTALA, 4.45pm        
	We would like the police to start the crackdown. If we start seizing autos, there could be a law and order problem, a senior officer said.

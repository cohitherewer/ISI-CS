The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Need money? Just hire a trainee
                                                                                                               Need money? Just hire a trainee
  - Boss of dud IT firm still at large; partner claims he was duped too          A STAFF REPORTER                      An INFOGEN office in Sector V                                
	Anirban Ghosh, the absconding chief visionary of dud IT firm INFOGEN Global, had only one vision for his company  continue hiring people so that he could live off their security deposits.        
	The company was formed to dupe people. It would recruit batches of more than 100 engineering graduates at a time, take Rs 50,000 each as surety and use a part of that to pay employees inducted earlier, said Somnath Bhattacharya, the secretary of the West Bengal Information Technology Services Association.        
	But as the company grew  in numbers, if not in business  Ghosh and his partners found it increasingly difficult to keep the show going. The last batch of trainees did not get even a months salary, prompting them to file an FIR with Bidhannagar East police station on Tuesday.        
	State IT minister Debes Das met some of the trainees at Webel Bhavan in Salt Lake on Wednesday evening to assure them of justice but said he had no instant solution. My sympathies are with them. But this is not a labour problem. Its a fraud and the police need to follow it up, he said.        
	Around an hour after the meeting ended, Prasenjit Roy, whose Dzire Communication had supposedly taken over INFOGEN in December, was escorted to Bidhannagar East police station along with his colleague Abin Bhattacharya for interrogation.         
	Prasenjit claimed his company had agreed to run INFOGEN on condition that Rs 40 lakh would be deposited in its account by the end of January. The money never came, which is why the salary cheques that Prasenjit had given the trainees bounced, a source said.         
	At Webel Bhavan, the cheated trainees requested the IT minister to help them find employment elsewhere. quot;We have nowhere to go. We are banking on the IT minister to arrange for jobs and a refund from INFOGEN, said Partho Ghosh, one of the 10 trainees who attended the meeting.                           
	Formed in 2005, the Sector V company with four offices and over 1,000 employees is not registered with any recognised IT association and has no audit report to show for the three years it has been in business. Its website is impressive, though.               
	One of the pages contains profiles of Ghosh and his colleagues, including fancy titles to go with their designations. The managing director and chief visionary calls himself quot;The Ritwik quot;, or quot;chief priest quot;. Abhirup Basu, the director of operations, is quot;The Knowledge Evangelist quot; and Debarchana Mitra Ghosh, the HR director, is quot;The Chief Architect of Team Building quot;. Debarchana is Ghoshs wife.               
	The website mentions customised software and web development as the companys core competency and contains a testimonial from an anonymous client.               
	The IT minister said engineering graduates should conduct quot;background checks quot; before taking up job offers. quot;The fact that this company was taking money from recruits should have made them suspicious. quot;               
	Investigators do not rule out a nexus between INFOGEN and the private engineering colleges from which most of the trainees were recruited. quot;Why else would a college allow an unregistered company to hold campus interviews? quot; an official asked.

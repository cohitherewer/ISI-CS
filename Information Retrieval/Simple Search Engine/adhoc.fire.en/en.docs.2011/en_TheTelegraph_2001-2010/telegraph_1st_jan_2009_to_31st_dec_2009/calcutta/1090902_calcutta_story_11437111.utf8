The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cord blood gift of life for trader
                                                                                                               Cord blood gift of life for trader
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A rare transplant of umbilical cord blood from a newborn girl has given a 43-year-old aplastic anaemia patient a new lease of life.         
	Rabindra Mallick, a trader, was diagnosed with the disease  in which the bone marrow becomes incapable of producing sufficient blood cells  at a private hospital in May 2008.        
	The first option was bone marrow transplant but his siblings tissues were not matching. With his condition deteriorating we decided to go for cord blood transplant from an unrelated donor, said Ashis Mukhopadhyay, the medical director of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Cancer Research Institute.        
	Rabindras wife Ivy had taken him to Vellore last year where the diagnosis was confirmed but the treatment cost proved prohibitive. The couple have a 15-year-old son, Sourav, who will write his Madhyamik next year.        
	Mallick was undergoing regular transfusions since mid-2008 and was unable to work. It was a life-threatening situation, said Mukhopadhyay.        
	Mallicks condition worsened a few months back, prompting the decision to try cord blood transplant. He was admitted to the hospital on July 7. Six days of chemotherapy readied him for the transplant, by emptying the bone marrow cavity of his blood cells. He was kept in a high efficiency particulate air (Hepa) filter room, where no organism above 0.2 microns can enter, to guard against infection, said Mukhopadhyay.        
	A couple from Thakurpukur, the Goenkas, agreed to donate the umbilical cord blood of their child after learning that there would be no adverse effects on the newborn.        
	The girls blood group turned out to be different from Rabindras but the doctors found a way around the challenge. In the 38 days since the transplant, the condition of the trader has improved. His haemoglobin count has increased to 12.1 gram per cent from 5.6. His white blood cells and platelets have also come up to normal level. He is being discharged, said Mukhopadhyay.        
	Mallick told Metro: I hope to be able to start working again in four months.

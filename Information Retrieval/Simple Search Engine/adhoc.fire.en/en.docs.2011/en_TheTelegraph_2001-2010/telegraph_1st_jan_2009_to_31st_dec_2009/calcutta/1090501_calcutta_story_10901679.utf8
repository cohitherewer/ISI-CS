The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pre-election drive against arms
                                                                                                               Pre-election drive against arms
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The police top brass have asked all 48 police stations in the city to make a list of the owners of licensed firearms as part of a pre-poll drive to flush out illegal arms.        
	The head of each police station has been asked to designate an officer who will visit the homes of the owners of licensed arms. The cops will assess the criminal records, if any, of the owners and decide whether to impound the arms licence.        
	Six licences have been impounded so far. Over 500 arms have already been deposited to various police stations. Our drive will continue till the elections, said an officer.        
	Sources said cops were trying to trace criminal hideouts on the city fringes and in the port area, where illegal arms are reportedly being stockpiled.        
	The police are also verifying reports of entry of illegal weapons from North and South 24-Parganas into the city.        
	In North 24-Parganas, officers said 114 licensed firearms, ranging from double-barrel guns to sophisticated 9-mm pistols, have been deposited. The owners also deposited 178 rounds of ammunition, said Supratim Sarkar, the superintendent of North 24-Parganas police.        
	There are 1,124 licensed firearms in the district but we are not sure about the number of illegal firearm dealers, said an officer.         
	Officers have been asked to stay alert to prevent arms infiltration into the district, particularly from the porous Bangladesh border and the river route, he added.         
	In South 24-Parganas, cops raided Behala, Thakurpukur, Regent Park, Metiabruz and Mahestala and seized 74 unlicensed arms, 105 rounds of cartridges and 58 bombs.        
	District police chief Ajey Ranade said 261 licensed arms were deposited till Wednesday.

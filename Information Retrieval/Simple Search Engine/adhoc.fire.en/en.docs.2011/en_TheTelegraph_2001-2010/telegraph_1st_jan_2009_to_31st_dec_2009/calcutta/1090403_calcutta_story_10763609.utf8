The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Votes for skipper Sourav
                                                                                                                 We Ask You Answer      Votes for skipper Sourav
          Todays question: Who do you want to see as captain(s) of Kolkata Knight Riders and why? More responses will be published next week                    Captain Sourav Ganguly amid teammates at Eden Gardens in the inaugural version of IPL

	I want to see Sourav Ganguly as the captain of Kolkata Knight Riders as he is an all rounder with enough experience of captaincy. His performance has been excellent and hope he would achieve success in the ensuing IPL tournament to be held in South Africa.               
	Nivedita Dutta, 
  Lalkuthi Parthanagari         
	I want to see Jacques Kallis of South Africa as the captain of Kolkata Knight Riders. He is the best all-rounder of the world. And I want the best player for my very own, very favourite KKR.

	Want to see Sourav Ganguly as the captain of Kolkata Knight Riders. As a Bengali he deserves to represent the team. He has proved earlier that he is a confident and sincere captain who has the ability to guide his team to the pinnacle of success.

	Dada is the only alternative to Dada. He is the best in all aspects when he is on the field. Ganguly has the inborn capacity to change the game plan and win a match.       
	Kajal Chatterjee, 
  Sodepur									      
	I want to see Indias best and most successful captain Sourav Ganguly leading Kolkata Knight Riders. Sourav has not only displayed excellent all-round abilities in the last IPL, he also gallantly led his team throughout the tournament. Apart from Chris Gayle, no captain has the experience to lead the team well. But even Gayle is no match for Sourav as far as success rate of captains is concerned.              
	Dutun Das,
  Address not mentioned        
	I want to see Laxmi Ratan Shukla as the captain. Buchanan says he wants to develop leaders, then why choose an established leader like Ricky Ponting? He should choose young Indians as the four captains of KKR.

	I want to see Sourav Ganguly as the only captain of Kolkata Knight Riders . The idea of multiple captains must be rejected because that will destroy group cohesiveness. In fact, the idea has been floated by a group with vested interest to create an atmosphere of uncertainty and also to adversely affect Gangulys performance and mental frame. I strongly object to such an idea which is nothing but a conspiracy against Sourav.               
	Atif Ayaz, 
  Serampore        
	Too many cooks spoil the broth.I dont think three or four captains will make any difference. Ill not favour such an idea. Its not a winning formula. Sourav is my only choice as a captain of KKR. If we already have the best skipper in our team then why should we go for anyone else? He elevated Team India to a very high level during his tenure. A lot of cricket is still left in him to contribute to KKR. Im sure he will achieve new heights in the T-20 format of the IPL.       
	Kalyan Ghosh,

	It is strange that so much hue and cry is being made to decide if Sourav Ganguly should be the one and only captain of the Kolkata Knight Riders. His performance both with the bat and as a captain in the last IPL was really mediocre. It is well within the rights of coach John Buchanan and owner Shahrukh Khan to look towards other star players. I do not find anything wrong in it. Sourav or his rather fanatic supporters (including some in the media also) should allow the coach and the franchisee to do their job properly.      
	D.D. Ghose, 
  Ballygunge									      
	I want Sourav Ganguly as the captain of KKR because world class cricket players are expected to participate in the tournament and raise the level. The idea of four captains as an experiment is being done to defeat the purpose of SRK. Why does not Buchanan go back to his own country and try this experiment and come back with the results?      
	Fazal Hussain, 
  Camac Street									      
	I agree with the decision of coach Buchanan to rotate the captaincy while playing different opponents in the IPL games. This will infuse more interest among team members and will certainly see better strategies being worked out. I fully endorse the idea of having Sourav Ganguly as the lone captain for all the matches but keeping in mind his personal form and his growing age Buchanans plan has a meaning and I am sure will boost the morale of each player. Therefore, my views would be to rotate Brendon McCullum, Brad Hodge, Laxmi Ratan Shukla and Sourav Ganguly as captains for KKR in different matches rather than leave the burden of captaincy only on Dada.      
	Amrita Mallik, 
  Salt Lake									      
	A team with four captains sounds horrible. Only one can be a leader and not many. I vote for a single leader and that too Sourav. Nobody can take his place. He has already proved his efficiency as a team captain in international cricket. The team spirit under his leadership stood out. His excellence in the field is manifold and he is known for fierce batting and bowling skills. Kolkata Knight Riders deserves Dada at the helm.       
	Kalyan Mitra, 
  Dhakuria									      
	I strongly feel that Sourav Ganguly should be retained as the only captain of KKR. Brendon McCullum, Chris Gayle and Brad Hodge are capable but cannot give better leadership ability than Sourav. They have never handled the job for their respective national teams at the international level. McCullum and Hodge just played two or three matches for KKR last year while Gayle was a guest in the team. Except McCullum the performance of the other two was not even mediocre.       
	Vinay Kumar Dokania, 
  Vip Road   
	Sourav Ganguly should be the captain of KKR. The idea of having other captains is foolish. It would go against the integrity and harmony of the team.   
	A.S.Mehta, 
  New Alipore					      
	I would like to see Sourav Ganguly as the sole captain of KKR for the current IPL tournament. Let John Buchanan look for a captain/captains for the 2010 IPL matches, by that time Sourav would be 38 and physically unfit for the T20 format.

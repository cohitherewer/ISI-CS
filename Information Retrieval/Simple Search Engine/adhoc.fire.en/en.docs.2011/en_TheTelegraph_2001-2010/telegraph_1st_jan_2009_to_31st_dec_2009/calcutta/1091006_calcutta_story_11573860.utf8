The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | City-born scientist honoured 
                                                                                                               City-born scientist honoured 
  - Nailing drug abuse, fighting killer disease          RITH BASU                                          
	Indian-born Amitava Dasgupta was conferred the Irving Sunshine Award in Montreal on Sunday for his contributions to toxicology, including devising techniques to nail drug abusers who take medicines before tests to avoid detection.        
	The award is conferred by the International Association for Therapeutic Drug Monitoring and Clinical Toxicology, the only international body representing hospital-based toxicologists dealing with patients. Dasgupta, a professor of pathology and laboratory medicine at the University of Texas Health Sciences Center in Houston, is the first Indian to get the award.        
	Employers in the West are often hoodwinked by drug abusers, including sportspersons, who take certain drugs before tests to avoid detection. I have devised tests to call their bluff, said Dasgupta, a Hare School and Presidency College (chemistry) alumnus.        
	Dasgupta testified on the subject before the United States Congress in 2005. The 51-year-old is also on the editorial board of the Therapeutic Drug Monitoring Journal and other magazines.         
	Dasgupta visits Calcutta every Durga puja and spends much of his time at his Paikpara pandal, taking part in cultural programmes and long addas. This year, he was a judge in The Telegraph Hand in Hand recipe contest and won second prize in the three minutes to fame segment, reciting a parody of Jibanananda Dass Bonolota Sen, which he had penned.         
	My wife Alice, a criminal lawyer, and I come for Puja every year. And because I find my true calling in literature, I cant stay away from the para stage, smiled Dasgupta.

                 Criminal neglect: Parts of Salt Lake stadium, once the citys pride, in disrepair. Telegraph pictures                             
	Apropos Net fraud victims multiply, May 30, it is difficult to sympathise with people who fall for such Internet scams. It is either gullibility or oversmartness to think that money will just fall from the sky. And one has to pay for such foolhardiness.           
	Craving for unearned income and maintaining an unaffordable lifestyle have become a malaise in Bengal today.           
	Recent data compiled by the government also supports this view. The dismal figures for our state in the government report on the execution of the national rural employment guarantee scheme for the year 2007-2008 show that in Bengal people are reluctant to work hard.           
	With respect to the above- mentioned Net fraud, I would like to point out that if an engineer and the relative of a lawyer complain of losing Rs 1.36 lakh and Rs 2.5 lakh respectively to Nigerian fraudsters, it is time for the taxman to probe their I-T returns and track the origin of their income.           
	Tapan Pal,
  Batanagar                       
	Salt Lake stadium is not only one of the prides of Calcutta but of the country as well. It was shocking to read the report Neglect toll on showpiece stadium, June 1. The pictures accompanying the report show the backyard of the stadium lying in utter neglect. The lack of maintenance is also clearly visible. It is most unfortunate that because of slack vigilance, drug addicts have turned the area into their den, while thieves make away with valuable trees and iron railings.             
	Hopefully the Metro report will act as an eye-opener for the custodians of the stadium and prompt them to take immediate action to clear the garbage and deploy more guards to stop criminals from entering the premises.           
	Sourish Misra,
  Salt Lake             
	It is shocking that air pollution figures collected by manually operated machines are not reliable (Count shocker in gas chamber, June 5). The report says that polluting particles that enter our lungs, causing irreparable damage, are four times the nationally accepted standard. Naturally, Calcutta has become the pollution capital of the country.             
	It is appaling that none of the political parties bothers about the abysmal situation. The courts have issued directives to combat pollution, but in order to take effective action, the data collected must be accurate. Otherwise, all attempts will be in vain.           
	Dinabandhu Mukherjee, 
  Behala           
	The figures collected by automatic devices for measuring respirable particulate matter should send a shiver down the spine of Calcuttans, who have so far been kept in the dark about the actual level of pollution in the city air.           
	No wonder there is a marked increase in the number of people suffering from respiratory disorders as well as lung cancer. The foul air we breathe could have been purer had there been strict enforcement of the ban on polluting vehicles, deployment of trained personnel and installation of more automatic machines to measure pollution along with planned maintenance of greenery and water bodies.           
	For reasons best known to our politicians, this city is lagging far behind the rest of the nation in combating pollution.           
	Jaya Ghosh, 
  Sarat Banerjee Road           
	It is true that the governments approach to combating pollution leaves much to be desired. But more than administrative inertia, its the deplorable lack of civic sense on the part of the public that is to blame for unchecked pollution in the city. The systematic destruction of greenery, the filling up of wetlands by promoters in violation of municipal rules, emissions from old vehicles, the existence of two-stroke autos despite the ban  these and other such actions have greatly contributed to the alarming level of pollution in Calcutta.           
	To rid the city of the stigma of being the pollution capital, some steps are urgently called for. The government and the public have to work together. We must plant more trees to absorb gases emitted by factories and vehicles, improve the sewage system in the city by setting up sewage treatment plants, stop wastage of water, curb air and noise pollution, use more biodiesel and solar energy, etc.           
	P.B. Saha, 
  Salt Lake                       
	Apropos Plea plan against Sourav school, June 8, it is perplexing to learn that Sourav Ganguly, Indias most successful skipper, has run into trouble regarding his plan to build a school in Salt Lake. Sourav is a great cricketer. I wish he focuses on a cricket academy where budding cricketers can bloom and bring laurels for India.             
	Prahlad Agarwala,
  Majdia, Nadia           
	Sourav Ganguly is keen to build a school on the CA 222 plot, between Salt Lake School and Hariyana Vidya Mandir. But he should realise that students of the schools play on that plot during recess. Residents also fear congestion and noise pollution if another school comes up in the area. Ganguly should build a school in an area like New Town, where a school is most needed.           
	B.N. Bose, 
  Dum Dum Park           
	Apropos Politics of Sourav plot, June 10, 2009, the war of words between rival political parties regarding Sourav Gangulys proposed school in Salt Lake is unfortunate. But the opinions of the local residents appear to suggest that a new school is not welcome in the neighbourhood. One wonders why Ganguly is so adamant on setting up this school despite strong opposition from the public.           
	Trinamul leaders are evidently eager to take a dig at Ganguly, who has been a Left supporter.           
	One of the allegations was that Ganguly was given this plot at a throw-away price by the CPM urban development minister, Asok Bhattacharya. Political leaders in India are known for baseless allegations and lies. But Ganguly might have received the plot at a reduced price, because of which he is now reluctant to shelve his plan.           
	But the ex-skipper must listen to the voice of ordinary people who are not connected with any political party. The residents do not want a new school in their locality and this should be reason enough for Ganguly to change his plan.           
	Kunal Saha, 
  Ohio, US                   
	Jogamaya Devi College and Muralidhar Girls College have very rightly expelled 150 girls who resorted to violence after being barred from taking the Part-I examination because of low attendance (150 girls expelled in rap on the rowdy, June 13, 2009). The action was timely and appropriate. All parents and guardians must support the colleges for their tough but correct stand in the larger interest of bringing some semblance of discipline on college campuses.             
	A.S. Mehta, 
  New Alipore                   
	Its heartening that the authorities have planned to offer Metro rail passengers the facility of multi-ride smart cards to reduce serpentine queues during peak hours at Metro stations. Teaming up with post offices and selective PCOs will be of immense help in outsourcing the ticketing process (Metro tickets eye PCOs, June 1). Also, more people should be recruited to man the ticket counters at Metro stations for smoother functioning of the service.

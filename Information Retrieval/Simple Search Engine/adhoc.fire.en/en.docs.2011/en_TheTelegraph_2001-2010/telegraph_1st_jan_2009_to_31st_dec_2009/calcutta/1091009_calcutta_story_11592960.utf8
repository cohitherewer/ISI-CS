The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Obama envoy on two-day city visit
                                                                                                               Obama envoy on two-day city visit
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Timothy J. Roemer                                  
	The US ambassador to India, Timothy J. Roemer, will arrive in Calcutta on October 13 for a two-day visit.        
	On his maiden visit to the city, Roemer, who assumed office in August, will meet chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Writers Buildings.        
	The chief ministers secretariat couldnt, however, confirm the meeting. We have heard about such a visit, but the US consulate has not officially approached us yet, was the word from Writers on Thursday.        
	But the American Chamber of Commerce (AMCHAM) was upbeat about Roemers visit. From our perspective, it is a significant development that ambassador Roemer has decided to visit Calcutta, said Aniruddha Lahiri, the chairman of AMCHAM Calcutta.         
	At this juncture, when on account of various reasons, Bengal has taken a bit of a backseat, there must be a renewed effort to bring it back on the US investment map. And who better than the ambassador to signal the start of such a renewed effort? he added.        
	Roemers Calcutta itinerary includes a visit to Rabindranath Tagores ancestral home at Jorasanko, Mother House and Shishu Bhavan.        
	He will distribute certificates for the English Language Microscholarship Program to 100 students at the Great Hall WSA English Medium School in Kidderpore and address the media at the American Center before returning to New Delhi.         
	Before his appointment as ambassador to India by US President Barack Obama, Roemer was the president of the Center for National Policy in Washington DC, a think-tank.

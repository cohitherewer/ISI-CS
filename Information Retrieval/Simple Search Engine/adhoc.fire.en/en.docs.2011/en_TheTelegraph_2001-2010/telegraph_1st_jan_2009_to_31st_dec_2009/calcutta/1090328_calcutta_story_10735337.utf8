The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Blow from bus tyre burst kills woman on board
                                                                                                               Blow from bus tyre burst kills woman on board
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Anita Mondals daughter; the tyre (circled) that burst                                  
	A tyre of a private bus burst on Dhakuria bridge, resulting in the death of a woman on board.        
	Anita Mondal, 52, was on her way to meet her ailing father in hospital on Friday afternoon when the freak mishap claimed her life.        
	Police are yet to reconstruct the sequence of events leading to Anitas death but suspect that a part of a wooden footrest, ripped off under the impact of the tyre burst, shot across and hit the womans neck and head.        
	A traffic sergeant rushed the resident of Bijoygarh to AMRI Hospitals, where her father and daughter were waiting for her, but she was declared dead on arrival.        
	Preliminary medical reports suggest that the woman had suffered splinter injuries in the head and neck. This led to severe bleeding from the neck, which might have caused her death. A post-mortem will be conducted, said a source in the hospital.        
	The driver and the conductors of the private bus on route 17A (WB19-6860), travelling from Golf Green to Howrah, fled after the mishap. The vehicle was impounded and brought to Lake police station.        
	A case has been registered and we are looking for the driver and the conductors, said an officer of Lake police station.        
	Anita was an employee of the civil construction wing of All India Radio. The office is housed in the Doordarshan complex of Golf Green.        
	Family sources said Anita was on her way to AMRI from office around 4pm when the mishap occurred.        
	Her 75-year-old father, Mohini Mohan Mondal, a cardiac patient, and daughter Anindita had reached the hospital at 3pm.         
	Mohini Mohan had an appointment with a doctor and the two were waiting for Anita to turn up. The womans son, Arnab, is an IT professional.        
	Police sources said Anita was seated next to the rear gate of the bus, on the row reserved for women.        
	Moments after the bus hit Dhakuria bridge, the right inner tyre at the back, almost diagonal to Anitas seat, burst.        
	The cops are in the dark about what happened just after the tyre burst, but a gaping hole under the seat opposite Anitas and the ripped-off footrest suggest that a part of the wooden plank flew across and slammed against Anitas neck and head.        
	Its bizarre. We are far from certain what happened after the tyre burst. I have never come across such a mishap in my career, said a senior police officer.

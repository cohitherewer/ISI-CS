The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Train of thought for Mamata
                                                                                                               Train of thought for Mamata
          SANJAY MANDAL ZEESHAN JAWED                          Mamata Banerjee has homework to do                                  
	Mamata Banerjee has made it loud and clear that as railway minister her priority is Bengal. The big challenge for her in Calcutta is to rev up or revive the home projects that have lost steam or direction. Metro gives Mamata some homework ahead of her first day in office.              
	HOWRAH MAKEOVER        
	Meant to turn Howrah into a top-grade rail hub as part of a Rs 300,000-crore project for the modernisation of 20 stations across the country. The new-look station is to have superior infrastructure, separate departure and arrival halls, and elevators to take passengers from one platform to another.        
	Status report: The Railway Board has given the green signal to Eastern Railways construction wing. Process of awarding contracts for technical and architectural surveys is underway.         
	What Mamata needs to do: Fix a deadline for the project and ensure it is met.        
	Peoples voice: She will be doing lakhs of passengers a big favour by improving facilities at the station. It is a picture of chaos now, says Prabhat Singh of Rishra.        
	TOLLY-GARIA METRO        
	The 8.7-km stretch from Tollygunge to Garia runs along Tollys Nullah and includes six stations, five of them elevated. The project is meant to be the communication lifeline for South 24-Parganas.        
	Status report: Sanctioned in 1999-2000, it remains mired in land dispute. Work has been stalled near Birji station, in Garia, over the demolition of the Rajpur-Sonarpur Municipality building.        
	What Mamata needs to do: Pressure the state government to demolish the building so that the unfinished work can be completed by year-end.        
	Peoples voice: We have been waiting for the Metro for a long time. We are tired of overcrowded and delayed suburban trains, says trader Tarun Brahmachari.        
	DUM DUM-DAKSHINESWAR METRO        
	The 6.7-km stretch is to have three to four stations, with the state government bearing one-third of the project cost. Once completed, it will reduce the pressure on Sealdah station.        
	Status report: The feasibility survey for the project, proposed by Lalu Prasad in his last budget, has been completed. However, no commissioning date has been fixed.        
	What Mamata needs to do: Speed up the process and set a deadline.         
	Peoples voice: She must ensure this project does not go into cold storage like others, says teacher Debleena Roy.        
	CHITPUR EXPANSION        
	Two additional platforms and more trains.        
	Status report: Construction underway.         
	What Mamata needs to do: Ensure that the terminal, officially known as Kolkata station, is not underutilised. Must pressure the state government into introducing better transport facilities to and from the station.        
	Peoples voice: The station is clean but transport and porter facilities need to be looked into, says a passenger.               
	DUM DUM-AIRPORT LINK        
	A 3.2-km link that was Mamatas brainchild and cost Rs 112 crore. Inaugurated in mid-2006, it hasnt served its purpose because of poor planning. The new plan is to integrate it with Metro Railway.        
	Status report: Survey completed but project not yet sanctioned by the Railway Board.        
	What Mamata needs to do: Review flaws like the distance of the platform from the airport and co-ordinate with the Airports Authority of India to rectify them.        
	Peoples voice: The station is a 10-minute walk from the airport. Do they expect people to walk that far with luggage? asks Richa Daga.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Formal offer letter to Wipro
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Formal offer letter to Wipro
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The state government has written to Wipro offering contiguous plots spread across 50 acres in New Town at a concessional price to set up the companys second campus in Bengal.        
	We sent the letter on November 18 and are waiting for Wipro to confirm officially, IT minister Debesh Das told Metro on Friday at a programme organised by the city chapter of The Indus Entrepreneurs.        
	We have offered the land at Rs 1.5 crore per acre, which was fixed after discussions with Wipro officials, Das added.         
	On October 30, a Wipro team inspected the plots earmarked for the proposed facility in Action Area III, near the Shapoorji Pallonji Mass Housing project, and met officials of Hidco, which owns the land in New Town, and requested for 50 acres at a reduced price.        
	We had unofficially discussed the offer with Wipro and they were okay with it. The official letter has been sent. Now we will have to wait for the transactions to begin, said a senior Hidco official on Friday.        
	Wipro officials declined comment.         
	Price has been a stumbling block in the deal, with Hidco initially not willing to accept less than Rs 2.16 crore per acre.        
	Infosys, which had also expressed interest to set up a facility in Bengal in 2004, recently deferred its plans.         
	A few months back, the chief executive officer and managing director of Infosys, S. Gopalakrishnan (Kris), had said the company wanted to wait and did not require any more land for any new infrastructure at the moment.

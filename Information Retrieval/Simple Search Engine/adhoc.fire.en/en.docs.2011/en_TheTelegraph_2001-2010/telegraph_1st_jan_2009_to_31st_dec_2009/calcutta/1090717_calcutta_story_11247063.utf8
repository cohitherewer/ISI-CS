The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Commuters caught in crossfire
                                                                                                               Commuters caught in crossfire

	Mitali Chatterjee was waiting for a taxi at the Gariahat crossing on Thursday morning when she caught sight of a group of flag-waving, slogan-shouting protesters and said to herself: Oh, no! Not again!        
	Within minutes, the look of irritation on the Standard Chartered executives face turned into one of concern for safety as she realised this wasnt just another protest. They stopped a state bus, ordered the 25-odd passengers to disembark and set fire to it. I instantly knew this was going to spiral out of control, recalled Mitali, in her thirties.        
	Similar scenes were enacted at all key intersections in the city, starting during the morning rush hour and continuing till late afternoon.        
	The attack on the state bus at the Gariahat crossing around 9am was followed by one being torched at the AJC Bose Road-Sarat Bose Road crossing at 11am. State buses are the symbols of the government, which is why we are targeting them, said a young man in the mob.        
	A group of policemen deployed at the crossing looked on as the mob then marched towards Jadubabus Bazar.         
	Protesters also put up roadblocks at Hazra, Rashbehari Avenue crossing and Jadavpur, throwing traffic in south Calcutta out of gear for several hours.        
	A man stranded with his son on Howrah bridge around 11.30am complained that the police werent doing anything to rein in the protesters.        
	According to the Lalbazar control room, 143 protesters were arrested.         
	Many stranded commuters said they decided to return home after seeing protesters smashing windshields and setting buses ablaze. I walked all the way to Sealdah station from MG Road because the College Street crossing was blocked. I later heard that the same protesters burned a bus on the Sealdah flyover, said Tamali Basu, a student of Calcutta University from Barrackpore.

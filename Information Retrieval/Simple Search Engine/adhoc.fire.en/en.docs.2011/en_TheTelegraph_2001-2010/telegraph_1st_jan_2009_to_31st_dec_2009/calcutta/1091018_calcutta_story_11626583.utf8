The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Combat Diwali haze
                                                                                                               Combat Diwali haze
                              Fireworks release huge amounts of carbon dioxide on combustion                            
	The fireworks started in earnest from Friday night as Diwali arrived one day too early in the city. But Diwali and Kali puja are not just about the noise devil any more. In the last few years firecrackers have increased the citys air pollution considerably.         
	Air pollution has been significantly influenced by the burning of fireworks on these nights. In the last two years we found that both respirable particulate matter (RPM) and nitrogen oxide levels went up appreciably during Kali puja and Diwali, said Dipak Chakrabarty, the chief scientist of the state pollution control board.        
	Though the pollution control board does not measure carbon dioxide as regularly as it checks RPM and nitrogen oxide, Chakrabarty feels that a huge amount of carbon dioxide is generated on these nights, which must have an impact on local climate.        
	Siddhartha Dutta, an environment expert at Jadavpur University, agrees. Millions of fireworks are lighted on Diwali, which not only release a huge amount of particulate matter on combustion but also carbon dioxide, the key green house gas affecting climate change, he said. According to Sanjay Dutta, the secretary of the Burrabazar Fireworks Association, nearly 100 tonnes of fireworks were sold in the state this year  almost 70 per cent of them in the city and its suburbs.         
	Siddhartha Dutta says 100 tonnes of fireworks can release around 10 tonnes of carbon dioxide on combustion. Most fireworks are made from sulphur compounds, metals and other organic compounds.        
	We need to come up with relevant studies and norms to minimise the climate impact potential of fireworks, said Biswajit Mukherjee, the chief law officer of the environment department.         
	If the impact of blasts during war is found to be severe on climate, the same impact, may be on a smaller scale, can happen during Diwali in a city like Calcutta, where the chance of wind dispersion, specially in winter, is low.         
	Immediately after Diwali in 2008, a haze prevented flights from taking off from Dum Dum airport.         
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government, however, can take a cue from Barack Obama. The American government is considering bringing in tighter regulations to prevent emission of carbon dioxide from the burning of fireworks  America burns around $200 million worth of fireworks every year  and scientists are trying to develop green and environment-friendly fireworks, which they hope will supplement traditional fireworks.         
	But that would be allowing Uncle Sam to prevail again. On climate too!                     JAYANTA BASU

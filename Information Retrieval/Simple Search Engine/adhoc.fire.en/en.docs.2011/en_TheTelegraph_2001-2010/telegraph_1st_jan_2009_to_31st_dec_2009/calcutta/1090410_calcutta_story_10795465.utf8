The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cases many, action none 
                                                                                                               Cases many, action none 
  - Violators go scot-free          OUR BUREAU                          A wall graffiti in the city                                        
	More than 1,400 cases have been lodged alleging that political parties have painted graffiti on private walls without consent from the owners. Not one violator has been booked.        
	Reason 1: Police are not being able to trace the persons who are actually painting the walls.        
	Reason 2: In almost every case, the alleged violators are filing consent letters from the owners within 72 hours of receiving a notice from the authorities.        
	According to the CMC Act, neither the party nor the candidate concerned can be held responsible for any violation of the graffiti rules. The axe should fall on the paintbrush brigade, instead.        
	But its a waste of time trying to locate such brigades, for most of their members are hired, said an officer of Phoolbagan police station.        
	Parties take advantage of the rule and deny that their members or supporters have defaced the walls. Its a mockery of the rule, the officer of added.        
	An officer of Narkeldanga police station echoed the views of his colleague from Phoolbagan. There was a complaint of a private wall on Narkeldanga Main Road being painted without the owners consent. We informed the returning officer, who asked us to identify those who had done the painting. A week has passed but we are still in the dark about their whereabouts.        
	As for the other reason for zero prosecution, C.R. Das, the returning officer of Calcutta North, said: As soon as we receive a complaint, we ask the head of the party concerned to produce a copy of the consent form within 72 hours or clean up the wall. The consent forms usually arrive by the deadline. At times, the parties clean up the walls after learning that a complaint has been filed.        
	We have received around 400 complaints in the past month but I think in almost all cases, the parties have submitted the consent form within the stipulated time, said B.P. Gopalika, the returning officer of Calcutta South.        
	Prosecution has to follow the law. If the CMC Act states only graffiti painters can be booked, the commission can hardly do anything about it, said a poll panel official.

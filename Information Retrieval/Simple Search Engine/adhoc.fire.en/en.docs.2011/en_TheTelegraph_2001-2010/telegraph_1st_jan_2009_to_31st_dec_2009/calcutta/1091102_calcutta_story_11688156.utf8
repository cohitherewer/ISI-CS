                      Inside story of a besieged nation                    A play based on an internet blog of the same name posted on the web in 2003, Baghdad Burning is written by an Iraqi woman who prefers to remain anonymous under the title Riverbend. As the name itself suggests, the entries talk about the US occupation of Iraq and a permanent callous destruction of a whole country, the lifestyle of its people and the secular and modern fabric of its society. However, what makes it unique is the completely unsentimental view and the sharp and witty critique it provides on the impact of this completely unjust war on the common people and their daily life. It also lays bare the farce of democracy that the US plays out on this country through its puppet government. The play attempts to capture some moments of the daily life of the people of Iraq as they struggle to keep their sanity in a world crumbling around them. It also highlights some of the harsh political and economic realities that the country is encountering with the complete breakdown of law and order. Direction: Kirti Jain.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fleeting glimpse of darkness at dawn
                                                                                                               Fleeting glimpse of darkness at dawn
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	The centurys longest total solar eclipse played peekaboo with stargazers from a cloud-laden Calcutta sky on Wednesday, giving only a fortunate few a glimpse of the moment when the sun was at its smallest in the city.        
	This is awesome, the experience of a lifetime, exclaimed Class IX student Yash Vardhan Bhotica, sporting solar goggles and scanning the eastern sky from Science City along with a small group of enthusiasts.        
	A much larger group was stationed at Birla Industrial and Technological Museum (BITM) on Gurusaday Road, in south Calcutta, but a patch of cloud eclipsed the peak moment at 6.26am.         
	The motley crowd of children, parents, amateur astronomers and scientists had been waiting since 5.30am for a glimpse of the celestial phenomenon and cheered loudly when the sun first appeared from behind the clouds around 6.05am. But the excitement was short-lived.         
	 This was my third total solar eclipse and I was more excited for my son and daughter this time because it was to be their first. Unfortunately, the eclipsed sun gave us only a fleeting glimpse, said G.P. Das, a professor of physics.        
	At Science City, the sky remained partially clear between 6.20 and 6.45am. There were clouds but they did not spoil our view during the key period. We clearly saw the sun at 6.26am, which was when it was most obscured in the city, said G.S. Rautela, the director-general of the National Council of Science Museum.        
	The next total solar eclipse will be on August 2, 2027, but wont be visible from India. Wednesdays total eclipse was seen in its entirety only from a few places in southeast Asia. In Bengal, Siliguri was to have been a vantage point but a cloudy sky played spoilsport.        
	The US consul for political and economic affairs, Matthew K. Asada, was among those who had assembled on the BITM terrace to track the eclipse. He may not have got the best view but the enthusiasm all around left him pleasantly surprised.        
	It was interesting to see so many activities revolving around the eclipse, especially the interest of students in the whole process. I managed to catch a few glimpses (of the eclipse). There was a lot of oohing and aahing whenever the sun became visible, which says a lot about peoples interest in science here, said Asada.         
	Minutes before the moment of total eclipse, the crowd trooped back into the museum for a simulated show that transported them from Calcutta to Shanghai. We used a planetarium software to project the eclipse and take viewers on a virtual journey based on the actual latitude and longitude of the sun, moon and earth to replicate the real eclipse, said Dilip Ghosh, the education officer of the BITM.        
	By 7.31am, when the sun was back to its original form, the kids, parents, enthusiasts and officials who had gathered at the museum couldnt be happier. We are happy with whatever we saw. I had feared that nothing would be visible because of the cloud cover since Tuesday, said Poulomi Kumar, a Class X student of Pratt Memorial School.         
	Tulshidas Basak, 80, said he would remember the peak moment for the rest of his life while homemaker Pompa Dey, 39, felt like a student again.

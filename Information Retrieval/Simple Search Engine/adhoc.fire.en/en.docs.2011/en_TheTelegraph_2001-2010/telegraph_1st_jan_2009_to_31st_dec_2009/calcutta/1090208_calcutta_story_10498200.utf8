The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A walk for theatre
                                                                                                               A walk for theatre

	It was curtains at Biswaroopa theatre after the devastating fire of 2001. The probe was inconclusive and the owners of the 54-cottah land at 2A Raja Rajkrishna Street remained elusive. Promoters have already descended on the prime property.         
	On February 4, residents led by the Hatibagan Sanskriti Chakro and Nattyamancha Banchao Committee, protested the destruction of Natok para (Biswaroopa was the third theatre to be burnt down after Star and Rangmahal in the same locality) with a Walk for Theatre. This was followed by a six-day theatre festival between February 4 and 9 on a makeshift stage at the site.        
	White boundary walls have come up where Biswaroopa (originally Sisir Kumar Bhaduris Srirangam) stood. Biswaroopa saw brilliant performances on the commercial stage by stalwarts till its decline in the 1980s.         
	We want to ask the promoters to build an auditorium named Biswaroopa on the new premises so that future generations know about our glorious stage heritage, said Samar Chakraborty of the Hatibagan Sanskriti Chakro.         
	The free-for-all festival, inaugurated by Sova Sen, will stage Sayaks Daurnama, Sohans Helmet, Anya Theatres Achhe Achhe Sthan, Sundarams Alokanandar Putrakanya, Mukho Mukhis Kurbani and Theatre Workshops Jadiya Galpo.               
	Maiden festival         
	The Minerva Natya Sanskriti Charcha Kendra will host its first theatre festival from February 14.         
	Till March 29, two plays will be staged every Saturday and one every Sunday at the renovated Minerva auditorium.         
	Around 15 city groups will take part in the festival, including Sundaram, Nandikar, Bohurupee, Sayak, Anya Theatre, Rangakarmee and Theatre Workshop. On Sundays, theatre personalities will deliver talks.         
	After the festival, the weekend slots will be replaced by plays from Minervas own repertoire. Our aim is to establish a touring repertoire with a regular number of plays produced each year, said Anup Motilal, the director of the culture department.         
	The festival will be followed by a felicitation ceremony for Khaled Chowdhury and Sova Sen and two seminars on Girish Ghosh, Sisir Bhaduri, Sambhu Mitra, Utpal Dutt and Ajitesh Bandyopadhyay.       SEBANTI SARKAR

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Life limps back to ravaged resort
                                                                                                               Life limps back to ravaged resort
  - Three Sundays on, Vedic Village welcomes trickle of residents amp; guests           KARO CHRISTINE KUMAR              THEN            The gutted reception at Vedic Village       NOW            The new reception at Vedic Village                                      
	Sunday, August 23, 4pm: Flames engulf the clubhouse at Vedic Village. Guests and staff members run for cover. The restaurant is deserted, the swimming pool is filled with debris, the reception, library, games room and conference rooms are reduced to rubble.        
	Sunday, September 13, 4pm: A new reception has opened adjacent to the old. Staff members are back at the front desk. A special buffet at the restaurant welcomes the first trickle of farmhouse owners and guests. Water gushes forth to refill the pool as a few children clamber to jump in. The library has fresh books and a new look.        
	Behind closed doors, Vedic Village is slowly coming back to life.        
	We are happy that things are inching back to normality. It was a traumatic experience for all of us but now guests and residents are returning and we feel at home again, said Sandeep Shah, a permanent resident of Vedic Village.        
	The Rajarhat resort ravaged by the arson of August 23 and rocked by the arrest of its builder bears obvious scars of the past three weeks. The main gate is shut and opens only after a round of questioning by the guards. Inside, the rubble has been cleared but reconstruction is awaited.              
	What used to be the reception area and the main activity zones now resemble ravages-of-war zones.        
	Sheetal, the 24-hour coffee shop just next to the clubhouse, has been converted into the new reception, a conference room is now the new library, and a function hall is now the games room.        
	People are few and far between. But those who were there three Sundays after the flare-up, seemed happy to be back.        
	Now I can look back and think that the worst is over. It was something I will never forget but it just feels so good to be back, said a British resident of Vedic Village who had shifted to Bangalore for these three weeks.        
	Another family of foreigners who hid in their farmhouse that Sunday, now sat at the bar sipping on welcome drinks while their two children waited to make a splash in the pool being refilled.        
	There are 17 guests in the resort and before the Pujas we expect many more. On September 18, an important conference has been booked and there are more to follow, said a member of the resort staff.

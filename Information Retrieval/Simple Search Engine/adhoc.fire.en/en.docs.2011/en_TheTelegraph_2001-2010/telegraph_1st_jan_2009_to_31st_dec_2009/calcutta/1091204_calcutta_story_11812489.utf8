                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Dementia meet focus on care and caregiver

	Psychiatrists and psychologists with international exposure would interact with relatives of Alzheimers patients and exchange ideas at the annual convention of the Alzheimers and Related Disorders Society of India starting Friday at a city hotel.        
	The three-day convention also aims to involve the central and state governments in initiatives for the neglected victims of memory loss.        
	According to the Indian Council of Medical Research, 48,000 elderly people in Calcutta are suffering from memory loss, confusion and disorientation as a result of Alzheimers and other causes like strokes.        
	We will complete the formulation of the national strategy on dementia and approach the government with it. We have been preparing the document at conventions across India for about a year, said Pritigopal Roy, the director (policy and programme) of the societys city chapter.        
	In states like Goa and Kerala, the state governments play a pro-active role in the care of dementia patients along with private partners, he added.        
	The sessions on the science of Alzheimers and the social aspects of caring for those suffering from it have been scheduled simultaneously.        
	The experts who are slated to attend include neurology professors John Hodges, of Addenbrookes Hospital in England, and Andrew Kertesz, of the University of Western Ontario in the US, and Daisy Acosta, a specialist in geriatric psychiatry and a founder of the Asociacion Dominicana de Alzheimer. Experts from across India will join the 30-strong international contingent.        
	We will counsel those who care for dementia patients in their homes. They get very depressed as caring for the patients can be thankless. The patients dont realise that they are being helped and often blame caregivers, said Jyotirmoy Samajdar, a senior psychiatric consultant of the society.         
	Actor Soumitra Chatterjee, author Shirshendu Mukhopadhyay, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya and police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti  friends of the Alzheimers society  would speak to delegates on the second day.        
	An exhibition showcasing works by artists like Jogen Chowdhury, Samir Aich and Suvaprasanna as well as children, will be held at the venue.

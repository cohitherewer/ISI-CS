          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The state urban development department has taken up a Rs 21-crore plan for beautification of BBD Bag with funds provided under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM).         
	State urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said the state and the central governments would chip in with Rs 7.21 crore each while the Calcutta Municipal Corporation will bear the rest of the project cost.         
	The plans include relaying of footpaths, creation of roadside gardens and installation of ornamental railings and lamp posts. Beautification of Laldighi is also on the cards.         
	The project is a part of a Rs 8,873-crore package for urban development. The money will be spent on 254 projects, including schemes for drinking water supply, solid waste management, sewerage and drainage systems, purchase of buses and construction of flyovers, said the minister.         
	A senior official of the urban development department told Metro that there were plans to beautify Laldighi after the work on the underground car park opposite Writers Buildings was completed.         
	We will plant trees on the banks of Laldighi and put up ornamental light stands. We will also place benches in the area, he added.         
	Government buildings might get a coat of paint as part of the beautification. The plan was discussed during a state-level steering committee meeting for JNNURM projects.         
	The cost of some projects has gone up because of delay in execution. For example, when the work for the Nagerbazar flyover started, the estimated cost was Rs 48 crore. Now the project would require Rs 107 crore, said Bhattacharya.         
	According to him, the work got delayed by a number of factors, including problem in acquiring land and local resistance. He said that from now on a committee would monitor the progress of each project to ensure timely completion.

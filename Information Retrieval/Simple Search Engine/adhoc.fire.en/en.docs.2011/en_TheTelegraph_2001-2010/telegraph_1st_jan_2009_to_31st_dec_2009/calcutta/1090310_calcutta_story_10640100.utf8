The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Unity, discipline top Besu bosss agenda 
                                                                                                               Unity, discipline top Besu bosss agenda 
          ANASUYA BASU                          Ajay Kumar Ray                                   
	The new vice-chancellor of Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu), Ajay Kumar Ray, is considering withdrawing all pending police cases against students in a bid to foster unity on campus.        
	He has also urged the universitys 2,500-odd students to take an oath of solidarity.        
	The former professor of electronics and electrical communication engineering, and head of medical science amp; technology at IIT Kharagpur, took over the reins of Besu after one of its worst periods of campus violence.        
	Ray said his immediate task was to enforce discipline and a strict academic schedule.        
	The VC has asked all Besu students to assemble at the Lords ground on March 16 to take an oath of solidarity and fraternity.        
	The only way forward is to restore the academic atmosphere and inculcate a spirit of unity among the students and members of the faculty, said Ray, who held a series of meetings with teachers and students after assuming office on March 1. I found the students cooperative and supportive.        
	Ray has drawn up a new academic calendar according to which the first semester would be over by April 30.        
	All exams for masters and bachelors courses would be held simultaneously with no gaps. The faculty will have to finish assessing answer scripts within a week and show the papers to the students. There should be absolute transparency, Ray said.        
	The results will have to be declared within two weeks of the exams. By May 10, teachers should be free to pursue research and students join their industrial training, he added. However, Besu will have to wait a year to implement this schedule as the current semester has already been delayed by six weeks.        
	The VC is also planning to increase the number of research scholars five-fold, to 200. We will seek sponsored research for funding, he said.        
	Ray plans to strengthen the faculty by recruiting retired IIT professors living in Calcutta. S.K. Lahiri, a former deputy director of IIT Kharagpur, and Ashok Mallick, a retired teacher of IIT Kanpur, will join the electronics engineering and the mechanical engineering departments, respectively.

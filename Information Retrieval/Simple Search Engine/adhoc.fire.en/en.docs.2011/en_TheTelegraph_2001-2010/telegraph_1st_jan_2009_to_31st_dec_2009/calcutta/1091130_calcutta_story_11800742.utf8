The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Paws to protect Metro Rail
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Paws to protect Metro Rail
                            
	Metro Railway paid a city-based dog breeder Rs 28,000 for Cute and Rex. Another Rs 2 lakh will be spent on their training.        
	The cost includes the fees of three handlers who will be escorting them to Gwalior, said an official.        
	Life for Cute and Rex has been anything but puppy love even before they face the rigours of field duty.         
	They were initially fed four times a day but now they get only two meals a day, though their calorie intake remains the same, the RPF official said.        
	The duos calorie requirement comes from meat, milk, eggs, rice, vegetable, breads, chappatis and dog food. They are apparently being trained to make do with two meals a day so that they can work long hours without food, if the need arises.        
	The pups, who have been in Narkeldanga since they were a little over a month old, will get a new home on the Metro Railway campus near Belgachhia station after returning from training.        
	The dog squads of various security agencies include German Shepherds and Doberman Pinschers but Labradors are the favourites. Labradors are the best of the lot on several counts, especially intelligence and loyalty, said a handler.        
	Metro Railways decision to raise a dog squad is part of a derailed expansion plan that has been recently brought back on track.         
	Over the next 10 months, nearly Rs 1,000 crore worth of projects will be implemented to give commuters faster, safer rides in air-conditioned comfort by next Puja.        
	Metro Railway intends increasing the peak-hour frequency of trains to two minutes once more rakes are pressed into service.

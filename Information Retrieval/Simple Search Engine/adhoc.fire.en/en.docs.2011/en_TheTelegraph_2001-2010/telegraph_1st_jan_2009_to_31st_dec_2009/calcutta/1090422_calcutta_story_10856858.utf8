                                                                                                               SRK appeal for inmates
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Shah Rukh Khan on Tuesday appealed to the Alipore Central jail authorities to allow the inmates to watch the Kolkata Knight Riders matches in the IPL. The KKR owner made the appeal while answering a question from Mandira Bedi at the end of his teams victory against Punjab Kings XI.        
	To all authorities in Alipore jail, please allow the inmates to watch the matches... I dont know whether its legal or not but come on, its KKR playing, Shah Rukh said.        
	DIG (prisons) S.R. Hussain, who had heard about the actors plea, said a decision would be taken after the IG returned to the city.        
	More than 250 undertrials started an indefinite hunger strike on Sunday, which was withdrawn the next day, demanding that the TV sets on the premises be provided with cable connection so they could watch KKR matches in the IPL.

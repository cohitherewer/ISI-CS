The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Used car sales under scanner
                                                                                                               Used car sales under scanner
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Dealers in used cars and two-wheelers have been asked to send details of their customers to the local police stations.        
	The move is part of a security drive triggered by inputs from central intelligence agencies suggesting youths from across the border would land in Calcutta in the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls and engineer subversive activities.        
	If the terrorists are plotting to plant explosives in vehicles, they will most likely buy cheaper, used ones. So, we want to keep a tab on such buyers, said a police officer.        
	The police will also step up vigil on parked vehicles across the city. We will not allow vehicles to be parked in no-parking zones. Even the areas around the police headquarters in Lalbazar are not free of illegal parking. Two-wheelers of traffic sergeants and other officers, which are usually parked at the Out gate of Lalbazar and on Rabindra Sarani, will be removed, said an officer.        
	Cops have been asked not to park their vehicles on RN Mukherjee Road and Mangoe Lane either. We want to minimise the chances of anyone using a two-wheeler and posing as a cop to plant a bomb, the officer added.        
	The officers-in-charge of all 48 police stations in the city have been asked to meet representatives of the malls, markets and parking lots and brief them on how to check vehicles.        
	Parking lot attendants in malls and markets will have to take down the telephone numbers of the owners and drivers of the vehicles and also record how long a vehicle is being parked, the officer said.        
	Senior officers admitted on Monday that checking was inadequate at hotels in the New Market, Taltala and Park Street areas.         
	We have to step up the security drive. We are not taking the intelligence inputs casually, said an officer.

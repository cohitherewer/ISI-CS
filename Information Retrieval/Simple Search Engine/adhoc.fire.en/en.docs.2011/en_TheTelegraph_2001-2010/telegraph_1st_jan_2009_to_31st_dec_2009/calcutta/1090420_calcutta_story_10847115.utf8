                      Redefining terror                    An artists initiative, Khoj Kolkata was founded four years ago to provide an alternative platform for active debate and participatory experimentation in art. Currently, it has focused on joining hands with mainstream platforms of art practice and projection to address the issue of terror. Art Against Terrorism, its series of ongoing art shows, condemns terror and seeks to redefine the concept of terrorism within the limits of our daily lives. The main thrust of this creative enterprise is to find and establish new meanings for terror, in terms of its palpable, alarming and horrifying presence in the life of the common man. Confusing and at times incomprehensible as the issue may be, the eight artists, participating in this show, attempt to understand the ugly, monstrous face of terror through projects that include photography, video, animation, sculptural arrangements, graphic novels and community art projects. Participants: Srikanta Paul, Chhatrapati Dutta, Sanjeet Chowdhury, Tamal Mitra, Abhijit Gupta, Saikat Surai, Dipyaman Kar and Paula Sengupta. Supported by Chisel Crafts.                    Event: An exhibition of art works against terrorism When: Till April 21; 2 pm - 7 pm Where: Aakriti Art Gallery, 1st floor, 12/3A Hungerford Street

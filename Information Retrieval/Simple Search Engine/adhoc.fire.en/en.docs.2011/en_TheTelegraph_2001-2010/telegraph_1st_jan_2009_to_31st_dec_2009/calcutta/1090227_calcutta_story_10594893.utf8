	A four-and-half-year-old girl, who had swallowed a small bulb, can breathe easy again after a surgery at SSKM Hospital on Thursday.        
	A team of ENT surgeons removed the bulb from Pratima Alemagars left bronchus  a branch of the windpipe  after a bronchoscopy. The procedure continued for an hour.        
	The doctors said they had to be extra cautious as the foreign body was made of glass.        
	Had the bulb broken inside the lung, the fragments would have damaged the blood vessels, threatening the patients life, said Arunabha Sengupta, an associate professor at the ENT department of SSKM, who headed the team.         
	Pratima, a resident of Narendrapur, had swallowed the bulb of 2mm diameter while playing outside her home 10 days back.        
	She started coughing out blood and was having trouble breathing, said Jyotsna Mondal, a neighbour. Pratimas father Ambar is a driver and mother Mira a homemaker. A local doctor prescribed a purgative to flush out the bulb but that didnt help. A chest X-ray revealed the bulb was near her lungs, said Mondal.         
	In severe pain and unable to breathe properly, Pratima was admitted to SSKM on Wednesday.         
	We had to dislodge the filament, which was stuck in the bronchus wall, and pull it out. The glass portion could not be held with the bronchoscope as it would have broken, said Sengupta. If the bulb had broken she would have required an open surgery of the lungs.        
	Pratima is on oxygen support and will be under observation for 24 hours, the doctors said.         
	The case would be sent for publication in an international journal, they added.

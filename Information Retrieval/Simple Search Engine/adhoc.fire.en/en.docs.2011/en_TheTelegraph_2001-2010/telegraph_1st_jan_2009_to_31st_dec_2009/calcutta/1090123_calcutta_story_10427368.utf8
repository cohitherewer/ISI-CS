The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Attacker held, kids in trauma
                                                                                                               Attacker held, kids in trauma
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Housekeeper Archana Sangki, who threw boiling water on a bunch of kids playing in an adjoining school compound in Salt Lake, was arrested on Thursday.        
	An officer of Bidhannagar (North) police station said the 42-year-old woman, out on bail, promised never to repeat her mistake.        
	The victims of Salt Lake School were yet to recover from the trauma 24 hours after the housekeeper of CA 219 tried to teach them a lesson for allegedly being hit by a pebble that was hurled from the school compound.        
	My daughter is still in a state of shock. She said she would never play on the school ground again, said Baishali Ray, the mother of Oishi, who was among the 10 students injured on Wednesday.        
	Archanas lawyer, Shyamal Kumar Dutta, alleged that the students had provoked her.        
	The students of Class XI and XII often teased her and her 19-year-old daughter. She had complained to the school authorities but the students were not disciplined. On Wednesday, she lost her cool when a pebble thrown by a student landed on her, said Dutta.        
	The school authorities, however, denied having received any complaint from Archana about being troubled by the children. She had once verbally complained that a ball thrown by one of the students had shattered a windowpane in her employers house. We immediately repaired it, said school secretary Sumit Sengupta.        
	The school has decided to set up a five-ft-high iron fence on the wall and organise a counselling session to help the students overcome the trauma.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Neutral vote: choice of the young
                                                                                                               Neutral vote: choice of the young

	Numerous young Calcuttans are looking forward to casting their neutral vote on May 13 as an expression of disapproval of all candidates in their constituencies.        
	I support neither Amitabha Nandy nor Saugata Roy. The smaller candidates are useless. I will vote for nobody this time. Most of my friends will do the same. I wont abstain from voting as I dont want my vote to be fraudulently cast by others, said Kalyan Basu, 25, a resident of the Dum Dum constituency who works for a private bank.        
	I will cast the neutral vote as I am not impressed by any candidate in my constituency, said Sreerupa Sengupta, a PhD student and a resident of Jadavpur.        
	The right to cast the neutral vote, by which a citizen refuses to record his/her vote, is granted by the Rule 49 O of the Conduct of Elections Rules (1961) of India. The purpose is to prevent misuse of the franchise.        
	The long-forgotten rule has gained a lease of life, thanks to a sustained campaign by the election commission and a few NGOs.        
	The rule states: If an elector... decided not to record his vote, a remark to this effect shall be made... and the signature or thumb impression of the elector shall be obtained against such remark.        
	The provision, however, goes against the tenet of secret ballot. It violates my basic right to a secret ballot. If the political activists in my neighbourhood get to know that I have not recorded my vote, my family might face intimidation. But I will still cast the neutral vote, said Ritoban Das, 26, a resident of the Calcutta South constituency.        
	In an attempt to not expose the identities of the citizens who are casting the neutral vote, the central election commission has suggested that a None of the above button be incorporated in the electronic voting machine.        
	In a report to the Prime Minister in 2004, the then chief election commissioner, T.S. Krishnamurthy, had suggested: The law should be amended to specifically provide for negative/neutral voting. For this purpose, Rules 22 and 49B of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961 may be suitably amended adding a provision that there shall be a column None of the above to enable a voter to reject all the candidates, if he chooses so.        
	The recommendation is being considered by a parliamentary standing committee.        
	Samrat Dutta, a final-year MBA student, feels the None of the above option should be included at the earliest so the secrecy of the ballot is ensured. I want my vote to count against all candidates in my constituency. The results should clearly indicate the number of neutral votes cast, said Dutta, a resident of Calcutta North constituency.        
	The commission acknowledges the voters right to not choose any candidate... The fear that the present system of casting the neutral vote may result in intimidation is unfounded, said chief electoral officer Debashis Sen.

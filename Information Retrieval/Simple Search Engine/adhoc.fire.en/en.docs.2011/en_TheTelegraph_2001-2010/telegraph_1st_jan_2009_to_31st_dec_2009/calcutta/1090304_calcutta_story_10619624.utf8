The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Firms press for billboard safety
                                                                                                               Firms press for billboard safety
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The chairman of Bidhannagar Municipality, Biswajiban Majumdar, on Tuesday blamed Citu for Sundays trouble at City Centre even as the association for display advertising sought protection for billboards in Salt Lake.        
	The chief of the CPM-controlled civic body admitted that when the billboards were being put up at City Centre on Sunday, the firm hadnt informed the authorities.         
	But that would have been sorted out between the firm and the municipality. Under no circumstances should Citu have intervened as it was beyond its jurisdiction, Majumdar told Metro.         
	Some Citu-backed autorickshaw operators went on the rampage near City Centre on Sunday and pulled down several hoardings. Seven people were arrested for the fracas.        
	With the sharing of billboard revenue between the municipality and Citu taking an ugly turn, delegates of the Outdoor Advertising Association met Majumdar on Tuesday and requested protection for their display boards.        
	We sought the municipalitys intervention in protecting our billboards, said Nirmal Thakur, the general secretary of the associations city chapter. Majumdar assured them of police protection.        
	A zonal committee member is probing the case and the findings will be placed before the district secretariat on Wednesday, said a leader. Sources said action would be taken against two leaders, one of the party and the other of the autorickshaw union.        
	The party has showcaused Niloy Ghosh, a member of the local committee, and Citu leaders Pramod Jha and Suman Ghoshal.

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Rita Banerjee, in her 40s, was arrested on Sunday evening in her Garia flat on the charge of stealing cash, mobile phones and ATM cards at malls.         
	Rita, a postgraduate in music, has confessed to robbing at least three shoppers, the police said. The cops believe she was involved in more cases of theft. We recovered six cellphones, ATM cards and Rs 12,000 from her, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters).        
	Rita robbed a shopper on July 26 and two others on August 2 at a mall in Phoolbagan, said an officer.        
	One of the victims, Debosmita Dey of Amherst Street, lodged a police complaint that Rs 12,000, a cellphone and an ATM card were stolen from her handbag.        
	Cops tracked Debosmitas cellphone and traced its new owner, who said he had bought it from Shyamal Banerjee, Ritas husband.

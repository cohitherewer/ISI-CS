The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Puja budgets hit by the downturn blues   Battle to beat the blues
                                                                                                               Puja budgets hit by the downturn blues     - With sponsors feeling the slowdown squeeze, organisers are struggling to finalise festive plans          POULOMI BANERJEE                          Salt Lakes FD Block puja is one of the many biggies to feel the slowdown squeeze                                        
	The downturn is telling on Durga puja budgets across town with sponsors feeling the pinch and struggling to join in the festive celebrations this second quarter.        
	Salt Lakes FD Block, which had set the benchmark for opulence many years ago with a pandal modelled on the Titanic, has seen its silver jubilee budget sink by a few lakhs because its regular sponsors arent willing to splurge anymore.        
	We are looking at scaling down our budget to Rs 14-15 lakh from the earlier target of Rs 18 lakh, confirmed Santanu Biswas, one of the organisers of the showpiece Salt Lake puja. Last year we had tied up with an FM station for sole sponsorship rights. But we do not have such a sponsorship deal in the bag yet, with barely four weeks to go. This is the first time in many years that something like this has happened, rued Biswas.        
	Most other large pujas in the city are feeling the pinch. The cost of raw materials and labour has gone up by 10-15 per cent, but we have not been able to increase our budget. Companies are backing out citing lower allocation for sponsorships because of the meltdown. We have received verbal assurances from some companies but no official confirmation is forthcoming, said Nilanjan Deb of the Deshapriya Park puja committee.         
	The organisers of the Mudiali puja have settled for a realistic budget of Rs 20 lakh after initially pegging its platinum jubilee target at Rs 25 lakh. This is our 75th year and we were aiming for a budget of Rs 25 lakh. But we have been forced to curtail that, said Sandip Basu, a secretary of the puja committee.        
	Up north, Maniktala Chaltabagan Lohapatty has tightened its belt even before responses to sponsorship requests start coming in. Last year our budget was Rs 13 lakh but we have reduced it to Rs 12 lakh because of the difficult times. No company has refused us yet but we are ready for the squeeze, said organiser Ashok Jaiswal.         
	Companies admit that the downturn has forced them to tighten their purse strings this Puja as they struggle to beat the bottomline blues.        
	Peerless, which has advertised with many pujas in the city over the years, hasnt committed itself to any organising committee yet but doesnt rule it out either. We have not drawn up a strategy on Puja advertisements yet, admitted a company official.        
	Jayanta Roy, a director with Peerless, confirmed that less was being spent on advertising this year.                                
	So how do Puja committees intend meeting the anticipated shortfall?        
	It will be difficult, of course, because the idol-makers, the pandal decorators and other people whose services we require are all demanding more, added Jaiswal.        
	With sponsorships drying up, many organisers are falling back on the traditional subscription route and turning to small advertisers to meet their budgets.        
	Badal Bhattacharjee of the College Square puja committee said he always believed that subscription and advertisements  rather than sole sponsorship  was the best way to organise a celebration.        
	We have never given the advertising and branding rights to one company because that gives them the right to call the shots at the pandal, from stalls to billboards. Such a system also alienates regular advertisers and other well-wishers.        
	The College Square puja committee hopes to mop up Rs 25 lakh through its regular advertisers and subscriptions. We dont ask for more than Rs 1,000-2,000 from an individual; so we dont have a problem raising it, said Bhattacharjee.         
	At the Deshapriya Park puja, club members and residents of the area are chipping in to bridge the budget gap.        
	One of the few pujas not worrying about where the money will come from is Md Ali Park in central Calcutta.        
	Our budget for this year is Rs 15 lakh, and we are banking on our regular sponsors who have been with us for many years. This puja has a special significance and we are confident that our sponsors would never say no to us, said organiser Dinesh Bajaj.         
	Maddox Square, in the south, is another one that has escaped the cost-cutting.        
	We have a contract with the Zee group, which remains our sole sponsor. We have not received extra money to cover the increase in prices of raw materials and labour but it is heartening to know that our sponsor is still with us, said Sibshankar Basu of the Maddox Square committee.        
	But as Nilanjan Deb of Deshapriya Park warns, this could be the puja when budgets bottom out for good.        
	I dont feel upbeat. Something is lacking, he said.        
	He could be mirroring the mood of the moment.

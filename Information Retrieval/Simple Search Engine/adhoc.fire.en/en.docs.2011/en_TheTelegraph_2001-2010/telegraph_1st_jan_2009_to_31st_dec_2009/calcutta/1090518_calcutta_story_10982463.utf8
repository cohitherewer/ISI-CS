	The two elderly men who were lying naked, unattended and unfed at a state-run hospital for more than four days have found shelter in a private hospital.        
	The Mission of Mercy Hospital, on Park Street, sent an ambulance and support staff to the Medical College and Hospital on Sunday evening to pick up the unidentified duo, in their mid-70s.        
	Metro had on Saturday reported about their plight.        
	Officials at the Park Street hospital said the two emaciated men had been given food, clothes and medicines.        
	After reading about their condition we decided to bring them to our hospital. They will be kept here till we speak to state officials about their rehabilitation, said Sanjay Prasad, the chief executive officer of the hospital.        
	Doctors said both were severely undernourished. The the condition of one was critical. His left side is paralysed and he is suffering from altered mental condition and infection in the left eye, said the doctor who examined the duo.         
	The other man has an ulcer on his left shoulder.         
	At the hospital, they received sponge bath and a new set of clothes before being put on intravenous glucose drip. They will undergo a series of tests, the doctor said.        
	The hospital employees who had gone to fetch the duo said nurses and ward boys at the Medical College and Hospital did not cooperate with them. They were just not bothered about these two men, said an employee of the Mission of Mercy Hospital.        
	The man who is suffering from ulcer was brought to Medical College by residents of Arpuli Lane, off College Street, last Sunday night after he was spotted lying on the road. He remained in the emergency observation ward without any food or treatment till Friday morning, when the hospital authorities shunted him out because they needed the bed for a registered patient. Till Sunday afternoon, he was lying naked outside the ward.        
	The other man was on the floor of the same ward  apparently having fallen off the bed  without a stitch on him.        
	Pranab Mukherjee, the social welfare officer of Medical College, said the man who was thrown out of the ward had spent two nights in rain. Its a miracle that he has survived. I requested the emergency medical officers to take him in but they refused.

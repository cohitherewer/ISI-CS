	Ninety-five first-year students of Jogamaya Devi College, barred from appearing for the Part I exams because of inadequate attendance and poor results, gheraoed the principal and some teachers for nine hours on Monday.        
	The girls batchmates in City College had gheraoed the authorities for over 24 hours from Saturday noon to wrangle permission to sit for the examination.        
	On Monday, police rescued the Jogamaya teachers at 6.30pm.        
	The colleges governing body, students union and the teachers had met in July. It was decided that first-year students would have to maintain good attendance and good marks to appear for the examination, said principal Gargi Nath.         
	Students union members agreed that the meeting had taken place and more stringent measures agreed upon.        
	The authorities should have issued a notice stating that this years selections will be stricter, said Mansura Khatoon, the general secretary of the union.        
	Kalyan K. Bhattacharya, who teaches chemistry in the college, said students were told about the change of stance several times.        
	The students claimed irregularities on the part of the administration. There is a girl in our class, who got 8 and 6 in two papers in the selection test, and we have never seen her in class. How was she allowed to appear for the examination? asked Aratika Chatterjee of English honours.        
	Undergraduate students must have attendance of 75 per cent or more to sit for the university examinations. Those with attendance between 65 and 75 per cent can also sit for the exams after paying a fine.Calcutta University will not allow a single student having attendance below 65 per cent to sit for the undergraduate examinations, said Debashis Biswas, the deputy controller (examinations) of the university.        
	The girls also alleged that the policemen had molested them while trying to free the teachers. They lodged a complaint with Bhowanipore police station. Deputy commissioner (south) Rajesh Subarno said a departmental probe would be conducted. Another officer denied the allegation.

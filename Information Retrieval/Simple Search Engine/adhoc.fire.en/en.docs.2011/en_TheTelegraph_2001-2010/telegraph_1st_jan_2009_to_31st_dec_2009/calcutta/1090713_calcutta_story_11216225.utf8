The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | More hours for traffic police
                                                                                                               More hours for traffic police
          KINSUK BASU                              
	Nearly a third of the 462 deaths in road accidents last year occurred when police were off the road, prompting Lalbazar to consider adding three more hours to its decades-old 7am-to-10pm schedule.        
	Once the new schedule takes effect, traffic police would start their day an hour early at 6am and be on the road till midnight.        
	A team of senior officers has been asked to collate data on road fatalities during the off-duty hours to find out whether some areas need stricter monitoring at certain times of the day or night.        
	Metro had on June 13 visited seven vital  and accident-prone  intersections around town between 5.10am and 6.45am to record how the absence of policing made them perilous.        
	Various factors need to be considered before revising our timings, including the timing of fatal mishaps, said additional commissioner K. Hari Rajan.        
	According to traffic records, 58 people died in accidents on city roads between 10pm and midnight in 2008. Nineteen deaths occurred in accidents between 6 and 7am, and 50 casualties were recorded between midnight and 6 in the morning.         
	A study of area-wise accidents between 10pm and 6am revealed a clear pattern.        
	Accidents on the EM Bypass beyond 10pm accounted for 16 casualties, indicating an increase in the volume of traffic on that road at night and the early hours.        
	With many companies being operational 24x7, the density of traffic on roads at night has gone up. Rash driving is the norm in the absence of traffic management on these roads beyond 10pm, said an official of the traffic and transportation unit of the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority.        
	The majority of fatal mishaps on Strand Road last year occurred either late at night or early in the morning. It is the period when heavy vehicles run riot on that road, said an officer. In south Calcutta, Hastings police station recorded two fatal accidents last year in the 10pm-6am policing-free slot.        
	Four persons died in areas under the jurisdiction of Lake police station between 10 and 11pm. Three road fatalities occurred in Alipore during the same period.        
	There are several roads under the jurisdiction of these police stations where traffic moves at high speed late at night, said a senior officer.         
	Though Lalbazar wants to extend policing hours, manpower is a problem. The force is already stretched, an officer said.        
	According to an official estimate, the citys contingent of 3,500 traffic police personnel needs to be bolstered by at least 54 more officers and 300 constables before the extended schedule can be implemented. Over 1,000 home guards have already been inducted into the traffic police department.         
	Lalbazar is hoping that the government sanctions funds for recruitment soon. Given the fact that the government is desperate to reduce the accident count, the finance departments nod shouldnt be a problem, a source said.

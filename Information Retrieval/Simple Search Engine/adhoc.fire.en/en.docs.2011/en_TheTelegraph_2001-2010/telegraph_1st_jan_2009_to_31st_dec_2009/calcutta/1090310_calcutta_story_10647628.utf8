                      Tribute to Indian womanhood                    It is indeed a daunting notion that one in every six women in the world lives in India. Yet, most people outside the country know little about Indian women. In Daughters of India: Art and Identity, cultural anthropologist, author and photographer Dr Stephen P. Huyler trains his eye on the women of India and sheds light on this multifaceted population. Through engaging story-telling and illuminating photographs, Huyler has profiled 20 women from diverse Indian communities. They represent Everywoman: the traditional and the contemporary, the repressed and the highly innovative, the outcast and the entrepreneur, and from Hindu to Christian to Muslim. The stories, told in the womens own words, express the innate strength they demonstrate in their battles against adversity. Creative expression being the very soul of their existence, these women have carved out a new identity for themselves and have shown how it is possible to bring about a change in the face of all odds. This evening, Beth A Payne, US Consul General in Calcutta, will release the book, to be followed by a presentation by the author. Hosted by Mapin Publishing and Oxford Bookstore.                  Event: Release of Stephen P. Huylers Daughters of India: Art and Identity When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Ramkinkar Baij Sculpture Court, Rabindranath Tagore Centre, ICCR, 9A Ho Chi Minh Sarani

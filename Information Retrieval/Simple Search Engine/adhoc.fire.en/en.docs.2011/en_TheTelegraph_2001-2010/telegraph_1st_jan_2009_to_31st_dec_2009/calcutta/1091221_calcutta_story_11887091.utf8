The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Travel beats slump blues
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Travel beats slump blues
          SANJAY MANDAL                                  Most-favoured destinations            A dragon dance on the Great Wall of China,   north of Beijing      International: Southeast Asia, Dubai, Hong Kong and China      Domestic: Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Port Blair, the Northeast, Rajasthan and Goa      
	Winter travel is back with a bang after having weathered the downturn blues, if the air fares, the highest in the past year, are any indication.        
	The high rate of bookings has pushed up the air fare on some days of this month by almost 100 per cent compared with winter 2008, said Anil Punjabi, the chairman (east) of the Travel Agents Federation of India. Fares are likely to go up further during the Christmas-New Year window. Unlike last year, the fliers are going for premium fares.        
	Last December, homemaker Rupasree Rajagopal had cancelled her family outing to Singapore because she thought it wise not to indulge amidst the global economic slowdown. But things are looking up this year and we have decided to go to Singapore at Christmas, she said.        
	The turnaround in holiday travel can be gauged in the passenger load factor at the city airport which has been around 80 per cent on an average over the past two weeks. It will go up in the coming weeks, said an official. Among the most popular domestic destinations are Delhi, Port Blair, Chennai, Mumbai and Bangalore. The most favoured stops abroad include Bangkok, Singapore and Dubai.        
	The increase in passenger load has prompted Air India to operate special flights to Port Blair, Aizawl and Dimapur during the holiday season. Around 70 per cent of the tickets on most flights have been sold in advance, leading to a rise in fares, a Jet Airways official said.        
	Jet officials said the domestic passenger traffic last month was 33 per cent more compared with November 2008. The airlines international passenger traffic, too, has registered a 19 per cent growth.        
	The current holiday season has been good as we are experiencing healthy load factors out of Calcutta. Ticket prices, however, vary according to the demand, said a Singapore Airlines spokesperson.                                
	According to tour operators, the high demand has pushed up fares. In most sectors, fares have gone up by almost 100 per cent on some days, said a travel agent.         
	Rani Vimala, a private firm executive, had planned a trip to Chennai last Friday. However, the lowest ticket cost Rs 25,000 and so had to cancel the trip, she said. Airline operators warned that as Christmas holiday approaches, the fares would go even further.              
	The airlines domestic and international traffic has been higher compared to last year.              
	There has been a 20 per cent upswing in passenger load out of Calcutta. For the past one month it has been around 80 per cent but in last weeks some sectors have touched nearly 100 percent, said an Air India spokesperson.

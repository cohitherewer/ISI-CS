                                                                                                               Schools close to mourn
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Most city schools will remain closed on Tuesday to pay respect to Subhas Chakraborty, who passed away on Monday morning.         
	All government and state-aided schools are requested to keep the institutions closed on August 4 as a mark of respect to the departed soul of Subhas Chakraborty, read an appeal by the state school education department.         
	Though the appeal was not aimed at private schools, several such institutions decided not to open on Tuesday as a mark of respect to the late transport minister.         
	All Anglo-Indian schools functioning under the Church of North India, such as St James, Pratt Memorial, La Martiniere for Boys, La Martiniere for Girls, all branches of St Thomas School and St Johns Diocesan will remain closed on Tuesday.         
	Subhas Chakraborty supported our cause and always stood by us. The government in its appeal has not mentioned private schools but we have decided to keep all our institutions closed tomorrow as a mark of respect to the departed soul of the minister, said Reverend Ashoke Biswas, the bishop of the Calcutta Diocese of the Church of North India.         
	The Association of the Heads of Indian School Certificate Examinations, an organisation of non-Anglo Indian schools following the ISC/ICSE curricula, has also decided to keep their campuses closed on Tuesday.         
	The heads of private ISC/ICSE schools met soon after the government issued the appeal to all state-aided schools and decided to keep their institutions closed tomorrow, said Sujoy Biswas, the principal of Rammohan Mission School and treasurer of the association.         
	Among the other ISC/ICSE schools that will not open doors on Tuesday are Central Modern School, MP Birla, National Gems and Rishi Aurobindo Institution.         
	Birla High and Lakshmipat Singhania schools are among the CBSE institutions that have decided to follow suit.

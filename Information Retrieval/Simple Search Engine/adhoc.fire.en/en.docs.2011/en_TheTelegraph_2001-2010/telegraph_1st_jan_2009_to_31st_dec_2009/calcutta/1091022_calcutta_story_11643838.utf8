                                                                                                               Sourav school case
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          Sourav Ganguly                                   
	Salt Lake residents have moved Calcutta High Court against alleged violation of official procedures in allotting a 62-cottah plot in CA Block for Sourav Gangulys school project.         
	The Salt Lake CA Block Citizens Association filed a public interest litigation on Wednesday challenging several aspects of the allegedly out-of-turn land allotment.        
	S.K. Mukhopadhyay, the president of the association, pleaded for an injunction against construction till such time the manner in which Sourav got possession of the land was investigated.         
	The former Team India skipper has been made a respondent.        
	The case will come up for hearing before the division bench headed by Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar on October 24, a high court official said.        
	The residents association contended that the urban development department violated its own policy decision (memo number 5607-UD/Y- 7/99) by allotting the 62-cottah plot  CA 222  without publishing an advertisement.         
	The government decision also went against a high court order asking the state to seek its permission before handing over any plot in Salt Lake to an individual or organisation, said Arunava Ghosh, the petitioners counsel.         
	According to the PIL, Sourav requested the state government for the vacant 62-cottah plot after being allotted 50 cottahs in BF Block.        
	The residents association learnt about the alleged irregularities in the second allotment after seeking details of the official process under the Right to Information Act.        
	The joint secretary of the state urban department admitted to the right to information officer that the government did not publish any advertisement before handing over the plot to Sourav Ganguly, which is illegal, said Mukhopadhyay.        
	The official explanation was that the plot in CA Block was allotted to Sourav in lieu of the one that had been handed over to him in BF Block.        
	Mukhopadhyay said the joint secretarys argument did not hold good because his department was the one that had made advertisements mandatory before allotment of plots.

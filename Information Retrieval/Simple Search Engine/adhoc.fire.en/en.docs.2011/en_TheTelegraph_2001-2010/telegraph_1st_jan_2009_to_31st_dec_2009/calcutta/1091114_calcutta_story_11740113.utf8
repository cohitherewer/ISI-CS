          A STAFF REPORTER                          Bhaskar Sarkar. (Gopal Senapati)                                  
	A Class IX student was found hanging in his Bally home on Friday morning, a day after his parents were summoned to school.         
	Bhaskar Sarkars father lodged a police complaint accusing his sons headmaster of mentally torturing the boy and driving him to suicide.         
	Sukesh Kumar Jain, the additional superintendent of Howrah police (town), said a headmaster was within his rights to summon parents to school. If a student commits suicide because his guardian is called to school, the headmaster cannot be held responsible. However, we have started a case on the basis of the complaint, Jain said.         
	The police said Bhaskar, a student of Bally Jodaassathatala High School, was asked by headmaster Kaushik Ghosh to bring his father to school on Friday. Bhaskar and six others had allegedly misbehaved with a teacher on Thursday.         
	Bhaskars father Biswanath said he had told his son that he would not be able to accompany him to school on Friday. Bhaskar insisted I accompany him and not his mother, otherwise the headmaster wouldnt let him sit for an examination. He also said he hadnt misbehaved with the teacher, said Biswanath, who works in a private firm.         
	Bhaskars mother Madhabi said her husband left for work at 8.30am and she went out at 9.40am to bring back their daughter from school. I told Bhaskar I would accompany him to school after returning, she said. Madhabi returned to find her son hanging from the ceiling fan in his room, said an officer.        
	Headmaster Ghosh denied that Bhaskar was mentally tortured or threatened that he would be debarred from taking an exam. I asked him to bring a parent, not his father in particular, Ghosh said.         
	nFound hanging: Sophiya Chatterjee, a student of Class IX, was found hanging in her room in her KD Mukherjee Road home, under Behala police station, on Friday evening. The police suspect it to be a case of suicide.

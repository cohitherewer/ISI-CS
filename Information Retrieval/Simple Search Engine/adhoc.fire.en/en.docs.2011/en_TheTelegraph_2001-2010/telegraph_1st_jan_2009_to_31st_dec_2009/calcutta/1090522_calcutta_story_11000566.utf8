The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Salute from juniors, hero
                                                                                                               Salute from juniors, hero
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	The boy who was inspired by his school to become the highest scorer in the history of the Indian School Certificate (ISC) examination returned to the Bowbazar school on Thursday to inspire the next batches in all-white and grey tie.        
	Subhojit Ghosh of St. Josephs College was drowned in best wishes when he was urged by principal N. McNamara to meet students of the junior section and also their parents.        
	They congratulated me, got themselves photographed with me and some even asked for my autograph, smiled the shy boy who chose to return to school in full uniform.        
	I told them to work hard and they could definitely do better than me.        
	That is a tough act to follow given Subhojits scores of 100 in both math and computer science, 99 in physics, 98 in English, 94 in chemistry, 92 in Bengali and 97 in environmental science.        
	Subhojit, according to his principal, was very focused both when he was studying and when he was not.        
	The ex-prefect and Interact club member was an artist and cartoonist with a flair for creative writing, besides being a member of the Leadership Training Service.        
	He was part of the extra-curricular activities and had beautiful handwriting, said Surupa Duffader, his class teacher from Class VII to X.        
	The 18-year-old all-rounder also played inter-school football and is a fan of Manchester United  though according to his father Subhashish that has less to do with the team and more to do with his football hero, Cristiano Ronaldo.        
	But it was a hero closer home who made the rock music buffs day.        
	The Fossils fan was thrilled to get a congratulatory SMS from the bands frontman Rupam, who got the teen toppers number from Metro.        
	I read about Subhojits achievement in the paper and learnt that he was a fan of Nirvana and Fossils. I felt it was my duty to message him, because he is as much an inspiration for us as our songs are for him, said Rupam.        
	Among all the congratulatory messages he got the day after, this one was special. I immediately replied saying how much I liked the band and how happy I was to have received best wishes from him, said Subhojit, who now hopes to crack IIT and study aerospace engineering.

                                                                            Monday , November 9 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Hope lingers for mishap victim
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Tausif Khan, the young accident victim who was allegedly turned away by five city hospitals on Wednesday night, can yet hope to stand on his feet again.        
	His condition is stable. As of now, the legs need not be amputated as the arteries and nerves have not been irreparably damaged, said Bijoy Adhikary, the managing director of Desun Hospital where Tausif is being treated.        
	Doctors, however, are not ruling out the possibility of complications that might cost the youth his legs. Tausifs left leg from under the knee suffered multiple fractures while the left ankle was smashed. There had been bacterial attack on the wounds as the blood was exposed to external conditions for a long time, said Adhikary.        
	The 22-year-old, an assistant chef in a housing estate club on the Bypass, was knocked down by a vehicle around 10pm on Wednesday. Treatment could start only after 4am on Thursday as the youth was allegedly refused admission by four private and one state-run hospitals. The hospitals had denied the charge.        
	According to critical care specialist Arijit Bose, every minute is crucial to preventing amputation of damaged limbs.        
	At Desun Hospital, doctors on Friday removed dead tissues and skin from Tausifs left leg and fixed exposed bones externally with a steel wire. On Sunday, the right leg was fitted externally with implants.        
	Had the surgery been conducted within the first few hours of the accident, the implants would have been by now fitted internally. Now, internal fixation will have to wait till there is some improvement in the muscle and skin condition, said Adhikary.

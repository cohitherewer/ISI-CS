The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Monsoon mess on arteries 
                                                                                                               Monsoon mess on arteries

	The monsoon showers have yet again left Calcuttas roads in an abysmal condition, exposing the authorities claims of having repaired and strengthened the surface before the rains started. From the EM Bypass to Esplanade, VIP Road to Southern Avenue, craters and potholes dot the road surface. Metro probes the reasons behind the mess              
	Multiple agencies        
	Roads in the city stretch 4,000km, of which main arteries account for 2,200km. Eight agencies, including the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC), Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), public works department and the Calcutta Improvement Trust, are responsible for maintaining the roads.        
	Its a classic case of too many cooks spoiling the broth. The involvement of multiple agencies creates engineering and co-ordination problems. For example, AJC Bose Road is maintained by the civic body while the adjoining approach road to Vidyasagar Setu is under the HRBC, said a CMC engineer.        
	There is no rationale for involving so many agencies for maintaining the city roads, said the civic official.        
	Technique trouble        
	Calcutta roads struggle to handle heavy traffic because of faulty technique of construction and maintenance.        
	A crossing should ideally be surveyed during the peak hour to find out the number of commercial vehicles using the space. Roads should be constructed or re-laid accordingly to bear the traffic load. But this system is not followed in the city, said an official of the CMCs road wing.         
	Many roads still do not have a mastic asphalt coat, which increases durability. According to the civic roads wing, almost 30 per cent of the arteries, including APC Road and Southern Avenue, are awaiting a mastic asphalt surface.         
	The problem with bitumen is that its not water-proof. The surface starts decaying after a few showers, said the civic engineer.         
	Utilities like BSNL and CESC dig up roads to access cables but dont level the surface after completing their work.         
	Maintenance muddle        
	Road maintenance means patchwork in Calcutta. A former CMDA engineer said: The EM Bypass is a case in point. A complete overhaul has not been carried out since the 14km stretch came into existence. The potholes and craters are filled up but the authorities do not repair the area even if the surrounding soil becomes loose. Road surfaces should be periodically peeled off and re-laid.        
	Traffic trauma        
	Very few roads in the city have been widened since Independence. But the number of vehicles has multiplied.        
	Three hundred vehicles per sq km is the limit. But in Calcutta, the number per sq km is nearly 900. Vehicle overload has a major role in damaging the road surface, said an engineer of the traffic and transport wing of the CMDA.

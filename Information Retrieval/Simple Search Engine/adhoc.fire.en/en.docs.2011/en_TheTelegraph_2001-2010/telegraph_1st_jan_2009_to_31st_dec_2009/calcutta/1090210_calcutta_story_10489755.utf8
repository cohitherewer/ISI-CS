The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rs 3 crore to widen chaos corridor
                                                                                                               Rs 3 crore to widen chaos corridor
          DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY                                               Traffic snarls are a daily affair on SC Mullick Road.   A Telegraph picture     
	The entire stretch of Raja SC Mullick Road, from Jadavpur to Garia, should ideally take 10 minutes by car, but a motorist seldom crosses it in less than 30 minutes during peak hours.         
	To ease the flow, the public works department (PWD) has decided to widen the road by 20 to 30 metres. The four-km stretch  between 30 and 40 metres wide  has a university, a medical college, hospitals, schools, malls, residential estates and supermarkets on either side.         
	We have been planning the expansion for a long time as a large number of buses, taxis and autorickshaws ply down the road, said PWD minister Kshiti Goswami.        
	But before work could begin, the PWD had to identify alternative sites for hundreds of shops and a residential building that would have to be razed. We have overcome the problems and I hope work will start soon, Goswami added.        
	Residents say the stretch is a commuters nightmare. The situation is worse at four points  near Jadavpur 8B bus terminus, at Bagha Jatin, at the EM Bypass crossing opposite the route 45 bus terminus and at the four-point crossing in Garia.        
	We wanted to widen the road to 80 feet, but theres wasnt enough space. However, even a 20-metre expansion would help ease the flow, the minister said.         
	About 250 shops and a two-storeyed residential building will have to be demolished for the project, sources said. The shops will be accommodated on the land behind the existing shops or in Ganguly Bagan. The residents of the building will be shifted to Ganguly Bagan or offered compensation.        
	The PWD has sanctioned Rs 3 crore for the project. If everything goes according to schedule, the work will be completed by monsoon.

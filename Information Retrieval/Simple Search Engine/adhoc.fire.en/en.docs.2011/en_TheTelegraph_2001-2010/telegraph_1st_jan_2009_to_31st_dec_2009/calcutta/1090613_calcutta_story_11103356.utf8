The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fire on runway 
                                                                                                               Fire on runway 
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A small fire broke out at one end of the primary runway of the airport around 9.50am on Friday, causing a flight to hover for 10 minutes before landing.        
	The fire probably started from a short-circuit in one of the runway lights and was put out within minutes, said an Airports Authority of India official.        
	The primary runway was closed for regular maintenance from 9am and flights were taking off from and landing on the secondary runway at the time. The United Airlines flight was made to hover for 10 minutes as a precautionary measure before being allowed to land on the secondary runway, said an official.

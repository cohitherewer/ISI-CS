	Green Teens: It was a pleasure to read that schoolchildren have come together to protect trees and remove garbage from various city spots (Teens unite to protect trees, April 20). To make Calcutta clean and beautiful, councillors of all wards must organise Operation ward clean-up involving all residents.   
	A.S. Mehta, New Alipore                               
	I was both amused and bemused at the report Low vigil for high marks, April 14. I am concerned about the quality of education and training being provided to students. I have yet to understand what empowers the authority of a private engineering college to say that the West Bengal University of Technology (WBUT) should not send invigilators during university examinations? Do these colleges forget that the degree is awarded by the university and not by the college?           
	I would like to forward some suggestions to the university:           
	The university should control the internal assessment in colleges too, as this constitutes a large portion in the overall assessment. This can be done by formulating stringent rules, not mere guidelines, for class tests, laboratory work, projects and other assignments. Surprise checks by university officials should be introduced.           
	External examiners should be appointed by the university and not on the basis of a colleges choice. It should be ensured that the external examiners are in no way connected to the college, say, as visiting faculty.           
	Paper setters for the university examinations should be external and not from any college under WBUT. A team of paper setters for each subject should be appointed and the team leader may be appointed as the moderator. In no case, should one person be allowed to be paper setter-cum-moderator.           
	The university should send its officials or representatives to colleges for surprise checks on attendance of students. Certified photocopies of attendance sheets should be demanded by the university at regular intervals from the colleges. The WBUT website may be used for collecting data from the affiliated colleges. Strict measures should be in place for action against defaulters.           
	Head examiners should not be connected to the university or any affiliated college.                     
	P.K. Mukhopadhyay,

	It seems the civic body has solved all problems of the city, and there will be no waterlogging during the monsoon. The only work left is to foray into the hospitality business (CMC debut in hospitality biz, April 22).             
	One wonders at the logic behind such a move, especially when the state government itself opted out of the Great Eastern Hotel imbroglio. Is it at all necessary on the part of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation to get into the hospitality business at a time when civic amenities like water supply, public health, sewage disposal and street lighting are in dismal shape?           
	Second, in the time of economic slowdown, when the hospitality industry is counting its losses, will any sane person bet taxpayers money on that sector?           
	Third, the selection process of a partner for the joint venture is opaque, with no one knowing the basis.           
	Finally, do the civic authorities have the professional skill, manpower and logistics to operate hotels, or are they planning to lease it out to a hotel chain? Do they think running a hotel is childs play?           
	Chameli Pal,
  Batanagar                     
	The CMCs plan to enter the five-star hospitality business will not help the common people. The civic bodys aim should be to ensure better living conditions in Calcutta. The star hotel will be a profitable business if operated efficiently. But should the civic body work for profit?           
	There are various other means to extend hospitality to the people. Many aged people do not get proper care at home. An old-age home may be a good shelter for them. A school for disabled children or a hospital for the poor may also be started to serve people.           
	Dinabandhu Mukherjee, 
  Behala                               
	The report Teen-death docs off rolls, April 29, provided a ray of hope that the doctors who caused teenager Rajnis Patels death would not go unpunished. Although delayed, justice has been delivered, after six long years of wait, with exemplary punishment to two senior surgeons by the West Bengal Medical Council. Natural justice demands that all the five accused doctors be punished with cancellation of their registration numbers. Such callous behaviour strikes at the very root of the confidence reposed on the medical fraternity by people.             
	Dipak Bysack, 
  New Alipore                     
	Apropos School faces closure as funds dry up, April 15, it is shocking that the dreams of the students of a school run by an NGO may be shattered because of lack of central funds. Keeping in mind the background of these children  who come from red-light areas  the ministry of women and child development should provide aid to this school and such institutions. The misplacement of the file relating to the sanction of funds brings out the callousness of the ministry.

	The report Rescued turtles go missing from the zoo, April 17, came as a reminder of how miserably the Alipore zoo is maintained. How can a couple of turtles go missing from an enclosed pool if the zoo staff have been discharging their duties properly?             
	On a recent visit to Alipore zoo, I discovered that the animals were kept in a deplorable condition. The chimpanzees and lions looked malnourished.           
	Ratan Kumar Halder,
  Behala                     
	It was distressing to learn that two rescued turtles gifted to the zoo have gone missing. Since many species of turtles are on the verge of extinction, turtles should not be killed for consumption.           
	Prahlad Agarwala, 
  Majdia, Nadia                               
	It was sad to read about the disturbances at the Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute, for which classes had to be suspended for seven weeks (Why the lights have dimmed at the showpiece film institute, April 16). The long closure will be a great loss for these future film-makers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Maritime varsity opens city campus
                                                                                                               Maritime varsity opens city campus
          A STAFF REPORTER                           A passing-out parade at the Taratala institute. A Telegraph picture                                  
	The Chennai-based Indian Maritime University (IMU) inaugurated its Calcutta wing at the Marine Engineering and Research Institute on Wednesday, providing some solace to the Taratala campus that had resented losing out on the central varsity in 2007.        
	Shipping minister T.R. Baalu had steered the university to his home state, prompting Left MPs to almost come to blows with DMK leaders in the Lok Sabha in March 2007.        
	Given the infrastructure, faculty strength and history of the institute, it should have been the logical choice for housing the university, said Sadhan Kumar Sarkar, the director of the institute.        
	We hope there will be no discrimination between the headquarters and the Calcutta and Mumbai campuses, as all will have the same facilities.        
	Students who enrol with the Taratala institute will register with the maritime varsity from the next academic year. The present students of the four-year BTech course in marine engineering will, however, get their degrees from Jadavpur University.        
	We will try to organise a mass transfer of those who will graduate in 2010, 2011 and 2012 to the IMU so that they get their degrees from the maritime university, said Sarkar.        
	Under the IMU, the Taratala institute will increase its student intake and improve infrastructure to accommodate more courses from the next academic year.        
	The institute will increase the number of seats in the BTech course from 208 to 242 in 2010. We will also have a new six-storey academic complex as well as new hostels on campus, said Sarkar.        
	One of the concerns voiced by the institute when it lost out to Chennai was brain drain. It feared the new courses would only be offered at the IMU headquarters and most of its students would migrate there.        
	But that is no longer a concern, feels the director of the institute. The Calcutta campus of the IMU will also offer a number of courses previously not taught in the country.        
	Our students had to go to the US or the UK to pursue further studies in marine engineering, maritime law or management in shipping and logistics. But now they can study these courses here, said Sarkar.        
	Institutes under the IMU, including the one in the city, will also offer an executive MBA degree as well as a BSc degree in dredging.

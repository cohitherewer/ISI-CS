	Police sealed a mall-cum-multiplex on Gariahat Road on Thursday evening minutes after actress Sonali Bendre inaugurated a restaurant and lounge on the premises.         
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) informed us that it was revoking the completion certificate of the mall. The police went and handed over the notice to the mall authorities, said joint commissioner (headquarters) Jawed Shamim.         
	When Gariahat police reached Mukti World  promoted by Mukti Group  to seal the 9/3 Gariahat Road address near Ballygunge Phari, the launch party for lounge bar Bluzz was in full swing.         
	Mukti World also houses the 8,000sq ft multiplex Movie Time, the eighth in the city that opened in August.         
	Sonali Bendre arrived at the mall around 7pm and formally threw open Bluzz and restaurant Goldbrick. The Bollywood belle said passion and culture were synonymous with Calcutta. But soon after she left the venue, the cops arrived and the party was over.         
	The director-general (buildings) of the CMC revoked the completion certificate. The building and all its operations are now illegal, said a senior officer of Gariahat police station.         
	According to CMC sources, the civic body revoked the completion certificate of the Gariahat Road address after it found out that the top floor of the mall was illegal.         
	However, Raj Kumar Gupta, the managing director of Mukti Group, told Metro the mall had all necessary clearances from the fire department and civic body.         
	The CMC had reservations about a temporary rooftop structure, where we placed fire-fighting equipment. We had got a temporary stay order from the court for Thursdays launch. We will follow all rules, he said.        
	Kamlesh Bhatter of Movie Time said the cops arrived at 7.30pm and they stopped selling tickets. We were allowed to finish the ongoing shows, he said.

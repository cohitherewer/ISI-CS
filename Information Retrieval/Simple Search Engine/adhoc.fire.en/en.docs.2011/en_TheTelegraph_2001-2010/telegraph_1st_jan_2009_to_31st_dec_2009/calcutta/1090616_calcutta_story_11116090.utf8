The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sit-in over water woes
                                                                                                               Sit-in over water woes

	Trinamul Congress councillors staged a sit-in before the mayors chamber at the civic headquarters on Monday to protest water scarcity in various city pockets.         
	We have given 48 hours to the mayor to restore normal supply. If that is not done, we will launch a bigger movement, said Javed Ahmed Khan, the leader of the Opposition in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC).         
	According to the councillors, Kasba, Tiljala, Topsia, Ballygunge, Park Circus, New Alipore, Kalighat and parts of central Calcutta are not getting their regular supply of piped water from the CMC. A delegation led by Khan also met municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay on Monday.        
	We dont know about politics and elections. Our problem is water supply. We used to get filtered surface water from the Kasba booster pumping station in the morning slot. Now we get water only from deep tubewells, which is unfit for cooking, said Swapna Ghosh, a resident of VIP Bazar.         
	The scarcity has drilled holes into the civic bodys claim that Calcutta is a water-surplus city. According to civic estimates, the daily water demand in the CMC-serviced areas is 294 million gallons, while the combined supply from the CMCs Palta, Garden Reach, Jorabagan and Watgunge plants is 360 million gallons.         
	The mayor blamed the temporary shortfall of 50 million gallons on the heat and power cuts at booster stations.

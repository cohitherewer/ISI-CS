	Tradition and trend were the diverse draws in town this weekend.        
	If the citys fashion frat flocked to ITC The Sonar Calcutta for a date with style and stars, thousands thronged Netaji Indoor Stadium for a tryst with mythology.        
	If all eyes were on the 24-year-old saffron-robed Shri Radhakrishnaji Maharaj at the Bhagwat Katha, eye-candy in every colour (but often not quite robed) was the calling card at the Kolkata Fashion Week II.        
	For every Mallishree Dhoot, 27, who chose the stadium over the star hotel, there was a Shakuntala Jain, in her 50s, who headed for the Bypass instead. For every Arijit Basu, 30, desperate to catch the Manish Malhotra show, there was Shrikumar Mundhra, 62, for whom the GenX guru narrating tales of Krishna was not to be missed.        
	With elderly homemakers and college-goers scrambling in their chiffons and zardosis for entry cards at the chock-a-block stadium, the organisers of the Bhagwat Katha were struggling to contain the turnout on Sunday afternoon. I have helped organise many events in Calcutta but never have I witnessed such a huge turnout, not even for Dandiya nights, said Sundeep Bhutoria, one of the patrons.        
	The organisers of KFW II were thrilled with the crowd count at their five-day show, peaking with the Sunday finale. The package of top designers, good models and starry showstoppers made it a success, said Yudhajit Dutta of Mindscape Maestros. There was a real craze for passes.              
	Around 4,000 managed to watch the fashion shows every day, with hundreds more desperate for a ramp-side view. Around 15,000 managed to get into the stadium, with hundreds more desperate for a glimpse of the young Maharaj made famous by TV.

	Many in the crowd had chosen this over that. Take Mallishree Dhoot, who wouldnt trade her last row seats at the stadium for a fashion week pass. I had offers from friends to go for KFW but I chose the Bhagwat Katha. It was a good experience, said the young professional.        
	Shakuntala Jain, designer Anamika Khannas mother, though, gave a thumbs-up to trend over tradition. KFW shows me something new to keep myself updated.        
	If Bhaichung Bhutia or Neil Nitin Mukesh drew cheers and gasps on the KFW ramp on Sunday, a showstopper of a different kind was weaving his magic in another part of town. As Radhakrishnaji Maharaj sang and danced and narrated excerpts from Bhagwat Katha, the crowds clapped and sang along.        
	It was wonderful, gushed Neelam Mohta, a 30-year-old homemaker who was a front-row regular on all three days with family and friends.        
	Her namesake, a 22-year-old star-struck fashion fan was as gushing about her weekend at KFW. The fashion week was mind-blowing. It was the place to be for all those hooked on to fashion and films.        
	For once, the city had something for everyone this weekend.

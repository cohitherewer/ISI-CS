                      Magic of pottery                    Pottery is fast becoming popular with todays creative youth, just as it used to be with the artisans of yesteryear. An interesting group of progressive-minded potters has recently formed an organisation called Clay Stories, which will evolve into a platform for potters, craftsmen, artists and art enthusiasts  who will meet and exchange ideas, concepts and enrich their creative endeavours. It hopes to cement a professional relationship with potters across the country as well as all over the world through workshops, seminars, film shows and other media-based dispersible concepts to help develop the profession with scientific and technological assistance, sourcing of raw material, spreading knowledge and so on. Its ongoing maiden event is a collaboration of contemporary and traditional potters that will eventually connect with the national and international potters forum. A concept implemented with the help of Crafts Council of West Bengal, it has on display a colourful variety of lamps, teapots, mugs, cups, candle-holders, incense-stick stands and others household accessories ranging from the rustic to the modern. The show is expected to showcase studio pottery of amazing quality in a demonstration-sale ambience and, over time, to encourage the passing on of experience, improved technology and equipment to rural craftsmen, in order to make the craft more sophisticated and inject fresh life and enthusiasm among artisans.

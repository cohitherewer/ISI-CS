The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Police pay cut for Aila fund
                                                                                                               Police pay cut for Aila fund
          KINSUK BASU                                            
	Donations for the Aila victims were deducted from the salaries of city policemen without their consent after the commissioner issued a notice specifying how much each cop should voluntarily contribute to the chief ministers welfare fund.        
	The notice by top cop Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti, published in Kolkata Police Gazette dated May 28, mentioned amounts between Rs 15 to Rs 1,500 that employees from constable to commissioner were to donate for relief and rehabilitation of those affected by the cyclone.         
	The collected amount would be handed over to the chief ministers welfare fund. While this financial help is purely optional, one hopes all the staff of Calcutta police would co-operate spontaneously towards this noble endeavour, the notice reads.        
	After finding the amounts deducted from their salaries for May, officers of various departments questioned the legality of the procedure.         
	As far as I know, only the governor can order salary deductions. Why was Rs 50 deducted from my salary without my consent? asked a sub-inspector of the Reserve Force.        
	The commissioner should not have specified how much I was to donate. I would probably have donated more than Rs 50 on my own, he added.        
	According to cops, there have been murmurs of discontent in all the departments of the Lalbazar police headquarters and the 48 police stations across the city since the notice became public but few are ready to protest officially.        
	Most officers felt Chakrabarti only needed to ask the cops to donate generously, as is usually done in such situations.        
	We have donated for disaster relief and other causes several time in the past. The way amounts have been specified for donation is unthinkable, said Pradip Sarkhel, the general secretary of the State Government Employees Federation at Lalbazar.

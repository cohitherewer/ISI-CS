The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Challenged call for poll facilities
                                                                                                               Challenged call for poll facilities
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Disability rights activists came together in the city on Thursday to highlight the problems faced by the physically challenged in casting votes and demand a system more friendly to them.        
	There are rules to allow the over 21.9 million physically challenged citizens (two per cent of the population) to exercise their franchise but they are seldom enforced, the activists said. We have to fight to get acts formulated to protect our basic rights. We have to then fight legal battles to ensure implementation of the acts and policies. There is still no action, said Sujata Parekh, the president of Disability Activists Forum, one of the NGOs that took part in Thursdays programme.        
	Physically challenged voters want polling booths on the ground floor, ramps at the entrance and electronic voting machines at a height of 3ft for the benefit of people in wheelchairs.        
	In case a polling booth is above the ground floor, there should be provision to carry wheelchairs to it. Stretchers should not be used instead. Most importantly, the Centre and the Election Commission in their messages should ask the physically challenged to cast their votes, added Parekh.        
	Saswati Acharya, a wheelchair-bound activist in her 30s, cited her own experience. When she went to vote for the first time shortly after turning 18, two men offered to carry her to the booth.         
	She returned without casting her vote. I have never tried to vote again. I dont want to vote at the cost of my dignity, she told Metro.        
	The Election Commission, in October 2007, had issued a guideline calling polling personnel to allow the physically challenged to cast their vote before others and help wheelchair-bound voters reach their booths.

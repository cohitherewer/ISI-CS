The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A Holi photoshoot
                                                                                                               A Holi photoshoot
										      CALEIDOSCOPE                        Foreigners outside the Indian Museum on Holi-eve. Picture by Sudeshna Banerjee                City shutterbug Debasish Chatterjee clicked this red-eyed dove at his Kankurgachhi home, marvelling that such a beautiful creature is still seen in the land of noxious auto fumes and disappearing greens				                           
	On the eve of Holi, Indian Museum hosted Vasanta Utsav to celebrate the colours of spring. All visitors to the museum in the days preceding the event  especially those from outside India  were invited to the open-to-all affair at the museum garden.         
	A smattering of curious foreigners landed up at the venue. On their heels came a host of photographers hopeful of clicking a few Holi-specials. But instead of a full-blown play of colours, what awaited them were the strains of Indian classical music being played live.         
	The only spot of colour in the evening was a demure tilak of abir that a lady on duty at the entrance was putting on the foreheads of visitors. Not to be outdone, the photographers caught hold of the lady, persuaded a few fair visitors and orchestrated a photo session.         
	The visitors took the impromptu photoshoot in a playful spirit till a stern hand, thrust out by a museum staffer, blocked the viewfinders.         
	The photographers left in a hurry, leaving the actors in the sequence to say their first hellos to each other.         
	Arbel and Hila Altschuler, students from Israel, had caught enough of the action to figure out what the Holi game was all about. Yes, we will go out tomorrow and expose ourselves to the play of colours on the streets. Today I was afraid for my camera, Arbel smiled, putting a protective hand over his bag, sporting sprinklings of red abir, which had also transformed the colour of his bearded face.        
	Safe bet        
	Shopping for Holi can be as eventful as the festival itself. Appalled by newspaper reports about toxins in Holi colours, a young woman decided to go herbal this year.         
	Her first stop was a stall at Garia More. She asked for safe colours and was offered a small pack of a buff-coloured substance costing Rs 30, manufactured by an educational institute. The colour was far from encouraging  not to mention the price.         
	The woman moved on to the next shop and asked for floral colours. The shopkeeper confidently handed over a small green cardboard box that didnt have floral written anywhere on it. As she eyed the box suspiciously, the shopkeeper tried to be helpful. Didi, ekbar lagaben, aar chharbe na (Once you apply this colour, it wont wash off).         
	Taken aback, she asked Eta floral? Phul theke banano (Is this made from flowers)? Now it was the shopkeepers turn to be surprised. The woman picked up a packet of pink abir that she buys every year and went home.

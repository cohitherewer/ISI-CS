	It was a day to look back at the years past for the Xaverians from all walks of life who came together at the St Xaviers Collegiate School grounds on December 19 to celebrate the 32nd reunion of Alumnorum Societas (ALSOC), the schools old boys association.         
	Recalled Kaushik Basu, the chief economic adviser to the finance ministry, who was also the chief guest for the evening: I began as a not-so-good student, but the school developed the thirst for knowledge in me. Attributing his success to those early years, he added: It made me what I am today.         
	The other guests included Father provincial George Pattery, Rector Father George Ponodath, principal and president of ALSOC Father Jerome Francis, vice-principal Father Sebastian James, president emeritus Father Bruylants and Father Felix Raj, the principal of St Xaviers College.              St Xaviers College (Calcutta) Alumni Association (SXCCAA), on behalf of its alma mater, unveiled a 30ft statue of Santa Claus, the tallest in town, on Park Street on the morning of December 19 as a part of the 150 years celebration of St Xaviers, as well as its own silver jubilee celebrations. The mobile Santa was inaugurated at the Park Street and Free School Street crossing (near The Tea Table) and later moved to Allen Park for the Christmas celebrations.   It will spread the message of love, peace and harmony, which are of utmost importance at this hour, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, who, along with the principal of the college Father Felix Raj, unveiled the statue.   The statue will remain at its present location till   January 2, after which it will be moved to various parts of the city as a message of peace to the people, especially the younger generation.

	It was in Class VIII C under Mr Vienna that the world of knowledge became interesting. Mathematics as a subject opened up under Mr Bhowmick in Class XI, said Basu.        
	Ex-students also joined current students to sing the school anthem and shake a leg with old mates. A film about the history of the college, a light-and-sound event and a sumptuous feast drew the reunion to a close.        
	We wanted it to be more than a party. So we chose some meaningful projects to repay our debt to society, said Noomi Mehta, the honourary secretary of ALSOC.        
	These included contributions to the alma mater, including renovation of the prefects room, staff rooms, senior school toilets, conducting clinics, endowing scholarships and running schools for the underprivileged.        
	Next on the charts for ALSOC is the construction of the fifth floor of the primary school building. The members are currently working to install an elevator on the senior school premises.        
	We will also add around 4,500sq ft at the Bagi village school for underprivileged girls in South 24-Parganas that ALSOC has been supporting, said Mehta.        
	Inspired by the 1986 batchs gift of Rs 2 crore to their teachers on November 14, ALSOC has decided to set up a fund of Rs 10 crore for the school.

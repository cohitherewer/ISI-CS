The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Stench torment for school students 
                                                                                                               Stench torment for school students 
          ZEESHAN JAWED                          The garbage dump opposite St Saviours Tamil Church School                                  
	For nine-year-old Anshul Tiwary, the time spent inside the classroom in summer is tortuous. The high temperature causes him to sweat profusely, making his shirt stick to his skin. But the windows cannot be opened because of a bigger menace.         
	Right in front of the two-storey school building  less than 10 metres away  lies a huge vat filled with garbage, giving off an unbearable stench.        
	Since Anshul joined St Saviours Tamil Church School, off Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road, five years ago, he has always found the wooden windows of the classrooms shut.         
	If we open the windows, we wouldnt be able to stand here for a minute, leave alone teach the children, said Anshuls class teacher. While entering and leaving the school, students have to cover their noses, she said.         
	According to the school authorities, the vat  measuring around 10ft x 15ft  is used by at least five neighbouring wards. As a result, it overflows with garbage at any point of the day, releasing an overpowering stink.         
	Principal Mohan Raj said he had sent repeated complaints to the civic authorities but his pleas fell on deaf ears. He later decided to keep all the doors and windows of the classrooms closed to minimise the stench and protect the 500-odd students of the school.         
	I have been fighting this battle since 2000, when I joined as the principal. I have written to all the authorities possible but nobody has shown any interest in helping the school. How can such a vat exist in front of a school where kids study? Raj asked.         
	When approached by the school authorities, local councillor Iqbal Ahmed asked them to identify an alternative site for the vat. It is not the responsibility of the school to locate land for vats. The civic body should be doing this, said Raj.        
	To add insult to injury, the hand-pulled carts used to gather garbage from households are kept in front of the main gate of the school. There is no other place to keep the carts, said a municipal worker.         
	The foul smell and the unhealthy environment at the school are telling on the students health. Parents say the kids remain morose even after returning home. A number of kids are suffering from concentration disorders and depression. Many keep falling ill, said a teacher of the school.

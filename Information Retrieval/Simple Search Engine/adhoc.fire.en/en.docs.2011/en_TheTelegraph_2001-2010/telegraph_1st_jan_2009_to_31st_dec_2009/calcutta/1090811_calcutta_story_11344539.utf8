The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Zoo director suspended
                                                                                                               Zoo director suspended
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Alipore zoo director Subir Kumar Chowdhury was suspended on Monday in connection with the theft of eight rare monkeys, called Common Marmosets.         
	We have suspended Alipore zoo director S.K. Chowdhury on the basis of a preliminary probe into the theft of the rare monkeys from the zoo. He will remain suspended pending a detailed inquiry, said K.S. Rajendra Kumar, the principal secretary in the department of forest.         
	Chowdhury refused to comment on his suspension. I am shocked and cannot say anything on the decision, he said.        
	The joint director of the Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve, Raju Das, will take over as the zoo director.         
	Sources said senior officials in the forest department decided on Chowdhurys suspension after discussing the matter with minister Ananta Ray. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, too, was informed about the punitive action before it was announced.         
	Officials at Writers Buildings said a report submitted by police to the home secretary on Monday pointed at loopholes in the zoos security.         
	There is no fool-proof security in the compound which is home to several rare and endangered animals. The zoo authorities failed to learn any lesson even after foiling an attempt to steal a Common Marmoset in March, said a senior officer at Lalbazar.         
	Two zoo guards were arrested on Monday morning in connection with the theft, which came to light early on Sunday, even as the detective department took over the probe from Watgunge police station.         
	Ashok Patra and Shyam Sunder Ghosh were arrested following incongruities in their statements. A preliminary probe hints at the involvement of some insiders in the theft of the Brazilian monkeys, said an officer.         
	Ashok, who was on duty from 10pm on Saturday to 6am on Sunday, was assigned the task of keeping a watch on the enclosure from where the tiny mammals went missing. Shyam had guarded the same enclosure from 5pm on Saturday till Ashoks shift started.         
	A private agency is responsible for the zoos security. The agency deploys 34 guards daily  20 from 9am to 5pm and 14 from 10pm to 6am. In the intervening period, the enclosures are looked after by zoo employees who are not trained guards. There is also no surveillance on the guards from the private agency, said a police officer.         
	For the Marmoset enclosures, the private guards are deployed round-the-clock except for three hours  from 6am to 9am         
	The police conducted raids in several places throughout Monday in search of the stolen monkeys. We are keeping a close watch on all entry and exit points of the city, the officer said.         
	The zoo, spread across 45 acres, houses 1,270 birds, 231 mammals and 66 reptiles.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Puja peeves: rules amp; prices   In a flap, cops to identify flout pandals
                                                                                                               Puja peeves: rules amp; prices     In a flap, cops to identify flout pandals
  - HEIGHT OF AUDACITY          OUR BUREAU                          The pandal at Sealdahs Santosh Mitra Square, modelled on the Statue of Liberty, is at least 70ft high, from the base to the tip of the flame. The governments Puja guidelines, turned into a judicial verdict by the high court on Tuesday, state that pandals must not be more than 40ft high. Congress councillor Pradip Ghosh, associated with the puja since inception, however asserted that the court ruling was not applicable to pandals in parks.

	Police will fan out from Thursday to spot pandals violating the court-approved guidelines, but what they will do after that is a Puja puzzle.        
	We will have to follow the court order in toto, joint commissioner (headquarters) Jawed Shamim said, but sources at Lalbazar pointed out several grey areas that needed to be sorted out before firming up a plan of action against puja violators.        
	We have no clue what rules to follow while taking action against puja committees that are violating the court directive. Will the offence be treated as bailable or non-bailable? Do we have to demolish the pandals that have not left 4 feet open on all four sides or are more than 40ft high? Unless these questions are answered there is little we can do even after identifying the violators, an officer said, requesting anonymity.        
	Senior officers of the city police went into a huddle on Wednesday to discuss ways to enforce Tuesdays ruling of the high court but no concrete plan emerged.        
	It was, however, decided that the five divisional deputy commissioners would ensure that a copy of the ruling reached all 1,125 puja committees by Wednesday night.        
	From Thursday, officers of all 48 police stations in the city would inspect pandals in their respective areas to find out whether they are abiding by the court ruling, said an officer.        
	The inspection teams will mainly focus on whether the pandals have left 4ft space all around. This is the only addition to the list of guidelines, the rest have been in place for years, the officer added.         
	Sources said that once the inspection was over, senior officers would consult legal experts on the steps to be taken against the violators.        
	The officers, however, are willing to hear out puja committees about the problems in abiding by the court order with just a week to go for Puja, they said.        
	But what options does an inconvenienced resident or commuter have if the cops fail to act on the court order?        
	Since the original petition (filed by a Kasba resident against RK Chatterjee Road Adhibasi Brinda) has been disposed of, residents cannot move court directly against any errant organiser, said lawyer Supradip Roy.        
	They will have to first lodge a police complaint against a puja committee. Only if the police sit on the complaint can they move court.        
	Can the high court take suo motu action against violators? The court has discretionary power to act suo motu but judges usually pass orders only on the basis of specific complaints, said a lawyer.        
	Advocate Jayanta Narayan Chatterjee said the police can be prosecuted for contempt of court if they were found to have ignored any complaint of violation. The court can also ask the police to cancel the permission to a puja if the pandal flouts the norms.        
	Several government empanelled lawyers, however, said that with two days to go for Mahalaya, it would be impossible to ensure that the big pandals remained within the height limit of 40 feet.

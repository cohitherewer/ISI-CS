	Nemai Ghoshs photography exhibition on Satyajit Ray to mark the first anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore Centre, ICCR. Picture by Aranya Sen Times Square in New York by city shutterbug Asis Sanyal, exhibited at Gaganendra Pradarsasala this week along with the works of 10 other amateur photographers belonging to Photo Club Kolkata. The club was set up by the photography enthusiasts on August 19, 2006, World Photography Day    
	Rabindranath Tagore Centre has arrived on the cultural map of Calcutta, feels Virendra Gupta, the director-general of the Indian council for cultural relations (ICCR), at the centres first anniversary celebrations on Wednesday.     
	Gupta described the centre as one of the best in the country. We have a centre in Delhi, but not such an extensive facility, he said.     
	The ICCR facility on Ho Chi Minh Sarani boasts an auditorium, conference centre, souvenir shop, exhibition spaces, art galleries, an atrium and the Cafe The. We also have small spaces where people can meet for small events, said Reba Som, the director of the centre.     
	The auditorium has held over a hundred events in the past year, of ICCR and other organisations. We hire out the auditorium for events. As part of the first anniversary celebrations, we have also launched a website with information to make it easier for those who want to hire our space, said Som.     
	The director is happy with the way the centre has been received by the city. The capacity of the auditorium is 275, but for certain events we have had 400 people coming in. Seminars like the one on Gabriel Garcia Marquez were very well received, said Som.     
	The centre wants to foster local talent. The aim is not only to get international performers here, but to create a space for Indian artistes abroad. There is a revived interest in Indian culture abroad, and we look upon our regional centres to help us locate regional talent, said Gupta.     
	The activities of the centre form a part of ICCRs overall expansion plans. We have 20-23 centres abroad and we are looking to double that figure. We are planning centres in Bangladesh, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Paris, Brazil, the US, West Asia, Africa and China, said Gupta.

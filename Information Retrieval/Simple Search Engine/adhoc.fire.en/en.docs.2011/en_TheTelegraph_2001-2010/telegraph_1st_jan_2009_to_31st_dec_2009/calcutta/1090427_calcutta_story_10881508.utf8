                      Picture stories                    A fairly old art form in comparison with modern developments in digital and computer-based art, photography is also in a continuously evolving mode. Though interplay of light and shade is considered to be the highlight of any work of photography, recent technological developments have opened up new areas of expertise and specialisation in this form of art. Nevertheless, purists still swear by the fundamentals of analog photography. Be it nature, still life, portraits or any other subject, it is the photographers sense of sight, perception and perspective that helps him to create his work of art. The ongoing seventh annual exhibition of Association of Freelance Photographers and Art Pictorialists presents a diverse collection which art lovers will appreciate for its content, style and theme. Featuring works by 10 photographers, its showcases an exciting mix that arouses feelings of awe, wonder, fear, passion and even pity. While some of the photographs on show are thematically rich, the others deserve merit for their technical excellence. Most important, each one has a story to tell; about life and what lies beyond it, about work and worship, about human nature and relationships.

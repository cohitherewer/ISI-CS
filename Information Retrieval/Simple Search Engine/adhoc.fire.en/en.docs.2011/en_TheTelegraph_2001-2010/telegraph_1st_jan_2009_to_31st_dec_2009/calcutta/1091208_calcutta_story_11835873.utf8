          ONTHESPOT - GUARDIANS SHELTER                          The shelter for guardians in front of Sri Aurobindo Bal Mandir School in New Alipore. Picture by Talat Salahuddin                                  
	Mothers of schoolchildren are often found sitting on sidewalks or on verandahs, waiting to take back their wards home once school gives over. A neglected lot, they are often shooed away by landlords or have to brave the sun or rain.         
	In a bid to help such guardians, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) recently constructed a covered shelter in New Alipore complete with benches for parents to wait for their children.         
	The brainchild of Trinamul Congress MLA Aroop Biswas, the construction was funded from Mamata Banerjees MP Local Area Development (MPLAD) allotment and the stop is now a popular destination not just for mothers but also pedestrians and senior citizens of the area.        
	Mothers like Tapasi Hazra of Budge Budge, Banani Ganguly from Behala and Rinku Karmakar from Garden Reach earlier had to stand on the pavement of Promotho Chowdhury Sarani in front of Sri Aurobindo Bal Mandir School. With the new stop for guardians, they now organise picnics every week while waiting for their children.        
	The guardians stop is a sprawling, roofed enclosure that seats about 90 people. Complete with portraits of Tagore, Mother Teresa, C.V. Raman and Kazi Nazrul Islam, it provides the right ambience and facilities, including a pay-and-use toilet nearby. Constructed at a cost of Rs 9 lakh under the supervision of chief engineer of borough X, Kartik Ghosh, it is a cement and iron structure that has been painted to give a wooden finish.         
	It is a pleasure for us to take our children to school now. The stop has helped forge a bond among the guardians who wait here. However, there is just one thing missing, drinking water, said Vidya Bhowmik.        
	In November, Aroop Biswas handed over the stop to the principal of Sri Aurobindo Bal Mandir School, Chitra Basu. The school authorities have agreed to maintain the stop since it benefits mostly the mothers who come to the school with their children.         
	The stop is the second such shelter in Biswass ward. The popularity of the first one at the crossing of Nalini Ranjan Avenue and Majherhat bridge made me go ahead with this one, he said.

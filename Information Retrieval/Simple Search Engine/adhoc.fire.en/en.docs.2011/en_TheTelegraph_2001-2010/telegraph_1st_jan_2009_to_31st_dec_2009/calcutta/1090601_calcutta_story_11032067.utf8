The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Delhi boost for Besu upgrade plan
                                                                                                               Delhi boost for Besu upgrade plan
          ANASUYA BASU                                    
	Bengal Engineering and Science University is back on Delhis radar with a new government being formed and the HRD ministry writing to the authorities for a revised budget that takes into account a larger salary bill.        
	We have received a letter asking for a budget revision in view of the 11th Pay Commissions recommendations. I will visit the HRD ministry with the required documents soon, said vice-chancellor Ajay Kumar Ray.        
	Sources said Ray was scheduled to leave for the capital in about a week.        
	Besu has long been awaiting an upgrade, as recommended by the Anandakrishnan Committee, but student unrest has stalled the process. As and when the plan is implemented, the university will become an Indian Institute of Engineering, Science and Technology, a group of technical institutes on a par with the IITs.        
	Prior to the elections, former HRD minister Arjun Singh had sent a formal regret letter to Bengal governor and chancellor Gopalkrishna Gandhi citing student unrest as the reason why Delhi had shelved the plan to upgrade the 150-year-old institution.        
	According to vice-chancellor Ray, Besu is putting its best foot forward now that Delhi has shown interest in reviving the upgrade plan. The first step towards staking claim to the status of an institute of national importance has been to restore the academic environment on the campus.         
	Ray has also set the ball rolling for administrative reforms on the lines of those implemented by the IITs. The list includes examination-related reforms and changes in the PhD rules and regulations.         
	The academic schedule is now being strictly adhered to at all costs, said the vice-chancellor.        
	All examination results were declared by May 15, after which the university went into recess. The break ends on June 15.        
	We have encouraged the faculty to take up academic research in a major way during the recess. The thrust is on sponsored research, said the vice-chancellor.         
	The electronics department of Besu has already bagged a Rs 1-crore project in collaboration with CESC on developing Internet signal communication through power lines. A Rs 7-crore project from the ministry of steel is also coming the metallurgy and material science departments way, department head N.R. Bandopadhyay said.        
	Besu will shortly introduce MS-cum-PhD programmes in line with those in IISC Bangalore. As many as 12 government scholarships will be provided, with each session beginning in July.

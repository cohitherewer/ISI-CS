The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Roadblock over school fee hike
                                                                                                               Roadblock over school fee hike
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Nearly 500 guardians of students of Nava Nalanda High School blocked Southern Avenue for more than three hours on Friday to protest a hike in tuition and other fees.        
	Guardians of students from all the schools wings assembled outside the gate of the main compound around noon and demanded that the authorities discuss the hike with them. Around 1.30pm they allegedly broke open the gate and entered the premises.        
	The guardians later put up a roadblock, which caused severe traffic snarls on Gariahat Road, Rashbehari Avenue, SP Mukherjee Road and Sarat Bose Road. The guardians claimed that the tuition fees had gone up by 40 per cent, the development fees had doubled from Rs 1,100 and the session charges had been raised from Rs 4,000 to Rs 5,000.        
	The authorities said they had been forced to raise the fees to pay the enhanced salaries of teachers and other employees, as recommended by the Fifth Pay Commission.        
	The guardians alleged that the authorities had announced steep hikes in development and session fees despite the school having poor infrastructure.        
	Classes are held under tarpaulin shades. None of the school buildings have a proper toilet for students. The school has no right to raise tuition fees, said a guardian.        
	We have tried to lessen the burden on the guardians by allowing them to pay the session fees in instalments. We have met the guardians and are taking into account some of the issues raised by them, said Arijit Mitra, the rector.        
	The roadblock was lifted around 4.30pm after the authorities promised to meet the guardians on Monday.

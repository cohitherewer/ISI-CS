          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 22-year-old Salt Lake resident was arrested on Wednesday night for allegedly passing on another persons credit card details to a travel agency that bought air tickets worth Rs 70,000 online with the information.        
	Dekhawat Pandey, who lives in BE block, had allegedly stolen the credit card particulars of Runa Ganguly, a resident of CB block. The bank that issued the card called to inform her about the online transaction. Her husband Sumanta, a senior executive with an MNC, blocked the card and lodged a complaint with police.        
	Three elderly passengers who flew to Bangalore on tickets bought using the card details were detained for questioning there.        
	They claimed they were innocent and blamed a travel agent who had got them the tickets just four hours before the flight and that too at a discount. We arrested Pandey subsequently, said an investigator.        
	Sumanta said the credit card information could have been stolen from a shop in CF block from which Runa had recently bought a cellphone.        
	Murder suspects: A woman and her husband were arrested on Thursday for allegedly murdering her sister Soma Bhattacharya in her house at Unique Park, Behala. Police suspect the two had killed the spinster to grab her property.         
	PTTI arrests: Nine former students of the primary teachers training institutes (PTTIs) were arrested on Thursday after a group of 40 entered Bikash Bhavan in Salt Lake, climbed to the fifth floor office of primary education minister Partha De and started agitating. The six former students of the institutes arrested after Wednesdays demonstration have been remanded in jail for seven days.

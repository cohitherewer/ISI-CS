                                                                                                               Chill pill for exam fever

	Exam fever is raging and city schools are reaching out to students with tips to beat last-minute jitters.        
	From creating a dedicated email ID for answering anxious queries to organising counselling sessions and workshops on stress and time management, the schools are lending a helping hand to students in testing times.        
	Madhyamik starts on Wednesday while the ICSE, ISC and CBSE exams begin early next week. Around nine lakh students will write the tests.        
	We have been answering the students queries through icseexpertsforyourediffmail.com. The email ID was created two weeks ago and has received overwhelming response, said Richard Gasper, the academic inspector of St Augustine group of schools.        
	An ICSE examinee from one of the St Augustine schools had asked: Five days are left for the exams but I am yet to revise Bengali (second language)... I fear failing in the subject. What should I do?        
	The school authorities advised the child to concentrate on the other subjects as according to ICSE rules, one can pass even after failing in the second language.        
	Schools are organising interactive sessions with psychological counsellors and other experts for students feeling the board exam blues.        
	An official of a south Calcutta school said the students queries range from what to do if the subjects are not properly revised to which pens are best suited for writing answers. The most common query is how to overcome fear.        
	We keep telling the children that exams are not the end of life. They should go through with it without worrying about others expectations, said Noel Nyss, an expert dealing with students of various schools.        
	Schools such as St James, Pratt Memorial, St Thomas, Welland Gouldsmith and Julien Day have hosted a series of sessions focusing on stress and time management over the past two months.        
	Students have been repeatedly asked not to lose their cool even in trying circumstances, said St James principal Terence Ireland.        
	We are trying to explain to our students that exams are not just about burning the midnight oil but also about what they eat and how they dress, said Malini Bhagat, the principal of Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School.

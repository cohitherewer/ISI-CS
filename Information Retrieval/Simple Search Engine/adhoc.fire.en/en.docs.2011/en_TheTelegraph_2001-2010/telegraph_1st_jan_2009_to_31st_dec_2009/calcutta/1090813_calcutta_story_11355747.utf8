The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | The City Diary
                                                                                                               The City Diary
                Railway minister Mamata Banerjee will inaugurate the Tollygunge-Garia stretch of Metro Railway on August 22 instead of August 23. The inauguration was brought forward because finance minister Pranab Mukherjee would not have been able to attend the programme on August 23.     A Class VIII student of Alipore Boys and Girls School, Joseph Shubhashis Mondol, was diagnosed with swine flu and quarantined at Beleghata ID Hospital on Wednesday. The Alipore resident, who is the 13th swine flu patient in the state, had been taken to the hospital on Tuesday. His swabs were collected but hospital staff sent him home. He was admitted to the hospital after tests confirmed swine flu.    Power supply may be affected in some north Calcutta pockets on Thursday between 10am and 12.30pm because of maintenance work at CESCs Sinthee distribution centre. Galiff Street, Raja Dinendra Street, Manomotho Ganguly Road, Ultadanga Road, Dum Dum Station Road and South Sinthee are likely to be affected. The utility will resort to rotational loadshedding in parts of the city from August 14 to 16 because of some work on high-tension overhead lines.    Subhash Majumdar, 40, was arrested at Calcutta airport on Wednesday for allegedly misbehaving with an airhostess on a Jet Airways flight from Bangkok. Sources said Majumdar appeared to be drunk.

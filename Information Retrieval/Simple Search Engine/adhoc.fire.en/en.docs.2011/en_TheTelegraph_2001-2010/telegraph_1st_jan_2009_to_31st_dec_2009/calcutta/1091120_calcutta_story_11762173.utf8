	A 17-year-old found dead beside rail tracks between Baidyabati and Bhadreswar was identified on Thursday as a Class XII student accused of raping a minor girl.         
	Sishendu Halders head was smashed and his body had several bruises, indicating that he fell off or was pushed off a speeding train, said cops.         
	The teenager was living at his uncles place in Uttarpara after being granted bail in June on the condition that he would not return to Panditiya Road, where the girl he allegedly raped was his neighbour.        
	Sishendu, whose father is a driver, cleared his Class X board exam from a reputable English-medium school in south Calcutta.        
	He was arrested in April on the basis of a complaint lodged by the girls father and spent two months in a juvenile home in Ariadaha, said an officer of Seoraphuli Government Railway Police (GRP).        
	Sishendus uncle Samar Dey said the teenager had left their Uttarpara home around 9am on Wednesday. Residents noticed the body beside the tracks and informed employees of Baidyabati railway station. Seoraphuli GRP personnel sent the body for post-mortem. A notebook with a few telephone numbers was found in Sishendus pocket, said Samar.        
	Sishendus father Pradip alleged foul play but did not lodge a complaint with police.

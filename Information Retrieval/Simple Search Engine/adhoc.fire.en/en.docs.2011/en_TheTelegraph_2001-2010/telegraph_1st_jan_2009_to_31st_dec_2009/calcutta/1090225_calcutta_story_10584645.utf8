	Blame the end-February heat on a low pressure trough that has been sucking in moisture from the Bay of Bengal, Met officials said on Tuesday.        
	The last time February was unusually warm was in 2006, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the weather section of Regional Meteorological Centre, Alipore.

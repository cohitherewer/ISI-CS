The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Police chose to see no evil: report
                                                                                                               Police chose to see no evil: report

	An intelligence report has nailed the nexus between the local administration and Gaffars gang, even as the land sharks alleged employer was remanded in judicial custody for 14 days by the chief judicial magistrate of Barasat.        
	The report prepared by the state intelligence branch has revealed that police knew about the forcible land acquisition by Gaffar Mollah and his men but chose to turn a blind eye.        
	North 24-Parganas police as well senior district officials were fully aware of how they were going about terrorising farmers and grabbing land in Rajarhat, said a senior official with the intelligence branch. But they kept mum.        
	The report points an accusing finger at police inaction while stating that some local politicians had played a role in allowing the land-grab goons a free run.        
	The report highlighted how Gaffar and his men had procured arms to terrorise villagers. At several places land for the mega IT project was grabbed at gunpoint by Gaffar and his men, the report states.        
	This echoes the statement  land was being purchased at gunpoint  by home secretary Ardhendu Sen at Writers Buildings the day after the attack on Vedic Village.        
	When asked about the report, Rahul Srivastava, the SP of North 24-Parganas, said: I cannot comment on this.        
	A senior IPS officer said the police could have easily arrested Gaffar and his men by slapping charges of criminal intimidation but their hands were tied.        
	It was a political decision and the police were asked not to intervene. Politicians need to come clean on the issue, he said, adding that if Gaffars actions were dictated by realtors like Modi, the polices inaction was dictated by politicians.        
	A few local politicians are beginning to feel the heat, while the managing director of Vedic Realty is in the dock.        
	Modi and his companys assistant manager Biplab Biswas were produced in court on Thursday with their counsel pleading for bail on the ground that they need not be kept in jail as most of the accused had been arrested.        
	But Sumitra Roy, the chief judicial magistrate of Barasat court, sent them to two weeks of judicial custody.        
	Abdul Hai, alias Kalobabu, and Moinuddin, who were arrested in connection with the football match fracas on April 23, got the same treatment.        
	The police are now on the lookout for around 15 members of the Gaffar gang who are on the run.

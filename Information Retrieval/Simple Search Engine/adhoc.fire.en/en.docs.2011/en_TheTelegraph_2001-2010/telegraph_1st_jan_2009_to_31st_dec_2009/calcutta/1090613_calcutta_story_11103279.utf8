The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Nursing home shifts swine flu suspect
                                                                                                               Nursing home shifts swine flu suspect
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A 24-year-old man admitted to a private nursing home with cough and fever days after returning from a trip to France was shifted to the Infectious Diseases Hospital on Friday and quarantined for suspected swine flu.        
	Asif Iqbal, a resident of Rajarhat, had landed at Calcutta airport from France on May 31 and cleared the mandatory swine flu check for passengers coming from abroad.         
	But when he went to a Salt Lake nursing home early on Thursday with cough and fever, the back-from-France tag prompted doctors to quarantine him.             
	If you feel unwell, have high fever, cough or sore throat:   Stay at home and avoid contact with people  
	 Rest and take plenty of fluids 
  lCover your nose and mouth when coughing and sneezing  
	 Inform family and friends about your illness   
	 If possible, contact a health professional before travelling to a health facility to discuss whether a medical examination is necessary      
	He had no other symptoms of swine flu like headache and body ache. We quarantined him only because he had just returned from France, said a spokesperson for the nursing home.        
	On Friday, the nursing home authorities decided not to take a chance and shifted him to the Beleghata hospital in an ambulance around 3pm.         
	Asif will have to stay in the hospitals male isolation ward at least till his throat and nasal swab reports arrive from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases in New Delhi.        
	Sutapa Bhattacharya of Kalyani was released from the same ward on Wednesday, after enduring mosquito bites and unhygienic surroundings for three nights.        
	Toronto resident Sushmita Biswas and her toddler, Gibson, had gone through a similar experience last month.        
	Doctors at the Beleghata hospital apparently assured Asif that they would try to speed up the process of testing him for swine flu.         
	Asifs test results should be in by Sunday. Throat and nasal swabs were drawn and sent within an hour of the patients admission. We are doing our best to speed up the process of diagnosis, said one of the doctors who examined Asif after he was shifted to the Infectious Diseases Hospital.        
	According to him, Asifs symptoms indicated that the chances of him testing positive for swine flu were minimal.        
	The normal incubation period for swine flu is one to seven days. As many as 12 days have elapsed since he returned from France. So we presume it is not swine flu, but there is no way we can be certain without carrying out tests, the doctor added.        
	Sources said Asif, who was in France on an official assignment, started running a temperature and coughing a few days after returning to the city. His family members were unavailable for comment.

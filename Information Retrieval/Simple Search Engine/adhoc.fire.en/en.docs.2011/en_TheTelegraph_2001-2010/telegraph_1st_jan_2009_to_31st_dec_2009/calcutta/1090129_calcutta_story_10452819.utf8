The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Turf war in twin murders
                                                                                                               Turf war in twin murders
  - Flashpoint over station stall, 4 held during Dum Dum bandh          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A tussle between two groups over a tea stall at Durganagar railway station had triggered the fatal attack on CPM leaders Sujit and Sambhu Dasgupta late on Tuesday, police said hours after arresting four youths.        
	The aftershocks of the attack were felt throughout Dum Dum on Wednesday with the CPMs local committee calling a 12-hour bandh.        
	Shopkeepers were forced to down shutters, thoroughfares were blocked and even private cars were stopped as CPM cadres enforced the bandh till evening.        
	Among those held on Wednesday for the twin murders was Krishnendu Bhattacharya, alias Khokon, who residents said had been flexing his muscles of late.        
	The others in the net are Krishnendus brother Shibendu, Asim Basak and Debashis Sanyal. The two choppers that were used to kill the leaders have been recovered.        
	The four were picked up from a hideout in Palta, just when they were planning to leave for Lataguri, in north Bengal, where Khokon owns property. The Bolero in which they were to flee has been seized, said Supratim Sarkar, the superintendent of North 24-Parganas police.        
	The police are on the lookout for two others.        
	CPM cadres went on the rampage after the murders, torching shops and motorcycles in Khokons neighbourhood. And the morning after, they paralysed the whole of Dum Dum with a show of strength.        
	Some residents attributed the killings to infighting within the CPM. Intra-party feuds have been raging since Durganagar started witnessing a realty boom a few years ago, said one.        
	Sujit, a member of the CPM zonal committee, had turned up at the station around 8.30pm on Tuesday with a few youths, including relative Sambhu, to talk to Khokon about a tea stall on platform No. 2. The cops said the owner had recently sold the stall to Mahadev Sarkar, keeping the railway stations hawkers union in the dark.        
	Dasgupta, who headed the union, had decided to take up the matter with Khokon, who was allegedly backing Mahadev. During the altercation, Khokon and his men attacked Sujit and Sambhu with choppers, said an officer.        
	The two were taken to hospital where Sambhu, in his 30s, was declared dead on arrival and Sujit, in his 60s, succumbed to the injuries after being admitted.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Resolution amp; independence
                                                                                                               Resolution amp; independence
                                        Its Christmas and not ex-maas; and think before saying Nano again                            
	A recent survey says New Year resolutions are bad for health. People make them only to break them  and this leads to a sense of failure, low self-esteem and more New Year resolutions.         
	Is that what has happened to the city too? Should Calcuttans not hope at all?         
	The answer, experts say, lies in making resolutions that can be kept. Curb your enthusiasm, they say. Metro on Sunday thought of a few resolves that the city can keep:         
	It should stop pretending to be the culture capital of India. Calcutta has no novelists writing in Bengali who we can claim to be the best  or even among the best  in India. Most writers of repute writing in English live in Delhi or Mumbai or New York or London. Once home to several leading poets, Calcuttas reputation rests on the frail shoulders of Sankho Ghosh alone. The greatest film makers are dead. And all the worlds is an empty stage. Well, almost.         
	The city still houses great artists  Ganesh Pyne, Jogen Chowdhury, Ganesh Haloi. Still, no one recognises it even as the art capital.        
	Bengali-speaking Calcuttans should stop speaking in Hindi to taxi drivers  whether they are Bengali or Bihari. Given a choice between bad Bengali and horror Hindi, the Bihari driver may prefer the first. We arent sure what the Bengali driver would like.         
	There should be more nightclubs, where you can go with your boyfriend/girlfriend and not be robbed for drinking and snacking, than sleazy central Calcutta dance bars. In case you havent noticed, its become next to impossible for a respectable after-work drinker  five or six days a week depending on office custom  to visit a watering hole in the centre of the city without his manhood being challenged.         
	And women arent allowed into these places just to have a drink.         
	Talking of dancing, the citys men, particularly  which is not to say its women can give Beyonce a run for her booty-shake  should resolve to take some floor lessons. Theyll realise theres more to dancing than jiggling carb-created paunch, arms akimbo and feet planted like Virender Sehwags when hes poking the ball into the slips.         
	Calcuttans should stop saying Happy Merry Christmas! The phrase was rampant on December 25 last year. They can also stop saying Merry ex-maas, for it is not ex, but Greek  a complicated Greek abbreviation for Christ!        
	Calcutta can wish that its first citizen, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, would stop treating the book fair as the acme of the citys intellectual life. It reminds us again of the death of this city as Indias culture capital.         
	Some of its house owners  maybe all  should put a coat of paint on their palaces. Our city fathers/mothers should think of making it mandatory to paint houses every five years. And, in turn, make it mandatory for themselves to keep the streets free of dirt. Dirt inside is private business. But on public display? Tch, tch.         
	Hope Calcutta can stop talking about the Nano being moved out of Bengal and instead start talking about driving personal Nanos into Bengal. Since Mamata Banerjee is known for her frugal ways, heres a second related wish: she gets a Nano for herself. Cheap to drive, cheaper to run to the next dharna site.         
	Discourage the trend of slaughtering Tagores works in the name of film adaptations. A new-age version of a classic doesnt have to be an exhibition of contemporary kitsch. Shesher Kobita doesnt have to be amplified as Mon Amour (in English) Shesher Kobita (in Bengali) revisited. Thats not a film title, thats a footnote  and etymologically incorrect. We are also a little tired of Rituparna Sengupta as a Tagore heroine. She acted in Mon Amour and Chaturanga  Four Chapters.         
	Calcutta should desist from naming antiseptic lotions and pain balms Suthol (presumably after soothe all) or Penorub. Penorub, in particular, hurts. Ouch!

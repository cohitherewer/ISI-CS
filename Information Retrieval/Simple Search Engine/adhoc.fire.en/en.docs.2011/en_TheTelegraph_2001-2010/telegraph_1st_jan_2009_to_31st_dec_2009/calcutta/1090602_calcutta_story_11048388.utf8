	A 34-year-old motorcyclist rammed into a divider on Vidyasagar Setu, toppled over the railing and crashed into the ground 20ft below on Monday morning.        
	Kaushik Mondal, a diploma engineer who was on his way to office on Park Street, suffered severe injuries in the head and chest and fractured his limbs.         
	A police team, alerted by witnesses, took the resident of Howrahs Bantra to SSKM Hospital.        
	His head would have been smashed had he not worn a helmet, said an officer of Hastings police station. Late on Monday, hospital sources said his condition was critical.        
	The cops said Mondal was travelling at a high speed and lost control at the mouth of two ramps  one leading towards Fort William and the other towards the AJC Bose Road flyover.        
	He rammed into the divider between the approaches to the two ramps, toppled over the railing under the impact and fell near a shrine. The two-wheeler was smashed, the officer said.        
	The stretch has witnessed many accidents but this was the first instance of a victim being flung over the railing under the impact of the crash, the officer added.        
	Pedestrians, alerted by a loud thud, rushed to the spot and found Mondal lying unconscious, blood oozing out of his nose and mouth. They immediately got in touch with the police.        
	Mondal did a diploma in computer engineering from a private institute five years ago and worked in several companies before joining the Park Street firm.

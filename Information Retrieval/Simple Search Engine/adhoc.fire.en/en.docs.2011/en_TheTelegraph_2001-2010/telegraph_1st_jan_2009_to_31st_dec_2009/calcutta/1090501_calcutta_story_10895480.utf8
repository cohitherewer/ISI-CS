The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CMC pulls down vote banners
                                                                                                               CMC pulls down vote banners
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                              
	The civic authorities have for the first time started removing poll banners and festoons from lamp posts and road dividers following an order from the Election Commission.        
	Soon after we received the order from the commission on Thursday afternoon, we started pulling down festoons and banners of all parties, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.        
	The commissioner formed a panel comprising two joint civic commissioners and five deputy commissioners of police to monitor the implementation of the panels directive.        
	Chief electoral officer Debashis Sen asked the Calcutta Municipal Corporation to remove the banners and festoons on the basis of reports from poll observers who have visited parts of North and South Calcutta constituencies.        
	The returning officers of the two constituencies said civic teams had started removing the campaign materials on Thursday afternoon. It could take up to two weeks for all banners and festoons to be removed, said an official.        
	There are around 40,000 lamp posts in Calcutta North. By Thursday evening, CMC teams managed to bring down less than 200 banners, said an official from Calcutta North.        
	The scene was similar in Calcutta South. There are around 50,000 posts and it would take at least 10 days to remove all campaign materials. A little over a hundred were pulled down by the evening, said a source in the returning officers office in Calcutta South.        
	There was tension at Shyambazar when a civic team started confiscating festoons and banners. Political workers insisted the items be handed over to them. Following talks with poll observers, the commissioner directed the civic team to hand over the materials to the respective parties.

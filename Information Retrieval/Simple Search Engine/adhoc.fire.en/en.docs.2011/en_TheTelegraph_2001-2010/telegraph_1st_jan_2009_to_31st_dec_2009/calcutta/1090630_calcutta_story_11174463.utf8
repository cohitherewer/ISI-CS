The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Dawn drivers draw blood
                                                                                                               Dawn drivers draw blood
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Santi Ranjan Sinha                                  
	Early morning rash driving claimed two lives on Monday.        
	A 72-year-old trader about to board a minibus in the middle of the road was knocked down by another minibus around 6.40am.        
	Santi Ranjan Sinha, a resident of Bhupen Bose Avenue in north Calcutta, was rushed to a nearby nursing home but died an hour later. He had suffered injuries in the waist, legs and pelvic region.        
	The drivers of both buses were arrested and the vehicles impounded.        
	Metro had on June 18 reported how at several vital intersections between 5.10am and 6.45am no traffic rule was followed and there was no cop patrol in sight.        
	Senior officers at Lalbazar on Monday expressed concern over fatal accidents in the late and early hours. Officers of the traffic department have been asked to intensify vigil on the roads at odd hours, said an officer.        
	The promise of police action comes too little too late for the Sinha family on Bhupen Bose Avenue.        
	Santi Ranjan Sinha, the director of a company running cold storages, followed his daily habit of leaving home around 6.30am on his way to his Posta office. Family members said since his driver never turned up so early, he would go to office by bus.        
	The trader was boarding a minibus on the Belghoria-Howrah fire station route that had stopped in the middle of the road. He was about to get on the bus when a minibus on the Nagerbazar-Howrah station route knocked him down while trying to overtake the other vehicle from the left, said an officer of Shyampukur police station.        
	He suffered multiple fractures in his legs and waist and died of internal haemorrhage, said a doctor of the nursing home where Sinha was taken. Sinha is survived by his wife and three daughters.        
	Since he was an early riser and the driver turned up late, he made it a point to go to office by bus, said Sinhas elder brother Gurupada. He was very fit for his age. He was an ardent fan of Brazil and slept late on Sunday after watching the Confederation Cup final between Brazil and America, recalled Gurupada.        
	Residents protested rash driving and smashed the windshields and windowpanes of the two buses.        
	Morning accidents on the stretch have become a routine affair. Drivers never abide by traffic rules and there is no cop in the early hours, said Bappa Chowdhury, a resident.        
	A few hours before the morning mishap, a 30-year-old youth, identified as Chhotu, died after the motorcycle he was riding was knocked down by a car at the Beleghata Main Road-EM Bypass crossing.        
	Two youths from Mahestala on the motorcycle were taken to NRS hospital where Chhotu was declared dead on arrival. Sheikh Aftab, who was riding pillion, was released after treatment. The car driver fled without the vehicle.

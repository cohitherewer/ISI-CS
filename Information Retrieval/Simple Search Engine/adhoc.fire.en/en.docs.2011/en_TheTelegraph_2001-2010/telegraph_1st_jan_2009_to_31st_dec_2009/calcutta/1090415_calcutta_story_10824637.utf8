The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Victoria as (mock) war zone   Memorial mock drill 
                                                                                                               Victoria as (mock) war zone             A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	8.25am/Tuesday/Sit Rep: Victoria Memorial, North Gate.        
	Armed men in uniform suddenly start descending on the spot. Some get busy cordoning off the area, shooing everyone out. Others take up position to take on the enemy, crawling on their elbows, slipping behind trees and bushes, rifles at the ready.         
	Panic robs morning walkers and passersby of their voice, but gives their feet wings. They run, or Bolt, fear writ large on their faces. The 10-12 cars parked outside the Memorial gates are abandoned by their owners desperate to flee the war zone.        
	Cars are debarred from the stretch bordering the Memorial, from Hospital Road to Birla Planetarium.         
	Sniffer dogs, bomb disposal squads and ambulances come rushing in. The injured are whisked away to SSKM Hospital.        
	Then, Operation Victoria Memorial ends, just like it had begun  suddenly.        
	The mock drill masterminded by top cops to gauge the preparedness of the citys police and security agencies in terror combat has ended.        
	All is well with Victoria Memorial again.        
	What triggered the mock drill? An explosion has occurred outside north gate of Victoria Memorial and 10 persons are injured  this was the shock SMS that landed in the inbox of senior IPS officers of Calcutta police, at 8.10am on Tuesday.        
	The same message was relayed to the 48 police stations in the city, and allied agencies like the BSF, the CRPF, the State Disaster Management Authority, and the fire and emergency services wing.                          
	The mission? To kick-start terror-combat operations by various agencies that keep the city safe, as spelt out in the Standard Operating Procedure, drawn up under the guidelines of the ministry of home affairs. Police stations must be on Level II alert  very high, say after an explosion.        
	While some units performed well, there were slip-ups on the part of some units from various departments. We are drawing up a detailed report and would discuss it with everyone to fine-tune things, said police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti, head of the think tank that triggered Tuesdays panic attack.        
	What does the Standard Operating Procedure specify? Various crisis-management agencies must ensure that:         
	 The spot is cordoned off for bomb experts to diffuse any live explosives lying around.        
	 The adjoining police stations start the vehicle checking process and coordinate with nearby hospitals for removal of the injured.        
	 The traffic police allow smooth movement of vehicles carrying the injured. Nakabandi at entry and exit points.        
	 Special action force (SAF) and rapid action force (RAF) take up positions, adequately armed.        
	 Cops co-ordinate with agencies including fire services and civil defence departments.        
	The first to arrive at the explosion site on Tuesday were wireless vans patrolling the Maidan. Then came a team from Hastings police station.         
	At the same time RAF and SAF members trooped in and took up position armed with SLRs and Insas, said a senior IPS officer.        
	Seven ambulances screamed to the spot and the process of removing the injured  all dummies played by cops  to SSKM began.        
	The mock drill was called off once a bomb with a timer was sniffed out from a bush on the Memorial greens.        
	We wanted to throw the officers into a seemingly real situation and test how the system is equipped to tackle such an emergency. There were a few glitches in the operation, which would have to be addressed. Overall, the reaction time was more or less fine, said Sivaji Ghosh, the additional commissioner of police.

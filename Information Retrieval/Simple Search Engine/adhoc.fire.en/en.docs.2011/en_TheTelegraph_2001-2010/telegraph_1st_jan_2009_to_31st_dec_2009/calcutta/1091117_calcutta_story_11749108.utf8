          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The state government on Monday laid down afresh attendance rules that are seldom enforced now.        
	The rules framed by the government and announced by finance minister Asim Dasgupta call for strict observance of duty hours. Employees reaching office late more than thrice a month would have to forfeit a casual leave.        
	The rules are likely to be re-implemented from Tuesday after chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti, who was not in Calcutta on Monday, signs the circular announcing them.        
	From now on, every employees attendance will be scrutinised thoroughly on a daily basis and assessed at weekly intervals by the state government. Officials of the rank of joint secretary will keep track of the daily attendance in every department. The names of those who are late by more than 15 minutes will be marked. If someone is late thrice a month, he or she will have to lose a casual leave, said the finance minister.        
	The joint secretaries have been asked to send their attendance reports to the department secretaries, who in turn will pass them on to the chief secretary every week. Deputy secretaries used to look after attendance matters earlier.        
	The chief secretary will submit such reports to the chief minister. This will ensure regular monitoring and assessment of attendance of government employees. An employee with good attendance record will be preferred over one with poor record during promotion, said the finance minister.        
	The general secretary of the state co-ordination committee, Ananta Bandopadhyay, said: We have often found that employees come on time but not the official in charge of recording attendance. It has to be a two-way traffic.         
	Shyamal Kumar Mitra, the joint convener of the Trinamul-affiliated Mahakaran Sangram Committee, said the finance ministers announcement was a ploy to divert the attention of employees.

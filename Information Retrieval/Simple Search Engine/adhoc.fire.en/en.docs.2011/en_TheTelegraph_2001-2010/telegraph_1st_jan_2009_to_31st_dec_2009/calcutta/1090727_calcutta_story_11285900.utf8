The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Comfort in wet week ahead
                                                                                                               Comfort in wet week ahead
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Wet Sunday has set the tone for the week ahead, says the weatherman.        
	Widespread rain has been forecast in the city and its suburbs over the next couple of days. According to the Met office, there could be a marginal increase in temperatures but rain will keep the discomfort factor down.        
	Cloud imagery from the satellite Kalpana-1 at 2.30pm on Sunday showed convective clouds over central, north-west and south-east Bay of Bengal.         
	The convective cloud formation is a harbinger of sustained rain. In the next 48 hours we are likely to experience fairly widespread rainfall activity over Gangetic Bengal, an official said.        
	On Sunday, rain lashed the city in spurts with the heaviest shower occurring late in the afternoon.        
	The Alipore Met office, however, recorded only 1.1mm of rainfall.        
	Although the city and its neighbourhood received normal monsoon showers on Sunday, it wasnt uniform. That is the reason why the Alipore Met office recorded scanty rainfall, explained an official.        
	While Monday should be comfortable with temperatures ranging between 34 and 27 degrees Celsius, the mercury might climb a few notches above normal over the next couple of days.        
	The balancing factor will be spells of rain. So the city should remain moderately wet, cool and comfortable, the Met official said.        
	The city was bracing for heavy rain last week when the low-pressure trough that was expected to turn into a deep depression over the Bay of Bengal suddenly changed course and entered Orissa.

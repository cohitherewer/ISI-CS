                      A theatre plot gone awry                    A popular, timeless creation of Satyajit Ray, Feluda has always captured the imagination of readers with his handsome appearance and crisp intelligence. Charbaks latest production, Apsara Theatre-er Maamla, is based on a Feluda story by Ray. The maiden directorial venture of veteran thespian Sabyasachi Chakraborty, it is a play of suspense and intrigue built around the milieu of the traditional Bengali theatre houses. With its golden days long lost and forgotten, these theatres lie in neglect and are being either rented out as venues for social functions or being sold to promoters of real estate. In the play, producer Bhikarimal Jhunjhunwala has decided to sell off Apsara Theatre to one such promoter, much against the wishes of his actors, technicians and the director of his plays. Disaster strikes the members one after another even as they continue with rehearsals for their upcoming play Chhannachhara. As actors vanish or are murdered, Feluda is called in to investigate the crimes. Is Bhikarimal employing criminal tactics? Or is there an even greater conspiracy? The plot unfolds how Feluda and his associates, Topshe and Jatayu, unravel the multiple murder mystery.                    Event: Play in Bengali, Apsara Theatre-er Maamla, produced by Charbak When: Today at 6 pm Where: Bharatiyam Cultural Multiplex, IB-201 Salt Lake

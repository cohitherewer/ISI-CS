The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Price peeve in pocket that has kept prize township powerless
                                                                                                               Price peeve in pocket that has kept prize township powerless
          ZEESHAN JAWED                                                  
	Every night after dinner, 65-year-old farmer Rashid Mondal hops onto his bicycle, armed with a lathi and a whistle, and does a round of the southern boundaries of his village. This has been his ritual since April this year.        
	Rashid is not alone. Hundreds of farmers in Chhapna mouza in New Town have been keeping a vigil to stop Hidco officials and cops from entering their village and installing electric poles for high-tension wires.        
	Welcome to the solitary pocket of resistance  which according to the chief minister has the necessary social infrastructure  that has rendered the government housing departments showpiece township powerless.         
	Recently, housing minister Goutam Deb admitted during the inauguration of a business park in Rajarhat that resistance from some people was coming in the way of providing power to the entire township. He pleaded with the protesters to allow electricity poles to be erected in their area but the villagers are not ready to budge.         
	A power station has come up in the neighbouring mouza of Akandakeshari that will transmit power to the sub-stations to illuminate the township. But poles have to be erected for the high-tension wires before that. Poles number 7, 8 and 9 are meant to come up in Chhapna, about 8km from Salt Lake.        
	We have been guarding our village since April, when Hidco officials along with police and CPM goons descended on our village and started installing electric poles, said Mondal.         
	The farmers base their opposition on inadequate compensation for fertile land and blame Hidco for forcing them into selling their land at a discounted price.         
	Chhapna is one of the 25 mouzas that was acquired in 2004-05 to set up the ambitious Megacity. The entire process of converting farmland into commercial plots in Rajarhat was peaceful, making the housing minister brag about the peaceful and successful land transfer.        
	Till Chhapna happened. The resistance of the local people remained unnoticed for several months till the Vedic Village controversy prised open a can of worms.         
	Inadequate compensation is the biggest stumbling block, claimed residents of Chhapna. According to them, villagers of adjoining Garagari mouza, where land had not been acquired for the Megacity project, are getting several lakhs per cottah from private developers while Hidco has paid Rs 13,000 per cottah in Chhapna.         
	What sort of a system is this? We are willing to sell our land but we want to sell it directly to promoters and the developers at the market rate, said Khaled Molla, a farmer.        
	Then there is the fertility factor. The land here is very fertile. We have two paddy harvests along with vegetables and sesame seeds. We cannot give up such fertile land for such a paltry sum, said Iman Ali Mollah, another villager from Chhapna.        
	Another factor is the displacement of families. According to Hidco, 80 families will have to move out of their current residences for the towers and other mechanical infrastructure to come up, which is not acceptable to the villagers.         
	Hidco officials claimed Chhapna had been acquired for Megacity and the farmers had been adequately compensated so there should be no resistance from them.        
	The land has been acquired on paper but we are not being allowed to install the electric poles because of resistance by some residents. So many projects are stuck because we are not being able to provide power, said Prodyut Biswas, the general manager of Hidco.         
	The farmers suggested that Hidco install towers in Patharghata mouza, on the southern side of Chhapna across the Bagjola canal, where the government agency has been able to acquire land.         
	In Chhapna, almost all the farmers have decided not to accept their compensation, which has been deposited in the court.        
	The authorities have cut off water supply to force us to give up land. But we are using private pumps to draw water from the canal, said a defiant farmer.

                                                                                                               Poll army keeps car and papers
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The poll army, which hasnt returned Sachin Halders SUV even two days after the election ended despite a high court order, has allegedly refused to hand over the papers of another traders car that could not be seized as it broke down.        
	A team from PVD had requisitioned trader Samir Changoiwalas Scorpio on Ballygunge Circular Road on April 16 and taken away its tax token and the drivers driving licence. The cars engine developed problems four days before it was to be handed over.        
	Changoiwala sent his driver Sundar Rai to the PVD office at Beltala to get back the seized documents on Friday. The officials allegedly misbehaved with him and shooed him away.         
	An official asked Sundar to furnish documents proving that the car was still in the workshop. When he went back with the papers and also showed the receipts, the official refused to budge, Changoiwala told Metro.        
	The official said since we didnt give our car for election duty, he had no documents to give us, said Sundar.        
	Halders driver said on Friday that the traders Tata Safari was being used by poll officials at the counting centre in Bankim Sardar College in Canning. There was no word on when the car would be returned.        
	The high court had directed the Canning SDO to appear in court on May 22 and explain why the vehicle wasnt returned even after an order to that effect.

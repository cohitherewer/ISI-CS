The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Blind champ in pool and class swims against tide
                                                                                                               Blind champ in pool and class swims against tide
          SANJAY MANDAL                          Braille battle: Rana Kar (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                  
	A blind champion swimmer who missed representing India in the 2004 Paralympics because his tea-vendor father could not pay for the trip now fears he might also miss out on higher education despite 86 per cent in Madhyamik.        
	I am in a Higher Secondary school at Seoraphuli (in Hooghly) but am not sure about completing my studies, Rana Kar, 18, told Metro.        
	A neighbour in Barasat paid the admission fee of Rs 385, but Rana still does not have books in Braille. As of now, I am using a recorder that was gifted to me to tape lectures and listen to them at home. Even if someone were to provide me the books that I require, what about the future when my academic requirements will increase? he wondered.         
	Ranas father, Babul Kar, earns around Rs 1,000 a month by working in a local tea stall. Mother Lakshmi is a homemaker. His younger brother Panna dropped out of school in Class IX because their father could not afford to have both sons in school.        
	I have to pay Rs 500 as rent per month for the one-room house; then there are the other basic expenses. I wish my sons could continue studying, but I dont have the money to shoulder their educational expenses, said Babul.        
	Rana, blind since childhood because of detached retina, passed Madhyamik this year from Ramakrishna Mission Blind Boys Academy in Narendrapur with 86.88 per cent. He aspires to teach history or Bengali in a school or college someday.         
	The teenager is not only a meritorious student but also a champion swimmer who has won competitions since his childhood days.        
	In 2004, he won silver in 50-metre freestyle and bronze in breaststroke and butterfly over the same distance at the national championship organised by the Swimming Association of India for Disabled in Mumbai.         
	I had qualified for the Summer Paralympics in Greece but my family couldnt afford to pay Rs 1.5 lakh for my trip. That was my first big setback, recalled Rana.        
	Rana would have quit studies long ago had his mother not encouraged him to swim against the tide. My son is a meritorious boy, and I want him to continue studying even if we have to subsist on one meal a day, said Lakshmi.         
	The only light at the end of the tunnel as of now is a merit scholarship for which he has been shortlisted. Swapno, an organisation of residents of New Town, is behind the initiative to support physically and economically challenged students of the North 24-Parganas.

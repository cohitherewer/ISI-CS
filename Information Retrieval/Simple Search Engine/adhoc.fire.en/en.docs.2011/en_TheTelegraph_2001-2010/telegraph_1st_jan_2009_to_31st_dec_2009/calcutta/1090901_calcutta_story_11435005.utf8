The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Vedic boss claims ignorance
                                                                                                               Vedic boss claims ignorance
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Raj Kishore Modi, the managing director and chairman of Vedic Realty, has claimed during interrogation that his employees had kept him in the dark about the weapons stocked in Vedic Village and the strong-arm tactics used to acquire land.         
	Siddinath Gupta, the deputy inspector general of police (Presidency range) interrogated Modi for over two hours on Monday at New Town police station.        
	Modi told us that his employees did not share with him the details of how they were going about purchasing land, said an investigating officer. He said he was aware of the existence of some arms for security purposes but did not know that arms were being stockpiled on the premises.         
	Modi was arrested on Saturday and produced in Barasat Court the next day. He was remanded in police custody for two days.         
	We tried to clarify some points with Modi in connection with the recovery of arms from Vedic Village and details of their recent land deals with farmers. As he was not feeling well, we could not pressure him for all the details, said Gupta.         
	The cops will scan the land deal documents and tally the prices paid to farmers with the prevailing market rates.         
	If there is a discrepancy, it can be established that the resort authorities were buying land through coercion, said an investigating officer.         
	If we can establish that the owners were buying land at a price lower than the market rate, Modi cannot pass the buck to others, the officer added.        
	Gaffar, the key accused, is still absconding. Home secretary Ardhendu Sen said on Monday: Most probably he is not in the state.

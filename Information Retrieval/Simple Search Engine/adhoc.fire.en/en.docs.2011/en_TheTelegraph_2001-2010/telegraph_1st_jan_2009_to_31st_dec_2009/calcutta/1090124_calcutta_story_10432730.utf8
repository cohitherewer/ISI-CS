The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Man held   for teasing
                                                                                                               Man held   for teasing
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A youth, Gopal Das, was caught by residents of Nabapally in Barasat and handed over to police for trying to molest a schoolgirl on Thursday night. His associate, Ratan Debnath, fled. The police said the duo had allegedly harassed Sunanda Roy (name changed), a Class X student of Jogendranath High School, while she was returning home from tuition at 9pm.         
	I had come with my son Raju to take Sunanda home and we protested when the men used filthy language, said the girls mother Pratima.        
	Residents said when Raju warned them against harassing his family, the duo hit Pratima and tried to drag away Sunanda. The girls screams alerted some local youths, who chased them and caught Das.

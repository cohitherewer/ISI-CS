The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Kasab terror school training for Taher
                                                                                                               Kasab terror school training for Taher
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Abu Taher, the alleged Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) explosives expert held in the city last week, underwent the same training as Ajmal Kasab and at the same centre in Muridke, Pakistan.        
	Taher, who is believed to have supplied explosives for 24 blasts across India since 1997, attended the first phase of a training module called Dahar-e-alam at the Muridke centre.        
	Kasab, the lone survivor among the 26/11 terrorists, completed the module and went on to undertake a second phase of training  Dahar-e-Khas, on how to cause maximum casualty during attacks. Kasab spent six months at the centre before the Mumbai terror strike.        
	Apart from handling explosives, Taher was taught how to fire automatic weapons, said an officer of the Special Task Force.        
	The middle-aged man, born in Katihar, Bihar, left the country for Bangladesh in 1997. He told the police that he had trained at Muridke in 1999.        
	During training, he would wake up before 5am. After morning prayers, the trainees would have a breakfast of roti, sabzi and milk, Taher told the police.        
	Two hours of lectures by LeT leaders would follow. The objective of the session was to motivate the trainees. Firing practice would be held before lunch, said an interrogator.         
	According to Taher, he was selected for explosives training after a few sessions at the firing range. In the afternoon, he used to spend hours in the training camps laboratory, learning about chemical compounds used for manufacturing explosives, added the interrogator.        
	In the evening, the trainees would be shown videos of speeches by Osama bin Laden and Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, who plotted the Mumbai attack.        
	After completing the module, Taher took part in a passing out parade in front of Lakhvi. So far, Taher has not regretted what he has done. He still feels proud that Lakhvi had patted him on the shoulder for his skills in handling explosives, said an STF officer.        
	The explosives expert returned to India to recruit for the LeT. He was arrested by STF officers as soon as he got off the Lalgola Passenger on March 6.

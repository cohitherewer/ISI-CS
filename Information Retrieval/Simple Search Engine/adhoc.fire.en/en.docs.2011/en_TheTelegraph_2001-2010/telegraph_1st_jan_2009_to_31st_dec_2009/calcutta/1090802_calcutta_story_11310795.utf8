	Talsari in Orissa lies on the north-eastern coast of India. It is around 200km from Calcutta and provides an ideal weekend holiday destination.         
	The place has vast stretches of green paddy fields, numerous rivers, blue hills and extensive beaches.         
	The name Talsari was possibly derived from the rows of palm trees that line the picturesque spot. Tal means palm trees and sari means a row. The beach with its tall coconut trees, palm trees and casuarinas make for a beautiful sight. The word tal also means rhythm, which is reflected in the sea waves lapping against the shore.         
	Witnessing sunrise and sunset from a gleaming stretch of white sand is a rewarding experience. Another feature of Talsari that fascinates tourists is its backwaters, which one needs to cross to reach the sea.         
	The stream plays hide-and-seek with people. When the stream is brimming, one can only reach the main beach with the help of a boat. But at other times, one can walk across the dry riverbed. The place is fairly windy.         
	There are a few places of interest around Talsari in the district of Balasore. One can visit the popular seaside destination Digha in West Bengal, which is just 10km away.         
	Udaipur Beach, which is the last beach on this stretch, is 7km away. Chandaneswar, famous for its Chadak mela held in mid-April, is 3km away. Bhusandeswar  18 km away  has possibly the countrys largest Shiva lingam (13 ft x 14 ft) and is worth a visit.        
	All these places can be reached by cars or motor-operated vans called bhutbutis.              
	Going:         
	Take a van or hire a car to Talsari from Digha. Jaleshwar  36 km from Talsari  is the nearest railway station. Bhubaneswar is the nearest airport and is 300km from Talsari.

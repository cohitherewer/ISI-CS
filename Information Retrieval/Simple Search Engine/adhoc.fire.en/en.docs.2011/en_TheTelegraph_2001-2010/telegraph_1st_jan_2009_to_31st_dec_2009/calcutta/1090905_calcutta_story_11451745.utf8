The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mishti can leave bitter taste in mouth
                                                                                                               Mishti can leave bitter taste in mouth
          KINSUK BASU                          Sweets on display.   (Bishwarup Dutta)                                        
	This festive season, the rasogolla or the kaju barfi could taste a tad less sweet. The piping hot samosa might also not be as appetising.        
	Blame it all on the party-pooper price rise of sugar and potatoes.        
	On Saturday, representatives of over 11,000 sweetshop owners across the city will convene an extraordinary general meeting of the Paschim Banga Mistanna Byabsaee Samity with a plan to push up prices of sweets and savouries by 20 per cent.        
	The price of sugar has doubled and that of potatoes has shot through the roof. Its becoming impossible for us to keep going without a price hike. Around 10 shops have already downed shutters across the city, said Rabindra Kumar Paul, the general secretary of the Samity and the man behind Hindustan Sweets. On Saturday, we will issue a circular to all our members for an immediate price rise.        
	Over the past few months the price of refined sugar  the key component for any mishti seller  has soared from Rs 14 to Rs 35 per kg. With ghee, kaju and jafraan also costing more, sweet shops have been left with a bitter taste in the mouth.        
	The way in which raw material prices have shot up, we cant absorb it anymore. Prices of Bangali mishti could shoot up 50 per cent this festive season, warned Prasanta Nandy of Girish Chandra Dey and Nakur Chandra Nandy, who does not attend meetings of the trade body. Things are no different for mithai and samosa makers.        
	Its a question of survival, said Sudip Mullick of Balaram Mullick and Radharaman Mullick. In this festive season we cant cut down on the size, so price hike is the only answer.        
	The Calcuttan with a sweet tooth is bracing for the inevitable. I think stockists have a hand in the rise of sugar prices. This festive season, those who can afford to will have sweets, those who cant, wont, writer Shirshendu Mukhopadhyay put it bluntly.        
	People might initially think twice but they will soon get back to buying sweets. Sweets are addictive, smiled actor Arjun Chakraborty.

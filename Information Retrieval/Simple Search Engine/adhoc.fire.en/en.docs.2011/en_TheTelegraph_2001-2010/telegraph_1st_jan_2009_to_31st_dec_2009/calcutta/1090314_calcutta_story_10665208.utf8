                                                                                                               Injury clue in woman death 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Beautician Gauri Bagal, allegedly killed by her married lover Pintu Pal, might have died of a wound near her left temple, which was detected during post-mortem.        
	The surgeon who conducted the post-mortem on the 22-year-olds body said the wound could have caused internal haemorrhage. A hit by a blunt object or a fall might have resulted in the injury.         
	Her hair, nail and blood samples and the contents of her stomach have been sent for forensic tests, which will ascertain the cause of death, said the doctor.        
	Police suspect Pal had spiked Gauris drink in a bar off Kona Expressway. He then rode around Howrah on his motorcycle for an hour with the girls limp body placed between him and his friend Potla, who was riding pillion.        
	After his arrest, Pintu told the police that Gauri had fallen ill after consuming liquor. The statement can only be verified after Potla is tracked down, said an investigator.        
	Gauris family members have accused Pal of murdering her. Mother Taraki said: For a long time, my daughter did not know that Pintu was married. She recently told us that she was not interested in marrying him and asked us to fix a match for her. She was concentrating on her beauty parlour.

                      Society and relationships                    The complete decadence and breakdown of traditional Indian values in contemporary middle-class society is poignantly brought to the fore in Spandans latest production, Apan Hain Deshpande. The play narrates the events that unfold in the Deshpande household. A renowned name in Dharangaon, the family is in the midst of preparations for the wedding of a son and daughter. Parag, the eldest son, looks after the family estate and business interests. However, his parents disapprove of his dealings with people of dubious character. Ranju, his sister, is also to be married in the same week as her brother. Despite elaborate wedding arrangements for the two, the spirit of joy and merrymaking is sadly missing as the family is haunted by two scandals. Many years ago, Ranju had stolen her mothers jewels and eloped with her lover, being brought back home forcibly, later. And Parag has a mistress who still flaunts her affair with him shamelessly. The play portrays identifiable relationships and social issues, knitted together through a powerful plot that explores various shades of moods and meanings in an absorbing family drama. Drama: Mahesh Elkunchwar. Direction: Ashok Singh. Cast: Sudhir Nigam, Renu Roy, Dilip Dave, Kalpana Thakur Jha, Pratibha Singh and others.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Two more hooch deaths
                                                                                                               Two more hooch deaths
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two residents of Behala died late on Wednesday allegedly after consuming spurious liquor, taking the death toll since Sunday night to eight.         
	The deceased are Gopal Haldar, 36, and Ranjit Jana, 65. Haldars body has been sent for post-mortem but Jana was cremated without a post-mortem.         
	The death certificate of Jana, who died at National Medical College and Hospital, says the death was caused by acute pancreatitis, but local residents alleged he had consumed illicit liquor.        
	Jana was a resident of BG Press Colony and Gopal lived in Rabindra Nagar. The other deaths occurred in Mahestala, on the southern city fringes.        
	We suspect Gopal died after consuming spurious liquor. So we put pressure on police to arrange for a post-mortem, said Anjan Das, the local Trinamul councillor.        
	Two persons  Mustaq Ahmed and Istaq Ahmed  were arrested in Baruipur for selling country liquor without a licence and 200 litres of hooch were seized from the area. The police alleged the duo supplied illicit liquor to Mahestala and other places.

	Eight-year-old Pramita Aich, the first child cancer patient in eastern India to undergo a stem cell transplant, can resume her dance classes she was forced to quit in August last year.        
	The girl, who went home from Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Cancer Research Institute on Thursday, has been fully cured of the disease, said medical director Ashis Mukherjee.         
	Pramita is also the first solid organ cancer patient in the region to be cured by stem cell transplant, Mukherjee added.        
	The little girl had to discontinue school last October after she started suffering from pain in her thighs and abdomen. First she stopped going to dance classes and eventually dropped out of school. Then her eyeballs started to protrude, which scared us, said the girls father Prantik, who works in a private firm.        
	The girl was taken to Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, where she was diagnosed with neuroblastoma (a tumour of the adrenal gland). She was in Stage IV of the disease, which had by then spread to multiple bones, bone marrow and eyes.        
	The parents, however, could not continue her treatment in Mumbai and returned to Calcutta, where they got her admitted to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Cancer Research Institute.        
	She was not responding to chemotherapy. So, we decided to go for stem cell transplant, said Mukherjee.        
	The stem cells were sourced from bone marrow which was collected from her backbone under general anaesthesia and preserved at minus 80 degree Celsius. She was kept in a special room and administered high doses of chemotherapy, following which the stem cells were transfused into her on April 19, one month after they had been drawn out.        
	The Dum Dum girl who has been under observation for two months said she was not feeling the pain any more. I want to resume my Rabindranritya lessons as soon as possible and play kitkit (hopscotch) with my friends. The doctors assured her parents that the dance classes could start after the Puja.

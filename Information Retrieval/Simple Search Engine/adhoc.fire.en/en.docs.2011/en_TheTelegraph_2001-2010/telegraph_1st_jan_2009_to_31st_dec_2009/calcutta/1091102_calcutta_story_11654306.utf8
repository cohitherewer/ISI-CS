          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) could become the countrys first green university if plans for a Rs 20-crore green technology centre gets the Centres nod.         
	Besu vice-chancellor Ajay K. Ray met Union human resource development minister Kapil Sibal last month with a detailed proposal for the centre.        
	With energy consumption and greenhouse emission reduction becoming the focal point of all climate talks, we are carrying out research in renewable energy like solar and wind energy as well as fuel-cell technology to cut down emission, said Ray. The university is also undergoing an energy audit and is planning to reduce energy consumption by 10 per cent in a year.         
	The green technology centre will be a part of the proposed Centre of Excellence for Green Energy and Sensor Systems. It will introduce, practise and expand a sensible comprehensive strategy of green technology (including green energy and sensor systems), education and research in phases to improve lifestyle in environmentally-friendly and non-polluting ways.        
	The establishment of the centre is significant with the Union government slated to launch Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission, which aims to generate 20,000MW of solar power by 2020, on November 14.        
	As part of the green technology centre, the university will erect a green building that will use green technology and green software developed in collaboration with IBM.        
	Besu will get technical help for the project from the central governments department of science and technology, state governments renewable energy development agency and IT companies like IBM, PCS, Metalogic Systems and Consultant Service Engineering, said the vice-chancellor.        
	We are looking for funds from various sources, he added.         
	The centre will take a multi-disciplinary approach to green energy research, according to professor N.R. Bandopadhyay, the convener of the programme.The centre is slated to offer MTech courses in green energy, sensor science and technology and industry-oriented short-term training courses.

                                                                                                               Last rites in Kullu
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The last rites of the seven tourists who died in an accident in Himachal Pradesh on Wednesday will be performed in Kullu.         
	The family members of the victims left for Chandigarh on Thursday afternoon on their way to Kullu.        
	It will be difficult to bring down the bodies to Calcutta. So, we have been advised to go there for cremation, said Adhir Sen, a colleague of some of the members of the tourist party. A family member of one of the victims said he had been told that the bodies had decomposed.        
	Six tourists from Calcutta and one from Barrackpore died when the bus they were travelling in rolled into a 1,000ft-deep gorge in Banjar sub-division of Kullu. Six others in the bus survived, though four of them were critically injured and admitted to a local hospital and later shifted to a hospital in Chandigarh. Their condition was stable.        
	Five other members of the group were travelling in a Tata Sumo behind the bus. The 18-member group had left the city on April 20 and was scheduled to return on May 10.        
	Those who died were Ankur Pakrashi and his 10-year-old daughter Suhita, Sashanka Shekhar Chakraborty and his wife Amrita, Archana Pal and her 12-year-old daughter Sayoni and Ganapati Majumdar. Ankur, Sashanka and Ganapati were employees of BSNL.        
	We were left unscathed but my friend Sarajit lost his wife Archana and daughter Sayoni. He is inconsolable, Subodh Pal, who was travelling in the Sumo, said over the phone from Kullu.        
	State government officials are coordinating with their Haryana counterparts to help the family members of the deceased.        
	The six injured and the five who were travelling in the second vehicle will reach Delhi on Sunday after performing the last rites of the deceased, said an official in the chief ministers secretariat.        
	Bhuban Goswami, a colleague of Ankur, said his friends 75-year-old mother, in the dark about the mishap, was waiting for the return of her son, daughter-in-law and two grand-daughters.

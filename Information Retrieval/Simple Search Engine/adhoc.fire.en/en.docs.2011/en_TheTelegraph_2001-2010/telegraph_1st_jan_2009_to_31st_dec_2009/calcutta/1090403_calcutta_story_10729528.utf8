The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Two faces of Trinamul on walls
                                                                                                               Two faces of Trinamul on walls
  - Some private premises spared but party targets a polling booth					 					                                                  
	In some pockets of Calcutta South, Trinamul Congress councillors have directed the partys paintbrush brigade to spare private walls and spread the poll message with banners and festoons only. But if you thought Trinamul was turning over a new leaf, think again. The familiar leaf-and-flower symbol of the party adorns the wall of an Urdu-medium school that has been designated a polling booth. Metro takes a look at the two sides of Trinamul              
	GOOD TRINAMUL
  Manoharpukur Road        
	What we saw: Flags tied to lamp posts and banners, mainly of Trinamul, line this stretch of ward No. 84. Some private walls contain graffiti urging voters to elect CPM candidate Rabin Deb, but theres not one in the Trinamul colours.        
	What we heard: We discontinued the practice of writing graffiti long ago. Graffiti has little impact on election results. It may influence a section of unlettered people  they identify the symbols  but not the rest of the electorate. Flex, banners and posters are alternatives to graffiti, says ward councillor Anup Chatterjee of the Trinamul Congress.

	What we saw: Not a single stroke of the poll paintbrush was visible in the para where Jyoti Basu used to live. Even election-related festoons and flags are conspicuous by their absence.        
	What we heard: We are very lucky to be living in a locality where wall writing is not in vogue. When I see other places in Calcutta, I shudder, says Sona Mukherjee, an elderly resident of the area.         
	Citizens feel humiliated when political parties dont respect their rights. But house owners in my locality are a happy lot, asserts Dipti Majumdar, the local Trinamul councillor.         
	Rivalspeak: We were unaware that Trinamul has decided not to write graffiti on walls in Calcutta South. Its a gimmick, of course. Had it been otherwise, they wouldnt write on walls anywhere, claims CPM leader Tapan Datta.        
	We are following the Election Commissions rules about taking permission and thats why you see less graffiti this time, he adds.               
	BAD TRINAMUL        
	A winding lane in Karaya, off Bright Street, leads to Chamru Khansama Lane (Urdu) GSFP School. Just below the small board bearing the schools name is the Trinamul Congress symbol in green and orange on a whitewashed patch of the front wall. The letters in black atop the symbol read TMC.        
	The school is a government-sponsored free primary institute that has been designated polling booth No. 100 of Calcutta South.         
	So, what makes the Trinamul graffiti on the school wall illegal?        
	Being a government-sponsored free primary school, it is a public building and any election graffiti on those walls will be treated as a violation of the model code of conduct, says chief electoral officer Debashis Sen.        
	The rule book states that no wall writing, pasting of posters/papers or defacement in any other form, or erecting/displaying of cutouts, hoardings, banners flags etc, shall be permitted on any government premise (including civil structures therein).         
	According to trader Mohammed Ikram, the Trinamul graffiti was written just over a week ago.         
	A group of Trinamul supporters turned up, painted the wall white and then the symbol. They were in no hurry and took their time to finish the job. Everyone saw them but nobody protested. The school was closed and so no one from the school was around, he recalls.        
	The returning officer is supposed to issue a notice to the offender to whitewash a defaced wall whenever he/she receives a complaint.        
	 If the party does not respond promptly, the authorities will get the wall whitewashed and the expenses incurred in the process will be recovered from those responsible for the defacement.         
	The amount will also be added to the election expenditure of the candidate concerned, and action can be initiated to prosecute the offender under Section 202 of the CMC Act of 1980, which stipulates up to six months in prison and a fine of Rs 50,000.        
	If the polling booth is not a government building, then the graffiti is allowed to stay till 48 hours before the end of the voting process.         
	In Calcutta that will be till 5pm on May 11, after which either the party or the election officials must ensure that the walls are wiped clean.

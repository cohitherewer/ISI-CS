The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Only Bolly on plex platter   Juggle film amp; festivity
                                                                                                               Only Bolly on plex platter   Juggle film amp; festivity
  - Fireworks Friday with 200 shows of three releases          PRIYANKA ROY                                                          Blue: Underwater stunts in Rs 120cr film with Akshay, Sanjay, Lara Kylie(Top)  Main Aurr Mrs Khanna: Salman romances Kareena(Middle)  All The Best: A star-studded comedy from the Golmaal team(Below)      
	If its big, its got to be Bollywood. It hardly gets bigger than the Diwali weekend and so the plexes are going all-Bolly, with three brand new biggies starring Akshay Kumar and Salman Khan, Kareena Kapoor and Bipasha Basu.        
	Fireworks Friday has close to 200 shows lined up for Blue, All The Best and Main Aurr Mrs Khanna at the eight Calcutta plexes, with not a single Hollywood movie on beam and a lone Tollywood one with a solitary show.         
	Diwali has traditionally been boom time for Bollywood films. The three films belong to different genres and we look forward to a chock-a-block weekend, said Rishi Negi of Fame Cinemas, which has 60 shows for the new releases.        
	Both Diwali 2008 films, Fashion and Golmaal Returns, had struck box-office gold and the three-in-one Bolly mix this weekend guarantees a crowd crush. Advance bookings opened on Tuesday and the queues have been long, said Virendra Marya of INOX.                          
	The choices range from the Rs 120 crore underwater   
	antics in Blue to the romance of Main Aurr Mrs Khanna to the comic capers of All The Best. I hope to catch all the three releases. The trick lies in balancing family gatherings and the movies this weekend, says event manager and Bolly buff Amit Hathiramani.  
	It will be easier for the likes of Amit to do the juggling act now with Calcutta getting its first midnight movie show. Main Aurr Mrs Khanna at Fame South City has an 11.55pm show, a first for a city plex. Young couples can give partying a miss and drop in for a movie, said Negi of Fame.

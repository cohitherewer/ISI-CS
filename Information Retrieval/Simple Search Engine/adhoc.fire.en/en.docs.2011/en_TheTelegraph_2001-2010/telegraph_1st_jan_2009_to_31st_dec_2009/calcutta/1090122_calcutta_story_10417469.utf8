                      Uncommon art                    A technique that fuses coloured glass powder onto a metal surface under high temperature, enamelling has originally been associated with jewellery and ecclesiastical items. Amal Ghoshs engagement with enamels is, however, an extremely diverse and specialised one, encompassing a wide range of styles, textures and themes. His works are a fundamental expression of his artistic ideas, eloquently speaking to the audience through a consistent and coherent visual vocabulary. Peter Daglishs incisive linocuts hark back to the graphics of Hogarth and Daumier. Brimming with the fineness and foibles of the human condition, his works are both perceptive and funny. Exploring the earthy and the quotidian as a contrast to the spiritual, he is able to perceive incongruous relationships and express them pointedly. Ultimately, they offer a relentless scrutiny of the world, ranging from scathing social commentary to opulent ornamentalism. At the ongoing show of their works, Ghosh and Daglish showcase themes like humour, lost time, youthful beauty and eternal desire, stimulating the visual and intellectual appetite of the art lover.                  Event: An exhibition of enamels by Amal Ghosh and linocuts by Peter Daglish When: Till January 31 (except Sunday); 11 am - 7 pm Where: Ganges Art Gallery, 33A Jatin Das Road

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Govt delay in Maidan matter
                                                                                                               Govt delay in Maidan matter
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Remains of the DYFI rally on the Maidan                                  
	The battle for the citys lungs was caught in red tape on Wednesday with the government failing to file an affidavit on a recent assault on the Maidan by a red army because of a communication gap between its lawyer and police.         
	Government counsel Tulshidas Maity told the high court that he hadnt received any information from the police about the rally that was organised by the Democratic Youth Federation of India on December 20 last year.         
	Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya and Justice Rudrendu Narayan Banerjee werent convinced by the explanation but decided to give the government one last chance to file an affidavit, failing which the bench would assume that the administration has nothing to say on the issue.        
	The new deadline expires in a week but the date for the next hearing is February 9, a day after a proposed CPM rally on the Maidan.        
	The last time the rally brigade had set foot on the Maidan  on December 20  it cooked up a storm that left the greens in tatters. Rice and chicken curry were cooked for the rallyists in giant chullahs in violation of a high court-imposed ban on using ovens in the open within a three-km radius of the Victoria Memorial.        
	The CPMs youth wing also lined up 130-odd vehicles despite parking in the area being illegal and drilled more than 1,000 holes on the greens to put up barricades and install loudspeakers.        
	Green activist Subhas Dutta, who went to court with a fresh save-Maidan plea after that rally, said on Wednesday that he suspected the government had no intention of protecting the citys largest patch of green. The next hearing was to have been held on February 4 but the governments lawyer requested that it be postponed by around a week because another rally has been planned on February 8.        
	The army is the main custodian of the Maidan.         
	According to a high court order issued on May 8 last year, the army is supposed to take a written undertaking from every party or organisation holding a rally on the Maidan that all environment-protection guidelines would be adhered to.         
	The order was in response to a petition filed by Dutta after a CPM rally had mauled the Maidan in January 2008.

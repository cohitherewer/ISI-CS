The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A mosquitos diet
                                                                                                               A mosquitos diet
                                              
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) is feeding Glucon-D to mosquitoes. If only to combat vector-borne diseases like malaria, dengue, chikungunya and Japanese encephalitis.         
	Since all the species of a particular genus of mosquito do not spread these diseases and it is difficult to identify the germ-carrying species at the larva stage, the vector control wing of the civic body has set up a laboratory to rear larvae to identify them better.        
	Entomologists have reared about 1,000 mosquitoes at the Moulali laboratory, said chief municipal health officer DebDwaipayan Chattopadhyay. About 60 per cent of these were identified as carriers of dengue (species: Aedes aegypti) and some 30 per cent of malaria (species: Anopheles stephensi).        
	A mosquito cage resembles a dolls cot under a see-through mosquito net. A small pot teeming with larvae is kept at one end of the cot and a piece of cotton wool dipped in Glucon-D is placed at the other end. After circling the cage a couple of times, the young adults swoop down on the cotton swab and draw on the glucose.        
	The CMCs chief entomologist Debashis Biswas said that contrary to popular belief, mosquitoes do not drink blood to feed themselves. They feed mostly on fruit juices, hence the glucose diet at the lab.         
	Female mosquitoes need mammalian blood to fertilise their eggs. Its this frantic desire for propagation that leads them to bite us, draw blood and spread diseases in the process. That wouldnt console humans though.         
	Mans best friend         
	A little hope for stray dogs. The Foundation for Animal Welfare and Environmental Studies inaugurated an animal shelter and clinic at Hariharpur, Khas Mallik (South 24- Parganas) on August 12. Currently we are taking care of six dogs and we plan to start mobile camps soon in nearby areas, says Bonani Ghosh, the commissioner of income tax and a trustee member. Outdoor facilities are already available at the clinic.                  
	Two days later, a discussion was held at the Indian Council for Cultural Research. Green activist Subhash Dutta stressed how everyone has to make daily life more environment-friendly. Filmmaker Sekhar Das spoke of the stray dog Kalu in his locality who with his friends keeps the area clean by eating roadside leftovers and guards the area.         
	Saugata Roy, the minister of state for urban development, said strays that bite humans and cause rabies should alert us to the poverty of the people who cannot afford anti-rabies injections.         
	Hence while animals are important so are human lives. This was met with some resistance from dog lovers who claimed many rodents cause more dangerous diseases.         
	A short film, Life on the Street, was screened. There are plans to open a crematorium in the city if land is available.

	Magic Anto                   
	A gifted musician, an ever-giving soul with a peace-loving heart: Anto Menezes (picture left), who passed away on August 12, 2009, was one in a million. Satyajit Ray had called him a genius, R.D. Burman one of the finest jazz musicians, and Salil Choudhury magic Anto.        
	Anto Menezes, pianist, composer and performer, had played for almost five decades. His love for music coupled with the bouncing, rhythmic sticks of the vibraphone made him an outstanding musician.         
	He came to Calcutta from Goa. Satyajit Ray could never think of his films music without the two As  Aloke Nath Dey, a flautist who was the music conductor for all Ray films, and Anto Menezes. Sudhin Dasguptas music too was married to his playful sticks. During the Seventies, Bengali films were incomplete without the music of Anto Menezes.         
	He had collaborated with Herbie Hancock when he came to India.        
	Musicians such as Amyt Dutta, Monojit Dutta, Nondon Bagchi, Lew Hilt, Benu Chatterjee and Sumit Ramachandran speak of him as an immense inspiration. I am indebted to him for my knowledge of modern harmony and for enhancing my latent capabilities. He had the Goan musicians indigenous musical tonality.         
	Anto Menezes, despite being a master of jazz and blues, never hankered after money or fame. I dont want to sound sad as our ever-smiling Anthony Wolfgang Menezes might not have wanted tears. But on behalf of all musicians, I pay this homage to the master.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Plea to return price of freedom
                                                                                                               Plea to return price of freedom
          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                          Milan Molla on Tuesday. (Pradip Sanyal)                                  
	Police may have restored Milan Mollas honour but they havent returned his money.        
	Milan, a 25-year-old slum-dweller arrested on false charges and forced to bribe police to avoid being branded a terrorist, told Metro on Tuesday that he was in debt and needed the Rs 35,000 that was extorted from his family in August last year.        
	Six months have elapsed since senior police officers assured us that we would get back the money. We havent received a paise yet. My mother had borrowed Rs 35,000 from three persons to pay the police for my freedom and they now want their money back, said the youth, who sells stationery and scrap in Cossipore.        
	Milans travails began on August 6, three days after a freak blast in which he lost his younger brother Deedar, cousins Ramzan and Shaqib, and granduncle Hasan.        
	A police team raided his shanty that day and took him to a port division outpost, where they threatened to book him on charges of triggering the blast. The policemen, led by sub-inspector Prashanta Majumdar, demanded Rs 1.5 lakh to set him free.        
	The blast in Cossipore on August 3 had actually occurred when Deedar and Ramzan were trying to break open a discarded shell they had brought home from the banks of the Hooghly. Commissioner of police Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti and other senior officials had ruled out the hand of terrorists in the blast that very night.        
	After Metro blew the lid off the police bid to brand Milan a terrorist, he was acquitted of all charges and Majumdar was identified as the officer who had tried to frame him. The sub-inspector was suspended from service in September and an inquiry was ordered to find out if he had pocketed the Rs 35,000 alone or shared it with colleagues.        
	According to Milan, two officers from North Port police station visited his shanty three months ago to confirm that his mother had paid Majumdar Rs 35,000.        
	 The officers spoke to my father-in-law Ayub, my relative Musha Ali and the local trader from whom my mother had borrowed money to get me out of the lock-up. They were asked to sign a paper confirming that they had contributed the money, he said.        
	The two policemen also spoke to a neighbour who had accompanied Milans mother, Anwara Bibi, to the port outpost and was a witness to Majumdar accepting the bribe.        
	We are poor people. The police should return the money now that Majumdar is in the dock, said Milan.        
	Additional commissioner of police Shivaji Ghosh, who had led the inquiry, said he wasnt responsible for the recovery of the money that Majumdar had extorted from the Molla family. Departmental proceedings are underway. I dont know how the money will be recovered, even if he is proved guilty. There is a separate procedure for that.        
	Milan, who lives with wife Babita, one-and-a-half-year-old son Shabbir and mother Anwara in a two-room tenement, still shudders at the thought of what could have happened. I thank all those people who took up my case. I would probably have been rotting in jail had they not intervened, he said.        
	Pradip Singh, the businessman who had helped Milans mother meet CPM leader Mohammad Salim and lodge a complaint, said it was a shame that the police hadnt returned the money that the Molla family was forced to pay.         
	Had the family been financially better off, I am sure they could have dragged the police to court, he added.

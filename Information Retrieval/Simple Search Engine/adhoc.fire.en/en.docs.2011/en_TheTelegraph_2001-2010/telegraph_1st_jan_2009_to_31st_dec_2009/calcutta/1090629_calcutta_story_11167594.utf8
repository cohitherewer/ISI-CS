                                                                                                               Roy Burman perjury case adjourned
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The second additional sessions judge of the Alipore court, Abdul Kuddus, on Friday adjourned the hearing of the perjury cases against eight of footwear baron Partha Pratim Roy Burmans family members, friends and colleagues till August 8.        
	The eight allegedly made false statements in court during the trial of Parthas abduction case and were declared hostile by the Criminal Investigation Department.        
	They had told investigators that a ransom of Rs 3.75 crore was paid to Aftab Ansari and his associates to secure Partha Roy Burmans release but later denied the statements in court. The perjury cases were hence moved against them, said Nabakumar Ghosh, the public prosecutor.        
	The eight are Parthas brother Siddhartha, brother-in-law Ushinar Ghosh, cousin Suman Roy Burman, nephew Manas Roy, employees of his company Raju Banerjee and Tapan Basu and friends Nirmal Bhattacharya and Prasun Chakraborty.         
	Lawyers have questioned why Partha himself was not charged with perjury.

                                                                                                               Homemaker held 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two youths and a homemaker have been arrested in connection with the attack on a man in Beniapukur late on Sunday. Police said Sheikh Danish, a criminal, and his aide Mohammad Azhar Kamal, were hired by 44-year-old Shamshad Begum to threaten a resident of Lynton Street, Ajim Alam Chowdhury, 39. The goons attacked Chowdhury on Sunday and shot at him.         
	The duo beat up Chowdhury and when he resisted, Danish shot him in the leg before fleeing. Chowdhury was hit on his left thigh and has been admitted to CMRI, said an officer.        
	A probe revealed Shamshad Begum, also a resident of Lynton Street, bore a grudge against Chowdhury for scuttling the marriage of her niece with his brother-in-law Babar.         
	Shamshad Begums niece had an affair with Babar for the past two years and he had promised to marry her. But recently Babar refused to marry the girl and he was supported by Chowdhury. This angered Shamshad Begum, said the officer.         
	The officer said the deal was struck at Rs 43,000. Shamshad Begum told us she had asked Danish to threaten Chowdhury but not to kill him, said the officer.

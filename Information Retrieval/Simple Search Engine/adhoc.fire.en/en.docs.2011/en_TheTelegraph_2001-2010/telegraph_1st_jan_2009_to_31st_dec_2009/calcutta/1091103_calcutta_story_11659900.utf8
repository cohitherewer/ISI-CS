  - Police take stock of surveillance gadgets and private guards           KINSUK BASU                                  
	The Maoist strike in West Midnapores Sankrail has prompted the city police to review the security of banks and take steps to prevent a similar raid.        
	On October 20, armed Maoists looted the Sankrail branch of a nationalised bank before raiding the adjacent police station, killing two cops and taking officer-in-charge Atindranath Datta hostage.        
	The Lalbazar top brass, wary of a rerun of the attack in Calcutta, have asked the OCs of all 48 police stations in the city to visit the banks in their respective areas and send reports on security loopholes.        
	The OCs, armed with a checklist, will find out whether the banks have hotlines with the police, identify the branches that have currency chests and whether the CCTV cameras are functioning.        
	The reports, called security history sheet in police parlance, will mention the number of entry and exit points and guards deployed in each bank and encroachments, if any, outside. The reports will also state whether the guards are from private agencies or the police force.        
	The drive follows a meeting between the police and senior officials from private and government banks at Lalbazar on October 23. The bank officials were briefed about the polices stock-taking measures and asked to increase vigilance on their premises.        
	Post-Sankrail, we have to rethink bank security. Transactions of huge amounts take place in banks every day and merely placing two guards at the gates or running customary checks is not enough, said a senior IPS officer.        
	During recent visits to some private and nationalised banks, the police officers had pointed lack of proper management of the surveillance gadgets installed in banks and monitoring of the recorded footage. In many branches, the cops noticed that CCTV cameras were placed facing the light and the images captured were too dark.        
	We have observed that sometimes security guards do not react even if people enter banks wearing helmets or roam around aimlessly, pointed out a senior officer.        
	He added that often guards were not posted at strategic points and on many occasions, they lacked a sense of security.        
	The bank representatives told the police that in most cases bank security was outsourced to private agencies. They also admitted that managing daily transactions left bank officials with little time to oversee if all aspects of security had been adequately covered.        
	We are open to any move to upgrade security, a private bank official told the police .

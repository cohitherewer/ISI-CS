The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mob fury over dowry death
                                                                                                               Mob fury over dowry death
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The damaged house (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                  
	A mob tore down a wall and the tin roof of a house in Sarsuna, near Behala, after a 21-year-old homemaker, who lived there and was allegedly set on fire by her in-laws, died in hospital on Monday morning.         
	Tumpa Adhikari was found in flames in the Jibanananda Nagar house on Wednesday, minutes after neighbours had foiled an alleged attempt by her husband and his parents to set her ablaze.        
	Residents admitted Tumpa to National Medical College, where she died. When the news reached the area, a mob forced its way into the house, ransacked rooms and handed over Tumpas mother-in-law Menoka to police. She was arrested on the basis of a complaint by neighbours. Tumpas husband Rabin, a transport operator, and father-in-law Mohan are absconding, said the police.        
	Around 1pm on Wednesday, we had rushed to the Adhikaris house hearing Tumpas cries and found that her in-laws had doused her in kerosene. We poured water on her, reprimanded her in-laws and came back. Within 15 minutes, they set her on fire, said Poornima Mondal, a neighbour.        
	The family used to regularly torture Tumpa for dowry, said another resident. Neighbours said they had to intervene several times to save Tumpa from her in-laws. According to them, she had run away a number of times to her parents home in Dharapara in the past six months but was brought back by Mohan.

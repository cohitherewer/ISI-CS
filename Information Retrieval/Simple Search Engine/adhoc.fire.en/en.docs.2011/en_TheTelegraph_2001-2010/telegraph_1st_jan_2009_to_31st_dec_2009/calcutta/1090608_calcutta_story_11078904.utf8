                The inspector general of police (organisation), Suman Bala Sahu, on Sunday met the eight-year-old domestic help who was allegedly beaten up by deputy inspector general (planning and welfare) Basudeb Bag at his Andul residence on Saturday. Sahu spoke to the girl and her father for 45 minutes at a Liluah home. Police recorded a general diary after residents of Andul put up a roadblock near Nazirgunge investigation centre on Saturday night. Bag was summoned to the investigation centre and spent two hours there.    A fire broke out in a footwear godown in Abinash Chowdhury Lane in Topsia on Sunday afternoon. Twelve tenders took over three hours to douse the flames. Residents spotted smoke billowing out of the godown and called the fire brigade. The fire brigade said the godown, which had no electricity connection, was put to use recently. The extent of loss is yet to be determined.     An unidentified man in his late 40s was found dead in a makeshift CPM party office, set up before the general elections, near the Kona Expressway and NH 6 crossing on Sunday. Police said local residents noticed the man lying in the office. The body bore no signs of injury. It has been sent for post-mortem.    A 22-year-old help of a lorry driver died late on Saturday after being run over on Circular Garden Reach Road. Cops said Jhinak Ram was standing in front of the lorry while some men were pushing it to start its engine. The driver lost control once the vehicle started. Ram was declared dead at SSKM Hospital.    A peon of a private firm in Ballygunge was arrested early on Sunday for stealing Rs 1.07 lakh from the office two days ago. Police said Raju Bera used to stay in the office. He allegedly broke open the cash box and decamped with the money. He was picked up from his ancestral home at Bhupatinagar in East Midnapore. The money was found buried under the floor of his room.     DYFI supporters put up a blockade at the Rashbehari Avenue crossing for an hour from 12.30pm on Sunday to protest an alleged attack by local Trinamul Congress activists on CPM cadres. The blockade was lifted after police intervened.

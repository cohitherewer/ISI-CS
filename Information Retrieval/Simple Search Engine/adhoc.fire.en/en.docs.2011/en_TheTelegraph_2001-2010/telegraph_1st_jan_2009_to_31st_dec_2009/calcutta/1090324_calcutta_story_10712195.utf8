The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Trauma care caught in red tape 
                                                                                                               Trauma care caught in red tape

	Calcuttas first government trauma care unit is stillborn.        
	The unit, which was supposed to come up at SSKM but didnt because of poor logistics, will not be set up at Medical College and Hospital either. According to officials of the health department, the project has been shelved for all practical purposes.        
	Space and accessibility are the two problems being cited for the Delhi-sponsored project still not getting off the ground despite being planned in 2007.        
	It was shifted from SSKM to Medical College and Hospital over a year ago because experts had reservations about the space that was available at the original site. A detailed study has found Medical College and Hospital unsuitable, too, S.N. Banerjee, the director of medical education, told Metro on Monday.         
	Banerjee said the state government was now planning an independent trauma care centre at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital.        
	Some private hospitals in the city have trauma care centres and specialists but these facilities are expensive. The absence of a government centre affects accident victims the most.        
	Trauma care was the difference in Dipna Karmakar surviving and Saheli Roy dying after accidents on the EM Bypass within three months of each other last year. Critically injured Dipna, 20, survived because she received prompt trauma care in a private hospital. Saheli, an airline employee, was taken to NRS hospital, where she lay bleeding for two hours before a general surgeon examined her. She died the same night.         
	The IIT Kharagpur student who died on Sunday might also have survived with prompt trauma care, a specialist said.        
	Health department officials blame Delhi for the delay in Calcutta getting a government trauma care centre. The unit would have become operational this year had everything been implemented according to plan, an official said.         
	In late 2007, a team from the National Highways Authority of India and trauma care specialists from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi had jointly conducted a survey at SSKM Hospital to identify the site for the proposed unit.        
	When SSKM was rejected, the state government offered Medical College and Hospital as an alternative. But road congestion sealed the second sites fate. A trauma care centre should ideally be in a location that can be easily accessed. The roads on either flank of Medical College and Hospital, College Street and Chittaranjan Avenue, are congested, Banerjee said.        
	SSKM and RG Kar are said to be more easily accessible.

          SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE                              
	A 39-year-old taxi driver on Sunday returned two bags containing goods worth over Rs 10,000 and Rs 15,000 that a family had left behind in the boot.         
	Suvajit Biswas, the taxi driver, ferried garment trader Mohammad Azim, his wife and son from Howrah station to their Patuli home in the morning.The next passenger, while keeping his luggage in the boot, saw the bags left behind by the family and alerted Suvajit.        
	The bags contained new clothes, a Nokia phone and a bundle of cash, said Suvajit. He drove to the Kalindi taxi stand soon after finding the bag.        
	When the cellphone ran out of charge, Suvajit removed the SIM card and put it in the phone of a taxi union leader.         
	We dialled the number stored under home in the contacts list of the phone. Azim himself answered the phone, said the leader.         
	I was in a hurry and forgot the bags. I am grateful to Suvajit for returning the bags. Had he not done so, I would have lost the money, which I borrowed for business purposes, said Azim.         
	Cop suspended: A constable of Bidhannagar North police station was suspended on Sunday for drinking while on duty near AE market in Salt Lake. Residents lodged a complaint against the constable.

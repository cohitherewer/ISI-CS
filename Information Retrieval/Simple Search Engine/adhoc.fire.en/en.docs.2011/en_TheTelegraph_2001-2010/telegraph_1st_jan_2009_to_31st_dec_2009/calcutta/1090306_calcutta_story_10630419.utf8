The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Auto blame game in high court 
                                                                                                               Auto blame game in high court 
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta High Court has given the government and auto operators seven days to remove some hurdles that have slowed down the phaseout of polluting three-wheelers.        
	The state government on Thursday blamed everyone but itself for the tardy progress of the scheme to replace two-stroke autos.        
	Advocate-general Balai Ray said in the governments first status report since the January 9 hearing that most auto operators hadnt rectified wrong information in their applications despite repeated reminders.        
	He next targeted the banks, saying they were unnecessarily delaying the process of sanctioning loans to auto operators whose applications for new vehicles had been cleared by the transport department.         
	Ray also accused oil companies of not opening enough LPG outlets to make the switch from petrol/katatel (adulterated fuel) to clean fuel feasible.        
	The advocate-general claimed that the government wasnt in any way responsible for only 982 of the nearly 40,000 registered two-stroke autos being replaced so far. We have received 19,548 applications, of which 17,319 contain incorrect information. The rest have been cleared and sent to the banks (Allahabad Bank and United Bank).        
	Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice P.C. Ghosh then set the deadline. We will discuss the issue again on March 17, the bench said.

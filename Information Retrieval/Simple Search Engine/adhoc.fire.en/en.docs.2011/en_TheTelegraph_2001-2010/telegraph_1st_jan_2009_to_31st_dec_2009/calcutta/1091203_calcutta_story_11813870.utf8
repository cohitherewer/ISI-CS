	Appointment of teachers to primary schools in North 24-Parganas is set to resume with the authorities promising to abide by the recruitment criteria fixed by the high court.         
	Recruitment would have started earlier  the process is already underway in the rest of Bengal  had some candidates not moved court over the eligibility norms.        
	On September 23, the high court directed the North 24-Parganas Primary School Council to fill posts vacant since 2006 with eligible candidates who had applied for jobs in 2006. The councils lawyer told the court on Wednesday that all norms would be followed.        
	In 2008, the high court had declared certificates from teachers training institutes not approved by the National Council for Teacher Education as invalid. The government revised the criteria for primary schoolteachers last August and the North 24-Parganas Primary School Council issued a circular notifying the amended rules.        
	But in mid-August, some candidates who had applied for teachers jobs in 2006 moved the high court against the rule. Now even candidates who have just cleared Madhyamik are eligible for jobs in primary schools, their lawyers argued.        
	The court ruled in their favour. There were 3,900 vacant posts in primary schools in North 24-Parganas in 2006. The number stands at 7,500 now.

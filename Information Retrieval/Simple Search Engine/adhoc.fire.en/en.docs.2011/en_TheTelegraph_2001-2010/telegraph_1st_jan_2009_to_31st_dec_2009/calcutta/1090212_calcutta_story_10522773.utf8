The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Caution is the key
                                                                                                                   Caution is the key
										                              Firefighters demonstrate safety measures at the RBU seminar 		               
	In the wake of the recent terror attacks, caution is the buzzword. Keeping this in mind, the security department of Rabindra Bharati University (RBU) held a seminar-cum-workshop on threat perception on the Emerald Bower campus in January.         
	Experts from the police and fire services departments detailed the necessary measures that should be taken to avert a crisis.         
	Subrata Mitra, the deputy commissioner of police (security), advised beefing up security on campus. He suggested an array of measures, including installing closed-circuit cameras with a minimum storing system of 15 days, caller-identification facility for important telephone lines, separate parking enclosures under constant surveillance and regular cleaning of dustbins.         
	If anybody finds explosives, the priority should be to vacate the place immediately, inform the police and not panic, said Mitra.         
	Pratim Chatterjee, the minister of fire and emergency services, highlighted the need to provide fire safety education to students from classes V to IX.         
	Gopal Bhattacharya, the director of fire and emergency services, pointed out the lapses in the seminar pandal that had just one entrance and exit. With more than 500 people here, the place should have a minimum of four exits, he said. There should also be a fire detection system with its signal in the vice -chancellors room, said Bhattacharya.         
	Bomb threats are a reality today. We learnt simple ways of being cautious, said Sanjib Basu, a student.

	Cast the right spell                  Students found themselves in a maze of words at the 10th edition of SPELLINC, an inter-school spelling competition held at Kala Mandir on January 28.       
	After five rounds of word dissection (that included spelling them right, making words from a jumble of letters and solving crossword puzzles), Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School emerged victorious, defeating three-time winner Modern High School for Girls.The contest, meant for classes VIII to X, gained momentum in the rapid-fire round where the teams had to spell aloud a volley of words in 40 seconds.         
	Satyaki Majumdar from Calcutta Boys School proved to be a master at the game, as he rattled off spellings at breathtaking speed. With the scores undeclared till the very end, tension prevailed throughout the contest. The jokes cracked by Mir, the anchor of the show, came as a welcome break.        
	Members of the winning team got a gift cheque and voucher of Rs 5,000 each, the first runner-up a cheque and voucher of Rs 2,500 each, while the second runner-up (Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Salt Lake) got a cheque and voucher of Rs 1,500. The winning schools also got gift vouchers for Rs 25,000, Rs 15,000 and Rs 10,000, respectively. The other finalists were Dolna Day School, La Martiniere for Boys, Birla High School for Girls, Calcutta Boys School and Apeejay School, Park Street.         
	In the initial stages, spelling tests were held in 150 schools across the state. Four hundred and fifty students (three from each school) participated in the preliminary round on January 28. The top eight made it to the finals.         
	Deepak Jalan, the managing director of Linc Pen and Plastics, gave away the prizes. Over the years, the number of participating schools has increased, he noted. The number has risen from 75 in 1999 to 150 in 2008.

	CHIT CHAT                  Alakananda Ray   at the reunion      
	Back to school         
	Former students of Modern High School (MHS) dancers Priti Patel and Alakananda Ray and singer Alka Yagnik were felicitated by principal Devi Kar at the old girls reunion in January. I have received many accolades. But being recognised by my school is the highest, said Patel. Ray remembered her math teacher asking: Do you think youre going to dance all your life? Returning to her school 10 years later, she was told by the same teacher that she was proud of her ex-student. Yagnik could not attend the reunion. The event ended with a debate on There is no such thing as a noble profession.        Cultural convention   
	Auxilium Convent, Dum Dum, celebrated the inauguration of its golden jubilee on January 24. Swapan Kumar Sarkar, the secretary of the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education, was chief guest. The students put up a short cultural programme on the theme, Fifty

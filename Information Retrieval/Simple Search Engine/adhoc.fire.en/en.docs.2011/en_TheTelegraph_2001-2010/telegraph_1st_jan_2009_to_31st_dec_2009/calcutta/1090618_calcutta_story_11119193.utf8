                      Man of many parts                    Tall, well-built, with a supple and statuesque body, he was additionally endowed with a bass voice of a range and resonance rare among the best actors of his time. He used these assets assiduously to add to his outstanding histrionic skills. The result was a towering stage presence that few of his contemporaries could match. Ajitesh Bandopadhyay was an actor and a dramatist who will always be remembered for his outstanding contribution to Indian theatre. He adapted foreign texts and diluted their foreignness by transforming them into convincing Bengali drama. Most of them proved popular with the public and critics, extending the horizon of Bengali viewers expectations about theatrical ideas. Among the diverse array of dramatists from whose works he adapted, Bandopadhyay was most comfortable with Chekhov and Brecht. Some of them were truly memorable: Natyakarer Sandhaney Chhati Charitra (Pirandellos Six Characters in Search of an Author) in 1961, Manjari Aamer Manjari (Chekhovs Cherry Orchard) in 1964, Sher Afghan (Pirandellos Henry IV) in 1966, Tin Paysar Pala (Brechts Three Penny Opera) in 1969 and Bhalo Manush (Brechts Good Person of Setzuan) in 1974. Conceived by media personality Sujoy Prosad Chatterjee and curated by theatre thespian Biplab Dasgupta, Theatrum is a tribute to this great dramaturge who revolutionised the concept of world theatre on the Bengali stage and ruled it in his inimitable style.This evenings programme marks the beginning of a year-long project that would showcase some of the best works of playwrights across the globe through dramatised readings by acclaimed theatre personalities of Calcutta. The readings will be preceded by talks by eminent personalities who would familiarise the dramatist to the audience.

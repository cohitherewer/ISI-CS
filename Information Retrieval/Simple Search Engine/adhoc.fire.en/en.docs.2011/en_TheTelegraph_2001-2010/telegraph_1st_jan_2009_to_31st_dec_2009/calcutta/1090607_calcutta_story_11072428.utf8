The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Love is a rose, lust its fragrance
                                                                                                               Love is a rose, lust its fragrance
                              Poet Kamala Das Suraiyya                             
	Call from Kochi, said my colleague. Am I speaking to the editor of The Little Magazine? The voice was polite but firm. This businesslike question is usually followed by bitter complaints by writing enthusiasts or subscribers missing a copy.         
	Yes, I sighed.         
	Thank you, she said gently. I cant tell you how much joy you have given me. I am old, I live alone in Cochin. I was losing interest in life. Then somebody sent me some issues of your magazine. I dont see very well, and your typeface is small. But now I sit in my garden every day, in the bright sunlight, and read your magazine. It has made me interested in life again. Thank you.         
	So glad, I mumbled like an idiot. The conversation continued, she remarkably articulate, liberal with her appreciation and I making occasional daft noises through the lump in my throat. Whats your name? she asked. I told her. Beautiful name. I am Kamala Das.        
	From that moment in 2001, I was blessed with the very generous affection of Kamala Das Suraiyya, and her trust, as she shared her poems even from her sickbed, from halfway across the country. Poems about love and death. Startlingly honest, beautiful poems about old age, sickness, betrayal and love. There was always love.         
	Very few can love with such passion and brutal honesty. For her, divine love (Krishna, I am melting,/ Melting, melting/ Nothing remains/ But you.) was as authentic as adulterous love (Through peep-holes, the neighbours watch,/ they watch me come/ And go like rain.) or domestic love (Gift him what makes you woman, the scent of/ Long hair, the musk of sweat between the breasts,/ The warm shock of menstrual blood, and all your/ Endless female hungers.) Did she write about lust too much? I write about love, she said. If love is a rose, lust is its fragrance.        
	Her writing was marked by both an in-your-face sexuality and a deep Hindu devotion. So it was shocking when she converted to Islam at 65 and started writing poems for Ya Allah as His slavish handmaiden. Kamala Suraiyya said she liked the orthodoxy of Islam: Freedom had become a burden for me. Had she converted for the love of a Muslim man? Kamala never denied being in love at any age.         
	Her recent poems explored betrayal, by the body and the lover. You humbled me with coarse words, made/ me feel old and inadequate./ I cannot buy youth at any/ pharmacists. But she could dump the lover. I shall not have a heavy hand on my bosom/ a greying head against my knee.         
	Controversies followed her to the grave. After the passionate farewell by countless grieving admirers and the state funeral with gun salute, Hindu fundamentalists protested that she should have been cremated, not buried. This brought to a fitting end the story of Kamala Das, alias Madhavikutty, alias Kamala Suraiyya  the legend behind My Story, her autobiography at 42.        
	Be Amy, or be Kamala. Or, better/ Still, be Madhavikutty. It is time to/ Choose a name, a role. She never did choose. She lived many lives in one. With a healthy disdain for categorisers she strode through life, exploring love, womanhood, poetry, art, sensuality, beauty, language and devotion in myriad ways. She even stood for elections. Dress in sarees, be girl/ Be wife, they said. Be embroiderer, be cook,/ Be a quarreller with servants. Fit in. Oh,/ Belong        
	She didnt fit in, but she belonged. She made a space for herself in the hearts of millions as Madhavikutty the author in Malayalam and Kamala Das the poet in English. I speak three languages, write in/ Two, dream in one. Her sensitivity, her talent for expressing complex sentiments simply, and her unsettling, bewildering honesty made her not just a literary icon (she was nominated for the Nobel) but a much-loved, much-hated, much-worshipped woman. She crashed through walls of convention, blazing a freedom trail that Indian women writers still fear to tread.         
	We talked on the phone, she insisting that I have a holiday at her Kochi home, just lazing about, chatting, reading, eating home-cooked Kerala food. It never happened. I saw her last in 2006 in Delhi, as she accepted The Little Magazine SALAM (South Asian Literary Award for the Masters) for fiction. She sat regally in her wheelchair in her silky pink burkha or elegant black hijab with a dashing headgear, twirling a rose like an empress. The beautiful long-haired Kamala in a sari and bindi with amazing kohl-rimmed eyes had turned into a stunning sultana.         
	After a dreadful spate of ill health in 2007, Kamala gave in to her youngest son Jayasurya, and moved to Pune to live with him. Now, her poems explored other desires of the flesh  the desire to walk on legs free of oedema, to celebrate a day without pain. But she wouldnt let mortality get the upper hand  that belonged to poetry. The last breath/ exhaled/ is the last poem/ released. We published her last poems in The Little Magazine in April.         
	Today, Kamala Das is once again what the feisty young woman chose to be. I am sinner,/ I am saint. I am the beloved and the/ Betrayed. Cult writer, warm friend, freethinker, indestructible woman.

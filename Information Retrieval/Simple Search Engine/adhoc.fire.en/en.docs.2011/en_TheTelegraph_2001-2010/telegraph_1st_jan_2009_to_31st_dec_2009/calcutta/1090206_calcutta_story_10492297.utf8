                Branches more than eight inches in diameter of about 20 trees on Ballygunge Circular Road were chopped off on Wednesday. According to Rohan Chakravarty, an NGO member, those who were felling the branches said they had permission from the civic body. Cutting trees and trimming branches more than 4 inches in diameter are prohibited without the forest departments consent. I am looking into why branches of more than the prescribed thickness were trimmed, said mayoral council member (parks and gardens) Faiyaz Ahmed Khan.

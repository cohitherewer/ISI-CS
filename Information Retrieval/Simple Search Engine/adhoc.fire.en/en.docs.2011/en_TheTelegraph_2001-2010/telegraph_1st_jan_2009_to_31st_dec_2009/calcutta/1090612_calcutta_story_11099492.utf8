The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fume fight: nine years and nothing to show
                                                                                                               Fume fight: nine years and nothing to show
										            
	June 2000: Jyoti Basu was the chief minister of Bengal and the cricket hero he shares his birthday with had taken over as Team India captain when a 10-member, high court-appointed committee came up with a set of recommendations to rid the city of automobile pollution.        
	June 2009: Nothing has changed except that both Basu and Sourav Ganguly have (all but) retired to the pavilion. The recommendations remain on paper, and old and polluting automobiles continue to poison the air we breathe. As the government prepares to seek yet another extension of the clean-air deadline from the high court, Metro revisits the recommendations to compile a non-action taken report:                  
	RECOMMENDATION: The government should draft an action plan to make all three-wheelers switch to LPG   
	STATUS: The city has 13 LPG outlets but these remain under-utilised. Autorickshaw operators mostly use katatel (adulterated fuel), one of the main causes of pollution, and the government treats them with kid gloves. Barely 4,000 autos have switched to LPG, and that includes those who fell in line after the high court order in 2008.  
	RECOMMENDATION: Transport department should take steps to rid the city of the large number of three-wheelers without valid registration   
	STATUS: Illegal autos  around 40,000 of them ply in greater Calcutta  are rarely impounded by police because the operators enjoy political patronage. When the cops seized a few of them in January, the auto unions flexed their muscles and brought the city to a standstill            
	RECOMMENDATION: Transport department should draw up a strategy within three months to control emission from state-owned buses and other government vehicles; status of implementation should be shared with public at frequent intervals   
	STATUS: No such plan was drafted, though the government has of late been adding new buses  
	RECOMMENDATION: Transport department to improve functioning of auto-emission testing centres   
	STATUS: A computerised auto-emission testing system was introduced in 2005, but corruption has negated its benefits. Vehicles, mainly the commercial ones, are known to bribe officials to bypass the test.            
	RECOMMENDATION: Pollution-under-control certificates should be renewed every three months and no fuel should be sold to an automobile without a valid certificate   
	STATUS: More than 80 per cent of the vehicles on city roads do not have valid certificates. As for the no-PUC-no-fuel rule, the environment department did issue a directive but withdrew it under pressure from the transport lobby, including government officials   
	RECOMMENDATION: The commercial lifespan of vehicles, including taxis and autos, should be reduced to a maximum of eight years by July 2005 unless they switch to cleaner technology or green fuel. Registration of new three-wheelers should be suspended             
	STATUS: The transport department gives the impression that it wants to implement the proposal, but hasnt made any attempt to do so. The high court converted the environment departments 2008 notification on phasing out two-stroke autos into an order, but the government and the unions continue to stonewall the move. Registration of autos continues unabated  
	RECOMMENDATION: No private non-commercial vehicle, including two-wheelers, manufactured prior to 1975 should be allowed to ply in greater Calcutta from January 2002   
	STATUS: No action taken

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Vandalism in bank
                                                                                                               Vandalism in bank
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	About 50 members of the Bengal Taxi Association vandalised the Lansdowne branch of the United Bank of India on Wednesday to protest the delay in sanctioning loans for new cabs.        
	The taxi drivers, whose vehicles cannot ply in the city after the high court ban on old vehicles comes into effect, barged into the bank around 12.15pm and shouted slogans outside the branch managers chamber for 15 minutes. They broke windowpanes and flowerpots before leaving.        
	A bank official said it had been agreed that loans would be disbursed after the regional transport authority forwards a list of taxi drivers to them. The bank was yet to receive the list. The association general secretary said those who vandalised the bank had been censured.

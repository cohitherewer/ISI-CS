          A STAFF REPORTER                           The Kali idol of Tarun Mahal Club in Dhakuria                                  
	More than 10,000 policemen will be on the road on Saturday to ensure peaceful Kali puja and Diwali celebrations, Lalbazar has announced.         
	The elaborate security arrangements have been prompted by the home ministry alert for metros in view of terror attacks in Pakistan.        
	Quick Reaction Teams, Special Action Force and Rapid Action Force will be on stand-by and cops will maintain a vigil from 14 watchtowers across the city. Special arrangements have been made for 17 big Kali puja pandals and temples in north and south Calcutta.         
	The temples include Kalighat, Lake Kalibari, Firingi Kalibari and Thanthania Kalibari.        
	The arrangements for this year are unprecedented and will be in place till early on Sunday, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner (headquarters).        
	Representatives of temple committees have been briefed about the measures. It has been decided that the footage recorded by closed-circuit cameras at the 17 pandals and temples will be stored and analysed to evaluate the security measures, said a senior officer.        
	To ensure that banned crackers are not burst two constables each will be deployed in the highrise buildings where the maximum number of violations were reported last year, said a senior officer at Lalbazar.        
	Officers-in-charge of the 48 police stations in the city have been asked to identify buildings in their area where violations might take place, added the officer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Report adds to suicide angle
                                                                                                               Report adds to suicide angle
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Arindam Manna                                  
	The first post-mortem on Arindam Mannas body has bolstered the suicide theory.        
	The report of the post-mortem at Serampore Walsh Hospital stated that the Dum Dum GRP sub-inspector was alive when he sustained his injuries.        
	The first post-mortem report stated the injuries were ante mortem in nature. This means, he sustained the injuries before dying. This does not, however, prove conclusively that he had committed suicide, said a senior CID officer.         
	Investigators have so far found that on February 10, Manna had travelled from Dasnagar to Howrah and after spending some time there, went to Bandel. Around 11.35pm he called home from Howrah station, said an officer. When he made the last call at 1.40am, he was in Bandel.        
	The last local train leaves Howrah at 11.40pm. Manna may have taken it to Bandel. It is unlikely that he reached Mankundu by a night train since no Howrah-bound train stops at the station. In all probability, he took the first local train on February 11 morning and got off at Mankundu, added the officer.         
	On Monday, the investigators spoke to Sheoraphuli GRP officer-in-charge Somnath Mukherjee for an hour at Bhawani Bhavan and declared that there were no major lapses on his part before sending the body for post-mortem.        
	The railway police top brass have maintained that Mukherjee had erred by not taking pictures of the body before sending it for post-mortem.        
	Late on Monday, Dum Dum GRP officer-in-charge Manab Chakrabarty, with whom Manna allegedly had a tiff and who was named in the FIR by the sub-inspectors family, was transferred. The authorities called it a routine transfer.        
	Home secretary Ardhendu Sen said the state was satisfied with the progress of the probe.

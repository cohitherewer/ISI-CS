          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Five youths on two motorcycles looted a postal department van carrying over Rs 24 lakh by throwing chilli powder on the eyes of the occupants at Gandhimore in Titagarh on Tuesday afternoon.        
	The five blocked the path of the red Maruti Omni, which distributes cash to post offices and sub-post offices in North 24-Parganas, before three of them attacked the two constables and a postal employee in the car and its driver with chilli powder, said witnesses.         
	The trio then pulled the four out of the vehicle and drove away, followed by the other two on bikes. Two of the men in the car emptied the vault before the three abandoned the vehicle at Surya Sen Colony in Lakshmighat, 500m from Gandhighat, and sped away on the motorcycles, said a resident, who was at a teashop.        
	The four inside the car were admitted to Balaram Bose State General Hospital with eye injuries. We will interrogate them when they are fit to talk, said Supratim Sarkar, the superintendent of North 24-Parganas police.The postal department could not ascertain the amount looted.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Canvas prism for Raj relics
          ARKA DAS                                    Mark Jones, the director of Londons Victoria and Albert Museum, inaugurates the exhibition at Victoria Memorial and visitors enjoy the paintings. (Aranya Sen)				                                 
	A view of Old Fort at Calcutta, with the recently-built Writers Buildings, Holwell Monument and Playhouse Theatre along Clive Street in a pen-and-ink and watercolour by Thomas Danielle in 1775.         
	An exact reproduction of the suspension bridge at Alipore over Tollys Nullah, in an 1848 aquatint by Charles DOyly. A riverside panorama from the newly built Fort William by William Orme in the latter half of the 19th century.         
	Not just glimpses of the city as it looked back in the day: the Taj Mahal, the royal palace in Madurai, the Jama Masjid in Delhi, top-of-the-world views from Khandala and magnificent Ellora cave sculpture come alive in an exhibition titled Indian Life and Landscape by Western Artists. It showcases works by primarily British landscape masters from the collection of the Victoria amp; Albert Museum (V amp;A) in London.         
	The display is on at a rather fitting venue  the Portrait Gallery at Victoria Memorial  till January 31, 2010.         
	Organised by the British Council and Victoria Memorial and supported by the World Collections Programme of the UK government, the exhibition saw its grand opening on Saturday evening, with Mark Jones, the director of V amp;A; Jawhar Sircar, the secretary to the ministry of culture, and Bina Ellias Sarkar, the editor-publisher of Gallerie International as guests.         
	Other events include workshops on watercolour, souvenir design and panel discussions from January 2, and a quiz on Indian history conducted by Barry O Brien.        
	The works, in keeping with their context, are being displayed at heritage sites: the exhibition moves to Hyderabads Salarjung Museum next.         
	Given the tradition of the Madras, Bombay, Calcutta and Lahore schools of art that developed during the Raj, this is a significant exhibition. Most of the paintings are representative, be it in terms of studying nature, monuments or people, and lean towards documentation.         
	Jones, on his maiden visit to the city, pointed out that a number of the artists on display, including George Chinnery, Samuel Howitt and John Sell Cottman never visited India. Their works on India were based on writings, journals and sketches and paintings by other artists.         
	The individual always carries a personal prism and the view through that does come across, he explained. More collaborative efforts are in the offing: given the V amp;As substantial collection of Kalighat pata paintings, Jones expressed his interest in organising an exhibition of Indian works spanning the period of the present display.         
	Divided into four sections, Indian Life and Landscape by Western Artists offers interesting anecdotes on each work, making it easier to connect the artist and his subject. The particularly large collection of realist works by the uncle and nephew duo of Thomas and William Daniell  the 1775 Old Fort view of the city by Thomas, the senior, was one of the first paintings of an European artist in India  is impressive.         
	There are works from the Flemish artist Francis Balthazar Solvyns series of 35 studies (1792-96) of various Indian assistants in European households, intriguing in their point of view of looking at the Hindoo.         
	An interesting inclusion is Charles DOylys caricatures of Tom Raw the Griffin, based on the protagonist of his burlesque poems. From the later Romantic period, William Carpenter and William Simpsons topographically fascinating landscapes and monument paintings (Pir Panjal Pass Into Cashmir by Simpson, 1863; Gateway of The Buland Darwaza at the Jama Masjid and Ancient Observatory at Delhi by the same) are awe-inspiring works of detail.         
	The exhibition is open 10am to 5pm except Mondays.

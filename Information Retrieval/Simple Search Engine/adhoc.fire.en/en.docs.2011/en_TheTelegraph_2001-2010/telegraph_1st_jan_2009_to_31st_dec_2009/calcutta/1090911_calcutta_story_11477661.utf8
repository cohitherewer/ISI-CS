The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Multiplicity on plex menu   Quantity key to film buffet
                                                                                                               Multiplicity on plex menu   Quantity key to film buffet
  - 17 films but little to watch in weekend of small releases          PRATIM D. GUPTA                            WILL YOU WASTE TIME ON EITHER? Baabarr and Vaada Raha that release on Friday                                             
	Seventeen movies and not much on. The predicament of the city plex-goer this weekend is like a flashback to Bruce Spingsteens 1992 classic on the state of the small screen, 57 Channels And Nothin On.        
	With big Bollywood going into Ramazan hibernation, multiplexes are living up to their name and flooding the screens with multiple movies. But chances are there will still be few takers for the widest movie buffet in town since plexes arrived six years ago.        
	The six screens of Fame (South City) will be playing 17 films  a city record  of which 10 are new releases. A mix of small Bollywood  Baabarr, Aamras, Vaada Raha  and offbeat Hollywood  9, District 9  the Friday newbies dont have the big stars to get the audiences in.        
	INOX (Forum) has 14 films playing every day while INOX (City Centre) has 13. But none with the clout to command more than four shows a day.                                
	We have around 12 films playing at each of our Mumbai properties so the Calcutta number is the highest for us, Sonali Shroff, the head of corporate communications of Fame Cinemas, told Metro.        
	This is a result of the Ramazan period plus a huge backlog of movies because of the nine-week producer-plex strike. The makers are getting their small films out of the way before the big movies arrive, he added.        
	Kaminey and Life Partner, that hit theatres on August 14, were the last big Bollywood releases. Since then only small Hindi movies have found their way to the cinema halls.        
	These films have done below average business and most of them have not lasted more than a week, says Captain Virendra Marya, the regional director (east) of INOX.        
	According to trade analysts, the multiplexes are trying to make the best of a bad situation by offering cine-goers a wide spread of films.        
	You cant play more than two to three daily shows of these small films and so you have the option of actually playing a lot of movies, says Taran Adarsh. You can only hope that one of them would pick up with word of mouth.        
	That hasnt happened, yet. Only the Hollywood films have brought in some audiences, especially for the night shows. The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 and The Final Destination have done much better their Bolly counterparts and Rituparno Ghoshs Shob Charitro Kalponik has also been a decent draw.        
	The biggest star on this Fridays Bolly-Tolly menu is Prosenjit in Houseful, with Bobby Deol for company in Vaada Raha and Mithun Chakraborty in Baabarr.        
	The drought turns into flood from next Friday with Dil Bole Hadippa starring Shahid Kapur and Rani Mukerji and Salman Khans action flick Wanted setting the tone for Priyanka Chopras Whats Your Raashee and Ranbir Kapoors Wake Up Sid before the Diwali blast of Akshay Kumars Blue, Ajay Devgan-Bipasha Basus All the Best and Salman-Kareena Kapoors Main Aurr Mrs Khanna.

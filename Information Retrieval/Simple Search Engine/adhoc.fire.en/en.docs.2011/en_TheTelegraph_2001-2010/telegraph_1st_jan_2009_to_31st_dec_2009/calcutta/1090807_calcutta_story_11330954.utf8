                      Memories and melodies                    Perhaps the most popular and influential music composer of the Hindi film industry, R.D. Burman was famous for his peppy tunes and rhythms. He teamed up with leading playback singers like Asha Bhosle, Kishore Kumar, Lata Mangeshkar and others to churn out some of the biggest hits in Bollywood music history. Credited with revolutionising Hindi film music, his style and techniques continue to be followed by composers even today. Pancham Beats, this evenings concert, will focus on rhythm, which was definitely one of the most dominant aspects of his music. There will be performances by R.D.s ace drummer Franko Vaz, percussionists Amrutrao Katkar, Vijay Katkar, Manohari Singh, Bhanu Gupta and Ramesh Iyer. They will share unknown anecdotes about the legend along with narration of stories that served as inspirations behind the composition of some evergreen melodies. They will also demonstrate on various percussion instruments that Pancham (as R.D. was popularly known) used in his creations with the use of acoustics on stage. While Franko Vaz will play original songs like Aaa dekhen zara, O Maria, Dil lena khel hai dildar ka, Zamaane ko dikhana hai, Pyar nagma hai, Chand koi hoga and others, R.D.s leading arranger Manohari Singh will mesmerise the audience with a flute and saxophone performance. Hosted by Euphony.                  Event: An evening of music in memory of R.D. Burman When: Today at 6 pm Where: Kala Mandir

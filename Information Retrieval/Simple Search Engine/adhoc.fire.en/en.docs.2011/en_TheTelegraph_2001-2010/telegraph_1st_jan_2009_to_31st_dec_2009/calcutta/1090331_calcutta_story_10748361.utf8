The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Drink driving claims baby in the womb
                                                                                                               Drink driving claims baby in the womb
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The WagonR that hit Shampa on Sunday                                  
	Pregnant homemaker Shampa Chakraborty, hit by a car whose driver was drinking at the wheel, lost her unborn child in the accident.         
	The sonogram has confirmed that the foetus, just over four months old, has died. Shampa herself has multiple injuries and is in trauma, a doctor at the Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratishthan said on Monday.         
	Shampa, 26, was standing on the pavement in front of her home on Raja Basanta Roy Road on Sunday afternoon when Vinay Singhs silver-coloured WagonR came straight at her after ramming into a lamp post.        
	Vinay, a real estate broker, had a beer bottle in his left hand when he was driving, witnesses told police.        
	Shampas husband Amit, who works in an event management firm, was shattered on being told that their first baby had died.        
	I want all four persons in that car to get exemplary punishment. I am praying for Shampa but I dont know how she will react to this tragedy, he cried.        
	A medical test confirmed that Vinay and his friend Ajit Gupta  the two other men in the car had fled  had high levels of alcohol in their bloodstream when the accident occurred. The arrested duo have been remanded in police custody till April 2.        
	Uma Shankar Ojha, the officer-in-charge of Tollygunge police station, said Golf Green resident Vinay had been charged under sections 279 (rash driving), 308 (attempt to culpable homicide) and 315 (act to prevent child from being born) of the IPC.        
	A relative said Shampa, who has to undergo a medical procedure to extract the foetus, had been questioning her doctors about the baby since regaining consciousness.        
	She suspects something is amiss. When her blood pressure, pulse rate and other vital signs stabilise, someone close to her will have to break the news to her, a doctor said.        
	Shampa has fractures in the shaft of her left femur and pelvis and she requires immediate orthopaedic surgery.         
	She is probably suffering from fat embolism, a condition where the fat comes out through the fractured femur and travels up the blood vessels, blocking the coronary or cerebral arteries. She is still not out of danger, the doctor warned.        
	The police have launched a manhunt for Harjinder Singh and Pappu Walia, who were in the backseat of the WagonR when the accident occurred.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Freedom to be different
                                                                                                                   Freedom to be different

	Images speak better than words. This was evident at the staging of This Room Is Not My Room, a play by Open Space at the office of Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee, a sex workers welfare organisation, in Sonagachhi on Thursday. Open Space is a public awareness programme started by the Pune-based Centre for Communication and Development Studies.         
	People are prejudiced against the children of sex workers. They eye us with suspicion and hatred. We are ostracised when we apply for admission to schools or colleges, said Govindo Saha, a first-year student of sociology at Mahindra Chandra College.         
	I dropped out of school in Class VII, unable to bear the ridicule and abuse of my peers for being the daughter of a sex worker, said 16-year-old Tanjila Khatun.         
	The youngsters, along with other sex workers children, were interacting with the actors in the 30-minute play, a part of the Positive Spaces Campaign, launched in January. The play emerged out of a three-day workshop conducted by theatre activist Parnab Mukherjee, with NGO Thoughtshop Foundation.        
	The actors were asked to think of what they feared most. While some spoke of bomb blasts, others counted domestic violence and the loss of trust as their worst nightmares, said Debolina Dutta, a human rights lawyer and a fellow of the centre. It shows that you might discover that the space you consider your own might not be so, she added.         
	Without a linear plot, it was a collection of short segments, narrated and enacted by 20 volunteers.        
	MA student Anjana Pals segment on violence against women depicted rape while another on terrorism showed a bomb blast victim finding his home destroyed.         
	Modelled on a programme in Canada, Open Space mobilises college students in a six-month programme, comprising workshops on human rights, with activities like poster-making, photography and protest theatre.         
	It stresses on the freedom to be different. This includes practising the profession of ones choice, even if it is a social taboo, said Dutta.         
	The campaign made us sensitive to those who are different from us, whether homosexuals or sex workers, said Inam Mahfuz, a first year student of Shri Shikshayatan College who acted in the play.         
	Like most people, I grew up considering prostitution a stigma. Now I find it easier to accept people joining it as a profession, said Anjana.         
	We will stage the play again in May. The kids want to be a part of it too, said Dutta.

	CHIT CHAT  
	Skills, career tips  
	On April 2, Aditya Academy Senior Secondary School, Barasat, organised a seminar on career guidance for senior students.         
	The seminar was attended by professionals from fields as diverse as chartered accountancy, law, media and pharmaceuticals. The panelists included Mrityunjoy Seal, a fellow of the Indian Institute of Company Secretaries, M.K. Datta, a fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, Narendra Deo Dubey, a senior advocate of Calcutta High Court, Siddhartha Roy (Sidhu), lead vocalist of the band Cactus, Ujjal Banerjee of Ramakrishna Mission College, Narendrapur and Prabhat Pandey of ICFAI School of Business.        
	The programme, attended by over 300 students, began with performances by the school band followed by the girls choir. The high point was Sidhus rendition of the Cactus classic Holud Pakhi.         
	Maity stressed that the value of skilled people is the highest in the 21st century, but warned students not to become machines in their search for material comforts.         
	You have to strike a balance between professional commitments and being a good human being. The art is to keep an open mind and work towards a goal, he said.         
	Students were all ears for Sidhus account of his young days, where he spoke of choosing his band over practising medicine. It is best to choose a career you enjoy, he said.         
	While Mrityunjoy Seal, a fellow of the Indian Institute of Company Secretaries, gave a short presentation on company secretaryship as a profession, Dubey discussed the prospects of a career in law.         
	Banerjee, having served for 24 years in a multinational pharmaceutical giant, spoke on healthcare, research and the pharmaceutical industry.

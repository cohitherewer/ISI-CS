          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 19-year-old boy who slipped into the Hooghly during Saraswati puja immersions was saved by two policemen of the Disaster Management Group (DMG) on Sunday afternoon.        
	Gautam Chatterjee, a resident of Tollygunge, slipped and fell into the river at Gwalior ghat while helping his friends immerse an idol. He did not know how to swim and started to drown.        
	The DMG men, Kishore Roy and Rezaul Mandal, who were deployed at the ghat to avert accidents during immersion, immediately jumped in after the teenager.        
	The current had swept the youth about 20 feet away. The two policemen pulled him back to bank and pumped water out of his stomach, said an officer of South Port police station.        
	Gautam did not need to be hospitalised because the DMG staffs took him out quickly, said Pradip Chatterjee, the deputy commissioner (headquarters).

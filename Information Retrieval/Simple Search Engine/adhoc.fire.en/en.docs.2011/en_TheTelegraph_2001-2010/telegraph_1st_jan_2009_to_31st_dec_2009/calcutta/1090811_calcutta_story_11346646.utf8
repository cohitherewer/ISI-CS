	Song, dance and food, too        
	The first edition of Jaco Sanskriti, the bilingual inter-school fest of St James School, held from July 23 to 25, saw seven reputable city schools battling it out in events that tested their music, dance, oratory and even culinary skills.         
	The fest opened with Jaco Jagriti, a competitive cultural event for NGOs. Don Bosco Night School bested NGOs like Cini Asha and Future Hope with their moves to the tune of A. R. Rahmans Jai ho!         
	In Jaco Parivartan, the participants recycled waste to make useful items, like the slippers made by Calcutta Girls High School. The show stealers for the day were Jaco Gurukul, where teachers competed in a cultural performance and Jacouture, a fashion show with the royal dynasties of India as the theme.         
	The main attraction on Day II was Jaco Rasoi, where students stirred up mouth-watering delicacies with astonishing ease. Three participants from each school had an hour and a half to prepare a starter, a main course and a dessert on a theme. The boys were as good as the girls. Our theme was Mughlai food. We made paneer sashlik, jeera rice, navratan korma and shahi paneer, with shahi tukda for dessert, smiled Karan Chawla of St James, which came first.        
	Jaco Shikaar, a scavenger hunt, found participants scurrying across campus to locate specific places in the school, of which they had to take pictures. Jaco Sabha took on the controversial subject of Section 377, the section of the Indian Penal Code that declares voluntary carnal intercourse against the order of nature punishable.         
	Day III, the founders day of the school, began with Jaco Abhineta, where participants mimicked well-known personalities, including Mamata Banerjee, Sonia Gandhi, Mayawati and Darsheel Safary. The overall winner was St James School, followed by Modern High School and Welland Gouldsmith.

	Rabindra Utsav, a celebration of Tagores works with theatre, dance and music performances by groups from across the country, has been a part of the citys cultural calendar for the last three years. This year, the programme included school students with a week-long childrens theatre festival.         
	From July 19 to 25, Chhelebela Rabindra Natyatsav saw 10 schools contesting at the Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre (EZCC) to find a place in the Utsav, held from August 1 to 10.         
	We want the childrens festival to be a regular event so that Tagores works are celebrated by the young, who will be encouraged to find innovative ways of interpreting the bards genius, said Vijay Iyengar, a member of Happenings, which organised the festival.        
	The Future Foundation Schools presentation explored the various ways the mother figure is depicted in Tagores work. Titled The Mother, it was replete with Rabindrasangeet, dance and excerpts from Tagores writings. The childrens skill and confidence won the day, even though the performance lacked a plot.         
	Garden High School presented Amritsya Putra, a tapestry of Tagores philosophic writings, while Modern High School staged Brikkho Ropan Utsav, with a message on global warming.         
	E Jomi Laibo Kine, the play by Birla High School (Boys) was judged the most creative. The play highlighted the bond between a farmer and his land, often torn apart by the greed and whims of the rich.         
	Birla Junior Schools Birpurush and Kathak Performing Repertorys Juto Abiskar were invited to stage their work out of competition on the first and final days of the main festival.         
	Birpurush was an enactment of a childs imaginary adventure with his mother through a world of danger. The tiny dacoits with glued-on moustaches won many hearts.         
	The judges, Samik Bandyopadhyay, Sunil Banerji, Jayati Bose and Dolly Basu, however, felt that most of the interpretations could not be called plays. Linking together bits of songs, prose and dance is not enough, said theatre and film scholar Bandyopadhyay.         
	E Jomi was selected for the concluding day of the Utsav at Gyan Manch, along with the performances of Garden High and Modern High schools.

	The tournament, in its fifth year, started with the captains meet on July 23, at Frank Anthony School, inaugurated by footballer P.K. Banerjee.

	The tournament, which till last year was confined to Calcutta, has become an all Bengal event this year.         
	The tournament is being held in two phases for the junior (classes IV to VI) and senior (classes VII to XII) levels.         
	At each location, eight teams each from the junior and senior sections vied to reach the quarter-finals, held on the first day. The second day hosts the semi-finals and finals.         
	About 80 city schools (64 in the senior level and 16 in the junior level) are participating in the Calcutta league, being held from August 3 to 16.         
	The tournament includes teams from Don Bosco Park Circus, Assembly of God Church, St James School, Birla High School for Boys, La Martiniere for Boys and South Point High School.         
	Each of the district champions at the senior level will play the Bengal mega finals, to be held on August 21 and 22 in the city at Vivekananda Park.

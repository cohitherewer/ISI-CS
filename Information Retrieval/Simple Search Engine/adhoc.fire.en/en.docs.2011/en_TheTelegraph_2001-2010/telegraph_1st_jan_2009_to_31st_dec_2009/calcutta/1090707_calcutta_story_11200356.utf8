The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Upgrade for Mamata projects
                                                                                                               Upgrade for Mamata projects
          SANJAY MANDAL                  
	The two railway hospitals in the city that Mamata Banerjee has identified for turning into medical colleges are upgrading their facilities before applying for the Medical Council of Indias clearance.        
	The railway minister in her budget speech on Friday had proposed that Eastern Railways BR Singh Hospital in Sealdah and South Eastern Railways hospital in Garden Reach be converted to medical colleges through public-private partnership.        
	The minister also wants to set up two more medical colleges in the state, in Barasat (North 24-Parganas) and Kharagpur (West Midnapore). Students qualifying the Joint Entrance Examination will be admitted in these colleges.         
	Private hospitals interested in setting up medical colleges will be invited through tenders to execute the projects in the state. They can use the facilities of the two city hospitals to set up medical teaching institutions, a senior official of the railway ministry told Metro over phone from Delhi.        
	A guideline on upgrading the infrastructure will be sent to both hospitals soon. On the basis of that, the hospitals will prepare a detailed project report (DPR) and start work within two months.        
	According to the MCI guidelines, a medical college must have a hospital with at least 300 beds and the campus must spread across 25 acres.        
	The Garden Reach hospital runs postgraduate courses in surgery, general medicine and gynaecology while the one in Sealdah runs DNB courses in medicine, surgery, gynaecology, ophthalmology and anaesthesiology.        
	To function as medical colleges, both hospitals have to create facilities such as laboratories for physiology, biology, pathology and other subjects, dissection halls for anatomy and special morgues, said a railway official.        
	BR Singh Hospital has 461 beds and another 75 will be added soon. The administrative building will be demolished and a six-storeyed structure will come up in its place, an official of Eastern Railways Sealdah division said on Sunday.        
	The Garden Reach hospital has 330 beds. The hospital runs three-year postgraduate courses. We will upgrade some facilities to introduce MBBS courses. Additional land, if required, is available in adjoining areas, said Saumitra Majumdar, the chief public relations officer of South Eastern Railway.        
	State health department officials said it would take at least three to four years for the medical colleges to come up if work is taken up on a war footing.        
	The hospitals need to set up departments with outdoor and indoor treatment facilities, recruit professors and other teaching doctors before applying for the medical councils approval. All such work takes a lot of time, said a Swastha Bhavan official.         
	BR Singh Hospital, which has good infrastructure, may have to procure land to meet the medical councils condition, he added.

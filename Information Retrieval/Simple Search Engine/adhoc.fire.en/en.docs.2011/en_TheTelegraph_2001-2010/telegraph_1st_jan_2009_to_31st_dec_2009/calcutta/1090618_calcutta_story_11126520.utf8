The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Girl found hanging in bathroom
                                                                                                               Girl found hanging in bathroom
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 12-year-old girl was found hanging in the bathroom of her KC 50 home in Salt Lake on Wednesday morning.        
	Preliminary investigations suggested Akanksha Basu, a Class VII student of A.I.W.C. Buniyadi Vidyapith Girls High School in Beleghata, had committed suicide, police said.         
	Cops are, however, unsure what exactly triggered the act. An officer said Akanksha had wanted to go to school on Wednesday and had apparently felt slighted when her father Swajan, a state government employee, had asked her to stay home because of the heat.         
	The parents had taken the body to hospital. We saw the body only after it was brought back home. We have sent the body for post-mortem but preliminarily, there were signs of partial hanging, said an officer of Bidhannagar (South) police station.        
	Cops are also probing if the girl was trying to enact a stunt she had seen on TV.        
	The parents said Akanksha went to the bathroom around 9.30am. When she didnt come out even after 45 minutes, they peeped through a window and saw her hanging from a rope tied between the shower and the window grille. She had used her night dress to hang herself from the rope, said an officer.        
	The parents broke open the door and found her unconscious. Her feet were touching the ground.        
	They rushed her to AMRI Hospital, where she was declared dead, said a relative. The couple also have a six-year-old daughter.

	Cyclone Aila is not the end. As the sea level rises, Calcutta has to brave a greater exodus of climate refugees from the Sunderbans              
	Four days after Aila struck, Bishnupada Mandal and his wife packed their belongings  wet clothes, a few pots and pans, some wet rice and his damaged harmonium  and left.        
	Just as certain as Bishnupada the kabiyal, or singer, was about lugging the harmonium along, so he was about where he was heading with his wife Krishna and four-year-old son. Climate refugees from the Sunderbans make Sonarpur, an arms length away from Calcutta, their first port of call.        
	After their home at Luxbagan on Satjelia island was washed away by the river Raimongol, 38-year-old Bishnupada and his family took a mechanised boat, transferring to an autorickshaw to get to Canning station for the train to Sonarpur, popularly known as Little Gosaba, named after a Sunderbans area that was hammered by Cyclone Aila.                  Kabiyal Bishnupada Mandals four-year-old son in Sonarpur. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha      
	I waited for a few days hoping that the government and our elected representatives would hold our hand and help us get up on our feet again. But no help came, not even basic relief material. When my son even stopped crying for food because he had no energy left, I joined the thousands fleeing the Sunderbans, Bishnupada said, watching his son play with the harmonium.        
	Vivekananda Pally was their destination where they knew they could find shelter in the home of Krishnas sister, who works as an attendant at SSKM Hospital.        
	Climate refugees, made famous in the report by the UNs Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that won the Nobel Prize under the leadership of the Indian R.K. Pachauri, are no more stuck between the lines of doomsday predictions. Theyre here, knocking on Calcuttas doors.        
	Theyve been heading this way for a couple of decades at least but in threes and fours. The maid is from Basanti, thats all we knew. Wheres Basanti? Only now we realise its in the Sunderbans. Aila has swept away lives in one place and opened some eyes in another.        
	Basanti in city         
	Basanti has been amongst us, though, in many ways. We didnt know. Tushar Kanjilal, an expert on the Sunderbans, revealed that a locality close to Kalindi, in the north of Calcutta, was called Basanti, named so by people whod come from there.        
	Islands of climate refugees have sprung up in and around Calcutta.         
	Sudhangsu Sekhar Sarkar, once the headmaster of Rajat Jubilee High School in Satjelia who has also received The Telegraph award for contribution to education, settled in Sonarpur after retirement.         
	Its like a virtual Sunderbans here when I went to the market the other day. I met so many known faces from Gosaba, Basanti, Hingalgunge and Sandeshkhali. Many of them left after Aila struck, he said.        
	Over a hundred kilometres away, on Chhotomollakhali island of Gosaba, Gopal Mandal shouts, spotting a neighbour taking a crowded mechanised boat with his family and livestock for the mainland, Kothay jachcho kaka, ar phirbena? (Where are you going uncle, wont you come back)?         
	Dekhi, ma roilo, ektu dekhis (Lets see, mother has stayed back, please keep an eye on her), shouted back the person jostling to get a foothold in the boat.        
	Mandal, a primary school teacher, said: At least 200 people are going to the mainland every day, many permanently with family and even livestock, leaving some elderly persons on the island in the hope of not missing government help when it comes.        
	Many dont have an answer to the question if they will ever return. One of them is Gobinda Mandal, who had never thought of leaving home at Satjelia despite losing his father and one other family member to tigers.         
	I have nothing here, still we (a family of five) had to run as it was impossible to live there after Aila; the land is full of saline water with embankments completely devastated and houses damaged. Im trying to get some students to give tuition to. Dont know what is in store, he said.         
	World issue        
	Will he go back? We will be here till the monsoon, maybe Puja. All depends on how the situation unfolds and if embankments are repaired.        
	The Pachauri report had warned that soaring temperatures and rising sea levels would make many areas, particularly those closer to coast, uninhabitable and people would become climate refugees and move inland. The Sunderbans in India and Bangladesh were named as extremely vulnerable to climate changes.        
	A Jadavpur University research predicted in 2003 that there would be largescale inward migration from the Sunderbans. We found that with the sea level rising, and frequency of cyclones increasing  and more often than not they work in tandem  there would be more vicious tidal surges and destruction and by 2020 about 70,000 would become climate refugees and overall 23 lakh would be affected. Many of them would go towards Calcutta, said Sugato Hazra of oceanographic studies at the university.        
	City stress        
	In 2009, and after Aila, the figures seem to have been understated. Climate models forecast that as the world warms; the rains will be concentrated in a shorter period, throwing up a devastating combination of severe floods and longer periods of drought. They also forecast that if the sea level rises by up to a metre this century (which is predicted), as many as 30 million Bangladeshis could become climate refugees. Then it will not be climate refugees from Gosaba alone Calcutta will shelter.        
	Kanjilal explained that the trickle out of the Sunderbans started after a destructive cyclone in 1988, which lit the fear of insecurity in the minds of the islands people.         
	Tapas Ghatak, an urban development expert, said: The migration trend explains why and how the Rajpur-Sonarpur municipal area has seen the maximum decadal growth and extreme density rise (in population) during 1991-2001.        
	Similarly, several wards under the Calcutta Municipal Corporation along the EM Bypass and Metiabruz, where the Muslims from the Sunderbans have settled, have seen high growth during the period, though Calcuttas overall rate of population increase has slowed from earlier censuses. The migration is adding to the population stress on a city with a crumbling infrastructure.        
	Sonarpur became the chosen land because it was the closest they could get to Calcutta by train without entering the boro shohor, the big city. Calcutta was beyond their means. They were looking for odd jobs to survive and surviving in the city would have been impossible. So they stayed in Sonarpur and travelled daily to the city in search of work, said Mridul Mridha who left his home on Bally island and came to Sonarpur in the early Nineties.        
	Over 50,000 people from the Sunderbans have set up home in places that are within a 3-km radius from Sonarpur station. These are the people Bishnupada and his family are fleeing to.        
	Although it is no secret that people are migrating from the Sunderbans and heading to Sonarpur, the government has not recognised the phenomenon of climate refugees, though for some years it has been putting up advertisements announcing, To save Calcutta, save the Sunderbans.        
	As the Sunderbans reach Calcuttas outskirts, no effort is evident to save either.        
	So Bishnupada the bard goes looking for menial work to Calcutta, to join perhaps the army of autorickshaw drivers one day, his wife the battalion of maids.        
	Says the kabiyal: In the Sunderbans if you mentioned my name to anybody, they would recognise me instantly. But here my talent is useless. I cannot stay here forever. But I do not know what to do to organise my life.        
	His life had been faltering along the battered reeds of a harmonium. The money was meagre but the music was playing. He knows even if he strikes up a few notes on his Aila-afflicted harmonium, the money will not start trickling in again. This is no place for music.                          JAYANTA BASU AND ZEESHAN JAWED

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Salmans got no tickets to sell
                                                                                                               Salmans got no tickets to sell
  - Wanted off screen, Khan waves at plex amp; wows stadium          PRATIM D. GUPTA                          Salman Khan jiving to Just chill at the Salt Lake stadium on Friday evening.   Picture by Aranya Sen                                              
	They mob him so badly that he beats a hasty retreat from the airport, they cramp him so much that he can barely touch a football, they go wild when he takes the stage for a few minutes, but they dont always watch his movies.        
	Such is Calcuttas curious love affair with Salman Khan.        
	On a whirlwind trip to the city on Friday, Salman was stumped when he had tickets to sell but none of his movies to sell them for at a multiplex booking counter.        
	Main Aurr Mrs Khanna, which had released last Friday, was no longer playing at the plex and advances for London Dreams, releasing on October 30, were yet to open.        
	No one wants to watch me as a common man what can I do? Salman told Metro, tongue firmly in cheek. They made Wanted one of the biggest hits of the year but no one wants to see me as the regular guy of Main Aurr Mrs Khanna.        
	So all Salman could do was wave around at INOX (City Centre) in the afternoon in a loose white full-sleeve tee before hitting Salt Lake Stadium in the evening in a body-hugging black Being Human (his charity organisation) tee.        
	Last time when I had come (to play a football match at the Mohammedan Sporting Club grounds to promote Wanted), itni mohabbat, itni izzat mili ki hum sab darr gaye (the crowds showered us with so much love that we got scared) and we had to go back. I had committed that I would come back and so here I am.        
	The Wanted  and Dus Ka Dum  star did more than he had committed to. In the afternoon he had made it clear that he had not come to perform at the stadium but perform he did. The crowd at the stadium might have been just a fraction of its capacity  blame it on the organisers  but Salman made it an evening to remember. He not only mouthed his popular movie dialogues but also shook a leg to his chartbusters like Just chill and Mujhse shaadi karogi.        
	I have a huge fan base here. Every time I have come here, the excitement is so high that it always leads to panic and I never get to spend quality time. I cant forget the trip when I was sent back from the airport. They said: Dont enter the city, we cant take responsibility, you have to go back.        
	But on Friday, he made the most of his trip. Besides connecting with his Calcutta fans, Salman had his fill of mishti doi as the half-empty bowl on the table in his hotel suite would testify.         
	I just love it. And I love the city. Cant Mumbai be brought nearer to Calcutta or Calcutta nearer to Mumbai? So that it takes lesser time to go back and forth. Bahut lambi flight hai bhai!

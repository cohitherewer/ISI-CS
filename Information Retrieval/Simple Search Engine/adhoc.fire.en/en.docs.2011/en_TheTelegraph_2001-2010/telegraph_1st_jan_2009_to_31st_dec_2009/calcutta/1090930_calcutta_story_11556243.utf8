                      Images of the Divine                    Through history, human beings have come up with various names and forms for the Divine. In Hinduism, the different Gods and Goddesses represent the various forms of the concept of single supreme divinity that this ancient religion is founded on and reflect an intimate knowledge of the Divine on various levels. Deva-Devi III, the ongoing group exhibition of paintings, features images of several male and female Hindu deities. In the show, each artist has portrayed his favourite deity in the form and colours of his choice, making this an extremely vibrant collection. The ever-popular Ganesha is easily recognisable as the elephant-deity riding a mouse. Ganesha is depicted with the curved thrunk and ear of an elephant and the huge pot-belly of a man. Rama and Krishna, both depcited as dark-skinned, are perhaps the most famous divine incarnations. Among female forms of the Divine included here are Kali, Durga, Lakshmi and Saraswati, who represent different feminine qualities and functions of the Divine. While Kali portrays destructive energy, Lakshmi the nourishing and Saraswati the creative, Durga is the divine Mother in her protective role. Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity, is visualised as a beautiful woman of golden complexion, seated on a full-bloomed lotus and holding a lotus bud. Durga is portrayed riding a lion and carrying weapons in each of her 10 arms, slaying Mahisasura. The fearful form of Durga, Kali is usually depicted dancing on the prone form of Shiva and wearing a string of severed human heads around her neck and a skirt made of human arms.

	An RPF constable posted at Rabindra Sadan Metro station accidentally fired his gun on Sunday evening. No one was injured as the bullet hit the floor.        
	Constables Rakesh Ray and S. Mahato, who were standing in front of the metal detector gate near the booking counters at the Tollygunge end, have been suspended for dereliction of duty.

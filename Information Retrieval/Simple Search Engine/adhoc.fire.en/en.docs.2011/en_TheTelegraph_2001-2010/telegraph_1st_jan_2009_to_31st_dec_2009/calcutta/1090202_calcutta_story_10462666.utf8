The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Service centres to ease civic woes
                                                                                                               Service centres to ease civic woes
          A STAFF REPORTER      
	Come Tuesday, you neednt go to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) offices to deposit property tax and licence fees. Two retail civic outlets will be launched as part of the CMCs Rs 100-crore e-governance drive.        
	The e-Calcutta Citizen Service Centres  one on KN Sen Road near Bijon Setu and the other at VIP Market in Kankurgachhi  will be inaugurated by municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya and IT minister Debesh Das on Monday. They will start operations on Tuesday.        
	Citizens can deposit house tax, licence fees, fees for parking lots or advertisements at these centres. Building plan papers and birth, death and mutation certificates will soon be available from the centres, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.        
	Six more centres will be ready by August at AJC Bose Road (near Mullick Bazar), Belvedere, Lake Market, Gariahat Market, Bagha Jatin and Behala, he added.         
	With these service centres, the civic body is eyeing a much-needed image makeover. Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said that unlike the shabby civic offices, these centres would welcome visitors.        
	For instance, the centre at VIP Market will be air-conditioned and have modern seating arrangements and a television. Instead of standing in long queues, citizens can collect a token and sit in comfort while awaiting their turn.        
	The grievance redress system has also been computerised to fix the accountability of an errant officer, Bandyopadhyay said.        
	As soon as a complaint is filed, the computer will automatically email it to the officer concerned. But the email will not remain in his inbox permanently. If the officer fails to process the complaint and send it to the higher authorities, if required, within three or four days, the email will automatically reach the inbox of his superior, the municipal commissioner added.        
	A total of 15 days will be given to process the grievance complaint at below the controlling officer level.        
	If no one takes any steps within that time, the email will reach the the chief manager.        
	The e-governance drive is being funded by a grant by the British governments Department for International Development (DFID) for a capacity building programme.        
	Of the Rs 212-crore grant, Rs 100 crore has been spent for civic e-governance.        
	Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has been appointed as a consultant for the project.

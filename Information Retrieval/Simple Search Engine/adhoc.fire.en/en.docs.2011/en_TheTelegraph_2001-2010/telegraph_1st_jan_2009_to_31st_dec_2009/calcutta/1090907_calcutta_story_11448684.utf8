The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Library lacks spy cameras
                                                                                                               Library lacks spy cameras
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	National Library has been losing precious books and documents because of administrative apathy and lack of surveillance.         
	A library official said the absence of closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras was the biggest hurdle to curbing pilferage of books by readers.         
	Recently a reader was caught at the gate with pages of a rare book. He had cut them out with a blade, said the official. The offender, a trader, was handed over to cops.         
	Had CCTV cameras been in place, our security personnel would have caught him in the act. We have written to the Union ministry of culture for installation of spy cameras but have not got any response from them yet, said librarian R. Ramachandran.        
	There have been many such incidents, say library employees.        
	Some readers have even stolen books and managed to escape. There is no security system in place, said another library official.         
	He said the old reading room was fitted with four CCTVs. In 2005, the reading room was shifted to Bhasha Bhavan that houses over three million rare books, manuscripts, maps, periodicals and other precious documents.        
	Around 300 readers can study in the reading room of the new building. It is not possible for the two security guards who patrol the reading room to keep an eye on everyone, said Saibal Chakraborty, the general secretary of the National Library Staff Association.

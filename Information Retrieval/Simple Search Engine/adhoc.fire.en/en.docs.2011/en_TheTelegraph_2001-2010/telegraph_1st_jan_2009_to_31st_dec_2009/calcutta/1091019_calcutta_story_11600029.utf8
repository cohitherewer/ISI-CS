The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Shortage of judges adds to case pile
                                                                                                               Shortage of judges adds to case pile
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          Number crunch: Calcutta High Court                                  
	The number of cases pending in the high court has touched 3.5 lakh.        
	More than a lakh cases have been added to the pending list since December 2007 because of shortage of judges.        
	The sanctioned strength of judges in Calcutta High Court is 58 but it currently has only 18 judges.        
	The situation is not much better in the 202 subordinate courts across Bengal because of acute shortage of judges. In December 2007, nearly 13 lakh cases were pending in the trial courts. According to an estimate, the number of pending cases has crossed 15.5 lakh.        
	Of the 738 posts of judges in the lower courts, 216 are vacant.         
	Not only that, of the 222 higher judicial service posts, 61 are lying vacant.        
	A few months back, the high court chief justice told us that the state government had assured him that vacant posts in the higher judicial services would be filled up by September. But unfortunately nothing has been done yet, said Saradindu Biswas, a senior executive committee member of the West Bengal Bar Council, on Saturday.        
	When asked to comment on the issue, high court bar association president Sardar Amjad Ali said: Our repeated requests to both the central and the state governments have yielded no result. But a Supreme Court judgment banning lawyers strikes is preventing us from agitating in court. But this should not continue.        
	He alleged that scarcity of judges has affected proceedings in the court for the past eight months. Even criminal cases are not being heard on time, he said.        
	About two years ago, the names of eight advocates were recommended by the court administration for appointment as judges. Around the same time, the state law department suggested the names of five candidates from the higher judicial services for elevation to the posts of high court judges.        
	The candidates from the higher judicial services have been appointed but out of the eight advocates, only one has been appointed as a judge so far, said a senior court official.        
	A senior official of the state law department claimed that most of the vacant judge posts in the lower courts would be filled up by December. The process of appointing new judges is on. Most of the posts will be filled up by this year, he said.

                      A strange celebration                    Ablack comedy, which tends to sacrifice credibility to the horrors of the subconscious, Nandimukhs production Tetris Tamo Janmodibas is an adaptation of Harold Pinters The Birthday Party. An absurd drama in Pinters sense of the term, the play explores themes related to identity, alienation, relationships and the futility of existence.The action of the play takes place in the living-dining area of a seedy, squalid seaside hotel. A very proletarian Everyman called Samrendra has closeted himself here, detaching himelf from the outside world. Suddenly two people enter the scene: Gagan and Mahesh, agents of our imperious society, who come to claim him as one of them. In the sinister scene of Samrendras birthday party in which a terrifying game of blind-mans buff is played, Gagan and Mahesh reduce their victim to speechlessness. On the next day, they dress him up as a clown and he is marched off in a bowler-hat as an animal to the slaughter, a man without identity or self. Direction: Ashoke Chattopadhyay.

	Recruiters are shunning graduate engineers from Calcutta University because they study a year less than their BTech counterparts elsewhere.        
	Final-year students of eight three-year BTech courses petitioned vice-chancellor Suranjan Das earlier this week seeking a solution to the duration dilemma that has put their careers on the line.        
	Some of these courses are over 70 years old and regarded as a benchmark for excellence in technical education, but recruiters have become wary of giving us jobs because of the duration. Courses in other institutes span four years or eight semesters while we get our degrees in three years or six semesters, said a student.        
	The All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE) has made it mandatory for all graduation courses in technology to be completed over four years, with the minimum entry level being Higher Secondary pass. Calcutta University, however, takes in only science graduates for eight out of its 10 engineering courses with the AICTEs permission.         
	Although the quality of education remains high, recruiters who would earlier make a beeline for these graduates are now shunning them.         
	A recent advertisement seeking job applications from engineering graduates stated that applicants must give the details of the marks obtained by them in all eight semesters of their BTech course. I was unable to apply despite having an excellent academic record because ours is a course with just six semesters, said Tanima Das (name changed), a final-year electrical engineering student at Calcutta University.        
	Officials said companies could not refuse employment to engineers from Calcutta University on technical grounds because all its BTech courses  only two are for four years  were recognised by the AICTE.        
	Pro vice-chancellor (academic) Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee said a meeting would be held soon with the departments concerned to find a way to ensure that students of the university were not discriminated against.        
	Chatterjee said increasing the duration of the courses by a year  the AICTE has been asking the university to do so for a long time  would entail a lot of changes. The dean of technology, Sushanta Sen, said standards might fall if students were to be given admission after Higher Secondary. They have been designed to produce engineer graduates who can go on to do research. That is why only honours science graduates are eligible for admission, he added.        
	The BTech courses cover electrical engineering, instrumentation, information technology, optics, computer science and engineering, radio physics, chemical engineering, chemical technology, chemical engineering and polymer science. The main recruiters over the years have been the Defence Research and Development Organisation, Indian Space Research Organisation, Damodar Valley Corporation, BSNL, West Bengal State Electricity Board and Bharat Heavy Electricals.

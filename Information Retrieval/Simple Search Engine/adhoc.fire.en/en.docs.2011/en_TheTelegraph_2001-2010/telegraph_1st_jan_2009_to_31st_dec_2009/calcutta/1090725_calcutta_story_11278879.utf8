	The director and assistant director of an under-production Bengali film died in a road mishap at Uluberia early on Friday while returning to the city after a shooting schedule in Digha.        
	The car carrying director Suhasish Chatterjee, 51, and assistant director Himangshu Bikash Dey, 45, slammed into a stationary truck on National Highway 6 near Jelepara bridge, said police. The two were pronounced dead at Uluberia sub-divisional hospital.        
	Cinematographer Arindam Bhattacharya, assistant cinematographer Pravin Kumar Bangaria and driver Prashanta Das, who were also in the car, were admitted to hospital in critical condition.        
	Bangaria and Bhattacharya, who graduated from the Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute this year, were shifted to AMRI, Salt Lake.         
	The four were filming Antarin, starring Soumitra Chatterjee, Debasree Roy and Indrani Halder.

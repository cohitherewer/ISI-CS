The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Great divide on eve of verdict
                                                                                                               Great divide on eve of verdict
          OUR BUREAU                            Candidates have devised ways to make the wait bearable. Saugata Roy (top) is immersing himself in sleep; Mohammad Salim (below) is turning to Rabindrasangeet, ghazals and friends outside his political circle                                 
	North is sitting back while south is on the edge  Calcuttas traditional divide has united the arch-rivals in the final countdown.        
	The election office of Mohammad Salim, the CPM candidate from Calcutta North, was teeming with cadres till Wednesday when the city went to polls. On Friday morning, it was deserted except for a veteran comrade who was watching an exit poll between answering phone calls.        
	Till Wednesday, 20-40 cadres were working 18 hours a day. Now that the polls are over, everyones taking a break, said Premtosh Ray Chowdhury, 61. Aaj-i toh dibanidrar shomoy (Todays the day for siesta). The last few weeks were hectic.        
	Asked about Salims prospects, the leader was gung-ho. The Trinamul has been decimated in Calcutta North. The confidence was shared by Citus state committee secretary Debanjan Chakraborty. We are winning comfortably; the fight wasnt even close, crowed one of the key managers of Salims campaign.        
	The Trinamul poll office, too, wore a laid-back look though the activists were as sure about Sudip Bandyopadhyays victory as the comrades were about Salims. Most of our men are taking time off, said Sanjay Banerjee, chatting over tea with a handful of supporters.        
	Cross the divide and head south, you are greeted with anxious faces in both camps, busy taking stock and crunching numbers.        
	There isnt any time to relax. I have visited over a thousand villages campaigning for Mamatadi. Now that the polls are over, we are busy assigning counting agents, said Ranjit Dey, the state committee secretary of the Trinamul, sitting in the partys election office in Bhowanipore.        
	Seven men were busy figuring out the possible scenarios after the results are declared. Alok Dasgupta, one of them, did not entertain any doubt about Mamata Banerjees prospects. The results will overwhelmingly be in Didis favour, he asserted.        
	Busy yet buoyant were the CPM supporters, too. Niranjan Chatterjee, among the strategists of party candidate Rabin Deb, said: Our plans have worked well and we will win. But there is no scope for complacency.        
	The CPMs war room on Pratapaditya Road was abuzz with activity, with over 40 cadres chalking out their course of action and only occasionally stealing a glance at the TV.        
	In anticipation of victory, both sides have placed orders for sweets. We will produce at least 2,000 additional pieces of rasogolla and gulab jamun, said Sudip Mullick of Balaram Mullick and Radharaman Mullick, of south Calcutta. We will procure more milk tomorrow as the demand will shoot up, said Manjulika Das of KC Das.

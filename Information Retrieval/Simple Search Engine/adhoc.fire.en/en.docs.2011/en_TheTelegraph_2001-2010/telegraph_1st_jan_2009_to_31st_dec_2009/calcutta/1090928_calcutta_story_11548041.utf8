The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Navami true spirit in oldies day out 
                                                                                                               Navami true spirit in oldies day out 
          KARO CHRISTINE KUMAR                          Senior citizens take a breather at the Manicktalla Chaltabagan puja on Sunday. Picture by Amit Datta                                  
	Some had walking sticks and others had hearing aids, but they all wore wide smiles. After all, they were on a Navami outing they will not forget.        
	Forty-six senior citizens registered with Pronam, a 24-hour helpline for senior citizens, were taken to see award-winning pandals of CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja on Sunday morning.        
	The helpline launched in June this year is a joint initiative of Calcutta police and The Bengal, an organisation of prominent Calcuttans.        
	Getting past long queues and crowds during the pujas is a nightmare. We avoid going out because we fear that we will be trampled on and pushed around. So this is a really special Puja treat, said an emotional Somnath Ghosh, 73, who had signed up for the trip from his Chetla home.        
	The team of 46, escorted by the police and filmmaker Anandi Ghose of The Bengal, started out in two private buses at 9.30am. Their first stop was Deshapriya Park after which they headed for Mohammad Ali Park. Next up was Manicktalla Chaltabagan Lohapatti, the winner of the Puja that Cares award. The final stop was Mudiali Club, a Four Star puja.        
	Excited and enthusiastic, the senior citizens were not unlike schoolchildren on a picnic, some singing along in the bus and others exchanging numbers with new-found friends.        
	I stay alone on Ballygunge Circular Road. I just see my para pandal every year because my legs cant take me far. This time, after years, I have come pandal-hopping and also made many friends, smiled Purobi Hor, 78.        
	Accompanying them with a gentle hand, Anandi observed how they were exchanging numbers to keep in touch, slowly building this little community to give them a sense of belonging.        
	We feel loved and cared for. What our children could not do, this initiative is doing for us, said Shanti, 66 and Dinesh Jha, 70, who registered with Pronam after reading about the helpline in Metro.        
	Even health restrictions seemed forgotten on the oldies day out. The team that stopped at the Chaltabagan pandal merrily dug into samosa, patties and mishti.        
	Between bites, Dwijendra Lal Bhattacharya, 75, had plenty to share. No one cares for senior citizens. The government should introduce such trips on a national level so that more people like us can benefit.        
	Heads bent in reverence, shaking hands joined in prayer, an elderly couple made a last but lengthy wish in front of the goddess on Navami. We hope, for the sake of so many hapless senior citizens like us, that this effort is sustained for years to come, said Sushil, 81, and Namita Chatterjee, 78, from Shyambazar.        
	The true spirit of Puja is clearly shining through.

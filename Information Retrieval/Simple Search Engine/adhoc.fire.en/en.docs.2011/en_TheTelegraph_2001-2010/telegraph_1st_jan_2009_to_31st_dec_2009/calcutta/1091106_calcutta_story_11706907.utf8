                      Embroidered art                    A traditional art form of Bengal, kantha-embroidery work was originally created by village women for household use. Their uniqueness lay in their personalised, intricate designs and skilful craftsmanship. However, this beautiful art form gradually went out of vogue. Born and brought up in Santiniketan, artist Biswajit Mukhopadhyay has devoted himself to the revival of this nearly-forgotten rural craft. Evolving new sets of designs that are more spontaneous, powerful and innovative, he has given kantha-embroidery a new lease of life. He studied the arts of different tribal groups in order to unravel their mystery, their symbolic meaning and magic spell, and introduced them into his own designs. Various folk arts of Bengal and Bihar find expression in his work. The ongoing show of his recently-stitched paintings and drawings are interesting mainly for their pictorial quality; interweaving various motifs, colours and textures, he has created works that bear testimony to the artists imagination, originality and creative passion. At times representative and at others abstract and symbolic, his works can be used as shawls, spreads and wall-hangings, or can deserve pride of possession simply as outstanding works of art.                    Event: An exhibition of kantha-stitch paintings and drawings by Biswajit Mukhopadhyay When: Till November 11; 3 pm - 8 pm Where: Academy of Fine Arts, Central Gallery

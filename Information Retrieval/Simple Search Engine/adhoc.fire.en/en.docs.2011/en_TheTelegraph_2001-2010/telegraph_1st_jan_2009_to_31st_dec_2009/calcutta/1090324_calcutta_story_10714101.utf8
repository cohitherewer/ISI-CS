The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fracas over fee-back
                                                                                                               Fracas over fee-back
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	At least eight students of a management institute in Salt Lake were injured when police charged at them while they were demanding a full refund of their course fees citing inadequate campus placements.        
	All 118 MBA students of the Calcutta campus of the Siliguri Institute of Technology, a part of the Techno India Group, had assembled in front of the Sector V office of managing director Satyam Roy Choudhury on Monday to complain about the lack of job offers this season.        
	Roy Choudhury refused to meet more than four representatives, triggering an impromptu road blockade. The police contingent that was already in front of the office when the students had arrived swung into action when one of the protesters smashed the windscreen of a minitruck.         
	One student was beaten up and detained, and at least eight more were injured. But additional SP Debabrata Das denied that the students were lathicharged. They were the ones who turned violent, he said.        
	The institute, one of the 14 campuses run by the Techno India Group, has been simmering since Friday, when 61 students of the second year met Roy Chowdhury to demand a refund of all fees.         
	The group argued that the institute had no right to take Rs 1.9 lakh each from them over four semesters after managing only one campus placement this year. Not a single large company has come to our campus. The jobs that have come our way are all with low salaries, a student alleged.        
	Some students claimed that classes werent being held regularly and the teachers were incompetent.         
	Full classes have not been held for the last two semesters. We havent had summer internships either, Sougata Chowdhury, a second-year student, said.        
	Arun Kr Banerjee, the head of the department of management studies, contested the allegations.         
	Some students havent paid the fees for the third and fourth semesters. They are the ones instigating the other students, he said.

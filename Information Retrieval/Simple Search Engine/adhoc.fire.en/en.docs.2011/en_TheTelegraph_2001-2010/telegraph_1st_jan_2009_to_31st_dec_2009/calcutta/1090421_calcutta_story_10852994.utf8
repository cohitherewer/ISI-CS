The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Just beat it  the heat   Another 48-hour scorcher
                                                                                                               Just beat it  the heat     Another 48-hour scorcher
          A STAFF REPORTER                                                  
	The mercury dipped marginally on Monday but the weatherman warned that the heat wave-like condition would continue for the next 48 hours.        
	The days maximum temperature, as recorded by the Alipore Met office, was 39.4 degrees Celsius  1.8 degrees less than Sundays but still three degrees above normal.        
	The discomfort index was 60.2 degrees Celsius, five degrees above normal. On Sunday, the index had crossed 64.        
	The Met office initially said Tuesdays maximum temperature could be around 38 degrees, with possibility of rain or thundershower towards evening. But late on Monday that forecast was changed to a forbidding 41 degrees, with no rain in sight.        
	The intense heat condition is likely to continue in south Bengal districts over the next 48 hours, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre, Alipore.        
	A strong anticyclonic formation moving through central India towards the east has resulted in hot winds in the form of northwesterlys and westerlys sweeping south Bengal. The effect has been heightened by low moisture content in the lower troposphere, he added.        
	With the sun beating down, many commuters decided to duck for cover, leading to a jump in the Metro Railway footfall. Compared with other Mondays, there has been a 10-12 per cent rise in passenger load, said a Metro official.         
	I could have taken a bus from my Lake Town home to BBD Bag. Instead, I took the Metro to beat the heat, said Sarnath Chatterjee, a trader.        
	There has been a sharp decline in business, admitted Abashesh Daw, of the minibus coordination committee.

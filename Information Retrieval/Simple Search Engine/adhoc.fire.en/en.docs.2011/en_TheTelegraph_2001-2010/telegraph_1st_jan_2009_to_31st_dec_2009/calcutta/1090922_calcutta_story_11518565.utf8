The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Plots there, but not bare necessities
                                                                                                               Plots there, but not bare necessities
          SUBHRO SAHA AND CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE                          A Hidco plot in Action Area III of New Town. (Sanat Kr Sinha)                                  
	The much-awaited aye from Azim Premji or N.R. Narayana Murthy hasnt reached Writers Buildings yet, but if the tech majors do decide to set up campuses in Rajarhat in a hurry, the beleaguered Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government will suffer another face loss.        
	Last week, while announcing 45 acres each in Rajarhat Action Area III for Wipro and Infosys, the chief minister had claimed that the township had all the necessary social infrastructure to host the two tech bellwethers.        
	But developers with projects in the township have rubbished Bhattacharjees claims. The area lacks in core infrastructure elements like roads, power, drinking water, storm water drainage and waste management, said a realtor whose project has remained in work-in-progress mode for over two years because of poor infrastructure.        
	Action Area III, spread over 783 hectares, is part of the 3,087hectare Rajarhat-New Town township. Till now, 24x7 power supply remains a distant dream here. Most of the on-going projects  like Shapoorji Pallonjis mass housing complex, DLFs residential towers and Bengal Unitechs IT Park  are forced to make do with temporary power and Gensets.        
	Availability of land at a fair price is just one of the many factors in the decision-making process for companies like Wipro and Infosys to say yes to a campus site. They serve clients across the globe from their development centres and so bandwidth and constant supply of quality power are necessary for them to do business, said an IT industry insider.        
	The tract of land earmarked by the government for Infosys and Wipro is near the upcoming Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre and the Indian Institute of Technology campuses. The government is trying to give the two companies good neighbours, but what is important is proper infrastructure, said the CEO of a city-based IT company.        
	Physical connectivity in terms of well-laid roads, civic amenities like water supply, proper sewerage disposal and waste management system, and proper law-and-order conditions are the other factors the IT majors will consider before deciding on their location.        
	Hidco, a state government agency, has been developing the township since the mid-1990s. Though Hidcos method of land acquisition without any political trouble has won kudos from the developers, the agencys performance in creating infrastructure has been termed miserable.        
	The infrastructure must always come as an upfront investment. However, Hidco chose to wait for a critical mass to inhabit the township before making that investment. The result is there for everyone to see, said an official of a leading realty firm.        
	The only visible contribution of Hidco  the construction of road  also lies in tatters with a mass of potholes and deep trenches, filled with water, on either side.        
	Even transporting building materials in trucks to the construction sites in the area has become a nightmare for all of us, said a developer.         
	So, even if the CM delivers on his promise of handing over the land to Wipro and Infosys right now, the companies will be able to do precious little with it for a while.

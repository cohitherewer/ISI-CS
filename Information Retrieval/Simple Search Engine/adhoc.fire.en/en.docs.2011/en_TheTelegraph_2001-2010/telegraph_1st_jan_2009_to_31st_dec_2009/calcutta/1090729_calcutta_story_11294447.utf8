          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A man in his 30s was arrested on Tuesday for duping at least 10 people of goods worth around Rs 10 lakh. Sukamal Das, a glib talker, would cheat his victims by offering lucrative exchange deals for electronic appliances, police said.         
	Das would visit homes and manage to win the confidence of residents by upgrading their gadgets at a low cost, said city detective chief Jawed Shamim.        
	After gaining their trust, he would make new contacts through them and cheat them, he added.         
	Das went on a duping spree across the city till one of his victims, Anima Ganguly of Lake Gardens, lodged a police complaint in February that she had been cheated of Rs 17,000.         
	A resident of Garia, Das would rarely return home at night. A school dropout, he speaks fluent English. We laid a trap for him with the help of one of his clients and arrested him, said an officer.         
	Cops believe Das has duped more people and with his arrest, several other victims would come forward.

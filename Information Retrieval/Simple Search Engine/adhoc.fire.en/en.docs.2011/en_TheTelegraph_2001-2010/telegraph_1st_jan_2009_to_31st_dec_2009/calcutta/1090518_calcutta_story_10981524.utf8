The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Lets talk about Mamata, say GenX adda zones
                                                                                                               Lets talk about Mamata, say GenX adda zones
  - Politics is the buzzword this wonder weekend for PYTs and others over coffee or cocktails          POULOMI BANERJEE AND RANJABATI DAS                                                        
	Mamata Banerjee needs a stylist, feels Naved Ahmed, a 24-year-old employee of an international airline. She could go to the gym, maybe. She definitely needs to change her wardrobe.        
	Is image everything, no matter what the numbers say?        
	Naved wasnt aware of the irony  that sitting in City Centre, his chosen subject of discussion had rendered his own point moot. That Mamata Banerjees cotton sari had not needed a designer label to infiltrate the citys elite bastions on Sunday after history was made the day before.        
	But B.D. Dutta, a retired intelligence officer, saw the humour. At South City Mall, the elated Dutta, who confessed a dream of joining ranks with Didi, pointed out that Mamata doesnt believe in malls. I doubt whether the type of sari she likes will be available here, he smiled. At 68, he has been waiting for a result like this for many elections now.        
	Politics was the talking point of PLU (people like us) and PYTs (pretty young things) over the clinking of cups and chiming of cash registers at leisure spots around town this weekend. And Mamata was the password.        
	For 37-year-old Praveen Kanodia, during this weekends partying at Plush on Theatre Road, talk veered away from the Indian Premier League and to the Indian Political League. The election result was another reason to party, laughed the businessman. While Praveen felt Mamatas image had already changed for the better, he had two more requests for her: that she ban bandhs and buy herself a decent pair of slippers.        
	Saira Shah Halim, 29, also at Plush, felt a clean image called for smart clothes and not necessarily designer threads. And jobs for youth and no bandhs led her list of wants. Her message for Mamata? Try and appeal more to the youth. And yes, buy a dependable pair of slippers.        
	Fellow party-person Sisir Jalan, 30, expressed reservations about how far this success would be repeated in the 2011 Assembly polls. More support to industry and no bandhs is what we need, he stressed. To be more soft-spoken and use sunscreen is what Mamata needs, he added.        
	A gang of young professionals shopping at South City Mall on Sunday just could not stop talking about Mamata. For some, she was too volatile to be trusted with the chief ministership while for the others she was a necessary evil to end the monopoly of Left rule.        
	But an 18-year-old student at a coffee shop on Lake Road, refused to be swayed by the Mamata wave. She should change everything about herself, said Soumava Bedajna. Far from recommending reliable footwear for Mamata, he would prefer giving her the boot for driving the Nano out.

  - Rule-flout truck rams into police van, allows prisoners to break free          OUR BUREAU                          The police van damaged in the accident on Tuesday morning.                                        
	Two convicts and an undertrial escaped from a police van ferrying 20 prisoners when it overturned after colliding head-on with a truck moving down the wrong flank of Jessore Road, near the airport, on Tuesday morning.        
	Of the three, Ganpat Rao and Balbir Singh were found guilty on Monday of murdering homemaker Chandana Das by throwing her off a third-floor balcony while looting her Kanchrapara home in February 2008. The duo, in their forties, were being taken from Dum Dum Central jail to a Barrackpore fast track court to hear their sentence.        
	Munir-ul-Ali, who was arrested in connection with a robbery in Ghola, is the third prisoner who fled. The truck driver is also absconding. The sub-inspector and the two constables in the police van sustained minor injuries, as did the driver.         
	The accident occurred around 11am. The truck, which was coming from the direction of Barasat, sped down the wrong flank of the road and smashed into the van. The police vehicle turned turtle on impact, said Raju Das, a barber who saw the mishap from his shop.        
	As the cops and the other prisoners cried out for help, three men wriggled out through the partially broken rear door and ran towards the airport gate No. 2 bus stop, added Das.        
	The other prisoners in the van did not try to escape and some even helped shopkeepers and pedestrians to rescue those who were trapped in the vehicle, according to witnesses.        
	We have started a departmental inquiry on how the prisoners escaped. The police have been alerted at places where the fugitives might try to take shelter, said P.K. Tripathi, the acting superintendent of North 24-Parganas police.        
	Several prisoners have given cops the slip this year, including an accused in the marmoset theft.

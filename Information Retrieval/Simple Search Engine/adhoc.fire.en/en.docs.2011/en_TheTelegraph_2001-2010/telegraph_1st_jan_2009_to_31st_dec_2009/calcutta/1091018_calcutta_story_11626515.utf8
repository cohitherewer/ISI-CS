										      Free radical                        A public display of affection				                           
	The other day, I had walked into a cafe to escape the frenzied shoppers who seemed to be headed in my direction. The cafe was small but expensive, and shafts of sunlight touched the gleaming wood-topped tables inside. I chose a seat by an arched window, sipped tea, and sat watching the busy world go by.         
	Suddenly, I was jolted by a loud noise, as if a heavy object had fallen on the ground. I looked in the direction of the noise and saw a couple sitting on the table opposite mine. The girl, young but ordinary looking, had dropped her bag, and, moments later, I realised why. Her lover, the shabby man sitting next to her, had begun stroking her hand. She must have been shocked for she had dropped her bag, but her dismay soon gave way to pleasure and she began to purr.         
	Stroking, in this instance, was a misnomer, for the mans hand moved vigorously, and I could occasionally hear the rustling noise when their skin touched.        
	The lit-up cafe contained four creatures: the damsel with her unmistakable feline manners, her companion who was behaving like a caveman trying to light a fire, a dozing waiter and myself. I had always believed that my views on public displays of affection differed from the Thackerays; yet, the mans frantic manner had left me perturbed. There was nothing gentle or refined about this amorous display. In a way, it was coarse, unabashed, and disconcertingly lustful.        
	I reflected on my discomfiture, and was convinced that my conscience had been rattled by my prejudice. A shabbily dressed man had no business getting intimate with his plain-jane girlfriend in a fancy restaurant. He had trespassed into a space meant for beautiful men and women who usually talked in low whispers and touched each other ever so gently.        
	I did not have any trouble following the story of their lives in the quiet room. The mans voice boomed, and the girls laughter was shrill. He was employed in a small firm and had saved money to take her out. He worked hard, and promised that some day he would take her away from her family, which was against the match. She said little, but laughed a lot. I felt happy for her, but bristled at the man for showing me what I was inside.        
	Till the moment the bag dropped again. This time, it was the mans fault. He had seen something outside the window that had made him move away suddenly from the startled girl. I followed his gaze and saw him staring, ashen-faced, at a much older man and his family passing by. They hadnt noticed him, busy as they were with their shopping bags. I realised that they might be members of the girls family, and I secretly hoped that they would drop in for a cup of tea.        
	But that wasnt to be. They moved away chattering, dragging their bags behind them. But it seemed that they had cast their shadows behind. Something had changed between the man and the girl; she looked forlorn, and stared at the man who had pinched my conscience earlier. He looked away, unable to meet her gaze, and kept his hands to himself.        
	I paid and left. My revenge had been sweet, and it tasted better than the tea.       UDDALAK MUKHERJEE

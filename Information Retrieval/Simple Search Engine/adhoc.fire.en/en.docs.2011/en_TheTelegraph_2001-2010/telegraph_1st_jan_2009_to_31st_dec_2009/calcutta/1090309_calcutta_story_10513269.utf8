The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Film buffs turn to rental services
                                                                                                               Film buffs turn to rental services
  - Choice of mainstream amp; world cinema           MEGHDEEP BHATTACHARYYA                          A still from The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. Movie rental services are trying to attract customers by offering latest releases at affordable prices                                        
	The downturn may have curtailed entertainment budgets but city cinema buffs need not fret. Movie rental services are here with a wide selection of films, easy renting options and affordable rates.         
	The clutch of movie rental companies in Calcutta are offering Slumdog Millionaire or The Curious Case of Benjamin Button in the comfort of your living room couch for less than the price of multiplex popcorn. And the movie of choice  be it Vittorio De Sicas neorealist classic or Youngistans Rang De Basanti  is only a mouse click or an SMS away.        
	I watch trailers and clips online and read synopses before ordering films online. The DVDs are dropped at and picked up from my doorstep. Affordable rental plans, customised billing and credit card payment facilities are added advantages. I have stopped going to multiplexes, says Sanjukta Ganguly, a 24-year-old dentist.        
	The trend started in 2006, with Chennai-based rental chain Cinema Paradiso setting up shop. The more than 5,000 titles in their library cover world cinema classics as well as mainstream fare. The Directors Special section stocks works of great film-makers from Ray and Rossellini, Kurosawa and Kieslowski.         
	Other rental services like Seventymm.com and Showtime, a Nimbus Communication venture, are also setting their sights on the city.        
	The biggest entry was BIGFlix, a wing of Reliance Big Entertainment, with 18,000 titles in its kitty.        
	The films are divided into 38 categories like classics (including films like North by Northwest and Spartacus), Indian films you must watch before you die (including Omkara and Dil Chahta Hai), feel good and inspirational titles (Finding Neverland, Any Given Sunday) and movies starring sexiest women (A Mighty Heart, The Interpreter).        
	The response in Calcutta has been on a par with the rest of the country, said BIGFlix chief operating officer Kamal Gianchandani.        
	The rental companies score over local video libraries in terms of wide selection and original discs, according to members.        
	Now whenever my friends and I want to catch a good film we rent a DVD online or via SMS and enjoy it at somebodys home, said Kalyan Basu, a banker.

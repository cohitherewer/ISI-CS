          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Three employees of a drugstore in Salt Lake were injured after a drunken man allegedly slashed them with a pocket-knife on Thursday evening.         
	Police said Sujit Chakraborty, a resident of Mahavir Vikas Housing Estate in HC Block, had attacked the trio at a GD Market store for allegedly refusing to accept his international debit card on Wednesday.        
	Ranjit Guchhayet, 30, was admitted to hospital with deep cuts under his right eye and two others  Milan Mondol, 25 and Rajiv Maiti, 29  received stitches on their hands.        
	On Wednesday Sujit bought aspirin from the store and asked the storeowner to swipe his debit card, saying he also wanted to check why it was rejected at a petrol pump earlier in the day. The storeowner said his card-punching machine was not working and asked him to pay cash. Sujit was drunk and got involved in a heated discussion with the store employees, who pushed him out of the shop, said a senior officer of Bidhannagar South police station.        
	Sujit returned to the store on Thursday evening in his fathers car and demanded to see the store licence. When the employees refused, he took out a one-inch long knife from his pocket and slashed them randomly, before others nabbed him. He was intoxicated on Thursday, too the officer said.        
	A mob beat up Sujit and damaged his car before handing him over to the police. Cops said Sujit  the son of a retired doctor of brigadier rank in the army  was a drug addict and often got into fights with residents.        
	Sujit used to work as a software engineer in the US but returned to India a few years back. He does business online now. He stays alone and often returns home drunk. His parents live in Mumbai, said a neighbour.

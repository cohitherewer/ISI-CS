The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Reds go missing in green city   Day of desertion amp; delight
                                                                                                               Reds go missing in green city
   Day of desertion amp; delight
          OUR BUREAU                      While you were sleeping: The sleepy and shut election office of Mohammad Salim on Maharshi Debendra Road (above) was a study in contrast with the Trinamul Congress revelry at a centre in Calcutta North (below) on Sunday.   Pictures by Amit Datta                                      
	Sunday was a forced holiday for Left Front workers and a welcome working day for their Trinamul Congress counterparts.         
	The mood of the red brigade was encapsulated in the desolation of the CPM pit stops across town  from the shuttered entrance of Mohammad Salims election office on Maharshi Debendra Road to Rabin Debs deserted campaign office at Chetla.        
	As the rank and file of the Left Front mourned the debacle in private, Trinamul Congress workers were all over the city with flags, festoons, music and mishti to celebrate a historic victory.         
	The common mans verdict is a great leveller public-er ekta angul oder shuiye diyechhe (the finger that presses the button has flattened them), said Poltu Dam, frenetically waving two Trinamul flags.        
	Manash Chatterjee, a party leader from south Dum Dum, cut Poltu short. Dont you know Didi (Mamata Banerjee) has clamped a ban on talking about the CPM? he shouted.         
	Diktat from Didi notwithstanding, Trinamul leaders found it hard to hold back party workers straining at the leash to give it back to them.         
	We have received instructions not to incite anybody but emotions are not so easy to control, said Samar Das, placing an order for 50 packets of sweets in a Behala shop.        
	Dum Dum Road, Jessore Road, Central Avenue, APC Road, Rashbehari Avenue, Tollygunge, Jadavpur, Behala  wherever victory was savoured, the colour of celebration was green.        
	As Trinamul supporters partied till late in the evening, the lights went out at the CPM hubs that would be buzzing with activity beyond midnight every day over the past month.         
	There would be at least 10 fancy vehicles of top leaders parked on the road at any given time. I have not seen one since Saturday evening, said Montu Hazra, outside the CPMs Dum Dum office.        
	While the three-storeyed building was deserted, the small Trinamul office barely 500 metres away on Motijheel Road was chock-a-block with revellers. I have never seen so many people here before. You can hardly breathe, said a party worker.        
	In south Calcutta, groups of CPM workers did gather in some offices to discuss what went wrong. Metro found five workers huddled in a ward office at Siriti. This is like the day after a bad result in a school exam. We need to study hard to perform better next time, philosophised Buddhadeb Gautam.        
	Some CPM supporters seemed ready to run, for the first time in decades. Ramen Banerjee (name changed ) said he was looking for a new house. We are known to be active CPM supporters and we fear it will be difficult for us to live in our ancestral house now. They will target us, said the resident of north Calcutta.

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A smart, young couple, who allegedly robbed several Howrah homes after befriending the residents, have been arrested.         
	Biswajit Ghosh, 28, and his wife Soma, 25, were picked up from their rented home in Ballys Hazrapara last Saturday. They allegedly stole valuables worth several lakhs over the past two years.        
	According to police, Biswajit used to strike up a conversation with people in public places and managed to get himself invited to their homes. After a few visits, he would introduce his wife to the targeted family.        
	Once Biswajit, over the course of several visits, had figured out the layout of the house and the schedule of the family members, he would chalk out a robbery plan that his wife would execute, said an investigator.         
	Soma would visit the house when not more than a couple of people were around and clean out the cupboards behind their back, taking advantage of the rapport that her husband had built with the family, added the investigator.         
	A robbery on July 4 in the house of Chaitali Bagchi, the head teacher of Belur Girls High School, put cops on the trail of the couple.        
	Soma visited the house, also in Bally Hazrapara, when Chaitalis teenaged son Ritham was in a ground-floor room with a friend. When she asked for Chaitalis niece, Ritham asked Soma to go to his cousins room on the first floor.         
	Once upstairs, Soma headed to the other room on the floor. The key to the almirah in the room was kept on the dressing table. Soma allegedly took jewellery worth over Rs 1 lakh from the almirah and locked it before walking out of the house. The family lodged a police complaint.        
	We initially thought it was a false complaint. But during investigation, we came to know of a similar theft at Liluah six months ago, said an officer.        
	Based on the descriptions by the family members, a sketch of Soma was drawn. She and Biswajit were tracked down soon after. The two were remanded in judicial custody on Friday.         
	Two men, to whom the couple allegedly sold the stolen goods, were arrested in Belgachhia and Baranagar.

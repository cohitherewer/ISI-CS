The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | JU tunnel to new campus
                                                                                                               JU tunnel to new campus
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	A tunnel below Raja Subodh Mullick Road may soon connect Jadavpur University (JU) with the National Instruments Ltd premises, situated opposite the campus. The premises of the sick unit was taken over by JU last month.        
	National Instruments, spread over nearly eight acres, will be an extension of our main campus. We have approached the government to construct a tunnel connecting the two premises for the convenience of our students, teachers and other staff members, said JU vice-chancellor P.N. Ghosh.        
	As soon as the state government gives the green light, the university will prepare a detailed plan for the project and submit it to the government for approval.        
	JU had approached the state government nearly five years ago with a proposal to take over National Instruments and use it as an advanced research laboratory. Research projects have not been undertaken at National Instruments, which has a large, well-equipped laboratory, for years.        
	Central government officials had visited National Instruments in September and confirmed the handover to the university.        
	Ghosh said JU had plans to set up a business incubation and innovation centre on the new campus, where students, teachers and research scholars would develop innovative entrepreneurial ideas.        
	Entrepreneurs will be able to pay and use the National Instruments infrastructure for up to three years to develop products.        
	The National Instrument premises will also be used for offering postgraduate courses in environment management, energy management, disaster management, transport management, environment law and intellectual and property rights.        
	Ghosh said the renovation of the National Instrument premises, to cost around Rs 10 crore, would start soon. The new campus will be ready in 2010.

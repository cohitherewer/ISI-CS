The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Love dies young for her
                                                                                                               Love dies young for her
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	A campus love story that had culminated in marriage ended tragically five weeks later with the girl, a former Jadavpur University student, dying under mysterious circumstances and police arresting her husband and in-laws.        
	The family of 27-year-old Sohini Basu, who married Arup Ghosh on May 5, said in the FIR with Kasba police station that she was unhappy since the wedding and might have been tortured to death.         
	Police suspect the communications professional, who worked in a Lansdowne firm, committed suicide.        
	There are strangulation marks on her neck, but we need the post-mortem report to confirm suicide. Her husband claims he found her hanging, said S.K. Chaudhury, the additional superintendent of police (industrial) of South 24-Parganas.        
	Sohini, a graduate in English with a diploma in mass communication from Jadavpur University and a masters from Rabindra Bharati, had met Arup on the BT Road campus.        
	She last spoke to her parents over phone from her new home, off Garfa, around 10.30 on Wednesday night.         
	Ma, aami chole ashbo (mom, I will come back to you), father Amal, a retired Ordnance Factory employee, quoted her as telling her mother Nita.        
	Amal dialled Sohinis cellphone twice between 11.30pm and midnight to enquire whether she was all right but she didnt take the calls. He then called his son-in-law, who said Sohini did not answer the phone because she was in the bathroom.        
	I made the mistake of not asking him to pass the phone to my daughter so that I could speak to her then. I should have known better; she had visited us earlier in the day and seemed reluctant to return. When she had called around 10.30pm Sohini told her mother that she would stay with us...I now realise it was an SOS, cried Amal.         
	According to the FIR, Arups brother-in-law Rabi Chowdhury called Sohinis father around 3am on Thursday to say that she had taken ill and was being admitted to a Garia nursing home. Amal panicked and dialled his son-in-law, who confirmed it.        
	As he neared the nursing home, Hindustan Health Point, Sohinis father spotted Arup and Rabi standing outside.        
	They escorted me to the house, which I was told belonged to Rabi Chowdhury, opposite the nursing home. My daughter was lying lifeless in one of the rooms. She was wearing a kurta I hadnt seen before. I instantly knew there was foul play, Amal said.        
	Sohinis father, a resident of Phoolbagan, filed an FIR with Kasba police station a few hours later, accusing his son-in-law and his family of murder.        
	Arup, mother Lily, sister Indira and brother-in-law Rabi were arrested under sections 498A (cruelty by husband or relatives), 406 (criminal breach of trust) and 304B (torture for dowry).        
	An Alipore court remanded Arup, an employee of a communications firm, in police custody till Monday. The rest will remain in judicial custody till June 26.        
	Anirban Guha Thakurta, the counsel for the accused, had argued for Indira and Rabi to be let off. They have been arrested just because the girl was taken to their house.         
	Sohinis father said he and his wife did not know Arup well but gave their consent to the marriage because they were in love.        
	Nita sensed something was wrong in the family within weeks of the marriage. Sohini told me that her mother-in-law would verbally abuse her, call her ugly and incapable of running the household, she said, choking on tears.        
	Arups family is from Chittagong, in Bangladesh. His father returned to their ancestral home after the wedding and mother Lily was to leave soon.

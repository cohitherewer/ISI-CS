	Pass the buck is the favourite pre-poll game in town  from graffiti on walls to a club of contention.        
	The latest buck in the game is a club at 47 Narkeldanga Main Road that both CPM and Trinamul Congress are keen to make their area base camp for electioneering. On March 29, rival supporters made a grab for the club.        
	Enter, Phoolbagan police station. But with the tug of war threatening to get ugly, the cops decided to play it safe.        
	Enter, the Election Commission. The cops alerted the returning officer of the area, who did not wish to get involved in what was viewed as a law and order matter.        
	Enter, Sealdah court. With the Election Commission remaining mum on the matter and refusing to do the polices job, taking legal recourse was the chosen course of cautious action.        
	Enter, lock and key. Before moving Sealdah court, the cops decided to take no chances, so they locked the club door and pocketed the keys. The court has demanded an explanation from the rival political parties and told the cops to keep the club keys in their custody till May 7 when the matter is heard.        
	We moved court because of the tension in the area and are now acting on court orders, said additional commissioner Banibrata Basu, on being asked why a local conflict over a club could not be tackled by the local police station.                                                        
	According to an officer of Phoolbagan police station, things would have spun out of control on Sunday afternoon had the cops tried to arrest rival supporters vying to take control of the club.        
	We have to play it safe in election time. Considering the gravity of the situation we informed the Election Commission. As a precautionary measure we locked up the club. And apprehending violence and breach of peace in the area, we moved Sealdah court, said the officer.        
	Some Phoolbagan residents caught in the crossfire were far from pleased. This is our club and we dont want any political party to take control of it or the police to lock it, they said.

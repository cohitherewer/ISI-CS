The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cops to fill in the blanks at booths
                                                                                                               Cops to fill in the blanks at booths
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	More than 100 polling centres in the city with over four booths each will have to make do with police constables at the gates rather than armed paramilitary personnel, officials said on Friday.        
	Only four paramilitary personnel will be available for one booth this year. Centres that have more than four booths will be difficult to manage with that kind of deployment. So the police have to step in, said an officer in Lalbazar.        
	The police agreed to take on the responsibility during a meeting with chief electoral officer Debashis Sen and home secretary Ardhendu Sen, though many doubted whether that was the best arrangement possible.        
	Is a city police constable the right substitute for a paramilitary soldier at the gate of any polling centre? asked an official at Writers Buildings.        
	The Election Commission has committed around 50 companies of paramilitary forces for the May 13 vote, which is almost 19 companies less than the deployment for the 2006 Assembly poll.        
	The chief electoral officer asked the police to focus on crowd management. They have been given the responsibility of ensuring that the queues do not become unmanageable. They have also been asked to immediately shunt out anyone who hangs around the centre after casting his/her vote, a source said.         
	Of the 788 polling centres, as many as 104 will have more than four booths.        
	The divisional police commissioners are required to submit route maps by Saturday for a flag march by central forces. Around 35 central companies will be in the city by Saturday and the full contingent by Sunday, an officer said.        
	Cellphone ban        
	Polling agents cannot carry cellphones to booths. Even voters will have to keep their cellphones switched off, an official overseeing poll security said.

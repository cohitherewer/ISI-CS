                      Portrait of old Calcutta                    Line drawings of cityscapes and old buildings in watercolours have now become the stuff of school history books. The series of sketches and watercolours of heritage buildings by master illustrator Samir Biswas, on view at the ongoing solo exhibition, are documents for posterity. Having witnessed the city of Calcutta as a participant observer from his youth, the artist became acutely sensitive to the process of change and transformation that the city was going through. His artistic activity is an expression of his attempt to capture and share the forgotten tales and legends that lie buried within every crack and crevice of the dwindling Victorian buildings of the city. Biswass images tell a telling tale of a metropolis under siege by forces of globalisation, such as the realty sharks and builders, big corporate houses and malls, that are destroying the history of the metropolis and its colonial soul. Besides celebrating the landscape and architecture of Calcutta and the variety and diversity it displays, this exhibition also draws attention to this rare and perhaps the toughest of all artistic genres by one of the best line drawing artists in the country.                    Event: An exhibition of sketches and watercolours by Samir Biswas When: Till June 8; 3 pm - 8 pm Where: Halo Heritage Art Gallery, 26 Ritchie Road, near Maddox Square Park

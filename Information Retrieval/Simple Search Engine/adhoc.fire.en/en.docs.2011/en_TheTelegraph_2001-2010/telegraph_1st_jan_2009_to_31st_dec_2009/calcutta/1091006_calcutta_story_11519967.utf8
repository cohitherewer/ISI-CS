The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | City centre feels heat of flare-up on fringes
                                                                                                               City centre feels heat of flare-up on fringes
          SUBHRO SAHA                                          
	The Vedic Village flare-up and the Kolkata Links fiasco can end up creating more pressure on the citys core areas, real estate players warn.        
	I dont feel price lines in Calcutta metropolitan areas will recede because of this ongoing land controversy and shelving of the IT project. If anything, cost of available plots will go up, since there arent too many parcels going in the heart of the city, feels Pradeep Sureka, the president of Credais state chapter.        
	Blame it on the domino effect of failed projects on the fringes like Kolkata Links, Jagadishpur and Dankuni. Land prices in and around the central business district (CBD) are high since theres a scarcity of actionable land parcels. If large townships are not created in tandem with the economic growth of the city, the CBD will become even more expensive, warns Abhijit Das of property consultants Lemongrass Advisors.        
	In most city core areas of Mumbai and Delhi, prevailing prices would be over Rs 100 crore an acre, and even more in prime residential neighbourhoods. Calcutta is yet to attain that high, for obvious reasons.        
	But in the past few years, real estate prices in Calcutta have scaled often unreal peaks thanks mainly to the auction of land parcels by government agencies like the CMDA and Calcutta Municipal Corporation, which has artificially jacked up the market, allege realtors.        
	The Fort group paid Rs 1 crore for a cottah near Golpark for the Bedi Bhavan plot, which works out to Rs 60 crore an acre. LIC clinched silver with a ticket size of Rs 55 crore an acre for a land parcel near Science City.        
	Both these deals shattered the earlier mark posted by Emaar-MGF Land, which had forked out Rs 213 crore for a 6.24-acre plot on the EM Bypass, where it proposed to bring two five-star hotels  JW Marriott and Holiday Inn.        
	Recently, South City Projects Ltd purchased two small land parcels in Sector V, coughing up nearly Rs 40 crore per acre and the Ideal Group paid Rs 85 crore for the 229-cottah Rasoi factory plot in New Alipore.        
	Some of these prices are not sustainable in the current context and has sent out wrong signals to landowners in the city, feel marketing agencies.        
	Most of these deals have only helped the owners of the land and speculators to make a windfall, says a selling agent.        
	Jitendra Khaitan of Pioneer Properties, who was involved in the Rasoi deal, feels this mad rush is inexplicable and advocates restraint going forward, in order to create a more sustainable real estate environment.        
	Market calculations say that the Fort Group, which is planning a high-end highrise condo complex on the Bedi Bhavan plot, will have spent around Rs 8,000 per sq ft on development, given the exorbitant cost of land.        
	At that rate, they will have to sell at Rs 12,000 to 13,000 per sq ft to make money, which is difficult to pull off in this low-energy market, observes a property broker. Developers only make money when the price of land and real estate is stable and affordable to a large number of people, he argues.        
	With none of the Bypass five-star hotels planned along that ITC corridor making any headway, the mad rush might be over.        
	But the political question mark over Rajarhat and its adjoining areas will force the spotlight back on the city core areas despite low FSI (floor space index) in and around the CBD. FSI or FAR (floor area ratio) is the ratio of the total floor area of buildings at a certain location to the size of the land at that location, or the limit imposed on such a ratio.        
	I dont see land prices in Calcutta metropolitan areas changing much in the next few years, says Pawan Agarwal of NK Realtors.

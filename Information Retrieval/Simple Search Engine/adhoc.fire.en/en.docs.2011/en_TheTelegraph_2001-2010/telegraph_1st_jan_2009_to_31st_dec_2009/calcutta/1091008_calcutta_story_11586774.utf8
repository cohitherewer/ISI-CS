The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Harass charge against CU tutor
                                                                                                               Harass charge against CU tutor
          MITA MUKHERJEE                              
	A senior teacher of Calcutta Universitys Institute of Agricultural Science has been accused of sexually harassing two women scholars, forcing them to quit research.        
	One of the scholars mentioned in her resignation letter, addressed to vice-chancellor Suranjan Das, that indecent gestures from her guide had forced her to discontinue her research.        
	The other scholar attributed her decision to unavoidable circumstances but university sources said she had verbally complained to the authorities about obscene advances made by the senior teacher in question.        
	Both scholars had been doing research under the teacher (Metro is withholding their names for reasons of propriety) in the agronomy department of the institute since 2007.        
	Their resignation letters were accepted on September 22, a day before the university closed down for the Puja vacation.        
	When contacted on Wednesday, the accused teacher  known to have CPM links  denied knowledge of the scholars resignation or the harassment charges they had levelled against him.        
	The scholar who formally lodged the sexual harassment charge wrote: He (the guide) is very ill-behaved and occasionally makes indecent gestures which are not at all acceptable to me as a lady student. I have tried a number of times to convey my uneasiness to him but in return I always get a sarcastic reply. I therefore think that the only way to get out of this difficult situation is to keep away from any sort of interaction with my guide and hence, I am putting in my papers.        
	She requested the vice-chancellor to cancel her registration for the PhD programme at the earliest.        
	Most women scholars of the university are up in arms against the authorities. We are stunned that they have accepted the resignations without conducting an inquiry into the allegations. The two scholars have put their career on the line by quitting. A sensitive administration should have immediately ordered a probe against the accused teacher, said a woman scholar at the universitys Ballygunge Science College.        
	Pro vice-chancellor Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee said: There is no question of ordering an inquiry as scholars are free to quit research at any stage. As for the guide, he is an efficient teacher and is heading a number of major research projects.

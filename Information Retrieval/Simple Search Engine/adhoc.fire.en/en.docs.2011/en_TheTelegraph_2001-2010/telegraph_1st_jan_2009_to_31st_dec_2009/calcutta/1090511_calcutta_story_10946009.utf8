The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Woman chases amp; collars teaser at Esplanade   Braveheart fights back
                                                                                                               Woman chases amp; collars teaser at Esplanade   Braveheart fights back
  - 30-year-old fights back after lewd gesture and urges all victims of harassment to do the same                                                
	Shreyasee Bhaduri, 30, had two choices when a stranger made a lewd gesture at her while she was walking down Esplanade on Sunday afternoon  ignore it like most women on the streets of Calcutta do, or confront him. She did one better by chasing the accused down a pavement, grabbing him by the collar and hauling him to a police station where harassment of a different kind awaited her.        
	But Shreyasee, a working woman who is also studying law, wouldnt back out without teaching her tormentor a lesson. She left the police station only after ensuring that the man, a 45-year-old Kidderpore resident identified as Sheikh Sagir, was arrested. I wish every woman who is teased... hits back every time, she said. Metro salutes the Behala girls spirit with a first-person account of her brave act.              
	It was around 1.30pm, the sun was beating down and there were few people on the streets. I was in a hurry to reach the office where I work part-time and was almost sprinting towards the Lenin Sarani crossing. Suddenly, I noticed a man coming from the opposite direction staring at me and then saying something unmentionable before making a vulgar gesture.        
	I stared back and shouted at him to stop. He was apparently taken aback by my angry reaction and started walking briskly along the pavement adjacent to the Metro channel. A railing between the pavement and the main road prevented me from getting to him. But I was not ready to let him get away. I ran several metres towards where the railing starts and took the pavement so that I could follow him.        
	By the time the man realised that I was after him, I had grabbed him by the collar. That was right in front of the traffic police kiosk next to the pavement. A couple of policemen stood there watching. I was shocked  how could they not react to what was happening in front of their eyes?        
	I discovered that the man was drunk  he was reeking of liquor  but that could not be an excuse for what he did. I told him to accompany me to the nearest police station but he refused. A crowd had gathered by then. When someone asked the man what the matter was, he replied that madam was creating a scene for nothing. For nothing! As I was wondering what to do next, the man started sprinting across the road. I ran after him again.                    
	A sergeant on the other side asked me who I was after. I shouted that he should stop the man in the dark trousers, which he fortunately did. After hearing my story, he asked me whether I would like to lodge a complaint. I nodded. The sergeant arranged for a vehicle to take us to Hare Street police station.        
	The attitude at the police station took me by surprise. As I sat on a bench, policemen passing by would stare at me and then ask the man: Ki reki korechhis tui? (Hey! what have you done).        
	I was given a piece of paper to write my complaint. After I finished, they asked for a photocopy. When I did not find a Xerox shop, they asked me to write the complaint again on another sheet.        
	I would have written the same thing 10 times if needed; so determined I was to get justice. An hour elapsed by the time they accepted my complaint and arrested the man.        
	I am no trend-setter but I wish every woman who is teased, abused or molested on the street, a bus or train hits back every time like I did.        
	 As told to Pronab Mondal

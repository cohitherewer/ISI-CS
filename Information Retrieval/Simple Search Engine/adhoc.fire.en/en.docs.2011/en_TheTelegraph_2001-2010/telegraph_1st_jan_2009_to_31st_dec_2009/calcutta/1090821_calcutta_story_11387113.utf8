The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Actress phone found, one held
                                                                                                               Actress phone found, one held
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The cellphones and part of the cash that actress Rituparna Sengupta had lost in a city hotel were recovered on Thursday following the arrest of a youth in Rabindranagar, South 24-Parganas.        
	Police said the accused, Sudip Singh, had been arrested earlier on a similar charge of lifting cellphones at hotels.        
	Rituparnas bag that went missing from a star hotel on Tuesday night had two cellphones and Rs 8,000.        
	One of the phones rang once on Wednesday morning after which it was switched off. We traced the phone to Rabindranagar and our men zeroed in on Singh as he had a history of stealing cellphones. He has admitted to the crime, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters). The cops also recovered the actresss bag but around Rs 5,000 was missing.        
	I thank the police commissioner and his department for taking such prompt action, said Rituparna.

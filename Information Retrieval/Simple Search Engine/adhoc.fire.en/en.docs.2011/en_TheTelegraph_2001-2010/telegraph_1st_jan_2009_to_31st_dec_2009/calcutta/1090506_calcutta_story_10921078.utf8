	The verdict of the apex court to cut off the water supply lines of defaulters of property tax is pragmatic and praiseworthy (Seal on water snap for default, March 17). It is disgraceful that a large number of well-off owners have ignored to pay property tax. Very often we, the common people, blame the civic body for failing to discharge its duties in various sections. If taxes of more than Rs 500 crore remain unpaid then public amenities are bound to suffer.           
	Snapping the water supply line may appear heartless to many but such opportunists cannot be allowed to enjoy benefits without doing their duties. However, the courts verdict should also be a reminder to the civic body to render services more diligently.

  Behala             In expansion mode: Victoria Memorial                   
	It was most disturbing to read the report Plea to build Victoria annexe, March 25. Green activists and anyone who is concerned for Calcutta must ensure that the beauty of Victoria Memorial is not spoilt. Such an annexe would be thronged by vendors and all sorts of undesirable elements that would destroy the lush green surroundings.             
	A.S. Mehta,
  New Alipore                     
	It is good to learn that the authorities of Victoria Memorial have sought the courts permission to set up a cultural complex on the premises. Given that Victoria Memorial attracts a huge number of visitors, those misusing the compound will now have to make themselves scarce.

	Apropos Why April is cruel and cloudless, April 22, Nature stands as the prime accused for the suffering this summer in Calcutta. But one cant help feeling guilty in blaming nature alone. A little more contribution from mankind in the form of preservation of greenery, maintenance of water bodies, conservation and proper generation of power as well as stringent anti-pollution measures would have probably helped us deal with the wrath of Nature better.             
	Jaya Ghosh,
  Dr Sarat Banerjee Road                     
	I am scared to think about the days after May 13, 2009. Thats because both the electricity and water supply departments, whose services have been over-stretched in the past few weeks, will probably curtail their services once the city finishes voting. Hence we must be brave and have patience till the rains come.           
	Biswajit Chattopadhyay,

	The report Bravehearts trek through forest (21 March) was extremely inspiring. The story of disabled persons taking part and winning prizes in the Beyond Belief Expedition Challenge was really something to cheer about. These success stories are illustrative of every individuals potential to prove his or her mettle.             
	While working at Tata Steel, I saw how tenaciously the then technical director  Dr Amit Chatterjee, a victim of multiple sclerosis who was bound to a wheelchair  worked his way to the top. Another IT professional based in Jamshedpur who had lost his hands would operate the computer with the help of his legs with remarkable efficiency.           
	Kolkata Sukriti Foundation deserves kudos for encouraging and facilitating endeavours like the Beyond Belief Expedition Challenge. Our society would be greatly benefited if more such organisations were encouraged by the government through sponsorships and other facilities.           
	P.B. Saha,
  Salt Lake                               
	Kudos to Raja Rammohan Roy Library Foundation for taking an initiative to link various public libraries across the country (Net link for public libraries, March 23). After the libraries are linked, readers wont have to visit a library to know if a book is available there; all such information will available at the click of a mouse. The organisation also deserves praise for starting work on creating a digital library. These facilities will be a boon for students, teachers and researchers.             
	Sourish Misra,

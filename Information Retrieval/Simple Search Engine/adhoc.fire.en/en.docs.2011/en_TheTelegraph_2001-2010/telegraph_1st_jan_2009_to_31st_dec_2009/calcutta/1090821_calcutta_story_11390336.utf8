The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cop code: flout it, park it, forget it
                                                                                                               Cop code: flout it, park it, forget it
          A STAFF REPORTER                                             
	Hawkers push them off the pavements and rows of illegally parked police vehicles render the pathway perilous.        
	Citizens have lost their right of way on RN Mukherjee Road in central Calcutta with the crossed P at every step signifying a no-parking sign for everyone but the cops.        
	They have turned this busy thoroughfare into a garage. You will see police vehicles parked here from morning till night. But if your vehicle is parked at the same spot, it will be towed away or clamped, said the owner of a computer parts store in the area.         
	Metro counted at least 90 police vehicles  prison vans, patrol cars, Ambassadors and a few motorcycles  along that stretch on Thursday afternoon.         
	Some of these vehicles partially stood on the pavements, from where hawkers have long elbowed out pedestrians.        
	The sole parking lot allotted by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation in that area can legally accommodate not more than 26 vehicles on a small stretch.        
	This is the polices fief. What can we do? But we dare not exceed our quota unless the cops come and ask us to find space for private vehicles belonging to people they know, said one of the parking attendants.         
	Around 5.15pm, the front tyre of a private Ambassador parked on the southern end of RN Mukherjee Road was clamped by a constable. When the driver argued that he had parked the car only because four other vehicles were already stationed there, the constable retorted: Dekchhis na? Oigulo police-er gaadi (Cant you see? Those are police vehicles).        
	The deputy commissioner of traffic, Dilip Bandopadhyay, said he was aware of police vehicles being parked in the area but was unsure whether those stretches were in fact no-parking zones.        
	I will have to check with my team if the police vehicles are being parked in no-parking zones. Nobody, including the cops, are above the law. Any violator of traffic norms must be booked under the specified clause of the Motor Vehicles Act, he added.        
	But who will police the police?        
	An officer deployed near the Mangoe Lane crossing argued that there was nothing he or anybody else could do in the absence of parking space in front of Lalbazar.        
	Police vehicles need to be parked near the headquarters for quick deployment, he explained.        
	Chittaranjan Bandopadhyay, a 58-year-old employee of a private company in Dalhousie, said it was a shame that the police were blatantly flouting rules while demanding that citizens follow them.        
	The hawkers took away our pavements and now police vehicles dont allow us any space on the road, he complained.

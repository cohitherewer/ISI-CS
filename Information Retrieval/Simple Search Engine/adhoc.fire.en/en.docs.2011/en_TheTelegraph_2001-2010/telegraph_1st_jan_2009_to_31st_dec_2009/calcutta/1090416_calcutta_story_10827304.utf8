The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Burglars hit trader home
                                                                                                               Burglars hit trader home
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A gang stole jewellery worth Rs 3 lakh and around Rs 50,000 in cash from a house in a busy Howrah locality on Poila Baisakh afternoon while the owner was performing puja in his factory.         
	Mrinal Das, 54, had been living alone at 9/11 Nandalal Chatterjee Lane for two-and-a-half-months since his wife and daughter moved to his in-laws. Around 9.35am on Wednesday, he left for his factory on Makardah Road.        
	He returned around 2.30pm and found the lock on the collapsible gate broken. Inside, the doors of the two rooms were ajar and things kept in the almirahs were lying outside.        
	The thieves took the jewellery and cash. I never imagined that robbers could break the lock and enter the house during the day in such a thickly populated area, said Mrinal.         
	A preliminary probe suggested that at least two thieves were involved. They scaled the boundary wall before breaking the lock on the main door.        
	Since the thieves approached the single-storey house from the back, no one could see them, said an investigator. Manoj Ghosal, who lives next door, said: We did not see or hear anything suspicious.        
	An officer of Shibpur police station said: The thieves clearly knew that Das would be at the factory and his wife and daughter wont be at home either. We are trying to find out who could have passed on the information to the gang.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Theft in airport dorm
                                                                                                               Theft in airport dorm
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A trader who spent a few hours at a Calcutta airport dormitory waiting for a flight has alleged that Rs 12,000 was stolen from his bag.        
	The 27-bed dormitory was unoccupied at the time, except for two close friends of the trader.        
	Passengers in transit, those arriving in the early hours and those scheduled to catch early flights, usually put up in the airport dormitories.        
	Mahendra Agarwal, Amit Agarwal and Krishna Garg, all traders from Siliguri, reached Calcutta airport from Bangkok on a Thai Airways flight around 2am on August 5.        
	Mahendra was to fly to Aizwal the next morning, while Krishna and Amit were scheduled to take a plane back home to Siliguri.        
	The three were taken to the general dormitory of the domestic terminal by the airport staff.         
	Mahendra went to the dormitory toilet soon after checking in and after returning was alerted by one of his friends that the chain of his bag was open.         
	With Rs 12,000 missing from his bag, Mahendra lodged a complaint with airport police station. The three were not sure whether anyone had sneaked into the dormitory while Mahendra was in the toilet.        
	Its difficult to understand how the cash went missing. It appears that the thief knew there was money in the bag. The complainant suspects that airport employees were involved in the theft. We are looking into the matter, said a senior officer of the airport police station.         
	No one has ever accused the staff at the dormitory of theft, said a senior airport official.        
	The cops have asked the trio if they had seen anyone hanging around the dormitory while checking in. The domestic terminal also has a 20-bed air-conditioned dormitory.        
	The international terminal has eight double-bed retiring rooms and the domestic terminal, 23.

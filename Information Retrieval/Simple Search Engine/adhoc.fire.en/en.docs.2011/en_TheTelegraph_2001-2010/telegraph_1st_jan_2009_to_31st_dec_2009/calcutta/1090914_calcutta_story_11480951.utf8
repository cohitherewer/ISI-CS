The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Shortage spike in butter price
                                                                                                               Shortage spike in butter price
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Mitali Mukherjee was shocked when her grocer demanded Rs 28 for a 100g packet of Amul butter at Maniktala Market. The MRP is Rs 21, but he asked for an extra Rs 7, said the angry homemaker.         
	The city has been facing an acute shortage of Amul butter for the past few months. Taking advantage of the demand-supply mismatch, retailers are charging more than the MRP printed on the packs.        
	At many markets like Maniktala, Lake Market, Tiretta Bazar and New Market, shopkeepers are hiking up the butter prices by more than 30 per cent.         
	I have only 35 100gm packets of Amul butter. Currently no shop in the market has any butter left. Given the shortage, people who are used to having butter shouldnt mind paying a little extra, said Tarak Sau, a bakery product seller in New Market.         
	Since Amul accounts for more than 95 per cent share in the citys butter market, the city is feeling the pinch dearly.         
	The chief general manager of Amul, R.S. Sodhi, told Metro from Ahmedabad that the company had asked its local staff to check if any retailer was selling butter at a premium taking advantage of the crisis.         
	Sodhi said the shortage was the fallout of the initially dry monsoon, which led to inadequate production of milk. Summer is anyway a lean season for milk production. This year the drought in the initial weeks of monsoon hiked up the prices of fodder. As a result, underfed cows could not produce adequate milk, he explained.         
	But the shortage wont last for long. We have increased our production, Sodhi added.        
	Another reason for the shortage of butter was the increased demand during the first quarter of the year, Sodhi pointed out. We exhausted our stocks, he admitted.        
	Though exact consumption figures for Calcutta are unavailable, sale figures at the retailer level give an indication of the extent of the shortage.        
	An Amul Parlour owner in central Calcutta said he used to sell 40 to 50 100g packets and 12 to 15 500g packets of butter daily. For the past two months I have not received a single 500g pack of butter and till last week, I received only 30 100g packets a week. Luckily I had picked up 1,000 packets of cholesterol-free butter a couple of months back. Even those are running out now, he said.        
	When Metro contacted Amuls Salt Lake office, an official said not a single pack of butter was left in their warehouses. Retailers at Amul Parlours and city markets are constantly inquiring about the supplies but we have run out of stock. We will inform our retailers as soon as fresh stocks arrive, said the official.        
	Shopkeepers said there was a shortage of Amul curd in the market too. Amul Masti Dahi has been in short supply since July-end, said a local employee of the company.

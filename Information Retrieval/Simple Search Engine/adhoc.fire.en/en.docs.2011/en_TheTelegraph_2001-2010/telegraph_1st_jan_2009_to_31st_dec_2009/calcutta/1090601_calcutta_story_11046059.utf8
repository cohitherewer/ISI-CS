          A STAFF REPORTER                          Nandita                                  
	A schoolgirl on a Sunday trip to her maternal uncles house was run over by a lorry after being flung out of the car she was in during a collision on Delhi Road.        
	Nandita Parekh, a 13-year-old student of Class VII at Carmel High School in Dhakuria, was with her parents in the rear seat when the accident occurred at Chakundi, near Dankuni, around 12.30pm.        
	Police said the lorry rammed the Ambassador from behind just when it was taking a left turn from the highway.         
	The Ambassadors rear left door opened on impact and Nandita and her mother Nikita, 40, fell out of the car. The truck ran over the girl before falling into a roadside ditch, said an officer at Dankuni police station.        
	Both Nandita and her mother were taken to Serampore Walsh Hospital, where the schoolgirl was declared dead on arrival. Nikita suffered a nose fracture.         
	The Parekhs, residents of Lake Gardens, were headed for Serampore, around 30km from the city.        
	Nanditas father Tilak is a manager in a paint factory at Dankuni. Family sources said he had hired the Ambassador from a travel agency on Camac Street and had planned to return to the city by night.

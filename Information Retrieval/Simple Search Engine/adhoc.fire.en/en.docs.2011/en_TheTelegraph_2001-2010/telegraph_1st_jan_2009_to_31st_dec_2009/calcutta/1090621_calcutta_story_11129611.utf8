The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Turnover talk
                                                                                                               Turnover talk
                              Sunil Vishnu                            
	The attempt to make theatre a lucrative career option is quite old, but it is only recently that groups are talking USP, turnover, public relations and global reach.         
	On June 13, when British Council (East India) hosted in Calcutta Indias first contest for the Young Performing Arts Entrepreneur 2009 Award, eight performing arts entrepreneurs from across the country were in the fray.         
	Apart from a trophy and a 10-day UK tour, the finalist is entitled to contest British Councils International Creative Entrepreneur Award in Edinburgh this August. Sunil Vishnu, a theatre professional from Chennai, was the chosen one.        
	The future of Evam is Disney. Its not a theatre company as Disney is not just a film company. It is a private limited company that does public shows, corporate workshops, festival management and we also have a theatre merchandise company, Muchos. From a seed capital of Rs 2 lakh, we are looking at an annual turnover of Rs 3.5 crore, said Vishnu, who along with Kartick Kumar, founded Evam the Happy Factory in 2003.         
	Evam operates in Chennai, Bangalore and Hyderabad and will soon extend to Pune and Coimbatore. We have proved that theatre can earn money, said Vishnu.         
	Evam has a repertoire of 17 plays, all of which were successful. The other contenders were Pawan Kumar BP of Actor Productions, Bangalore, Jehan-Sam D. Manekshaw of Theatre Professionals Private Limited and Sachin Kamani of The Company Theatre, Mumbai. In dance, there were Calcuttas Vikram Iyengar, the founder of Ranan Performance Collective, Paramita Saha, co-director, Sapphire Creations, and Anand Majumdar, the founder of Quickstep Salsa dance institute in Mumbai. Santosh Kumar, the creator of the website beatscampus.com, was there too.        
	There is no dearth of artistes and people with passion, but passion alone isnt enough. Performers have to discover plans to generate funds for themselves. We were looking for someone with a viable economic model, said film and stage director Suman Mukhopadhyay, who was part of the judges panel with danseuse Priti Patel, Anjan Raichaudhuri from IIM Calcutta and Adam Pushkin, the head of British Councils Arts and Creative Industries in India and Sri Lanka.                           SEBANTI SARKAR

	Two men died and one was seriously injured in two accidents on the northern fringes on Monday afternoon.         
	Suraj Kuri, a 22-year-old motorcyclist, was run over by a truck on Kalyani Expressway around 1pm. The man riding pillion, who could not be identified, was injured. The two were not wearing helmets, said a cop. They were taken to BN Bose Hospital.        
	Witnesses told the police that Kuri had lost control of the bike while negotiating a pothole.         
	In the other mishap, the 21-year-old help of a Barasat-bound WBSTC bus being run by a private party, was run over by the vehicles near the airport. Pronab Bairagi was standing on the footboard, said the police.        
	The bus driver, Subrata Dhar, was arrested and the vehicle impounded.

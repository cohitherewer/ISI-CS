										      The Telegraph - True Spirit Puja                      Lake Town Adhibasibrinda                                            
	Dum Dum Park        
	Masterda Smriti Sangha in Kestopur may not match the best in terms of safety arrangements but the club has brought smiles to some faces after a long time. Nearly 20 Aila-affected families from Simulhati village in Sandeshkhali are being hosted by the club this Puja. The organisers plan to take them pandal-hopping on Navami.        
	We used to organise five-six pujas in our village. But this year, not a single one is being organised, said Bimal Sardar, one of the affected villagers.         
	The arrangements at most pujas in Lake Town and Dum Dum Park are satisfactory. Dumdum Park Bharat Chakra is the pick of the lot with very good fire-safety measures. The organisers have arranged for a 200ft-long pipe to draw water from an adjacent pond in case of a fire. The toilets are clean and emergency numbers clearly displayed. There are arrangements for drinking water and an enclosure for treating the sick. The pandal offers wheelchair-bound people easy access.        
	Neighbouring Dumdum Park Tarun Sangha has also built a ramp for the physically-challenged. There are four pumps and long pipes to draw water from an adjacent pond to douse flames. Dumdum Park 4 Tank Yubak Brinda is another puja in the area with proper fire-fighting measures. The pandal has been divided into four zones, each with a fire alarm. We can quickly detect where a fire has started from the alarm that goes off, said an organiser.        
	Netaji Sporting Club has an air-conditioned room to treat the sick. Most of the pujas managed to avoid using plastic items.         
	Pragati Pally Adhibasibrinda in Lake Town left a lot to be desired.                     Bosepukur Talbagan                  
	New Alipore-Barisha        
	Two first-time entrants in True Spirit Puja were a study in contrast. Barisha Tarun Tirtha has conformed to the guidelines, with fire retardants sprayed on the cane, jute and hay pandal. A fire services officer manned the arrangements and electrical wiring is neat. The pandal is spacious and has waste bins. The organisers have tied-up with a local hospital and kept an ambulance at hand.        
	Sakuntala Park Ever Green, another debutant, is promoting AIDS awareness and blood donation, but has not bothered about the narrow pandal entrance, non-existent fire-fighting measures and unusable toilets. The organisers have, however, distributed clothes to children of dhakis.        
	The Acharya Prafulla Sangha pandal has been decorated by local kids, who have painted their dreams of playing football with Ma Durga and demanding ice-cream from her. The medicines in their first-aid box, however, had passed the use-by date.        
	Suruchi Sangha has paid attention to conserving greenery but not on waste management.        
	Agamani had no provision for drinking water, toilets or first-aid. The organisers blamed waterlogging in the area for their problems.                     Brindaban Matri Mandir            
	Kasba-Hindusthan Park        
	Few Kasba organisers seemed committed to making their puja safe and meaningful though many scored over pujas in other parts in terms of aesthetics. Then there were some who made an earnest effort to make the most of their resources and even went beyond the guidelines to embody the true spirit of the pujas. CCTVs seemed to be a fixture at most pandals.        
	Last years Three Star puja, Kalitala Sporting Club, manages to live up to the True Spirit ideals once again with adequate fire-safety measures, including a spade and a cutter. Electrical wiring inside the pandal, built on the lines of Madurais Meenakshi Temple, is neat.        
	Purbachal Sarbojanin has a well-stocked first-aid counter, a stretcher and a wheelchair inside its no-frills pandal.        
	Rajdanga East Recreation Club and Rajdanga Tribarna Sangha disappoint with their lack of attention to waste disposal, fire prevention and first-aid facilities. Rajdanga Naba Uday Sangha is a pretty sight with idols sitting amid webs spun out of colourful threads. There are smoke and heat detectors, fire alarms and drinking water and first-aid facilities in the pandal.         
	Bosepukur Sitala Mandir, one of the biggest draws, depicts Durga as a yogini. The metal and polycarbonate sheets used in the pandal reduce the chance of fire but toilet and first-aid facilities are inadequate.                     Barisha Youth Club            
	Maniktala        
	Stylised idols, elaborate pandals, good traffic management and adequate fire-safety measures characterise pujas in the area.         
	Last years Five Star puja, Manicktalla Chaltabagan Lohapatty has pulled out all stops this year too, with a prominent route map, seven CCTV cameras, a well-equipped medical centre and eight fire extinguishers. For the aged and the disabled, there is a wheelchair and a separate entrance. Solar energy meets 80 per cent of the power requirements, while LED lamps conserve electricity. The puja used last years prize money to sponsor the education of five needy students.        
	Madhubani paintings decorate the passage to Ram Mohan Smriti Sanghas pandal, created using lead-free paint by artisans from Bihar. Though located in a narrow lane, the space between the pandal and the houses allow for emergency exit. Rammohan Roy Road showcases crafts practised by self-help groups from seven districts.         
	The Brindaban Matri Mandir pandal on Sukeas Street is constructed two feet above ground as a safeguard against waterlogging. It is decorated with bamboo and applique work on patas. With 16 fire extinguishers and a spacious pandal, it combines aesthetics with safety.        
	Nalin Sarkar Street Sarbojanin follows most True Spirit guidelines but loses marks for using lead-based paint on the idols and poor helpdesk and drinking water arrangement.        
	Lalabagan Yubak Brinda (Nabankur Sangha), with a return to childhood theme, loses out because of the excessive use of plastic dolls.         
	The themes seemed to be the problems of Nabin Pally Sarbojanin (Hatibagan Nabin Pally) and Sammilita Lalabagan Sarbojanin, while 1 Pally Nikashipara Sarbojanin Durgotsav Samity made a mockery of the True Spirit guidelines.                    Ajeya Sanghati            
	Haridebpur        
	Following the norms to the letter, 41 Pally Club has a well-equipped first-aid corner, a separate gate for the elderly and the physically challenged, fire extinguishers and a generator. The organisers have even booked beds in hospitals for an emergency.         
	Putiyari Sarbojanin, with dandiya as its theme, provides proper fire, drinking water and toilet facilities. The club, which received Three Stars last year, used the prize money to treat two thalassaemia patients and organise eye and blood donation camps.        
	Ajeya Sanghati has six exits and three CCTV cameras to manage crowds. But toilet facilities for women are not up to the mark.        
	Pragati Sanghas pandal is modelled on a thatched hut. A specially carved pond will double as a source of water in case of a fire. The puja has a well-equipped first-aid counter, clean toilets and two wheelchairs for the disabled.        
	Vivekananda Park Athletic Club, in keeping with its rural theme, has grown vegetables on a patch of land on the premises. It is one of the few pujas providing parking space to visitors.         
	Nashkar Para Pally Unnanyan Samity did not have volunteers to manage the jostling crowds. Haridebpur Nabin Sathi Club had stocked medicines that had passed their use-by date.

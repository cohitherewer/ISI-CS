The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Great wall of Calcutta
                                                                                                               Great wall of Calcutta
  - United colours of politics  leaders of all hues claim defacement   is a trivial matter. But do you want your wall to look like this?					 					      TT for City - Graffiti Battle                      Two days after the Election Commission bowed to political pressure and gave the go-ahead for use of ldquo;easily removable rdquo; material for graffiti, Metro painted a Sealdah wall with three political colours. Only washable water colours were used. A coloured powder was dissolved in water the night before and used without any adhesive (the trade secret of everlasting poll graffiti). Metro will wipe and wash the wall clean within 24 hours. The graffiti was done to demonstrate how your walls can be defaced, by the book, if you give permission to any political party.

	RABIN DEB (CPM)        
	The strongman cant comprehend why such a fuss is being made over wall graffiti. Remind him of an individuals right to keep his walls clean and Deb, tipped to take on Mamata Banerjee in South Calcutta, goes on the offensive. Why focus on the effect rather than the cause? If there is no poverty, hunger, imperialism, fundamentalism and terrorism, there would be no need for the most popular form of political expression.        
	What about the Election Commissions order not to write graffiti on a wall without consent? We havent been told clearly about this yet. Let the commission inform us first; we will take things from there, says Deb.        
	He rubbishes allegations about the ruling party intimidating houseowners who refuse permission. There will be no intimidation.        
	What if the Election Commission ever imposes a blanket ban on graffiti and the parties reach a consensus? We will, under all circumstances, abide by the Election Commissions order and the Constitution. If there is a consensus among parties against graffiti, we will abide by that, too.              
	PARTHO CHATTERJEE (Trinamul Congress)        
	The leader of the Opposition thinks defacing someones wall to campaign for votes is a trivial matter. Before asking questions on matters as trivial as the houseowners consent for graffiti, why dont you raise your voice against hoardings everywhere? Dont they create visual pollution? Why raise such a hue and cry over political graffiti? he demands.        
	Chatterjee lashes out at the Election Commission helpline for wronged houseowners. This is a conspiracy to stifle the Oppositions campaign and help the ruling CPM. People might refuse to give us permission (to use their walls) but wont refuse the CPM out of fear, he says.        
	Why graffiti? Graffiti is the easiest, cheapest way of reaching out to people. The poll panel wants us to stay within the limits of campaign spending but is imposing rules that amount to pressuring us to go for expensive advertising.              
	PRADIP BHATTACHARYA (Congress)        
	The working president of the Congress state unit seems least bothered. Whenever houseowners complain to the police, we will whitewash their walls and find other walls, he chuckles. Why is everyone so concerned about so trivial an issue? wonders Bhattacharya.

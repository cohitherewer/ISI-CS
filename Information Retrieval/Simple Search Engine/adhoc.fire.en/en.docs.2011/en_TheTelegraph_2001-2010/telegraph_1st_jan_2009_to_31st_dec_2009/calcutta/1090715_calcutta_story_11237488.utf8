The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CMC move to raze blaze floor
                                                                                                               CMC move to raze blaze floor
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Nandaram Market has no choice but to abide by the recommendation of Jadavpur Universitys civil engineering department that the top six floors of the 12-storey building be demolished, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation said on Tuesday.        
	I have been asked by the municipal commissioner to ask the stakeholders to demolish the top six floors. If they dont do it, the CMC will be forced to send its team to do the job, director-general (buildings) Gora Chand Mondol said a day after Jadavpur University submitted its report to the civic body.         
	The decision to issue a notice to the Nandaram Market Disaster Management Welfare Committee was taken even as the 300-odd traders who operate out of the top six floors warned of stiff resistance to any such move.         
	We will stall any attempt to pull down the top six floors. It is a question of sustenance for over 300 families, said Samar Chowdhury, the general secretary of the welfare committee.

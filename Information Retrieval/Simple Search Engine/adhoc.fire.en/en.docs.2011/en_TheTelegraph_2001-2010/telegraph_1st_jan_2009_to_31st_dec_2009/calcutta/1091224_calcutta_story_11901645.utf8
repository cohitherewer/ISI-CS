The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fairground full of faults
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Fairground full of faults
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Milon Mela on Wednesday afternoon. (Sanat Kumar Sinha)                                  
	Milon Mela looked more like a battleground than a permanent fairground on Wednesday evening, less than 24 hours before the chief minister and the Union finance minister were to inaugurate the first big fair of the season there.        
	The main road into the venue of the Industrial India Trade Fair could not be made out under a thick layer of dust. The approach roads to the stalls were non-existent with deep crevices and craters on the ground that are unlikely to be filled up overnight.         
	There were no sprinklers in sight to settle the dust but given the condition of the ground, puddles could make the fair off limits for visitors.        
	There is no arrangement for drinking water and we had to even hire transformers for power supply, said an official of the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industries, which is organising the fair with the state government.         
	Representatives of seven countries, including China, Egypt, Turkey and Vietnam, are slated to participate in the fair along with leading public and private sector infrastructure, technology and services companies from India.         
	The state government is charging Rs 20 lakh more than last year as rent. The ground is not really ready though the government is saying so, said a senior chamber official.

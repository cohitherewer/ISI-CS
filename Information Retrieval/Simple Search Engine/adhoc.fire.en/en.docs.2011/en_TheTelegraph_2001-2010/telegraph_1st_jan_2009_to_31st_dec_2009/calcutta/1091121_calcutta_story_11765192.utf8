	Low-cost airline AirAsia on Friday launched a daily flight between Calcutta and Kuala Lumpur and is planning to start flights to several destinations in Thailand.        
	Next year we are planning to launch flights from Calcutta to Bangkok and Phuket, said Kathleen Tan, the regional head (commercial) of AirAsia.        
	The Kuala Lumpur-based airline has nine hubs in south-east Asia, including Bangkok and Phuket.        
	Tan also said that AirAsia could increase the frequency of its Calcutta-Kuala Lumpur service if the passenger load was satisfactory. If there is good passenger turnout, we can start double daily flights between the two cities, she said.        
	On its inaugural flight on Friday, 148 passengers arrived in Calcutta while 138 passengers boarded the flight for Kuala Lumpur. Airline officials said 30,000 tickets had been sold for flights from Calcutta.

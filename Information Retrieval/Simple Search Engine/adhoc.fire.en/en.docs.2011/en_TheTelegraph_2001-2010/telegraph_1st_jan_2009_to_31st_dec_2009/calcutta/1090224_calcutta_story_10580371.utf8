The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Girls run over at level crossing
                                                                                                               Girls run over at level crossing
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two teenagers were run over by a local train at a level crossing in Kamardanga, Howrah, on Monday afternoon while returning home after inviting a friend to a Shivratri programme in their locality.        
	Purnima Malik, a 13-year-old resident of Kamardanga, and Priyanka Das, a 15-year-old resident of Sumai Chanditala in Ichhapur, were dragged 30ft from the level crossing by a Kharagpur local. Purnima and Priyanka studied in Class VII and Class VIII of Ichhapur Girls High school.        
	The gate of the level crossing was closed but they managed to sneak through a small passage and headed to the other side. They did not hear the approaching train as a loudspeaker was blaring at a nearby Shivratri programme. The gateman screamed out that trains were approaching from both directions. They tried to get back but it was too late, said Rabin Roy, a resident of the area who witnessed the mishap.        
	Family members of the girls said they were to attend a physical training class in school but left for a common friends house near the tracks as the trainer did not turn up. The girls wanted to invite their friend to a cultural programme organised by a local club on Monday evening.

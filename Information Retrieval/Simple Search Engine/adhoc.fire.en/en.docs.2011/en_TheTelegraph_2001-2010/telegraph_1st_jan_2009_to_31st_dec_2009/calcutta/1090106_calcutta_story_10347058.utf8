The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fog, collision hit Delhi trains
                                                                                                               Fog, collision hit Delhi trains
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Trains will be disrupted on the Calcutta-Delhi route for the next few days owing to fog in north India and the Sunday morning collision between two goods trains near Kanpur.        
	Three trains were cancelled on Monday and six rescheduled because of the twin problems, said an Eastern Railway official. The trains that collided were removed from the tracks but it will take time to clear the backlog, especially with dense fog in north India.        
	On Monday, the Sealdah Rajdhani reached the city 16 hours late. The Howrah Rajdhani, which had started from Delhi seven hours late because of fog and was diverted following the collision, arrived at 2.30pm on Monday instead on 9.55am on Sunday.        
	The Poorva Express reached Howrah 34 hours late while the Kalka Mail was almost 16 hours behind schedule. The Jodhpur Express was delayed by 19 hours.        
	We took steps to provide food to the passengers of the Rajdhanis that were running late, said a railway official.        
	The Sealdah Rajdhani Express, West Bengal Sampark Kranti Express and the Kalka Mail were cancelled on Monday.         
	The Howrah-Delhi Superfast Express on Tuesday evening was also cancelled.        
	Fog has forced the authorities to short-terminate the Howrah-Delhi Janta Express at Mughalsarai. The Howrah-Amritsar Express will also be short-terminated at Mughalsarai till January 31.

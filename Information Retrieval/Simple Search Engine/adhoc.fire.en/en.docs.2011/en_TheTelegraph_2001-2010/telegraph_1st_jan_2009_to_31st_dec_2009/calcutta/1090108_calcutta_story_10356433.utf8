          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	After Bhowanipore Education Society College, its Surendranath Colleges turn to come under the scanner for admitting students in excess of the sanctioned capacity.        
	An inspection team from Calcutta University visited Surendranath College recently and found the number of students in at least four departments more than what the rules permit. According to the inspection report, which was placed before the undergraduate council on Wednesday, the college has exceeded the intake limit in the English, Bengali, Sanskrit and geography departments.        
	A source said 192 students were admitted to the Bengali honours course this year against the sanctioned limit of 50. In the English department, the number of first-year students is 220, more than five times its quota of 40.         
	The college has more than 80 students in excess of the approved quota in the geography department.        
	The university fixes admission limits for colleges on the basis of infrastructure and faculty strength.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Commuter hassle in clog corridor
                                                                                                               Commuter hassle in clog corridor
                                          
	Traffic crawls on the stretch of Jessore Road between Belgachhia Metro station and Nagerbazar, especially during rush hours. Metro checks out why commuters are held up for hours              
	Construction hurdle        
	Trucks carrying building materials for residential projects coming up between Bangur Avenue and Lake Town are a major cause of traffic chaos. Goods carriages parked on the stretch between the Kalindi crossing and Bangur further narrow the road width.         
	Even under normal circumstances, trucks severely hamper traffic. The situation has become impossible after the roads were dug up to lay sewage lines and build the Nagerbazar flyover, said Digvijay Singh Deo, a 28-year-old Kalindi resident.              
	Wheel deal        
	Buses on routes 221, 223, 215 and DN8 slow down and turn very slowly at the Lake Town and Nagerbazar junctions, holding up traffic.        
	Rickshaws, cycle-vans and other slow-moving vehicles add to the chaos on the thoroughfare.              
	Pavement peeve        
	Makeshift temples, shanties, garbage vats, stacks of sand, sacks of cement, parked cycle-rickshaws and autos  there are encroachments every couple of feet on the footpaths between Belgachhia Metro station and Nagerbazar. Pedestrians are left with no option but to share the thoroughfare with trucks, buses, autorickshaws and cars.        
	Because of the condition of the pavements, many pedestrians prefer to walk on the road, slowing down traffic. You cant really blame them, said Noor Islam, who owns a shop at the Satgachhi crossing.        
	The footpaths near Nagerbazar have been taken over by hawkers and greengrocers.              
	Underpass bottleneck        
	The four-lane Jessore Road narrows to half its width at the two underpasses near Patipukur. Hence, snarls are common throughout the day.        
	Making matters worse, the area was dug up before last Puja to lay sewage pipes. The work is still months away from completion.         
	For those who commute via Belgachhia Metro station, the last six months have been a nightmare. Most residents now take the much longer route via VIP Road and Ultadanga to take the Metro from Shovabazar-Sutanuti station, said Sudhin Laha, a 55-year-old advocate living in Borat.        
	Patients are delayed near the underpasses on their way to RG Kar hospital.        
	Sometimes, passengers get off the bus at Patipukur and walk to Belgachhia Metro station, said Namrita Gill, a 24-year-old HR professional who takes the route.              
	Official word        
	A senior official of the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) said: The work is part of the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project. It had to be halted temporarily after partial completion and redone. That took more time than it should have. Once the work is completed, the underpasses would be in a much better condition. Waterlogging will be reduced by at least 70 per cent.        
	He added: The footpaths are in a shambles because material used for relaying the pipes are being dumped there.         
	The police blamed the traffic problems on the condition of the road. If the state of the road improves between Belgachhia Metro station and Nagerbazar, the traffic situation will automatically improve, a senior officer told Metro.

                                                                                                               Extortionist, aide in police net
          A STAFF REPORTER                           Santosh Rai at Lalbazar. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Santosh Rai, most wanted in Orissa, Bihar and Jharkhand in connection with extortion, murder and dacoity cases, was arrested at Colootolla on Thursday afternoon.        
	His associate Farid Khan, who stole cars that were used in the operations, was also arrested in the raid on a hideout in Phears Lane.        
	Rai was planning to gun down Javed, a car dealer in Beniapukur Lane, who refused to cough up Rs 3 lakh. The accused had tried to extort the money from the trader in January, said detective chief Jawed Shamim.        
	Rai, in his mid-30s, and his gang members allegedly abducted and murdered Keonjhar-based businessman Rashmi Ranjan Mahapatra and his driver in Ranchi after collecting a ransom of Rs 80 lakh in May 2007. The gang took the two to Roorgaon, a village near Ranchi, murdered them, tied their bodies to a cot and set them on fire.        
	Rai kept eluding the cops though three of his aides  Taslim, Arsad and Rajesh  had been arrested. Rai has worked as a contract killer in Bihar and Jharkhand. For the past few weeks, he was holed up in Jamtara in Jharkhand. At least 15 cases of extortion and criminal intimidation are lodged against him in the state. In Calcutta, an extortion case was lodged against Rai with Alipore police station, said an officer of the detective department.        
	Rai spent his childhood in Chetla. Later, he came in contact with Howrah-based gangster Dudhwa who introduced him to a ganglord in Orissa.        
	The cops claimed Rai carried a 9mm revolver with him and was an excellent shooter.         
	After the Mahapatra murder, Rai kept shifting base between Jharkhand and Bihar, extorting businessman and mine owners. He gunned down a few traders who had refused to pay him. We are getting in touch with police from other states to find out more about Rai. A police team from Orissa is on the way to the city to interrogate him, added the officer.

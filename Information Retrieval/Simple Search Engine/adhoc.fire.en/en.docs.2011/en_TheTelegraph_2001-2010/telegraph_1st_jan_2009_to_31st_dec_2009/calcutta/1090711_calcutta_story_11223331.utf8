          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A woman was arrested and another detained on Friday after their husbands committed suicide.        
	Munni Begum, 27, was arrested for allegedly abetting Mohammad Mushtaques suicide at their Ekbalpore home on July 5. The 30-year-old, who had consumed poison, died on Thursday. Mushtaques family had accused Munni of demanding money from him and mentally torturing him. Mushtaque had recently lost his job with a private bank.        
	Manju Chakraborty was detained after her husband Prosenjit, 22, was found hanging in their Roy Bahadur Road house on Friday.        
	Phone link: Most of the telephones affected in Tuesdays fire at Circus Exchange remained out of order on Friday. Telephone connection has been restored to about 30,000 customers.        
	Doctor registration: The high court on Friday directed the Medical Council of India to register within six months a woman who had completed her MBBS in Nepal. Baishali Hom Chowdhury, daughter of well-known city doctors Ramendu and Bandana Hom Chowdhury, had applied to the council for registration last year but was refused because she had got less than 50 per cent in physics, chemistry and mathematics in the HS.        
	Girl death: A 12-year-old girl who worked as a help in a Barisha house was found hanging on Friday. Cops said Baisakhi Pradhan was a resident of Khejuri in East Midnapore. Her father Sahadeb has lodged a police complaint against her employer.         
	Market work: The high court on Friday appointed advocate Kallol Basu as a special officer to inspect the expansion work of BJ Market in Salt Lake and file a report. The order followed a petition by residents of the block alleging that during the work, Bidhannagar Municipality had encroached on the market pavements.

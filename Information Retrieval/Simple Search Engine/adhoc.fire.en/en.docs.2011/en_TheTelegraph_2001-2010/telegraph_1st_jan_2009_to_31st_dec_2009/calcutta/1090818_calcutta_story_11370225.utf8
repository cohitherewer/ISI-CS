The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pedestrians lose right to pavement
                                                                                                               Pedestrians lose right to pavement
          OUR BUREAU                           Nothing has changed on the stretch of the Bentinck Street pavement where Biswajit Biswas was punched and kicked by hawkers on July 15. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                  
	1996: The Calcutta Municipal Corporation launches Operation Sunshine, the first sustained campaign to clear some of the citys crowded pavements of hawkers         
	2006: The sun goes down on Operation Sunshine with the Calcutta Municipal Corporation deciding to allow hawkers on all pavements, subject to amended rules        
	2009: Hawkers are not only back for good, they are here to rule               
	Pedestrians suffer the most in Calcuttas perennial traffic chaos because they are the only ones not to have any space to call their own.        
	When 41-year-old Biswajit Biswas dared to protest the hawker monopoly on Bentinck Street last month, he was bullied and beaten up. Thousands of other pedestrians silently sidestep the hawker menace every day lest they meet the same fate.        
	The invasion of pavements is complete. No amount of force can evict them now. As for me, I try to avoid falling on the rows of gas stoves that greet me each time I step out of Park Street Metro station, said bank official Sunil Dey.        
	So does that mean there is no law to protect the pedestrian who wants to walk down the only place along a street that is legally his or hers?        
	According to the Calcutta Municipal Corporations rulebook, hawkers are allowed to occupy only one-third of a pavement, and that area must be at least 50 metres from the nearest crossing. But the majority of the 2.5 lakh hawkers flout these norms with the civic body, police and political parties blessings.        
	We have had meetings with police bosses in the presence of leaders of all hawkers unions. We have told the hawkers that they cannot overrun the pavements, said Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya.         
	But he had no answer to why no action had been taken so far.        
	A sergeant said the hawker-police-politician nexus was too strong to be broken. The occasional eviction campaigns are just for show.         
	Metro surveyed three of the thoroughfares in town where the only raj now is hawker raj.        
	Park Street         
	From lassi to spaghetti, the citys food street has something for everyone. But if you are a pedestrian, beware of hawkers.        
	The dominance of hawkers begins from outside the Metro station, where they have occupied almost the entire space available. Commuters stepping out of the station are allowed a barely two-feet passage to walk through and reach the main street.         
	This bottleneck at the entrance and exit of the Metro station inconveniences people throughout the day. Even if one manages to wriggle out of the passage, there is no escaping the hawker menace along the entire stretch of the pavement till Russell Street.         
	Police personnel are stationed barely 100 metres from the Metro entrance but they are apparently there only to watch.

	The stretch between the Park Street-AJC Bose Road crossing and the Elliot Road-AJC Bose Road crossing is a favourite with car owners and drivers looking for cheap spares and repairs, but the pedestrian gets a raw deal.        
	At least 30 shops dealing in everything from fancy car accessories to tyres illegally occupy the stretch. Mechanics carry out repairs on the main road and use the pavement to stock goods.         
	The main road is the only place where one can walk. Nobody dare protest because these mechanics are known to assault anyone who does so, said a nun waiting for a bus in the middle of the road.         
	Exide crossing         
	Hawkers have made the narrow pavement here narrower. Both sides of the road (one leading to Elgin Road and the other to Nizam Palace) have been taken over by hawkers selling everything from clothes and food to cosmetics and newspapers. It is a nightmare getting to the Metro station. Commuters have to elbow their way inside, said Mitali Mukherjee, on her way to Shakhawat Memorial to escort her daughter back home.

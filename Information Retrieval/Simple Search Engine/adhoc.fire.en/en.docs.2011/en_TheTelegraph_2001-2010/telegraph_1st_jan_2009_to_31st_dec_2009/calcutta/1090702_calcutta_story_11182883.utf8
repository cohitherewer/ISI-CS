The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cover-up slur on cops
                                                                                                               Cover-up slur on cops
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Residents of the Howrah locality where robbers looted an apartment and strangled its owner on Tuesday have defended the only suspect to be arrested: a building guard.         
	They (police) have framed him to cover up their failure to arrest the real culprits. Howrah has become lawless because the police have allowed criminals a free run, said a neighbour of Kalicharan Gupta, the 42-year-old trader who was throttled in front of his wife after the robbery.        
	Investigators said Omprakash Jaiswal, one of the two guards at Hari Niketan on Dobson Road, was arrested because of his contradictory statements about the disappearance of his colleague Rambharose Singh. But residents said Rambharose possibly panicked and fled after the police detained Omprakash.        
	Howrah police chief Niraj Kumar Singh said the four armed men who barged into Guptas second-floor flat and killed him after emptying the almirahs of cash and jewellery were probably extortionists who had contacted him earlier. Police teams are being formed to launch a crackdown on extortionists active in Radhabazar, where Gupta owned a watch shop.        
	The gang had tied up and gagged Gupta, his wife and their two maids before prising open the almirahs in the bedrooms. Investigators suspect the robbers strangled the trader with a torn bedsheet after learning that he had recognised them.        
	The gang walked out of the apartment moments later dressed in the slain traders clothes. They left their blood-stained attire behind.        
	An officer said the robbers clothes would be the clinching evidence once they were arrested.

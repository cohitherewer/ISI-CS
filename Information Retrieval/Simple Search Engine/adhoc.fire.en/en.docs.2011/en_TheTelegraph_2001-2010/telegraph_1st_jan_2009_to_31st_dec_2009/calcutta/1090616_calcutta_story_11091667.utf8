                                                                                                               Phone plan complaint
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The state consumers affairs department has complained to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India about Calcutta Telephones introducing a monthly rent for a cellphone plan originally advertised as zero-rental.        
	The department wrote to the authority after receiving complaints about change in the terms of the Manikjod scheme, said P. Mukherjee, the director of the department. Calcutta Telephone officials refused comment.

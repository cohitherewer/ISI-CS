The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 15-day bonus for old bus
                                                                                                               15-day bonus for old bus
  - Govt blinks yet again while operators go on the offensive          OUR BUREAU                                          
	The government has granted a 15-day reprieve to the foul fume brigade, raising the transport lobbys hopes of being pampered with yet another round of extensions and concessions.        
	Transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury said on Monday that owners failing to apply for replacement of their old buses by October 31 would get 15 days to reply to a show-cause notice.        
	The government had on October 7 set the deadline for submitting applications to get buses more than 15 years old replaced with new ones.        
	Metro had reported on Friday that Chowdhurys department was drafting the show-cause notice for those who would fail to meet the deadline.        
	The defaulters will be show-caused. They will have to reply within 15 days. The government will consider the cases of those who are facing genuine problems, the secretary said on Monday.        
	With just five days to go for the deadline, the transport department has received applications for around 1,000 of the 3,067 buses and minibuses.        
	Asked why the extra time would be granted to defaulters, Chowdhury said: Many might be willing to get their vehicles replaced but have not been able to apply yet because of financial or other genuine constraints. The leeway will ensure that such operators are not left out.        
	However, on October 7, transport minister Ranajit Kundu had ruled out any extension of the deadline or consideration for those who would fail to meet it.        
	The operators are of course on the front foot. The government isnt doing us a favour by offering the extra fortnight. It shouldnt have, in the first place, imposed such a deadline while the matter was sub judice. Mark my words, there will be many more such extensions, said Sadhan Das, the general secretary of the Joint Council of Bus Syndicates.        
	Transport department officials are worried over the fate of certain routes for which the government has received no application for replacement. We will soon launch 141 new buses under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission and five Volvo buses on various routes. That will ease the pressure on the transport system to some extent. But its anybodys guess what will happen to the routes for which there are few takers, said a transport department official.        
	Government sources blamed political armtwisting for the delay in the phase out of old vehicles. The Trinamul Congress controls most bus and minibus unions. They are not cooperating with the government as the party doesnt want the phase-out, said an official.        
	Swarnakamal Saha, a Trinamul MLA and key leader of the transporters, denied the allegation. I am shocked to hear this. The department is only trying to cover up its failures, Saha told Metro.        
	The unions, Saha added, are apolitical associations which include affiliates from all parties, including the CPM. Even if we asked our operators not to replace their old vehicles, why would supporters of other parties do so? asked Saha.

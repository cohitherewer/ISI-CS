          A STAFF REPORTER                          Alipore jail (Amit Datta)                                  
	Two groups of inmates at Alipore Central jail clashed on Sunday, leaving six persons, including a jail employees, injured and prompting the authorities to transfer some inmates.         
	At 11am, inmates led by rival gangsters Sheikh Vinod and Shabbir Ahmed, alias Ullu Raju, turned the high-security prison into a battlefield after an altercation over renovating a small temple on the premises spun out of control.         
	A free-for-all ensued as the two groups exchanged blows and hurled bricks.         
	Senior police officers, including the additional director-general (jail), S.R Hossain, rushed to the spot and managed to broker peace between the warring groups. But trouble broke out again during lunch and the authorities had to lathicharge the inmates to disperse them to their respective cells.         
	Considering the security concerns, we have decided to shift Sheikh Vinod to Presidency jail and and Ullu Raju to Dum Dum jail from Sunday. night. Four of their associates will also be transferred, Hossain said on Sunday evening.        
	Sheikh Vinod is accused of jailbreak, murder, dacoity and extortion, while Ullu Raju is in judicial custody with several murder and extortion cases against him.         
	Trouble started when members of Ullu Rajus gang complained to a warder that Vinods associates were stealing tiles from the storehouse. Vinod accosted Ullu Raju and soon the argument led to an exchange of blows, an officer said.         
	Five inmates, including Ullu Raju, were injured in the clash. A warder, Kanta Singh, 35, sustained minor injuries.        
	This was the second flare-up in four months at Alipore jail, where high-profile prisoners like Aftab Ahmed Ansari are lodged. Undertrials have formed gangs inside the jail and operate in connivance with a section of the jail staff, a source told Metro.         
	Security has been stepped up inside the jail following the clash and officers are keeping a tab on the movement of other inmates, Hossain said.

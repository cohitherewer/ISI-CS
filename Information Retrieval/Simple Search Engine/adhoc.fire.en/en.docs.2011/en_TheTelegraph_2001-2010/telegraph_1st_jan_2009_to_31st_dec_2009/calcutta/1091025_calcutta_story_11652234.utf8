	Browsing is the biggest joy of the Internet. Your Google browser brings facts, entertainment, fiction, holiday destinations and jokes right into your ken. Try keying Puri into your browser and you will know immediately how to reach Puri, where to stay, historical sites to visit, vistas of the ocean in exquisite technicolor.         
	Plan your next holiday with panache, get the tickets as I told you in an earlier instalment, book your hotel and then go and have fun.        
	You will also get blow-by-blow descriptions of how to make puris to eat, indeed recipes of all kinds. Whether it is shukto or labra as Thakuma made it, or exotic recipes  they are all there.         
	There are at least six for chingri machher malay curry. And yes it is Malay curry: the cooking with a lot of coconut milk is a speciality of that region. Some enterprising traveller to Malaysia must have brought it home for us to use in later years if we hadnt exported it in the first place!        
	As an aging person, you will often find your doctor talking down to you. He assumes you do not know about either the nature of the disease or the possible treatment of it. Ask your doctor mujhe kaunsi bimari hai? (what is the illness I am suffering from?) and the doctor might well reply: Maji is bimari ka naam hai budhapa. (Mother, this illness is called old age.)         
	You can find out as much as you wish about any illness, including treatment, side effects of drugs, vitamin covers, appropriate diet and also blogs of ordinary people who tell of their experiences with the disease and the treatment.         
	Armed with the facts, you can meet your doctor or your all-knowing children on a more level playing field. One can learn to tackle chronic old age problems such as forgetfulness, loneliness, incontinence or depression. It helps to know you are not the only person to suffer from them and you might find ways of dealing with them that do not require you to take either drugs or the condescension of your doctor or relatives.         
	With the more serious kinds of illness this knowledge gives you a certain agency: if you think for instance, that the cure is worse than the disease, you can opt out of it and select serenity instead. The following website gives you the West Bengal governments take on the National Policy for the aged: http:// www.jnanajyothi.com/         
	Neglected parents can take action and http://dpal. kar.nic.in gives you information about the legal safeguards you can summon if you wish.        
	I got the site locations from Helpage India, who will also counsel you about these and any other old age problems. Apart from mobile medical units, they have a toll free helpline: 1800-345-1253 and kind people at the other end, trained to help you tackle your problems, if you call them between 10am and 5pm on weekdays.        
	I love seeing the works of artists up front and close. Visit the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican (picture above) without getting a crick in your neck. One can see each panel in detail and also read the blurb that tells you what it represents. If there is a Jamini Roy stashed away in your ancestral home you can get some idea of the price it would fetch in the international market. From Picasso to Pyne you can feast your eyes on your monitor and zoom in for detail. One can even use sections of them as e-greetings cards or take your pick from many greeting cards sites too.         
	Please do remember that sometimes one has to verify the information on the Net. Happy browsing. In no time you will be spoilt for choice on the Internet.

										      Stage                        Habib Tanvir performs in Charandas Chor				                           
	Nandikars 26th National Theatre Festival will be on at the Academy of Fine Arts from December 16 to 25. The bouquet of plays seems smaller this year, with fewer participants from abroad (none of the usual treats from Sweden) and the selection of child-friendly plays has also been limited to Nandikars own repertory.         
	But this one is probably tailormade for the hard times we are passing through, and according to director Rudraprasad Sengupta, aims at promoting intercultural dialogue by bringing to the city voices from the so-called hot spots of disintegration, terrorism and unrest. There will be two plays from Manipur and one play each from Assam, Pakistan and Bangladesh.         
	Here is a chance to catch two Vijay Tendulkar classics from Delhis NSD repertory  Ghasiram Kotwal and Jaat Hi Poochho Sadhu Ki. Or one can enjoy Habib Tanvirs Naya Theatre productions Kamdeo Ka Apna Basant Ritu Ka Sapna, Jis Lahore Nahi Dekhya Wo Janmaya Hi Nahi (on religion, politics and tolerance) and Charandas Chor.         
	The festival is a sort of tribute to the late Habib Tanvir who had been a regular ornament in all our festivals, said Rudraprasad Sengupta.         
	There will also be an exhibition on Tanvir and Tagore.        
	Musical treasure trove        
	Academy Theatre has for the last 25 years been doing the commendable job of retrieving, preserving and propagating songs from the Bengali stage. Though written, composed and performed by some of the greatest creative talents of the Bengali stage, manchagaan (stage songs) has rarely got its due.         
	Providing a powerful point of communication and interaction, songs set the mood and wove a subtext of emotion and information.         
	There have been public recitals of theatre songs by artists and composers like Debashish Dasgupta, Ketaki Dutta and Murari Roychowdhury in the past but no regular institution devoted to it.        
	Founders Devajit and Riddhi Bandyopadhyay have been stirring public interest in performance of theatre songs, through recitals at various venues. Three days of performance will mark the Academys silver jubilee at Rabindra Sadan (December 18-20) supplemented by a four-day display of theatre-related paintings, drawings, cartoons, posters, calendars and book covers.         
	Academy Theatre has at its archive on Ashwini Dutta Road a collection of over 10,000 rare audio records (a recording of Bertolt Brechts voice being one), some rare music-related publications (such as an original score from Shakespeares plays) and forgotten musical instruments.         
	At the jubilee do, the audience will be treated to the voices of yesteryear stars like Ardhendu Mustafi, Bedanabala, Angurbala, Indubala, Bijoy Lal Mukherjee, Sadhana Bose and Chhaya Devi.         
	The CD Manchagaan and a commemorative volume will also be released.       SEBANTI SARKAR

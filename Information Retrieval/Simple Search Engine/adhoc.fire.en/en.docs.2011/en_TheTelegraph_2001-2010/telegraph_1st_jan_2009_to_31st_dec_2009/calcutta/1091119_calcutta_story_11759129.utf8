                      Nature at its magnificent best                    Septuagenarian painter Shyamal Sen is at his prolific best when depicting nature in its truest form. His latest series of 15 paintings reflects natures beauty in its resplendent colours, fresh and warm. Nature and human-beings remain the most favourite subjects of his vast body of work. But, his current series gains a new and interesting dimension through his expression of the infinite. Sen fulfils the two distinct ends of any good landscape artist: the first, to induce in the spectators mind a faithful conception of any natural object; the second, to guide the spectators mind to objects most worthy of contemplation and to inform him of the thoughts and feelings with which these were regarded by the artist himself. Sens compositions are characterised by the natural and spontaneous force, dynamism, rhythm and lyricism found in nature. Unfolding the mystery dormant in life and nature through his magical treatment of colours, his art is a conversation between himself and the surroundings that he identifies with.                  Event: An exhibition of watercolours by Shyamal Sen When: Till November 20; 4 pm - 8 pm Where: Gallery 79, 79 Raja Basanta Roy Road, 1st floor

                                                                                                               Girl injured in bid to escape molest gang
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 24-year-old girl trying to escape an alleged drug-and-molest plot hatched by a friend and two other youths was critically injured when she tumbled down a flight of stairs.        
	Police arrested two of the three accused early on Tuesday, based on an FIR lodged by the girls brother with Baishnabghata Patuli police station on Monday. The third youth  the friend who allegedly betrayed her  is absconding.        
	The incident occurred at Patuli in South 24-Parganas on Sunday night, two weeks after a student from Malda attending a party organised by new-found friends was drugged and allegedly raped in Santoshpur.        
	The Patuli girl is also not from the city. She works as an insurance agent and stays in a rented room, the police said. According to the FIR, the girl was lured to a three-storeyed house in Patuli by her friend Bapi Das, also an insurance agent. He told her that two friends of his were interested in insurance policies and wanted her to explain to them the options that were available, a police officer said.        
	Bapi, 24, escorted the girl to the house of Abdul Rahim Haldar, 25, in Patuli around 9.30pm on Sunday. The third youth, 22-year-old Raju Ojha from Sonarpur, joined them on the way. When the hosts businessman father, Abdul Rashid Fakir Haldar, asked his son who the girl was, he lied to him. Abdul Rahim took his father aside and said she was Rajus wife, an officer said.        
	The youth, a part-time driver, then took his friends and the girl to the under-construction first floor. The girls brother told the police that the trio then opened a bottle of liquor and urged her to drink. When she resisted, they used force and attempted to molest her, he said.        
	As she ran, the girl tripped and took a tumble. Abdul Rahims parents heard her shriek and rushed out of the door to see the girl bleeding and unconscious at the landing of the staircase. The three youths, including their son, were missing.         
	Neighbours admitted the girl to MR Bangur Hospital in Tollygunge, from where she was shifted to a nursing home after the arrival of her brother.        
	Abdul Rahim and Raju, a supplier of building materials, were produced in an Alipore court on Tuesday and remanded in judicial custody for two weeks.        
	The youths have been booked under sections 326, 354 and 34 of the IPC (pertaining to assault and molestation by two or more persons), the additional superintendent of police (industrial) of South 24-Parganas, S.K. Chaudhari, said.

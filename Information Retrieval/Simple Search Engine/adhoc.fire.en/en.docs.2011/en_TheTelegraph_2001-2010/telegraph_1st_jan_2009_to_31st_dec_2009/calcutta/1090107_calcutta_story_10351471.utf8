           Safety last: Daily passengers commute by a local train. A Telegraph picture                             
	The decision taken by the Bengal Engineering and Science University (BESU) authorities to introduce a revised code of conduct for the students and teachers to maintain an atmosphere conducive to education is welcome (Besu code for pupils and tutors, Nov. 14). But it would have been better if the revised code of conduct was framed after taking into account the views of all concerned including the students and the teachers. Otherwise the chances of a permanent settlement may be remote.           
	At the same time, the guardians of students may also help to a great extent in finding a solution. Their co-operation needs to be sought by the authorities concerned so that their wards may take a conciliatory attitude to maintain a peaceful atmosphere on the campus. The influence of the guardians on the students may yield fruitful results.           
	All attempts should be made to create an atmosphere of learning and goodwill so that the premier seat of learning is not disturbed again and again by agitations of students or teachers.

	After the fatal death of two commuters in a Sealdah-bound local train at Belgharia station everyone blames an abandoned killer post (Posted to kill for 20 years, November 21) on the track which is there for 20 years. No one has castigated the railway authoritys appaling callousness towards the safety and security of passengers. If there is sufficient accommodation for commuters, the question of risking lives to reach destinations would not arise. The railwayss motto of Service with a smile sounds hollow. I know, the utilitys revenue earning is disproportionate to the increased volume of traffic since free-trippers in this section are much higher compared to the Burdwan-Howrah main or chord section. Still the railways stands accused of sheer apathy towards passenger safety.             
	Subhankar Mukherjee,
  Burdwan                     
	The news that a number of young people have either been killed or injured by colliding with signal or other posts while hanging out of the doors of local trains (Life on the risky track November 20) is very sad. Cant the railway authorities do something? In this years budget the railway minister announced that all local trains with nine and 10 coaches would have 12 coaches. It will bring some relief to the passengers. But the number of trains has to be increased also. Lets hope the UPA government and its railway minister take the necessary steps.

	lHats off to Metro for highlighting the risk taken by passengers travelling in local trains during peak hours. It will be a boon if railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav takes appropriate steps to lessen the plight of passengers travelling in local trains.

	Raj Kumar Mahato and Kallol Sarkar died after hitting the transformer pole while travelling in the overcrowded Naihati-Sealdah local train. Commuters are always in a hurry and careless about themselves. But is such risk worth taking? The lackadaisical attitude of the railways towards safety norms is not acceptable. Has human become this cheap?

	Growing plants inside the house has become a trend. It provides greenery and also decorates the house. It also plays a small role in combating global warming. Thanks for the report One stop destination for plant lovers (November 13) about the house plant expo organised by Agri-Horticultural Society of India. We would be obliged if such expos are held in north and east Calcutta as well.             
	Bhupen Bose,
  Dum Dum Park                     
	Organising a plant expo is a wonderful initiative by the Agri-Horticultural Society of India. More such fairs should be organised keeping in mind global warming and the frequent chopping of trees and branches in Calcutta.           
	Sourish Misra, 
  Salt Lake                               
	Apropos your report CU examinees in a spot (November 24), it is sad that the oldest university of the country makes new rules without thinking about the consequences. Following the announcement of the results of BA and BSc Part I and II, it transpires that honours students scoring less than 35 per cent shall have to sit for Part II as general students. What would happen to students of those colleges that have no provision for general courses? Are the students fated to flounder in despair?             
	Govinda Bakshi,

	The report Third fire in shop in 3 years (November 20), did not come as a surprise. It appears that Haldirams maintains good rapport with all law-enforcing agencies and hence can continue to flourish despite blatant violations of safety norms. Apart from the frequent fires in the Chowringhee outlet fraught with irregularities, some time ago residents of both Anupama Housing Complex next to their VIP Road outlet and those next to the outlet on Syed Amir Ali Avenue had complained about noise and air pollution that went unaddressed by the CMC and other agencies. Do they owe their immunity to bhujia power?             
	A.S. Mehta,
  New Alipore                       
	Apropos the report Alert prompts security beef-up at Assembly, November 25, what about public security which is non-existent in Bengal?

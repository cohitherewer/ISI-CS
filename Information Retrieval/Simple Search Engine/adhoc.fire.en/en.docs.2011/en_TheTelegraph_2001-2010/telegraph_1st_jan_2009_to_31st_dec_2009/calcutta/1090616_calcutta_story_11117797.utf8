The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Ray favourite at film treat for children
                                                                                                                   Ray favourite at film treat for children
										                          A still from the 2006 film Hayat by Gholam-Reza Ramezani, which was screened at the festival                        
	Ray favourite at film treat for children        
	Too few films are made keeping children in mind, while the existing ones are not easily available. These were the two major points at the inaugural discussion of a childrens film festival, organised jointly by Sishu Kishore Akademi and Childrens Film Society of India.         
	The festival, held in Calcutta and in 18 districts from June 4 to 9, screened films in the DVD format through LCD projectors. The screenings were free, probably accounting for the 3,400 children who flocked to watch the films.         
	The line-up included Raja Sens Damu, as well as new entries like Gautam Benegals 2008 animated film Price and the Crown of Stone and Gholam-Reza Ramezanis Hayat.         
	The former was about a spoilt prince who runs away from his father, the cruel king, only to be mistaken for an ordinary boy and put to work in the diamond mines.         
	Hayat focused on a 12-year-old girl in a village in Iran who is determined to take an exam despite being faced with tremendous odds. Jagannath Chattopadhyays Gaja Ukiler Hatya Rahasya, based on a story by Ashapurna Debi, marked the birth centenary of the writer.        
	The festival opened at Nandan II with Satyajit Rays Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne. The other venues included Girish Mancha and Madhusudan Mancha.        
	Speaking at the inauguration, Rays cameraman Soumendu Roy recalled moments from shooting Goopy Gyne, urging the authorities to arrange for more big-screen shows of Ray masterpieces for children.         
	The chairperson of the society, Rinki Bhattacharya, urged parents and school authorities to use the societys stock of 100 feature and 150 short films. We are collaborating with BSNL to make childrens films more accessible through mobile TV viewing, she said.         
	The director of the Calcutta Film Festival, Nilanjan Chattopadhyay, rued that few producers opt to make Bengali films for children.        
	Manoj Mitra, who inaugurated the fest, remarked on the poor turnout of kids on the inaugural day. Parents must introduce children to good cinema. The society and Sishu Kishore should also come up with more films that children can carry with them into adulthood and return to again with new insights, he said.         
	That Goopy Gyne is a take-away film of the kind Mitra mentioned was evident in the way seven-year-old Kedar Ishan swayed in his seat to songs from the film. You wouldnt think he has watched it over 50 times, remarked his mother. Grown-ups too stayed for the screening and checked out the exhibition of drawings and publicity material from the film, at the Nandan foyer.

	Poverty, FAMILY DUTy no HURDLE FOR EXAMINEES  
	There were examinees who overcame tremendous odds to score well in their board exams         
	While most students had no dearth of comforts while they prepared for their board exams, there were some who overcame enormous odds to find success. They did not have enough books, could not afford tuitions, and often shared household chores even in the middle of exams. But they converted their minuses into pluses. Young Metro lists a few bravehearts.         
	Sharmila Sinha, 96.6 per cent in CBSE         
	For Sharmila, life has never been smooth sailing. Her father passed away when she was in Class II and the burden of fending for the family fell on her mother. But the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan student was not held back by the loss. I knew I had no choice but to do well in my exams. I wanted to share my mothers responsibilities, she said.         
	While preparing for the engineering entrance exams, she bought as few books as she could. She has sacrificed things which most teenagers take for granted. I dont go out with friends for movies. I dont have access to the Internet, nor do I visit cyber cafes to chat or play computer games. But thats a small price to pay for success, she smiles.         
	Susmita Chowdhury, 94.8 per cent in ICSE        
	The topper from Calcutta Public School, Kalikapur wants to crack the School Service Commission exams and bear her sisters educational expenses. My mother runs a small grocery store and sells hosiery goods. I want to support her, said Susmita, whose father is a Class IV staff in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.         
	I did not have the money to buy reference books or test papers. I photocopied them from my friend, said Susmita. She even sacrificed her study hours during her board exams to take care of the shop in her mothers absence. There were times when my father was in office and my mother had to get stocks for the shop. In no way was I going to shut the shop during peak hours, she said.         
	Ankita Bhattacharjee, 91.75 per cent in ISC         
	The humanities topper of Welland Gouldsmith School could not afford private tuition either. I did not want to add an extra expense on my mother. My textbooks were provided by the school, but I borrowed some of the reference books and test papers from my friends, said Ankita. I am also teaching kids to pay my college fees, said the girl who wants to study English at St Xaviers College.         
	Pooja Chatterjee, 87.25 per cent in ISC         
	The student of Mansur Habibullah Memorial School in Kudghat gave tuitions to pay her own fees, buy books and meet the cost of transport. My father has severe cardiac problems. He cant work. So my mother had to take up a job in a jewellery shop, said Pooja. At times, she would also walk part of the way to school, to cut down on expenses.         
	Sreya Biswas, 74.8 percent in ICSE        
	I took tuitions only in mathematics. I cut down on tuitions in other subjects, including geography and history, though I often struggled with the subjects, said Sreya, whose father is paralysed and cannot work. Her mother is the sole breadwinner in the family, giving tuitions to children. For our home science project, we have to spend elaborately. But I had to keep it simple to stay within my limited budget, she recalled.

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta police plan to install sliding iron railings on footpaths to keep pedestrians from walking on the carriageway while traffic is in motion.        
	The railings will be mounted on channels fitted to iron pillars on the edge of footpaths, according to Lalbazar. Traffic policemen will slide them shut when the traffic light turns green to restrict pedestrian access to the carriageway. At present ropes are used to rein in pedestrians.         
	To start with we want to set up such railings at intersections where there is a lot of space on footpaths. There will be levers to lock the railings in place, said additional commissioner K. Hari Rajan.        
	Traffic police sources said MG Road-CR Avenue, Elgin Road-Asutosh Mukherjee Road and Hazra intersections have been shortlisted for installing the sliding railings. If the response is favourable, the railings might be set up at other intersections.         
	Pedestrians have complained to us about ropes being used to control them. Hence we asked traffic engineers to work out an alternative, said a senior officer of the traffic department.         
	The traffic police have also decided to deploy about 1,800 more home guards on city roads.

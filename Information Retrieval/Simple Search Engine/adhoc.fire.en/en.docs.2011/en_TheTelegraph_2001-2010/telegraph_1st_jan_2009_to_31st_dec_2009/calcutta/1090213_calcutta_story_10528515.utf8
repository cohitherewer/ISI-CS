                      Contorted realism                    Nuanced linearity. Passionate colours overlapping one another. Frame after frame of resonating ambivalence. A stance that is purely amoral and complex in insinuation. At times psychotic, relating to a relentless inner turmoil. Characterised by a turbulence of spirit and a kind of existential trauma. And, a final resurgence of faith in the flux that is life, perhaps the beauty of transience. All this probably sums up the artistic creations of Jonaki Pal and her extraordinary ideas about dreams and reality. Her ongoing solo show of paintings in mixed-media features 18 enigmatic works that convey the sheer skill, power and potential of this young artist. Through an energetic blur of lines, shapes and colours, she represents reality in a visual language that is distinctively her own. Endlessly transforming familiar, everyday objects with her painterly vision, she appears to be a master of extremities, challenging conventional designs and proportions through controlled, almost rigorous mathematical reflections of her own, down to the last minute detail.                    Event: An exhibition of paintings by Jonaki Pal When: Till February 19 (except Sunday); 3 pm - 8 pm Where: Gallery Exposure, 54B Mahanirban Road

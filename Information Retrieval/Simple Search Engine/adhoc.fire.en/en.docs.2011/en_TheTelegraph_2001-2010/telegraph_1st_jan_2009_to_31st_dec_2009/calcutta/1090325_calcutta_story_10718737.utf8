The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Panel probe after fracas on campus
                                                                                                               Panel probe after fracas on campus
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The Siliguri Institute of Technology formed two probe panels on Tuesday, a day after students protested on the Salt Lake campus demanding return of course fees for poor placement.        
	The authorities also hinted at the removal of A.K. Banerjee, the head of the department of management studies.        
	More than 100 MBA students took part in the protest, prompting police action that left eight students injured.        
	A three-member committee will decide on the removal of Banerjee and an eight-member panel, which will include four students, will look into the students grievances, said Satyam Roy Chowdhury, the managing director of Techno India which runs the institute.        
	The panels will submit their reports on March 28 and the authorities will meet the students on March 30. The students seemed happy with the steps taken by the authorities.        
	Under Banerjee, we were denied even the basic facilities. He also misled the authorities about our placement, said Sayantan Banerjee, a final-year student. The authorities have allowed all 61 second-year students to sit for the exams scheduled to start on April 20. Mohammed Sadaf Alam, the final-year student who was detained by cops on Monday, was released late in the night.

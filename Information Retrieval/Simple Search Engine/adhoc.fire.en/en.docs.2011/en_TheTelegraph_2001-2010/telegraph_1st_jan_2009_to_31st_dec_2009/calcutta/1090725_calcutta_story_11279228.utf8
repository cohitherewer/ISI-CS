          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The appeals moved by Dubai don Aftab Ansari and six of his associates challenging the death sentence awarded to them by a sessions judge was taken up by the high court division bench of Justice Asim Banerjee and Justice K.D. Mukherjee on Friday.        
	Justice Basudeb Majumdar had sentenced the seven on April 28, 2005, for their role in the American Center attack in January that year, in which five policemen were killed.         
	The judge, who had allegedly received death threats after the verdict, died of heart attack two months later. Since then, several high court judges had refused to hear the appeal for personal reasons.        
	Fridays hearing was not attended by any of the convicts. Jayanta N. Chatterjee, the lawyer representing Hasrat Alam, one of the seven, made his submission during the day.        
	My client has been falsely implicated in the case. The investigators had claimed that the fake paper book and other documents in the Maruti 800 (used by the attackers) were printed in a press owned by Alam. But it is not true, Chatterjee claimed. The lawyer also said his client could not be awarded death sentence for supplying fake documents.         
	Shahid Imam is representing Ansari in the case.        
	The case is scheduled to come up for hearing on Monday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Decoded: the big Bollywood Friday face-off   Bolly addicts beware, the Friday fight is on
                                                                                                               Decoded: the big Bollywood Friday face-off     - No releases as producers demand a bigger bang for their buck amp; plexes guard their share of the pie          PRATIM D. GUPTA AND PRIYANKA ROY                            STANDALONE VS MULTIPLEX: Aa Dekhen Zara (top) that hit single screens; 8X10 Tasveer, the last plex release Kaminey starring Shahid and Priyanka is among the big Bolly releases waiting for the impasse to end                                       
	Why have producers decided not to release Bollywood films from April 4?        
	A revenue-sharing tussle is on between producers and plexes.        
	What is the producers present revenue-sharing arrangement with multiplexes?        
	Every movie is sold on different terms to the plexes depending on the size of the film and its star cast. An Aamir Khan or a Shah Rukh Khan film would have different terms from a film with a lesser star. The range would be from 45-35-30-25  the producer gets 45 per cent of the revenues in Week One, 35 per cent in Week Two, 30 per cent in Week Three and 25 per cent in Week Four  to 50-40-30-25.        
	Why this arrangement where only size matters?
    
	Ever since multiplexes came into being (2003 in Calcutta) the first week has been make-or-break for releases, with more than 10 shows a day for big Bollywood films. After a dream run in 2004-2005 with Dhoom, Bunty Aur Babli and Salaam Namaste, Yash Raj Films demanded a larger share for the producer with a 60-50-40 formula for Fanaa in 2006. The plexes, heavily dependent on Bollywood biggies, were defiant for a day but then gave in. Thus began the era of bargaining power and box-office clout. Now, Yash Chopra is demanding a level-playing field for all films.              
	What do the producers (and distributors) want now and why?        
	A 50-50-50-50 revenue sharing model, irrespective of the star cast, budget or banner. This is to protect the fraternity from the uncertainty faced every Thursday before a release. The multiplex chains collectively do not close the terms until the last moment by which time there is so much money riding on the release that the producer/distributor succumbs to their demands, says the United Producers and Distributors Forum.              
	What do the multiplexes want and why?        
	Status quo. No 50-50-50-50. We want to continue with the present system where the percentage varies according to the banner and the performance of a film, says Alok Tandon, the COO of INOX. Shravan Shroff from Fame adds: The terms are now segmented into big, small and super-flop films. If costs have gone up and they want more revenue percentage, it has to be over and above the present terms on the basis of performance. They cant give us flop films and ask for more.              
	What gives the multiplexes the clout to take on the Bollywood big boys led by Shah Rukh and Aamir?                                
	The 800-odd multiplex screens in India account for 55-60 percent of total film revenue. Around 12,000 single screens together contribute the rest, says Shroff.        
	What happens abroad?        
	We are asking for the Hollywood model of 50-50 sharing of profits between multiplexes and producers and distributors since it is a fair model. 70 per cent of the world follows this mode, says producer Mukesh Bhatt. But there are instances, in UK multiplexes, of bigger studios demanding  and getting  a 70-30 share for a mega movie. Also, there is sliding scale formula where the revenue share drops in subsequent weeks depending on how the film is doing.        
	What did Aamir mean by nut fee on Tuesday?        
	Hear it from the woman Aamir had turned to on Tuesday for help while explaining the nut fee practice of producers footing the exhibitors fixed-cost bill. The cost structure of cinema chains in Hollywood is documented. So the big studios pay the nut figure or the rentals of the multiplexes upfront for big films like Harry Potter, says Jyoti Deshpande, the COO of Eros International, the production biggie.        
	Once the rent is covered the studios can get as much as 90 per cent in the first week and then slightly less in the weeks that follow. It will be difficult to apply such a system in India, because the running costs at plexes here are not that transparent, she adds.        
	The plexes are sceptical. If he is willing to explain it we will be happy to understand, but I dont think Aamir himself is clear, says Shroff.              
	Now, who stands to gain most if the film is a hit?        
	With the producers percentage dropping every week, the multiplex turns out to be the big winner. The producer gets a smaller share the longer a film runs. Also, he does not have a say in the number of shows allotted, says Arijit Dutta of Priya Entertainment who owns Priya theatre.        
	If the producers have their say, who will gain the most if the film is a hit?        
	The producers will get a much bigger slice of the pie if they get 50 per cent revenue across all weeks. It will also spell big bucks for a small but popular film like Bheja Fry, which now gets 25 per cent in Week Four.              
	Which side loses if the impasse continues?        
	Both. Plexes will have no new software to play and prodcures will sit with big films and big money stuck in the cans. The effect on plexes is already showing; INOX is slashing the number of shows and scrapping late ones at Forum, City Centre and Swabhumi.        
	Will single screens benefit from this impasse?        
	Unlikely, as producers will not risk releasing new big films in only standalone theatres. Case in point: the flop show of Aa Dekhen Zara that released two Fridays back only on single screens.              
	Who stands to gain now?        
	Tollywood films like Anjan Dutts Chowrasta, releasing on April 17, that can get more multiplex shows than ever before. Also, die-hard Hollywood fans who can look forward to Oscar winners this month.        
	How bad do things look for the Bollywood addict?        
	Very. Says Shroff: We are mentally, physically and monetarily prepared to shut down our screens. How many English films can we play and who will come to watch them? We are already contemplating shutting down 50 per cent of the screens in South City and Hiland Park. If need be, we will shut down all the screens.

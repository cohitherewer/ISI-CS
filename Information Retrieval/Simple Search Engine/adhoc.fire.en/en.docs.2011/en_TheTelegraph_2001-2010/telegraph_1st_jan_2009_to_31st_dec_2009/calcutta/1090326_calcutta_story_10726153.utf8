The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Wall wiped clean by the hands that had defaced it
                                                                                                               Wall wiped clean by the hands that had defaced it
                                      PLACE 21/1B Pratapaditya Road
  VIOLATION Wall defaced without permission       
	The peoples movement against wall graffiti has achieved a first.        
	Last week, the wall of 21/1B Pratapaditya Road was painted in yellow, blue and red seeking votes for CPM candidate Rabin Deb. Within days, the same wall was wiped clean of the poll graffiti.                  PLACE 21/1B Pratapaditya Road
  VIOLATION Wall cleaned after residents rsquo; protest      
	How did the wonder whitewash happen? The residents had initially given us verbal permission but after we painted the wall and the photograph was published in a newspaper (The Telegraph on March 19), they changed their stand. We dont want to antagonise the residents here and so we decided to whitewash the wall, said a party cadre, somewhat sheepishly, in the makeshift local poll office at 32 Pratapaditya Road.        
	Residents of the now-landmark address are triumphant. I am very happy that the defaced wall has been whitewashed, said K.R. Subramanian, one of the flat owners. No permission was taken from us before the wall writing. We would never have given permission. We are happy that the Election Commission has taken a tough stand and we are grateful to The Telegraph for highlighting the violation on our wall, said the 68-year-old resident, who in his four decades in Calcutta has never before seen the political paintbrush brigade bowing to popular protests and wiping a wall clean.

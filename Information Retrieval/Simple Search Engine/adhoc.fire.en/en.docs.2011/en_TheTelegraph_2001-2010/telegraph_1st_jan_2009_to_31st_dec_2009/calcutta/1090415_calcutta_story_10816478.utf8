                      A womans perspective                    A contemporary Iranian artist who is preoccupied by women and their role in present day Iran, Shadi Ghadirian is a photographer with a difference. As opposed to the work of women photographers from the Middle East who live and exhibit their works in the West, her images do not play on Western sensitivities but stand on their own. The photographs at the ongoing show belong to various series: Qajar, Out of Focus, West By East, Like Everyday, My Press Photo, Be Colorful and Ctrl+Alt+Del. In her desire to define a style that is original, questioning and nationalistic, Ghadirian has found a language that expresses the conflict between the modern and the traditional as the experienced identity of her generation. Her photographs question the tradition of the veil and at the same time question the futility of modern technology to liberate women from the veil. They depict women with scratch marks, in Qajar dress, in the Chador, with blurred bodies and faces, with a Coke tin, a vacuum cleaner, a clothes press, a cycle, a newspaper and a frying pan. Censorship, gender stereotyping of jobs, routineness and obliteration of identity are manifested in her photographs. Hosted by The Seagull Foundation for the Arts.

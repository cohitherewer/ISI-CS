                                                                                                               Culture route to trade ties with China

	A Chinese delegation on a visit to the city has called for closer ties between Calcutta and Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province.         
	Cultural exchange between the two cities, which are only two-and-a-half-hours away by air, is a good way to start the process, said Dana Schuppert, a special strategic adviser to the municipal government of Kunming.        
	She accompanied a troupe of folk artistes from the region to Calcutta for a three-day trip on the invitation of the state tourism ministry. Kang Jianhua, the deputy director of the bureau of culture, Kunming, was also part of the delegation.        
	Once we form a solid friendship through cultural communication, trade relations will automatically follow, said Schuppert, who was born in Germany but is settled in China for almost two decades. Yunnan is known for its flower and IT industries.        
	I met Calcutta mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya today and invited him to visit Kunming in July with a cultural group from here, Schuppert told Metro on Thursday after a performance by the troupe at Nalban.        
	Bengal tourism minister Manabendra Mukherjee invited her and the troupe to visit the city again in March for an art and crafts fair.        
	We will stay for 12 days in March and take in as much of the state as possible, said Schuppert.         
	On November 11, 2008, Bhattacharyya had signed a memorandum of understanding on culture, tourism and administration with his Kunming counterpart Zhang Zulin at Calcutta.

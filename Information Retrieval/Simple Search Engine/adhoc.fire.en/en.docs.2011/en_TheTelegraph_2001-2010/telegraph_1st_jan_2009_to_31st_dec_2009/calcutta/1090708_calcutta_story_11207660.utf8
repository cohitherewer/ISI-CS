The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CMC to decide rickshaw fate
                                                                                                               CMC to decide rickshaw fate
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	A high court division bench ruled on Tuesday that it was for the civic body to decide whether hand-pulled rickshaws could ply in the city or not.         
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) will consider petitions by rickshaw owners seeking renewal of their certificate of enlistment, stated Justice Kalyan Jyoti Sengupta on Tuesday.        
	After the government amended the Calcutta Hackney Carriage Act to exclude portions on hand-pulled rickshaws and palanquins, the CMC stopped issuing certificates of enlistment for rickshaws.        
	In 2007, a high court trial bench had observed that the amendment did not mean that rickshaws would not be able to ply in the city without the CMCs approval.         
	The civic body had moved the court challenging the legality of the observation.        
	The division bench on Tuesday set aside the observations of the trial bench.        
	The state government had amended the act only to stop hand-pulled rickshaws from plying in the city. Pulling of rickshaws by a person is an inhuman task, Alok Ghosh, the lawyer who represented the civic body, argued before the bench.

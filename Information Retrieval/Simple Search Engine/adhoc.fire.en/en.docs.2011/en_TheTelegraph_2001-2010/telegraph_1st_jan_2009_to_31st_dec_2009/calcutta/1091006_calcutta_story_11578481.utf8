          SOUMEN BHATTACHARYA                          Suresh Bansal narrates how he had stopped the woman from jumping off the footbridge on VIP Road on Monday. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                                  
	A middle-aged grandfather stopped a young bride from jumping to her death on Monday from a footbridge on VIP Road.        
	Suresh Bansal, 52, did what few Calcuttans do these days  he threw caution to the winds and rushed forward to save a stranger, grabbing her from behind and hauling her back to safety.        
	The woman, whose name is being withheld, was later identified as a 22-year-old MA student of music, who blamed a tiff with her husband for her suicide bid.        
	She would not have lived to tell her tale  or be back by her husbands side  if it hadnt been for Bansal.        
	The resident of Sreebhumi, off VIP Road, left home around 2.30pm. Like any given Monday, the man who lives with his wife, son, daughter-in-law and one-year-old grandson, took the footbridge across VIP Road to take a bus to his shop of tiles near Lalbazar.        
	But on the footbridge, a chilling sight awaited him  a young woman in a salwar kurta had slipped through the railing and was poised to jump. She was crying loudly.        
	Some other pedestrians were standing and staring at her, not daring to step forward. Just when Bansal was wondering what to do, he spotted the woman letting go of the railing with one hand.        
	There was no time to think any more. I could not possibly stand there and watch her leap to her death. So, I rushed forward and grabbed her from behind, the trader told Metro.        
	Realising that he could not haul her up alone, Bansal started shouting for help.        
	Leave me alone, let me die, the woman kept shouting, but Bansal held on.        
	With other pedestrians lending a helping hand, Bansal managed to lift her back to safety and she slumped unconscious.        
	We revived her by sprinkling water on her face. I asked her her name, took the mobile phone from her bag, dialled her father in Phoolbagan and her husband in Garia, and told them to come to Lake Town police station, said Bansal.        
	He then called up the police station. A jeep arrived to take away the woman and her saviour. Bansal finally left for his shop around 4pm.        
	Before being handed over to her father, a retired state government employee, the woman told the police that she was having trouble with her in-laws.         
	Upset with my husband, I decided to end my life, she told the police.        
	When contacted at her fathers house late on Monday, she said: I am really ashamed of what I did today. I would have died if that man (Bansal) had not caught me.        
	A family member said she was battling psychiatric problems and was on medication.

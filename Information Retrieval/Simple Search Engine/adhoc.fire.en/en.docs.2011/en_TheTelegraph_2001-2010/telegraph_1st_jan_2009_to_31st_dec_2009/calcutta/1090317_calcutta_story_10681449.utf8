The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Drive for fairway as destination
                                                                                                               Drive for fairway as destination
  - Golf equipment major plans big in city with worlds second oldest course           SUBHRO SAHA                          CALCUTTA CALLING?: Sergio Garcia                                         
	Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC) could soon become a destination course for the globe-trotting golf tourist.        
	International equipment major TaylorMade-adidas Golf is eyeing the south Calcutta fairway, the oldest outside the British Isles, to reach out to a wider audience. We will work to promote the Royal as a must-play course to be mentioned in the same breath as St Andrews (in Scotland) and Augusta (in Georgia, US). We are talking destination golf here and the course being on the golfing pilgrimage route, said Dennis P. Allen, the vice president and managing director of TaylorMade-adidas Golf (Asia-Pacific region).        
	TaylorMade, a subsidiary of the Adidas group and the worlds leading manufacturer of golf drivers, is hopeful of flying in greats like Sergio Garcia, Justin Rose and Retief Goosen from the PGA Tour. They are all powered by our drivers and we get a certain number of days with them for promotional activities. We see great scope for Calcutta soon hosting one or maybe a couple of them, said Allen.        
	Royal, the birthplace of the Indian Golf Union, is happy at the TaylorMade move. Its a wonderful plan and will serve to convey the heritage value of this pioneering institution to todays generation. We are also getting ready to welcome the world on our manicured greens, said M.M. Singh, the CEO of the 180-year-old club.        
	California-headquartered TaylorMade-adidas Golf has big India plans, with Calcutta definitely figuring in them. We are planning a mono-brand franchisee outlet in Calcutta, one of only five across India at the moment, said Ateet Gaur, the country manager.        
	In Delhi, the company has teed off a pilot project in three schools, setting up a driving range and a simulator to draw more students to the sport. The same model will be replicated in other golfing cities, including Calcutta.        
	TaylorMade dealers will also conduct roadshows and demo clinics in town to broad-base awareness on golf and give beginners an opportunity to tee off. We hope to create enough demand for investors to feel there is a reason to set up more driving ranges here, observed Allen.

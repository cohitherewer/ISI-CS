The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Parents protest school fee hike
                                                                                                               Parents protest school fee hike
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	More than 500 parents of the students of St Anthonys High School demonstrated in front of the institution on Friday morning, protesting the hike in tuition fees and demanding an immediate rollback.        
	The Market Street school, near New Market, has increased the fees by more than 60 per cent in order to pay salaries to its teachers and other employees according to the enhanced pay scales recommended by the Fifth Pay Commission.        
	The school cannot pass on the entire burden of the pay panels award to the guardians, protested Faiz Alam, the secretary of the Association of Parents of St Anthonys High School, which was formed after the authorities put up a notice on March 16 informing the parents of the hike.        
	The notice, signed by school secretary Father Hansel DSouza, states that the fee for junior students has been raised from Rs 590 to Rs 990 and that for senior students from Rs 690 to Rs 1,140. The new fees will be effective from April 1.        
	Taking all aspects into consideration, we have tried to keep the quantum of increase to the minimum possible, the notice adds.        
	Alam, who along with the other parents gathered in front of the school at 8am and held a demonstration till noon, said: Most students at St Anthonys are from lower middle-class families who cannot afford to pay such high fees.        
	The parents, he added, will demonstrate everyday till the hike is revoked.        
	Headmaster Father G. Peppin met a delegation of the parents and received a letter listing the demands. The schools governing body will take up the issue, he said.        
	Moloy D Costa, the inspector of schools under the Archdiocese of Calcutta, including St Anthonys, said the decision to raise the fees was taken following talks with the founder bodies of all schools. We have no other way to meet the expenses following the states decision to implement the pay panels report. Other schools under the diocese, too, will follow suit.        
	The state government accepted the report early this month and announced a 32-36 per cent hike in the salaries of its employees and the teachers and non-teaching staff of state-aided schools. The new scales will be implemented next month with retrospective effect from April 2008.        
	Rules state that private schools, including those that do not receive any grant from the government, are required to pay their staff on a par with the employees of aided schools.

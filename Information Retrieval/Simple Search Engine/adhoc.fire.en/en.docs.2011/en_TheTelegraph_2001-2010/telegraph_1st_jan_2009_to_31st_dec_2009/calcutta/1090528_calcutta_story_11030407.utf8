The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | The fans whirred after 37 hours
                                                                                                               The fans whirred after 37 hours

	The wind pulled my wrist through the grille as I reached out to shut the storm-soaked windows. Glass shattered somewhere. Then the lights flickered. Must be a minor voltage fluctuation.        
	They flickered again. And again. Then they went out. A tree had collapsed, snapping the power lines, its branches entangled in the wires and a pole bent under the weight of rain-soaked wood and foliage.        
	It was 12.30, Monday midday, and the beginning of what would be a 37-hour ordeal at South End Park.        
	The inverter stuttered to life, but after two hours, with no sign of the power coming back, my grandmother switched it off. Long night ahead. Better conserve.        
	The stretch outside, tree-lined, shaded, often a carpet of fallen flowers and leaves, looked like a quake zone. The tree lay across the street, an immense, impenetrable bush. A boundary wall of a house had sunk in a heap.        
	People milled around, desperate cellphones pressed to their ears. 1912, someone shouted from a balcony above. Engaged, said a man, pacing up and down. Ive been trying since the last half an hour, complained an elderly lady.        
	Cyclone Ailas fury had taken its toll on even the four digits of hope CESC holds out in normal times.        
	Around 7pm, someone called to say there would be no power for the night. The men clearing the roads would not be able to make it here. It wasnt on the main road, you see, the caller explained. Thats what he had been told.        
	Inside the house, my grandmother, 73, sat huddled. No lights. No TV. No crossword. My little brother, Pippu, going on 10, fidgeted.        
	2.30am: hope flickered and died almost as soon.        
	Some CESC officials arrived, but their faces said it all after one look at the cable-entangled branches. The narrow ones they can snip, they said, but they needed permission from the corporation to cut the big branches. They also didnt have the tools required. Phut!        
	With morning dawned a more imminent problem  lack of water. It was nearly 20 hours, and no power meant no electricity to switch on pumps.        
	Around 2.30, the taps started gurgling. The overhead tank had gone dry. I went out and bought mineral water.        
	Corporation officials finally came  with tree-cutters  around 11pm. A CESC van arrived after the branches had been cleared.        
	The lights came back sometime around 2am, and the ceiling fans whirred again, 37 hours after they had stopped.

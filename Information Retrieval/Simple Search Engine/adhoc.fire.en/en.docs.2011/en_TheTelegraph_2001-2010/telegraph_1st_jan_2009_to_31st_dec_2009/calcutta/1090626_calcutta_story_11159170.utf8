The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sourav bats for school project
                                                                                                               Sourav bats for school project
          A STAFF REPORTER                                                Sourav Ganguly    
	Sourav Ganguly asserted on Thursday that he would set up a school in Salt Lakes CA block despite protests from residents.        
	The issue is being needlessly politicised. I have followed all the rules. Problems with the residents will be resolved through discussions and the school will definitely come up, said the former Team India captain at the prize distribution ceremony of the Videocon School of Cricket in the township on Thursday afternoon.        
	About 80 members of a Salt Lake-based, Trinamul-backed NGO and residents of the township staged a hunger strike opposite the CA222, the plot of the proposed school, from 9am to 5pm to protest the project.        
	The agitators alleged irregularities on the governments part in handing over the plot to Sourav and said the school would add to the congestion in the residential area.        
	Rajat Maitra, the treasurer of the CA Block Residents Association, which has been leading the protest, said: We welcome the hunger strike but we were not involved with it in any way.

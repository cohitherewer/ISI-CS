	T-72 Main Battle Tanks, BMP amphibious infantry fighting vehicles and Cheetah Choppers will make their way into the heart of Calcutta next week. Not for a battle but as main attractions of an exhibition organised by the army.         
	The Know Your Army show near the HRBC gate on the Fort William driving range will offer civilians a peek into the weapons and electronics and telecommunication equipment used by the force, ahead of the Indian Army Day on January 15.         
	Personnel of the Ghatak platoon will parade around the venue in combat gear  bullet-proof jackets, automatic assault rifles, sniper rifles and night vision devices used during the 26/11 operation.        
	Army horses, sniffer dogs, explosive detector dogs and tracker dogs from the Remount amp; Veterinary Corps will also be present.        
	Dogs and horses are the best friends of an armyman. People will get an opportunity to see how helpful these animals are in various operations, said an officer at Fort William.        
	Children will get the opportunity to see handheld rocket launchers, 105mm guns and T-72 tanks from close quarters.         
	These artillery and equipment are not decorative. They are used to fight the enemy, added the officer.        
	This is a familiarisation exercise. The idea is to make the young generation aware of the role of armed forces in protecting the country from the enemies. We have also invited various schools and colleges to visit the exhibition, said group captain and the chief public relations officer (east) of the defence ministry, R.K. Das.        
	The exhibition will also help bridge the gap between the military and civilian population, he added.        
	To create more awareness about the armed forces, Vijay Diwas celebrations in December were open to civilians for the first time since 1971.

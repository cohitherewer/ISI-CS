                      Going for gold                    Founded on June 29, 1960 by a group of committed, young theatre-persons, Nandikar has indeed come a long way. Today, as it steps into its 50th year, it is no longer just a performance-oriented theatre group, but an institution with a wide range of socially-oriented creative projects, including its popular annual National Theatre Festival. To mark this glorious occasion, the group stages this evening its latest production, Ajnatobass. The play begins with a lady, well past her middle-age, looking for a place to rest. Payel, a newly-married woman, offers a glass of water to the old lady. In fact, she is also looking for someone to talk to, as she is very lonely. Apprehensions and fears dominate the lives of Payel and her husband Soumik. They are faced with an extraordinary situation regarding the old lady. They do not know how to handle someone who remembers nothing of her past, and yet, is so alive, so fascinating. The open-ended play leaves the audience asking a number of questions: Does the old woman remember her past at all? Where will she go from here? Will Payel and Soumik also follow in her footsteps? Directed by Sumanta Gangopadhyay. Directorial advisor: Rudraprasad Sengupta.

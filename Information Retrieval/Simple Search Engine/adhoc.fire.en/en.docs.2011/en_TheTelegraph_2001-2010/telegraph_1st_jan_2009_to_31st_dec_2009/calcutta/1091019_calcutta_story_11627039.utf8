The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Its a taxi, but not an Amby
                                                                                                               Its a taxi, but not an Amby
          ANASUYA BASU                          The Indigo taxi at the showroom                                  
	The monopoly of Ambassador taxis in the city will end as soon as Panchu Mondal starts plying his new Indigo TDI.        
	Mondal drove home the yellow taxi from RD Motors on VIP Road on the eve of Diwali.        
	I am waiting for clearance from the motor vehicles department. It should come in two or three days, after which I will ply my new taxi, said Mondal, who plans to drive the Indigo himself on Sundays and holidays and hand over the keys to a driver on weekdays.        
	Mondal used to drive his 1986 Ambassador taxi before the high court banned commercial vehicles over 15 years old. Former transport minister Subhas Chakraborty cleared the way for 1,000 Indigos and 1,000 WagonRs to ply as cabs in Calcutta to fill the void created by the pullout of 6,000 old taxis.         
	The Maruti WagonRs that have been allowed to ply as taxis run on both petrol and LPG.        
	We had made a presentation to the minister and were allotted 1,000 vehicles to replace existing taxis. We are passing on the government subsidy of Rs 20,000 and our discount of Rs 60,000 to the cab buyers, said Gautam Mukherjee, the regional manager (passenger car business unit) of Tata Motors, which manufactures Indigo.         
	The cab-owners are being granted the subsidy after surrendering their old vehicles. We are turning the old taxis into scrap and submitting the engine and chassis numbers to the state government, said Pradeep Jain of RD Motors.         
	Fifteen Indigo cabs have been booked at RD Motors till date. The Indigo will offer Calcuttans a much better ride. Besides, we are ready to deliver cabs within a month of booking. Hindustan Motors is not in a position to supply more than 200 vehicles a month, added Jain.        
	The Bengal Taxi Association, however, is not happy with the choice of Indigo. It is a costlier vehicle compared with the Ambassador. Besides, its spares are not easy to obtain, said Bimal Guha of the association.        
	He felt that instead of replacing old diesel vehicles with new ones, Calcutta needs to take the LPG-CNG route, like Delhi and Mumbai, to solve the pollution problem.

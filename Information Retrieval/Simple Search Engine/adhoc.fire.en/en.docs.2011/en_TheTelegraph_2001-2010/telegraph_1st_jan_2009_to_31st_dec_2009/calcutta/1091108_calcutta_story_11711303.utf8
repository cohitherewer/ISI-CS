               The winter spread at a city market                      
	Apropos The winter of contentment November 1, I am looking forward to a happy and prosperous winter. Things are cheaper in winter because fish and vegetables are abundant. So, I hope to see the smiling faces of my friends whose sufferings knew no bounds because of the uncontrolled rise in prices of essential commodities in the past few months.             
	I am desirous of Team Indias victory in the forthcoming ODI with Sri Lanka at Eden Gardens. I also hope for an atmosphere of non-violence across the country.

	The article Much fuss over street furniture, dated October 25, was very interesting. Calcutta is a treasure-trove of antique furniture, clocks and figurines of the Raj era. These may still be found in little shops on Judges Court Road and in a number of small shops across the city.

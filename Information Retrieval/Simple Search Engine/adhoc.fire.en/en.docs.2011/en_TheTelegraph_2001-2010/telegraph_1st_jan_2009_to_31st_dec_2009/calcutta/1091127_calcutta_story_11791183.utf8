          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The state government has not yet responded to a Right to Information petition filed on September 22 for the latest figures on the crimes against women.        
	When we approached the women and child welfare department, Biswanath Choudhury, he told us that unless there was a budgetary allocation, he could not do a thing, said Anuradha Kapoor, the director of Swayam, the NGO that filed the petition.        
	According to the NGO, there are only 19 protection officers, a state agent to process a case under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, in Bengal. The number of cases filed under the act in other states is much higher than in Bengal, added Kapoor.

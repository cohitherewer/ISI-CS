The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | I heard a shot and a scream
                                                                                                               I heard a shot and a scream
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Amirul Sardar                                  
	The younger brother of the youth felled by a bullet during the football fracas leading to the Vedic Village flare-up is struggling to come to terms with the fact that he fled the site leaving his bleeding sibling behind.        
	 Bombs were being hurled and gunshots fired. People were running helter-skelter. I was so scared that I took shelter in a nearby house and dared not come out for what seemed an eternity, vegetable wholesaler Monirul Sardar, 18, told Metro.        
	Monirul had accompanied elder brother Amirul, 20, to the Golbagan Bazar in Belghoria early on Sunday to sell vegetables. The duo had stopped to watch the football match in progress near Vedic Village, around 7km from their home in Swastayangachhi, on the way back late in the afternoon.        
	I will always regret stopping at the ground. Amirul was a football fan, and he insisted on watching the match, Monirul cried.        
	The victim and his seven brothers would buy vegetables in bulk from farmers and sell these at Golbagan Bazar. Each visit to the market, around 20km away from their village, would earn the brothers a profit of Rs 700-1,000.        
	Parents Daulat Ali Sardar, 75, and Fatima Bibi, 65, sat stony-faced on Tuesday as Monirul recounted the sequence of events leading to his brothers death on Sunday.        
	I was standing and Amirul was sitting on the ground when we saw 30-40 people, some of them wearing helmets and brandishing guns, running towards the playground from the Vedic Village side. A couple of bombs went off simultaneously, he said.         
	Monirul remembers grabbing his brothers hand and running before everything became a blur for a few minutes.        
	I heard a shot, then a scream. Amirul was lying on the ground with blood gushing out of a bullet wound on the right side of his chest. I stood there screaming for sometime before running as more gunshots rent the air, he recalled.        
	Monirul entered a nearby house and did not come out for at least another hour.         
	I then remembered having stored our local MLA Arabul Hassans number on my cellphone. I called him and told him what had happened, Monirul said.        
	He finally came out of the house after Hassan reached the area along with police reinforcements. Amirul was lying lifeless on the ground.        
	The youngster who loved football and bikes had taken a loan to buy a motorcycle last year. He was possessive about his bike, said another brother.

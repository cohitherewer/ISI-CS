The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | English section in state school
                                                                                                               English section in state school

	State-run schools are finally set to open English-medium sections  possibly from the next academic session if partners in the Left Front government do not veto the proposal.        
	These units, school education minister Partha Dey said, are being planned for parents who want to send their children to English-medium schools but cannot afford the fees charged by private institutions.        
	The minister has not set any deadline for the opening of the English-medium sections but sources said the government wanted at least some of the schools to start them in the 2010 academic session.        
	We will have to open English-medium sections in state-run schools at the earliest keeping in mind the tremendous demand from middle-class parents, Dey told Metro on Friday.        
	Referring to the recent hike in tuition fees that have put several private English-medium schools out of the reach of middle-class parents, the minister said: We can give them a viable option by opening up such sections in state-run schools.        
	The fees were raised following a hike in the salaries of the employees as recommended by the Fifth Pay Commission.        
	Officials in the education department said the tuition fee in the new units would be the same as the Bengali-medium sections, around Rs 200 a year.        
	There are 42 government-run schools in Bengal, where the medium of instruction has always been Bengali. Among the leading ones are Hindu, Hare, Ballygunge Government, Bethune, Sakhawat Memorial, BD Government (Salt Lake), Sanskrit Collegiate and Taki Government schools.        
	Sources said the government would like to open English-medium sections in all 42 schools, from Class I to XII. Preparatory work to start the new sections from 2010 has long been started. The finance department has sanctioned 960 teaching posts for the new units, said a senior official in the education department.        
	The proposal has already been okayed by Alimuddin Street. In an attempt to prevent a 2008-like fiasco, CPM leaders are trying to win over other Left Front partners.        
	Last year, the partners had shot down the proposal on the ground that they had not been taken into confidence before it was tabled at the Cabinet meeting.        
	The government is also in talks with the CPM-controlled Government School Teachers Association, which has come out in favour of the proposal.        
	The state-run schools have the necessary infrastructure to offer courses in English. Given the changed circumstances, English education is what we really need now, said association general secretary Dipak Das.        
	A senior teacher of a reputable Bengali-medium school in south Calcutta said: Students now must have a sound knowledge in computers as they have to access the Net every now and then. Besides, an increasing number of students are appearing for various national-level tests which are conducted in English. The benefits of educating students in English-medium schools cannot be overstated.         
	The government also feels that once the new units are set up, state-run schools would gain in popularity among non-Bengali parents, too. We want more non-Bengali students to enrol with government schools, said minister Dey.

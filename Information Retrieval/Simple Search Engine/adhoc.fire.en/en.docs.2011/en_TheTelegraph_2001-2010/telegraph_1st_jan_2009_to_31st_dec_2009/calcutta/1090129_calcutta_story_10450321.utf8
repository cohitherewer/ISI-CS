                      Inspired by the elements                    The five elements of Indian thought, shunya (space), vayu (air), agni (fire), jal (water) and prithvi (earth) are linked through their very concept, complementing one another perfectly to sustain both the macro and microcosm. Inspired by these primal elements and choreographed in Kathak, Ranans production Shunya Se draws on various music genres and design elements to create a breathtaking audio-visual tapestry. First produced in 2003, Ranan has performed excerpts from it at various festivals and venues across India since, with its characteristic grace, vibrancy and visual magic. In conception and range, this evenings presentation attempts to reach beyond the understanding of choreography as a part of dance terminology. Rather, it is approached in its connotation of designing space using dance, movement, design and spatial elements in stagecraft, light, sound, music, costume, colour, scenography and theatricality. All these aspects come together to create a presentation that is both panoramic in scope and personal in experience. Concept and choreography: Debashree Bhattacharya and Vikram Iyengar.                  Event: Shunya Se, a choreographic presentation in Kathak by Ranan When: Today at 7 pm Where: Rabindra Sadan

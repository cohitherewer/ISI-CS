The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Crash kills engineer
                                                                                                               Crash kills engineer
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The mangled taxi. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                  
	A 28-year-old marine engineer and the driver of the taxi he was travelling in died when the vehicle collided with a state bus at the Red Road roundabout in front of the Fort William main gate around 5.45am on Tuesday.        
	A student of marine engineering, who was in the taxi along with the engineer, was seriously injured.        
	Police said one of the vehicles had violated the signal. We are trying to find out which one did, said an officer.        
	Ajay Kumar, who worked with a private shipping company as second engineer, suffered critical injuries in the head and chest and was declared dead on arrival at SSKM Hospital.        
	Chandan Kumar, who was sharing the rear seat with Ajay, fractured his right leg and suffered head injuries. The 22-year-old, a student of Marine Engineering and Research Institute in Taratala, is being being treated at CMRI. Hospital sources said he underwent surgery late on Monday.        
	The taxi driver, Iftekar Alam, was a resident of Beleghata. A family friend said his wife was pregnant.        
	Police said Ajay and Chandan were on their way to the engineers rented flat in Parnasree, Behala, from Calcutta railway station in Chitpur. The CSTC bus on route 12D was travelling to Howrah.        
	A cop at an outpost close to the mishap site said both vehicles were travelling at a high speed. The bus skirted the roundabout and was speeding towards Dufferin Road when the collision occurred. The driver of the bus, Tarun Bhadra, has been arrested.        
	Ajay lived in Parnasree with his wife and two children, aged two years and six months. The family had gone to Ajays ancestral house in Patna, where his wife and two children were supposed to stay a while, said Sanjay Kumar, a friend.        
	Ajay and Chandan, a neighbour of the engineer in Patna, returned from Bihar early on Monday and took a taxi home from the Chitpur terminal.        
	Cops described the roundabout as a death trap in the early hours of the day. Traffic from three directions hit the roundabout in the early hours because Lovers Lane remains closed for the Mounted Police and Casurina Avenue becomes two-way. The roundabout is one of the 48 crossings where we run extra vigil on vehicular movement beyond traffic hours, said an officer.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Christmas, coldest in recent Met memory
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta is set to enjoy its coolest Christmas in recent Met history with the weatherman expecting the mercury to touch a minimum of around 12 degrees Celsius.        
	Friday is likely to be chilly and windy, with the possibility of the mercury dipping to the sub 12-degree level.        
	Friday is likely to be the coolest Christmas Day this decade. In fact, there are very few instances of the temperature dropping to 12 degrees Celsius on December 25 in Calcuttas recorded Met history, said an official of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) in Delhi.        
	Thursdays minimum temperature of 12.5 degrees Celsius  a degree below normal  was a December 24 record this decade. The coldest day of the season so far was also the coldest December day since December 28, 2004, when the temperature touched 12.2 degrees Celsius, two degrees below normal.        
	On Thursday, the minimum temperature at the airport was 11.4 degrees Celsius.        
	A scientist at the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting in Noida said the minimum temperature might drop by another degree in the next 24 hours because of the intense cooling effect of the dry northwesterlies, strengthening by the day across the eastern plains.        
	The citys next Met target this winter is the coveted sub-10 degrees Celsius.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Factory ordeal for residents
                                                                                                               Factory ordeal for residents
  - Caretaker flaunts forged clearances          A STAFF REPORTER                          Policemen and forensic experts at the Belgachhia factory, which was razed in a fire, on Wednesday. (Sanat Kr Sinha)                                         
	The 70-plus manufacturing units within Belgachia Villa remained shut on Wednesday, a day after three men were charred to death in a fire in one of the units.         
	The 500-odd residents of houses on the premises, most of them descendants of people who once served the owners of the sprawling estate, crave more than temporary respite.         
	It took three deaths to attract the attention of the authorities to these illegal units. But after a few days, they will start functioning again, said Dibyendu Mukherjee, a resident of the villa, pointing to a closed factory that manufactures plastic balls.         
	Huge sacks containing balls could be seen through its open window. Five LPG cylinders that used to operate the machine were kept in a corner with electric cables hanging over them.        
	Four families stay near the factory. The noise and the smell of LPG are unbearable. And a fire can break out any time. We do not want to be burnt to death like the three workers last night, said Santu Pal, another resident.         
	The other factories dotting the serpentine lane in the estate appeared equally dangerous. Metro visited the Satyam Plastics unit, a few meters from PS Industries, where the blaze occurred on Tuesday. The 200sq ft room with false ceiling and a single entry point was filled with plastic containers of various shapes and sizes and the two machines that manufactured them.         
	Nobody can touch us. We have the mandatory permissions, said caretaker Samar Ghosal, flaunting papers from the fire department, pollution control board and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.         
	Residents claimed the documents were forged and the owners ran two other factories on the premises. We have never seen any of the units being inspected, said resident Gaurango Pal.         
	The burnt factory, however, was scanned on Wednesday morning for evidence to determine the type of chemicals that were stored in it. The fire could have destroyed the entire area, said an officer of Ultadanga police station who was part of the inspection team, which included forensic experts.        
	The owner of PS Industries, Sushato Kundu, was arrested by on Tuesday night.        
	Fire minister Pratim Chatterjee said: Our officials will have to check whether the factories in the area are operating illegally. It might take some time.        
	The caretaker of the estate, Madhusudan Nandi, could not be reached.

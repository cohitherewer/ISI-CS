                                                                                                               JU mistake in letter to panel
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jadavpur University has admitted to the National Commission for Minorities that it stated the qualifications of an applicant incorrectly while justifying his selection as geology lecturer over another candidate.        
	Babar Ali Shah, a research scholar in the department, had lodged a complaint with the commission last October claiming that he was more qualified than the candidate chosen for the post.        
	The university wrongly told the commission in December last year that the research fellow from IIT Mumbai who was chosen as lecturer on September 15, 2008, had completed his Ph.D before the selection, registrar Pradip Kumar Ghosh stated in a recent letter to the commission.         
	The candidate submitted his thesis only a week before his selection and got his Ph.D in January, after joining the university.        
	I did my PhD in 1999 and have nine years of post-doctoral research experience with 15 refereed publications, including in 10 international and five national journals, Shah wrote in one of his letters to the commission.        
	He further wrote: the person selected for the post did not obtain PhD degree till the date of the interview. He had only one published referred national paper till that date.         
	The registrar maintained that the decision of the selection committee was final.

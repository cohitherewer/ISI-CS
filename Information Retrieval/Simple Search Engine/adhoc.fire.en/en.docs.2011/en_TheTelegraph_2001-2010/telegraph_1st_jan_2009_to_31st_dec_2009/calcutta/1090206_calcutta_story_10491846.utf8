The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Olympic sport to beat biz blues 
                                                                                                               Olympic sport to beat biz blues 
          A STAFF REPORTER                           Sourav Ganguly                                  
	American companies may be turning to Indian spirituality but city corporates prefer sports to beat downturn blues.        
	The Indian Chamber of Commerce, along with the Bengal Olympic Association, has organised a five-day Corporate Olympiad in the Sports Authority of India (SAI) complex in Salt Lake from February 13.         
	Six hundred professionals from 32 business houses in the city will make their Olympic debut as they march behind the flag-bearers of their organisations.         
	Todays professionals are under tremendous stress. The mental meltdown is obviously accentuated by the financial downturn, which has made these the most challenging of times. By holding this tournament, we would like to reduce stress levels so that spirits are high, said Sanjay Budhia, the president of the chamber.        
	Ask Circle, an association of financial distributors, is also organising for the first time a tournament to energise everyone in these times of crises. Twenty financial companies, including HDFC, ICICI Prudential and IDFC, will take part in the events on Sunday, said Kanak Kumar Jain, the secretary of the association.        
	The Corporate Olympiad will start with a 3.5km torch relay from Bidhannagar Municipal Football Ground to the SAI complex, in which Sourav Ganguly and other sports stars of the city are slated to take part along with 300 athletes.        
	The five-day games feature three team events  nine-a-side ten10 cricket (ten overs a side), seven-a-side football and volleyball  and four individual events  table tennis, lawn tennis, badminton and chess.        
	The lawn tennis matches will be played at the Bengal Tennis Association courts. All other events will be held in the SAI complex.        
	Kamalesh Chatterjee, the general secretary of the Bengal Olympic Association, told Metro that national-level referees and umpires would officiate the events.        
	Unveiling the trophy that will be presented to the overall winners, former lawn tennis and squash player Akhtar Ali said: This is a great initiative because it serves a dual purpose. Sports is good for the health of the employees. Moreover, such tournaments bring the corporate world closer to sports and will hopefully generate some sponsorship for our sportsmen.        
	Rupak Barua, the CEO of CMRI, which is fielding a team, said the employees must be given opportunities to relax to be able to produce their best.        
	Anand Kumar, who worked in an employee-branding role in Wipro, said the Corporate Olympiad was an excellent idea as participation in team events helps bonding among employees.        
	The tournament has a special significance in these times of financial crunch. Sports events have the potential to wipe away all negativity and gloom, added Kumar.

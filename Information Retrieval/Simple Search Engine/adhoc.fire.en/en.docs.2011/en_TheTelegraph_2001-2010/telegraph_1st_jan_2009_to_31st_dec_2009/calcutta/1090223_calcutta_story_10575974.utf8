The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Realtor killers identified 
                                                                                                               Realtor killers identified 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Howrah police on Sunday claimed to have identified the five youths who shot Debabrata Biswal, a real estate developer with a shady past, at the Shibpur crematorium on Saturday.        
	Based on the accounts of witnesses, we have zeroed in on those who attacked Debabrata. The murder was the fallout of gang rivalry, said a senior district police officer.         
	Most of the 50-odd people, who were present at the crematorium when the five pumped bullets into 35-year-old Biswal have refused to speak to the police.         
	The five came to the crematorium on three motorcycles around 1.30pm and headed straight for Debabrata, who was waiting to collect his friends ashes.        
	The promoter ran towards the river, hardly 100ft away, but was shot down before he could dive in. The assailants walked to the motorcycles and sped away.        
	Debabrata was involved in extortion in Alambazar before trying his hand at real estate. His rivals had a hand in his killing, said an officer.        
	According to a preliminary investigation, Debabrata had grabbed plots in Alambazar by terrorising residents, which angered members of a rival gang which was eyeing the same land.        
	It seems Debabrata had a lot of enemies. He was probably killed because he was spreading his reach, said an investigating officer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Flawed flesh, a capital experiment 
                                                                                                               Flawed flesh, a capital experiment 
										      eyewitness      
	Samaresh Chaudhuri is a senior artist better known as a teacher. His recently concluded exhibition of drawings and some paintings at the Academy of Fine Arts shows that he has not lost his touch.         
	Most of the drawings are academic studies of the old school but they demonstrate how skill is what really matters most in this case. He has chosen to do studies of human beings with flawed and sagging bodies with generous folds of belly fat.                   
	The women are large like recumbent seals and Chaudhuris gaze takes ruthless stock of their abundant flesh that makes no attempt at concealing its vintage. The same goes for the men. While most of the women  clearly Bengali housewives  are unabashedly nude, the men look coy in underclothing. The young man in briefs is certainly a Bengali, and although slim, there are already touches of flab around his midriff (picture left). Nude or semi-nude they may be but they are totally devoid of eroticism. They could be still life.         
	Chaudhuris line drawings of beggars, street dogs and crows are true to life and executed with the minimum of fuss. His studies of human heads are amazing. The woman with an ageing face and high cheekbones and the bearded man stand out of the sheets on which they have been drawn. Having said this, it must be stated that Chaudhuri seems to lack imagination. Samaresh Chaudhuri is like a mirror capable of capturing reflections, but without the catalyst of imagination they only remain images close to real life.                        
	A group of relatively young artists from Mumbai  Tushar Joag, Justin Ponmany, Prajakta Potnis, Sharmila Samant and Uday Shanbhag  had decided to turn their righteous indignation against SEZs, or special economic zones, close to their hometown. All at the expense of Experimenter gallery that had courageously decided to take up this project that lasted almost a month, and involved a video conference with the artist activists interviewing the victims of the SEZs, a heap of salt moving from one end of the gallery to the other, various images of rats sent by the artists via e-mail appearing on the walls, and a scarecrow gradually taking shape from bits and pieces also sent via the Internet (picture right).         
	At the end of it all, the artists had created telephones, which, when one pressed the right buttons, at the right moment (following the recorded instructions) gave one the privilege of hearing the recorded hullabaloo (perhaps simulated) of demonstrations against SEZs. With all the artists dressed for the occasion, visitors must have enjoyed this privilege in the chilled environs of the gallery, sipping white wine and nibbling on snacks. It was capital.

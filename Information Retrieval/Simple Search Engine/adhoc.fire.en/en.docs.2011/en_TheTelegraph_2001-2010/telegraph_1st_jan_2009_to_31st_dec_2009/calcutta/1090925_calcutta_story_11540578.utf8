                                                                                                               Devil lies in the dark cloud this Puja
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	If moist Monday was merely a hint, thunderstorm Thursday was an ominous reminder of the washout threat looming over Puja.        
	Mahasashthi brought with it the asura of heavy rain to the city  south Calcutta was soaked while parts of north and central Calcutta suffered a nagging drizzle  along with news of a cyclonic circulation developing over Bihar and adjoining Bengal.        
	The weatherman warned of a partially wet Saptami and, unless the gathering storm blows over, consistently heavy rain from Ashtami.        
	A low-pressure area is likely to form over west-central and adjoining northwest Bay of Bengal around Saturday, triggering a downpour across south Bengal, an official of the India Meteorological Department told Metro from Pune.        
	The Alipore Met office, however, held out hope for a respite, sticking to its line of erring on the side of caution so as not to dampen the enthusiasm of the people during the festive days.        
	Its too early to say for certain that the low-pressure area will form, said C.K. Dey, assistant meteorologist at the Regional Meteorological Centre. The city received 12.7mm of rain in 24 hours (till 5.30pm on Thursday). And weather experts admitted that it would need divine intervention to ensure a rain-free Puja.        
	At 12.45pm, as the overcast skies opened up, college student Sayani Sengupta and her friends scampered for cover near the Selimpur bus stop and murmured a prayer. More than an hour later, the girls were still stranded as the rain turned into a steady shower.        
	We intended visiting several pandals, starting with Jodhpur Park. But the rain has ruined our plans for the day, rued Sayani, a second-year student of Shibnath Shastri College.        
	At the Keyatala Pally Samity pandal, members of the organising committee looked up at the sky every few minutes as puddles formed on the road and the pandal made of canvas turned soggy.         
	We have worked so hard for the past three months.... This is heartbreaking. We fervently hope it doesnt rain anymore, said Abhirup Pathak, the secretary of the committee.        
	Abir Ghosh, headed for Ekdalia Evergreen with his family, cut short his trip as the rain persisted. We will be out again in the evening. Hopefully the weather gods will relent by then, he said.        
	While south Calcutta was drenched, puja organisers in north Calcutta heaved a sigh of relief when the drizzle didnt turn into a downpour.        
	We have arranged for five large sun umbrellas under which visitors can take shelter if it rains. Thankfully, we didnt have to bring them out, said a member of the Shyambazar Sarbojanin Durgotsav Committee Puja, held at Deshbandhu Park.        
	For Sibsankar Basu of Maddox Square, Thursdays rain was the worst possible start to puja.        
	Its a washout on the first day itself. The park is full of water. We are using sand to salvage the ground but we wont be able to do anything if it continues to rain. We have already gone overbudget, he said.        
	Rana Dasgupta, the secretary of the Santoshpur Lake Palli committee, said it would be a tragedy if the weather were to play foul over the next four days. We have all had to work so hard to make this puja possible. When crowds throng our pandal and appreciate the work, its the best reward one can get. But it seems the rain is out to spoil the fun, he said.

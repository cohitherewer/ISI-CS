The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cops lax, snarls back 
                                                                                                               Cops lax, snarls back

	Cops who prevented snarls despite meetings by the Trinamul Congress and Citu at Esplanade on Monday could not keep traffic moving when snake charmers and Group D state government employees gathered there 24 hours later.        
	About 1,000 people assembled at the Metro Channel and Rani Rashmoni Avenue on both days but police deployment, which matched the footfall count on Monday, was down to a quarter on Tuesday. Senior officers of Lalbazar, too, were missing in action, as was the urgency.        
	On Monday, the cops had set up enclosures for the two groups of supporters before they reached the Metro Channel. Meetings of the West Bengal Governments Group D Workers Union on Rani Rashmoni Avenue and an organisation of snake charmers at the Metro Channel got underway before enclosures came up.        
	Hundreds squatted on Rani Rashmoni Avenue on Tuesday. It would have been more chaotic if we hadnt diverted the traffic, said an officer who managed traffic in the area on both days.         
	A sub-inspector told Metro: There is no plan as such. We are here because we have been told to be here.        
	A large stage was erected for the workers union meeting, forcing the closure of the Eden Gardens-bound flank of Rani Rashmoni Avenue. The other flank, too, had to be closed after the meeting started.        
	Participants started trickling in from CR Avenue, Lenin Sarani and SN Banerjee Road around 12.30pm, holding up the traffic. On Monday, policemen escorted the processions to prevent disruption. On Tuesday, they stood and watched as rallyists stopped in the middle of the road and shouted slogans.        
	I was on my way to Esplanade from Park Circus but had to get off the taxi on Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road because the traffic was not moving, said trader Naresh Sharma.        
	A Trinamul rally from Park Circus to Moulali also caused traffic chaos in the city.

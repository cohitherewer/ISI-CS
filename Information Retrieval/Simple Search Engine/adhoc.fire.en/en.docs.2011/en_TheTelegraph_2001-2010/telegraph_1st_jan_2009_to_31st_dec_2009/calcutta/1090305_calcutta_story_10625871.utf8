The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Realty focus on end-user
                                                                                                               Realty focus on end-user
  - Property fair sees home price slashed by 20-25%           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	City realtors are focussing on actual end-users, as opposed to investors, to boost the sagging property market.        
	The primary task before the real estate fraternity is to restore the confidence of the genuine customer through attractive pricing packages and by remaining vigilant on quality, Harsh Neotia, the managing director of Bengal Ambuja Housing Development Ltd, said at the inauguration of Credai Bengals Realty Expo 2009 on Wednesday.        
	Neotia was speaking at a panel discussion on the Role of real estate in the economy which stressed the need for price corrections in all segments. Most new projects showcased are priced 20-25 per cent lower than the ones in the same areas launched a year back.        
	The correction had to happen, since too much of speculative transaction had priced out genuine end-users even as investors made hay. Profitability in any sector must always be linked to social justice, said D. Subrahmanyam, the executive director of Hudco.        
	Advocating greater transparency in real estate deals, the Hudco official urged developers to focus more on the middle-income segment and do a realistic study of the demand-supply situation before launching a project.        
	Also, Credai Bengal must continue to push for the repeal of the archaic urban land ceiling act, which is stalling development of townships and seek rationalisation of levies, Subrahmanyam added.        
	Jayanta Kumar Sinha, the chief general manager of SBI, felt the time had come for all stakeholders to work in tandem to boost demand. If developers can price their products right and create enough MIG housing stocks, they can sway undecided customers into a property decision, he said.        
	The Credai brass maintained prices had finally stabilised. We had requested all our members to pass on construction cost-cut benefits to consumers and we are happy everybody has complied, said Pradeep Sureka, the president of the state chapter.        
	Almost 95 per cent demand in the residential segment is for affordable housing, agreed vice-president Santosh Rungta, saying it was time to mobilise resources to address this demand.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Terror talk amp; safety steps

	On a day the chief minister admitted that terrorists could target Calcutta, representatives of the private security industry met the home secretary seeking the governments help to train guards and secure firearms licences.         
	Kolkata-o bipodmukto noy. Ekhaneo bibhinno rokomer sontrashbadira royechhe (Calcutta is not out of danger either. Different kinds of terrorists are present here), said Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at the annual police awards on Friday afternoon.         
	Bhattacharjee did not mention the names of any terror outfit. He was possibly referring to the Maoist threat to Calcutta as his previous statement revolved around the law-and-order problems in the states three Maoist-affected districts.         
	We need to be cautious. We are facing problems in fighting terrorism in some districts like Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore, he said.         
	Bhattacharjee praised the commitment of the citys 26,000-strong police force and reiterated that there was scope for improvement. He announced that 1,200 personnel would be added to the force soon.         
	Earlier in the day, representatives of security companies called on home secretary Ardhendu Sen at Writers Buildings to discuss problems faced by the industry. The companies provide security to offices, big hotels, malls, banks, multiplexes and multi-storeyed buildings.         
	The cops alone cannot ensure security in such a big city and we think private agencies can complement the efforts of the police. But we need support from the government for the purpose, said a senior official of a private security agency who met Sen.         
	Currently, about 200 security agencies  employing about 3 lakh guards  are operating in the state.         
	According to security agency representatives, lack of training and difficulty in getting firearm licences are their biggest problems. While providing armed guards to clients, the agencies recruit people with firearm licences.         
	Security industry representatives had come to discuss problems in getting arms licence and training. I have told them that they can be helped under certain conditions, said Sen after the meeting.         
	Sen told the industry representatives that the state government would consult the Centre regarding the demand for licences for security guards.

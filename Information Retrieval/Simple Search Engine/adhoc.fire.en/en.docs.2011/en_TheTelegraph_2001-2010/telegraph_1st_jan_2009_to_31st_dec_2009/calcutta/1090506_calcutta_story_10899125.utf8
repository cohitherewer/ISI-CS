                                                                                                               Wanted: clinics for diabetics
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The city needs comprehensive diabetic management clinics as there has been a rise in the number of people suffering from the disease, experts feel.        
	Around 10 per cent of the citys adult population suffers from diabetes and the figure has been rising at five per cent every year.        
	Diabetes management includes controlling the glucose and cholesterol levels and also takes into consideration dietary practices, diabetes education, assessment of diabetic foot problems and the functioning of various organs, Subhankar Chowdhury, the secretary of the state chapter of the Research Society for Study of Diabetes in India and head of SSKMs endocrinology department, said at a recent awareness programme.        
	Chowdhury has sent a proposal to the government to set up a comprehensive diabetes clinic in one of its hospitals.        
	Helen Ali, the centre head of Take Care Diabetes Speciality Centre, said: We are planning to expand our diagnosis and management facilities.

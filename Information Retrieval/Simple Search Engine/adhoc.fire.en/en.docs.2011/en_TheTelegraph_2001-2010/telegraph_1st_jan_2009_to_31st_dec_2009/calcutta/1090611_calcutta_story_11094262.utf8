The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cash flows into culture corners
                                                                                                               Cash flows into culture corners

	Some of the citys biggest landmarks have just got richer. The Union ministry of culture has allotted to them many more crores than they were used to.         
	Better still, the ministry, which increased the budgets as part of a massive upgrade, has no plan to stop being generous.         
	This year about Rs 21 crore each has been allotted to Victoria Memorial and Asiatic Society, four to five times the amount they got in previous years, said culture secretary Jawhar Sircar, in the city on Wednesday. National Library has got Rs 19.5 crore and Indian Museum Rs 29 crore.         
	The money is meant for modernisation and probably could be called a revival package for the citys institutions, though Sircar stressed Calcutta was alive.         
	Asiatic Society, plagued by a number of problems, including reports of valuable artefacts, such as copper plates from the Pala age, disappearing, has been allotted the money to add two floors to the new building on Park Street and change its faade, and for a new building in Salt Lake.         
	Victoria Memorial, too, has got the unprecedented amount to be more accessible.         
	So far Victoria Memorial has been managed with curatorial knowledge, said Sircar. But five of its galleries, designed by the National Institute of Design (NID), should be state-of-the-art places, with souvenir shops, quality publications, lights and digitisation of artefacts.         
	National Library has got funds for the retro-conversion of records, which means the conversion of hand-written catalogue cards into machine-readable format. About Rs 9.49 crore has been allotted for retro-conversion, said Sircar. Unaccessioned books, titles sent to the library but not registered, are being catalogued. As there is shortage of staff, new books often pile up.         
	The backlog of unaccessioned books is being worked on. In the first phase, there are 2.5 lakh titles in Indian languages and 20,000 in English, said Sircar. The work has been outsourced.         
	Funds were not really the problem, Sircar said. More funds could follow depending on the capacity of the professionals.         
	There were other problems with city institutions, he acknowledged, but said that there were checks in place.         
	On the CBI inquiry against Chittaranjan Panda, secretary and curator, Victoria Memorial, under the scanner following allegations of fake works of art installed at the memorial, Sircar said the authorities were waiting till the probe was over. But he added that he has spoken to the CBI director on the matter, stressing that the image of the memorial should not be tarnished.         
	Sircar also allayed fears about the suggestion of installing a mansard roof atop the Indian Museum. Many feel a sloping roof, like the one at Writers Buildings, would be a disaster for the museum. Sircar said no decision was taken yet; one would be taken only after public discourse and ensuring that the building can withstand such an installation.         
	On the disappearance of artefacts from Asiatic Society, in which some feel high-powered insiders are involved, Sircar said that the institution, along with a few others, has been asked to go for 100 per cent cataloguing after physical verification, which would record an item only after it was found to be physically on the premises.         
	That way, he said, if a Buddha head was in the catalogue, it would be found within the institution too.

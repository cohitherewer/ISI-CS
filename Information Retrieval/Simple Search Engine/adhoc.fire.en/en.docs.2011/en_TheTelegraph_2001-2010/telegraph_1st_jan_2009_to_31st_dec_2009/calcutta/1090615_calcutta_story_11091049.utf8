The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rail pier block on Bypass
                                                                                                               Rail pier block on Bypass

	Work on setting up piers for East-West Metro will eat up road space along 1,300 metres of the EM Bypass, between Swabhumi and Mani Square, and result in chaos along a much longer stretch of the speed corridor.        
	Construction has begun and though police have set a 90-day deadline to the urban development department, sources said work could not be wrapped up before six months.        
	Work on fencing off the median  the first step towards setting up the piers  would swallow space on both flanks, creating a bottleneck on the artery. Officials said the loss in road space would be offset by expanding the western, or north-bound, flank and shifting the median to the west.        
	Once the median is fully fenced, work on setting up the piers would start. The width of the median will be increased from 1.8metre to around four metres to accommodate the piers. To make up for the subsequent loss in road space, we have decided to stretch the north-bound flank further west along the 1,300-metre stretch, said a CMDA engineer supervising the project. The shifting of the median and expansion of the western lane will cost around Rs 1.45 crore.        
	The eastern flank  skirting Duttabad  is narrower compared with the western lane and has its own set of problems. Pedestrians often jump on the road despite the speeding vehicles. To add to the chaos, there is a slip road leading to Salt Lake. The police and traffic planners fear prolonged bottlenecks on the eastern flank, which would be too narrow to accommodate south-bound vehicles once the median is fenced off.        
	Keeping in mind the problems pedestrians would face, we have asked the urban development department to finish work within 90 days, said Dilip Banerjee, the deputy commissioner of police (traffic). We will strictly monitor the progress of work. But sources in the department feel there is no realistic chance of finishing work within six months.        
	Samiran Guha Roy, a Bypass regular, said: It would be a nightmare to negotiate this stretch of the speed corridor, especially at night. We hope the work finishes within the deadline set by the police.

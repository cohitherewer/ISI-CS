	Nothing sells like Sabya even when the rest of the city is on sale.         
	While retailers are trying to boost footfall with signs of up to 50 per cent off, buyers queued up long before the gates to 85 Lansdowne opened on Thursday morning to get a piece of Sabyasachi Mukherjee at regular, yet affordable, prices.        
	The occasion: Day I of the two-day exhibition of Sabyas spring-summer collection of pret saris, salwar suits and separates. The USP: good clothes at good prices, starting at Rs 8,000.        
	 Some buyers arrived at 9am even though the scheduled opening time was 11am, and kept asking us to open the gates, said a salesperson.         
	The gates of the designer shop-stop opened an hour early and the collection was almost sold out in the next hour. Around 250 buyers have come in till now, said store director Shalini Nopany at 11.15am.        
	Those who came in after 12 left disappointed.         
	The man of the moment was seen strolling on the pebbled lawns with cellphone glued to his ear. I am not a magician or a rock star...Its just good clothes at good prices, he said, explaining the rush.        
	Park Street resident Nikita Khan, 30, had a hard time selecting a sari because she was enamoured of them all. I really love his work, she gushed.         
	Saris formed the mainstay of the collection but a coral kalidar kurta paired with a green churidar and kota dupatta, priced at Rs 32,000, was the centre of attraction in one of the rooms of the store.         
	Take thisthis is what Aishwarya (Rai Bachchan) wears in Raavan, Sabya shouted across the room to one of the women.         
	The store will open on Friday with 10 to 15 pieces added to whatever was left over from Thursday.

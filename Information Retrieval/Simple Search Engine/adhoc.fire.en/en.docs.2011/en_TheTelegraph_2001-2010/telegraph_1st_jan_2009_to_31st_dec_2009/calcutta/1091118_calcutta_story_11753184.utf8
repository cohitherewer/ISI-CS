                                                                            Wednesday , November 18 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Emergency landing in hare scare
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A JetLite flight to Bangalore returned to Calcutta and made an emergency landing on Tuesday afternoon as the pilot suspected that the plane had hit a hare while taking off.        
	The flight took off around 5.30pm with 150 passengers on board. Within minutes, the pilot contacted the air traffic control in the city and said he wanted to bring the plane back.        
	The pilot said the aircraft probably hit a hare and sought a priority landing, said an airport official. The Boeing 737 touched down safely at 6.02pm.        
	The passengers were evacuated from the plane, which was taken to the maintenance bay and examined by engineers. There was no sign of bird or animal hit, said a Jet official. The same aircraft flew to Bangalore with the passengers around 7.10pm.         
	The pilot did not want to take a chance because the plane might have developed a snag mid-air if it had hit an animal at high speed during take-off, added the airline official. A Calcutta-Bangalore flight takes around two hours and 15 minutes.        
	Jackals and dogs often stray onto the Calcutta airport runways, disrupting flights.        
	In January this year, a JetLite flight suffered major damage after it had hit a bird around 400 feet above the ground.         
	Kingfisher disruption: Kingfisher flights from Calcutta were disrupted on Tuesday afternoon after cargo loaders contracted by the airline started a ceasework. Airport sources said a number of Kingfisher flights were delayed by one and half hours on an average.

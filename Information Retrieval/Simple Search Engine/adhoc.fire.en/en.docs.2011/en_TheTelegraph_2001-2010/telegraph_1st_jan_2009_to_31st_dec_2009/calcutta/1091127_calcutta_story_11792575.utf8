The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | ... for our cops with muskets
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      ... for our cops with muskets

	Calcutta police constables are being trained to fight crime and terror with a misfiring, British-era musket fit for an ordnance museum.        
	Police Training School, the cradle of the constabulary, has around 350 of these antiquated smooth-bore guns that need to be reloaded after every shot and fire no farther than 100 yards. Another four dozen muskets of 1940s vintage are being used by constables in some of the 48 police stations within city limits.        
	The special commissioner of police, Banibrata Basu, confirmed that muskets were being used to train recruits at the firing range. We had more of these guns before the terror attacks in Mumbai on this day last year. All police stations were asked to deposit their muskets in Lalbazar but we couldnt replace all of them. The 40-50 such guns that are still in use will be replaced soon with .303 rifles, he told Metro on Thursday.        
	Sources in the Police Training School said around 150 of the 350 muskets in the institutes armoury had become defunct over the years but the rest were still being used regularly.        
	So how do constables trained to fire muskets from the shoulder shoot from the hip when given self-loading rifles?        
	That is precisely the point we have been making at meetings but muskets remain our mainstay at the firing range. Constables are at a loss when they are handed .303 rifles, which can fire up to 1,200 yards, during field duty, said a senior officer.        
	Some of the home guards recruited before the Lok Sabha election earlier this year were trained with muskets but carried rifles to polling booths and counting centres without knowing how to use these.         
	They ran to their seniors the moment they were handed rifles. They asked basic questions like how to load a magazine, take aim and fire. Rifles are heavier than muskets and cannot be used without long hours of training. The home guards would have been in trouble had they faced a combat situation, the officer said.        
	The basic difference between a rifle and a musket is in the barrel. Modern guns have rifled barrels that make the bullet spin. Rifles also have long-range accuracy.         
	The officers-in-charge of police stations that still use muskets admit that their men will be sitting ducks for adversaries armed with todays weapons.         
	An officer of the arms department at Lalbazar said a musket was little better than a pipegun. These have long become obsolete. Maoists in Bengal are now using AK-47s and other automatic rifles while our men are expected to take them on after training with muskets, he added.         
	An official of the Ordnance Factory Board said musket spares and .410 bore ammunition meant for such weapons were last manufactured more than two decades ago.         
	The police have been using stockpiled ammunition from that period.        
	Apart from muskets, police stations in the city are equipped with .303 rifles and 9mm pistols.        
	The Special Action Force of city police is the only one that has sophisticated weapons like Insas rifles and AK-47s.

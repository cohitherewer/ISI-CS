                                                                                                               Food over fashion for Poila Baisakh

	Calcuttans are not going all out to get a new wardrobe this Poila Baisakh but have not put on hold their plans to buy jewellery and eat out to celebrate the arrival of year 1416 on the Bengali calendar.         
	The Bengali new year sees a lot of clothes shopping, though not on the scale of Puja. Thanks to the downturn, shoppers are now backing out of expensive purchases.         
	People are spending a little less but there has not been an alarming dip in sales. We saw good sales on Sunday, said Naveen Misra of Shoppers Stop. He felt Poila Baisakh shopping was largely restricted to women and children.         
	Sujata Absar of Fabindia, however, said: The women are shopping for the men. Sales have been very good in the past few days, better than last year.        
	For Chinmoy Basu of Meera Basu sari shop, opposite Sarat Bose Road post office, this is the time to experiment. We introduce designs at this time of year, so that we can gauge the response and accordingly, decide on our Puja products, he said.        
	According to him, there has been a 20 per cent drop in business. Expensive saris have found few buyers.        
	The scene is the same at Jai Lakshmi Sari House and Jai Lakshmis Heritage on Rashbehari Avenue.         
	Westerns and salwar kurtas are in demand at Shoppers Stop, where cosmetics and sunglasses are the other popular picks.        
	Kids fashion is the most happening. For girls, frilly frocks, halter-necks and summer styles are doing well. For boys, its sleeveless t-shirts and jeans with a lot of detailing. Bright colours are in for both, said Shiv Daswani of Little Shop.        
	The drop in price of gold has come as a boon for jewellers. Poila Baisakh and Akshay Tritya are considered auspicious for buying gold but because of the price cut, the buying has started early this year, said Anargha Chowdhury of Anjali Jewellers.        
	Joydeep Sirkar of B Sirkar Johuree has spotted a trend among those unwilling to spend a fortune this season. Many buyers are exchanging their old ornaments for something new. This way they only have to pay the making charge, he said.         
	The New Year feast is where Bengalis have thrown caution to the wind. There has been a flood of reservations at restaurants like Kewpies, 6 Ballygunge Place and Oh! Calcutta.         
	S. Ramani of 6 Ballygunge Place said the number of reservations are on a par with last year.        
	Anjan Chatterjee of Speciality Restaurants, which owns Oh! Calcutta and Mainland China, said: Reservations have gone up by 20-25 per cent. We have taken permission so that we can serve guests till 12.30-1am and accommodate more people.

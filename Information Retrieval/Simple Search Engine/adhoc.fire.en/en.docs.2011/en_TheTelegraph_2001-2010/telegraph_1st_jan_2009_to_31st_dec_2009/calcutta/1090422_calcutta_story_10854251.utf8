The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Melting point minus power   Why April is cruel and cloudless
                                                                                                               Melting point minus power     -  Why April is cruel and cloudless
                                                
	Four consecutive days of the heat wave-like conditions have pushed Calcutta to boiling point. The mercury touched the 40-degree mark again on Tuesday.        
	Whats worse, there is no respite in sight, at least for another 48 hours, as these conditions are likely to persist in the south Bengal districts. The city on Wednesday is likely to experience hot and sultry weather, with the maximum temperature crossing the 40-degree mark yet again, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the regional meteorological centre in Alipore.        
	Tuesdays maximum recorded temperature at the Alipore Met office was 40 degrees Celsius, four degrees above normal. The days minimum was 28.4 degrees Celsius, three degrees above normal.        
	The weatherman decoded the heat horror story for Metro.              
	Q: Why is the heat wave-like condition persisting?        
	A: Hot, dry northwesterlys are blowing in towards south Bengal because of the heat wave-like conditions prevailing over central and north India (see graphic). This wind flow is mainly responsible for the Celsius surge  Delhi, Jaipur, Gwalior and Bhopal are all in the 40-plus Celsius bracket now.              
	Q: Why are we in such discomfort?        
	A: The temperature is unusually high for April. The minimum relative humidity is also higher than usual (40 on Tuesday). So the discomfort index is in the high-60s; the normal level is 55 degrees Celsius.        
	Simply put, the discomfort index gives a numerical value reflecting outdoor atmospheric conditions of temperature and humidity as a measure of comfort (or discomfort) during summer.              
	Q: Why did Tuesday feel worse than Monday?        
	On Monday, the mercury was marginally lower at 39.4 degrees Celsius. But far more significantly, the discomfort index was 60.2 degrees Celsius on Monday and 68 degrees Celsius on Tuesday  an excruciating 13 degrees above normal, and as bad as Saturday. There was no rainfall and the city sweltered with the relative humidity ranging from 89 per cent to 40 per cent.                      
	Q: When did Calcutta last go through such a hot spell at this time of the year?        
	A: The last prolonged phase of intense heat in April was 29 years ago. The mercury soared to 41.7 degrees Celsius on April 25, 1980.              
	Q: Is there any respite in sight?        
	A: Not in another 48 hours, warns the weatherman. Relief comes in the form of a Norwester at this time of the year and the conditions are not conducive for that (see graphic). Also, the heat wave conditions in north and central India, are unlikely to ease in the next few days.              
	Q: What can we pray to the weather gods for?        
	A: Sufficient moisture in the lower troposphere; anticyclonic formations over the Bay of Bengal for a Norwester.

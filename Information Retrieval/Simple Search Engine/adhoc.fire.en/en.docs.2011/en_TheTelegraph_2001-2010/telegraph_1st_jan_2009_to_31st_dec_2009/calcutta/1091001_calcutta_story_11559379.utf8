The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rob racket busted, 2 held
                                                                                                               Rob racket busted, 2 held
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Two men in their 20s were arrested on Wednesday for allegedly snatching cash from pedestrians who had withdrawn large amounts from banks.         
	Sleuths said the gang had a third member who was on the run. The gang had snatched close to Rs 10 lakh last month by following several pedestrians on two motorcycles, the police said.         
	Mangal Bhar, the mastermind, was arrested from his hideout in Naihati, on the northern fringes of the city. We zeroed in on him after scanning the CCTV camera footage of banks, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters).         
	He said after interrogating Mangal, sleuths picked up his associate Habil Singh from Halishar in North 24- Parganas.         
	We are looking for James Singh, the third member of the gang. It appears that this gang was involved in a string of snatching incidents in September, Shamim said.        
	The police said Mangal would walk into a bank posing as a customer and identify a person who was withdrawing a large sum. He would then wait for him to leave the bank.        
	Strangely, none of the guards seemed to notice that a man was standing in one position for over 15 minutes, doing nothing, said a senior officer.         
	Mangal would follow his target out of the bank and call up his partner, waiting in a black motorcycle nearby, to give him the details of the target. Mangal would then leave the spot on a red motorcycle.         
	The associate would keep following the target, and snatch the cash at the right moment. In one case, the victim was robbed of Rs 2.5 lakh just as he was about to step into his Keyatala residence after returning from the bank, the officer added.         
	The police have so far learnt that this gang was responsible for snatching incidents in Karaya, Lake Gardens and Charu Market areas, said an officer.

	Alumnus Kaushik Basu, a Cornell University professor who took over as chief economic adviser to the finance ministry on December 8, will deliver a lecture at the 32nd reunion of St Xaviers Collegiate Schools alumni association on Saturday. Other events include a presentation on the school, which is celebrating its 150th year, and a light and sound show.        Hangman job: The post of hangman, which fell vacant after Nata Mullick died on December 14, would be offered to Mullicks son, who assisted him, or to his grandson, who works as jail sweeper. Jail minister Biswanath Chowdhury said if they declined, the government would look for others. There are 13 death row convicts in Calcuttas jails currently, but their execution dates have not been fixed.   
	 Power: Power supply might be disrupted in Howrahs Bauria, Sankrail, Fort Gloster, Ludlow and Andul between 11am and 12.30pm on Saturday because of maintenance work.         
	 Bail for doctor: The high court on Friday granted bail to Saibal Moitra, a doctor of NRS hospital, who has been charged with having sexual relations with a patient by making false promise of marriage. The doctor was held on November 13.        
	 Marriage law: The state is planning to make verification of the addresses of the bride and the groom a must before registration.

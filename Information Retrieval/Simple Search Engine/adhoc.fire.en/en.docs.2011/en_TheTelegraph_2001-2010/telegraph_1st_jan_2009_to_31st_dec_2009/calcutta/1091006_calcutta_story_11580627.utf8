                      In quest of harmony                    Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;/ Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,/ The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere/ The ceremony of innocence is drowned...  W.B. Yeats        Since the onset of cubism, the disintegration of truth has been the only means for the search of truth, which albeit constantly evades exact identification. Such is the case with development of art since the 1940s. In a disjointed time, reality gets shattered and so does art. In the utopian universe, conceived and depicted in classical art, reality gets fragmented when it comes in contact with the real world. The period of modernity is a period of constant strife: between classes and communities, between coloniser and the colonised, between values, between nationalism and internationalism, between local and global, tradition and modernity, and so on and so forth. In this struggle for supremacy, a duality ensues not only in the world, but also within the individual being. This duality generates a tension, which turns to be the source of fragmentation. And as it turns out, fragmentation seems to be the inevitable fate of modernity. Young painter Aloke Kumar Paul conceives his vision of an ideal world in the current series, entitled Shades of Enlightenment, where 20 of his recent paintings in mixed media are on view. His works show his quest for his roots and how he tries to connect his art with the sojourns of our neo-Indian school.                  Event: Aloke Pauls solo exhibition of paintings: Shades of Enlightenment When: Till October 14; 4 pm - 8 pm Where: Studio Aloke, 1/4, Shahid Nagar, Dhakuria, Calcutta 700 031

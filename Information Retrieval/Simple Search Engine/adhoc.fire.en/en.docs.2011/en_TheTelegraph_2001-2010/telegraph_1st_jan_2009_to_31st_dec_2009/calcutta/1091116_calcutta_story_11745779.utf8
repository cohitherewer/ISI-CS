                      Region of turbulence                    Since post-colonial India has been ever-willing to create new states to fulfil the aspirations of battling ethnicities, the quest for an ethnic homeland and insurgent radicalism as a means to achieve it has become the familiar political grammar of the ethnic groups of the Northeast. Insurgencies thus never quite stop in this part of the country, even though insurgents do. Phizo faded away to make way for a Muivah in the Naga rebel space, but soon there was a Khaplang to challenge the latter. If Dasarath Dev became a Member of Parliament from the tribal guerrilla bases of Tripura, there was a Bijoy Hrangkhawl to take his place in the jungle. Later, when Hrangkhawl called it a day after 10 years of bloodshed, the Ranjit and Biswamohan Debbarma were ready to replace him. Even in Mizoram, where no Mizo rebel leader took to the jungles after the 1986 accord, smaller ethnic groups like the Brus and the Hmars took to armed struggle in the last two decades, looking to assert their political sovereignty. Through the last six decades, as the same action has been played out state after state, successive Indian governments tried to nationalise the political space in the Northeast by pushing ahead with efforts to include them in the mainstream. Yet, the struggling ethnicities of the region continued to challenge the nation-building processes, stretching the limits of constitutional politics. But these ethnic groups also fought amongst themselves, often as viciously as they fought India, drawing daggers over scarce resources and conflicting visions of homelands. Subir Bhaumik discusses these problems even beyond their political ramifications in his book Troubled Periphery: Crisis of Indias North East. To be launched this evening by Mark Tully, followed by a discussion on the book. Hosted by British Council.

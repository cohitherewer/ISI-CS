The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cops deny final farewell
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Cops deny final farewell
  - Son cremated as parents search          PRONAB MONDAL                           Sambhu Dass mother Shefali fights back her tears for the son she and her husband couldnt bid a last goodbye to because of cops callousness. Picture by Sanat Kr Sinha    (Below) Sambhu Das                                              
	An elderly couples search for their missing son has culminated in the cruel revelation that he was found dead a shout away from home and yet cremated as an unidentified body because the local cops didnt bother to even turn the page of a register, leave alone launch a probe.        
	Like Punit and Rashi Horo, and Deepankar and Joyita Sen Gupta before them, Sambhu Dass parents Jadupati and Shefali had filed a missing diary and done the rounds of the local police station and Lalbazar for weeks even as their son lay in a morgue and callous cops slept on the probe.        
	Jadupati, a housing complex guard, had lodged the missing diary with Burtolla police station on November 3, little knowing that his 28-year-old son had become a hit-and-run victim 300 metres from their home on Goabagan Street, in north Calcutta, the night before.        
	The duty officer of the police station had recorded the accident in the register to which a missing diary with information matching the accident victims description was added the next day. But no officer bothered flipping the page once to tally information about the accident victim with the details of the missing person.         
	Sambhus body was kept in the police morgue for 12 days and cremated as an unidentified one on November 15 while his elderly parents shuttled between Burtolla police station and Lalbazar.        
	By the time they learnt of their sons death, two days had elapsed since the cremation of the then unidentified body.         
	A basic probe would have revealed that the accident victim whose body was found at night and the youth mentioned in the missing diary the next day was the same person. How can the police be so callous? asked Sambhus younger brother Amit.        
	But the officer-in-charge of Burtolla police station, Shanti Prasad Roy, claimed his team wasnt at fault.        
	What happened is unfortunate but I dont think we erred. A probe is not as simplistic as collating sheaves of records. Sometimes the available information matches and a case is cracked, but not every time, he told Metro.        
	Mother Shefali said she and her husband had first visited Lalbazar to find out whether Sambhu had been arrested for any offence. We were told that nobody matching Sambhus description was in custody and were advised to get in touch with the missing persons squad, she recalled.         
	When the police sought a photograph of Sambhu, Jadupati couldnt find any at home. He finally procured one from the family of his late daughter-in-law Mamoni, who died two years ago leaving behind a son who is now seven. On November 17, Jadupati went to Lalbazar to hand over the picture. The missing persons squad contacted the police morgue near Md Ali Park, which confirmed that Sambhus picture matched that of a body cremated two days earlier.         
	It was the third instance in as many months of the police keeping the parents of a missing son or daughter in the dark about their fate. Punit and Rashi Horo of Taratala learnt last month that their daughter Rishensi Neha was found dead along a rail track and cremated as an unidentified body in July.         
	In September, engineering student Atish Sen Guptas parents Deepankar and Joyita learnt that their son was cremated as an unidentified body even as they ran from one law-enforcement unit to another for 24 days.

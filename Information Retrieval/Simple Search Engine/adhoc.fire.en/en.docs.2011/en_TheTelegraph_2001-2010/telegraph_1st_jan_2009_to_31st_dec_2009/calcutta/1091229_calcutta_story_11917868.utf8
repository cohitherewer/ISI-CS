The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cave-in at key crossing
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Cave-in at key crossing

	A 6ft x 10ft chunk of the Esplanade East-JL Nehru Road crossing caved in on Monday morning, raising questions about the maintenance of roads and the civic bodys reaction time.         
	Traffic policemen spotted the cave-in and alerted the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) around 8am after cordoning off the area.         
	Civic officials took more than five-and-a-half-hours to reach the spot and another hour and a half to understand the reason behind the subsidence.         
	Water leaking from an underground pipeline loosened the soil and caused the cave-in, said a CMC official overseeing the digging at the spot. Engineers of the civic drainage and sewage department reached the spot around 3pm.        
	Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya had his excuses ready. Monday was a holiday. Besides, several roads were closed for Muharram and a number of workers had joined the processions. Hence, we took time to send our teams to the spot. But once the officials detected the problem, restoration work started immediately.        
	Nilangshu Basu, the principal chief engineer (planning and development) of the CMC, told Metro that men from his department started digging the damaged part of the road and workers from the water supply department later took over.         
	We can work on the pipeline only at night when the water pressure is low. The repair work could take around three weeks, said Basu.         
	A senior traffic officer said vehicular movement along Esplanade East would be affected because of the restoration work.        
	We will have to deploy extra people to man traffic on this busy stretch till the repairs are completed, said the policeman.

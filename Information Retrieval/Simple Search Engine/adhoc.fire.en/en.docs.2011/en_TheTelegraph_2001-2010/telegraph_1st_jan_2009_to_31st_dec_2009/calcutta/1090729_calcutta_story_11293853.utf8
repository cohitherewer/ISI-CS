The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Twin arrests in LPG scam
                                                                                                               Twin arrests in LPG scam
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two men were arrested in BD block, Salt Lake, on Monday for illegally refilling LPG-run vehicles with gas meant for domestic consumption.        
	Dilip Das, one of the accused, ran a travel and tourism business from BD 445 where he lived as a tenant. A month ago, he started the illegal business of refilling LPG vehicles with gas from domestic cylinders. The other man arrested had come to refill his Maruti Omni, said a police officer.        
	The sleuths seized six LPG cylinders and two LPG-run Maruti Omnis that were brought for refilling.        
	We are trying to find out how he had managed to collect so many domestic cylinders and whether the LPG dealer concerned had any link with Das, the official added.        
	Neighbours said Das had been running the illegal refilling business for the past one-and-a-half months.         
	The locality stinks of LPG. We live in constant fear of an explosion resulting from a gas leak, said a resident. Block secretary Tapas Sinha Roy said: I had asked him several times to stop the illegal business but he ignored my plea.

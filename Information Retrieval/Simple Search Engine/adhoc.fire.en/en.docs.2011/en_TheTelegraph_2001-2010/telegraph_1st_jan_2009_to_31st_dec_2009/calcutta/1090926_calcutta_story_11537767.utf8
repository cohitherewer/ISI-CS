The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Patchwork path to pandals
                                                                                                               Patchwork path to pandals
          TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                          One of the patchwork spots in Behala which has to be negotiated before approaching a pandal                                  
	Jayasree Mullick got off a bus and was about to step on the pavement when the earth beneath her parted. Even before she could react, the 34-year-old found herself waist-deep in mud.        
	Welcome to Puja 2009 in Behala, where pandal-hoppers have to watch their steps every moment lest they suffer Jayasrees fate, thanks to shoddy patchwork by the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project (CEIP).        
	The pipe-laying work under CEIP was to be over before Puja. But it has overshot the deadline. Since we cannot work during Puja, the dug-up stretches were temporarily filled up by sand and rubbish, a CEIP official said requesting anonymity.        
	But how good was the fill-up? Ask Jayasree. I would have sunk further had not shopkeepers who witnessed the mishap come to my rescue, recalled the Thakurpukur resident, who has lodged a complaint with Behala police station and also the office of the local borough chairman.        
	Local residents said two more people had fallen into the ditch  now barricaded  right in front of the Federal Bank branch on Diamond Harbour Road.        
	The uneven patchwork is taking a toll on traffic, too. The patchwork extends to half of the western flank of Diamond Harbour Road, forcing us to route all vehicles through a single file. This is creating a bottleneck on the artery, said an officer of the traffic department.        
	It is taking around an hour to cover just 1.5km, between Behala Sakherbazar and the tram depot, said Debabrata Mukherjee, a resident.        
	We had warned the civic body about the mess but officials assured us about proper patchwork. They even said the entire width of Diamond Harbour Road could be opened to traffic, said a police officer.        
	CEIP project director Soumya Ganguly said: The road has repaired in the best possible manner. I have asked my officials to reinforce the landfill by dumping sandbags.        
	Weather: Saptami was dry except for a few spells of rain but the Met office has warned of scattered rain and thundershowers on Ashtami. The city on Friday received 9.4mm of rain (in 24 hours till 5.30pm). A low-pressure area is likely to form in the next 48 hours over the Bay. If it happens, there could be a washout on Sunday and Monday, said a weather official said from Pune.        
	With inputs from Meghdeep Bhattacharyya

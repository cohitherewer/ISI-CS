                                                                                                               Affair whiff in youth shooting
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A 21-year-old electrician was shot in the neck on Tuesday afternoon by a man allegedly hired by his fathers boss for pursuing his married daughter.        
	The shooter and his two accomplices fled the premises before the sparse crowd on platform No. 3 of Ramrajatala station could react. Saswata Senapati was bleeding profusely but managed to call up his brother on his cellphone.        
	He and one of their neighbours in Jagachha took Saswata on a cycle rickshaw to a nursing home near the station. He was immediately shifted to SSKM Hospital. Officials said his condition on Tuesday was critical but stable. Doctors are trying to determine if the bullet is lodged in the neck.        
	In his complaint to Shalimar GRP, Saswatas father Ranjit alleged that the manager of the factory where he worked had threatened the youth with dire consequences if he did not sever links with his 18-year-old daughter.        
	The girl, who married last year, had shifted from her parents place in Bakra, Nayabaz, had to her uncles house in Uluberia. Some of their neighbours said that the youth used to stop the girl on the streets and try to speak to her.        
	We have started an investigation into the incident. We will question Saswata Senapati after he recovers. We will also interrogate the manager of the factory, said the officer-in-charge of Shalimar GRP, Subhas Jana.        
	According to the GRP, Saswata had taken a Panskura local from Howrah station on Monday afternoon. The three men, one of whom shot at the youth, boarded the compartment at Dasnagar station. The trio were engaged in an altercation with Saswata. At one point, they had even come to blows.        
	When Saswata got off at Ramrajatala, the men followed. One of them fished out a gun and pumped a bullet into the youths neck from close range, said a GRP officer. Ranjit said Saswata was on his way home.         
	The two had met about five years ago while Saswata was visiting his father at the factory. Their relationship continued till the girl got married, said neighbours.        
	Jail escape: Biswajit Ghosh, who had been arrested by Barasat police on Monday for theft, fled from Barasat District Hospital around 8.30pm on Tuesday. Ghosh complained of respiratory problems in the police lock-up and was admitted to the male ward of the hospital on Monday evening.

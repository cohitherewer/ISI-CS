The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Private hand to heal healthcare
                                                                                                               Private hand to heal healthcare
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Partnership summit: Bhattacharjee                                  
	The paperwork for starting a public-private partnership to improve the quality of services in state-run hospitals is in the final stages, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said on Wednesday.        
	Laying the foundation stone for a nursing college and paramedical training facility at Rajpur, in South 24-Parganas, Bhattacharjee conceded that the picture of government healthcare in West Bengal was not all rosy, especially in at the village, block and sub-division levels.        
	There are areas where we can improve. I spoke to health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra and we decided to enter into public-private partnerships, said Bhattacharjee, who was accompanied by MP Sujan Chakraborty, land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Molla and Sunderbans affairs minister Kanti Ganguly.        
	The chief minister, however, asked well-off people to get treated at private hospitals so that the state-run hospitals could serve the poor better.        
	We hear a lot about the healthcare facilities in Kerala. On a recent visit, I found that private institutions formed the pillars of healthcare in Kerala, he added.        
	The nursing college and paramedical training facility at Rajpur is an extension of the Asia Heart Foundation, which is housed in Devi Shettys Rabindranath Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences in Mukundapur, on the eastern fringes.        
	The college, which is expected to become operational in 2012, aims at churning out 1,500 paramedical professionals and nurses each year.         
	The healthcare industry is growing fast and there will be a huge demand for paramedics. Most of the qualified nurses come from Kerala, but we want Calcutta to take that place, said Shetty.         
	Apart from a course on nursing, the college will offer 40 other programmes.

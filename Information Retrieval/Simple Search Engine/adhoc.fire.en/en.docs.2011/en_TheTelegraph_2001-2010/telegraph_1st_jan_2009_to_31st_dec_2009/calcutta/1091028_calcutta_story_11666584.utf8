	A truck parked illegally on BT Road, in front of the Indian Statistical Institute campus, caught fire from a stove after it was hit from behind by another goods carrier on Tuesday morning. A cyclist got caught between the two vehicles and suffered multiple injuries.        
	The driver of the parked truck, who had fled the mishap spot, was arrested hours later.        
	The mishap occurred four days after the high court set the government a 15-day deadline to file a status report on illegal parking and pavement encroachments in parts of the city.        
	Police said the driver and helper of the illegally parked truck were cooking in the cabin around 10.20am when a cement-laden carrier rammed into it while trying to overtake a car.        
	The stove on which the duo were cooking fell, setting the truck on fire. Tapas Samanta, a casual employee of ISI who was cycling down the road, got caught between the two trucks and suffered injuries on his hands and head, said P.K. Tripathi, the additional superintendent of police, Barrackpore. We are looking for the other driver.        
	Three fire tenders took more than 40 minutes to douse the blaze.        
	The mishap sparked protests by local residents and employees of ISI, who held up traffic on BT Road for a couple of hours. There has been no crackdown on illegal parking despite repeated complaints, said Achintya Talukdar, a local resident.        
	An officer of North 24-Parganas police said parking was banned on BT Road near the ISI campus because of security reasons.        
	ISI officials met the police and demanded installation of No Parking boards and automatic signalling system, and round-the-clock traffic surveillance.        
	An officer of Baranagar police said: We will request our seniors to designate the 300m stretch of BT Road, between Bon Hooghly and the ISI campus, a no-parking zone.

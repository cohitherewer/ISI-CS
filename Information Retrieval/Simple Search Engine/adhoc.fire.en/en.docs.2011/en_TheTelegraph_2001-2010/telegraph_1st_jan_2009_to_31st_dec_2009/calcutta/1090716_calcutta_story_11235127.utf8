                      The master and his art                    Recognised not only as a painter, muralist and printmaker but also as a scholar and teacher of art, K.G. Subramanyan is a multi-faceted artist in the true sense of the term. A prolific writer, scholar, teacher and art historian, he uses his in-depth knowledge of various artistic traditions to create fantastical images of wit and eroticism that are universal in their appeal, yet coupled with iconic symbols drawn from Indian legends and folklore. He has also achieved in his works a successful synthesis of Indias linear folk tradition and modernism. His sense of design, especially the manner in which he plays with pictorial space by filling the entire surface with Indian fauna and flora, makes his paintings vibrant and rooted in Indian spirit. He is among the few artists who have explored the possibilities of modern art from a different perspective, giving new dimensions to the human figure by making them appear more as characters from various myths and traditional narratives, populating a composition quite to the contrary. As an artist he is extraordinarily versatile, cherishing the facility to work in diverse media, sizes and techniques over a stylistic conformity to a single medium, genre, size, technique or manner of visualisation. K.G. Subramanyan: Recent Works, the ongoing shows of his paintings, are being hosted in celebration of his 85th birthday. Showcasing a new collection, they feature works done on canvas, reverse paintings, gouaches on paper and terracotta works.                  Event: An exhibition of art works by K.G.

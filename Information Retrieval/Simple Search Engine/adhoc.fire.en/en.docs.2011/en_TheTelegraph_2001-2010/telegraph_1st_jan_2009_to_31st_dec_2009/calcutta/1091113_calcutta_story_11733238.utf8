                                                                            Friday , November 13 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Meteor magic on Nov 17
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A month after the Diwali fireworks, an astronomical display will light up the night sky on November 17. The Leonid meteor shower, one of the most prominent meteor showers, will be visible in the city and peak around 3am on November 18, say astronomers.         
	This year, people of Asia and parts of eastern Europe are expected to get a spectacular view of the phenomenon. In 2008, the US offered the best view of the phenomenon.         
	The meteor shower can be viewed from anywhere in Calcutta where there is open space and the night sky is clear, said Debiprosad Duari, the director (research and academics) of MP Birla Planetarium.         
	Meteors are bright streaks of light visible in the night sky, commonly known as shooting stars. They occur when rocky particles  which can be as small as a speck of dust  enter the earths atmosphere at tremendous speed and produce a streak of light because of friction.         
	The shower predicted for November 17 was named Leonid as the meteors will appear to emanate from a region in the Leo constellation.         
	City sky gazers can find the Leo constellation rising from the north-eastern horizon at 10.45pm close to Mars on November 17 night. The shower is expected to be visible from 1am and peak between 3.04am and 3.14am.         
	There will be no moon on November 17 night and the dark sky should offer a clear view of Leonid. It is safe to watch a meteor shower with naked eyes, said Duari.         
	He warned that timings predicted for meteor showers may sometimes be off the mark and enthusiasts need to be patient.

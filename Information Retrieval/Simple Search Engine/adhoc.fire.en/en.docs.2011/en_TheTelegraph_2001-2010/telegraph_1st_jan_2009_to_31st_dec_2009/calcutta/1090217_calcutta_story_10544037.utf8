The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hospital ransack over kid deaths
                                                                                                               Hospital ransack over kid deaths
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Three deaths in two hours led to mob violence on Monday morning at BC Roy Memorial Hospital for Children on Narkeldanga Main Road.        
	Seven-year-old Sumana Kumir, three-month-old Muhammad and a 12-day-old boy died between 4.45am and 6.30am.        
	At 8am, relatives of the deceased and other patients gathered at the reception and broke glass panes and furniture, alleging that no senior doctor had attended to the kids. The situation was brought under control by police.        
	The hospital denied the charge, saying the kids had died of natural causes.         
	Hospital superintendent M.K. Chatterjee said Sumana had been suffering from aplastic anaemia while Muhammad had pneumonia and septicaemia.         
	The newborn, who was premature and had septicaemia, was operated upon last week. He couldnt recover from the surgery, he added.        
	The doctors had killed my child. Senior doctors dont attend to patients, leaving junior doctors to play with their lives, said the babys father, 24-year-old Ujwal Dutta.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Techie wife fought killers
                                                                                                               Techie wife fought killers
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Sushmita Biswass courage to take on her attackers proved fatal for her.        
	The 33-year-old grabbed one of the two goons who had stormed her parental home in Sinthee on Saturday night, prompting the other to stab her in an attempt to free his accomplice, police said on Sunday.        
	The sleuths tried to reconstruct the events leading to Sushmitas death on the basis of the post-mortem report, which suggested the homemaker had given a tough fight to her assailants before being stabbed in the abdomen.        
	The bruise marks on her hands show she did not give up when the two killers were dragging her, said an officer investigating the case.        
	The duo had come looking for Sushmitas cousin Krishnendu, who they claimed had defaulted on a loan he had taken from them. They turned on the woman, who has left behind a 19-month-old girl and her software engineer husband, when she said Krishnendu no longer lived there.        
	The cops questioned Krishnendu on Sunday. He has of late become friends with people who do not have good reputation, the officer said.

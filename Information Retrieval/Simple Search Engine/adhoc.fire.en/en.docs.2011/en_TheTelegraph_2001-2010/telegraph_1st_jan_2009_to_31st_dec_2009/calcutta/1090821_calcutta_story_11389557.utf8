          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 25-year-old lawyer of the high court was arrested on Thursday morning for allegedly making obscene gestures at women home guards of the city police.        
	Sankha Subhra Kundu, a resident of New Santoshpur, has been booked under IPC sections 354 (intent to outrage the modesty of a woman) and 509 (insult the modesty of a woman). Both sections being bailable, Kundu was released on interim bail.        
	Police said Kundu was picked up from in front of the basketball court of the police club on the Maidan.        
	Women home guards stated in their complaint that Kundu would visit the area on his motorcycle every morning for the past month and make obscene gestures at them, said an officer of Maidan police station.        
	On Thursday morning, a few home guards and their coach caught Kundu as soon as he got off his two-wheeler and handed him over to the police.        
	Cops said Kundu had been practising in the high court for the past year.

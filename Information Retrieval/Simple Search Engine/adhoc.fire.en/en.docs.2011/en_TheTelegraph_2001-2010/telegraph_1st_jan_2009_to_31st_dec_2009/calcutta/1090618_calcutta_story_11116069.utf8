The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Killer crossroads at crack of dawn
                                                                                                               Killer crossroads at crack of dawn
                                              
	A 28-year-old marine engineer and the driver of the taxi he was travelling in died when the vehicle collided with a state bus at the Red Road roundabout in front of the Fort William main gate around 5.45am on June 8. Cops said both vehicles were speeding and described the roundabout as a death trap in the early hours of the day. Metro checked out the free-for-all at seven key intersections in the city early last Saturday         
	5.10am        
	Place: Belvedere Road-AJC Bose Road crossing        
	What we saw: Speeding vehicles plying between Kidderpore and AJC Bose Road pose a danger to vehicles coming from Bhowanipore and Alipore. The signals glow amber on all sides and goods vehicles zoom past.        
	A taxi coming from the Alipore side dropped a passenger opposite Police Training School (PTS). Then, rather than taking a U-turn from the next crossing, it changed direction at the crossing itself, driving down the wrong lane. It barely missed a car coming from the opposite direction. There was no cop in sight.        
	5.25am        
	Place: AJC Bose Road crossing (opposite PTS)        
	What we saw: One of the busiest crossings in the city, the spot is also the most accident-prone in the early hours. Vehicles flouting rules are common. Two-wheelers are the worst offenders, and many riders dont wear helmets.        
	Morning walkers, common in this part of the city, run the risk of getting hit.         
	Heavy vehicles hurtle through with no regard for traffic rules.        
	5.40am         
	Place: Hospital Road-Kidderpore Road crossing        
	What we saw: Part of the road is taken over by morning walkers and fitness fanatics. But they are at great risk of being run over as vehicles go zip zap zoom on the empty road at this time of the day.        
	The vehicles are plying on the other side of the road, argued Sheikh Mehboob Alam, busy stretching on the road.        
	Its illegal to stand on a carriageway and exercise. Besides, such behaviour defies common sense, said a senior traffic cop.              
	5.50am        
	Place: JK Island, opposite the main gate of Fort William        
	What we saw: No traffic personnel could be seen at the crossing, though the roundabout is one of the 48 crossings where police are supposed to run extra vigil on vehicular movement beyond traffic hours.        
	Vehicles heading for Hospital Road and Kidderpore from Red Road and Outram Road dont follow signals and run the risk of hitting Park Street-bound vehicles.        
	I havent seen a single cop here in the past 15 years, said Rajiv Sewak, a regular morning jogger on Red Road.              
	6.05am        
	Place: Park Street crossing (near the Metro station)        
	What we saw: A minibus on the Naktala-Howrah route rammed into a taxi heading towards Esplanade. The signal on the taxis route glowed green and it started moving when suddenly the minibus, which was coming from Howrah, jumped the lights and collided with the taxi, smashing the left side of its bonnet. Taxi driver Om Praksh Shaw was injured and bus driver Bappa Das was arrested.        
	Such incidents are becoming common in the morning because buses generally dont follow traffic rules, said a constable at the crossing.        
	S.I. Kayal, a resident of Elliot Road, who goes to the Maidan on his motorcycle every morning, said he has seen 20 accidents at crossings in the area over the years.              
	6.25am        
	Place: Park Circus seven-point crossing        
	What we Saw: Autorickshaws plying on the Esplanade-Park Circus-Lohapool route rule the roost. They can be seen driving recklessly and skipping signals to pick up passengers.        
	One auto jumped a red light, giving the drivers of vehicles coming from the other direction a scare. A police van was spotted at the crossing, but the cops kept sitting inside.              
	6.45am        
	Place: Ballygunge Phari        
	What we Saw: Speeding cars that jump signal and flout traffic rules in the morning are common at this busy intersection. The temple near the Phari draws devotees in the morning, who are at risk of being run over.              
	Policespeak: With the volume of traffic less in the early hours, drivers tend to accelerate, resulting in fatal accidents. Also, most crossings are unmanned early in the morning, which emboldens rogue drivers to flout traffic rules, said a senior traffic cop.        
	Dilip Banerjee, the deputy commissioner of police (traffic), said the traffic department conducts a study every month to ascertain accident-prone zones in the city. We deploy our men accordingly curb accidents on those stretches, he said.                    GUNEET SINGH CHADHA

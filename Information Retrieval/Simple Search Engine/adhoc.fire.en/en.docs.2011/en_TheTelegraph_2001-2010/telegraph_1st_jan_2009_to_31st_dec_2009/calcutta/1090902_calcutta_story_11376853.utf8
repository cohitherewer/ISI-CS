The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Canal bank project to boost fruit supply
                                                                                                               Canal bank project to boost fruit supply
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                                      
	The civic body has started planting trees along drainage canals to increase fruit production in the city and prevent erosion of banks.         
	The Rs 1.28crore Green Belt Project, a part of the Rs 1,800crore Calcutta Environment Improvement Project funded by Asian Development Bank, is expected to increase the supply of seasonal fruits to the city market by at least 10,000 quintals from 2015.        
	The project is also aimed at preventing erosion of the canal banks, arresting environmental degradation and bringing about improvement in the quality of life in Calcutta, said a civic official.        
	The plantation of mango, lemon, jackfruit and coconut saplings started in the third week of July at Anandapur bus stand, on the banks of the 23km-long Tollygunge-Panchannagram (TP) Channel and will continue till September 2010.        
	Fruit trees will also be planted on the banks of Charial, Monikhali and Begor canals. Altogether, 41km on both banks of the four drainage channels will be covered under the Green Belt Project.        
	If 70 per cent of the saplings survive, an additional 10,000 quintals of fruits will hit the city markets every year from 2015. We can call it a spin-off effect of the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.        
	A nursery in Ranaghat and an engineering firm have been entrusted with executing the project. Besides planting trees, they will bore tubewells, construct sheds and fences.        
	According to Biswajit Ghosh, an official of the nursery, the trees will start bearing fruit within four years of being planted.        
	Medicinal plants like Basak, Aswagandha, Sarpagandha, Aloe vera, Anantamul and Satamuli will also be cultivated on small patches on the canal banks.        
	A spokesperson for the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project said the nursery would look after the saplings till 2012 and after that will hand over the upkeep of the plants to people from low income groups, NGOs, clubs and self-help groups.         
	Those looking after the plants will get a portion of the sales proceeds of fruits and other produce, said a civic official.        
	However, how the proceeds will be divided between the civic body and the caretakers is yet to be finalised, added the official.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Police on Friday remained clueless about engineering student Atish Sen Gupta, missing since last Sunday. Atish had rushed out of his Kasba home on August 30 after speaking to someone on the landline.         
	There has been no development in the case. We have questioned some of his friends and relatives but without much success, said S.K. Chowdhry, the additional superintendent of police (industrial), South 24-Parganas.        
	The family, however, accused the cops of slackness in handling the case. The police just keep asking us for more information, said Atishs father Dipankar Sen Gupta.         
	The family members have obtained the phone number of the friend Atish spoke to before leaving. Atish called up Satadru Biswas, one of his friends who lives in Naihati, and spoke for over 26 minutes. As he was about to hang up, our help heard him saying: Accha tui rakh ami ekhuni aschi (You hang up, Im reaching right away), Dipankar said.         
	The call records of Atish revealed that he would talk for long hours with Satadru and another friend, Niladri. Atish had met both at a tutorial.        
	Satadru and his mother visited Atishs home late on Thursday. The family informed the police and they took Satadru to Kasba police station. We have questioned him for over two hours but found nothing suspicious. Satadru said they discussed studies, said an officer. Satadru was released later in the night.        
	Cops said that according to Satadru, Atish hung up saying he had some work and had to leave. We have asked Satadru not to leave the city without informing us, the officer said.        
	The family members said they have found some suspicious scraps on Atishs Orkut profile and have informed the police about them.

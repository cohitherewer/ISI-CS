The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | New Market fire scare
                                                                                                               New Market fire scare
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A fire broke out on the terrace of a mosque between the new and old complexes of New Market on Thursday afternoon.        
	The fibre ceiling of the mosque  known as New Market Masjid  was gutted but the structure was not damaged.         
	Five tenders took almost 45 minutes to douse the flames.        
	The fire originated from sparks emitted during a welding work on the ceiling of the mosque. The shops in the market were not damaged nor was anyone injured, said an officer of the West Bengal Fire and Emergency Services.        
	The flames were spotted around 3.45pm. Traders tried to keep the fire under control by spraying water and using extinguishers before the tenders arrived.        
	We noticed thick black smoke billowing out of the market complex and thought a shop had caught fire. On rushing to the source of the smoke we saw the terrace of the mosque in flames, said Mohammed Mushtaq, who owns a leather goods shop in the new complex.         
	The incident reminded many traders of the fire that raged through the market in 1985. A large part of the market was rebuilt later.         
	Lindsay Street and Bertram Street were closed after Thursdays blaze, resulting in snarls on SN Banerjee Road, Free School Street, JL Nehru Road and other areas in central Calcutta.

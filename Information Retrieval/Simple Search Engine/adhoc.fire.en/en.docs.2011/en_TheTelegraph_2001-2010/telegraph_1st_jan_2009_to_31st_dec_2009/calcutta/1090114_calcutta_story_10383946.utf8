                      All about colour, space and form                    Any work of art serves a dual purpose: it is the physical beauty that catches the beholders eyes instantly and on a more metaphysical level, a work of art gives a sense of psychological and spiritual fulfilment. This is relevant in the case of abstract art in general, and particularly in the softly luminous, compellingly illusionistic organic abstractions of Deepak Tandon whose exhibition of paintings, photographs and video art, sEe, is based on individual perceptions. In his paintings, Tandon combines the formal qualities of abstract art while expressing and articulating the desire for its metaphysical significance. He is very assertive in his quest for fundamental truth and beauty. One gets a sense of the inevitability and incomprehensibility of the natural order through these works, something which is further underscored by the incorporation of hallucinatory impressions of movement. It articulates a visual counterpoint, but one that does not force the eye to fluctuate. The quality and nature of Tandons content are determined entirely by inner compulsions. This alone justifies and accounts for his forms which are, after all, articulations of internal resonances. Thus, the colours and forms are simultaneously tranquil and turbulent; filled with a sense of pathos which is sensitive and touching. In the midst of all this, the metallic tones mitigate the drama of the scene and strike a more sensual, perhaps even slightly opulent, chord. Fundamentally, in formal terms, his art is about the relationship between colour, space and form in which shifting levels of luminosity and varying surface textures create a sense of undulating tempo in which the forms vibrate.                  Event: sEe  Deepak Tandons solo exhibition of paintings, photographs and video art When: Till tomorrow; 11 am - 7 pm Where: Ganges Art Gallery, 33A Jatin Das Road

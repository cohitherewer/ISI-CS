                                                                                                               HC prods battery auto
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Monday directed the government to allow conversion of a two-stroke autorickshaw to battery mode. The private firm doing the switchover would send the three-wheeler to the Automotive Research Association of India to ascertain its feasibility, the court added.        
	The conversion, by Tara International, has to be done within three months and the Delhi-based associations report submitted to the court within another three months.        
	According to environment experts, two-stroke autos are the primary source of the citys vehicular pollution.        
	The Automotive Research Association of India will find out how safe the battery-run auto will be and whether it would consume fossil fuel, said Justice Sanjib Banerjee.        
	The order was passed on a petition by Tara International which claims to have invented a technology for converting two-stroke autos into battery-powered vehicles.        
	Once converted, the autos will not pollute the environment or consume fossil fuel, submitted Soumen Sen, the companys lawyer.        
	Sen said that in December 2008, the firm had made presentations on the project to the Centre and the state government.        
	The state is yet to react. The Centre has green-signalled battery-powered autos but hasnt clarified whether existing two-stroke autos can be given the option to convert, Sen said.        
	Justice Banerjee asked advocate-general Balai Ray why the state did not consider the petitioners proposal.        
	The Regional Transport Authority does not have the infrastructure to ascertain the feasibility of the project, Ray replied.        
	The bench then asked the state to allow Tara International to convert one auto to battery mode as a test case.        
	Anumita Roy Choudhury, of the Centre for Science and Environment, told Metro: A few factory-fitted battery autos ply in Bangalore and Delhi but no running auto has been converted to the battery mode.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A youth stabbed his phone friend at her Sonarpur house on Sunday afternoon and was bashed up by her relatives. Both have been admitted to hospital  the girl has been operated on  and are out of danger.        
	The family of Anamika Das (name changed), a Class XII student, has lodged a complaint against Vikas Banka with Sonarpur police station. Banka, 22, is from Madhya Pradesh and has been staying in a rented flat in Howrah.         
	He works with a private firm and also studies in a private college.        
	Police said Anamika met Banka for the first time on Sunday  the duo have been conversing over the phone since December  when her family invited him for lunch.        
	According to the familys complaint, Banka suddenly stabbed Anamika on her back with a kitchen knife. We heard Anamikas screams and then saw the youth leaving the house with a blood-stained knife. I grabbed him. Anamikas family members later beat him up, said Tarapada Chowdhury, a neighbour.        
	Perhaps he had proposed to Anamika and she refused. That might have prompted him to attack her, said a police officer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Duo held for assault
                                                                                                               Duo held for assault
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Mokim Khan and his friend Syed Zeeshan were arrested for beating up a bus driver in central Calcutta on Friday.        
	A private bus on the Esplanade-Barasat route hit a Hyundai Accent, owned by Khan, from behind near the Alimuddin Street-AJC Bose Road crossing at 3pm. Khan, who was at the wheel, got off along with Zeeshan and dragged bus driver Majnu Mandal, 37, out of the vehicle and beat him up.        
	The duo kicked and punched him and smashed his head against a wall. The driver was bleeding profusely but traffic cops just looked on, said a witness. Local residents and passengers of the bus rescued Mandal and handed the duo to Park Street police.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | One injured in school balcony collapse 
                                                                                                               One injured in school balcony collapse 
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The broken portion of the balcony. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                  
	A portion of the first-floor balcony of a north Calcutta school came crashing down on Thursday, injuring a Class VI student who was standing on it.        
	The incident occurred around 10am in Mohammed Jan Higher Secondary School, off Zakaria Street. The student, Aftab Alam, was taken to Medical College and Hospital. After treatment, the school authorities sent him to his Khardah home in an ambulance.        
	Around 10am, Aftab went to the balcony to fetch water. Suddenly we heard a scream and some of Aftabs classmates rushed to the school office shouting that the balcony had caved in, said Mohammed Alamgir, the headmaster.         
	Aftab escaped without serious injuries as he fell on a garbage pile. The incident has left the boy in a state of shock.        
	I was standing on the balcony when suddenly I felt myself falling. Before I could grab at something to save myself, I landed on a garbage heap with injuries on my arms and legs, recounted a dazed Alam, sitting in the MRI scanning centre of the hospital.        
	The school is a private institution built on wakf property. According to director-general (building) Gorachand Mondol, the civic building department had issued a notice in December 2008 declaring the building unsafe. Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay had ordered the demolition of the unsafe parts of the building.        
	The accident generated resentment among guardians. If the boy had fallen from the second floor he might have died, said Parvez Alam, a guardian. He pointed out that nearly 1,500 children studied in the four-storey building, which is over 70 years old. Three months back a chunk of plaster fell off the roof. Fortunately no one was injured, he added.        
	The school authorities admitted such accidents might recur but said raising funds for repairs was a problem.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sit-in shadow on CU rating
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Sit-in shadow on CU rating

	Calcutta University officials are losing sleep over the possibility of protests by students and employees on the campus affecting the institutions five-star rating when it comes up for review this week.        
	A team from the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) is set to start its inspection from Monday against the backdrop of demonstrations over various issues, including one last Friday to highlight the alleged lack of security in hostels.        
	The possibility of us getting a low score this time cannot be ruled out given the situation. But we are helplesswe cant stop people from protesting if they have a grievance. The only solution is to properly explain the universitys stand on these protests, a senior official said.        
	Government funding of universities and colleges depends largely on their NAAC ratings, which are awarded after much scrutiny. Campus unrest can come in the way of a university being downgraded for failing to maintain a proper ambience.        
	We are worried because a lower NAAC rating than what we were awarded five years ago will not only affect our reputation but also impact funding by government agencies like the University Grants Commission, the official said.        
	Calcutta University received the highest rating of five stars the very first time it was evaluated by the NAAC five years ago.         
	The NAAC has since introduced a new system under which institutions are graded A, B or C instead of being awarded stars.        
	An eight-member NAAC team is scheduled to visit all seven campuses of the university from Monday to Thursday to review whether it has improved, stagnated or fallen a notch in the past five years.        
	Pro vice-chancellor Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee said he was confident about the university maintaining its standing despite the protests.         
	 The university has made outstanding progress in academics, particularly in research. We are sure that our academic achievements outnumber our lapses, he added.         
	The universitys administrative campus, on College Street, has witnessed unrest over the past 10 days         
	A few hundred BA and BSc Part-I and Part-II examinees have been holding sit-in demonstrations since Monday to protest below-par exam results.         
	Nearly 100 casual employees from a Trinamul Congress-backed union had also started an indefinite agitation last week demanding permanent jobs.         
	The protest was suspended after officials requested Trinamul Congress leaders to get the protesters to back off till the NAAC inspection was over.

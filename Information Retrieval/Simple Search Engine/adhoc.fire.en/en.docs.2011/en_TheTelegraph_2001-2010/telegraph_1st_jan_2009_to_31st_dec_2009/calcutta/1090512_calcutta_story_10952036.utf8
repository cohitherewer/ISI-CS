	Marriages made by mouse  
	Kharagpur B-school portal to help fix weddings  
	Students of Vinod Gupta School of Management (VGSOM) at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur, have tapped into the great Indian wedding carnival for their debut entrepreneurial venture.        
	Mohammad Athar, Akshat Mohindra, Hima T.K. and Pradyumna Mahajani, students of the graduating batch of 2009, have started a marriage logistics portal that will help with the nitty-gritty of arranging a marriage.        
	A friend of ours faced a lot of lot of trouble organising his marriage recently. This gave us the idea of creating a platform that will be a one-stop information point for those tying the knot, said Akshat.        
	The website, called shaadieasy.com, will provide prospective brides and grooms with information on everything from marriage halls, caterers, card printers, car rentals, sweet shops to bridal and groom wear, florists, tents and videographers.        
	It will be ideal for people who do not have the time to visit more than one venue or compare prices, said Akshat.        
	Launched on May 5, the site allows one to compare prices and to set up appointments with the service providers.        
	The students conceptualised the venture during their final semester. They were helped by the Science and Technology Entrepreneurs Park at IIT Kharagpur.         
	The venture is self-funded now, as the costs are limited to website development and data collection. Apart from Calcutta, information listings are available for Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai, Bangalore and Hyderabad. Even though we will move to separate cities for our jobs, we will continue the venture, said Akshat.        
	Chandreyee Chatterjee                        THE ROAD AHEAD: Students of La Martiniere for Girls start the trek from Auli towards Garson Bugyal                    
	Snow, chill amp; Steep TREK        
	tTemperatures below -7 degrees Celsius, tents covered in snow and negotiating steep paths barely more than a foot wide, these were some of the challenges 11 students from La Martiniere for Girls had to brave on their way to Baby Pangarchula, a 4328m (approximate) peak in the Garhwal Himalayas in Uttarakhand.         
	It was undertaken as part of the adventure sport requirement for the International Award for Young People, that gives students from 14 to 25 years the chance to explore their skills. The trip, from April 2 to 12, included many firsts for the girls, whose previous experience of the mountains was limited to a trek on the far easier Sandakphu in West Bengal.         
	The group began the journey from Auli. Of the 44 who set off on the trip, 11 returned to Joshimath, unable to cope with the falling temperature and the high altitude, while the rest undertook a trekking programme from Khulara to the approximately 4165 metre-high Kuari Pass, an arduous trek considered almost as tough as a peak-climbing expedition. The expense per head was Rs 11,000.        
	Temperatures began dropping from Khulara, when it would snow through the night. We were caught in a snowstorm midway between Garson Bugyal and Khulara, recalled Class XII student Ahona Palchowdhury.         
	We left a few tents and sleeping bags at the camp site in Khulara in our hurry to leave, she added.         
	It was a hard lesson in responsibility. The girls learnt not to take basic necessities like fire and water for granted. We realised that we had to keep the fire burning as the wood would get damp, otherwise. There was no fresh water on the higher reaches. We saved every drop, she said.         
	Though this was not the first trek for most, it certainly was the toughest. Our feet became numb walking through knee-deep snow. Hard as it was to negotiate the snow on the way up, it was doubly difficult while coming down, as the ground had become slippery. It is easy to lose ones footing and plunge into the depths below, said Tirumala Banerjee. My heart skipped a beat when one of my friends slid down a few feet, though the instructors caught her, she added.        
	Sleep was intermittent in the intense cold and they negotiated steep stretches only a foot wide. We looked straight ahead as we were too scared to look at the fall below, said Nikhita Gandhi.        
	Such trips change the attitude of children. They become more responsible after facing adverse situations. It also helps build leadership qualities, said Joydeep Ghosal, the expedition coordinator, International Award for Young People.         
	Students of The Heritage School, Birla High School for Girls and Boys are next in line for a trek as part of the award.

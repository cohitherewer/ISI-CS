The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Besu convenes top body after four-year slumber
                                                                                                               Besu convenes top body after four-year slumber
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          The Besu campus. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) on Wednesday held the first meeting of the court, its highest policy-making body, more than four years after being upgraded to a university.        
	The court is an elected body comprising Besu students, teachers and other employees, and representatives of the state education board and the education department.        
	The main topic discussed on Wednesday was the formation of a three-member search committee that would name three candidates for the post of vice-chancellor within a month. The tenure of the incumbent, N.R. Banerjea, ends on February 28.         
	A fortnight ago, the government had asked Besu to convene a meeting of its court by January 14 and set up a search committee.        
	The court and other elected bodies could not begin operations because of technical reasons, though the Bengal Engineering and Science University Shibpur Act was formulated in 2004, said registrar Biman Bandyopadhyay.        
	With the first meeting of the court, other elected policy-making bodies of Besu like the executive council and faculty councils also became operational from Wednesday.        
	The universitys board of management  a body of nominated members that was governing the institution since its upgrade to a deemed university from a Calcutta University affiliate in 1993, was declared inoperative from Wednesday.         
	In keeping with the provisions of the 2004 Besu act, the court and the executive council should have become operational within a year of the act being formulated and the board should have been dissolved.         
	But no initiative was allegedly taken by the university to conduct elections to the administrative bodies. A source claimed the polls were deliberately deferred because Besu students and teachers unions are dominated by anti-Left groups and the authorities feared pro-Left candidates would be routed.         
	But an official said the university authorities were pursuing the Centres proposal to upgrade Besu to an Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology (IIEST) since 2006, which is why they were unable to organise elections.

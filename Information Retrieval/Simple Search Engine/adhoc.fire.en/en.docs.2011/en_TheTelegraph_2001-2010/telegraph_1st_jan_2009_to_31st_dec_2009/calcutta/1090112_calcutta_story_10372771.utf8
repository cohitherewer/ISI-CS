The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fresh take on icon reviews
                                                                                                               Fresh take on icon reviews
  - Debate over comments          A STAFF REPORTER                          Soumik Nandy Majumdar at CIMA Gallery. (Aranya Sen)                                        
	At ReView, the exhibition now on at CIMA, artists look at iconic works of art from India and the West and present their response to these. The art historian and lecturer at Kala Bhavan, Santiniketan, Soumik Nandy Majumdar, on Saturday guided a group of viewers and participating artists around the gallery to present his interpretations of these works, and invited comments from those present. His comments triggered minor debates.        
	Nandy Majumdars use of the word appropriation was one example. He had used it while commenting on Jogen Chowdhurys review of Guernica. Was the bull in Chowdhurys work a direct quote from the modern masters work or was it his own reworking? While pointing out Chowdhurys series of visages with violent expressions displayed in a half light, Nandy Majumdar said this was the first time the artist had done this, and the entire series could be seen as an installation.        
	Partha Patim Debs enigmatic painting that redefines Bhupen Khakhars Man with a Bouquet of Plastic Flowers is one of the more compelling pieces at the exhibition. Deb said his focus was on plastic flowers as plastic objects have become so much a part of our lives. For him the plastic flowers were a symbol of youthfulness and had nothing to do with homosexuality.        
	Nandy Majumdar admitted his failure to read Mayank Kumar Shyams grey painting of farmers, which was a take on M.F. Husains Zameen. Artist Sumitro Basak said all the artists in this section had tried to redefine not Husains work but their understanding of the word zameen and the modern myths that have grown around it. Nandy Majumdar said Husains work started from rural India but was in a sophisticated modernist style that was very urban. So the journey was from rural to urban and back to rural.        
	The art historian felt Swarna Chitrakars Bharatmata was a complex work, especially where she shows the three major Indian religions coexisting harmoniously. Rashmi Bagchi Sarkars Bharatmata was a more romantic image, as was Abanindranaths original. Basak said his Bharatmata began with his many identities of an artist as well as a man with bucolic links. He referred to the dislocation of the horses for rural deities that are displayed in modern settings. Nandy Majumdar pointed out the element of quiet humour in Basaks work.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Helpline for auto, not bus   8-yr window for 2-stroke
                                                                                                               Helpline for auto, not bus 
  8-yr window for 2-stroke          OUR BUREAU                    Subhas Chakraborty                                
	Behind closed doors at Writers Buildings, the government made a move on Wednesday to convert and keep some old 2-stroke autos on the road.        
	A fixed match of sorts was played out in the rotunda, with the transport minister tabling a proposal for conversion of all autos less than eight year old to LPG. The auto unions latched on to this partial win and said they would move court for such a breather.        
	After the meeting, transport minister Subhas Chakraborty played with a dead bat in public, claiming that he would only follow the high court deadline of July 31.        
	Chakraborty also said that the auto unions had pleaded with the government to postpone the promised crackdown on polluting vehicles from July 25. He made it clear that the crackdown would not happen till July 31 at least.        
	Police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti later confirmed that no action would be taken against errant vehicles till the court deadline ran out, following Wednesdays conversion push for autos less than eight years old.        
	This proposed exit option for some three-wheelers comes with 15 days to go for the high court deadline for the phase-out of all autos that are not powered by four-stroke single-mode LPG.        
	This is more a strategy to stall for time and postpone the crackdown on banned and polluting vehicles. No more than 10 per cent of the autos in Calcutta  in a fleet of 80,000-plus registered and unregistered ones  are less than eight years old, but the conversion plan will create more confusion and allow the government to postpone protests from the auto lobby, said a green activist.        
	Metro had last week blown the lid off the governments hush-hush plot to duck the deadline by converting all 2-stroke autos to single-mode LPG. Following the report, the environment and transport departments went back to the drawing board and decided to modify the plan.        
	Metro had on July 11 reported how the government was poised to fall back on a 1998 Supreme Court ruling and surreptitiously push for conversion of 2-stroke autos less than eight years old to LPG.        
	That is what happened on Wednesday at Writers between 12.30pm and 2pm, at a meeting chaired by the transport minister and attended by senior officials from the transport and environment departments, top cops and auto union leaders.        
	So many autos cannot be converted in 15 days, claimed rival union leaders united in the fight against phase-out.        
	We will push for the conversion of all 2-stroke autos manufactured after August 2000 to LPG, said Kishore Ghosh of Citu and Pramathesh Sen of Intuc. Pradip Saha of the Trinamul-backed auto union said they would also fight to try and keep all existing 2-stroke autos on the road via the conversion route.        
	What the government  and the unions  did not bother to explain was why nothing had been done to speed up conversion for a year or why thousands of unauthorised autos still rule the road.

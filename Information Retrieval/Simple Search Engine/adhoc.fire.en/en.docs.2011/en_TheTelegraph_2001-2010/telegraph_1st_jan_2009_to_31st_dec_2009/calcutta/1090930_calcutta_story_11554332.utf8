	The body of Mansa Kotal, a 52-year-old resident of I Road in Howrah, was found floating in a pond near his home, on Tuesday morning.         
	Family members of Kotal, who worked in a foundry, lodged a complaint with Liluah police station against his friend Ganesh Gupta, a 46-year-old kerosene shop owner, with whom the deceased was last seen.        
	Kotals body bore no signs of external injury. His colleagues told his son that he had left the foundry with Gupta on Sunday afternoon.

                                                                                                               Six diagnosed with swine flu

	Six persons were diagnosed with swine flu in the city on Thursday, taking the number of patients in the isolation ward of Beleghata Infectious Diseases Hospital to nine.        
	State health department official said at least four of the new patients had been to Mumbai and Pune recently and possibly contracted the H1N1 virus there.         
	The state government is planning to open more isolation units and has started talks with private hospitals in this regard.        
	Rajesh Kumar Singh, a 25-year-old Jharkhand resident admitted to Infectious Diseases Hospital for the past two days, tested positive on Thursday. He had been to Pune recently. He was sent to the Beleghata hospital after he landed in Calcutta with cough, cold and fever.         
	Shweta Mukherjee, a three-year-old Narendrapur resident whose swabs were collected on Wednesday after she showed symptoms of swine flu, also tested positive.        
	Basudeb Bhowmick, 27, Jitendra Agarwal, 36, Sheikh Sahil, 11, and Joydip Dutta, all residents of Calcutta, were the others diagnosed with the disease on Thursday.         
	A four-year-old girl from Dhaka who landed in the city with her family members on Thursday afternoon, on the way to Vellore for neurological treatment, was sent to the Beleghata hospital as she was running a temperature.        
	The first isolation ward outside the Beleghata hospital is likely to open at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. We have asked the RG Kar authorities to prepare an isolation ward, said a government official. There are also plans to open a swine flu clinic at MR Bangur Hospital.         
	Chief secretary Ashok Mohan Chakrabarti said at Writers Buildings the government would find out whether private healthcare units had the infrastructure to open isolation wards.         
	Schools like Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School, Birla High School for Girls and Garden High School have asked students not to come to class if they have fever. A teacher of Patha Bhavan said some students were sent back home since they had fever.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | M amp;S debut shop falls to footfall
                                                                                                               M amp;S debut shop falls to footfall
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Amid the festive retail boom, an ominous note has been sounded by the citys first Marks amp; Spencer outlet going bust. The UK-based retail giant, which had come to Avani Heights next to Exide House three years ago, shut shop during Puja week.        
	Yes, it was unfortunate that we had to close down our debut address in Calcutta. We had little choice as the footfall was anaemic at Avani Heights, more so following the exit of all the Planet Retail brands, Mark Ashman, the CEO of Marks amp; Spencer Reliance India Pvt Ltd, now a 51:49 JV with Reliance Retail, told Metro from Delhi.        
	The other brands in the bouquet  The Body Shop, Guess, Next, Accessorise and Planet Sports  had packed up before the festive season, all citing poor footfall. M amp;S was the last to leave, apparently to make way for a usage conversion into office space.        
	The Michael Marks-Tom Spencer partnership of 1894 vintage, then franchised in India by Planet Retail, had anchored the 30,000-sq-ft, three-level retail block in the G+12 property developed by Avani Group in late 2006, marking Calcuttas first brush with a big international retail brand.        
	Its a huge opportunity lost for Calcutta to cement its tryst with big international brands, lamented Anirudh Daga, the managing director of the Avani Group.        
	Ashman, however, promised to bring in one or two large stores to Calcutta as part of a five-year, pan-India plan to create over a million sq ft of space at 50 outlets.

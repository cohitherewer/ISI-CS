The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CPM sari with a Sabya touch
                                                                                                               CPM sari with a Sabya touch

	The second edition of the CPMs whole nine yards in red and white made its first appearance at Mahajati Sadan on Tuesday evening, with a dozen women, draped in hammer-and-sickle saris, welcoming the likes of Prakash Karat and Biman Bose.        
	Doesnt it look nice? Its eye-catching and makes a statement. I love the new sari. We got it this afternoon, preened Ratna Sen, a comrade draped in the red-and-white, on Tuesday evening.        
	What Ratna does not know is the role a certain Sabyasachi Mukherjee played in inspiring Sari 2009.        
	Hear it from the man who designed it  convener of the CPMs Ward 23 Committee, Indra Madhab Dutta.        
	I wanted to do something different from 2006. I had seen the Metro story back then (April 25, 2006), where a fashion designer (Sabyasachi Mukherjee) had suggested an interesting new design and material. But I blended motifs from the previous sari and the suggested design to come up with something original, said the 58-year-old graphic designer, who has been creating pamphlets and souvenirs for the party since 1995.        
	So, whats new about Sari 2009? In all cotton, the 4.5inch border in red is adorned with numerous white 4-inch hammer-sickle-and-stars leaning to the left. The white base also sports a number of 2.5-inch versions of the symbol in red. Two large 18-inch symbols on the anchal is the USP  inspired by Sabya, of course.        
	I am surprised; pleasantly surprised, smiled Sabya. Its been three years since I made the suggestion to Metro. It feels nice that the CPM took into account my design inputs.        
	The star designer who has his hands full draping the likes of Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Rani Mukerji for the big screen added: When my design goes beyond the realms of high society and into the masses, there must be something good about it!        
	Sari 2009 was designed on a computer screen, keeping the respective proportions of the motifs in mind. A CD bearing the design at one-third the actual size was handed over to a sari manufacturer in Burrabazar who churned out the first batch of CPM saris.        
	We have, for now, ordered 100 saris. On Tuesday we received 15, which were handed out to our comrades from the Ganatantrik Mahila Samiti. They were the ones spotted at Mahajati Sadan, said Dutta, a resident of Jorasanko.        
	Is the new-look drape a serious drain on the party exchequer? Not at all. Each sari costs less than Rs 100. For 100 saris, thats less than Rs 10,000. On principle we dont spend much on paraphernalia during campaigning, said party veteran and Citu state committee secretary Debanjan Chakraborty.        
	And what has the first day, first show response been to the sari with a Sabya touch?        
	The concept is an eye-catcher. Many more such saris will soon be seen on the campaign trail, said Chakraborty.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Life back on track for cancer-hit family
                                                                                                               Life back on track for cancer-hit family
          RITH BASU                          Sandip Sharma in his new glasses and school uniform                                   
	Sandip Sharma is back in school after nine months. The 12-year-old from Liluah was forced to quit studies after his parents were diagnosed with cancer within 10 months of each other and lost their jobs.         
	Sandip, who studied in a Hindi-medium school in Liluah, now goes to an English- medium boarding school in Deoghar, Jharkhand, after a Metro report focussed on the familys plight.         
	Sandip is relieved because his parents  Ramakant, 40, and Sunita Devi, 35  are again undergoing chemotherapy after Calcuttan Manoj Kumar Jain of the Jain Group of Industries adopted the family. Jain feels that if all corporate houses adopt one needy family then the society will go a long way.        
	The Sharmas have completed a couple of chemotherapy cycles at Subodh Mitra Cancer Hospital and Research Institute. They were transferred to AMRI Hospitals, Dhakuria, on Thursday under Subhankar Dey, the head of oncology.         
	Sandip has picked up his English and is doing well in his studies, said P.E. Joseph, the principal of Madhusthali Vidyapith. The school fees, which run up to Rs 85,000 per year, has been paid, he added.        
	The Liluah lad is happy with his new life. Its good to be back in school. Everyone here is nice to me. But I miss my mom and dad and cannot help them with the chores especially now that chemotherapy has made them weak. But I speak with them over the phone every week, he told Metro from Deoghar.        
	The Kolkata Knight Riders fan has also been to the ophthalmologist after eight months and sports a new pair of glasses. Sandeep suffers from a chronic vision problem and needs regular eye check-ups.        
	Ramakants doctor Tushar Kanti Ghosh said irreparable damage was done to his carcinogenic throat earlier this year when he stopped his own treatment after his wife was diagnosed with cancer and he ran out of money.        
	His wife is doing better though. Sunita is suffering from cancer of the oesophagus, said her doctor Sharadwat Mukherjee.        
	Sunita said she would open a bank account as many readers of Metro had asked her where they could donate money for them.        
	Manoj Kumar Jain gives us some money every month along with sponsoring our treatment and Sandips education. But we dont want to be such a lot of burden on him if we can help it, she said.

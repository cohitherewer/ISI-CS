The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Powerless in prize township
                                                                                                               Powerless in prize township
  - Land hurdle trips supply to Rajarhat        SUBHRO SAHA                                                  
	What was touted as a model township is now groping in the dark. What was touted as a symbol of peaceful and successful land acquisition is beginning to look a little foolish.        
	For New Town Rajarhat, the governments 12,000-acre showpiece township, has hit a land hurdle that has rendered it powerless.        
	Take Infospace, Bengal Unitech Universals 50-acre IT park flaunting nearly five million sq ft of cutting-edge IT domain, now ready in Action Area I.        
	What does it boast in terms of power supply? Just a temporary 5MVA connectivity, diverted from Salt Lake, through a feeder line.        
	Uniworld City, the 100-acre residential format of which sits next door, has 150 apartments ready for handover, but runs on genset power.        
	At the other end, Ambuja Realtys City Centre New Town, with over 350,000 sq ft of leasable mall area, and a 147-room five-star hotel, ready for inauguration on September 19, is also powered by gensets.        
	Further inside New Town, in Action Area II-C, a clutch of joint-sector housing projects, including Hiland Woods, Akanksha and Sunrise Point, many flats among them already handed over, are also dependent on genset power. Permanent supply from the New Town Electric Supply Company Ltd has been promised but not delivered.        
	Yes, we are behind the clock in creating a proper power supply network for the entire township. Resistance by local land holders has prevented us from erecting three critical high-tension towers that would have completed the supply loop, Saurab Das, the new managing director of Hidco, told Metro on Wednesday.        
	The giant township needs 25 such high-tension towers, of which 14 are ready. We have started work on the others, barring these three, which are held up because of the unlawful agitation by a handful of people who have already been compensated, said Das.        
	Residents of Chabna mouza, where the towers are slated to come up, are up in arms. This is multi-crop land for which the compensation is not adequate and Hidco has not announced any rehabilitation scheme, said Amin Molla, a protester.        
	Mamata voiced her support for the likes of Molla on STAR Ananda on Wednesday and gave a call for Hidcos lies to be nailed. Why should people give up their fertile land so that he (Deb) can erect some electricity poles? If they have built a township without power and basic infrastructure then it is their problem.        
	The problem, unfortunately, is now that of the residents of the ghost-town. Mala Rai Chowdhury, an employee of a private school, had to shift to Nagerbazar after staying in Rajarhat for a fortnight. Only 10 out of 500 flats in our complex had electricity when we moved in last year. Even today, some residents have to sit for hours in the sentry room to charge a cellphone, she rued.        
	The Hidco MD is setting March 2010 as the deadline. We hope to resolve the land issue by November. In another four months, there should be uninterrupted high-tension supply from Jirat, he said.        
	Real estate developers struggling to sell property in New Town because of the deficiencies in core infrastructure, are furious. This is sheer bad planning, said Nandu Belani of Bengal United Credit Belani Housing Ltd, which built Hiland Woods and is doing Hiland Willows.        
	Core infrastructure like roads and power in any integrated township should always be an upfront investment, added urban designer Partha Ranjan Das.        
	Victims like Swapan Roy, who have invested their lifes savings in a Rajarhat home, can only wait in hope for the township to become liveable.        
	First, it was Hidcos inefficiency. Now, it is the politics over land and power, rued the 50-year-old engineer who has shifted out of New Town and into a rented accommodation.                    (WITH INPUTS FROM MEGHDEEP BHATTACHARYYA AND ZEESHAN JAWED)

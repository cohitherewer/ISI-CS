	Two youths and a teenager, all apparently drunk and enjoying a joyride on a motorcycle, without wearing helmets, died after the two-wheeler crashed into a stationary trailer in Kolaghat early on Thursday.        
	Police said Arijit Bhattacharya, 20, Nemai Mondal, 28, and Surajit Adhikari, 16, were taken to Tamluk District Hospital where they were declared dead on arrival.        
	The trio, residents of Dum Dum, were on their way back to the city when the fatal accident occurred.        
	The two-wheeler belonged to Arijit, a commerce student of Raja Manindra College. The other two, who were riding pillion, were electricians.        
	Mali Mani, who runs an eatery close to the mishap spot, said the speeding bike veered off National Highway 2 and headed for the unfinished bridge on the Rupnarayan around 4.30am.        
	A trailer that had broken down on a nearby bridge a few days ago had been towed to the approach of the new bridge. The bike rammed into the goods carrier and was flung 10 feet into the air before it came crashing down, said Mani.        
	Barun Santra, the superintendent of the hospital, said the trio suffered multiple fractures and head injuries.        
	The three seem to have been drunk. We will get to know for sure after the post-mortem. No one was wearing a helmet, said an officer of East Midnapore police.        
	Arijit, his cousin Saikat Dey said, had left home around 8.30am on Wednesday telling his parents that he would go on a joyride with his friends. Family sources said Surajit, too, had left home around the same time while Nemai left around 11am.        
	Nemai leaves behind his wife and two infant daughters.

                                                                            Tuesday , November 17 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            The man who cant stop scribbling
  - Author of 300-plus stories bonds with fans from five to 50          SAMHITA CHAKRABORTY LAHIRI                          Ruskin Bond surrounded by young fans at a reading-and-interactive session on Monday evening. Picture by Pabitra Das                                        
	Suparna Majumdar and her teenaged son Aniruddha have a common bond  Ruskin Bond. And on Monday evening, they got a chance to be with the man whose books they love.        
	I have grown up reading Ruskin Bond and still enjoy his stories. Now my son is reading him, smiled the doctor as her son stood in a queue that wound its way through Starmark, at South City Mall, for the autograph of their favourite author.        
	I wanted to ask him what he loves to write most, but I didnt get a chance, rued Suparna.        
	I really enjoy writing poetry, Bond had said when Metro had asked him that a little before he arrived at the Starmark store packed with over 250 fans, aged five to 50.        
	But its difficult to convince publishers as poetry doesnt really sell, Bond said, eyes twinkling. So, I have been cunning, I slip in my poetry in between my stories!        
	But Ruskin Bond sells, and how  he is one of the few Indian authors to have all his books in print simultaneously. And that means 300 short stories, essays and novellas and more than 30 books for children. Penguin recently came out with a vintage collection of his short essays, Notes from a Small Room. He is writing more stories, said the 75-year-old with a smile.        
	How do you have the power to write so many books? asked a little boy.        
	I love to write, you give me a pen and pad and once I start scribbling, I cant stop, said Bond, adjusting his glasses as he tried to locate the questioner amid a sea of children sitting cross-legged on the floor around him in a semi-circle. They listened with rapt attention as Bond read out a delightful poem about his disastrous capers with a motorcar. I read out poetry as they are short and people wont fall asleep, Bond had said earlier in the day.        
	Another little reader wanted to know just how eccentric his Uncle Ken was. Oh, he was clumsy and incompetent and thats why I wrote about him. I am going to write another story on him, replied Bond. Children, he said, love to read about adults who are good-for-nothing as kids are always being scolded by elders for not doing things right.        
	A young woman sought advice for aspiring writers. The younger you start writing the better you will write, the younger you start reading the better you will write, said the veteran.        
	And if you are anything like Bond, Ruskin Bond, once you start writing you will never stop.

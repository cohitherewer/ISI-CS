The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | SSKM at simmer point
                                                                                                               SSKM at simmer point
  - Protest rally in hospital as evicted students blame SFI          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	The SSKM hospital campus simmered with tension on Sunday with the threat of protests boiling over on Monday and disrupting services.        
	The SUCI-affiliated All India Democratic Students Organisation (AIDSO) took out a rally on the premises to protest Saturdays violence which saw two of its supporters being driven out of the Main Hostel and 25 MBBS students being arrested.         
	If our demands of withdrawing the case against the two students and taking action against those responsible are not met, then we will gherao the authorities and declare a strike, said Mridul Sarkar, the vice-president of the AIDSOs West Bengal state committee.        
	Kabir Hossain and Diptangshu Ganguly, the two final-year students driven out of the hostel after being accused of drunken behaviour and threatening SFI supporters, denied the charges on Sunday and blamed it on SFI backlash.        
	Both of us used to be unit members of the SFI but then left it. On April 13, after the students union election, some SFI supporters smashed the door of Diptangshus room and ransacked it, Hossain told Metro. We had an argument with the SFI supporters over that and soon after that they slapped false charges against us to evict us from the hostel.        
	According to Hossain, Diptangshu and he were returning from a gynaecology class on Saturday when they were attacked by a group of SFI supporters. We locked ourselves in and only opened the door when the medical superintendent came knocking. But he ordered us to leave the hostel at once, said Hossain.        
	The two were first taken to Bhowanipore police station and later to a guest house. They are scheduled to appear at the hostel committee meeting on Tuesday.        
	A silent procession of around 200 medical students and supporters of the AIDSO and also the Trinamul Congress took part in a procession at SSKM on Sunday evening.        
	How a rally with outsiders was organised on the premises will be discussed in Mondays emergency college council meeting, said Pradip Mitra of SSKM.        
	Authorities will also demand an explanation from the police how they gave permission for a rally with outsiders inside the hospital. Trinamul councillor Anil Mukherjee was spotted at the rally.        
	We want the support of all patients relatives in our movement, said Sushovan Ghosh, a leader of the students union in the Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research at SSKM.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Wipro tables bid for Rajarhat plot
                                                                                                               Wipro tables bid for Rajarhat plot
  - 50 acres marked for IT majors campus, price can still play the spoiler          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	The state governments desperate bid to woo Wipro received a boost on Friday with the IT major putting in a formal request for land in Rajarhat.        
	The state IT department said a Wipro team inspected the plot earmarked for it in Action Area III and then met officials of Hidco, which owns the land in New Town, and submitted a request for 50 acres at a concessional price.        
	IT minister Debesh Das was quick to tout this as a turning point. The decision of Wipro to start its second campus in Bengal is quite encouraging. I believe that this facility will augment employment opportunity to a considerable extent and boost the economic activities in the state, he said.        
	Wipro, of course, was far more circumspect. A special team visited Calcutta and the specific plot. They also met the IT minister. Things are moving but we are waiting for a detailed report from the team, said a Wipro spokesperson.                  
	The land identified for Wipro in Action Area III of New Town Rajarhat is near the Shapoorji Pallonji Mass Housing project. It is a contiguous 50-acre land parcel in possession of Hidco, near the new expressway that is going to link Rajarhat to the airport, said a Hidco official. Wipro has seen the land and liked it. They have asked for a concessional price but havent defined what they mean by that.        
	Price has always been the stumbling block, with Hidco initially not willing to lower the bar from Rs 2.16 crore per acre and IT majors Wipro and Infosys making it clear that they would only come in at a concessional price.        
	But now, the government, stung by the Vedic Village fiasco and embroiled in land acquisition controversies, is ready to blink if that means getting a Wipro or an Infosys as flagbearers for its industrialisation dreams in Rajarhat.        
	According to sources, Hidco is looking at a concessional price of around Rs 1.25 crore per acre. Wipro had earlier indicated that it was being offered land by other states at less than Rs 1 crore per acre. Price has not been talked about yet, said a Hidco official.        
	But that hasnt stopped Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees IT team from ordering the bubbly.

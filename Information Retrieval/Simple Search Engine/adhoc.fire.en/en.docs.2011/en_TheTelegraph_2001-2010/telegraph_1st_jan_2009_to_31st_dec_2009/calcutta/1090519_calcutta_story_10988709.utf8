The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Park revamp with medicinal plants
                                                                                                               Park revamp with medicinal plants
          ONTHESPOT - HAJI MOHAMMAD MOHSIN SQUARE                          Medicinal plants in a corner of Haji Mohammad Mohsin Square. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                                  
	Haji Mohammad Mohsin Square, a shabby Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) park located on Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road, is turning a lush green, thanks to an NGO which has taken up its upkeep.         
	Samadarshi, the Sealdah-based NGO which works on preserving biodiversity, aims to turn Haji Mohammad Mohsin Square into a medicinal garden and has already planted rows of saplings along the banks of the pool. But years of neglect by the civic body has already taken a huge toll on the park.        
	The garden project:         
	We have been working on the medicinal garden at Haji Mohammad Mohsin Square for the past year and a half. Our plan is to develop it as a display garden for medicinal plants, where students can also come and study. We are also working on cleaning the rest of the water body, said Samadarshi secretary Soma Gupta.         
	The group has set a one-year deadline for the project. Samadarshi pays an annual licence fee of Rs 2,000 to the CMC for allowing it to use the park.         
	The condition:         
	The entrance gives way to a pavement riddled with puddles of water. The slips are broken and the swings are missing. Garbage carts dot the place.         
	We used to play cricket here but not anymore as they have dumped bricks in one corner. The park has been lying in this state for the past six months, said Class X student Siraj Hussain, a resident of Pemantle Street.         
	The water body, a shallow pool, is equally dirty. The banks are silted with wastes like tyres, plastics and earthen pots. When we took over the maintenance work, we scooped so much litter that we needed 40 lorries to cart it out, said a Samadarshi representative.         
	Whos responsible:        
	The residents are as much to blame as the civic body. Nobody cares to keep the place clean. People throw litter into the water, said Jayanta Chakraborty, who works at 12 Haji Mohammad Mohsin Square.         
	Our children have never been to the park and we prefer going to Subodh Mullick Square instead, which is far more clean, said Savita Shah, also a resident of Haji Mohammad Mohsin Square.         
	The CMC neglects this park; they dont take any steps to improve it. Neither does the councillor nor does the CMC take up any responsibility. In which park do you see garbage carts lying around? We have approached the CMC and the councillor on several occasions but no steps have ever been taken, alleged Mansoor Ahmed Mullick, the secretary of Haji Mohammad Mohsin Sports and Cultural Centre.        
	Samadarshi members allege that the councillor is trying to throw a spanner in the works. We are facing resistance from the local goons and also the councillor, who stops our work without any rhyme or reason, said the Samadarshi representative.         
	Councillorspeak:        
	I have no knowledge of the nature of the agreement between Samadarshi and the CMC. They have not taken my permission, so naturally I will stop them from working, said Iqbal Ahmed, Congress councillor of ward 62.         
	Faiyaz Ahmad Khan, member, mayor-in-council, parks and gardens, said the civic body has not been able to do much for lack of manpower. It is impossible for the CMC to maintain the citys parks without the cooperation of local people. They must come forward. Samadarshi has taken the right initiative and the situation of this park is better than before, he said.

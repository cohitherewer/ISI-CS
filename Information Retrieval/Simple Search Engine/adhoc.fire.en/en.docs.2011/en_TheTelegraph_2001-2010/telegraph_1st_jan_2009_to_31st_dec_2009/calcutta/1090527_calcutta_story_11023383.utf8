	This is the highest death toll from a natural calamity in recent memory. Most died of head injuries suffered after being hit by uprooted trees. Some were buried under the debris of mud houses or fatally injured, hit by snapped water pipes or glass shards, said an officer.        
	Chandrakanta Nayek was one of those who died after being hit by an iron pipe, which came crashing down on him from the eighth floor of a Camac Street highrise.

	Wife Vineeta  they were married a year ago  was crying inconsolably when her husbands body was brought from the morgue on Tuesday afternoon. Why has god been so unkind to me? she kept asking.        
	The couple had planned to visit their hometown in Orissa next month.        
	The family of Tapan Kumar Das could not believe that he was no more.        
	The 46-year-old, a book-binder, died after a huge tree fell on the public bus he was travelling in at the crossing of Mahatma Gandhi Road and College Street. Das, a resident of Nilmoni Dutta Road in Burtola, was on his way to work.        
	Das was taken to Medical College and Hospital where he was declared dead on arrival.         
	His wife fainted thrice after hearing about the tragedy, said an officer of Amherst Street police station.         
	Pradip Pardhan, a tailor, was crushed under a tree in Maniktala where he had gone to meet a client.        
	He was about to cross the road when a tree fell on him. He remained buried under the branches for over half an hour, an officer said.        
	Barasat MP Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar visited Pradhans house on Tuesday afternoon and promised compensation to the family.

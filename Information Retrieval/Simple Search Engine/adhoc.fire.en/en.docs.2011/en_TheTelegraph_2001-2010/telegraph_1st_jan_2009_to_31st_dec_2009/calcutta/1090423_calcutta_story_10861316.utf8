The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tolly film to release in plexes
                                                                                                               Tolly film to release in plexes
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	INOX and Fame have decided to screen first-time director Debanik Kundus Bengali film Rangeen Godhooli from Friday, when a Tollywood ban on multiplex releases was supposed to come into effect.         
	Tollywood producers and distributors have pushed back the ban to May 1 and threatened to withdraw prints currently being screened at the multiplexes till the revenue sharing dispute is resolved.        
	Arijit Dutta of Priya Cinemas, Mahendra Soni of Shree Venkatesh Films and distributor Arun Mehra were to meet the multiplex authorities on Wednesday afternoon. Nobody from the multiplexes turned up for the meeting.        
	We will withdraw the prints from the multiplexes from May 1. If the multiplex authorities want, they can sort things out. They wont gain much by releasing a film like Rangeen Godhooli, said Dutta.        
	I am not aware of any meeting. The producers-distributors must have informed our head office in Mumbai. We have already decided on screening Rangeen Godhooli from this Friday, said Virendra Marya, the regional director (east) of INOX Leisure Ltd.        
	We dont want to get involved in the tussle. We are happy that multiplexes are releasing Rangeen Godhooli, said R.S. Kampani, the distributor of the film, starring Sabyasachi Chakraborty and Bratati Bandyapadhyay.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two youths who had robbed Rs 400 from a truck driver in the port area have been sent to jail for seven years and fined Rs 1,000 each within six months of the crime.        
	Amit Chatterjee, the magistrate of the ninth fast track court at Bichar Bhawan, on Monday sentenced Sanjay Gurung and Mohammed Shakir for snatching four Rs 100 notes from Bikram Prasad after threatening him with a chopper.        
	Conviction and sentencing in such cases usually take around two years. This case was disposed of quickly, said Jawed Shamim, the head of Calcutta polices detective department.        
	Around 4am on December 12, the duo had stopped Prasads truck in front of Marine House, in the South Port police station area. As the driver got off the vehicle, Gurung and Shakir pounced on him with a chopper and took away the money, added Shamim.        
	The two returned to the area the next morning and were picked up by the police. Gurung and Shakir confessed to their crimes during interrogation.         
	The police filed the chargesheets within a month. Eight witnesses deposed before the magistrate in the case.

                      Meaningful theatre                    Theatre is a time-tested mode of education and many schools have introduced theatre as a part of the curriculum where workshops are held with students. Indian Mime Theatre has successfully taken theatre out of the confines of the classroom and has been instrumental in building social awareness and a sense of responsibility among children and adolescents through Hriday Akash, a social development project. Here participants are encouraged to project their sense of values, creativity, social obligations and duties through theatre. Prime emphasis is laid on moulding children as responsible citizens who can propagate the importance of culture and values in education. This year marks the successful completion of a decade of Hriday Akash and to celebrate the occasion, Indian Mime Theatre hosts its 9th Shishu-Kishore Natyotsav. The three-day fest will be inaugurated this evening by Dr Karuna Sindhu Das, vice-chancellor, Rabindra Bharati University and will be followed by a cultural programme and Hriday Akashs play, Prakriti (direction: Basab Chattopadhyay). The line-up for the next two days: June 13  Sayak Summer Theatre Camps Gadhaar Gyan (drama: Debashis Majumdar, direction: Moloy Mitra), Chidrens Dream by children of Little Angels School (direction: Archana Kundu) and Howrah Natadhas Lab Kush (direction: Shib Mukhopadhyay); June 14  Sanskriti Samiti, Gangadharpur, Hooghlys Panta Buri (play: Srijib Goswami; direction: Mohanta Adak), Mukabhinaya by members of Indian Mime Theatre and finally Shishu Kishore Natya Karmashalas Paap Samachar (direction: Siddhartha Chakraborty).

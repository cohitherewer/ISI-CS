The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cops seek lights on Buddhas way home
                                                                                                               Cops seek lights on Buddhas way home
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Police want two dark spots on the chief ministers way home from Writers to be lit up, a move that will also benefit countless motorists who risk their lives while navigating the stretches at night.        
	Senior officers at Lalbazar have written to the public works department, asking for installation of two high-mast lamp posts at the crossing of Kidderpore Road and Casuarina Avenue and the point where Hospital Road East and Hospital Road West meet.        
	Sources at Lalbazar said the two ill-illuminated spots are a cause of concern for cops assigned with VVIP security as well as traffic management.        
	The Kidderpore Road-Casuarina Avenue crossing is on a high-speed corridor which is also paved with tram tracks on its flanks. In darkness, it becomes difficult for motorists to spot a tram and sudden slamming of brakes often lead to collisions, said a senior officer at Hastings police station.        
	The cops have also explained to the PWD authorities the risk of negotiating the crossing of Hospital Road East and Hospital Road West  near a triangular park, with the Victoria Memorial and the Race Course on either side.        
	The two zones must be lit up to ensure safety of motorists at night, said a PWD official. But the cost is a factor.... A high-mast light installation costs around Rs 8 lakh.        
	A high-mast post is usually 30ft high and can accommodate six to eight metal halide or sodium vapour lamps.        
	Cops also want more lights on the stretch of Gostho Pal Sarani between Eden Gardens and the Mohun Bagan ground in an attempt to make the pocket crime-free at night.        
	The stretch leads to Prinsep Ghat and the Babughat bus stand. It also falls on the route of most immersion processions on their way to the Hooghly. On any given day, you will find a few defunct bulbs on the stretch. Considering the rate of occurrence of crime in the zone, we feel the road has to be properly lit up, said an officer of Maidan police station.        
	The police have also suggested that the base of the tram tracks on Dufferin Road be concreted to create more road space.

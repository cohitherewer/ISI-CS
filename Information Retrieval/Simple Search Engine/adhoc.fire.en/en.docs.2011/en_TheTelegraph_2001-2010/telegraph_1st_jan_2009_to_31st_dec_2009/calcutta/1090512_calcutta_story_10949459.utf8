The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Campaign ends in a crescendo
                                                                                                               Campaign ends in a crescendo

	Private tutor Vikas Narayan had to send his students home at 4pm on Monday as loudspeakers blaring political messages near his Jamunalal Bajaj Street home made teaching impossible. Exactly an hour later, all the loudspeakers went silent as the bar on campaigning came into effect. It is such a relief! exclaimed Narayan.        
	The decibel devil stretched the limits of tolerance of Calcuttans as the political parties raised their pitch in the last few hours of campaigning.         
	Other than loudspeakers tied to lamp posts, speakers mounted on autorickshaws bellowed out political messages as the vehicles criss-crossed roads and lanes across Calcutta from morning to evening. Streams of processions, with participants trying to outdo each other in shouting slogans, also made the rounds.        
	Election campaigning has always been noisy. But the last few hours were unbearable; my head is spinning, said homemaker Tiyasha Banerjee, a resident of Sreenath Babu Lane in central Calcutta.         
	The torture started early. Students who had planned to stay in bed longer than usual as their vacations had started were jolted awake. I was hoping to catch up on sleep but was woken up by a group of people shouting slogans at 7.15am! I could not sleep after that, said Sabiya Jamil, who studies in Class XI in Welland Gouldsmith School.        
	Pollution control board officials said every major political party in the fray was guilty of violating noise norms during campaigning. The violation was most severe on Monday. None of the microphones was fitted with noise-limiters that help keep the volume below 65 decibels. The microphones were used even outside hospitals and educational institutions.         
	Following the noise norms was the last thing on the party workers minds. The campaign strategy is different on the last day. There are many indecisive people. Today is our last chance to draw them towards us, said Mohammed Akil, who did the rounds of ward 44 on a mini-truck singing praises of CPM candidate from Calcutta North, Mohammad Salim.         
	Many in Phears Lane were put off rather than attracted by the campaigning.        
	After inflicting so much pain on us throughout the day, how can they expect our votes? asked a senior citizen who could not catch a minutes sleep on Monday afternoon because of the campaigning.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | The singing star is back
                                                                                                               The singing star is back
                              Kanan Devi                                 
	Although she was based in Calcutta, she held sway over her fans in undivided India in the early 1940s till the early 1950s. Like the legendary French singer, Edith Piaf, she rose from the gutters to win over admirers from every strata of society. It is amazing how this siren in later life willingly transformed into a matron, the very picture of middle-class respectability.         
	Groomed by Bhismadeb Chattopadhyay, Pankaj Mullick, Rai Chand Boral and Anadi Dastidar, her soprano was admired by Rabindranath, Bade Ghulam Ali Khan and Lata Mangeshkar. Light classical, bhajans and kirtan were all part of her repertoire.         
	Long before the publicity machine became an all-powerful agency for launching an actor or a singer, Kanan Devis superhit singles in films like Jawab and Hospital sold millions of copies of 78 rpm discs.         
	She began her recording career with Megaphone Company, and save a couple of Bengali songs, her entire repertoire is stored in the archives of this company that started its operations in 1910 but began its recording venture in 1932.         
	Megaphone has made good use of its archive by recently releasing a four-CD album of Kanan Devis Hindi recordings for films and non-film as well from the early 1940s.         
	There is a good range of songs from the coquettish (Zara naino se naina) and romantic (Ai chand chhup na jana) to devotional (Prabhuji Prabhuji tum). One does not have to be an admirer of golden oldies to be aware of such hits as Toofan Mail and More angana main aye ali from Vidyapati (1938) in which both she and Chhaya Devi wore costumes that would be considered bold even today.         
	What makes this album a collectors item is the detailed listing of her recordings, including the name of the film to which a song belonged as well as identifying the lyricist and music composer. Lavishly illustrated with Kanan Devis stills, this album and its superb recordings (digitally remastered) provide a good introduction to film music in the early days of the cinema when Western musical instruments and harmonies were being masterfully adapted to accompany songs that were raga-based.         
	Wanted: a litti plaza                   A man makes litti at a roadside shop. (Picture by Bishwarup Dutta)       
	Chhat puja is a colourful form of sun worship practised mostly in Bihar around this time of the year. The three-day festival ended on Saturday.         
	We in the city become aware of it only when we see raucous groups of men and women accompanied by musicians and vehicles  anything from thelas to three-wheelers and trucks  laden with several bunches of bananas, sugarcane, fruits and vegetables of the season, wend their way towards the Hooghly or any other river that is close by.         
	Women, whose prayers have been granted, throw themselves on the road as they progress towards the river.         
	A delicacy which is made during this festival is the thekua  a crunchy cookie-like morsel made of atta and flour, dry fruits, coconut and raisins, doused in ghee and oil, and cooked in the same cooking medium.         
	Most people will not be familiar with thekua because, mercifully, it is not mass produced.         
	Another delicacy from Bihar, not highly visible but available on the streets is litti. It is a simple enough tidbit  savoury sattu inside the egg-like shell of atta and roasted on an open fire. Eaten with a fiery chutney it is hot enough to light up a few dim bulbs.         
	Why arent there more places selling thekua and litti?        
	More Puja, more blues        
	Puja was always hard work. But it is getting harder, with so much eating out, so many more para quizzes, so many more antakshari contests and so many new clothes bought at amazing discounts.         
	Puja is followed by Diwali/Kali puja and Bhai phonta. More splurging, including numerous FabIndia kurtas for the brothers and bags, accessories and cosmetics for the sisters. Gifts must come with the right tag in the right package.         
	So getting over the festive season is harder. Two women were going over their account books mentally in the Metro the other day. I dont know how to go through the rest of the month. I still have my mobile bill to pay, but I have no money left, said one.         
	I want to go out tonight because I am missing the Puja days. But I have no money left, the other rued.         
	At least no money saved some money for her.

                                                                                                               Constable held for snatching 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 30-year-old constable posted at Diamond Harbour police station was arrested on Tuesday for trying to snatch a womans necklace in Noapara, Barrackpore, while riding pillion on a motorcycle.         
	Police suspect Paritosh Biswas was the mastermind of a snatching racket active in Titagarh, Khardah and Sodepur.         
	Biswas, a resident of Titagarh, had teamed up with a local youth, Biswajit Mondol, 28, to target morning walkers. Mondol would drive the bike while Biswas would ride pillion and snatch valuables from pedestrians, said an officer.         
	On Tuesday, Biswas was on leave. The police said the duo tried to snatch a womans necklace but it got stuck in her sari.         
	This caused Mondol to lose balance and the duo fell, the officer said.         
	The woman raised an alarm and local people nabbed the two and called the police. The duo have been remanded in 14 days judicial custody.         
	North 24-Parganas police superintendent Rahul Srivastava said: We arrested Biswas on specific charges and have alerted senior officers in South 24-Parganas where he was posted.        
	Biswas told cops he had taken to snatching for extra income, said an officer.

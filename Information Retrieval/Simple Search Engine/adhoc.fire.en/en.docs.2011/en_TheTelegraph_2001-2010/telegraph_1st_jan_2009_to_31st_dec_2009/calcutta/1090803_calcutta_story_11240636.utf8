The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Clean-up drive for property brokers
                                                                                                               Clean-up drive for property brokers
          SUBHRO SAHA                              
	Over 70 property marketing agents in Calcutta have come together to address consumer grievances on a war footing and weed out rogue elements in a bid to boost buyer confidence in todays difficult market situation.        
	The need of the hour is greater transparency in deals and much improved service standards for the customer, which can only be achieved if we can set our own house in order, Tushar Kanti Das, the president of the Realtors amp; Estate Consultants Association (Reca), Calcutta, told Metro.        
	As a first step, the brokers body is offering a first-of-its-kind real estate valuation course to be conducted by US-based expert Gheorghe Badescu.        
	The course (to be conducted in the city on August 5 and 6) will benefit real estate agents, promoters/developers, architects, chartered accountants, lawyers, home finance companies and banks. The purpose is to spread awareness on the valuation process, methodologies, global standards and best practices, said Das.        
	The selling agents role is critical as their job doesnt end with just concluding a deal. They should also take care to provide accurate information to buyers, Santosh Rungta, the national president of Credai, had told Reca members recently, stressing the need for a code of conduct.        
	Nudged by the developers body, the marketing agents have moved to modify their memorandum of article into a full-fledged code of conduct. We are focusing on transparency, accountability, ethical business practices, good governance in industry and consumer satisfaction, added a Reca official.        
	The association is also setting up a grievance cell for customers. We will have our panel of lawyers to help in arbitration, and any member agent found guilty of malpractice, will be expelled from Reca and penal proceedings recommended, said Das.        
	There are over 500 estate agents in Calcutta and its fringes, while the number of organised outfits with a proper corporate structure wont even reach double figure. Currently, no official certification is required for someone to become a real estate broker.

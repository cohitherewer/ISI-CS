The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pass-the-buck on water
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Pass-the-buck on water
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The civic body and the public health engineering (PHE) department are locked in a pass-the-buck game while a large number of people in the city are being forced to drink contaminated water.        
	The high court had in March asked the PHE department to ensure supply of pure water after being told by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) that the water supplied to 29 hospitals, three railway stations, Writers Buildings, Lalbazar and the civic headquarters were found to have been contaminated.        
	The order followed a submission by the civic body that water was being contaminated in the reservoirs of the respective buildings, which was the duty of the PHE department to inspect.        
	But the PHE department in an affidavit submitted to the court last week passed the buck to the CMC.        
	Instead of mentioning the steps it has taken to ensure that water does not get contaminated, as ordered by the high court, the PHE department has made a list of things which it feels the CMC needs to do.        
	The PHE department wants the CMC to         
	 Identify the spots where the water is being leaked and getting contaminated        
	 Test the quality of water at all relevant points         
	 Conduct surveys to nail the causes of contamination        
	 Check residual chlorine accumulation in all dead-end tap points         
	 Chlorinate if the residual chlorine is below 0.2mg per 1ml of water.        
	The PHE department has claimed in the affidavit that it supplies potable water only to a few hospitals and offices in the city, ignoring the fact that it is responsible for conducting regular tests of the potable water and convey the findings to the civic body, said environment activist Subhash Dutta, who filed the case on water contamination in the high court in 2002.        
	The March report of the CMC had stated that NRS, Chittaranjan Cancer and National Medical College were among the hospitals where the water was contaminated.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | welcome to city of fear 
                                                                                                               Welcome to city of fear     Trauma for child mind
          POULOMI BANERJEE                                    
	Calcutta, living from violence to violence, is hurtling towards the brink of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.        
	Arpa Dutta, a homemaker, was near Jadubabur Bazar on Thursday when she heard that buses were being set on fire by Congress vandals. She was frantic to reach St James School, where her son is a student in Class VI.        
	In her mind flashed another day about a year and a half back when Park Circus erupted in fire over Taslima Nasreen. I had gone to Sealdah for some work and I could get nothing to take me to the school. The traffic was immobile. I started to run, worried that I might not reach on time and that would scare him, remembers Arpa.         
	When she finally reached St James, she was surrounded by her sons friends, all of them as distressed as her son. The children were all scared. How will my mother come? they kept asking.        
	As the city becomes a playground of political clashes, and as reports of vendetta and violence pour in every day from other parts of Bengal, psychiatrists feel that like other disturbed areas, Calcutta too must get used to living with trauma.        
	Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder can happen if a person is exposed to one or more situations of violence or aggression. It is not a common disorder, as such incidences are rare, but if Calcutta is exposed to such situations repeatedly, it may soon be manifest, says Ishita Sanyal, a psychologist.        
	The disorder is usually triggered by a disaster, such as the tsunami or an earthquake. But constant spurts of violence, even if not very severe, or constant anticipation of violence can do the damage.        
	It results in the individual feeling extreme fear and helplessness, says another city psychiatrist. While it can affect anyone, of any age, consultant psychologist Anuttama Banerjee feels that children are most vulnerable to violence-induced trauma.         
	Violence triggers a survival anxiety, especially in kids. Yesterday police were hardly active in controlling the situation. That has a very bad impact on the young mind, she says.        
	A student of Class VII of La Martiniere for Girls says she felt frightened by Thursdays events. Some of us were staying back after school gave over for extra-curricular work and a senior came and told us it had all been cancelled. We heard buses were being burnt in front of Belle Vue Clinic and La Martiniere for Boys and we were very scared, she says.        
	My first thought was how I would reach home. We were helped to make calls home and told to wait in the library for our cars, she recalls.        
	On her way back from St James with her son, Arpa saw buses being burnt near Minto Park. She tried to shield her son from the sight, but he sensed the agitation in the air. He kept pulling at me to go faster. The Park Circus incident also left an impact on his mind. If I ever tell him even as a joke that I wont pick him up from school, he is very agitated. He keeps asking me whether I will, whether I remember when his school gives over, says the worried mum.        
	The child may be scared to return to school, says Sanyal.        
	There is no way of preventing fear, except making children feel more secure. One has to keep telling them that they shouldnt give in to fear, says Banerjee.        
	In more extreme cases the disorder can lead to sleep problems, nightmares, recurrent thoughts about the incident, anger, emotional outbursts or reluctance to go out.        
	The scar of street violence on the young mind is hard to heal, warn psychiatrists. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee or Mamata Banerjee or Subrata Mukherjee, of course, could not be bothered.

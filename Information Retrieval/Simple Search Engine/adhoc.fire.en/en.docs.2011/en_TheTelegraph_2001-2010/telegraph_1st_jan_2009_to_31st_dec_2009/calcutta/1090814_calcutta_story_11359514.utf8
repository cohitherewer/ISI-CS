                                                                                                               Police vigil on zoo
          A STAFF REPORTER                           A Marmoset at the zoo                                   
	Calcutta police will deploy officers inside the zoo for better surveillance. According to a preliminary plan, 12-15 officers will be posted at different points on the sprawling campus.         
	Policemen would patrol the compound. If necessary, they would co-ordinate with the zoo administration on security issues, including monitoring crowd movement. There will also be police patrol outside, said a senior officer of Calcutta police.        
	The services of the private agency responsible for zoo security was terminated after the theft. It has not been decided whether the police vigil would be in place after a new security agency takes charge at the zoo.        
	Chief secretary Ashok Mohan Chakrabarti admitted that the zoo was shabbily maintained and said he would visit it soon. It appears the monkeys have been stolen. There is no denying that there was gross negligence, he said.         
	Cops from the detective department met their officers of Watgunge police station on Thursday and sought a list of burglars who steal by cutting through fencing.

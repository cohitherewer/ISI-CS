The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | International hits rule party charts
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      International hits rule party charts
          POULOMI BANERJEE                                        I Got A Feeling by The Black Eyed Peas is a rage on the dance floor this party season        
	Chor bazaari, Dhan te nan and Chiggy wiggy may have set the beat to festive fun a couple of months back but international hits are the ones pepping up the year-end parties.         
	Puja and Diwali is more about Bollywood music. But I Got A Feeling is the current rage on the dance floor, says DJ Kunal of Venom. Other DJs too have been reaching for The Black Eyed Peas track mixed by David Guetta.        
	According to DJ Girish of Shisha, the tracks success in the city mirrors the international trend. Hip hop tracks co-produced by House artistes have been popular this year. The lyrics by Black Eyed Peas are very hip hop but Guettas music has given it a House feel, he says.        
	Other international tracks ruling the dance floor this season are Day and night, Your kisses of dynamite, Hotel California 2009, Space, Morning after dark, I love the way and Shakiras She wolf.        
	DJ Harish of Dublin feels European music is ruling the charts this year, taking over from last years rage, Caribbean House.        
	And Calcutta is in sync with the trends. Except for the Puja period when we play a lot of Bollywood, the rest of the year we aim to strike a balance. For the Christmas parties, we also push a lot of Christmas tracks like Last Christmas and Boney Ms Marys Boy Child, explains Harish.        
	Though songs are released internationally every week, many DJs hold on to new releases for the parties in December. Sometimes if there are several international releases in November and we dont have time to play them on weekends, we play them in the year-end party season, says Kunal.        
	Harish adds that international releases during the festival month are played later.         
	The DJs offer various reasons for the popularity of international tracks in winter  from more people wearing western clothes to more guests from abroad. But theres no forgetting Bollywood, whatever the time of the year.        
	The music we play largely depends on the crowd on the dance floor. New Years eve parties see a very commercial crowd, many of whom do not party the rest of the year. So there is demand for Bollywood at such parties since that is what many are more exposed to, says Harish.        
	Agrees Kunal: We play 40 per cent Bollywood and 60 per cent international at New Years eve parties.

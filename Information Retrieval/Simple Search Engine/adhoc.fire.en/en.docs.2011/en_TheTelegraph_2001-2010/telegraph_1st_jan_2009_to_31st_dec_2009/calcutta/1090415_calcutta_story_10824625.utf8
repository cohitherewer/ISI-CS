	Development without monitoring, illegal constructions, corrupt builders and irresponsible traders are responsible the 50 fires in the Burrabazar area in the past two years.         
	According to the Chamber of Textile Trade and Industry, there are almost 2,500 katras in Burrabazar (buildings mostly occupied by commercial establishments with families staying on the upper floors) and 150 in Posta. Less than one per cent of these buildings are equipped to handle a small fire, said fire department officials.        
	Metro visited three buildings in the commercial hubs to check their firefighting preparedness.         
	P-11 New Howrah Bridge Approach Road        
	Narrow passages, dark staircases, small shops and godowns filled to the brim with garments and plastic products and naked wires hanging from the ceiling greet visitors at the nine-storeyed building.        
	A short-circuit sparked a blaze in the building, which houses more than 200 units but lacks even the most basic fire safety measures, on Monday.         
	We did not find a single fire extinguisher in the building, said a senior official West Bengal Fire and Emergency Services.        
	A water reservoir is also absent and one of the two entry-exit points remains closed. The meter box, where the fire started, was in need of repairs.         
	The over 2,000 people in the building on Monday afternoon had a close shave. We could escape because the fire did not spread. There was a distinct possibility of a repeat of the 100-hour Nandaram blaze, said Chetan Somani, a hosiery trader in the building.         
	The meter box was in a terrible condition. It did not even have a door. Naked wires were hanging everywhere. The fire was waiting to happen, said Pankaj Kumar Kedia, a charted accountant who has an office on the second floor of the building.               
	19 Synagogue Street 
  (City Centre)        
	Opposite P-11 New Howrah Bridge Approach Road stands five-storeyed City Centre, which houses 400 offices. From the outside, the building, which came up in 1992, seems to be in better condition than most structures in the area, but the inside presents a different picture.        
	On the terrace of the building, a full-fledged kitchen operates round-the-clock. It belongs to Bhikaram Chandmal, which has an outlet on the ground floor of the same building.         
	Metro found 10 men busy frying singharas and kachoris on three huge electric ovens in the kitchen, not larger than 50sq ft. The heat from the ovens had made the room a cauldron. Electrical cables criss-crossed the walls.        
	We switch to LPG when the demand increases. On an average, we produce 5,000 singharas and kachoris in the workshop, said one of the cooks.         
	Office-owners in City Centre claimed repeated complaints to the fire department, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, police and the pollution control board against the kitchen have been futile.        
	The building can go up in flames anytime, said Madan Joshi, who has an office on the fifth floor.        
	The rules are being violated under the nose of the authorities. The kitchen operates 18 hours a day. It is like a time bomb waiting to explode. There can be a short circuit anytime. There are no firefighting measures in the kitchen, said Anil Kumar Mangat, another office-owner.        
	The owner the store, Ram Pratap Agarwal, was not available for comment. A manager said the shop had the necessary licences. None of the documents he produced mentioned the kitchen on the terrace.               
	4 Synagogue Street        
	The 10-storeyed building at the back of City Centre has about 250 commercial units, dealing in oil, garments, turmeric, plastic toys, cardboard boxes and umbrellas. Water reservoirs and fire extinguishers are absent. Naked cables were hanging everywhere and the meter box was broken. The traders could not recall the last time the wiring was overhauled.        
	Ten families reside in the building. Most of the commercial units deal in inflammable products, hence there can be a fire any moment. We live in fear of being burnt alive, said Priya Santhelia, one of the residents.                
	Official version: Whenever a fire breaks out anywhere we lodge complaints but no action is ever taken. We are still trying to bring the offenders to book, said Gopal Bhattacharjee, the director-general of West Bengal Fire amp; Emergency Services on Monday.

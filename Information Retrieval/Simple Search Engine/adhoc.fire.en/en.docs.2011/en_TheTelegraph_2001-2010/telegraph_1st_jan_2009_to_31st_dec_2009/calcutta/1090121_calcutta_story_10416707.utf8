The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rs 1.27cr booty recovered, 5 held 
                                                                                                               Rs 1.27cr booty recovered, 5 held 
          A STAFF REPORTER                                       
	Rob-and-recover in Calcutta crossed the crore mark on Tuesday with Rs 1.27 crore being displayed in the conference room of Lalbazar.        
	The loot on the large U-shaped table was from the robbery in a biotech company of Fairlie Place on the night of January 13.        
	The initial complaint from Pangene Biotech Pvt Ltds was that Rs 30 lakh had been looted, but then the amount was raised to around Rs 1.3 crore, making it the largest recorded swoop in the citys recent crime history.        
	Between Monday afternoon and Tuesday morning, sleuths from the detective department rounded up five accused and recovered Rs 1.27 crore in cash.        
	 A motley group  a staff member of Pangene Biotech, his former colleague, a drummer at a bar along with his bouncer friend, and a rice-mill labourer from Burdwan  was arrested for plotting the Fairlie Place rob-and-run.        
	Almost the entire amount has been recovered and the main accused have all been arrested, police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti said on Tuesday.        
	The probe revealed that Anupam Dutta, a member of the company staff, and former colleague Sanjib Panja were the masterminds.        
	Their alleged motive? The low salary they were paid in a cash-rich company.        
	The sacking of Panja, who drew a salary of Rs 2,300, at the beginning of the month acted as the catalyst for him and Dutta to plot revenge. The two knew exactly how cash was counted and handled in the company, sleuths said.        
	The first meeting took place in the mess on Sanatan Sil Lane of Muchipara where Panja lived. Dutta then called in cousin Rajesh Pramanik, a drummer in a city bar. Rajesh, who lived in a rented house on Neelgunge Road in Belghoria, got Swapan Chakrabarty, a bouncer at the same bar.        
	Since most of them hailed from Kalna, they managed to get Mujibur Rehman Molla, a rice-mill labourer, into the gang, said Jawed Shamim, the city detective chief.         
	At 10pm on January 13, three members of the gang walked into the mezzanine floor office where Shyam Sundar Lahoti was counting cash with peon Samir Manna. They were blindfolded, gagged and tied up. Bundles of Rs 1,000, 500 and 100 notes were looted.        
	Mobile phone call records helped police establish the link between Dutta and Panja.        
	On Monday, sleuths told the company to send Dutta to the Mercantile Building opposite Lalbazar for some work. He was arrested there and made to call up his accomplices for the police to round them up.        
	The cash was recovered from a bag in Rajeshs rented house in Belghoria.

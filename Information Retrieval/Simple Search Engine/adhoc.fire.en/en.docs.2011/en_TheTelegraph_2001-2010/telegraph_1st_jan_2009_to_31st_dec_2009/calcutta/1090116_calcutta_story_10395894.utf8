                                                                                                               Fog takes a toll on   travel
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Fog fatigue grounded air travellers with visibility at Calcutta airport dropping for the second consecutive day, leading to cancellations, delays and diversions.        
	Flight operations remained suspended from Wednesday night till around 9.30am on Thursday and 40 flights were delayed, airport officials said. At one point, visibility had dropped to zero. Six flights were diverted and three were cancelled.        
	The airport Met office said this was the second time this winter that visibility had plunged to zero. More fog has been forecast on Friday.         
	The factors that trigger fog formation are still there, said B.K. Mondal, the director of the airport Met office.         
	Visibility started dropping around 9.50pm on Wednesday night and touched zero at 5.50am. No flight could land through the night.        
	Lufthansa Airliness Calcutta-bound flight from Frankfurt with 221 passengers on board was diverted to Hyderabad. It finally arrived in the city at 9.10am and took off on its return journey at 10.30am, almost eight hours behind schedule.        
	An Air India Express flight from Singapore and a Kingfisher flight from Chennai were also diverted to Hyderabad. An Air India flight from Jeddah was diverted to Nagpur and IndiGos flight from Mumbai and JetLites from Bangalore returned to those cities. All these flights arrived in the city later.                                                  
	All these flights, however, arrived in the city later in the day.         
	The Air India Express service to Bangkok and JetLites flights to Guwahati and Dibrugarh were cancelled for the day. Six flights that were to land hovered above the airport for around 40 minutes each because of low visibility.         
	Long-distance and suburban train services took a fog hit, too, affecting everyone from the hawker to the student. A group of 200-odd students of various schools put up a rail blockade at the Howrah yard, near Tikiapara station, from 11.40am till 12.50pm to protest delays in the South Eastern Railway section.         
	Mukesh Prasad, a Class IX student, said: My physics and chemistry exams began at 11.15am but the train I was to take didnt reach Howrah station by then.        
	The Howrah-bound Coromondal Express and Gitanjali Express arrived late because of the blockade.         
	The Jnaneswari Express, Puri Express, Mumbai Mail, Yeswantpur Express and other trains were delayed by one to two hours on an average. Trains leaving Howrah started later than scheduled.         
	Fourteen passengers of a Calcutta-bound bus from Burdwan were injured when it rammed into a truck near Somsara on the Durgapur Expressway, which was then covered in dense fog. The injured passengers were taken to Chinsura Imambara Hospital.

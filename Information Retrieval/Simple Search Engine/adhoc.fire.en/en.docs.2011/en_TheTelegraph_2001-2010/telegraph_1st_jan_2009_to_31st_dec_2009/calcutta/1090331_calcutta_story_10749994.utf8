The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Killer father nailed
                                                                                                               Killer father nailed
          A STAFF REPORTER                                             
	The father of a budding table tennis player who died after being hit by him with a bat for missing a shot during practice has been convicted of physical assault leading to death.        
	Deepak Bhattacharya, 45, stood stonefaced as judge Pradip Barman of the fifth fast track court in Alipore pronounced the verdict on Monday, a little over two years after 14-year-old Biswadeep died of internal injuries.        
	The victims mother, Papia, and 12-year-old sister Neha, the lone witness in the case, were just outside the door to the packed courtroom when the conviction was announced.        
	I had expected this. The main thing is the punishment, which I would like to be maximum, Papia told Metro minutes later.         
	The judge is scheduled to pass the sentence on Tuesday. Public prosecutor Utpal Ghose said the sentence would be based on the provisions of Section 304 Part II, pertaining to culpable homicide not amounting to murder. The maximum prison term under this section is 10 years.        
	Neha, who had testified against her father in June last year, said she wanted him to suffer just like my brother did.        
	The Class VIII student said her father, a supplier of electronic goods, had always been hot-headed and authoritarian.        
	He would browbeat my mother, me and Dada (Biswadeep) into submission every time we opposed him. He had called me from prison (Alipore Central jail) to warn me against doing what the public prosecutor said, Neha recalled, looking up to her mother for support.        
	Papia confirmed the threats. My husband is a man without remorse, she said.        
	Neha, then barely 10, had seen her father first hurl a shoe and then the bat at Biswadeep. The talented table tennis player  he was part of the medal-winning Bengal team in the Cadet sub-junior national championship in Chennai in 2004  collapsed in pain and died before reaching hospital.         
	It was around 9am on January 8, 2007, when Dada and I entered the playroom on the third floor of our house to practise. Around 10am, our father arrived and warned Dada not to miss a shot. When my brother did miss one, father hurled a shoe that flew past him. After a second miss, father threw a shadow-practice bat that hit Dada in his lower abdomen, recalled Neha.        
	Biswadeeps coach Tapan Chandra, one of those present in court on Monday, said that was not the first instance of Deepak assaulting his son.         
	Biswadeep would complain to me about his father. One day he fainted while practising with me. When I asked him, he said his father had beaten him up and that he was feeling weak. I immediately contacted Deepak to say that I wouldnt train a boy who was being regularly tortured at home, Chandra said.        
	Several of the Bhattacharya familys neighbours in Regent Park attended the hearing. Most seemed to know about Deepaks temper and his habit of beating up his children without provocation. The mother and daughter are better off with him in jail. The court should ensure he stays there, said a woman in her 30s.        
	As soon as the judge left the room, defence lawyer Arup Ghosh went up to his client and the duo discussed something before Deepak was escorted out. Ghosh declined comment on the conviction.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Act from your heart
                                                                                                               Act from your heart
										      Sunderlal Bahuguna, the man behind the Chipko movement, was in town. Jayanta Basu spoke to the 82-year-old activist who was recently awarded the Padmabhusan:                         Sunderlal Bahuguna				                           
	You have been awarded the Padmabhusan this year. How does it feel to receive an award from the government against which you have fought the better part of your life, to save the Himalayas or protest against the Tehri dam?               
	It is a strange feeling. It is not that I have always been at loggerheads with the government  after all former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had agreed to discontinue the cutting of trees in the Himalayas beyond a certain height.         
	But I had earlier refused to accept the Padmashree. This time I accepted the award with the hope that it would give some weightage to my proposal on a detailed Himalaya policy for which I have been rooting for long.         
	Without such a policy, the Himalayas will perish in no time, especially with this persistent change in climate as well as global warming.                 
	Do you consider climate change to be an imminent danger or hype? It is being said that the ice in the Himalayas will melt in another 30 years         
	I definitely consider it a real danger to the Himalayas. I do not know the timeline but its a fact that the glaciers are receding in the mountains, faster than it happened earlier.         
	The rivers are affected. I have lived by the Ganga for six decades and feel that its volume has reduced to half during the period.         
	Today people are talking about climate change and the need to protect the trees, but when you started the Chipko movement, nobody used to talk about the environment, forget climate change. What led you to start the movement?         
	First of all let me humbly correct you, not I but the village women of Uttarakhand started the Chipko movement when they initiated embracing the trees, part of their lives and definitely livelihoods, to save them from being cut by government-appointed contractors trying to procure the wood to make cricket bats!         
	I joined the movement later. Subsequently the movement spread to Karnataka, among other places. We had not considered the cutting of trees as an environmental offence; to those village women, environment was a way of life.               
	It is wonderful how you and your associates could motivate largely uneducated village women to fight for the environment three and half decades back, while today experts are finding it hard to motivate urban educated people...         
	The problem with todays experts is that they think with the brain and then try to act with the hand, while we were used to taking the issues from the brain to the heart to the hand! Unless you can convince people that their very existence is linked with the activism, and they believe the words with their heart, nothing can be achieved.         
	I would also like to mention that villagers may lack formal education, but they remain much closer to nature and understand what is good or bad for them.         
	You have repeatedly stressed on the Himalaya policy, what do you actually mean by that?         
	I feel the entire Himalayas should be converted into a natural dam with very aggressive aforestation that will allow the water course to run in its original paths before they are made to take a course through the formation of large dam like the Tehri project.         
	In the long run these dams will cease to be effective with continuous lessening of water as a result of climate change. The Himalaya policy will not only bring back water to the rivers like the Ganga, but will also be able to arrest climate change to a large extent.         
	Unless you can save the Himalayas and the Ganga, you cannot save this country. I have spoken to the Prime Minister; I will be also meeting the chief ministers of the states with the Himalayas in them. Lets hope something concrete will happen.               
	How do you describe the role of the countrys politicians regarding environment?         
	Politicians only think about the next five years while social activists think about the next five generations!        
	But you were a politician in your early life        
	I joined politics at the age of 12 and held the post of general secretary in Uttar Pradesh Congress after Indepence. But my wife Vimla, who was a follower of Sarla Behn, Gandhijis disciple and a pioneer of womens empowerment in India, had put a condition before marriage that I would have to leave politics and work for social development in the remote villages.         
	I left politics and joined the social movement  it was the turning point of my life!

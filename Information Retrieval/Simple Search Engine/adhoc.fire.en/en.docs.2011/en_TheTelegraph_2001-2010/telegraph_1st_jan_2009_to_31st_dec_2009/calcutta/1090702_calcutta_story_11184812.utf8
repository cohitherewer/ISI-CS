The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bill tabled for doctor safety
                                                                                                               Bill tabled for doctor safety
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The chief minister promised doctors a law to protect them from physical violence by relatives of patients on Doctors Day.         
	If the fear of an attack is always at the back of the doctors minds, how can they treat patients calmly and to the best of their ability and knowledge? The government sympathises with you (doctors) and realises how unnerving it can be, said Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at a programme organised by the Indian Medical Association (IMA) at Sisir Mancha to mark the birth and death anniversary of Bidhan Chandra Roy.         
	You can consider the bill as good as passed. We are just finalising the rules, the chief minister added to a round of applause.        
	Other states have already passed similar bills.         
	The West Bengal Medical Services Persons and Medicare Service Institutions (Prevention of Violence and Damage to Property) Bill, 2009, was introduced in the Assembly on Tuesday.         
	Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra told the gathering that he had appealed to the MLAs to support the bill cutting across party line.         
	The bill was discussed by the subject committee on Wednesday and we want to pass it before the end of the current Assembly session, said Mishra.        
	Atrocities against doctors was the theme of all the addresses by IMA functionaries at the programme.        
	The chief minister also lauded the accomplishments of doctors from the state.

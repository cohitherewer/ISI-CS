	Calcutta University is planning to fine students and bar them from sitting for exams to stop clashes on campus.        
	Student trouble on examination-related issues and union elections is increasing in colleges, affecting academic activities. The heads of colleges have been asked to take steps to stop such incidents, said a member of the universitys undergraduate council, which discussed the matter on Thursday.        
	The university authorities asked the undergraduate council secretary to meet the principals of colleges that have seen vandalism by students.        
	The secretarys reports will be placed before the universitys disciplinary committee and stern action will be taken against those found guilty, said Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee, the pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs).         
	There is a proposal to suspend guilty students, bar them from appearing for exams or slap fines on them, according to sources. The university will also counsel students to stay away from violence and boost security arrangements on campuses.        
	Furniture, windowpanes and notice board worth Rs 3 lakh were destroyed in a clash between supporters of two students bodies in Heramba Chandra College on Monday night.        
	Recently, students clashed in Sarsuna, Diamond Harbour, Kshudiram Bose Central, St Pauls, Gourmohan Sashimohan, Sammilani, Girish Chandra Basu and New Alipore colleges.

                      Lyrical confluence                    Writers have reflected time through their works, but legends have always perceived time in their own way. They have portrayed art with their unique vision and made others look at life from their own perspective. Therein lies the key to their immortality and timelessness. A name synonymous with Urdu literature, Mirza Ghalib was born in an era before that of Tagore. Ghalib expressed love like someone who has found delight in love as well as suffered its bereavement. His couplets on love have been set to various ragas to become great ghazals. A similar philosophy of love has been expressed by Tagore, whose greatest works celebrate the divinity and immortality of love. This evenings programme, You amp; I... Where Tagore Meets Ghalib, offers an amazing experience where Tagore, in search of love, peeps out through his dakshiner baranda to behold Ghalib. They meet, they share, they speak, and thus yeh na thi humari qismat will find its expression in tomar aamar biroher aei antorale or hazaron qhwahishe aisi ke har qhwahish pe dam nikle will echo the emotion of tobu monay rekho. Bringing together the two poets from two different centuries to share their thoughts on love will be Pramita Mallick (exponent of Tagore songs), Soumyojit Das (vocalist) and Sourendro Mullick (pianist). Sujoy Prosad Chatterjee will interpret the romantic philosophy of Ghalib and Tagore with anecdotes and poems. Hosted by Antiquity.                  lEvent: Music concert on the works of Mirza Ghalib and Rabindranath Tagore lWhen: Today at 6.45 pm lWhere: Satyajit Ray auditorium, ICCR, 9A Ho Chi Minh Sarani

										      stage                        A scene from Dhaka Theatres Dhaboman, the inaugural play at the 26th Nandikars National Theatre Festival 09				                           
	The 26th Nandikars National Theatre Festival 09 at the Academy of Fine Arts began with thoughts of brotherhood and keeping ones chin up in dismal times. The first play was Dhaboman by Dhaka Theatre on December 16, the day Bangladesh won its freedom from Pakistan with Indias help 38 years ago.         
	By bringing to the festival plays from troubled regions like Bangladesh, Pakistan, Manipur and Assam, Nandikar hopes to promote understanding and amity at the grassroots level.        
	Beautifully choreographed with music from various Bangladeshi traditions, Dhaboman is rich in the late Selim Al Deens characteristic evocative text. It is the tale of a young male buffalo Shorab (played by Esha Yousu) whose faith and love for his human family (the farmer Nahbat, his wife and crippled son) crashes when he realises that to them he is just a domestic animal who can be sacrificed for their sons welfare.        
	Shorab is a misfit with his knowledge of human ways and the duties of domestic cattle. Shimul Yousuffs directorial debut brought to the fore the age-old conflicts of love and betrayal between man and man, and man and nature.        
	Dont go by the brand, check out the lesser-known plays. There is more to Manipur than (Ratan) Thiyam and (Heisnam) Kanhailal, and even in (Vijay) Tendulkars plays one must not overlook the savage satire of Jaat Hi Poochho Sadhu Ki for Ghasiram Kotwal, Nandikar director Rudraprasad Sengupta advised the audience.         
	Y. Rajendra Singhs Mompak will be staged at 3pm on Sunday. His troupe Panthoibi Natya Mandir of Imphal has been exploring new forms like Manipuri folk clowning. In Mompak (Mattress) a girl disguises three suitors as a mattress to protect them from her fathers wrath.         
	Later in the evening comes Zikr-e-Nashunida (Discussing the unheeded) from Pakistan, which is a series of narratives on the wrongs of war. The Urdu play directed by Sheema Kermani and Anwar Jafri was written by Prasanna Ramaswamy, an Indian.         
	On December 21, Paradise Theatre will stage Acheekpagi Khonjel (Sound of a voice) on man-woman relationships, directed by L Kishworjit. The group BAA from Assam will present Miri Zeeyoree on December 22. Written and directed by Anup Hazarika, it presents the tragic tale of Panei and her lover Jonkia.       SEBANTI SARKAR

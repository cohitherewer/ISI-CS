The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pop protest pitch to hit traffic for a six
                                                                                                               Pop protest pitch to hit traffic for a six
										      A STAFF REPORTER      tt for city : CHAOS ROAD                              
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was the man of the match on Friday in the game called disruption on a pitch popularly referred to as the Metro channel.        
	Minimum effort-maximum effect continued to be the match-winning protest formula as the Howrah unit of the Left Front ended its 72-hour demonstration against price rise with a bang, hosting both Bhattacharjee and Biman Bose and holding the city centre to ransom for hours.        
	Why couldnt the Howrah unit hold its programme in Howrah, instead of the Metro channel? This is the best platform for any kind of protest. It is centrally located, and even a few demonstrators can grab eyeballs and force commuters to take notice, said one of the organisers.        
	On Friday there were more than a few demonstrators  70,000 according to police estimates  who took over both flanks of the Metro channel and threw traffic out of gear for six hours along Chowringhee, CR Avenue, SN Banerjee Road, Lenin Sarani, Bentinck Street and beyond.        
	We chose the Metro channel because its easy to organise important meetings here. Also, the programme involved a memorandum to be submitted to the governor and a speech by the chief minister. The Metro channel is a shout away from Raj Bhavan and very close to Writers, Tridib Bhattacharya, the CPMs Howrah district secretary, told Metro.        
	On this one matter  the importance of being seen in the Metro channel  CPM and Trinamul Congress sing the same tune.        
	Its much easier to conduct meetings and demonstrations there than at any other place in the city. It guarantees attention, said a Trinamul leader, on the one stretch of road that unites the rivals playing the chaos card.        
	This is really frustrating. This is the seventh time in three days that I have been stuck between Victoria House and New Market for close to an hour, said Manas Roy, 50, an income tax lawyer wondering how the police can give permission for such disruptive rallies on a weekday.        
	Police permission for the citys most popular protest platform is a farce  protesters inform us about the rallies, rather than seeking a clearance from us and our hands are tied because of political pulls and pressures, admit the so-called custodians of the Metro channel.        
	As long as the police plead impotence, the chief minister stars in traffic-stopper rallies here and his arch rival picks this as her fasting bed, the Metro channel is doomed to remain a road to avoid.

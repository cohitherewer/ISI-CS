The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Ravaged roads Part II
                                                                                                               Ravaged roads Part II
          
	Craters are strewn across the EM Bypass, the 14km high-speed corridor from the north to the south of the city and a vital link to the airport arteries. We repair the Bypass throughout the year, as and when necessary. However, the road surface is eroded by rain. I have got reports about the condition of the road. We have plans to repair the potholes and peeled-off portions before Puja and re-lay parts of the thoroughfare later, says Debdas Bhattacharya, a senior official of the traffic and transport wing of the CMDA, which maintains the corridor. Here are portions of the road where the monsoon has left its mark:

	The rainy season has taken a heavy toll on this busy stretch of the Bypass. The Ambedkar bridge is the worst-affected, with craters dotting its 350m length. Road engineers say the stretch is repaired often, but with material of poor quality                        
	Ruby rotary        
	Motorists have to dodge a number of craters to negotiate the stretch near the Ruby rotary. The road has been in this condition from the beginning of the monsoon but the authorities made no effort to repair it. Most of the surface has peeled off during the heavy rain over the past few days, slowing down traffic and causing regular snarls                        
	Hudco crossing        
	Uneven road surface poses as many problems for motorists at the northern end of the Bypass as barricades for the construction of a flyover. Stone chips fly off the tyres of passing vehicles posing a threat to pedestrians. Traders in the area claim that they filled up a large crater with concrete after the authorities took no action                        
	Chingrihata crossing        
	Craters and potholes mark one of the busiest crossings on the Bypass. Cops and motorists blame the state of the road on the rain and hasty patchwork by the CMDA. According to an officer of the nearby Beleghata traffic guard, minor mishaps have become a daily affair because of the eroded surface of the road                          TEXT BY TAMAGHNA BANERJEE; PICTURES BY SANJOY CHATTOPADHYAYA

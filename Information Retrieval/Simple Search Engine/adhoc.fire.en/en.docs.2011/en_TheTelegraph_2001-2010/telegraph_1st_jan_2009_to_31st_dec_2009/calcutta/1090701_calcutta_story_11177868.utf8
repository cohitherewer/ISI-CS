The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Trader throttled in front of wife in Howrah highrise
                                                                                                               Trader throttled in front of wife in Howrah highrise
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Four armed men strangled a trader to death, brutally assaulted his wife and two maids, and looted the victims apartment in a Howrah highrise on Tuesday morning.        
	Neighbours found Kalicharan Gupta, 42, with his hands and feet tied, and the torn bedsheet with which he was strangled still around his neck. Wife Reshmi, 35, and the maids  mother and daughter Santi and Mira  lay on the floor bruised and bleeding.        
	I looked at the battered faces and froze. There was blood on the floor, and pieces of furniture were lying upside down. It was brutal, said Rajib Dagga, among the first to answer Reshmi Guptas muffled cries for help.        
	The robbery-and-murder occurred in a seven-storeyed apartment at 23/2 Dobson Road, a busy commercial-cum-residential locality.        
	Kalicharan, who used to deal in watches, was getting ready to go to his shop at Radha Bazaar in the citys central business district when the doorbell to his second-floor flat rang. It was around 8.30am, and our sons Ashish and Harsh (aged 12 and 5) had left for school. I was in the kitchen when the bell rang, and I thought Santi and Mira had come. Then I heard my husbands muffled cry, police quoted Reshmi as saying.        
	The goons, said to be in their early twenties, had apparently barged in the moment Kalicharan opened the door and locked the grille from inside. I peeped out of the door and saw them pointing pistols at my husband and demanding Rs 10 lakh. When he said there was no money in the house, they hit him with the pistol butts, Reshmi said.        
	By the time the homemaker reached the living room, the four pistol-wielding men had gagged her husband with a shoe and dragged him to an adjacent room where they used a dupatta to tie him up.        
	Reshmi hurled a chair at them in a desperate attempt to save her husband, inviting instant retaliation. They hit her repeatedly with pistol butts, tied her up with a crepe bandage and stuffed a piece of cloth into her mouth.        
	The doorbell rang a second time just when the robbers were looking for the keys to the almirahs. This time it was the maids.        
	I suspected something was wrong when an unidentified person opened the door. He and one of his accomplices dragged me and my mother in and started assaulting us. We tried to scream for help but they tied and gagged us quickly, recalled Mira, 18.        
	Kalicharan, his wife and the two maids could only watch as the robbers then went about opening the almirahs and stuffing whatever they thought was valuable into a bag.        
	After collecting the booty, the four armed men turned on Kalicharan again.They hit him again and again before killing him, cried Reshmi.                    Kalicharan Gupta		      
	The gang tore a bedsheet, rolled it like a rope and strangled the trader in front of his wife.        
	According to the FIR lodged with Howrah police station, they changed into fresh clothes from Kalicharans wardrobe to avoid being seen in blood-stained attire. They walked out of the apartment a little later.        
	The muffled screams of Reshmi and the maids reached neighbours well after the raiders had fled, leaving the door ajar.        
	Some neighbours and I took Kalicharan to a local nursing home, where he was declared dead, said neighbour Dagga.         
	The superintendent of police in Howrah, Niraj Kumar Singh, confirmed that investigators had found strangulation marks on Kalicharans neck.        
	He was also repeatedly assaulted. We would need the post-mortem report to confirm whether he died of injuries suffered in the assault or because of strangulation, he told Metro.        
	Police said they were yet to find out how much cash and valuables were stolen.        
	Rimi, a German Shepherd requisitioned from the Government Railway Police, led investigators to Dobson Road and Burn Salt Gola Lane after sniffing two blood-stained towels in the Gupta apartment.        
	Dog handler Nabin Malik said the robbers had probably split into two pairs while fleeing. The buildings guard, Omprakash Jaiswal, has been detained.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Clash at bus stand
                                                                                                               Clash at bus stand
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Six men were injured in a clash between supporters of the CPM and Trinamul Congress over the control of a bus union at Poraashwathatala near Thakurpukur on Thursday morning.        
	The trouble broke out after a number of bus-owners at the route 21 and 21/1 stand recently switched allegiance to the Indian National Trinamul Trade Union Congress, said police. The CPMs labour wing Citu has controlled the stands union for decades.         
	Buses have not been operating on the two routes over this issue for three weeks. On Thursday, around 20 bus-owners tried to restart the services by tying Trinamul flags to their buses, when Citu supporters intervened, said Asit Chowdhury, a resident of the area.        
	Cops said over 100 supporters later clashed with iron rods, tubes and bricks.        
	About 100 Trinamul supporters held up the peak-hour traffic on Diamond Harbour Road from 10am, demanding arrest of the CPM men. The Rapid Action Force dispersed the protesters around 11.30am.

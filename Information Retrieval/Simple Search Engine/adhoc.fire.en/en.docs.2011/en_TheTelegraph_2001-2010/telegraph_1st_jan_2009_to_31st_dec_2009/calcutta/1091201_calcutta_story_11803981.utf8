                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Strategic strikes on tech hub, travel path

	Minimum effort for maximum impact was Mondays disruption mantra as the BJP bandh brigade targeted strategic installations and stretches, ranging from the DLF building to the roads to the airport.        
	Around 8.30am, 50-odd bandh enforcers armed with saffron and green, lathi and brickbat, blocked the mouth of the Rajarhat Expressway to choke traffic bound for IT offices and the airport. They damaged eight vehicles before turning on the DLF building, that houses IBM and more.        
	They stopped employees at the gates and smashed the security kiosks at gates 1, 3 and 4. They forcibly closed the gates and demonstrated outside for over 45 minutes, said security officer Rajat Das.        
	The morning mayhem ensured a dip in attendance figures at the DLF building and in Sector V. Such violence targeted at the IT sector was a first and came as a shock. It sends out dangerous signals, said Kalyan Kar, the managing director of Acclaris.        
	But the government, guilty of allowing hooligans to run riot, remained in denial. The sector faced no disruption of work, Siddharth, the principal secretary of IT.        
	Just after the Rajarhat road to the airport was blocked, another gang descended on the Baguiati-VIP Road crossing. This is a critical crossroads. Even if we block this for 30 minutes, there will be a lot of disruption, said Babulal Prasad, before rushing off to stop an airport-bound hatchback.        
	Forty-five minutes of roadblock later, VIP Road was a sea of stranded vehicles.        
	Air Indias Calcutta-Delhi-London flight was delayed by 20 minutes, due to the late arrival of passengers and crew, said an airline official.         
	Passengers arriving at the airport were greeted by the shut booths of the pre-paid service operated by the Bengal Taxi Association. Police or the airport authorities did not bother to help, said R. Agarwal, who arrived on an IndiGo flight from Mumbai.         
	Train services and passengers were hit with bandh supporters adopting the age-old tactic of blocking tracks. The Rajdhani Express, Kanchenjungha Express, Bhagirathi Express, Santiniketan Express and other trains were delayed. In the Sealdah division, the blockades were on till 12.30pm, in the Howrah divisions, they were lifted by 11.30am.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | New Year date for Bypass hospital
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      New Year date for Bypass hospital
          SUBHRO SAHA                          An artists impression of Medica Superspeciality Hospital in Mukundapur, which will be unveiled in the New Year                                  
	A superspeciality hospital off the EM Bypass will open doors in the New Year.        
	The Rs 100-crore Medica Superspeciality Hospital, behind Metro Cash and Carry in Mukundapur, will start off with 320 beds in mid-January and subsequently add 180 more beds.        
	The hospital, which has recently softlaunched its OPD, will also possibly be the citys first green hospital, having applied for LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification developed by the US Green Building Council.        
	The management claims the hospital will offer advanced treatment and services at rates 30-60 per cent cheaper than what other private hospitals in the city charge.        
	When we conceptualised the superspeciality hospital, one of our thoughts was to create a facility that does not look, feel or smell like a hospital. So we have bright colour schemes, cheerful paintings and soothing landscape, said Alok Roy, the chairman and managing director of Medica Synergie Pvt Ltd, the group of healthcare professionals which has developed the hospital.        
	The centre will have dedicated superspeciality hubs in cardiac sciences, neuro-sciences, nephrology, orthopaedics (including spine and joints) and gastroenterology. In addition, it will have an advanced emergency unit that can provide 100 per cent pre-hospital trauma and cardiac care to patients. We will offer advanced stabilisation on site, treatment all the way to the hospital and minimum time from door to OT, said Sudeep Bhattacharjee, the emergency room administrator, who has 18 years experience in emergency care in New York.        
	Trained health hostesses will escort each patient across the hospital premises, while a pneumatic chute system will ensure quick and efficient movement of path lab samples. These and the picture-archiving and communication system, which enables doctors to access all imaging records on their computers, are other firsts in Calcutta, according to the Medica brass.        
	The Cath Labs, critical care units and intensive care units are all housed on the same level to ensure theres only horizontal movements of medical intensive-care patients, cutting out the need for vertical movements, which is extremely traumatic for such patients.         
	There will be a large network of ambulances equipped with emergency-handling resources stationed at strategic locations across the city, covering approximately a 5km radius each, so as to reach out to the maximum number of emergency patients, said Udayan Lahiry, the head of operations for the hospital.        
	According to Lahiry, Medica Superspeciality is perhaps the only hospital in the country where the entire structure has double-glazed vacuum-filled glass to bring light in and keep heat out.        
	We have done this because artificial lighting disrupts the patients biological clock, he added.

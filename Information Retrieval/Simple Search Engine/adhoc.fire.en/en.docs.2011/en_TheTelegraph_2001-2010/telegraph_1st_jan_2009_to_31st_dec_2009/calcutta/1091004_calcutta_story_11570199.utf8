The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Lots of green talk
                                                                                                               Lots of green talk

	Global warming may continue unabated, but the Puja this year showed the citys eagerness to highlight climate change issues. More than 20 major pujas used various aspects of climate change as themes.         
	They showcased themes from the importance of greenery to afforestation, from the sea level rise to global warming, says an official of the environment department involved with the departments green award started three years ago.         
	The department had installed environment booths, calling them Sabuj Thikana (Green Destination), across the city with climate change as the focal theme. Climate addas, among other things, were held there. But are we only talking?        
	It is good that climate was a focus during Puja, but we need to ensure that awareness translates into action after all the city is qualified as one of the most vulnerable areas to climate change impact, said Sanjay Wadvani, British deputy high commissioner of Eastern India after inaugurating a climate kiosk.         
	Biswajit Mukherjee, the chief law officer of the environment department, was forthright. Puja committees, many of which are led by political heavyweights, hardly take any stand against environmental pollution, be it polluting vehicles or sponge iron factories in Durgapur, he says.        
	Maniktala Chaltabagan or FD Block in Salt Lake extensively used energy conserving lights and overall, LED lamps were quiet popular, says Krishnajyoti Goswami, an environment expert.         
	The clubs find no fault with themselves. Millions of pandal hoppers are made aware of the importance of keeping greenery or global warming by our pandals. The pujas are a celebration and implementation of green norms throughout the year is the governments responsibility, says Arup Biswas, a Trinamul MLA and mainstay of Suruchi Sangha, whose climate change-inspired pandal was a big hit this year.                     JAYANTA BASU

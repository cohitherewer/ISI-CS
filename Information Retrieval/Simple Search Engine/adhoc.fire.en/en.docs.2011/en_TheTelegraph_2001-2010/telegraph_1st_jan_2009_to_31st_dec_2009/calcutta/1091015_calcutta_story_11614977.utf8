	Metro Railway services were stalled for the second time in a week when a device to draw power from the third rail came off a Dum Dum-bound rake at Jatin Das Park station on Wednesday morning.        
	Rush-hour commuters had a harrowing time as trains could not run between Maidan and Garia Bazar (Kavi Nazrul) stations between 9.50am and 10.54am, shortly after a probe panel filed a report on a similar glitch in service last Thursday.        
	The services are being disrupted almost every other day ever since the route beyond Tollygunge was opened on August 23. Why did they inaugurate the extended route in such haste since its apparent they did not have the infrastructure to run trains from Dum Dum to Garia Bazar, asked Pradip Basu, a Metro commuter who was forced on Thursday morning to take a taxi to his central Calcutta office from Kalighat.        
	Trains, however, plied normally between Maidan and Dum Dum.        
	A third rail current collector  each coach has two such devices  came off a Dum Dum-bound train while it was entering Jatin Das Park station and got stuck in the third rail. The train could still have made the journey but the motorman, wiser after last weeks glitch, decided to get the coach inspected first, said a source.        
	On October 8, a motorman drove a train with a faulty current collector at Birji (where rakes change tracks), shifting the alignment of the third rail and setting off a chain reaction that disrupted service on the extended route for more than three hours.        
	Once the snag was detected on Thursday, the passengers were evacuated and the train was sent to the Noapara car shed.        
	More than half the Metro coaches are 25 years or older. Most of the coaches that are developing snags have crossed the use-by date. The problem has been compounded since the inauguration of the extended route which has left the coaches overworked, resulting in current collectors coming off rakes, said an official.        
	Metro officials refused to comment on the report on last weeks snag. The rake that had developed the snag was pressed into service on Monday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A question of inclusion
                                                                                                               A question of inclusion
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Andre Beteille (left) with governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi at Vidya Mandir. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                  
	Is it possible to have an inclusive society? Sociologist Andre Beteille, who was born in Chandernagore, shifted to north Calcuttas Raja Dinendra Street and studied in Brahmo Boys School, then made a conscious decision to study in an elite institution in south Calcutta, St Xaviers College, had a few answers to that one on Friday evening.        
	Delivering the fifth annual lecture of The New India Foundation, presented by The Telegraph, Beteille dwelt at length on the state of the universities and centres of academic research in India that have tried to achieve social inclusion but failed to maintain the standards of learning.        
	There seems to be an inherent contradiction between achieving a socially inclusive institution and maintaining its standard of excellence, observed the sociologist who felt that the standard of PhD theses in Indian universities was abysmally low. It might be difficult to achieve social inclusion without compromising on standards of excellence, but it is definitely do-able.        
	Beteille prescribed a more inclusive society but warned that bringing about statutory laws for inclusion would not yield results unless customs change. Societal exclusion has been practised most extensively and continuously for a very long time and exclusion is legitimised and justified.         
	Beteille did hold out hope saying things have been changing in India, though not rapidly. Rituals and practices have been eroded considerably by the new education system and the new occupational system.        
	He, however, cautioned that while social exclusion was eroding in society it was strengthening in politics and becoming increasingly more assertive. Beteille prescribed two ways to avoid this: expanding rights and capacities of citizens and following the path of identity politics.        
	Nandan Nilekani, co-chairman of Infosys Technologies, while introducing Beteille said: Andre was the natural choice to deliver The New India Foundation annual lecture in Calcutta.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pavement hurdle in Sec V

	A 35-year-old accountant walking along a Sector V road was crushed by a bus recently. Police had blamed the mishap on the absence of footpaths in the Salt Lake tech hub and speeding vehicles on some stretches. Metro drove through Sector V to explore the problem points:              
	Missing footpath         
	The stretch between Wipro and the College crossing, lanes off the Webel intersection and the road between Nicco Park and SDF building are devoid of footpaths.        
	The official number of pedestrians in the area on an average day is between 25,000 and 30,000. Most pedestrians are forced to risk their lives by walking down the carriageway.        
	Those who have to walk to their office or go out for food face the risk of being run over. We informed the Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority (NDITA) about the problems caused by the absence of footpaths. The authorities should take the issue seriously or more accidents will occur, said Kalyan Kar, the vice-president of the Sector V stakeholders association.        
	Illegal parking         
	The authorities have put up parking punished signs on footpaths but hardly pull up anyone for the offence.        
	Cars, two-wheelers and even goods vehicles are found parked on footpaths, including the one opposite the police outpost.        
	At places, cars were even seen parked in double lanes eating up a portion of the main carriageway.        
	It is so difficult to walk in Sector V. There are no proper footpaths and illegally parked cars occupy the space beside the carriageway. I was knocked down from behind by a speeding car a couple of months ago and was lucky to have escaped with minor injuries on my legs. But an IT sector of this stature must have walking bays, said Shatabdi Chakraborty, who works for a company in the tech hub.        
	Other encroachments        
	The authorities have recently replaced garbage vats with large plastic bags but have not demolished the concrete structures. As a result, people still throw garbage in the vats.        
	Building materials are piled on the footpaths at several spots, forcing people to walk down the carriageway. Making matters worse, illegal eateries have mushroomed across the tech hub.        
	Every month, we hear of at least 15 to 20 incidents of pedestrians suffering minor injuries after being hit by vehicles. Neither drivers nor pedestrians can be blamed for such incidents. If the authorities clear the footpaths, the number of such incidents will surely decrease, said an officer of the Sector V police outpost.        
	Speeding vehicles        
	Vehicles speeding between the Wipro and the College crossing, Nicco Park and SDF building, and the Wipro crossing and Technopolis pose a threat to the pedestrians forced to walk down the carriageway because of absence of footpaths.         
	The cops are hardly seen manning traffic and booking drivers for speeding. Minor accidents have become very common, said Rohini Chowdury, a New Town resident who works in a Sector V company.        
	Official word        
	We have started a drive to remove encroachments from the footpaths. We would concrete the footpaths once the drainage, sewage and water pipeline work is completed. We have sought speed governors so that the district police can enforce speed limits, said S.A. Ahmed, the chairman of Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority, the administrative authority of the tech hub.

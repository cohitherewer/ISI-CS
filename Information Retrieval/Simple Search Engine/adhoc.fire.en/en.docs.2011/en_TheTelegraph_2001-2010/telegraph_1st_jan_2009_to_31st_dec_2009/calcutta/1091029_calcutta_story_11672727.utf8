                      Melancholic melodies from the distant land                    Once someone said/ That fado put to sleep/ Those who heard its moaning/ That fado takes away our energies/ That it takes away our happiness/ That it is a song of the defeated/ It is a heresy, it is a sin/ To say such things about fado/ To make such a statement/ If fado is sad, when it is sung/ It only brings to tears/ Those who have a heart.        Fado (Portuguese:destiny, fate) is a music genre which can be traced from the 1820s in Portugal, but probably with much earlier origins. In popular belief, fado is a form of music characterised by mournful tunes and lyrics, often about the sea or the life of the poor. However, in reality fado is simply a form of song which can be about anything, but must follow a certain structure. The music is usually linked to the Portuguese word saudade (loosely translated in English it could be understood as nostalgia felt while missing something or someone important), a word describing a sentiment. Joana Amendoeira is a new generation Fado Singer and one of the youngest singers to have specialised in this traditional classical genre of music. Recipient of many awards, she has performed extensively in Portugal and around the world. She has several record albums to her credit. A much acclaimed fadista, she has contributed to some of the top fado anthologies. Through her voice, Fado reaches unique, sublime moments, powered by her sensuous and moving harmonies. In 1994, she participated in the Lisbon Grand Fado Gala, where she received enthusiastic praise from the jury and the audience. She won the Female Interpreter Award at the Oporto Gala. From then on, she has been performing around Portugal and the world.

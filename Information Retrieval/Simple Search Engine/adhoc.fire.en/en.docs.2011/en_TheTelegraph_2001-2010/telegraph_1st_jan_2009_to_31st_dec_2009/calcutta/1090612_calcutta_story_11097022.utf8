The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fire at mall food court
                                                                                                               Fire at mall food court
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A fire broke out at the food court of Forum around 10.30am on Thursday, forcing the evacuation of scores of visitors and shop employees from the Elgin Road mall.        
	The internal firefighting team of Forum put out the flames in about 40 minutes but not before they had spread to most of the food court outlets through the chimney duct.         
	The authorities said there was no major damage. The mall reopened in the evening and footfall was normal. The food court will open in a couple of days.         
	The fire started from one of the counters at the food court. We pulled down the false ceiling in the kitchen area and fought the flames through openings in the duct. Our internal firefighting team extinguished the blaze by the time the fire brigade arrived, said Ujjal, the general manager of Forum.        
	Only a handful of visitors had turned up at the mall at that hour, most of them to watch the morning shows at INOX.        
	We were evacuated soon after we saw smoke coming out of the food court. Everything was organised and there was no panic, said an employee at a second-floor shop.         
	The fire damaged the kitchen area and the computers are not working after being sprayed with water, added Ujjal.        
	The fire services said the mall had precautionary measures in place.        
	Two tenders went to Forum but our firemen hardly had to do anything. Negligence was not the cause of the fire. The mall was well-equipped to handle such a blaze, said Gopal Bhattacharya, the director of fire and emergency services.         
	Store-owners said fire drills were held every week at the mall and power and gas lines are regularly checked.        
	There was, however, another fire at the food court a few years back. Last year, a fire had broken out at a shop window of a store in the mall.

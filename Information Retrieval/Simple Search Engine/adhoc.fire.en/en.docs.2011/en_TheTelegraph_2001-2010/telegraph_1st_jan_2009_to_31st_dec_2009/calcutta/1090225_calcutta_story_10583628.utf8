	Italian company ITD-ITD CEM Joint Venture on Tuesday was awarded the Rs 305-crore contract to lay a pipeline between Palta water works and Tallah pumping station.        
	Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya will flag off the project at Yatra Mancha in Bagbazar on Friday.        
	The company, hired for the modernisation of the city airport, has been given 30 months to lay the 26km pipeline.         
	Pipe on the 15.8km stretch under BT Road, between Parkside Road and Tallah, will be laid without digging trenches to ensure that traffic is not disrupted.

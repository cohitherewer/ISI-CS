The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | City links of extortion trio
                                                                                                               City links of extortion trio
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The three criminals arrested in the city on Saturday for allegedly extorting money from iron-scrap dealers across the country were regulars in Calcutta, according to police.         
	The trio from Jharkhand and Orissa were attempting to extort Rs 3 crore from the owner of a Howrah firm. Kallu Singh, Dipu Sharma and Siaram Sharma confessed to fleecing crores from other iron-scrap traders in the area who operated nationally.        
	They visited Bajrangbali Market, Ghusudi and Bhotbagan in Howrah several times in the past few years to target traders, who were too afraid to inform police, said an investigating officer.        
	The police claimed that Kallu was a close associate of Amit Chowdhury, a criminal from Jharkhand believed to be the mastermind of the racket. His henchmen allegedly murdered Kishenlal Jain, a Howrah trader, in 2007 for refusing to pay up.        
	In the same year, he was involved in the killing of a businessman in Bangalore, who was the highest bidder in an iron-scrap auction conducted by South Eastern Railway.        
	Auctions are the cheapest way to buy iron-scrap. The three were part of a nation-wide gang of extortionists who do not allow material to be taken away from the auction site without being paid a hefty commission, said an officer investigating the case.         
	Jawaharlal Jaiswal, on whose complaint the three were arrested in central Calcutta, was the top bidder in an auction held in Rourkela last year. He purchased iron scraps from SAIL worth Rs 30 crore. The gang had demanded a 10 per cent commission from Jaiswal.

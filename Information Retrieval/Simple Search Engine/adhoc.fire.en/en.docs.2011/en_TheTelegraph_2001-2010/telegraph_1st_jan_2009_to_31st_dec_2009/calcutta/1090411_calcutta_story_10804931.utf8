The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Old boys to celebrate monk birth centenary
                                                                                                               Old boys to celebrate monk birth centenary
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Swami Lokeswarananda Maharaj                                  
	The alumni of Ramakrishna Mission Narendrapur have organised a programme at Science City on Sunday to commemorate the birth centenary of Swami Lokeswarananda Maharaj, the founder of the school.        
	We have organised a session of reminiscences about Swami Lokeswarananda. Chittatosh Mukherjee, a former chief justice of Bombay High Court, will preside over the session, said Prasanta Kumar Giri, the secretary of the alumni association.        
	On Saturday, the alumni will feed the poor at Narendrapur. An endowment fund in the memory of Swami Lokeswarananda will be set up later for funding the education of meritorious students from poor families at Narendrapur and its adjacent areas.        
	Thousands of alumni of the school and the many followers and admirers of the monk are expected to attend the programme at Science City. Swami Lokeswarananda was born Kanailal Bandyopadhyay on April 19, 1909, in what is now Bangladesh. He showed an inclination towards a spiritual life from an early age.        
	He came to Calcutta for higher education and joined the order of Ramakrishna after graduation.        
	Swami Lokeswarananda became the headmaster of Ramakrishna Mission Vidyapith, Deoghar. He later became the head of the Ramakrishna Mission Students Home at Pathuriaghata. The home was shifted to Narendrapur in the 1950s.

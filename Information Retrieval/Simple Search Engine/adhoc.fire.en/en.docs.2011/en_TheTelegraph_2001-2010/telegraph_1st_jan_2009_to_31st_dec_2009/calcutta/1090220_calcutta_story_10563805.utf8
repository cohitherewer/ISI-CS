                      The confluence of Ganga and Padma                    The most liberating thing is breaking away from that myth of the artist as special unique individual - the solitary Kafka-like personality working away on their own and in suffering... it is far more enjoyable to discuss ideas with someone who has also invested in the work... (Matthew Dalziel). Exchanging, sharing and discussing ideas open up new vistas for the creator and help him to develop, branch out and grow further.Collaboration in art and ideas, like in other spheres, is the new mantra of the global village we call our home. The benefits of aesthetic dialogue through visual arts such as, paintings, graphics and sculptures are many, and there is enough scope for exploring these areas. In fact, this concept is close to heart for Bengali artists who share a common bond but remain torn apart by that impenetrable line of control that divides East and West of Bengal. However, from the Sunderbans to Kashmir, mangroves to glaciers  nature is as intense as ever, and so is art. This is evident in the on-going exhibition of paintings, Kolkata-Dhaka, where participants include a group of artists from both West Bengal and Bangladesh. Hosted jointly by Art Trust, Calcutta and Bengal Gallery of Fine Arts, Dhaka.                     Event: Kolkata-Dhaka  an exhibition of paintings When: Till February 22; 4 pm - 8 pm Where: Birla Academy of Art amp; Culture

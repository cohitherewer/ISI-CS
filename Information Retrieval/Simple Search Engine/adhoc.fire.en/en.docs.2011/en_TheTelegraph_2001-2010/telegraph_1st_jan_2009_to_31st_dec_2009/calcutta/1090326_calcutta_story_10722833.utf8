	A 24-year-old engineering student was found dead in the Bally home of his friend and bandmate in a death metal group on Tuesday afternoon after they spent the night jamming with two common friends as audience.        
	Ashis Banerjees brother-in-law Dibyendu Banerjee lodged a murder complaint with police on Wednesday afternoon. Abhishek Roy, the 22-year-old BCA student in whose house Ashiss body was found, and Arpan Banerjee and Suman Maity, the other two youths, were later detained.        
	Ashis, a final-year student of Academy of Technology at Adisaptagram in Hooghly, stayed with his parents in Agarpara in North 24-Parganas. His father Ranjitlal, an employee of the West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company, and Dibyendu identified the body on Wednesday morning after the post-mortem.         
	I do not know where Ashis met Abhishek and how they became close. I believe my son was murdered, said Ranjitlal.        
	We noticed injuries on Ashiss neck and other parts of his body. He was murdered in cold blood, said Dibyendu.        
	Bablu Dalui, a neighbour who saw Ashis being put into an ambulance, also said the student had sustained injuries on the neck and at the back of the left knee.        
	An unnatural death case had been started and the investigators were awaiting the post-mortem report        
	Abhishek told police during interrogation that he and Ashis were friends who had bonded over their love for music. They often used to jam through the night in Abhisheks home. Their death metal band used to play in college gigs.        
	Ashis was supposed to visit Abhisheks home on Monday evening. When he did not turn up by 8pm, I rang up Ashis. He appeared to be under the spell of drugs. He told me that he had no desire to live any more and wanted to end his life. I told him that he would feel better if he came over to my place and played some music. He reached our home after some time and we practised till late, the police quoted Abhishek as saying.        
	According to Abhishek, Arpan and Suman reached the house after Ashis. Around 12.30am, three of them had dinner while Ashis lay down, refusing to eat.        
	Abhishek and Ashis were sleeping when Arpan and Suman left the house around 10.30am the next morning. Abhishek claimed that he got up around 12.30pm while Ashis was still sleeping. At 4.30pm, when Abhishek tried to wake up Ashis, he found him dead.        
	Abhishek with the help of three friends rushed Ashis to Uttarpara State General Hospital, where he was declared brought dead.        
	Ashis was a drug addict and had brown sugar on Sunday night, alleged Abhishek.        
	Though he claimed that the four went to bed after midnight, morning-walkers said they heard guitar being played in the house around 6.30am.

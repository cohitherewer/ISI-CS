The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Protest by constables 
                                                                                                               Protest by constables 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	About 200 constables of the fifth battalion refused to work on Wednesday afternoon, demanding an apology from a senior officer who had allegedly misbehaved with one of them.         
	Several installations in the city were unprotected for over an hour before the deputy commissioner overseeing the battalion, Bhuban Mondal, persuaded the batch of constables to return to work.         
	On Tuesday afternoon, an assistant commissioner had allegedly thrown away a constables cellphone for continuing to use it in his presence.        
	Mondal will probe the allegation.

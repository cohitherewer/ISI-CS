The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | IIM seniors fare better
                                                                                                               IIM seniors fare better
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The downturn toll on executives completing a yearlong management course at IIM Calcutta has been less than on the fresh graduates who completed the two-year flagship course this year.        
	The average salary of the students passing the postgraduate programme for executives (PGPEX) has dipped by 10 per cent compared with last year, from Rs 20 lakh per annum to Rs 18 lakh.        
	The average salary of those who passed the flagship postgraduate programme (PGP) dropped by 20 to 25 per cent.        
	Mritunjoy Mohanty, the convener of the PGPEX placement sub-committee, said one reason for the lower drop in the average salary, compared with PGP graduates, was that maximum changes in salary structures during downturn took place at the entry level.        
	The average work experience of the students of the PGPEX course ranges from eight to nine years. On the other hand, PGP graduates are mostly fresh, said Mohanty.        
	Of the 37 students in the PGPEX batch, 34 took part in the placement process.        
	The institute also offered the deferred placement option to PGPEX graduates, which will allow them to avail themselves of the placement services in the next two years. Two students opted for deferred placement.        
	Though the average salary dipped only by 10 per cent, the highest domestic salary fell from Rs 45 lakh in 2008 to Rs 35 lakh this year. The effect of global downturn was also evident in the absence of foreign offers. Last year, five students got foreign offers.        
	We would have been happier had there been foreign offers but we dont see their absence as a worrying sign, said Mohanty.        
	Most of the offers, 31 per cent, came from the consulting companies such as McKinsey, Deloitte, IBM Consulting and PricewaterhouseCoopers.

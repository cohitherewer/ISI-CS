	Toyota, the worlds largest auto maker, is shoring up its dealership network by opening a second showroom in the city ahead of Diwali. This was announced by Arun Chhabra, the manager (east) of Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) at the launch of Fortuner, the companys latest SUV, in the city on September 1 at CC amp;FC.        
	The much-awaited Toyota small car, due at the beginning of 2011, is expected to bring in volumes for the Japanese player and the second dealership in the city is a preparation for that.         
	The compact car will be introduced in the Indian market in 2011 followed by a sedan. With these two new cars in our portfolio we are looking to having at a market share of 10 per cent by 2015. In the past 10 years, we had a 3.1 per cent market share, said Sanjay Gupta, the deputy general manager, (marketing division) of TKM.         
	The company, which has 86 dealers in the country, will expand the number to 150 by early-2011, said Gupta.        
	The new dealership to come up on the EM Bypass will be the largest Toyota showroom in the city, spread over 100,000sq ft with 3S (Sales, Service, Spares) facility.         
	The dealership will open by mid-October, said Amit Manaktala, the proprietor of Topsel Toyota, the sole Toyota dealer, at Mahestala. The new showroom will be spread over five floors with a 15,000sq ft showroom on the groundfloor that will showcase the entire Toyota range in India. An extended workshop spread over four floors and 60,000sq ft will have 60 work bays. It will be a green dealership with lots of trees. Customers will be able to drive to the shop floor, added Manaktala.        
	The eastern market that comprises West Bengal, the Northeast, Orissa, Sikkim and Jharkhand contributes about five per cent of the national sales figure.         
	In Calcutta, each month we sell 60 Innovas, the companys best-selling Multi-purpose Vehicle (MPV) and 40 Altis, the Toyota sedan that is in competition with the Honda Civic. And Camry sells 25 units per month, said Manaktala. The dealership has also sold 12 Prados and one Land Cruiser (priced at Rs 85 lakh), both of which were Completely Built-up Units (CBUs).        
	Launching Fortuner in the city, Chhabra said: We already have 42 bookings of the Fortuner in Calcutta.        
	In between the launch of the Fortuner and the small car in 2011, the company is likely to bring its hybrid vehicle, the Prius. We are in negotiations with the central government on the 105 per cent import duty imposed on CBUs, said Gupta         
	With Toyotas new dealership at EM Bypass, the two traditional Japanese rivals, Honda and Toyota will practically be next-door neighbours.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Booklets for short answers 
                                                                                                               Booklets for short answers 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The West Bengal State University (WBSU) in Barasat may introduce question paper-cum-answer sheet booklets for undergraduate examinations, doing away with the traditional system of separate question papers and answer scripts.         
	If the move is implemented, the students of all 57 colleges under the WBSU will have to write answers on the booklets and submit them.         
	The booklet will provide suitable space for each short and long answer-type question. There will also be multiple choice questions, to be answered with tick marks.        
	The WBSU  which will hold its first undergraduate exams this year  is planning to introduce the system in the current year. We have held preliminary talks on introducing the format. We will hold a workshop on March 24 with teachers, academicians and examination department officials to decide whether to change the exam pattern from this year, said WBSU vice-chancellor Ashoke Ranjan Thakur.        
	He admitted the concept was new in Bengal but said institutions like JNU and many foreign universities had been following the system for long.         
	The aim was to expedite the evaluation process, a source in WBSU said. Most students write unnecessarily long answers. In the new format, they can write only relevant points as there will be a limited space for each answer, said a teacher.        
	However, some teachers said that guarding the questions while the booklets were printed could be a problem and might lead to question leaks.

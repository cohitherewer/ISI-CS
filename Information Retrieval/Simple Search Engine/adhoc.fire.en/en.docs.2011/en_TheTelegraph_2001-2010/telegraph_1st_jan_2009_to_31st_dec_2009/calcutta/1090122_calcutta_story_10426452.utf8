	History:        
	The College of St. Francis Xavier was opened in 1834 at Moorghyhatta by Fr Chadwick, an English Jesuit. The institution was shifted to 3 Park Street in 1835. In 1840, Sans Souci Theatre was built on 10 Park Street for star Calcutta actress Esther Leach. It had a portico with beautiful Doric columns and a handsome flight of stairs leading to the hall.         
	In 1841, the college was shifted to 22 Chowringhee, where the Indian Museum now stands, to accommodate the increasing number of students.        
	The same year, Monsignor Carew landed in Calcutta to take charge of the affairs of the Catholic Church. In 1846, College of St. Francis Xavier closed down due to a feud between the Jesuits and Mgr Carew, and the Jesuits left the city.         
	In 1850, Sans Souci theatre caught fire and closed down. Mgr Carew bought the premises and transferred St. Johns College there from Entally. The endeavour, however, failed.         
	Mgr Carew died in 1855. Mgr Olliffe, the new bishop, travelled to England but failed to convince the English Jesuits to return to Calcutta. He then appealed to the Belgian Jesuits to look after the education of the Catholic community in the city.        
	On November 28, 1859, the Jesuits landed on the shores of the Charnock city and made 10 Park Street, the remains of Sans Souci theatre, their home.         
	It was advertised that the college would open on January 8, 1860, but opening was deferred by eight days. On January 16, 1860, the College of St. Francis Xavier was reborn as St. Xaviers College on 10 Park Street. The leader and founder was Fr Depelchin.         
	The premises on 30 Park Street, the present address for St Xaviers Senior School and College, is an amalgamation of 10 (where stood the remains of the Sans Souci theatre) and 11 Park Street.         
	The present imposing five-storey building was built over six years in the 1930s at a cost of Rs 9 lakh.        
	The money was collected partly from the public of Calcutta, assistance from Belgium and the huge rental received from the American army that occupied the building during the Second World War.              
	A few firsts:        
	Day in class: Fr Shea recollects events of the first class day in a write-up published in the college magazine, Xaverian, in 1926: The pupils assembled in the big hall. The names of the professors and their pupils were called out after which we marched off to class with all the order and pomp of a well-regulated Belgian college. We entered and found... What? A set of benches to sit on; but desks for the pupils, chair or table for the master, blackboard, pen and ink and paper, all were conspicuous by their absence I looked at the boys and they at me. Happily, I noticed Fr Deynoodt, who was walking in the large open hall below I called him and saw him walk up to me with all the dignity of a canon. Please send us some slates, I said. He took a meditative air and Yes, I have been thinking of that, was his answer.        
	Cricket match: St. Xaviers College (a team that would boast of Sourav Ganguly in its ranks some 125 years later) versus Doveton College on November 23, 1860.                   
	Christmas, 1860: The boys presented a large carpet to the chapel, a tradition that the schools old boys association, Alumnorum Societas or ALSOC, started in 1932 by Rabindranath Tagore and revived in 1976, is carrying forward.

	1912: Many Xaverians enrolled in the English and French armies for the First World War. Those who did not go to the front as soldiers went either as doctors or played major roles behind the scene.

	1917: The Hindu Hostel opened on Lower Circular Road with 60 seats.

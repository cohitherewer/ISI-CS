The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Power snag rerun in Buddha locality 
                                                                                                               Power snag rerun in Buddha locality 
          A STAFF REPORTER                               The stretch dug up by the civic body and (above) Broad Street resident Monojit Barari. Telegraph pictures				                                 
	Pockets of the chief ministers locality plunged into darkness for nearly six hours on Thursday following a snag in the underground cable.         
	CESC officials blamed the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) for damaging the cable near the Broad Street-Rifle Range Road crossing, leading to disruption in power supply from 8.45am.        
	The civic body is laying water pipes on the stretch. This is the second time civic workers have damaged the cable in a week. We have asked the CMC authorities to exercise caution while undertaking such work on the stretch, said a CESC official.        
	According to him, the CESC authorities wrote to CMCs executive engineer (borough VII) Anindya Ghose after the disruption in power supply in the area last weekend prompted resident Monojit Barari, a BSNL engineer, to sit on a chair in the middle of Broad Street as the chief ministers convoy was about to cross the stretch. Barari relented after policemen promised to do everything to restore power to his house. The supply resumed within half an hour of the protest. On Thursday, Ghose said workers engaged by the civic body were laying water pipes on a stretch of Broad Street but denied that they had damaged the cable. He claimed that he had not received any letter from CESC.        
	The workers engaged by us stumbled upon the underground cable while digging the stretch. They immediately stopped work and informed CESC officials, who reached the spot and secured the cable, said Ghose.         
	The executive engineer also denied that the civic workers had damaged electricity cables last weekend.        
	Our employees rushed to the spot immediately after being alerted by residents and started repairing the damaged cable. Power supply was restored around 2.30pm, said a CESC official.         
	Residents, however, alleged that the contractors engaged by the CMC did not make any effort to avoid damaging power cables while digging roads. The civic workers cannot care less about disrupting power supply. The water pipe is being laid over the past two weeks and the power cable has already been damaged twice, said Rahmat Ali, a resident of the area.

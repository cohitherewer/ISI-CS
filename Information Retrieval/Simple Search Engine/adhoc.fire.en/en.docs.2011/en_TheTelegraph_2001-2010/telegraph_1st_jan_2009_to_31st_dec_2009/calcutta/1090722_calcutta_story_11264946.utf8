The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rally boost for black brolly
                                                                                                               Rally boost for black brolly
          MEGHDEEP BHATTACHARYYA                          A cluster of umbrellas at Tuesdays rally. (Amit Datta)                                  
	Flags and festoons were few and far between. Banners and bandannas also seemed in short supply at Mamata Banerjees rally in the heart of the city, but not umbrellas, especially black ones.         
	Though the weather god was kind to the Trinamul Congress and didnt wash out its programme on Martyrs Day as the Met office had predicted, there were intermittent spells of rain, adding up to 24.6mm.        
	Umbrella sellers in the Esplanade area cashed in with their wares flying off the pavement between 1pm and 3pm.         
	I usually sell between five and 10 umbrellas a day during the monsoon. Today I sold 37. I made over Rs 1,500. This is the best day ever! said a jubilant Alam Khan, a 62-year-old hawker on Lenin Sarani.        
	Having exhausted his stock, he packed up and headed home at 3pm, five hours earlier than usual.        
	Kanai Ghosh, 32, too was happy to shut shop earlier than usual, having sold out his stock of umbrellas. Even during the rains, I usually find 10-odd customers in a day, buying not more than 15 umbrellas. The sales were incredible today. There were over 50 customers who bought 62 umbrellas. I made around Rs 2,500 in less than two hours, Ghosh said at his makeshift stall near Bidhan Market.        
	He said he would go shopping for his wife and little daughter with the extra cash.        
	From the roof of one of the buildings near the venue, one could look down on a sea of a few lakh heads, a large percentage of them under umbrellas.         
	Some carried them from home. Most didnt and bought them at the venue for a song.         
	I lost my umbrella in the Metro on my way to the rally. I had to buy one to protect myself from the rain; I just recovered from pneumonia, said Dum Dum resident Pratap Mitra.        
	Priced between Rs 30 and Rs 120, umbrellas of every size and hue were a sell-out, but the colour black was the pop pick.        
	I bought a black umbrella because it doesnt appear dirty despite repeated use. I bought this one for Rs 35. Back home we dont get such good quality umbrellas so cheap, said Ruposhi Modak, 38, a Trinamul activist from Howrahs Pero.        
	Hawkers of Calcutta have for long treated every rally, meeting or protest march as a fair and peddled their wares with glee  from clothes to posters, junk jewellery to fruits. But Tuesday was all about the umbrella.         
	The popularity of the umbrella on Tuesday amused Trinamul leaders too. Party leader Ranajit Mondal said: I was quite amused to learn about the umbrella sales, but not surprised. There wasnt heavy rain, thankfully, but it drizzled quite a bit. Most people got drenched.

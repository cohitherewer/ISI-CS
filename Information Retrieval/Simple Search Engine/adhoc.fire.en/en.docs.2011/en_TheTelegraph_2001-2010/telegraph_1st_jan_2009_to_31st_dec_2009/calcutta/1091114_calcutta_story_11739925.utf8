                      Flower power                    Plants and flowers around the house create an atmosphere of informality, cordiality and cheerfulness. They also add an elegant, tasteful and picturesque touch to any environment. From corporate boardrooms to bedrooms, flowers help to generate a suitable ambience. Besides, they are also beneficial to the environment, cleansing the air and resisting irregular climate changes. House plants fulfil the need of a healthier living environment, and beautify the space around us. The real value of house plants lies in their use as decoration for indoor spaces. House plants create a natural sense of coziness. Properly used, they can make large spaces look intimate and magnify small spaces to create an impression of depth. It is hard to imagine a decor that does not call for at least a few house plants placed in the right spots. The need or demand for house plants is very high in cities like Calcutta, where high-rises leave no space for planting trees or the development of sufficient greenery. It is with this thought in mind that Agri-Horticultural Society of India is hosting its annual House Plants Expo, showcasing the possibilities of beautifying interiors with house plants. Many renowned interior decorators and realty companies have set up stalls within the facilities at the show. The exhibitors have simulated the look and feel of rooms for residential and official purposes, placing flowers and house plants suitably, and bringing out the aesthetics of using them for home and office decoration.                  Event: An exhibition of house plants When: Till November 15; 7 am - 8 pm Where: Agri-Horticultural Society of India, Main Lawn and HB Kanoi Exhibition Hall, 1 Alipore Road

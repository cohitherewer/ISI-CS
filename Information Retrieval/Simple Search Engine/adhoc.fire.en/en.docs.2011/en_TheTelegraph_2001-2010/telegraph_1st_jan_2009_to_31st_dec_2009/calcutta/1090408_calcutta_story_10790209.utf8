The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sprawl of illegal units
                                                                                                               Sprawl of illegal units
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The charred remains of the factory. (Amit Datta)                                  
	Most of the 75-odd units operating out of the Belgachhia Rajbari premises, where a factory caught fire on Tuesday leading to three deaths, do not have a licence, alleged residents.        
	The factories have been operating illegally under the nose of the civic administration and police. We live in perpetual risk, said Dibyendu Mukherjee, a tenant of the Rajbari.        
	The units are a major safety hazard, said Gaurango Pal, a resident of the neighbourhood.        
	The police seem to be aware of the rule violation but pass the inaction buck to the fire department.        
	We have come to know that the owners of the Rajbari have been leasing out space. Many of the lessees have been running illegal factories but we cannot do anything unless informed by the fire department, said an officer of Ultadanga police station.        
	Fire minister Pratim Chatterjee said it was not possible for his officials to track every illegal factory.        
	But now that the mishap has occurred, I have asked the officials to find out how many illegal units are operating from the Rajbari premises and take stern action against them, Chatterjee added.        
	The Rajbari owners could not be reached for comments.

                                                                                                               For SRK, love amp; prayers in KKR country
  - Shah Rukh fan club plans special birthday, Sourav says he will wish superstar personally          MOHUA DAS                          The shrine at the SRK Fan Club on birthday eve. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                        
	Shah Rukh Khan the superstar enters a make-or-break year on Monday  and 375 of his die-hard fans in Calcutta are seeking divine intervention to beat his 44th birthday blues.        
	SRK has been facing some personal and professional problems recently, so we thought of beginning the day with puja and rituals for him. We want him to emerge as the number one hero again, said Arnab Roy, secretary of the 12-year-old Shah Rukh Khan Fan Club, at the thermocol-and-plywood shrine built for their screen god in Rajarhat.        
	As he steps into his 45th year, the beleaguered badshah of Bollywood is battling a below-par box office, two Khans gunning for him, a Kumar packing a punch, a Roshan going strong, a host of young actors flexing their muscles, his endorsement count dropping and his Kolkata Knight Riders on a losing streak. Reason enough for his fan club in KKR country to pray for his success, on screens big and small and on the cricket pitch.        
	It took regular meetings every Sunday to plan it and one week to put together this 6ft-by-4ft temple created by pandal artisans from Girish Park. This is our gift to SRK and the puja is for his continued reign at the top, his familys well being and for KKR to emerge champions at IPL 2010, said Roy.                  Sourav with daughter Sana at her eighth birthday party on Sunday evening      
	There will be a daylong puja at the Rajarhat address complete with a yagna at an altar painted in KKRs black-and-gold colours. The post-puja party will see actress Pallavie cutting the three-tier birthday cake. I was hoping to talk to him on his birthday, but Im happy to be celebrating it here. His spirit and positive energy have always made him popular in our city and after KKR there is an emotional attachment. Everyone feels like theyre part of his family, gushed Prosenjits sister, who described herself as an ardent fan.        
	Four members of the SRK Fan Club have reached Mumbai with a bottle of champagne, boxes of chamcham, rosogolla and sonpapri, a bouquet of flowers and a cake, to be handed over to the birthday boy at Mannat.        
	But the one birthday wish from Calcutta that Shah Rukh will look forward to the most will be from his KKR skipper. And he will not be disappointed. Yes, I will personally wish him on Monday, said Sourav Ganguly, while celebrating daughter Sanas eighth birthday on Sunday evening.

                Relatives of a patient admitted to Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratishthan ransacked a part of the hospital on Friday morning, alleging wrong treatment. Cops were called in to control the situation after 200-odd people broke glass panes and flowerpots. Relatives said Nilu Ghosh was diagnosed with brain tumour after doctors examined his CT scan and MRI reports. But when his condition deteriorated, we consulted a neurosurgeon from SSKM Hospital who did not find any tumour, said Santu Naskar, a relative.  he secretary of the hospital, Swami Sarvalokananda, said: The tests could not tell us conclusively whether it was a tumour or a clot. We could not conduct a surgery because the patient was weak. Ghosh was on ventilator till Friday evening.    A 45-year-old man who had served in the army tried to set himself ablaze at his Purbachal apartment in Salt Lake on Friday. Cops said the man had doused himself in kerosene before lighting a fire. He was taken to Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals with 20 per cent burns. He was reported to be stable. Neighbours said he was suffering from depression.    An assistant sub-inspector of Karaya police station suffered serious injuries after being knocked down by an autorickshaw on the eastern flank of No. 4 bridge in Park Circus early on Friday. Bishu Deb Banerjee was taken to Calcutta National Medical College by the cops and later shifted to Calcutta Medical Research Institute. The auto was found abandoned in front of Kohinoor Market on the Park Circus connector. Banerjee was checking vehicles when the auto knocked him down.    Sambhu Ash, 37, a rickshaw-puller, was killed after a Rabindra Sadan-bound bus from Santragachhi hit the stationary rickshaw from behind on Kona Expressway around 8.30am on Friday. He was taken to Howrah District Hospital where he died after two hours. Police said the vehicle hit the rickshaw while trying to overtake another bus. The driver fled with the vehicle.    Mohammed Salim, 60, was injured after being knocked down by an unidentified vehicle at the Ramcharan Mullick Road-MG Road crossing on Friday afternoon. Cops said Salim had just got off a bus on route 71 when the car hit him from behind while trying to overtake the vehicle from the left. He was admitted to Medical College and Hospital with hand and waist injuries.     Five persons were injured after a private bus near Raghunathpur hit a Matador on Friday afternoon. Police said the accident occurred when the bus driver lost control and hit the Matador carrying mineral water and soft drink bottles. Three persons on the Matador and two pedestrians were injured. They were taken to a nursing home and discharged after first-aid.

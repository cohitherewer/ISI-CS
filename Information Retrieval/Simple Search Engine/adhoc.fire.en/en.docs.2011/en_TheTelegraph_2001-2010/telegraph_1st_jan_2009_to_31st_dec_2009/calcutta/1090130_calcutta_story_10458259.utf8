The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | X-ray delay at SSKM
                                                                                                               X-ray delay at SSKM
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	SSKM Hospital is asking outdoor patients in need of X-rays to come back after a couple of months. Excessive demand for the free service and shortage of paramedical staffers are the reasons, said the hospital authorities.        
	Kalpana Raut, a 56-year-old resident of Ballygunge suffering from back pain, was asked to undergo an X-ray by a doctor in an outdoor department on Thursday. When she approached the radiology department, she was asked to come back on April 17.        
	Mohan Srivastava, who has a broken steel pin stuck in his finger, was asked to return to the hospital for an X-ray around the same time. I dont want to wait till then and lose my finger. So I will obviously have to get the X-ray done outside, said the 24-year-old.         
	Pradip Mitra, the director of SSKMs Institute of Postgraduate Medicine and Research, said the volume of patients was too large for the hospital to handle.        
	Paramedics in the radiology department said on an average, about 750 turn up for X-rays daily.        
	There are seven X-ray machines in the department. The situation turned worse on Thursday when the lone X-ray machine on the ground floor, near the emergency department, broke down.We cannot increase the number of machines because there is no space to keep them. Moreover, each paramedic is permitted 20 exposures daily for health reasons, added Mitra.        
	Paramedics pointed to manpower shortage. There are 26 paramedic posts, but only 13 of us are on duty on an average day. We cannot be inhuman and refuse to perform more than 20 X-rays, thereby putting ourselves at radiation risks. Even Group D workers perform X-rays since we cannot keep up with the rush of patients.        
	Mitra said tests had been conducted to recruit paramedics. Sources in the department said there was also a shortage in supply of films needed for digital X-rays.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cross at crossing
                                                                                                               Cross at crossing
                              Temper zone? A Gariahat pavement                             
	There is something between me and the four-point Gariahat crossing that does not quite gel. For though I have lost count of the number of times I have been there, I do know that I have had some of my worst fights there too. It brings out the worst in me as it does in the people hanging out there.        
	Having grown up in Ballygunge, I could have hardly avoided Gariahat at any point in my life. I have travelled there as a kid with my mother to the bazar and helped her handpick potatoes and tomatoes. I blindly held her hand to cross the road, often slowing her down in the middle to take a longing look at the ice-cream cart. A child could throw a tantrum for an ice-cream in the middle of the road then and not be run over.         
	As one grew up, the hawkers spread caught the eye. I liked what I saw on the pavements, such as the red and white band for my schoolgirl head. Till college, I flirted with Gariahats sidewalks, a seductive array of beautiful things.         
	The affair was shortlived. As life became hectic and one ran to hail a bus or a cab, Gariahat grew to be less alluring. As a bus dropped me at the crossing one day, I stepped on a bright blue bag on display on the pavement. I felt guilty and harassed.         
	It worsened. On a sweltering Sunday evening before the Pujas last year, I was at Rashbehari Avenue just off Gariahat, parking my car on the lane beside a shop known for its kurtas. I got out to grab a cone of butterscotch from a vendor. The first bite melted in my mouth and I looked around appreciatively. But such bliss wouldnt last. Didi, gaadi ekhan theke shoriye nin. (Remove your car from here.) I looked around. There he was, a hefty fellow with bloodshot eyes in a crisp white kurta. Why? Is this a no-parking zone? I asked. Another yell. Shoriye nin! For gods sake, why? The exchange was getting heated. You have parked right in front of my shop, thats why! The man, and his white kurta, were from the kurta shop. By his logic the entire stretch of Rashbehari Avenue and Gariahat should be bereft of any parked cars.         
	My ice-cream had already melted and was dribbling down my fingers to collect in a puddle at my feet as I ranted. Have you taken parking rights to this place, have you paid the civic body for the space in front of your shop? Things turned worse as I found around me a sizeable crowd, shoppers and passersby staring at me with dropped jaws. Aapni mahila hoye erokom chitkar korchhen! (Youre a woman and yet you shout like this!) Honestly, had I lost all my senses? Standing in a busy thoroughfare, here I was screaming at someone at the top of my voice. Was it right? Was it decent? I wiped off the icecream and got into my car. Drained, confused, shaken, I drove off.        
	A few months later, I park again, this time in front of a bank with the parking attendant helping me. When I come back, I find a row of autorickshaws parked in double lines blocking my way. I ask the attendant to get them removed. A group of auto drivers still stand chatting in my way. I blow the horn and ease the clutch. The car moves an inch. A second later, my vehicle is surrounded. Amader dhakka marben naki?         
	I lost my cool yet again. Dont try to pick up a fight without reason. People gathered from nowhere. Aapni meyechhele bole chhede dilam (Since you are a woman, we are letting you go.) More followed. Paribartan esche, tai apnadero paribartan hochhe.         
	Gariahat More brings out the worst in me, in everybody.                           ANASUYA BASU

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Course scrap demand in JU
                                                                                                               Course scrap demand in JU
  - Students want international relations to be replaced with political science										      MITA MUKHERJEE      
	Several students and teachers of Jadavpur University have demanded that the postgraduate course in international relations, introduced 50 years ago, be scrapped and replaced with a masters course in political science.         
	The students are claiming that a masters degree in international relations could not fetch them a teachers job in political science in state colleges following a change in the college service commission rules.         
	We are in a fix because international relations is not taught at the undergraduate level in the state and the new rules do not treat us on a par with those who have done an MA in political science, said a final-year student of JUs international relations department, requesting anonymity.         
	JU does not have a postgraduate course in political science though it runs an honours course in the subject. Students who have passed honours in political science are eligible to apply for the masters course in international relations.         
	The demand for scrapping the international relations course  referred to the universitys executive council  however has run into opposition from experts as well as a section of students.         
	JUs international relations department is not just the oldest but also one of the best in the country. There is no reason why the university should scrap a course in which it has developed considerable expertise through five decades, said a member of JUs board of studies on the subject.         
	Departmental head Parthapratim Basu denied there was any demand for scrapping the course, saying some students had asked for restructuring the curriculum so more political science topics could be incorporated into it. The proposal is at an initial stage. Any change has to be ratified by the executive council, faculty council, university court and the University Grants Commission.        
	College service commission chairman Himangshu Ghosh said international relations students clearing the State Level Eligibility Test (SLET) could teach political science in colleges but those qualifying the National Eligibility Test in international relations and area studies could not. But unlike SLET, there is no NET only for international relations, which the national body always clubs with area studies.

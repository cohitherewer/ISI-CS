The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Boy spared ordeal
                                                                                                               Boy spared ordeal
                                  
	A seven-year old boy was spared the torment of spending a night at the isolation ward of the Infectious Diseases Hospital, Beleghata, on Sunday, and allowed to go home from the airport.         
	The boy had landed at Calcutta airport from Bangkok by an Air India Express flight with cough and cold. He was returning after a holiday with his parents and sister. He was allowed to go back to his Marquis Street home after doctors decided that his symptoms were not strongly similar to swine flu.        
	We didnt want to scare the boy, said a state health department official. Our health team will visit him on Monday and only if his condition worsens will he be taken to Beleghata.

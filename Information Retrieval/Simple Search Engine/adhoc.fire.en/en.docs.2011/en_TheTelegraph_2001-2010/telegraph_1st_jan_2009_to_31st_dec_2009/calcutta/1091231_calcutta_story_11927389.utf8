	How to beat the chill and look cool        
	Dev of designer duo Dev R Nil draws up style basics for you to be an eye-catcher rather than an eyesore on 31st night        
	FOR HER        
	Boat neck: Covering up is more sexy than exposing too much. Closed necklines, like a boat neck, look really cool.        
	Stockings: Pair with short dress or skirt. Opaque, not sheer, is in. Black is the evergreen choice. No peep toes please; stick to covered shoes, boots or pumps.        
	A good jacket: With skirt or trouser. Wear it long with a basic dress and stockings, keep it short with trousers.        
	Scarves: The perfect accessory, wear it as you will. For drama, pin it with a brooch.        
	Boots: Not too long, please. Go for matte leather or suede.        
	FOR HIM        
	Scarves: As much a fashion statement with guys as with girls. Tie it into a knot and tuck it inside your jacket for a cool effect.        
	A good jacket: Basic wool, felt or suiting. Even a linen one will do. Colour? Dark.        
	Layers: A fitted vest under the shirt will keep you warm and not look bulky either.        
	Bomber jackets: If you are headed for the discs.        
	Skinny denims and trousers: They are in and they keep you warm.               
	Where to go        
	It will be a night to remember at the social clubs, partnered by The Telegraph. [For details, check Good Morning Calcutta]                          
	What to sip        
	Mixologist Irfan serves it up for New Years Eve...        
	Begin the night with a Sangria (if its available)  basic red wine mixed with a few juices and it warms you.        
	Red wine is set to be a hit, as is the Mojito.        
	A good idea is to stick to whatever drink you like and not mix the drinks. Dilute the drink as much as you can with juices and aerated drinks, since food often goes for a toss and one tends to drink more.        
	Kebabs and finger food will be the pop picks on the last night, to go with the free flow.        
	How not to dance        
	Choreographer Chandan Verma suggests...        
	 The Pappu cant dance sala steps. We loved the finger-wagging and the head-shake, but Pappus run on the floor has ended. So, dont end up looking stupid.        
	 Excessive rap movements are, er, excessive.        
	 Hip hop is not meant for the 31st Nite dance floor.        
	 Exaggerated moves on the cramped floor can end up hurting someone (including you). So, take it easy.        
	 Holding your partner too close is a no-no (unless he/she wants it too).              
	Midnight moment        
	Be sure to make it count. Be right there with your partner/loved ones when the clock strikes 12. After that, start calling/texting/going crazy.         
	Want to make it filmi? Just say it like Harry did to Sally at the stroke of midnight in When Harry Met Sally.              
	Dial D for a drive home        
	Blenders Pride with t2 makes it easy for tipplers to get home. A helpline and taxi booking on first-come-first-served basis (033-44222222) is on for 31st night. And yes, its free. Cheers!

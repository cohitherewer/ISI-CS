                      History of humiliation                    Amba, the eldest daughter of the king of Kashi in the Mahabharata, along with her sisters, were forcefully taken away from their swayamvara by Bhishma, to be married to Vichitravirya, the king of Hastinapura. However, Vichitravirya married only her sisters and rejected Amba since she had already given her heart to someone else. However, when Amba went to meet her lover, he spurned her out of shame and also to avoid the wrath of the mighty Bhishma at the swayamvara. Amba then returned to Bhishma and demanded that he marry her, but was yet again refused as he had already taken a vow of celibacy. Thus, for no fault of hers, Amba was shunned by everyone and constrained to stay unmarried all her life. She swore to take revenge against Bhishma. Born as Shikhandini (hermaphrodite) in her next life, she came face-to-face with Bhisma in the battle of Kurukshetra. Bhishma, on identifying Amba in Shikhandi, refused to take up arms against her and was eventually killed by Arjuna in that encounter. Amba finally got justice for being dishonoured in her past life. Bohurupees Birja Shulka reviews and re-examines this story of manipulation and exploitation of woman by man in the light of modern times. It shows how time and again a womans identity and dignity have been trampled upon by men in a male-dominated society. The play tries to seek from the epical tale an answer that will relieve society from the harmful consequences of inequality between the sexes. Direction: Tulika Das.                    Event: Play in Bengali, Birja Sulka, produced by Bohurupee When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Madhusudan Mancha

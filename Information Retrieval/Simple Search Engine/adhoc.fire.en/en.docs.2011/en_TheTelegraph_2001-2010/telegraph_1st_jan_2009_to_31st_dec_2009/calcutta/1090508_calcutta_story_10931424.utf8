  - EC appeals against judge order to return SUV to Canning trader          OUR BUREAU                          Sachin Halders new SUV on poll duty on Thursday. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                        
	The Election Commission has become so enamoured of Sachin Halders new Tata Safari that it is even willing to challenge the court order to keep the forcibly requisitioned car.        
	After playing hard-to-get with Halder throughout Thursday, the district election officer of South 24-Parganas formally contested Mondays order by the single-judge bench of Justice Sanjib Banerjee to return the car to its owner in a bid to keep the mint-green SUV till the end of the poll process.        
	We have no intention of disobeying the court order. But in our view the order passed by Justice Banerjee was incorrect. Once the electoral process has begun, the high court has no jurisdiction in a case involving the Election Commission, Subrata Mukhopadhyay, the standing counsel for the state government, said after moving a division bench against the order.        
	But why deny 51-year-old Halder and his ailing wife the use of a car they own till the appeal comes up for hearing? There is no question of handing over the car to its owner now. An election observer is using it, Mukhopadhyay said.        
	The car covered 260km on Thursday, driver Munna Shaikh said.        
	Sources said several other officials have travelled in the comfort of the SUV, fitted with twin air-conditioners and a TV, since it was forcibly requisitioned on April 23.        
	Halder, a resident of Canning, had asked for exemption on the ground that the vehicle was meant for his wife Gayatri, who has a chronic skin ailment and travels 54km once every week to see a dermatologist.                    
	The slightest exposure to the sun causes blotches on her skin, he said.                  
	Sub-divisional officer (SDO) Md. Shahid would have none of it, forcing Halder to move the high court. When Justice Banerjee ruled in his favour last Monday, the rice trader became a hero for taking on and beating the bully-boy Election Commission.        
	But getting the car back from the sub-divisional office, Canning, has proved to be infinitely more difficult.         
	Halders counsel, Dipankar Basu, said: In the morning my client called the sub-divisional police officer to enquire when he would get back the car. The officer assured him that the car would be returned by noon. Around 2pm, my client contacted the SDO, who told him that he had sent the car for minor repairs and would return it by the end of the day.        
	Halder was taken in by the SDOs assurance and decided against moving a contempt petition in the high court. By the time it dawned on him that the officer was only buying time, it was too late.We hope the division bench stands by us after coming to know the sequence of events, Basu said.        
	The appeal is likely to be listed for hearing by a division bench headed by Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar on Friday.

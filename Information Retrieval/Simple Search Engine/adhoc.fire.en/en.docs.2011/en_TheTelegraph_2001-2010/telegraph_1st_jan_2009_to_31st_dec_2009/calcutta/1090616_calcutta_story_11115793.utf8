          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Maoists in Lalgarh had invited Jiten Mondal, the leader of the group of five alleged gunrunners arrested near Howrah station on Sunday, to stay with them, said CID on Monday.         
	We are in the preliminary stage of investigation but it appears that the Maoists wanted to use the groups expertise to set up an arms manufacturing unit in Lalgarh, said S.N. Gupta, the deputy inspector-general (CID operations).        
	The accused were produced in the chief judicial magistrates court in Howrah on Monday, where 51-year-old Jiten and his son Amit, residents of Nayagram in Murshidabad, were remanded in police custody for two days. The other three were remanded in judicial custody for 14 days.        
	Jiten was earlier arrested in Nadia for arms smuggling.

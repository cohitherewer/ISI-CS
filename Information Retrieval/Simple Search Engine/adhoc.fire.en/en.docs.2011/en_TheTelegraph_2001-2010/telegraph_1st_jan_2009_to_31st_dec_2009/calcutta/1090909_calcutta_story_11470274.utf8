	A combat missile on board the UAE air force aircraft detained in Calcutta late on Sunday could be delaying its departure to China.        
	External affairs minister S.M. Krishna said details made available by UAE officials in Delhi and Abu Dhabi mentioned a combat missile among other arms and ammunition, but added that the decks were being cleared for the release of the craft grounded by a technical error.        
	The matter will be resolved in the spirit of the close and friendly ties between India and the UAE, and we will facilitate early release of the aircraft, said Krishna.        
	State home secretary Ardhendu Sen said at Writers that the plane had not been allowed to leave under the Indian Customs Act. The state government has no role to play in its release, he stressed.        
	The nine-member crew of the C-130 Hercules transport aircraft remained behind closed doors at a star hotel on Tuesday. No one must know our names or that we are here, they told the hotel while checking in late on Monday. Metro spoke to one.  
	The case against further detention, sources said, had been weakened by the UAE authorities expressing ldquo;regret rdquo; over the ldquo;omission rdquo; in mentioning the arms on board the aircraft and have described it as a ldquo;technical error rdquo;.  
	The crew members in Calcutta also told investigators that they were victims of a ldquo;technical error rdquo; on the part of a junior clerk at the UAE embassy, who missed mentioning that the aircraft was carrying arms and ammunition. ldquo;They said it was a clerical error for which they were being harassed, rdquo; said a source.  
	Minister Krishna said on Tuesday that the UAE embassy had sought clearance to land its air force flight at Calcutta airport en route to China on Sunday. The captain of the flight, Ibrahim Alshamsei, then filed a declaration with the customs that the ldquo;flight was carrying arms/ammunition/explosives rdquo;.   
	 ldquo;Since at the time of initial application, no mention of the arms and ammunition was made, the authorities at Calcutta airport detained the aircraft for investigation, rdquo; the minister said.  
	The aircraft remains near hangar number 14 of Calcutta airport.

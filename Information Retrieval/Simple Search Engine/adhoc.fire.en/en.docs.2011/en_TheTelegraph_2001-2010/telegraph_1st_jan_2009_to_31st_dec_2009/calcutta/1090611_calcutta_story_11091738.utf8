The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hearing after petitioner death
                                                                                                               Hearing after petitioner death
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Wednesday spent around two hours hearing a petition filed by a woman no longer alive.        
	Justice Maharaja Sinha heard Gouri Chatterjees petition as her lawyer failed to mention that she had died in August 2008 and her son and daughter had filed a plea seeking consent to fight their mothers case.        
	The heirs plea came up for hearing before Justice Girish Gupta minutes after proceedings ended in Justice Sinhas court.        
	When Chatterjees lawyer informed Justice Gupta that Justice Sinha had heard the case, lawyers representing the respondents pointed out that the original petition could not be taken up till the heirs plea was disposed of.        
	The petition of a dead person cannot be heard by any court, submitted Aloke Ghosh, the lawyer of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), one of the respondents.        
	Justice Gupta then adjourned the proceedings till June 17. The lawyer of one of the respondents will have to inform Justice Sinha about the heirs plea on June 15, when the original petition will come up for hearing.        
	Chatterjee lived in one half of a building on Sarat Banerjee Road, in south Calcutta, the other half of which was sold to a developer.        
	The woman moved court alleging that the civic body had sanctioned an expansion plan for the building submitted by the developer, in which a common passage was shown as part of the developers property.

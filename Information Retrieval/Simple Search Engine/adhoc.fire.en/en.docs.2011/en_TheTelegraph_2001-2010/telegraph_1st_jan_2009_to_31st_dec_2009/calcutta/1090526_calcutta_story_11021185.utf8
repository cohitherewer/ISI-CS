                      Triumph of virtue                    It is easier to acquire wealth by dishonest means rather than achieve it through hard work. And if you manage to avoid getting caught for stealing, then it can be considered your greatest quality. It is with this belief that Hudo, in the play, Mahavidya Primary, started off on his ambitious project of finding and training children to become thieves. To be staged as part of Nehru Childrens Museums ongoing five-day drama festival for children, its story is built around the eternal conflict between good and evil. Hudo takes the help of local police officer Gargari daroga to carry on the nefarious activities in his school. Local athlete Anima Biswas and Medha, a teacher, stand for the forces of good. These two women raise a voice of protest. They also educate and humanise the children, showing them how they can reform their lives and grow up to be good, honest citizens. Ultimately, it celebrates the power of love and understanding that defeats the wicked influences of the Hudos of our society. Direction: Ramaprasad Banik. Also to be performed this evening is Jujur Jama, produced by Taki Natyam (at 7.30 pm).

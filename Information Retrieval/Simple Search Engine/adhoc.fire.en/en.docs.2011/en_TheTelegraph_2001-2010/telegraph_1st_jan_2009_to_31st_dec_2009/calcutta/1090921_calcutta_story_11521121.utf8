	A 64-year-old ailing man lay unattended on the pavement of Bidhan Sarani for hours on Sunday morning. He was taken to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital in the afternoon after Metro alerted police.        
	Samiran Das, a former ex-employee of a private firm, said he was feeling much better in the evening. His blood pressure had stabilised too.        
	Das was found lying on the pavement resting his head on a black bag near Thanthania Kalibari. Bystanders crowded around him but none took him to the hospital, barely 100 metres away, or contacted police.        
	I was driven out of my home on Rajnarayan Biswas Lane in 2006 by my brothers-in-law and have been wandering the streets since then. This morning I found I was unable to move, said Das, a former student of maths honours at Scottish Church College.        
	Officers of three police stations Girish Park, Amherst Street and Jorasanko  took Das to the hospital after Metro informed the Lalbazar Control Room about him.        
	Doctors said Dass blood pressure was very low. He is suffering from weakness and malnutrition but should get better with good food and care, said a doctor.         
	When contacted, Dass brother-in-law Prabir Das said Das had got Rs 5 lakh when his mothers house was sold.         
	He has nowhere to go once he is discharged from hospital, said an officer of Girish Park police station.

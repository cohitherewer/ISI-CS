                      A personal symbolism                    An immensely talented artist whose dreamy, Dionysian works are both sensual and mysterious, Katayun Saklat compellingly captures the human element and creates worlds that, despite their mystery, are instantly recognisable. Her elaborate dreamscapes are adventures into the territory of desire, transgressing into the realm of all that is taboo or exists within the sub-conscious. An Inner Journey, the ongoing show of her works, finds the artist using her distinctive metaphorical language and unorthodox relationship with traditional aesthetics, to provide a wide variety of artistic and intellectual pleasures. The works, ranging from her typically characteristic demonaic doll to the more recent portraits of relatives, have an internal logic of their own. The symbols embedded in them illustrate ideas contrary to traditional perception. They represent profoundly personal interpretations of complex philosophical and magical ideas, whose meanings have always been permeable and shifting, encouraging multiple levels of interpretation. Nevertheless, there is a hint of what these ideas might be, documenting Saklats ties to purism and surrealism, to personal relations, music and feminism, as well as to the ethnographic study of religion and myth.                    Event: An exhibition of paintings by Katayun Saklat When: Till March 4; 11 am - 7 pm Where: Gallery K2, Supra Court, 35 Lansdowne Terrace

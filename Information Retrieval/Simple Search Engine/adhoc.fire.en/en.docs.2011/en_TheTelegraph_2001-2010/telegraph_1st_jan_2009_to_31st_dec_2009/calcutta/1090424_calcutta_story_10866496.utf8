The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 20-day assault on 30 acres
                                                                                                               20-day assault on 30 acres
  - Sir, national library is a place for books not bamboos          OUR BUREAU                  
	National Librarys dogged resistance to the Election Commission taking over the premises for 20 days brought the chief electoral officer to its door on Thursday afternoon.        
	We do not have a National Library fixation; we are just hampered by the lack of suitable alternatives. There are no halls as big and facilities as convenient, Debashis Sen said after his meeting with director K.K. Banerjee.        
	The chief electoral officer assured Banerjee of a rethink on setting up polling booths and counting centres on the 30-acre campus in return for his support during the 20 days that the campus would be used for other election activities.        
	We enjoy the support of the library authorities in every election. We hope it will be the same this time, too, he said.        
	For the staff and regulars at the library, nothing short of a complete withdrawal would do. We have been assured of minimal disruption but we are not convinced yet, director Banerjee said.        
	So, will the National Library family stand at the gates when the election caravan rolls in as planned on April 28?        
	Under the Representation of Peoples Act, the commission can take over the premises for poll-related work. We are fighting but there is little we can do to stop them, the library director said.        
	The Election Commission intends setting up distribution centres on the library premises, though Sen said a decision was yet to be taken.        
	A sub-committee comprising the chief librarian, the assistant returning officer and a police representative will analyse the situation on Friday to arrive at a conclusion, he announced.        
	The poll panel had last taken over the library during Assembly elections in 2006 and turned it into a distribution centre for electronic voting machines.        
	Rows of buses and cars were parked bumper to bumper in front of the library and pandals set up on the lawns. Food was cooked in the open for the personnel who had camped on the premises. Loudspeakers blared throughout, disturbing the readers.        
	It was a picnic that disrupted the normal functioning of the library and we do not want a repeat this year, said a senior employee.        
	When the commission is fighting to protect public and private walls from defacement, why is it determined to violate the sanctity of the countrys premier library? demanded another.        
	The chief electoral officer argued that the poll panel had been setting up distribution centres on the library premises for the past three decades and that it had almost become a tradition.        
	Poet and academic Sankha Ghosh, one of the high-profile regulars at the library, said he had expected the Election Commission to change its mind after so much opposition. It is best not to requisition a place which readers need every moment, he said.        
	The suggestions of Sukanta Chaudhuri seem to have fallen on deaf ears with the Election Commission determined to play predator rather than protector when it comes to using the library for poll work.        
	The eminent professor of English had in Metro suggested two Belvedere Road addresses  the Eastern Railway officers club and Rambrahma Sanyal Smriti Sadan  as alternatives to National Library.

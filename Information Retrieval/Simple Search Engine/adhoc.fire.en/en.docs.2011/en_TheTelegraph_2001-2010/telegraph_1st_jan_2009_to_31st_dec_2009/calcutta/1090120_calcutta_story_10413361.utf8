                The SUCI has called a 12-hour bandh from 6am on Thursday demanding reduction in the electricity charge, bus fares and other issues. The spokesperson for the party said emergency as well as essential services would be exempted from the bandh. Book Fair cars, too, would be spared but not the IT sector vehicles. Bandhs called by SUCI are usually supported by the Trinamul Congress and disrupt life in pockets of south Calcutta and South 24-Parganas. The Trinamul is not supporting Thursdays bandh.    Over 10,000 private car drivers in the city will strike work on Wednesday, demanding appointment letters, fixed working hours, life insurance, pension, a minimum wage of Rs 5,000 and the status of workmen. They will take out a rally in the afternoon from Mohammad Ali Park to the Gandhi statue on the Maidan and submit a memorandum to state labour minister Mrinal Banerjee at Writers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cyclone Aila hits theme puja pandals
                                                                                                               Cyclone Aila hits theme puja pandals

	Trust puja organisers to find creativity in disaster and to try to uplift the disaster-hit through creativity. Aila, the cyclone that rocked Bengal, has now entered the Durga puja lexicon.         
	Resurrecting life from the ravages is Kishore Bahini Athletic Club off Motilal Nehru Road. We are using whatever is left post-Aila to construct a thing of beauty and welcome the Mother with renewed hope, said Babu Ray, an organiser.         
	Uprooted trees have been collected. Broken huts line the wall of the puja compound while at a side sandbags stand piled with damaged boats on it. Beside it will be a temple of Banbibi, the forest goddess. Durga will carry Ganesh and Kartik in her arms like a mother sheltering children from trouble. Mahishasura too will seek her protection.         
	 The club will be distributing saplings to replenish the citys green cover and donate to the Aila cause.         
	Other pujas are focusing on the devastation. Bishnupur Jagriti Sangha in Rajarhat-Battala, near Vedic Village, has cut a foot-deep trench. This is where a dam will give way. We had gone to Satjelia in the Sunderbans with relief materials when the idea came to us, says treasurer Manas Ghosh. Paddy has been sown in the field. The crop will be submerged in water just as we saw there. The pandal will be a damaged village hut.        
	A relief distribution trip was also the catalyst for Kestopur Prafulla Kanan Sarbojanin puja, off VIP Road. The organisers have engaged men from Sandeshkhalis Kanmari village whose belongings have been washed away by Aila to execute their theme.         
	Thirty of us are here, said Tinu and Sudam Sardar. Their faces brighten up when they talk of their families joining them soon.         
	We are engaging labour from the Aila-hit areas so that our puja provides some rehabilitation. We have invited their family members and will take them pandal-hopping, said an organiser.        
	The tribals are building the huts their way, with clay pasted on bamboo mats. Deities like Manasa and Banbibi will add a local touch. The pond behind the pandal will house submerged huts and trees, a broken dam, and cattle waiting on the banks. A donation counter will be set up to add to the funds we have set aside for them, added the organiser.        
	If this puja is bringing the Aila-hit to the puja, a group of organisations is taking Puja to the Aila-hit. Asthabhojon, a catering service in Salt Lake, and an entrepreneurship development institute called Senate forged such links during their post-Aila Sunderban trip that they are returning to organise Durga puja there.         
	These people do not have the means to put together a puja this year. But they cannot be deprived, says Urmi Pal Chowdhury, an organiser.         
	The effort started on a low key. Now some Sector V firms are logging in as is a cable service operator. Laxbagan village on Satjelia island with 286 families has been chosen as the venue. Local artisans are making the idol and pandal.         
	The organisers will take turns to stay over and facilitate the puja contests that have been planned  catching geese from the pond, dhunuchi dance, conch-blowing.... We want them to feel they have earned what they get from us. The only gifts will be blankets for the aged, books for students and new dresses for children. One day, a feast will be arranged for the entire village.

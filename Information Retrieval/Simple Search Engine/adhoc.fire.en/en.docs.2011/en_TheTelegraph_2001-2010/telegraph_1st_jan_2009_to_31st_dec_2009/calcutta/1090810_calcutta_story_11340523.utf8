	Tourists can look forward to a bigger and better Puja this year.        
	The West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation has introduced a Pandal Hopping Tour as part of The Telegraph-supported Sharadotsav 2009, which starts on September 25.         
	Hundreds of Durga puja pandals come up across the the city, some with exquisite artwork, but there had been no direct access to them for tourists till last year.        
	Tourists enrolling with the pandal-hopping tour wont have to stand in long queues to enter the pandals. They will have direct access to the puja premises, T.V.N. Rao, the managing director of the state tourism corporation, said on Sunday.        
	The Pandal Hopping Tour has been split according to zones. The north Calcutta (Puratani) tour will cover pujas like Kumartuli, Telengabagan and College Square while the south Calcutta (Dakshini-I and II) trip will touch Suruchi Sangha, Badamtala Asharsangha and Mudiali. Dum Dum Park Yubak Brinda and Sribhumi will be part of the east Calcutta package. The tours will cost Rs 800 and Rs 550 per person in AC and non-AC buses, respectively.        
	A festive bonus is being offered to senior citizens and orphaned children on September 25. We will allocate one bus each for senior citizens from old-age homes and children from orphanages for a free Pandal Hopping Tour, the minister said.        
	Another major draw of Sharadotsav 2009 will be Puja On River Ganges. We will set up a pontoon on the river with an idol. Various cultural activities and fireworks will be organised on the pontoon.... If the response is good, the events will be planned on a bigger scale next year, tourism minister Manab Mukherjee said. Revellers can watch the cultural shows and fireworks sitting aboard boats which will float around the 9mX30m pontoon.        
	The state tourism department is also offering Traditional Durga Puja Tours for the third consecutive year. Those coming from outside the city can choose from eight to 10 packages a day. Ten airconditioned and four non air-conditioned buses have been allotted for each package.        
	Last year, the response to the packages was overwhelming. Our buses had 80 per cent occupancy. This year we have increased the number of trips from 84 to 258 and seats from 2,688 to 8,815, said Rao.

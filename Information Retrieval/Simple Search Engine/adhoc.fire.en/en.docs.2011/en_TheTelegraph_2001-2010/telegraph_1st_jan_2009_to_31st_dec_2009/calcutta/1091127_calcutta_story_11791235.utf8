          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Four youths were arrested at Dum Dum Park, near VIP Road, early on Thursday and arms and contraband seized from them.         
	Police said Priyankar Modak, Biswajit Das, Partha Modak and Amit Dey were travelling in a white car and had possibly gathered in the area to commit a dacoity.         
	An officer said Priyankar and Biswajit were accomplices of haatkata Dilip, who is serving life term for twin murders in 2004.        
	Biswajit was arrested with Dilip but was released later. Priyankar was absconding for the past five years. Apart from the 2004 murders, there are two more murder cases against Priyankar, said the officer.        
	We had information about the gang. Four country-made pipe guns, seven rounds of bullets and 21kg ganja were found on them, said Debabrata Das, the additional superintendent of police, Bidhannagar. The four were remanded in judicial custody for 14 days.         
	Cops said the gang was involved in extortion, snatching, throwing crude bombs and other crimes in the Lake Town and Dakshindari areas. Priyankar had named Dilips brother Sanjit Banerjee as their leader, said an officer. Sanjit was detained later in the day.

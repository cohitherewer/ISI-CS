The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Father lost arm but saved son 
                                                                                                               Father lost arm but saved son 
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	The condition of the three passengers who lost their right arms in Tuesdays bus mishap on Dufferin Road remained critical the day after.        
	Ashok Ghosh, the superintendent of SSKM Hospital where Barun and Jayashree Chakraborty had their arms amputated, said on Wednesday evening that the couple were stable but were still not out of danger.        
	The other victim, Assam resident Ashish Paul, underwent a surgery for amputation at AMRI Hospitals, Dhakuria. He is stable but cannot be pronounced entirely out of danger, said medical superintendent Swapan Ghosh.        
	The three passengers were sitting in a Howrah-Behala minibus, their elbows sticking out, when a racing bus from the opposite direction grazed their side of the bus.        
	Transport minister Ranjit Kundu visited the Chakrabortys on Wednesday and announced that the government would bear the cost of their treatment, as well as Pauls.         
	Barun, a librarian at the Jadavpur Regional College of Printing, said the driver of the racing bus was at fault. My six-year-old son was sitting on my lap. Thank god I could push him away just in time, recalled the 51-year-old, lying on his hospital bed.        
	Barun appeared stoic while talking to Metro but broke down on seeing a friend who had come to meet him.        
	Baruns eldest brother Swapan, who has retired as the additional director of employment in the state labour department, said six-year-old Subhajit was yet to realise the extent of the tragedy. He is playing and running around as usual. But he had suffered a head injury so well take him for a check-up on Thursday, said Swapan.        
	The Chakrabortys are pooling in all their resources to help Barun and family tide over the crisis. All our brothers and their families lived together in Garia till a few months ago when Barun, Jayashree and their son moved to a flat as our house is being renovated. They will stay with us after they are released from hospital. We will see to it that Subhajit does not suffer because of his parents misfortune, said Swapan.        
	Barun and Jayashree were shifted to Woodburn Ward, usually reserved for VIP patients, following a plea from minister Kundu who received a complaint from relatives about the unhygienic condition of the New Emergency Ward where the couple had been admitted.        
	The family members also alleged harassment and negligence. The two were given 17 units of blood, which we could arrange after making several trips to the blood bank. This also resulted in delay in transfusion. Since no attendants were around, it was left to us to wheel Jayashree to the OT, said Tapan, the second of the three Chakraborty brothers.        
	Superintendent Ghosh denied any delay in transfusion.

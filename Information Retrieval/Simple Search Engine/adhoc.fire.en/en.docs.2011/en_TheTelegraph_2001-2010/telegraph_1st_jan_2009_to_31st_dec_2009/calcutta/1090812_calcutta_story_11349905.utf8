          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two patients at the Infectious Diseases Hospital tested positive for swine flu on Tuesday while a 13-year-old girl was admitted to the isolation ward with symptoms of the disease.         
	Twelve persons have so far tested positive for swine flu in the Beleghata hospital.         
	An official in the state health department said the latest victims  Arpan Chowdhury and R. Ramakrishnan, both in their 20s  had recently travelled abroad. Chowdhury, a Salt Lake resident, is a neighbour of Rishab Bopana, who is being treated for swine flu at the Beleghata hospital.         
	Sushmita Chakraborty, a neighbour of six-year-old Pranjali Mondal, who had recently contracted swine flu, was admitted to the hospital on Tuesday with fever and cold.        
	Kedarnath Babulal Rajgaria High School in Howrah, where Pranjali studies, has been closed for a week as a precautionary measure.         
	A team from the state health department will visit the school on Wednesday to fumigate the classrooms, said principal Kasturi Roy.         
	The Union minister of state for health, Dinesh Trivedi, inspected the Beleghata hospital, the health unit at the airport and the newly opened swine flu clinics at RG Kar and NRS hospitals.         
	The ministry, Trivedi said, would ask private healthcare units to set up isolation wards for treating swine flu patients.         
	We need more isolation wards as the disease may spread further. We will hold talks with private healthcare wards and ask them to set up more isolation units and testing centres for swine flu, Trivedi said.         
	The minister stressed the need to upgrade the infrastructure at the airport health unit.

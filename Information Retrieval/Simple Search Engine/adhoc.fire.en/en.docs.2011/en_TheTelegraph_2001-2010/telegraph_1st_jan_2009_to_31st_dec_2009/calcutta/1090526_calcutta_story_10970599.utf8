  - MARTINIANS MEET ON COURT                              The present basketball team of La Martiniere for Girls takes on the ex-students. Picture by Anindya Shankar Ray                                  
	For the members of the Association of La Martiniere Alumni, it was a trip down memory lane at a basketball match where old-timers fought it out with current students on May 9. The match kicked off the 175th anniversary celebrations of the school.         
	The association works as a non-profit organisation whose funds go into the betterment of the school.         
	The sweltering heat of the afternoon did not seem to bother the players, who were ready to give their best.         
	The visits back to school are like returning to our roots, said ex-student Tejash Doshi, joint managing director of Indrapuri Studios.        
	The present La Martiniere team, which will be competing with La Martiniere, Lucknow, later this month, was in full form, keeping the ball on their hold of the court most of the time. But the past students, most of whom had taken leave from work to attend the meet, put up a tough game, too.         
	What matters is students from diverse years coming together for a game, said Hilda Peacock, the principal.         
	The present students won, with 64 baskets against 42 by the old-timers. Most of the past students are out of touch with the game, but they made a good effort, smiled coach K. Manral.         
	Vaishali Jain, an alumni of the batch of 1989, said: Returning to the school and playing again brought back many fond memories.         
	The present students were no less thrilled, It was a great opportunity to play with such great players. I hope we organise more such meets, said Garishma Keyal, a student of Class XII.

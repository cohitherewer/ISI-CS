The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Leaders suspended over mall fracas
                                                                                                               Leaders suspended over mall fracas
          A STAFF REPORTER                           Billboards torn during Sundays incident                                  
	The North 24-Parganas CPM leadership on Wednesday suspended Salt Lake local committee member Niloy Ghosh and Citu activist Suman Ghoshal for the billboard battle outside City Centre on Sunday afternoon.         
	The district committee investigated the case and found that both Niloy and Suman had used the partys name for personal gains. Their activities on Sunday were not in accordance with our party guidelines, said CPM MP Amitava Nandy, who looks after the partys affairs in Salt Lake.         
	The Citu district leadership cautioned Pramod Jha, the secretary of the taxi union in Salt Lake. On Tuesday, Ghosh, Ghoshal and Jha were served showcause notices.        
	According to a CPM leader in Salt Lake, the billboard battle has highlighted the need to review the way the party is being run in the township. Two leaders were punished so quickly since troubles within the party were exposed right before the elections, he added.        
	The trouble started because Citu supporters wanted money from people who had come to put up hoardings near City Centre. Members of Outdoor Advertising Association informed the municipality chairman that such demands had become commonplace in Salt Lake. So the party was forced to take tough steps, said a local CPM leader.         
	Ghosh, who runs a billboard business, is believed to be close to some senior CPM leaders in the area.

              By Sunil GuptaBy Anna Fox        Face studies and beyond                    The ongoing photography exhibition, Face Up, explores the relationship that Anna Fox and Sunil Gupta have both developed to the photograph as portrait. The term, Face Up, suggests a facing up to truths or a sense of landing upright in the right place. In much of their work, Gupta and Fox use a very controlled approach to photographing their subjects, directing them quite specifically in order to explore and extend their radical ideas, revealing aspects of life that normally remain concealed. Both photographers work from the starting point of the personal and the private; their work questions past representations and raises new questions and dilemmas concerned with race, gender and identity.                    Event: An exhibition of photographs by Anna Fox and Sunil Gupta When: Till October 22; 2 pm - 8 pm Where: Seagull Arts amp; Media Resource Centre, 36C S.P. Mukherjee Road

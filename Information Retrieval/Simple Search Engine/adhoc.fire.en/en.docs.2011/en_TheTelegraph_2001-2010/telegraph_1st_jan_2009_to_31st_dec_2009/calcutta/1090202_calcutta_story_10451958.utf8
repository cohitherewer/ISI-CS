The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mishap car agony for victims family
                                                                                                               Mishap car agony for victims family
  - Father cannot sell vehicle in which son was impaled by metal cable jutting out of road          JULIUS GOMES                          The car in which Amit Dalmia met his end. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha                                        
	A steel strip jutting out of tram tracks pierced a taxis undercarriage on January 24 reminding the city of Amit Dalmias death in a similar mishap in 2003. For his family members, the car he was driving that day has served as a constant reminder.         
	The green Maruti Zen stands on the premises of the Dalmias Russell Street office. It cannot be sold because the criminal case started against a telecom company on the basis of the FIR filed by Amits father Santosh drags on in the high court.         
	The company was laying the two-inch-wide, 11-foot-long steel cable that punctured the undercarriage of the Zen on Camac Street and passed through the drivers seat pinning 26-year-old to it and created a hole in the rear seat. As the car continued to move forward, the snake-like cable flipped back and sliced through Amits body before withdrawing through the hole it had created on the vehicles floor.         
	I have to pass that car every day on my way to work and remember how my son was killed. I had wanted to sell it so that I would never have to look at it again but was not allowed to since the case hasnt been disposed of, said 58-year-old Santosh.         
	Many metal cables still protrude from Calcutta roads. I reported several of them to police, after which they were severed, said Amits younger brother Ashish.         
	I barely got to know my brother. We were together just for a year in St Pauls School, Darjeeling. I was looking forward to spending time with him after he returned to Calcutta from the UK but the accident snatched him away.         
	Ashish had joined St Pauls in Class VI when Amit was in Class XII. By the time Ashish finished his schooling and returned home, Amit had left for the UK. The fatal mishap occurred after Amit returned with an MBA from Leeds University, a week before Ashishs Part I examinations were to start.         
	We were numb from shock for a long time and nothing seemed to register. Six years have passed but I still find it amazing that no one cares about metal cables and tram tracks protruding from roads, said Ashish.         
	After the fatal accident, the civic body and the police had started a probe and promised to formulate a strategy to get rid of cables and tram tracks jutting out of roads, said Amits elder brother Vishal. The January 24 mishap shows that little has been done.

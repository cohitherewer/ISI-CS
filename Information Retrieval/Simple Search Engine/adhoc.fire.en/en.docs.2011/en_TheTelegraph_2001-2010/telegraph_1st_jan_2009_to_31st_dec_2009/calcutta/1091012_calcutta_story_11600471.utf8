The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Report ready on Metro snag
                                                                                                               Report ready on Metro snag
  - Shortage of rakes          A STAFF REPORTER                          Commuters rush for a Metro Railway train after services were restored on Thursday                                        
	The four-member committee probing the Metro Railway snag on Thursday that disrupted services for three hours on the extended portion will submit its report on Monday.        
	The members of the panel  senior officials of the operations, civil and electrical engineering and signalling departments  on Saturday visited the spot near Birji (Shahid Khudiram) station where the current collector of a rake reportedly disturbed the alignment of the third rail, triggering a chain reaction.        
	The panel members also examined the rake, now kept at the Noapara maintenance shed.        
	The committee is scheduled to submit the report tomorrow. The experts are trying to determine whether the third rail or the rake caused the snag, said a Metro spokesperson on Sunday.        
	On Thursday, trains did not ply between Tollygunge (Mahanayak Uttam Kumar) and Garia Bazar (Kavi Nazrul) from 10.30am to 1.20pm and between Tollygunge and Dum Dum from 11am to 11.45am because of power supply problems.         
	A preliminary probe suggested that the problem started while a rake from Dum Dum was changing tracks at Birji for the return journey. If the alignment of the third rail changes, the rakes behind the one that causes the problem do not receive power. The current collector of the rack that apparently triggered the problem is believed to have grazed the third rail in the Tollygunge-Dum Dum section, causing further disruptions.         
	Metro officials said operations had been hampered by the absence of a rake. All but one of the 18 rakes were being used. With no extra rake for cushion, we have been forced to work extra to maintain operations, said an official.        
	Sources said a number of trains were delayed on Saturday because of shortage of rakes. We are planning to reintroduce the rake again on Monday, added the official.        
	A permanent solution is not in sight with the arrival of new rakes from Integral Coach Factory in Chennai, scheduled in October, having been delayed. The factory has postponed the delivery of the first train to next year, said a Metro Railway official.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The information technology (IT) sector in Bengal, which started in Calcutta and later forayed into Siliguri and Durgapur, is eyeing another destination in the state  Kharagpur.        
	IBM Daksh, the BPO arm of IBM, has expressed an interest in setting up a facility in Kharagpur, state IT minister Debesh Das said on Wednesday. IBM Daksh could not be reached for comment on the matter.        
	IBM Daksh wants to open shop in Kharagpur and has asked for 2 acres there. We will soon start the process of acquiring land in Kharagpur, Das said on Wednesday at the stone laying ceremony of an IT park behind Science City.        
	The proposed IT park, to be developed by Webel and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), will come up on a 2-acre plot at an investment of Rs 40 crore. It is expected to be completed within 15 months from the date of start of construction, which is yet to be decided.        
	We hope the locational advantage will ensure tenants for the IT park, Das said.         
	The proposed IT zone will employ 2,500 people directly and 10,000 indirectly once it becomes fully operational, state commerce and industry minister Nirupam Sen said on the occasion.        
	Webel and the CMC entered into an agreement last month to execute the project. Each will make an initial investment of Rs 5 crore.         
	The land will be provided by the CMC from the 5 acres it had received from Science City.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | The last British imperialist
                                                                                                               The last British imperialist
                              Lord Chris Patten autographs his books at the ICCR. A Telegraph picture                            
	Do you know what the India-New Zealand cricket score is? Unfortunately, the scribes who had come to meet Lord Chris Patten  the last British governor of Hong Kong, the current co-chairman of the International Crisis Group, the best foreign secretary that Britain never had, the architect of the Conservatives fourth consecutive win in the 1992 elections and the chancellor of Oxford University  were not cricket buffs.         
	So the cricket score temporarily eluded Patten, whose love for the willow matched only his passion for politics. But that didnt perturb him. He punched on his BlackBerry to get what he wanted. He got his BlackBerry out the second time to show the picture of his five grandsons in Halloween costumes.        
	The silver-haired, robust and jovial 64-year-old has seen enough not to despair over the current economic crises. Patten watched Obamas victory in Ohio on television along with Colin Powell, the former US secretary of state, who was visibly moved.         
	He recalled an anecdote. As a post-graduate student at Oxford University, I had a scholarship and was on a study tour to the United States. There were two of us who landed in Montgomery, Alabama, and went to the first diner we saw. We had hired a car, which strangely had the registration number of a state up north. When we went inside the diner, the manager asked us to leave, saying two civil rights workers had been shot the day before. Our Oxford accent, our Beatles haircut, our denims and the northern number plate of our hired car made us look like rights activists, said Patten.         
	I had seen how the world had moved from murdering civil rights activists to choosing the first Black American President. So I am rightly optimistic to believe that we will also manage to wriggle out of the mess that we find ourselves in, in the 21st century.         
	In the city for the first time, though he has visited India over 20 times (and he duly apologised to Calcutta for this cultural aberration), Patten was here to deliver a lecture organised by the British Council on What next? Surviving the 21st Century, which is also the title of his latest book. Of the several crises of this century  economy, terrorism, recession, climate change  Patten said that none could be solved without engaging China and India.         
	China, Patten thought, needed a systemic change in its authoritarian political structure, for unless that happens the country will not be able to accommodate its economy. Besides, its economy would have to shift focus from manufacturing to services, it would have to develop health services, deal with its water shortage, social inequality and maternal mortality figures.         
	Two to three years ago, there was a report in the Hong Kong communist press of an argument between modernisers and hardliners in Beijing. The latter thought the party could not go on giving up control over the economy. The modernisers contended that unless that happened, China would not grow, recounted its last imperialist governor.         
	He said that while India did not face an existential question like China, it still needed to deal with the rise of identity politics, which hates with a passion. My great grandparents were potato farmers who migrated from Ireland, I am a Catholic and a Conservative, the last colonial oppressor in British history. Am I a wicked Tory or a British imperialist with my four pints of Irish blood? My feeling is that my identity as a citizen is based not on my religion but on my values, said Patten.         
	He said India behaved with thoroughly commendable restraint in the wake of the Mumbai attacks. But a few days later, there were ghastly rocket attacks by Hamas and Israel flattened Gaza. America and the West said not a word.         
	Pattens prescription for recession: We either swim together or sink together. Despite the humiliation in Wall Street, America is the only superpower in the world. Yet the US today faces a huge economic problem because Americans havent dealt with their inability to comprehend the notion of reasonable sufficiency.         
	In 2007, a bright young man, he said, was trying to explain how a triple B loan could be morphed into a triple A bond. A stupid person like me never understood. But I think neither did he.         
	But all this was dwarfed by the bigger threat of climate change. Terrorists arent changing climate patterns, they arent melting Himalayan glaciers or causing acid rain. There has to be international cooperation on aggregate emissions and per capita emissions, technology transfer of ozone depleting substances.         
	Patten believes the world will rise to these challenges for unless it does, his grandchildren and their children will not have an earth to live in.                    ANASUYA BASU

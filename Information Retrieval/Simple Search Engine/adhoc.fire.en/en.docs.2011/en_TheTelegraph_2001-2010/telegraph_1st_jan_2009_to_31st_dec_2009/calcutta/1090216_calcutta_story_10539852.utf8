	A truck carrying coal collided with a taxi killing its driver and lone passenger on a dark and dangerous stretch of BT Road, near Sodepur, before sunrise on Sunday.        
	Police said the truck, travelling from Barrackpore to Sodepur, hit the taxi, moving in the opposite direction, from the right around 4.45am.        
	Though the road has dividers, about 500 metres of the Barrackpore-bound flank is closed for repairs, forcing vehicles from both sides to use the other flank. Moreover, street lights on the stretch do not work.        
	The condition of the road along the stretch is poor, according to residents.         
	The victims were identified as Umesh Mishra, 55, and driver Binod Das, 24. Mishra, an iron goods trader, was returning home after attending a wedding at Park Street.        
	The two were taken to Balaram Seva Mandir Hospital, where they were declared dead on arrival.        
	We are trying to find out whether the taxi was speeding or the truck driver lost control. But we dont have any witnesses. The truck has been seized but the driver fled, said an officer.         
	Members of the Trinamul Congress staged a roadblock on BT Road for around two hours on Sunday morning to protest the mishap. They demanded more traffic officers on BT Road and speeding up of road repairs. The blockade caused major traffic disruption in the area.         
	The repair work has been continuing for several months now. We dont know when it will be over. Mishaps are common on the stretch because of the absence of street lights, said a Trinamul leader from the area.

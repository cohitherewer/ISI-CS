	The UAE air force aircraft detained in Calcutta since Sunday night will be released on Thursday morning, a senior intelligence official in the city said on Wednesday.         
	The necessary clearance for the aircraft has arrived from the ministries of external affairs and defence, said the official.        
	The Centre said the plane could leave provided it obtained all local clearances.        
	The C-130 Hercules transport aircraft is scheduled to take-off with its nine-member crew at 9am on Thursday, the intelligence official added.         
	The aircraft was detained by customs officials after it landed at the city airport for refuelling on its way from Abu Dhabi to Hunyang in China.        
	Customs officials had found on board arms, ammunition and explosives in the aircraft that the crew had not declared.         
	Till Wednesday evening, security and customs officials were busy preparing a fresh clearance certificate for the aircraft.         
	The original clearance certificate of the plane had been cancelled by the Indian Air Force after the arms were detected.         
	The crew members are in a city hotel. They have been informed about the clearance, the official said. An airport source said the immigration clearance of the crew members would be completed once they arrived at the airport on Thursday morning.         
	The crew members continued to keep a low profile on Wednesday. They did not step out of their rooms for breakfast. The Indian government will bear the expenses for their stay.        
	When Metro contacted one of the crew members in his hotel room at 10.30am on Wednesday, he refused to speak.

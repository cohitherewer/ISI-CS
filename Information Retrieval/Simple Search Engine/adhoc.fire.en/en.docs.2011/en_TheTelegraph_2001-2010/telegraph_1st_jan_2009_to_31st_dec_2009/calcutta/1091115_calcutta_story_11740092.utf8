	The ministry of culture is looking at developing small performance areas to revive interest in theatre in Calcutta.         
	Taking its cue from the black box theatre experiment that started in the West in the 1960s, where small empty spaces were painted black and used for staging experimental theatre in an informal setting, the Centre wants to develop small spaces with a capacity of not more than 50 or 60 people.         
	Forget the commercial aspect, it must be very upsetting for actors when after months of rehearsals they open a new play to find only the first three rows of an auditorium occupied. The audience for theatre is becoming smaller every day. Black box theatre has been successful in the West, said Jawhar Sircar, the culture secretary.         
	The ministry proposed to help develop small spaces like rehearsal rooms as studio theatres. The idea was greeted enthusiastically by the citys theatre practitioners, he added.         
	Bibhas Chakraborty, who has for long pressed for smaller performances areas, said: Now any registered cultural organisation with land or building ready to use as theatre labs or black boxes can apply. The one-time grant amount of around Rs 25 lakh is hardly sufficient, but it is a good start.        
	Intimate theatre in offbeat spaces has been part of local theatre since the 1970s with Badal Sircar breaking out of the proscenium to explore indoor and outdoor venues. Now theatre group Shatabdi performs at the Loreto Day School, Sealdah, and the Nandan Complex. Prabir Guhas Alternative Living Theatre has its Akhra in Madhyamgram while Total Theatre, Rangalok and various other groups have used various open spaces, including the Kabiraj naachghar in Kumartulli.         
	Whose turn is it anyway?         
	When participants are selected by turns and not on merit, one mustnt get ones hopes too high for a theatre festival in town.         
	The state Natyamela begins on November 23 with 37 full-length, 43 one-act, 19 street and seven intimate plays. But new plays may fail to make the cut simply on the ground that the theatre group had been selected last year.        
	This year will see an exhibition on Habib Tanvir and staging of Charandas Chor at Madhusudan Mancha on November 30. The highlight is Ashibagee Eshei adapted from Ibsens When We Dead Awaken by Ratan Thiyams Chorus Repertory Theatre of Imphal.         
	The play adapted to the Manipuri milieu won acclaim at its premiere at the NSD Ibsen Festival in Delhi last year.               
	Correction: The main building of National Library was not used as a residence by Lord Dalhousie as mentioned in The house of Dalhousie, November 8. Dalhousie had declared Belvedere Estate as the official residence of the lieutenant governor of Bengal. The error is regretted.

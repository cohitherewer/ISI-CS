	A portion of Chakrabartipara Road in Rajdanga, off the EM Bypass, caved in on Sunday night, allegedly because of excavations to build a sports-cum-commercial complex.        
	Mackintosh Burn, a state government undertaking, executing the project on behalf of the Merlin Group and the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority, denied the allegation.        
	Some labourers working at the construction site panicked and ran away as almost half the 40ft-wide road in front of our apartment building developed cracks on Sunday night. One of the gates of the project site tilted precariously to one side, said Sujoy Mukherjee, a resident of the area.        
	The road was closed on Monday and repairs were carried out by Mackintosh Burn.        
	Last May, a part of the adjoining Rajdanga Main Road had caved in. Cracks had developed on adjacent houses and water supply was disrupted.        
	Mukherjee, a structural engineer, said the construction of Acropolis  the Rs 400-crore project comprising a 4,000-seat sports stadium, a 17-level business tower and a shopping mall with a four-screen multiplex  was endangering the lives and properties of residents.        
	The project site is surrounded by multi-storeyed buildings, schools, a guest house, government offices and a market.        
	Nilmoni Dhar, the managing director of Mackintosh Burn, said: We have taken precautions and there is no chance of a mishap. We hope to complete repairs in a couple of days.

          SUBHRO SAHA                              
	Brand Bengal doesnt cut ice with overseas investors because theres no concerted effort by the government to portray a positive image of the state, feels Fujio Samukawa, the new Japanese consul-general in Calcutta.        
	Look at (Narendra) Modi today. He is aggressively marketing his state as a viable investment destination through the Vibrant Gujarat campaign. Its all about eloquent PR and crafty packaging of your USPs, and someone should take that initiative here, Samukawa told Metro.        
	The diplomat underlined lack of infrastructure as the main hurdle to fresh Japanese investment and also called for a more hassle-free land-transfer system. In Japan, private enterprise negotiates directly with farmers for land and the government has no role in the process. Given the fragmented land-holding pattern here, that system is virtually impossible to introduce.        
	Of course, the East-West Metro is a great boost to Bengal-Japan ties, and theres always the possibility of expanding its scope further if the West Bengal government is interested. We can then approach Tokyo for further ODA (overseas development assistance) for the project, the consul-general observed.        
	Japan, which had declared India its most important partner for ODA, is ready to consider any proposal to help in the development of a freight corridor, a deep-sea port and a modern, international airport.        
	Samukawa sees a greater role for the various city chambers of commerce in boosting Japanese presence in Bengal. There are so many chambers here, who need to dovetail their respective agendas into an integrated vision plan and then engage Japanese business captains in dialogue, he said.

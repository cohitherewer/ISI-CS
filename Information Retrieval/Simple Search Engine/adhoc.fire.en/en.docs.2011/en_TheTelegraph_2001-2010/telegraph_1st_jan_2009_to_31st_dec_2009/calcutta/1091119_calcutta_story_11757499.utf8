	Calcutta University seems to have gone to the dogs. Rather, one dog. All activities at the universitys psychology department library had to be suspended on Tuesday and Wednesday because of an elusive stray dog.        
	The canine was locked inside the library on Tuesday and Wednesday nights after all attempts to remove it proved futile. Library activities may remain suspended for another day if the authorities fail to take it out on Thursday.        
	The stray, around a year old, had sneaked into the psychology department library housed on the second floor of Palit Building on the universitys Rajabazar Science College campus on Tuesday afternoon. I was reading when I saw the dog walk into our library. It crawled under a bookshelf and refused to budge, said a student on Wednesday.        
	Library employees and students tried to coax the dog out with biscuits but it paid no heed to them. The employees, however, didnt use force as students insisted that the dog not be harmed.        
	Reading and lending were stopped in the library as we felt it wouldnt be safe for students and the staff to remain inside, said an employee.        
	He said the dog was growling at anyone who tried to get close to it. Since it is a stray, we didnt want to take a chance, he said.        
	On Tuesday, the institute gave up operation evict dog at 7pm. The dog is being fed cup cakes, biscuits and bread from the canteen and has also been given water.        
	On Wednesday morning, the library staff found books and papers strewn across the floor. Computer wires had been chewed up and the entire library was in a mess, an employee said. The dog was hiding under a shelf.         
	We will approach the dog squad of the civic body for assistance on Thursday, said Amit Roy, the universitys science secretary.

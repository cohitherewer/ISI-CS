The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Jail boss feels cellphone heat
                                                                                                               Jail boss feels cellphone heat
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Cellphones, a DVD player, a knife and scissors were found in the cells of undertrials at Alipore jail. A Telegraph picture                                  
	The superintendent of Alipore Central jail, Kumaresh Ray, was held accountable for the presence of mobile phones and other items in the cells of undertrials and slapped with a showcause notice on Tuesday.         
	A raid on January 25 found six cellphones, three SIM cards, a DVD player, a knife and a couple of scissors in the cells of Gopal Tiwari, a murder accused, and Sona, an accused in the Khadims abduction case.        
	A preliminary probe revealed the mobile phones and other articles were smuggled into the jail through the main gate. Ray was held responsible as he is in charge of day-to-day activities in the jail, said B.D. Sharma, the additional director-general (prisons).         
	Departmental action would be initiated against Ray if he failed to provide a satisfactory reply, Sharma said.         
	The probe has also thrown up the names of some jail employees. We have unearthed the names of some warders who were involved. Exemplary punishment will be given to them, said a senior jail official.        
	According to him, the repeated recovery of cellphones from Presidency and Alipore jails has put security officials on their toes. Some jail employees help bring cellphones into the prison in exchange for money from inmates, who run extortion rackets from behind bars, the official said.        
	A home department official said the chief minister was concerned over security lapses in prisons like Alipore, where high-risk criminals like Aftab Ahmed Ansari are lodged.         
	State jail minister Biswanath Chowdhury said senior jail officials would conduct surprise raids inside jails in the city and its suburbs along with the police. Jail officials and warders will be under surveillance, he said.         
	Jail officials also pointed to the sorry state of the jammers installed in jails last year. The devices meant to render mobile phones inoperative on the jail premises are not working, said an official.

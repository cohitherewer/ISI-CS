          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jadavpur University (JU) has drawn up a plan to step up security on its 52-acre main campus after an outsider slashed an electronics engineering student in her department two weeks ago.         
	A series of measures will be taken soon to ensure better security on the campus, said vice-chancellor Siddhartha Dutta.         
	The plan, prepared after consulting local police authorities, would be placed before the executive council, the highest decision-making body of the university.         
	The blueprint envisages restrictions on entry of outsiders on the Jadavpur campus, installation of closed-circuit television cameras and mandatory identity cards.         
	The authorities are also considering a proposal to outsource security to private companies. Currently, 150 guards employed by the university look after security on the campus.         
	There is a proposal to monitor all the five gates round the clock to check unauthorised entry, said a member of the executive council.         
	Most of the gates are now kept open from morning to 7pm. Once the new measures are in place, the gates might be shut for some time in between. Entry logs might also be maintained. Closed-circuit television cameras might be installed near gates and vulnerable points.         
	The plan covers students hostels as well. A change in the exit and entry rules of hostel inmates is also on the cards, said a source. On an average, more than 10,000 people, many of them outsiders, visit the JU main campus.        
	It is not possible to scan each and every person entering the campus. To ensure the maximum possible security, students and staff members will have to carry their identity cards. Even students of Jadavpur Vidyapith and their guardians, who are allowed to take shortcuts through the campus, will have to carry their identity cards, said the source.

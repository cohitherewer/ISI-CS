The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Heads roll for Metro mess
                                                                                                               Heads roll for Metro mess
  - Officials blame it on lack of planning        SANJAY MANDAL                                                  
	The Metro mess has drawn first blood.        
	Three senior officials directly involved in the running of Metro Railway trains have been transferred in the past week for the poor services since the extended route till Garia Bazar was opened on August 23.        
	More heads will roll, sources said, as the railway ministry was not happy with the way the citys most preferred mode of public transport was being run.        
	Following growing commuter complaints and a sustained campaign by The Telegraph highlighting overcrowding, late running of trains and other passenger peeves on Metro tracks, the Railway Board had sent inspection teams from Delhi.        
	And now comes news of the transfers. While a Metro spokesperson termed them routine, a ministry official said over the phone from Delhi: The decision followed inspections by the Railway Board. The ministry is taking strong measures to bring Metro services back on track.        
	A section of officials, however, alleged the transferred trio were being made scapegoats for the ministrys lack of planning, which has left a short-staffed department saddled with too few rakes to cater to an ever increasing number of commuters.        
	Those shunted out of Metro for their alleged lapses are chief electrical engineer C.K. Pattanaik, chief signal and telecom engineer S.K. Das and deputy chief operations manager S. Roy.        
	Pattanaik was transferred 10 days ago and Das and Roy a few days later. Das is yet to move out because of some procedural reasons but the other two have taken up their new assignments.        
	The chief electrical engineer and chief signal and telecom engineer are key functionaries in the daily running of trains, looking after power supply, maintenance of rakes, and signalling and communication systems. The deputy chief operations manager, too, plays a crucial role in the operational matters.        
	At a programme on Saturday, railway minister Mamata Banerjee urged commuters to bear with the problems for another two to three months, after which she said the situation would improve.        
	Metro employees said transferring the three officials would not bring about any change as the real problems plaguing the transport system lay elsewhere.        
	The authorities should focus on upgrading infrastructure instead of looking for fall guys, said an official who refused to be named.        
	Thanks to the undue haste by the ministry to open the extended route, we could only look into the safety aspects ignoring the vital operational issues.        
	The services would improve only if the signalling and ticketing systems are upgraded, the official added.        
	Sources said that before operationalising the 5.8km stretch between Tollygunge and Garia Bazar, Metro officials had asked the Railway Board for 500 additional personnel. But only 109 were sanctioned.        
	The electrical department had sought 182 extra personnel but got only a handful, forcing it to withdraw employees from existing stations and redeploy them at the new ones, said a source.        
	We have been been writing to the railway ministry since 2004 for at least nine new rakes but not one has come, said Dilip Mukherjee, the general secretary of the Metro Railway Mens Union.        
	Following the extended run, the authorities have announced that 13 new rakes would start arriving in phases from October. But Mamata said on Saturday that the first lot would not come before November, signalling further chaos during Puja.

	A 39-year-old resident of Woodburn Park has been arrested for looting laptops, smartphones and other gadgets from tech executives at gunpoint.         
	According to police, Harshjit Singh Oberoi looted at least three laptops, one Blackberry phone and other costly gadgets between May 12 and 14.        
	Oberoi, the son of a Bhowanipore trader and graduate from a well-known city college, would walk into offices of Internet service providers late in the evening and claim that he wanted to buy a broadband connection for the 20 computers in his office.        
	After a detailed talk, Oberoi would ask someone from the outlet to accompany him to his office in Bhowanipore for a demonstration. On May 12, he led an executive from a company outlet on Camac Street into a taxi and took away his laptop and other gadgets at gunpoint on a deserted stretch in Hastings, said an officer.        
	On May 14, Oberoi visited a outlet in Chowringhee and did the same to the executive who accompanied him from there. The CCTV grabs of Oberoi at the Camac Street outlet helped us track him. We arrested him outside Howrah station, added the officer.         
	Oberoi confessed that he used to sell the gadgets in New Delhi, said the police.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Family held for attack on help
                                                                                                               Family held for attack on help
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A couple and their two sons  both in their mid-20s  were arrested on Wednesday on the charge of trying to kill their 13-year-old help on Tuesday night.        
	Attempt to murder charges have been filed against Bhupinder Singh Dhingra and Ravindra Singh Kaur and their two sons, Harmit and Kulbhusan, said Debasis Baidya, the officer-in-charge of Lake police station.        
	The officer said Sunil was found with his hands and legs tied in the Dhingras fourth-floor flat on Gobindapur Road, off Jodhpur Park. The flat was on fire and locked from outside. The family members were on the ground floor, said Baidya.        
	Neighbours said the family members used to torture the boy, said an officer working on the case. A probe is on to find out whether the family members had deliberately left the boy tied up in the flat and set it on fire. The motive is not yet clear but we do suspect foul play.        
	Sunil suffered minor burns and was taken to MR Bangur Hospital, where his condition was stated to be stable. The boy is from Bihar and was employed by the family two weeks ago.        
	Sleuths said neighbours alerted the fire services department around 8.40pm after spotting smoke billowing out of the flat. Firemen broke open the door and rescued the boy. Three tenders took more than an hour to bring the blaze under control.        
	As news spread, local people residents manhandled Dhingra and his family members. A police team rescued them and took them to AMRI Hospitals in Dhakuria.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Old buses off road,   new transit on track   Oct. 31 deadline for green switch
                                                                                                               Old buses off road,   new transit on track     Oct. 31 deadline for green switch
          OUR BUREAU                           SMOKE SIGNAL: Times up for old buses                                              
	The floundering foul-fume ban has got a fresh lease of life with the government setting October 31 as the deadline for submitting applications to replace commercial vehicles older than 15 years.        
	The government will assume that those not meeting the deadline are no longer interested in remaining in business. There wont be any extension of the deadline, nor any consideration for those who do not meet it, transport minister Ranjit Kundu declared on Tuesday.        
	The deadline, the first decisive step by the government on the matter since the high court clamped a ban on polluting vehicles on July 18 last year, was announced after Kundu separately met transport operators and manufacturers of commercial vehicles at Writers Buildings.        
	How can the government set a deadline when the matter is sub judice? shot back Sadhan Das, the general secretary of the Joint Council of Bus Syndicates.        
	As in the case of two-stroke autos  first ordered off the road with effect from January 1 but later given two extensions  compliance with the ban on old commercial vehicles has been dismal.         
	Kundu said that his department had so far received applications for replacement of only 465 of the 3,067 buses  including 510 minibuses  that were to be phased out by July 31. Of these 465 applications, 200-odd have been processed. Owners of 15 buses have deposited money and five new vehicles have been registered. The remaining 240-odd applications are being processed, the minister said.        
	Many of the old, smoke-belching buses were back on the road a couple of days after the ban took effect and the police stopped the crackdown.        
	Apart from putting owners of banned buses on notice, the government is considering expanding the list of suppliers of commercial vehicles as both Hindustan Motors, which manufactures the Ambassador, and Bajaj Auto are supposedly unable to meet the citys requirements.        
	Minister Kundu recently met officials from both companies and also spoke to the likes of Maruti-Suzuki, Tata and TVS to explore alternatives.

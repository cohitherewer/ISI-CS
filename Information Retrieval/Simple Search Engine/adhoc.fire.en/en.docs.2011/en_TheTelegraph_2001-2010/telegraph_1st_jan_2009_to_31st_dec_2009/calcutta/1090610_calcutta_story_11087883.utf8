                                                                                                               NRS nurses cease work
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Around 50 junior nursing interns at NRS hospital went on a hunger strike and ceased work for a few hours on Tuesday to protest non-payment of stipend.         
	After completing our third year, we started our internship in January, when we also became eligible for a stipend, said Kakoli Mondal, one of the protesting students. She added that the authorities had threatened to withhold their certificates if they agitated.         
	We met Shantana Kundu, the assistant director of health (nursing) on June 3, but she wasnt sure when we would get our dues, said Keka Roy, another student.        
	On Tuesday evening, the interns were told that their dues would be cleared soon. The nurses said they would wait till Thursday and then re-launch their agitation.

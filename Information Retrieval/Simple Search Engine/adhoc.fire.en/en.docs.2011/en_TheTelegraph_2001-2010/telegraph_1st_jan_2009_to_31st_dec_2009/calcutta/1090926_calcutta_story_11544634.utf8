                      The enigma of life                    Modern philosophical thought gives an impression that individuals are the master of the meaning and essence of their lives, and that this essence is defined by their existence. But for all practical purposes, we are still ignorant of how to traverse the journey of life. Ajnatobaas attempts to find a solution to the eternal human predicament and offers interesting clues to the motives that guide and control our lives. It introduces the audience to a lady well past her middle-age, looking for a place to rest. Payel, a newly-married woman, offers a glass of water to the old lady. In fact, she herself is looking for somebody to talk to, as she too is very lonely. Apprehensions and fears dominate the lives of Payel and her husband Soumik. They are confronted with a strange situation with respect to the old lady. They do not know how to handle someone who remembers nothing of her past, and yet, is so alive, so fascinating. The open-ended play leaves the audience asking many questions: Does the old woman remember her past at all? Where will she go from here? Will Payel and Soumik also follow in her footsteps? Direction: Sumanta Gangopadhyay.                    lEvent: Play in Bengali, Ajnatobaas, produced by Nandikar lWhen: Today at 3 pm amp; 6.30 pm lWhere: Academy of Fine Arts

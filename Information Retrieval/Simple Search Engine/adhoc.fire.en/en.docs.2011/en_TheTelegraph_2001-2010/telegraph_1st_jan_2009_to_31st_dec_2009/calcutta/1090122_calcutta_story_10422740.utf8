The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Twin rallies choke city 
                                                                                                               Twin rallies choke city 
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The traffic mess in central Calcutta on Wednesday.   Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                                        
	Two demonstrations  by para-teachers and car drivers  held the city to ransom on Wednesday afternoon, choking central Calcutta and giving commuters a harrowing time.        
	Around 2,000 government para-teachers from across the state converged in Metro channel around 12.30pm, demanding an increase in wages and that their jobs be made permanent.        
	Traffic on CR Avenue, SN Banerjee Road, Rani Rashmoni Avenue and JL Nehru Road was thrown out of gear for two hours when the agitators held a sit-in at Esplanade at 3pm. The ripple effects were felt in north and south Calcutta, too.        
	Around the same time, around 1,200 people, under the banner of the Calcutta Motor Drivers Union, held a demonstration near the Gandhi statue on the Maidan for over two hours, demanding a minimum monthly wage of Rs 5,000.         
	Commuters were the worst-hit. After sitting in the bus near Esplanade for over an hour, I got off and started walking. It is so painful, said Amit Das, on his way back home to Beleghata.        
	Brandishing placards and banners, the para-teachers sat in the middle of the road, from Metro cinema to the Esplanade crossing.        
	Police tried to bring the situation under control, but the agitators said they would budge only after an assurance from the chief minister that their demands would be met.        
	The cops then lathicharged the crowds to lift the blockade. Traffic movement was restored at 5pm. Around 100 people were arrested and released in the evening. We resorted to lathicharge as they were refusing to disperse, an officer said.        
	Ramiul Islam Sheikh, of the State Co-ordination of Para-teachers Association, admitted they had inconvenienced people. We are helpless. We, too, are suffering, he said. Around 54,000 para-teachers are working in state schools.

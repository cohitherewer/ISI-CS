                                                                                                               Big business of pampering pets silly

	You could be allergic to cats or dogs but the pet beauty business is not to be sneezed at.        
	The citys first pet mall has just come up on the EM Bypass, stocking every conceivable product to pamper a pet from head to tail.         
	Corona Metro, a larger version of the New Market store Corona that has been catering to dog owners needs for decades, has squashed a range of products and services into 1,000sq ft of retail space at the Metropolitan Housing Society. The shelves have everything from dental paste for dogs and cats to medication for bruised paws.         
	 Our New Market store is dedicated to products for dogs. The new one caters to dogs, cats, birds, fish and even pet rabbits, said K.K. Basu Roy, a partner in Corona Metro.         
	According to Basu Roy, the number of pets in Calcutta is increasing at the rate of 15-20 per cent annually, creating a large market for both essential and vanity products for pet dogs, cats, fish and birds.        
	But pet owners can be finicky customers; so detailed planning has gone into every aspect of the Bypass store. The interiors are in white and red, with polished floors. Aquariums of various sizes take up one wall.         
	Apart from the usual dog toys like rubber bones and balls and scratchboards for cats, the store offers winter clothing, cotton buds, imported and indigenous brands of food, diapers, dog shoes and even mouthwash. A dog bed in bright checks looks good to lie on and catch a few winks.        
	The medicine room is the stores USP. We are the only store with a section for veterinary medicines, Basu Roy said.         
	Shoppers can bring their pets along to the store, though a pet arena where they can be left to do their own thing hasnt been introduced yet.        
	The owners of Corona plan to start a pet crche in the city and periodically organise seminars and other programmes.        
	Vets like t2 columnist Goutam Mukherjee are all for more speciality stores like Corona Metro. Stores like Paws, Pet Pride and Corona have great potential. Pet owners are becoming more conscious about the grooming needs of their pets and such stores provide complete solutions.

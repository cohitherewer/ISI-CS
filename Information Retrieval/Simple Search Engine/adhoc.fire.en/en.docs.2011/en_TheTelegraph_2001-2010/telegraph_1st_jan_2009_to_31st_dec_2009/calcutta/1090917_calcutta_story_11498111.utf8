The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Browns latest a symbol of success
                                                                                                               Browns latest a symbol of success
          MALINI BANERJEE                          A customer flips through The Lost Symbol by Dan Brown at a city bookstore. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                                  
	With a sudden upwelling of reverence, Robert Langdon fell to his knees. For a moment, he thought he heard a womans voice... the wisdom of the ages... whispering up from the chasms of the earth.        
	It has been a six-year wait for fans craving more after reading those last lines of The Da Vinci Code.        
	The wait ended on Tuesday with the sequel to Dan Browns best-selling novel (that sold 200,000 copies in India alone) hitting the shelves.        
	Titled The Lost Symbol, the book is the third in a series featuring Langdon and is based on the secretive Freemasons, set in Washington DC over a 12-hour period.        
	Hundreds of copies of the page-turner were pre-ordered in the city. The craze is almost Harry Potter-like, said Gautam Jatia, the CEO of Starmark. Harry Potter is the only other book for which we took pre-booking orders. Nandan Nilekani and Amartya Sens books may be very fast movers but they arent booked in advance.        
	Starmark, which had offered discounts of between 10 and 20 per cent against pre-orders and online bookings, had ordered around 750 books, which it expects to be sold out in a week.         
	Sunny Purkayastha, a 24-year-old software engineer, may not have booked his copy in advance but was determined to get his hands on it as soon as possible. He headed for the Crossword bookstore at Sector Vs Technopolis the moment he finished work. And as he did with the last Langdon title he read  Angels and Demons  he continued reading The Lost Symbol through the night. I think I was up till 3am and dont know when I fell asleep. I have less than one third of the book left though, he grinned.        
	Crossword has ordered 500 copies. Considering its an expensive book (Rs 699), the pre-launch response has been very good, said Sidhartha Pansari, the managing director of Crossword. They have already ordered more copies and expect the current stock to be sold out by Puja.         
	Oxford Bookstore on Park Street has ordered 100 copies for now, said a spokesperson.         
	Initial supply to the market is 60,000 copies, said Manoj Satti, the manager (product and marketing) of Random House India, the publishers of the book.         
	Stores have not, however, planned events around the book as of now, as they did for the Harry Potter titles. And some are sceptical about the books chances in Calcutta.         
	People are already spending so much on their Puja shopping. They might not want to fork out Rs 700 for a book, felt an Oxford bookstore official.         
	But there are no plans of offering heavy discounts like the books retailers in the UK (like Asda, Tesco and Borders) who are offering 30-70 per cent discounts.         
	Explains Pansari: A price of 20 keeps a much higher margin of profit. So they can afford that kind of discount. In India Rs 700 is not that costly and leaves very little margin for such leveraging.        
	Random House, though, is hopeful. We are targeting 150,000 copies in India. The Lost Symbol is an intelligent, lightning-paced thriller that offers surprises at every turn, said Satti.

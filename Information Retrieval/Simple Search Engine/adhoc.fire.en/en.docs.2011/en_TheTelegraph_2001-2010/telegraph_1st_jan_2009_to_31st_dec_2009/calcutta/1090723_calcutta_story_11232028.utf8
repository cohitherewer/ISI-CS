                                                                                                               Traffic class in schools 
          OUR BUREAU                              
	The Madhyamik board is set to make traffic education and disaster management compulsory subjects in school.        
	Traffic education and disaster and crisis management both are likely to be incorporated in work education, a mandatory subject for students from classes V to VIII in the 12,500 Madhyamik schools across the state.        
	The board hopes to reduce the number of road mishaps and ensure the safety of students by making the two modules a part of the curriculum.        
	A few years ago, acting on a proposal by the city police, the board had allowed about a dozen schools in the city to teach traffic education.        
	Students have to commute to and from schools daily. With road mishaps increasing, we feel traffic education should be taught as part of work education so that students get hands-on training in road safety, said Partha Ray, the board secretary.        
	We often see parents who take their children to school walking on the wrong side of the road. This proves even mothers are unaware of traffic rules. Our aim is to impart traffic education in such a manner that youngsters remember the lessons even after they grow up, said a board official.        
	Lessons in disaster management will teach students how to react if there is a natural disaster or terrorist strike, added the official.        
	The board has written to the city and state police authorities asking them to draft a guideline for preparing a training module for work education teachers. After undergoing the training, the teachers will finalise what will be taught to the students in traffic education and disaster management.        
	Board officials recently met senior police officers to discuss the teaching modules.         
	We want the students to understand that the drivers are not the only ones responsible for road safety. Pedestrians, too, must follow rules, said K. Harirajan, the additional commissioner of police and the head of the police team working on the traffic safety module.        
	A team of college and university teachers and officials of the state disaster management group are working on disaster management module of the work education syllabus.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Shutdown saga
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Shutdown saga

	The central business district wore a deserted look, with the maximum impact being felt at Burrabazar. Even the wholesale markets had downed shutters. We had put up posters and our workers campaigned for the bandh for three days. Two councillors from the area belong to our party. We enjoy peoples support there, said Bhola Prasad, a BJP worker.        
	In Howrah, 45 people were arrested for bandh-related violence. At 6am, a state bus was set ablaze at Howrah bus stand. At 9.30am, 15 BJP supporters blocked the approach roads to Vidyasagar Setu near Mandirtala. Many commuters and students turned back, fearing trouble. At 10.30am, BJP men stopped buses on GR Road and forced the passengers out. Around noon, 25 BJP supporters blocked the station-end of Howrah bridge but the cops removed the blockade within 10 minutes.         
	In Salt Lake, bandh supporters blocked the Karunamoyee crossing and snatched car keys from drivers. They even threatened to set vehicles ablaze and deflated motorcycle tyres. The car keys were returned after the police intervened.

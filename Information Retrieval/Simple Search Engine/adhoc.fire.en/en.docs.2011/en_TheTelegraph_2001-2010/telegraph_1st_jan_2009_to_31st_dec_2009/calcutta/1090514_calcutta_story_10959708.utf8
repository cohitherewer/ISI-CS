          OUR BUREAU                          The scene of the clash between CPM supporters and CRPF men at Rabindranagar. (Pradip Sanyal)                                  
	Two persons were killed and several injured in election-related violence on the outskirts on Wednesday. Voting in the city was largely peaceful.        
	Khejer Ali Molla, 18, was killed at Baligori in Rajarhat after some armed men hurled a bomb at him and two others, said his father Wahidul. Khejer was a Trinamul Congress worker.        
	Jainal Mollah, a 52-year-old CPM supporter and panchayat member of Canning, under Joynagar parliamentary constituency in South 24-Parganas, was killed after Trinamul supporters allegedly threw bombs at him while he was coming out of a booth after casting his vote.        
	Three bombs were burst outside Purba Kolkata Bidyalaya, a polling centre on Raja Rajendra Lal Mitra Road in Beleghata, around 3.30pm, sending voters scurrying for cover.        
	Barring a couple of constables, policemen posted outside the school went looking for those who had thrown the bombs. Metro went up to the first floor and found men moving around the electronic voting machines and pressing buttons at will.        
	Half an hour later, three other explosions were heard in the distance. The Trinamul and the CPM blamed each other for the violence.        
	Nine outsiders were arrested outside polling centres in Salt Lake. Five of them were Trinamul supporters from Santragachhi in Howrah. They allegedly tried to enter a polling centre in Rishi Aurobindo Institute in Salt Lakes CK block.        
	CPM supporters allegedly hurled bombs outside some booths in Metiabruz to scare away voters.        
	At Panchur Lashkarpara Primary School in Rabindranagar, on the southern fringes, CRPF personnel stopped three alleged CPM supporters from casting bogus votes.         
	Later, a supporter of the party allegedly heckled a CRPF jawan before taking shelter in local CPM leader Serajul Islam Mondals house.        
	CRPF men ransacked the house and beat up Mondal, said CPM supporters, who demonstrated outside the polling centre demanding withdrawal of paramilitary forces, interrupting the voting process. With the cadres turning violent, the CRPF personnel were withdrawn from the centre. Senior officers of the CRPF denied the CPM allegations.        
	Trinamul supporters allegedly threw stones at Forward Bloc candidate Sudin Chatterjees car and attacked his security guard outside Naduria Madhyamik School at Ashokenagar, in Barasat constituency, around 12.30pm.        
	Nobody voted at Addir Abad in Sonarpur, under Jadavpur parliamentary constituency, demanding the supply of drinking water and electricity, and proper road.        
	Sitting MP Sujan Chakraborty of the CPM demanded repoll at 21 booths in Bhangar on the ground that his party agents were not allowed to discharge their duties by Trinamul supporters.

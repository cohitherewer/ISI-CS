The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Minibus falls into canal
                                                                                                               Minibus falls into canal
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A minibus bringing a 33-member group from Bonhooghly back to the city after an overnight picnic in the Sunderbans fell into a canal in Bantala on Sunday evening.        
	Residents of Basanti Road broke open the windows of the minibus with metal rods and rescued the passengers and the driver before police reached the spot.        
	Four of the injured were taken to Apollo Gleneagles Hospital. The rest were treated at Ruby General Hospital. Three men and woman suffered serious injuries. A child was having trouble breathing.        
	We might need to admit two or three passengers who suffered leg and head injuries. The rest are doing a lot better already. The child with breathing trouble will recover steadily, said Shibabrata Banerjee, the in-charge of the intensive care unit at Ruby.        
	The driver of the minibus lost control of the vehicle after taking a sharp turn, rammed into a shop beside the narrow road, broke a part of a culvert and fell into the canal, said South 24-Parganas police superintendent Ajey Ranade.        
	The driver will be punished if he is found guilty of negligent driving, said a cop.        
	A private bus had fallen into a canal at Kestopur last year killing over 20 passengers.

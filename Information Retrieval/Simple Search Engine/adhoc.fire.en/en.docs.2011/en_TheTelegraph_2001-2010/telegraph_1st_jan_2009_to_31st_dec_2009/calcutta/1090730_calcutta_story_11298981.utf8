The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Seat-cut row in varsity
                                                                                                               Seat-cut row in varsity
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Teachers of Calcutta Universitys Bengali department have requested the authorities to reduce the number of seats in the masters course, citing lack of faculty members.         
	Students have vowed to fight the proposal tooth and nail, alleging that the teachers were trying to reduce their workload to take classes for a separate course that offered a higher remuneration.         
	Of the 15 sanctioned posts for full-time teachers in the department, five are lying vacant. The masters course has 363 seats in three sections.        
	The teachers said in order to implement the universitys proposed semester system, the department would need to reduce the number of students in a phased manner.        
	The students, however, claim that there is no need to reduce the number of seats for introducing semesters.        
	The teachers want more time to teach in the universitys masters course in comparative Indian language and literature (CILL). The CILL is a self-financed course offered by CU and the teachers are paid extra per class for it, a student claimed.        
	The students said they would accept the demand for a seat cut but the authorities must give us an assurance that none of our teachers would be engaged for teaching the self-financed course.        
	The teachers want the authorities to reduce the number of sections in the masters course from three to two, and reduce student intake.        
	Sanat Kumar Naskar, the head of the Bengali department, however, said they had no intention of reducing the present intake. Under the semester system, we will have to conduct at least 10 exams every six months, which means more exam-related work. We felt there was a need to reduce the number of sections so we have fewer classes to take, he said.        
	The issue was discussed at a meeting of the CU syndicate on Wednesday. The syndicate felt the students demand to continue with three sections should not be ignored. The registrar has been asked to convey the opinion of the syndicate to the Bengali department. It is up to the department to take a final decision, said vice-chancellor Suranjan Das.

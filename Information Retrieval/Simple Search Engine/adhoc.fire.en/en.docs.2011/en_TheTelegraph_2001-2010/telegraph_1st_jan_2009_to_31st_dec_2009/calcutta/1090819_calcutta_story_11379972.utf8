                                                                                                               Tease protest draws blood 
  Youths shoot at pool car driver          A STAFF REPORTER                          Vinod Kumar Jaiswara at SSKM Hospital. (Pradip Sanyal)                                        
	The driver of a pool car was shot at in Metiabruz on Tuesday morning after he confronted three motorcycle-borne youths who were teasing the girls in the vehicle.         
	The bullet pierced through the left side of Vinod Kumar Jaiswaras chest but he still managed to get out of the vehicle, hire a rickshaw and reach Nadial police station around 2km away.         
	The cops, with help from their counterparts in Garden Reach police station, took the 26-year-old to SSKM Hospital where he was admitted in the intensive care unit of the cardio-thoracic department.         
	Doctors said he was out of danger but would be kept under observation for a few days.         
	The tease trio ran away immediately after firing at the driver and could not be tracked down till late on Tuesday. Their black Pulsar has been seized. We are trying to trace the owner of the bike, said an officer of Garden Reach police station.         
	A couple of local youths have been detained.         
	The police said the biker gang had targeted three girls  all Class IX students of Keshoram Cotton Mills High School  while they were waiting for the pool car at Bandabattala in Garden Reach around 6.15am.        
	The trio came up to them, saying the car would not come today and offered to give them a lift to their school, 2.5km from the spot, said an investigating officer.         
	The girls ignored the youths, who then left the spot. The car, a white Tata Sumo, arrived a few moments later and the girls got in.         
	But after the Sumo started moving, the youths kept shadowing the girls on their bike, passing lewd comments and making obscene gestures at them.         
	The car stopped twice on the way to school and picked up eight more girls and a teacher, the trio harassing the girls all along.                     
	When the girls could take it no more, the driver stopped the car at Mudiali and got off to confront the youths.         
	I asked them why they were teasing the girls, Jaiswara told Metro lying on his hospital bed.         
	The youths shot back: Tum apna kaam karo (you do your job). Ask one of the girls to join us.         
	When Jaiswara refused, the youths hurled a volley of abuse at him and threatened to teach him a lesson once he reached Metiabruz.         
	They kept their word. The gang blocked our way in front of the site for Metiabruz college, half-a-km from the school. They got off the bike and one of them fired at me, recalled Jaiswara, who lives in Paharpur with his parents.         
	The gunshot alerted residents who rushed to the spot but by then the youths had fled, leaving the two-wheeler behind. Some of the residents escorted the terrified girls and the teacher to the school.         
	The headmaster of Keshoram Cotton Mills High School, C.L. Singh, was shocked at the incident. This has never happened before. I have long been asking the police to step up security around the school but nothing has been done. Its time the cops acted as the security of our students and teachers is at stake, said Singh.         
	The teacher who was in the car along with the students has been left shattered by the incident, Singh added.         
	Ajmal Khan, who rushed out of his home hearing the screams of the girls and the gunshot, blamed lax policing for the incident. Patrolling should be intensified.         
	Asit Pal, the deputy commissioner of police (port), said a probe had been ordered. We have talked to the driver. A search is on for the youths.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Poll amp; politics   of environment
                                                                                                               Poll amp; politics   of environment
                            A poison-spewing autorickshaw				                                 
	If the state of the environment were to determine the fate of candidates from the city in Election 2009, their political aspirations would surely go up in smoke.         
	None of the environment issues affecting the health and general well-being of the citys population  and highlighted by Metro  figures in the list of priorities of any party, though Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee would have us believe that the Left Front is wholeheartedly working towards ridding Calcutta of air and noise pollution.We are trying(We) have already taken various steps, the chief minister said on the eve of polling day.        
	He explained the delay in implementing the ban on two-stroke autos by saying that one could not remove autos overnight.The livelihoods of many are linked to it.         
	While the ruling Left has hardly done a thing right when it comes to protecting the environment, the Opposition hasnt covered itself in green glory either.         
	Mamata Banerjee has hardly uttered a word on killer fumes emitted by autos but criticised the government for giving auto operators a raw deal.        
	Metro compiles a report card on the politics of the environment on the eve of polling.              
	AIR WE BREATHE        
	Toxic and a potent threat to our existence. The levels of harmful respirable particulate matter swimming in the air are way beyond the permissible limit. The main culprit is automobile emission.        
	Who is to blame?        
	Both the CPM and the Trinamul are ready to sacrifice lives at the altar of political gains. The transport lobby that blatantly flouts pollution norms not only adds to numbers in elections, but also provides muscle and money.         
	Govts score: 2/10        
	The proposal to phase out polluting two-stroke autos and ban commercial vehicles that are 15 years old or more came from the environment department. But the transport department has been trying to sabotage the move ever since the high court turned the notification into an order.         
	Oppositions score: 2/10        
	Has missed a trick because a sustained campaign showcasing the failures of government on the green front would have surely earned it points from environment-conscious urban voters.              
	WATER WE DRINK        
	Both quality and quantity are at stake. Ground water levels across the city have declined alarmingly over the years, not only triggering a shortage of drinking water but also raising the threat of subsidence. The salinity and presence of harmful substances in water have also been increasing steadily.         
	Who is to blame?         
	Unregulated real estate growth has caused depletion of groundwater reserves. Both the CPM and the Opposition give realtors a free run.        
	Govts score: 3/10         
	Several water supply projects have been launched over the years but hardly any effort has been made to solve the basic problem of excessive withdrawal of groundwater. It does not help that around 30 per cent of the filtered water meant for supply goes waste.         
	Oppositions score: 3/10        
	The Trinamul Congress tried to improve the supply of filtered water to households when it was in charge of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. But like the CPM, it never bothered to address the basic problem.               
	MAIDAN WE LOVE         
	It is the citys lungs and also the green patch that has been mauled the most. The book fair is not held there anymore, thanks to green activism and the high courts support. Political rallies, however, continue to be the bane of the Maidan.        
	Who is to blame?        
	Political parties and affiliated organisations consider it their birthright to hold rally-cum-picnics on the greens despite a high court-imposed ban on parking in the vicinity and cooking in the open within a 3km radius of Victoria Memorial. When the high court cracked the whip, the government launched a counter campaign to wrest control of the Maidan from the army.         
	Govts score: 1/10         
	The rating says it all, and there is no redemption in sight.        
	Oppositions score: 4/10         
	The Trinamul Congress and the rest of the Opposition are slightly less guilty of mauling the Maidan than the Left Front and its affiliates.               
	WETLANDS WE NEED        
	If the Maidan is the citys lungs, the East Calcutta wetlands off the EM Bypass are its kidneys. The wetlands act as natural sewage filters and are also a source of irrigation for the farmlands on the fringes. Although banned under law, these wetlands and ponds are being filled up to promote real estate.        
	Who is to blame?        
	Political parties again. They would rather please the realty lobby.        
	Govts score: 1/10        
	The only positive thing the government has done so far is form the East Calcutta Wetlands Management Authority. It is a different matter altogether that the panel has become more of a tool to fill up wetlands legally rather than protect them.        
	Oppositions score: 1/10        
	Considers wetland conservation a non-issue.               
	NOISE WE DROWN IN        
	Calcutta is the unofficial noise capital of the country despite the fact that Bengal was the first state to initiate steps to control noise pollution around a decade ago.         
	Who is to blame?        
	Every party.        
	Govts score: 3/10        
	The pollution control board and the environment department have been trying to control noise pollution caused by firecrackers but loudspeakers continue to be blatantly used.        
	Oppositions score: 2/10        
	They would rather raise the decibel level than lower it.       JAYANTA BASU

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | HC seal on IIT expel order
                                                                                                               HC seal on IIT expel order
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Friday upheld a decision by IIT Kharagpur to expel a student who had been arrested on the charge of possessing heroin.        
	The 20-year-old (name withheld), a third-year student of agriculture and food engineering, was held with 84g heroin on October 18 last year.        
	Justice P.S. Dutta, while upholding the expulsion order, set aside a lower court verdict which asked the institute to give the student a chance to reform.         
	The trial court has no authority to intervene in the administrative matters of an institute, he observed.        
	R.N. Majumdar, who appeared for the IIT, said the institute had abided by its norms in expelling the student. The student was expelled on October 21 following an inquiry.        
	The Supreme Court has ruled that any person possessing more than 10g of heroine or any other narcotic substance should be punished with up to 10 years in jail.        
	But a Kharagpur court on October 27 granted bail to the student and asked him not to consume liquor or drugs in future. The student, a resident of the town, promised to obey the order, after which the judge asked the IIT not to expel him.        
	A week later, the IIT informed the judge it had expelled the student. The court then set aside the expulsion order and asked the institute to allow the student to continue his studies.        
	The institute moved the high court challenging the trial courts order.         
	Milan Mukherjee, the students lawyer, sought an opportunity for his client to rectify his mistake. The judge turned down the plea.

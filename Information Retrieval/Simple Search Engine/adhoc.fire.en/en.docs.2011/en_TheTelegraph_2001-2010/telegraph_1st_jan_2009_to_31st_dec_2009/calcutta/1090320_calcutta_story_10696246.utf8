                                                                                                               Holiday ends in tragedy
          OUR BUREAU                          Kanchan Nandi and his daughter died in the mishap                                   
	A Calcutta-based PWD engineer holidaying in north Bengal with his family died along with his teenaged daughter in a road accident in the foothills near Siliguri on Thursday afternoon.        
	Kanchan Nandi, 48, wife Maya and the couples 14-year-old daughter Nilanjana were headed for Lava in a hired Maruti Alto when the car collided with a lorry coming from the opposite direction at Tenth Mile on NH 31A, around 30km from Siliguri town        
	Nilanjana died on the spot while Nandi, who was critically injured along with his wife and driver Prasad Sarkar, succumbed on way to hospital.        
	Maya, who suffered head and abdomen injuries, and the driver are in the ICU of a private nursing home in the town.        
	Nandi was the executive engineer of the PWDs designing division and a resident of GD Block in Salt Lake. The family of three had reached Siliguri by bus in the morning and checked into the PWD inspection bungalow. They rested for a few hours before leaving for Lava around 2.30pm.        
	Rakesh Singh, the subdivisional police officer of Kurseong, said the accident occurred around 4pm. Our officers at Sevoke police station heard about the accident from some drivers and reached the spot. The lorry driver and his help had fled by then, leaving the vehicle behind.        
	Chanchal Choudhury, a Siliguri-based uncle of Maya, said the Nandis were to stay in Lava for a night or two and then proceed to Loleygaon, near Kalimpong. I cant believe a family holiday has ended in such a tragedy, he cried.        
	Mayas sister Jayashree Basu, a resident of Garia, told Metro that she received a phone call from her sibling almost immediately after the accident. My sister could barely speak. She mumbled everythings over before hanging up. She didnt take my calls after that, she said.        
	Nilanjana, a student of Class VIII in South Point School, had called her aunt in the morning to say that she and her parents had reached Siliguri safely.        
	The Nandis neighbours in Salt Lake didnt know about the accident until some reporters knocked on their doors late in the evening.        
	I had spoken to them when they were leaving home for the bus terminus on Wednesday. Nandi told me they were going on a holiday. The family loved travelling and used to go on trips at least thrice a year, said 50-year-old Dattatreya Das, who stays next door.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Garbage vat woes for Buddhist temple
                                                                                                               Garbage vat woes for Buddhist temple

	The authorities of a Buddhist temple in central Calcutta are up in arms over an open garbage vat in their backyard which they alleged the civic authorities had not been relocating despite repeated pleas.        
	Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya admitted that the vat needed to be shifted but asked temple officials to scout for an alternative space.        
	The vat is located barely a couple of feet from the temple in Kapalitola, behind Bowbazar police station.        
	Three years have passed since we first requested the Calcutta Municipal Corporation to relocate the vat but nothing has been done. The vat has become a nuisance and is polluting the air, said Hemendu Bikash Chowdhury, the secretary of the Bengal Buddhist Association which runs the temple.        
	With the CMC sitting tight on the request, the temple authorities have sought help from the West Bengal Minorities Commission.        
	Its strange that the CMC sees nothing wrong in the situation though the pollution control board has confirmed that the vat is causing pollution. We have written to the mayor and the municipal commissioner urging them to remove the vat immediately from the backyard of the century-old temple, said Kalyan Chaudhuri, the vice-chairman of the minorities commission.        
	The mayor pleaded helplessness. I know its wrong to have a vat near a place of worship or a school. If the temple authorities suggest an alternative space, we will definitely shift the vat, he said.         
	The 117-year-old temple, visited by foreign nationals and people from across the country, also runs a secondary school and a healthcare unit for the poor on the premises.        
	Local residents, too, are peeved with the civic bodys indifference to the problems they are facing because of the open vat. The environment in the neighbourhood is unhygienic, thanks to the vat, said a resident.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Crowd catches cops with pants down
                                                                                                               Crowd catches cops with pants down
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Residents of a Howrah locality spent Sunday afternoon cheering three bumbling policemen in gamchas as they scoured a hyacinth-filled pond for a thief who had given them the slip.         
	Sushanta Patra, 25, was being taken to a police jeep along with his accomplice, 32-year-old Lakhinarayan Sadhukhan, when he freed himself from a constables grip and jumped into the pond. The three policemen in the team spent the next hour huffing and puffing through the thick layer of hyacinth that camouflaged the thief.         
	By the time they traced and fished out Sushanta, who had employed the old survival strategy of breathing through a reed in his mouth while he kept his head underwater, residents of Dasnagar had had their share of free entertainment.        
	We had caught the duo and handed them over to the police. When one of them jumped into the pond, the cops appeared clueless and requested us to help. We told them it was their responsibility to ensure that the thief did not disappear. They had no choice but to jump in, said Saibal Nayak, a resident of Kamardanga.        
	As the three policemen took the plunge with borrowed gamchas wrapped around their waists to cover their modesty, word got around about the show and a crowd gathered near the pond.         
	I dont mean to insult them but three policemen stripping down to their innerwear to enter a pond and hunt for a thief cant be anything but funny, giggled housewife Bela Bhowmik.        
	Sushanta, a repeat offender, and Lakhinarayan had burgled some lathe units when the residents were busy in a community puja on Saturday night.         
	When some youths accosted Sushanta in the morning, he confessed to the crime and promised to return whatever he and his accomplice  a part-time factory worker  had stolen. But he was nowhere to be found until around 2 in the afternoon, when someone spotted him and Lakhinarayan drinking in a shack near the Kamardanga minibus stand.        
	Residents beat up the duo before calling the police. They would have been lynched had the police team not arrived, a witness said.        
	After the drama in the pond ended, the two thieves were taken to a government hospital for first-aid. The three policemen might have needed treatment, too  for injured pride.

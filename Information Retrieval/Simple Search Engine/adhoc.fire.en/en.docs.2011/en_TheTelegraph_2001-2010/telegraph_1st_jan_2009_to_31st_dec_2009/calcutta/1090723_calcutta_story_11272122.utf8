The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Minister to meet bus, taxi lobby 
                                                                                                               Minister to meet bus, taxi lobby 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The transport minister will meet transport operators on Thursday to avert the indefinite transport strike from Friday. The CPM labour wing, Citu, also announced on Wednesday that it would oppose the strike.        
	I am meeting the transport operators at Netaji Indoor Stadium at 4.30pm tomorrow. They must let good sense prevail and call off the suicidal strike, which will only lead to chaos. There is no way we can defer implementation of the high court order on the phase-out of old vehicles, Subhas Chakraborty said at Writers Buildings on Wednesday.        
	The politically motivated strike would only inconvenience the common man. We have deferred the crackdown on polluting vehicles by five days (from July 25 to July 30). Whats the point of the strike? We are regularly meeting the transport operators and listening to their views. I am hopeful that they would see reason, added Chakraborty.        
	According to the minister, if the government delayed implemention of the ban, the chief secretary, home secretary and the transport secretary will be arrested.        
	Chakraborty attended a meeting of the West Bengal Road Transport Workers Federation at the Citu state headquarters on Wednesday evening.         
	Both the minister and Citu leaders called the strike illegitimate after the meeting.        
	According to Citu leaders, the government will requisition school buses and run them if the owners go ahead with the strike.        
	Swarnakamal Saha, the president of the Bengal Bus Syndicate and a spokesperson for the Banijyik Paribahan Bachao Committee, an umbrella body of transport operators, said the strike would take place barring a miracle.        
	Tarak Nath Bari, the secretary of the Calcutta Taxi Association and member of the committee, echoed him.

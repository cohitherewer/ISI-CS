The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Court raps CU for admission bias
                                                                                                               Court raps CU for admission bias
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	A high court ruling on Friday implied that Calcutta University must follow the same set of rules for admitting students from its affiliates as well as from autonomous colleges to postgraduate courses.        
	Justice Dipankar Dutta ordered the university to admit Suraj Konar and nine other students from St Xaviers College who had alleged that they were being denied berths on the basis of discriminatory admission criteria for candidates from affiliates-turned autonomous institutions.        
	The Park Street institution, a CU affiliate till 2006, was the first city college to be granted autonomy. The first batch from the college since it was accorded the new status graduated this year.        
	Justice Dutta, who ruled that the 10 students would have to be taken in by September 16, said: The university cannot behave like a stepmother to the students who have graduated from St Xaviers College.        
	The university was also asked to waive the tuition fee of the petitioners for a year as damages for harassing them by denying them admission.        
	The petitioner students are victims of the decision taken by the university syndicate to admit students of St Xaviers College to postgraduate courses on the basis of normalisation of marks. The syndicate members should be penalised for taking such a decision, the judge observed.        
	Normalisation is a statistical tool by which the university tried to achieve a parity between the results of St Xaviers students and those from the affiliated colleges.        
	Students from affiliated colleges are admitted to CUs postgraduate programmes either on the basis of their scores in the admission test or marks in the undergraduate exams.        
	The petitioners  who sought admission in physics, chemistry, mathematics and computer science  stated in their petition that students from affiliated colleges with marks lower than theirs got admission to these courses because of the universitys discriminatory criteria.        
	A lawyer for St Xaviers College, which was made a party to the case, said: The university itself had approached the UGC for granting us autonomy. Now, how can it behave with us like a stepmother?        
	CU lawyer Sambuddha Chakraborty said: The admission criteria that was challenged was only for this year. The university has already announced that it will follow a different policy for admitting students to postgraduate courses from next year.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Stabs on hand for 5 lakh loot
                                                                                                               Stabs on hand for 5 lakh loot
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two youths stabbed a trader on his hands with knives and snatched his briefcase containing Rs 5 lakh in front of the gate of his apartment block on Foreshore Road, in Howrah, early on Monday.        
	The duo are yet to be identified. A complaint has been lodged with Shibpur police station. We have started a probe and raids are being conducted on various hideouts in the district. The two will be caught soon, said an officer.        
	Agarwal, who trades in pulses and operates from his Posta office, reached Howrah station from Jamshedpur by the Jnaneswari Express at 4am and took an autorickshaw home.        
	He reached his housing estate, Vivek Vihar, around 4.20am and was waiting for the guard to open the gate when the two youths, armed with knives, stopped him and tried to snatch his briefcase.        
	When I resisted they started stabbing at my hands. I let go of the briefcase when they threatened to slit my throat, said Agarwal.        
	The youths then walked across Foreshore Road and disappeared into a lane. The duo must have been tipped off that the trader was carrying money, said an officer.

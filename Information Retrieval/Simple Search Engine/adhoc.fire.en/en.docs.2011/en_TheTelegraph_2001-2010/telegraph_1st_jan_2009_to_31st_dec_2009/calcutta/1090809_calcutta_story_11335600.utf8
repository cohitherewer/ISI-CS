The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Like a bomb
                                                                                                               Like a bomb
										      book bazaar                                  Kishore Chatterjee at the launch.   (Rashbehari Das)      
	Kishore Chatterjees book on Western classical music titled Beethoven and Friends and published by Niyogi Books is a classic example of a newspaper column turning into a book and being totally transformed in the process.         
	After launching the book on Friday, actor Soumitra Chatterjee told the audience at Oxford Bookstore that Western classical music had helped him face adversities.         
	Kishore Chatterjee said that when he first heard the eve-teasing song Ke tumi nandini from Teen Bhubaner Pare, he immediately thought of Handel and Georg Philipp Telemann. During the filming of Shakha Prashakha, Kishore Chatterjee said, Satyajit Ray asked him to hum snatches of Beethoven. It was difficult, he admitted, and his voice did not match that of the actor. Ultimately, Ray himself hummed those pieces.        
	Dikoo Naoroji, who discussed the book along with Indranil Poddar, praised Kishore Chatterjees book for its historical sweep while Poddar liked his sudden insights. Kishore Chatterjee said the sound world of Beethoven was like nobody elses, perhaps because he was deaf. Beethoven began with a bang like a terrorist dropping a bomb. He compared it with Suchitra Mitras Rabindrasangeet.        
	In reply to a question, Kishore Chatterjee said Wagner was a deeply religious man and it was Hitler who found him, and not the other way round.

                                                                                                               2 youths killed in car crash

	Two youths were killed and three injured when the car in which they were heading home after a late dinner at a restaurant rammed into a truck on APC Roy Road, in Rajabazar, early on Sunday.        
	Kishan Bagaria, 29, an assistant manager with retail chain Baazar Kolkata, who was driving the Hyundai i10, died on the spot. Jimmy Thakkar, 27, a supplier of cables, succumbed to his injuries at Calcutta Medical College and Hospital.        
	The three others in the car  Bimal Bajaj, Sumit Daga and Kishans younger brother Kamal  were also taken to the College Street hospital but later shifted to private healthcare units.        
	Tyre marks, stretching across 25 metres, suggest the north-bound car was travelling at high speed and had swerved left after the driver slammed the brakes possibly to avoid something. The car might have lost control and smashed into the truck that was parked near Rajabazar tram depot, said an officer of Amherst police station.        
	A probe revealed that the men had eaten at a Ballygunge dhaba and were on their way home when the accident occurred around 3.45am.        
	Kishan Bagaria, who returned from Guwahati on Saturday evening, was an expert driver, said colleague Ashis Das. Kishan, originally from Raniganj, lived in a rented flat in Lake Town with brother Kamal, who has suffered multiple cuts in the face. Jimmys uncle Mukesh said: He had gone out with friends around 10.30pm on Saturday. The cops called us just before dawn. The family then rushed from their Muktaram Babu Street home.        
	 Bird-hit: A Kingfisher Airlines flight, carrying 107 passengers, suffered a bird-hit just before landing at Calcutta airport around 8.15pm on Sunday. The right wing suffered damage, said an airline official. The aircraft was set to return to Delhi with 134 passengers, including police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti. The official said the passengers would be sent on another flight.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Safe tag for fake products
                                                                                                               Safe tag for fake products
          TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                          Fake ISI stickers being prepared in a shop near Subodh Mullick Square. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                  
	Stickers bearing the ISI mark, which the central government issues to products found reliable after tests, are being duplicated and sold over the counter.         
	Metro found computer-generated leaves of fake stickers  each of them with an Indian Standard Number, which is supposed to be a unique code for each ISI tag  in shops around Subodh Mullick Square and in Mullickbazar.        
	A single sticker was priced around Rs 10, and a leaf of 12 around Rs 100. The price depends on the product for which the sticker is meant. Stickers for helmets are the most popular.        
	We are selling around 10 to 15 leaves daily for the past month. The demand has increased since the police started booking riders wearing helmets without ISI mark, said a shopkeeper at Subodh Mullick Square.        
	Traffic cops said they found it difficult to tell fake ISI stickers from originals.         
	We only act if we get a specific complaint from companies whose products are being faked and sold with false ISI stickers. Raids are conducted on the basis of preliminary reports filed by firms after market surveys, said Chanchal Dutta, the deputy commissioner (enforcement branch) of Calcutta police.        
	According to him, it is difficult to detain those who sell fake ISI stickers in the absence of a specific complaint.        
	Officials of the Bureau of Indian Standards, which issues the ISI stickers, said that they were meant for around 100 varieties of products under broad categories like food, building material and leather goods.        
	The marking fee starts from Rs 6,000.        
	We had received complaints about fake ISI products from other parts of the country. If the police and the enforcement branch do not act fast, the market will be flooded with hazardous products bearing fake ISI tags. Consumers will not suspect the products are unsafe because they trust the government certificate, said an official of the city office of the bureau.        
	The ISI tag is granted after ascertaining the capability of the manufacturer to produce goods of satisfactory quality. The samples provided by companies are also tested.

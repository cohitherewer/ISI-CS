The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Discomfort mounts in cruel month
                                                                                                               Discomfort mounts in cruel month
  - Norwester remains elusive, power cuts trigger spurt in inverter sales          OUR BUREAU                  A boy uses an oversized helmet as sun screen on Monday. Picture by Aranya Sen    
	The city wilted under a summer assault on Monday with the discomfort index touching 64.2 degrees Celsius, a cruel 9 degrees above normal.        
	The weatherman blamed the high discomfort index  measured on the basis of temperature, wind-flow pattern, humidity and other factors  on the abundance of moisture in the lower troposphere.        
	As the promised Norwester remains elusive despite favourable atmospheric condition since April 8, the mercury has been consistently remaining above normal for the past few days. Mondays maximum temperature was 38 degrees Celsius, two degrees above normal, and the relative humidity rose to 90 per cent.        
	Adding to the discomfort were intermittent power cuts stretching up to an hour throughout the day. CESC officials said there was no shortage of power on Monday but they still had to resort to a 40-MW loadshedding to prevent overloading of the transformers at the utilitys Prinsep Street distribution station. The transformers would have tripped had we not resorted to loadshedding, said an official.        
	The heat-power cut combine has triggered a spurt in the sale of inverters. More and more families are opting for home inverters. Only 20 per cent of Calcuttas customers are offices and organisations, said Sanjay Pal, who runs an inverter showroom in Beleghata. The prices of inverters have fallen sharply  by around Rs 600-2,000 compared with the summer of 2008  with the rising demand resulting in the entry of more players in the city market. Companies like Su-Kam, Hyundai, Bajaj and Whirlpool have come to cash in. Last year, when power cuts made a comeback, Luminous and Microtek were the only players, added Pal.        
	Many buyers are from Salt Lake, Kankurgachhi, Phoolbagan, Beleghata, Ultadanga, Lake Town, Baguiati and areas along VIP Road, which have been experiencing a lot of power cuts this summer. I had to go beyond my budget and purchase an inverter in March as my younger sister was appearing in the HS exams, said Arnab Roy, 27, a resident of Kankurgachhi.

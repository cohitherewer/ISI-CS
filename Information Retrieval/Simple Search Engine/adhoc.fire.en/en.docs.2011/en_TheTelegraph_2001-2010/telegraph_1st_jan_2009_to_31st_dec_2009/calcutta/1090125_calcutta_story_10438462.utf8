The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | On kathak and tap dance 
                                                                                                               On kathak and tap dance 
										      CITY LIGHTS                                        Das (left) and Smith practise their steps. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya        
	Its not fusion, but a conversation. Or perhaps an experimental conversation. But when Emmy award winning American tap-dancer Jason Samuels Smith, who looks like a healthier Bob Marley, breaks into a flurry of foot-taps to Sabir Khans bols, followed by Pandit Chitresh Dass frenzied kathak, it doesnt look like an easy conversation.         
	Das and Smith will perform together at a city event. Smith says the bols aloud, which sound strangely pleasant in his gravelly American-accented voice, while dancing in heavy boots. It looks fun.        
	Its not going to be fusion, since we arent exactly trying to combine the styles. We are staying true to our styles, says Jason. He says kathak is challenging. We concentrate on what it sounds like and not what it looks visually. My body thus follows my feet. But with kathak its not just the feet. Its the eyebrows, the shoulders, the neck, and to do all that while concentrating on your footwork is extremely challenging, he says.         
	But the twain does meet. I use my shoes to separate the heel and toe and get different sounds out of them. He (Das) uses his heel and toes while the arch plays the role of a drummers hands. He cups them differently to get a different or stronger sound. But even through the sawal jawab the goal is the same.         
	Das and Smith will perform in Azmaish (an experiment), an event organised by the Weavers Studio Centre for the Arts on January 30 at GD Birla Sabhagar. The programme will feature a recital by Tarun Bhattacharya on santoor and tabla artists Sabir and Arif Khan.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Luxury hatches zoom into city
                                                                                                               Luxury hatches zoom into city
          ANASUYA BASU                          Tata Motors is set to bring Fiats luxury hatch, Cinquecento, to Calcutta                                  
	A fleet of luxury and super luxury hatches are following the worlds cheapest car into the city.         
	Tata Motors, the maker of the Rs 1-lakh Nano, will bring the most expensive small car from its Fiat stable to Calcutta. Come August, the Rs 15-lakh Fiat 500 or Cinquecento (Italian for 500) is going to share space with Nano in the three Tata dealerships in the city.        
	This was announced by Rajeev Kapoor, the CEO of Fiat India Automobiles, during the recent launch of the Fiat Grande Punto in New Delhi.         
	The Cinquecento will be imported as a Complete Built-up Unit (CBU) from Fiats factory in Poland. A separate marketing strategy has been drawn up for the revived three-door four-wheeler, an Italian style icon of the 50s.        
	Awareness will be generated in all the tier 2 and tier 3 cities and the vehicle will be there in the showrooms for all to see, said Ricky Walter, the head of CBU imports and exports of Fiat India Automobiles.        
	Calcutta is witnessing a fierce competition in the B++ or the super hatch segment as companies vie for market share with multiple offerings.        
	The segment pepped up with the launch of Hondas Jazz, priced over Rs 7 lakh.        
	The Rs 5.5-lakh plus Fabia from Skoda has been commanding a market share of around 8 per cent in the city since its launch in January 2008, said Ashutosh Dixit, the general manager (sales) of the Indian arm of the company.        
	On an average, Calcutta sells about 30 units a month, he added.         
	The Jazz seems poised for a healthy run in the city with 200 units being sold in the east, which is dominated by Calcutta, in the first month of its launch.        
	Jazz aims to create a new segment in the market, just below the Honda City, the companys entry-level sedan. Jazz shares the same platform as the City and offers the spaciousness and comfort of a much bigger car along with utility, said Saba Khan of Honda Siel Cars India.

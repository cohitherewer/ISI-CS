The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Schools firm on fee hike in protest wake
                                                                                                               Schools firm on fee hike in protest wake
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The missionary position on raising school fees to offset the pay hike for teachers wont change despite political parties showing solidarity with some agitating parents, say church officials.        
	Representatives of church organisations met on Thursday to discuss the disruption of academic activities in schools that have hiked their fees and decided not to bow to the demands for a rollback or negotiate with any political party.        
	Our schools depend mostly on fees for sustenance. We had no choice but to increase fees to implement revised pay scales for our staff (in accordance with the recommendations of the Fifth Pay Commission), said Lucas Sirkar, the archbishop of Calcutta (Roman Catholic) and the president of the West Bengal Association of Christian Schools, after the meeting.        
	The fee hike ranges between 40 and 80 per cent in various Christian missionary schools.        
	Sirkar pleaded with parents and guardians not to involve outsiders in the issue. Our doors are open for discussion with every guardian, if he/she has a problem, he said.        
	Representatives of the Roman Catholic Church, Church of North, Methodist Church and the Bengal Baptist Union attended the meeting.         
	The church authorities said parents needed to understand what had prompted institutions to increase their fees. We need good teachers to continue offering a high standard of education. A hike in fees is unavoidable if we are to pay our teachers well and retain them, said Sister Cyril, the principal of Loreto Day School, Sealdah.         
	Sources said the church authorities were willing to implement the fee hike in phases in schools where most students are from middle class and lower middle class families.         
	Classes in several Christian missionary schools in the city have been disrupted over the past few days with parents and guardians demanding a rollback of the fee hike.         
	Church representatives accused a section of political leaders of instigating parents and guardians to protest and trying to turn the fee hike into a poll plank.        
	According to an official of a school on the southern fringes of the city, workers of a particular party have joined forces with disgruntled parents to disrupt academic activities.         
	They are preventing even willing parents and guardians from sending their wards to school, he alleged.        
	Another political party has taken up the cudgels for parents whose wards study in a central Calcutta school.        
	The only way out of this mess is for schools to take parents into confidence, a church official said.

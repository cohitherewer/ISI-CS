The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Party ban on cops off duty
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Party ban on cops off duty
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta police will keep a close watch on revellers and impose restrictions on their own men who are not on duty on New Years Eve to prevent any untoward incident.         
	Policemen in barracks have been asked not to attend parties in public places. They will also not be allowed to consume liquor on that night, said an officer at Lalbazar.        
	A roll call will be held in the barracks on Thursday night and if anyone leaves without permission, he will face departmental action, he said. Sources said the restrictions on cops were drawn up to prevent a repeat of the fatal incident involving sergeant Bapi Sen on December 31, 2002.        
	We will ensure that the restrictions are followed strictly, unlike in the past couple of years, said another officer.        
	A tight security ring will be thrown around Park Street on the festive night. More than 2,000 policemen will be deployed under the supervision of senior IPS officers and assistant commissioners of police in the Park Street-Shakespeare Sarani area. Officers will keep an eye on the crowds from three watch towers too, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters).        
	Officers will be posted in front of hotels, bars and restaurants. They will also patrol the roads to book speeding vehicles and two-wheeler riders without helmets, he added.        
	Shamim also said the drive against drink driving would be stepped up.         
	Officers will check motorists manually and with breath analysers. If a motorist is found intoxicated, he or she will be sent for a medical test, he said.

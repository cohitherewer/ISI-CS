The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | New look at Tagore 
                                                                                                               New look at Tagore 
                          (Above) A production at Rabindra Utsav; (below) Mriganka Chatterjee				                                 
	It started with an adda one evening when Habib Tanvir, one of Indias leading theatrepersons who died recently, commented that Tagore had not reached the rest of the country and the world as he should have and that the Bengalis keep their most iconic figure locked to themselves. Rabindra Utsav was born.         
	In its fourth year now, being held from August 1 to August 10, the festival is getting bigger and better, with an attempt to reach an audience beyond the professional circuit and Calcutta. The festival will be held in Calcutta and Kalyani. School students will hold separate performances at EZCC.         
	Organised by Happenings, a group of Calcuttans and Calcutta lovers, Rabindra Utsav aims to give theatre-lovers and actors across the country a chance to interpret Tagore a new way.         
	The first few years we had Durga Puja as our subject. When Habib Tanvir mentioned Tagore, we decided to popularise his works, says Vijay Iyengar, a member of Happenings. This was around 2004, when the copyright on Tagores works was removed.        
	The first year there were only plays: Habib Tanvirs Rajrakt, adapted from Tagore, K.N. Panikkars Raja, performed in the artistic forms of Kerala, H. Kanhailals Dakghar, in which a woman played Amal, and Suman Mukhopadhyays Raktakarabi, which set the play in a contemporary perspective.         
	The directors were chosen by Tanvir, but they were given full freedom with their presentation. The only condition was that it had to be an original production for the festival. From the next year, the festival was open to any work of Tagore.         
	Reinterpreting Tagore in Calcutta is not easy. The people here are touchy and used to seeing Tagore in a certain way. But we welcome the debate and discussion, says critic Samik Bandopadhyay. In Calcutta today, the audience is divided into many groups, the Bengali play audience, the English audience and others. We are trying to bridge these gaps.         
	In its first year, the festival drew flak from conservatives. I was deeply moved by Kanhailals Dakghar. But a few weeks later, at another theatre festival in the city, I saw the play being caricatured, remembers Kaushik Sen, who has participated in the festival in subsequent years. He claims that Bidhushak, performed at the festival in 2007, remains the most successful play of Sapnasandhani, his group. Everyone sees the works put up here and are moved to try something new in their own productions, he says.         
	Theatre person Vikram Iyengar, who has also been a part of the festival, feels this the test of a classical piece is whether it can lend itself to a contemporary interpretation.        
	This year the performances include Amitajyoti, by Manipuri dance exponent Bimbavati Devi and Rabibar by Sohag Sen.         
	For many years I have shied away from Tagore because of the pressure to conform to conventional ways of doing it. But this is a very different production. We have mixed Tagores writings on the cosmos, with some of his songs and included Sanskrit slokas and Manipuri dance and martial art forms, Bimbavati Devi explained.         
	Green plastic        
	Jadavpur resident Mriganka Chatterjee is a firm believer in entrepreneurship. What he didnt bargain for was being the proprietor of what he claims to be West Bengals first green plastic recycling unit.         
	Plastic waste is a problem everywhere. From reducing micron counts to banning plastic the governments have tried everything, but what is necessary is green recycling, he says.         
	HC Plastic, a plastic recycling unit owned by Mriganka and his father Dipak Chatterjee operates under an MoU between the firm and Rajpur Sonarpur Municipality in South 24-Parganas. His unit collects used plastic, cleans it and processes it into granules, which can be used by manufacturers of products.         
	We follow the norms set by the West Bengal pollution control board and have pollution control devices to mitigate air pollution. Our employees wear a special device in their ears to protect their hearing, says Mriganka.         
	But it isnt easy. Often there isnt enough raw material as the plastic is sold to kabadiwalas and illegal recyclers, who break down plastic in a process that leads to pollution, from the area. Besides the machines that ought to need repairs every two years need so every six months as the waste along with the plastic causes wear and tear. Every repair costs about Rs 40, 000 to Rs 50,000, says Mriganka. If there were more tax breaks and incentives, more young entrepreneurs would be in this line.         
	It can also contribute plastic to road-building. Plastic and roads? Yes, a professor Vasudevan from Madurai University has a patent over a system that uses plastic bitumen for making roads. The plastic flakes bring down the cost and make the roads more durable. A 1km stretch of road was built in Kalyani using this method, he says.         
	Talks are on for a tie-up with three municipalities for similar units. Joyashree Roy, professor of economics at Jadavpur University and environment expert, carried out an economic survey for such a venture. Roy forwarded Chatterjees name to I Create, a foundation that promotes self-employment, which is now helping HC Plastic to raise funds.        
	Not so sweet         
	A traditional sweet shop was opening a branch in Salt Lake last Monday. To add a touch of glamour, an actress of some repute had been invited to stand beside the septuagenarian proprietor while he cut the ribbon.         
	The trays in the racks were being lined with naram and kada paak sweets as everyone waited for the inauguration.         
	So you like sweets? asked a guest, marvelling at the celebs shapely figure.         
	What a question to ask! the pretty face broke into a smile. Puzzled, the guest asked: Does that mean yes or no? Of course yes, I love sweets. Pleased, the guest with a sweet tooth pressed further: So, which are your favourite sweets? The actress though long and hard and replied: Naam to ektao mone porchhe na. Dekhle boltey parbo (I cannot remember any name. I can tell when I see them).         
	That is not how a mishti aficionado behaves. Though such ignorance benefits shapely figures.

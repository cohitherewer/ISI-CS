The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sops to speed up vehicle conversion
                                                                                                               Sops to speed up vehicle conversion
          OUR BUREAU                          The government has announced a partial waiver of the penalty on tax dues of registered autos. A Telegraph picture                                  
	The government is trying to speed up the replacement of old commercial vehicles and conversion of two-stroke autos to LPG by offering sops to the operators after failing to crack down on those violating the high court ban.         
	Transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury met operators on Tuesday and promised to remove roadblocks in the conversion process. He is scheduled to meet banks and oil companies soon for this purpose.        
	Citu leader Subhash Mukherjee, who was present at the meeting, said the operators demanded more LPG stations in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area and speedy processing of sanctioned applications by banks. Chowdhury promised prompt action on our demands, Mukherjee said.        
	For autos, Chowdhury announced a partial waiver of penalty for default on payment of taxes. All registered autos would have to pay their tax dues before applying for conversion. The penalty, which amounts to Rs 20,000-30,000 in most cases, has been fixed at Rs 2,500, the transport secretary said at Writers Buildings in the afternoon.        
	Auto operators appeared pleased with the waiver. The gesture is welcome. The number of applications for conversion should go up now, said a senior Citu leader.        
	Chowdhury announced that out of the 128 applications for new 40-seat buses, 51 had been sanctioned. He also said that 630 new buses had been sanctioned under the Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Rural Renewal Mission (JNNURM) by the Centre. At least 100 new buses bought under the central scheme should hit the streets by August-end, he said.        
	The public vehicles department (PVD) has, meanwhile, received only 1,200 applications from owners of two-stroke autos registered after August 1, 2000, for conversion to LPG, which the state okayed 11 days ago.         
	Nearly 10,000 autos were registered after August 1, 2000. Most owners appear disinterested to switch, said a PVD official.        
	PVD is also awaiting an official word from the government for processing the applications received. It seems the government is playing it safe as the decision to allow the switch did not have the high courts approval, he added.

  - Dark horse scare for T20 winners           JHINUK MAZUMDAR                              A batsman from The Aryans School team. Picture by Anindya Shankar Ray              
	National High School for Boys defeated The Aryans School to win the Victo Inter School T20 Cricket Tournament, held in association with The Telegraph in Schools (TTIS). National High School set a target of 167 and won by 15 runs.         
	The dark horse of the tournament, The Aryans School, gave a tough fight in their debut outing, in the finals held at the East Calcutta District Sports Council ground in Kankurgachhi on Friday.         
	We were able to notch up 166, as their fielding slackened in the slog overs, said Krishnayan Chatterjee, the captain of National High, who was also selected the man of the match. The Aryans started well and were 48 for no loss at the end of six overs. The match slipped out of their hands when they started losing wickets quickly.         
	The games leading to the final were more about correcting the mistakes made in the qualifying matches. Krishnayan attributed his teams success in the finals to regular practice. Even in the scorching summer heat, we practised for at least six hours every day, he said.         
	National High was the favourite. The team has been performing consistently for the past few years. They won the Inter-School Cricket Tournament, organised by the Cricket Association of Bengal, from 2001 to 2005 and in 2007. They won the Inter-School Cricket Tournament, organised by the District School Sports Association, South Calcutta, since 2004, except in 2009.         
	The Aryans  the school was founded in 2005  was a surprise package. They defeated St James and Saifee Hall to reach the finals. Faced with such strong teams, we took each match as it came, said Ahmad Nadim, the coordinator of The Aryans School.         
	The captain of the Aryans, Rishav Singh, was unhappy to settle for the runners-up trophy. The batsmen played well, but our fielding and bowling was not up to the mark. We also gave away too many runs, he said.

                                                                                                               Help suspect in highrise theft
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The building where the Khetwars live. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                   
	A domestic help who had jumped bail in a theft case allegedly cleaned out a businessmans flat on Camac Street while the family was visiting a temple on Sunday evening.         
	According to police, the youth, recruited a fortnight ago as a replacement for the regular help who had gone on a vacation, stole Rs 9 lakh and valuables worth Rs 1.5 lakh from Bimal Khetwars flat.         
	He, along with his wife and daughter, returned from the temple around 8.30pm to find the main door of the second-floor flat bolted and the wardrobes where the cash and ornaments were kept open. The help was missing.        
	On hearing a description of the youth, who had identified himself as Kapil, the sleuths suspected that he was actually Ram Prasad Gupta, who had been arrested in connection with a similar theft in 2007.        
	When we showed a photograph of Gupta from our archive to the family members, they identified him as their help, said detective chief Jawed Shamim.        
	The security guard of the building said he had not noticed Kapil leaving the premises.         
	Khetwar told the police that he had hired the youth on the recommendation of a former help called Pandit who had served the family for 30 years before becoming a priest.         
	Pandit told us that Kapil had approached him a few months ago for a job and was in touch with him. According to Pandit, he had merely asked Kapil to meet the Khetwar family. Pandit is not on our list of suspects, said Shamim.        
	An investigator said the family did not provide Shakespeare Sarani police station the particulars of their domestic help after recruiting him.

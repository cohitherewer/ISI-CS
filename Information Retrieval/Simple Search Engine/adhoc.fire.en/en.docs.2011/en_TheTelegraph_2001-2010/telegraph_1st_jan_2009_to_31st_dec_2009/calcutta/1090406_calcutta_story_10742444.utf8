The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Memory malady in young
                                                                                                               Memory malady in young
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Memory loss is no more a disease of the aged. An increasing number of younger people are suffering from it too, according to doctors.        
	Even people in their early-40s develop vascular dementia, which is caused by cerebral haemorrhage, said Trishit Roy, a city-based neurologist, at an awareness programme on ageing and dementia organised by the Rotary Club of Greater Calcutta recently.        
	Stress coupled with sedentary lifestyle is responsible for the disease afflicting the young. Alzheimers Disease is the principal cause of dementia among those above 60.        
	Bangur Institute of Neurosciences, under the aegis of the Indian Council of Medical Research, is conducting a study on the spread of vascular dementia among the younger population in the city and its causes.        
	According to doctors, vascular dementia is caused by hypertension, arteriosclerosis and some unknown reasons. Controlling blood pressure and diabetes and exercise can prevent the disease.        
	Avoiding fast food and smoking also helps, a doctor said.

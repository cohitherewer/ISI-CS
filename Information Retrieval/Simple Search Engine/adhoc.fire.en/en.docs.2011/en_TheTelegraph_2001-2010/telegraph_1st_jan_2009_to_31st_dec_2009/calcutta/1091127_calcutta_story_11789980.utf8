The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | D for digital, F for footfall
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      D for digital, F for footfall
          PRIYANKA ROY                          De Dana Dan will be the widest Bollywood release in Bengal, hitting 125 screens on Friday                                  
	Akshay Kumar has gone digital to beat the Khans in the numbers game  in the first-day-first-show screen count.        
	Priyadarshans De Dana Dan, starring Akshay and Katrina Kaif, will be the widest Bollywood release in Bengal, hitting 125 screens on Friday.        
	All thanks to digital technology  screening digitised films downloaded through satellite (UFO) or transported in portable hard disks (Qube)  as opposed to the traditional method of screening through physical prints.        
	Of the 125 screens, 70 are screening it through Qube, including cinemas in Bankura and Contai, says Vishnu Mohta of Shri Venkatesh Films, the eastern India distributors of De Dana Dan.        
	The switch from print to digital has ensured a far wider release for Bollywood and even Tollywood. Even a film like Prem Amar was shown at 100 screens. For Bollywood films, digital download has ensured that Tier 2 and Tier 3 theatres dont have to wait for weeks for the prints to be passed down from Tier 1 theatres, says Mahendra Soni of Shri Venkatesh Films.        
	V Digital, an associate of the Calcutta-based distribution and production company, has already equipped 140 theatres in Bengal with Qube technology, some even in remote villages, and the number is growing steadily.        
	Cost-effectiveness, of course, is the key to the spread of digital screening. Exhibitors have to pay Rs 200-250 per show as opposed to shelling out the Rs 50,000-60,000 cost of print.        
	Some standalone cinemas have got a lease of life after going digital. Freed of the pressure of running a stipulated number of shows to recover the print cost, single screens can run multiple films in different time slots.        
	A standalone cinema can now operate like a multiplex, offering a wider bouquet of films to patrons, says exhibitor-distributor Arijit Dutta who has opted for digital screenings at both Priya and Star Theatre.        
	Besides being cost effective, beaming a film through Qube or UFO minimises damage to print and cuts down on transportation time and cost, adds Debashish De of Paradise and Roxy, which went digital in 2004.        
	Multiplexes too are going digital, with INOX Rajarhat running primarily on the tech tool, while INOX Swabhumi and the Fame plexes also screen films digitally. The quality of digital films is almost on a par with those beamed through platter and spool, says Virendra Marya of INOX.        
	But the plexes are not going all-digital as Hollywood films cannot be screened using this technology. Hollywood still hasnt given its nod because it does make one susceptible to piracy, says Dutta.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Held for Rs 83 lakh fraud
                                                                                                               Held for Rs 83 lakh fraud
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A former senior executive of a private insurance firm, Abhijit Talukdar, 40, was arrested in the city on Monday for allegedly duping two persons of around Rs 83 lakh.        
	The victims  friends, aged 71 and 64  had bought several unit-linked insurance policies two years ago from the firm where Talukdar worked as additional chief branch manager, said detective chief Damayanti Sen.        
	Talukdar talked the duo  a retired engineer and an ex-merchant navy captain  into authorising him to operate their bank accounts. In September, Talukdar allegedly transferred funds from their accounts in his name and resigned from service, said an officer.         
	The fraud came to light when one of the complainants realised Rs 48 lakh was missing from his account. He alerted his friend, who found Rs 35 lakh had been withdrawn from his account too.        
	After learning that Talukdar had resigned, the duo lodged a complaint with Lake Town police on September 15. The cops raided Talukdars flat in Lake Gardens the next day, but he had fled by then.         
	We traced him by tracking his cellphone call details, said an officer.

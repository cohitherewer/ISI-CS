The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Double trouble at Minerva 
                                                                                                               Double trouble at Minerva 
										      STAGE                        
	Minerva will now host not one but two theatre schools and two repertoire companies to boot! Upsetting all plans for a performance-oriented training centre covering all aspects of theatre drawn up by the new committee of the Minerva Natya Sanskriti Charcha Kendra, the state has allotted the same venue to the National School of Drama (NSD) for a regional branch. The question is, will the Minerva be big enough for both?         
	State director of culture Anup Motilal feels there can be no reason why the two cant coexist. The NSD is ready too.         
	Speaking to Metro from Delhi, NSD director Anuradha Kapoor said: Minerva has been allotted to us, we have a letter from the chief ministers office. We are now going to see the premises. For the syllabus more discussions are necessary but there will be both training and performances. Once we meet the principal secretary of the department of information and culture, Dilip Chakraborty, on March 16 at Writers Buildings, we can decide how we can help the theatre movement in Bengal.         
	She said that since the NSD often works in other auditoriums in Delhi there is no scope for a clash. There are bound to be gaps, days when we dont have a show, the auditorium can then be utilised by the Minerva Repertoire.        
	But director and playwright Chandan Sen, also a member of the Minerva committee, feels that the NSD usually works on a far larger scale and if the plans of the Minerva committee were put into action, all the small spaces inside Minerva and the auditorium would be needed 24X7.        
	In Bangalore the NSD Southern Wing opened on February 18, the Karnataka government having handed over the entire Guru Nanak complex in Vasanth Nagar, including an auditorium, to the organisation. More land will be allotted three years later, said Samik Bandyopadyay, the vice-chairman of NSD.         
	In Calcutta, however, there seems to be just the Minerva or the incomplete Rawdon Square on the government list.       SEBANTI SARKAR

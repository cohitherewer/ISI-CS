The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Court prod for sibling right to govt job
                                                                                                               Court prod for sibling right to govt job
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta High Court gave sibling power a boost on Thursday when it instructed the state government to take steps to allow dependent brothers and sisters of employees who die in harness to get jobs on compassionate grounds.        
	According to the existing rule, only the widow and children of the deceased have the right to government jobs on compassionate grounds.        
	The rule will have to be amended in order to allow siblings a similar right.        
	The order was passed by Justice Indira Banerjee, who also observed that unemployed brothers and sisters can also be dependent on a government employee.        
	Why will they not be provided jobs on compassionate grounds if the only earning members of their family dies in harness? she asked.        
	About two years ago, another judge of the same court, Justice P.K. Roy, had observed that in case the widow of a person who died in harness was not in a position to work, then her married daughter could be offered the job in case she was the only person the employees bereaved family member could depend on.        
	Thursdays order was granted on a petition by Soma Dey, a resident of Howrah.        
	Somas elder brother, Chittaranjan Dey, died in 1981 while serving as the head master in a state-aided school, Howrah Jatiya Prathamik Vidyalaya.        
	Chittaranjan Dey, 35, was unmarried and his sister, a 25-year-old spinster then, was dependent on his income. After her brothers death, Soma had applied for a job in any state-aided school on compassionate grounds.        
	Soma wrote to the primary education department praying for a job so that she could sustain herself. But the senior official told her that there was no provision for appointing sisters or brothers of government employees dying in harness, recounted Narayan Mondal and others appearing for Soma in high court.        
	The lawyer told Justice Banerjee: The district inspector of schools, Howrah, had been considering the issue sympathetically. He made many representations before the secretary and the minister of state for primary education requesting them to change the existing rule. But the state is still sitting on the issue.        
	Soma might get a job if the law is amended, but time is ticking away as she is 53 years old now.        
	If the process for amending the law takes more than seven years, our client will not get any benefit, but many other dependent brothers and sisters will surely be benefited if their siblings die while still employed with the government, said Mondal.

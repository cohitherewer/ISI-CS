           Storm in a coffee cup: Apropos Old world in new look (February 10), it was thrilling to learn that the historic Indian Coffee House on College Street is being renovated. Once Coffee House was an ideal rendezvous of intellectuals, students and artists. But of late, it is frequented by troublemakers and idlers. I hope the past glory of Coffee House is restored.

	Metro should be congratulated for highlighting the unenviable position that unaided non-government schools find themselves in because of the pre-election generous hike in salaries announced by the state government (Fee hike alert for private schools, March 5). I would like to add a few points to the report.           
	First, the hike was about 32 per cent on January 1, 2006, the notional date of implementation. On April 1, 2009, the date from which all private schools will be affected, the hike will be about 50 per cent on an average, taking into account subsequent annual increments in basic pay, additional instalments of DA granted, etc.           
	Second, this hike covers both teaching and non-teaching staff.           
	Third, the only way unaided schools can meet the sudden hike is by increasing fees. But the education department has laid down that fees cannot be increased without its permission. This permission, if granted at all, will take anything from six months to a year to obtain. So, the only option left for private schools is to introduce new categories of fees.           
	Fourth, this increase will be determined by the number of pupils a school has in each section of a class. A school that has 75 pupils in a section can make ends meet by increasing fees by Rs 200 per month per head. A school that has only 30 pupils per section must increase fees by about Rs 750-Rs 800 per month.           
	Fifth, the government has implemented Rules of Pay and Allowance 2009 with retrospective effect and undertaken to pay arrears. Private schools cannot do so simply because it is not possible to increase fees with retrospective effect.           
	Sixth, at present, the general financial condition of all companies, big and small, is none too healthy. Even large concerns are reducing salaries and increasing working hours. Asking guardians to pay an additional Rs 200-Rs 800 now is a choice that many schools do not want to exercise.           
	What then are these private schools to do? It is indeed strange that when Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee is advising companies to reduce salaries rather than retrench employees, pay commissions are being formed to hike salaries without any regard for the general economic situation.

	The report Cops run amok on train (February 11) mentions how two drunk constables misbehaved during the entire journey from Delhi to Calcutta. It is more shocking that the GRP at Mughalsarai refused to take down the complaint of passengers and passed the buck to their Howrah counterparts. The GRP at Mughalsarai should be punished for dereliction of duty. The railway minister should take note of such heinous incidents and make rail journey safe.             
	Govinda Bakshi,
  Budge Budge           
	 Cops are meant to maintain law and order. But two drunk constables  Kulwant Singh and Harjit Singh  did everything they are not supposed to. They urinated on passengers bags and even chased and abused women. An investigation must be conducted and the culprits punished severely.           
	Bhupen Bose, 
  Dum Dum Park           
	The behaviour of the two constables once again highlights the ugly face of the police department. It is ignominious that train passengers, especially women, are time and again being assaulted by the police. Some cops are not only enjoying privileges by misapplication of power; they are maligning the entire police department.           
	Strangely, our government has never dealt with errant cops stringently and the culprits usually roam scot-free. The authorities should look into the matter to avoid similar incidents in future.           
	Ratan Kumar Halder,

	Apropos the report TMC vs Citu with GMC as the winner, February 17, I would like to say: Congratulations, GMC (city police chief Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti), you have achieved the impossible! One hopes you and your team would repeat such a performance during mahamichhils led by various political parties at regular intervals. Also, Calcuttans would be ever so grateful if you could put a stop to blatant police extortion of hawkers, drivers, building contractors and others, thereby making the city a better place to live in.             
	A.S.Mehta,

	The foundation stone laying ceremony for Vivekananda flyover took place on February 18, 2009 (LRT, flyover flagged off, February 19). With the Lok Sabha elections coming up, I would like to point out that five years ago, just before the 2004 national polls, the foundation stone for the same project was laid by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. However, the project did not start and the foundation stone was removed before the 2006 Assembly elections.             
	Raj Bagri,

	It was shocking to learn that a 94-year-old patient, having broken her right femur, got traction on the left leg at SSKM Hospital (Traction for 94-yr-old in wrong leg, February 13). To err is human, but that cannot be an excuse in all cases, especially when it causes human suffering. The mistake could have been easily avoided if the case was handled with care. Also if the patient was conscious, she should have been asked to confirm which leg was in pain.             
	Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

	Things often become equally interesting and abominable when it relates to the administration in West Bengal under the Marxists. Some teachers who were supposed to impart value education to children were themselves found morally bankrupt. (Civic teachers to return Rs 2 crore, February 16). Out of a total of 546 civic school teachers, 300 were detected to have overdrawn their salaries fraudulently over the past 23 years. They enjoyed benefits of two pay scales illegally. What was most surprising was the silence of the drawing and disbursing authorities of the civic schools concerned. Such a fraud could not have been committed without a conspiracy between the tainted teachers and officials of the departments concerned, including the leaders of the Karmachari Sangha. Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyyas comments in this context were unfortunate. He accused only the teachers. Why do we then have a civic accounts department at the cost of tax-payers money?             
	Nishith Mitra,
  Malancha-Mahinagar           
	The guilty teachers and officials of the education department should be awarded exemplary punishment so that other teachers and government officials learn a lesson.           
	Sukumar Ghosh, 
  Mukundapur                   
	Many patients dont register complaints against faulty and shoddy treatment at Dr R Ahmed Dental College and Hospital as Diganta Sarkars father did (Dentist faces boy slap case, February 6). The behaviour of the staff in state-run hospitals is so painful that patients sometimes decide to stop their treatment. It is important for the states health department to learn why patients prefer to rush to other states for treatment.

                      An aesthetic search                    Six young painters from Calcutta and Bangladesh have come together to reflect common contemporary trends in art in the ongoing group art show. Though their works portray a wide variety of themes and moods, hues and colours, their aspiration is the same; a search for archetypal truths of life that lie beyond the tangible and the tactile. Their quest leads them on an endless journey through reality for the elements of form, trying to reach a visual metaphor that will hold what the mind says. In the process, they have to face what life offers, its events, hardships, opportunities and even chaos. Yet they manage to retain faith in life and love. The artists express their thoughts about art and aesthetics, time, self and identity, tradition and modernity though their art. In the process, they uphold one basic paradigm: that neither the artist nor can we do without art in life. Participants: Bishwajit Goswami, Maksuda Iqbal Nipa, Mallika Das Sutar (a painting by her appears here), Pradip Das, Raju Sarkar and Saswati Sengupta. Hosted by Art Trust.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Its an animal planet at pandals
                                                                                                               Its an animal planet at pandals
          SUDESHNA BANERJEE                            Bal Hanuman motifs made of noodles to be used by Poddarnagar Sarbojanin Durgotsab and (below) swimmer Rashmi Sharma, the brand ambassador of Chetla Agrani Club. Pictures by Sudeshna Banerjee and Amit Datta                                 
	The four-legged, feathered and the finned folk have emerged as the theme for many pujas across town.         
	A baby monkey will lord over the entrance of Poddarnagar Sarbojanin Durgotsab, off Anwar Shah Road. He is Bal Hanuman. His exploits would be displayed on panels around the pandal. The organisers have put up hoardings with the slogan Mondopey elei jivey jol. The mystery message hints at the material used for the panels  strands of noodles. The panels are being prepared at Pradip Mondals Kasba workshop.         
	Mondal chose the theme and material to please little pandal-hoppers. The themes of most pujas are beyond the comprehension of kids. Here they will find their cartoon hero.         
	The noodles are soaked in coloured water and dried before being used on the panels. The chalchitra and the goddesss ornaments will be made of noodles too. We have used 500kg till now, said Mondal.         
	Monkeys will dot trees and roofs of huts leading to the Shibmandir pandal on Lake Temple Road. While the simians are being made from banana skin and fibre, what they will clutch in their paws will be the real thing. We will change the bananas daily, promised general secretary Partho Ghosh. Banana trees would be planted on the sidewalks. This way the puja plans to live up to its promise Kola gachher kola dekhabo.         
	The art of making the models, including peacocks, owls and snake with snake charmer, is intricate. We have sourced 1,000 kg of banana skin from Assam and 300kg of banana fibre from Kanyakumari. In the south, layers of the banana stalk are scraped out, pressed in machines, made into yarn and woven into cloth, Ghosh said. The Devis sari and ornaments will be made of banana yarn.         
	Goddess Lakshmi will be pleased with the pandal of Hindusthan Park Sarbojanin. Her mount, the owl, is the theme here. The entrance carries a gigantic owl motif. Pyancha-i Durga, say the puja hoardings. Owls are an endangered species. They are also revered in cultures around the world. While we sleep, they eat insects that harm our crops, thereby acting as our protector. A parallel may be drawn with Ma Durga, who guards us even in the darkness of our ignorance, said treasurer Sutapa Das. Owls of various shapes, sizes and cultures will decorate the pandal and its approach.         
	Galloping horses greet visitors to the Vivekananda Sporting Club pandal in Haridevpur, near Tollygunge. The wheels of the sun gods horse-drawn chariot are the main motifs of the pandal structure while 3,000 horses of various sizes comprise the dcor.         
	Taking a dive underwater will be Chetla Agrani Club. We want to acquaint visitors with life in the deep to address the problems of sea pollution. Our inspiration is the Underwater World of Singapore, where marine creatures swim over visitors heads, said Ajoy Chatterjee of the club.         
	Clay figures of shark, octopus, seahorses and starfish will be placed amid corals and reeds in glass showcases in a tunnel leading to an open shell in which a miniature Durga will sit. Champion swimmer Rashmi Sharma is our brand ambassador, Chatterjee said.

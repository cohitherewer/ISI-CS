The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Metro tickets eye PCOs
                                                                                                               Metro tickets eye PCOs

	Metro passengers could soon be buying tickets or recharging multi-ride smart cards at the nearest post-office or PCO instead of queuing up in front of a station counter.        
	We plan to outsource a part of our ticketing operations to post-offices and select PCOs to reduce the queues in front of counters during peak hours. We are working out the details with officials of CRIS (Centre for Railway Information Systems), said V.N. Tripathi, the general manager of Metro Railway.        
	All network-dependent systems of the Indian Railways, including ticketing, are developed by CRIS.        
	The biggest challenge for the technical team is to make the ticketing machines tamper-proof.        
	System security is an issue we are looking at closely, and we need to be absolutely sure about that before outsourcing ticketing. We are considering only post-offices and PCOs to begin with to minimise the risk of forgery, Tripathi said.        
	Congestion at the booking counters is a problem at almost all Metro stations. Most passengers dont buy smart cards or multi-ride tickets, which is one of the reasons for the long queues.        
	Riya Chakraborty, a final-year MA student at Calcutta University, often takes the Metro from Kalighat to Central stations but does not carry a multi-ride ticket. On certain days, she misses a train because of the long queues in front of the counters.        
	At times, the queues reach the stairs at the entrance and yet only three counters are open, she complained.        
	Metro Rail officials said shortage of manpower was a perennial problem and that was why more counters could not be kept open through the day.        
	Metro now has 2,916 employees against 3,558 sanctioned posts. Another 109 people are being recruited in preparation for the extension of services to Garia.        
	But we need many more people, and the only alternative is to outsource ticketing, an official said.         
	Metro Railway is also planning to increase the frequency of trains. The gap between two trains during peak hours will be reduced to four minutes from six after the extended route becomes operational, said general manager Tripathi.        
	The signalling system needs to be overhauled before the frequency of trains is increased.        
	Sources said trains might start running till Birji station, near Garia, within a couple of months. The service was to start last year but has been postponed for various reasons.        
	Around four lakh passengers take the Metro every day. The figure might double once the extended route becomes operational, officials said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mike in class for throat relief
                                                                                                               Mike in class for throat relief
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta High Court on Tuesday directed the principal secretary of the school education department to consider the plea of Soma Sadhukhan, an assistant teacher of a state-aided school who wanted to use a public address system in class.        
	Sadhukhan is suffering from a throat ailment and has been advised by the medical board of NRS hospital to use a microphone while teaching. The authorities of Purba Putiari Gangapuri Shiksha Sadan, where Sadhukhan is the Bengali teacher, didnt accept her plea as there was no such law.        
	Passing the order, Justice Dipankar Dutta said that though there was no law allowing a schoolteacher to use a public address system in class, that didnt imply that it was barred.         
	The principal secretary is directed to consider the case of the petitioner (Sadhukhan) within 12 weeks and inform the school authorities concerned, the judge said.         
	He also directed the school to pay the petitioner her pending salary between September 18, 2002, and April 26, 2003, when she could not teach.        
	Sadhukhans lawyer L.K. Pal said his client was not in a position to take classes because of her throat ailment.         
	Following a school directive, she appeared before a medical board at NRS hospital on January 15, 2003. The board recommended that if Sadhukhan did not use a public address system, she would lose her voice forever.        
	Sadhukhan then requested the school to allow her to use a microphone. But the authorities refused. They also stopped her salary, Pal said. Sadhukhan moved the high court in September 2003 and Justice A.K. Mitra passed an interim order asking the school to allow her to use a microphone.         
	The authorities allowed her to join back but did not let her take classes. The school also moved court saying there was no law empowering a teacher to use a public address system in class. Sadhukhan filed another plea against the school. Both petitions came up for hearing on Tuesday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mamata plans station, tracks
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Mamata plans station, tracks
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Railway minister Mamata Banerjee on Sunday confirmed that the fourth passenger terminal in the city would come up at Majherhat and promised to improve Calcuttas transport network.        
	The alternative terminal at Majherhat has been sanctioned. The multi-functional complex will also come up there, Mamata said at a programme to inaugurate a computerised passenger reservation system at Thakurpukur on Sunday.         
	The plans are in their final stages and an extensive survey is going on. Work is expected to start soon, said a senior railway official.        
	The integrated terminal will be accessible through a host of roads, including one on top of a 300m-long single-span rail bridge over the Hooghly.        
	The bridge will link Majherhat with Sankrail in Howrah. Once the terminal is ready, several trains from western and southern India will be diverted to Majherhat from Sankrail, 17km from Howrah station.        
	It will take around two years to build the bridge, added the official.         
	The terminal and multi-functional complex will help Behala, Diamond Harbour, Bishnupur, Mahestala and adjoining areas to develop into an industrial zone, said Mamata.        
	According to railway officials, Mamata resurrected the project, which was shelved for years, after taking over as railway minister.        
	The railway is also planning elevated tracks from Majherhat to Joka.        
	There is a need to bring rail to this area. However, we dont want to acquire land or demolish buildings. If the state government gives us one metre of land beside the footpath, then the railway can build pillars for elevated tracks. Either circular rail or mono rail can be operated on the tracks, said the railway minister.        
	A railway official said the survey for the 8.75km stretch between Majherhat and Joka had been completed by Metro Railway and a proposal to build the elevated tracks at a cost of Rs 800 crore had been sent to the Railway Board for approval.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bengal lags behind in IIT test
                                                                                                               Bengal lags behind in IIT test
          CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE                                        
	Bengal has again lagged behind other states in cracking the joint entrance examination of the Indian institutes of Technology, the results of which were declared on Monday.        
	Figures released by the IITs show that the Kharagpur zone, under which Bengal falls, is far behind the Mumbai, Chennai and Delhi zones in terms of the number of students cracking the test.        
	The results showed that only 1.77 per cent of the candidates appearing from the Kharagpur zone were successful in getting through to the IITs, compared with 4.19 per cent from Mumbai, 3.74 from Chennai, 2.50 from Delhi and 1.86 from Rourkee.        
	A proper analysis is required to determine why lesser number of candidates are appearing in the exam and being able to crack it, said A.N. Samanta, the chairman of JEE, IIT Kharagpur.        
	Of the 38,4977 candidates who appeared in the IITJEE this year, 52,176 were from the IIT Kharagpur zone compared with 80,501 from Bombay, 60,852 from Delhi and 64,289 from Madras. Of the 10,035 successful candidates, only 9.24 per cent were from the Kharagpur zone.        
	Students blamed the poor performance on inadequacies of the board syllabi and migration.        
	According to Souvik Ganguly, a student of South Point High School, who secured an all India rank of 114, an upgrade of the syllabus of the state HS council would go a long way in closing the gap between the zones.        
	Students of the Bengal board have to work harder than their ISC and CBSE counterparts. It is one of the disadvantages of appearing in the IITJEE from the state, said Ganguly.        
	But the training centres feel the gap between the Bengal board and IITJEE syllabi has been bridged to a great extent over the past few years.        
	Many IIT aspirants migrate from West Bengal to places like Kota in Rajasthan or Delhi and Mumbai in an attempt to have a surer shot at cracking IITJEE, said a teacher who coaches students for the exam.

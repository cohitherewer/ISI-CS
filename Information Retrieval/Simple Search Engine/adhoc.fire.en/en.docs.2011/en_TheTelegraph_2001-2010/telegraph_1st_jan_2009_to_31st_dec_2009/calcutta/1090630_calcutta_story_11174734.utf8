The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Teen molested during X-ray
                                                                                                               Teen molested during X-ray
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	An X-ray technician allegedly molested an 18-year-old patient at TL Jaiswal Hospital in Howrah on Monday afternoon.        
	Suman Ray, 32, took flight after Tapasi Das, a homemaker, lodged a complaint against him with Malipanchghara police station.        
	Tapasi, a resident of Sri Ram Dhang Road in Salkia, was taken to the hospital by her father Subal Das after she complained of chest pain. The doctor on duty in the emergency department examined her and asked her to get a chest X-ray done.        
	Subal said: I wanted to accompany my daughter to the X-ray room but the technician asked me to wait outside. Tapasi emerged from the room after nearly an hour and started crying.        
	Subal and Tapasi first lodged a complaint with hospital superintendent Swapan Kumar Hari and then with the police station.         
	Hari said: The district health department has formed a five-member committee to probe the incident. Action will be taken against the accused if the allegation is found to be true.        
	Supporters of the Trinamul Congress demonstrated at the gate of the hospital demanding immediate arrest of the technician.        
	Sudip Ghosh, the president of the Trinamul Youth Congress, said: We shall demonstrate again tomorrow if the accused is not arrested by then. A section of employees, owing allegiance to the CPM-affiliated Co-ordination Committee, is trying to shield the him.

(Bishwarup Dutta)                                      
	A mother who gifted her lifes savings to her son to start a business and a wife who stood by her husband for four decades has moved court against both for leaving her to fend for herself.        
	Saiba Rani Giri, 55, has been working as a domestic help in Thakurpukur since husband Narendra Nath, 70, walked out on her along with their son Tarak and his wife earlier this year.         
	I feel embarrassed going from house to house to work in the very locality where I lived for 33 years as a homemaker, she told Metro on Wednesday after an Alipore court issued summons to her husband and son.        
	Saiba Rani had filed a complaint with Thakurpukur police station in February accusing Tarak of threatening to kill her. The FIR said the 35-year-old, who works in a printing press and runs a car-on-hire business, and his wife would regularly harass her with Narendra Naths silent consent.        
	The trio moved out of their home after a police team came calling to warn them against harassing Saiba Rani.        
	They first tried to drive me out of the house. My son and daughter-in-law would shred my clothes, throw my utensils out and scold me for trivial reasons. There was a period when I would leave home at dawn and return after 10pm just to avoid them. I had no choice but to lodge a police complaint when my son threatened to kill me, she said.        
	Her petition will be heard by the chief judicial magistrate of Alipore, Apurba Sinha Roy, on August 25.        
	Saiba Rani hopes the court would take into account everything I did for my family before giving its ruling.        
	 I used to stitch clothes at home to supplement the family income and save some money. I gave the amount that I had collected over the years to Tarak to buy the second-hand Ambassador that he now hires out, she said.        
	According to the petition, Taraks monthly income is around Rs 35,000 and Narendra, a retired printing press employee, earns interest from a fixed deposit.

	According to the petition, Taraks monthly income is around Rs 35,000 and Narendra, a retired printing press employee, earns interest from a fixed deposit.              
	Saiba Ranis two daughters, both married, often visit their mother but are unable to offer monetary help.         
	The elder of the two, Pinku Chakraborty, said she had tried telling her brother not to torment their mother but he wouldnt listen. He has even changed his cellphone number to distance himself from us.        
	Pinku said Taraks behaviour towards their mother changed after their father gifted him the four-cottah plot on which the house stands. He began to care only for my father after that and look for ways to drive out my mother because his wife couldnt stand her.        
	Saiba Ranis counsel Dipit Bose said his client had petitioned the court to order her husband and son to pay her Rs 10,000 a month each. The petition has been filed under Section 125 of the CrPC, which pertains to maintenance of wives, children and parents.

          ARKA DAS                          Aparna Sen admires Raja Mohan Dass work at CIMA Gallery. Picture by Aranya Sen                                  
	For most, sensory perceptions and expressions through them are a given. But what happens when you are born with a debilitating, irreversible condition where one of the perceptions is non-existent, and yet, there is an immense desire for expression?        
	A look at 16-year-old Raja Mohan Dass paintings would offer some answers, and some very creative ones at that.        
	Explosions in colours and emotions, all of Rajas works were sold out at the Art Mela at CIMA Gallery.        
	The youngest artist to be showcased at the workshop-exhibition alongside some of the biggest names in contemporary art, Raja suffers from a congenital hearing disability.         
	Clad in a short, smart shirt, a bandana around his forehead, stylish bands around the wrists and a pair of low-waist jeans  and now quite the celebrity resident at Shuktara, the Kudghat-based home for children with disabilities  Raja is like any teenager with his passion for football, hip-hop music, dance moves and superbikes.        
	The mezzanine floor room at Shuktara, which Raja shares with a few other youngsters, is neatly lined with several paintings, while sketches by Raja and his friends at the home hang on wires across the length of the walls  characters from the Animax channel, detailed models of racing bikes, even the ubiquitous sunset. Several of the framed works are by artist Samir Roy, a patron and trustee of the organisation and Rajas mentor.         
	Raja came to Shuktara about four years back. He doesnt have any memory of his roots or where he hails from, but the sketches have always been a part of his daily life. His three main interests are racing, animation channels and dance, smiles Nagendra Kumar Mishra, the chairman of Shuktara.        
	Noticing his interest, Mishra took Raja along to visit exhibitions in various galleries of the city. That was what probably egged him on to try and start painting.        
	From colour pencil and pen-and-ink sketches of animation characters, the hobby turned into a serious passion. Raja started dabbling with watercolour, charcoal and acrylic. Soon, he chose to create larger mixed-media works. Over the past few months and especially for the CIMA fair, he produced full-fledged mixed-media paintings, often using sand that he custom colours to use in his works.        
	What was it like being a part of the CIMA Mela? Rajas face lights up with a broad smile, as he says it with a thumbs-up.        
	Any favourites? Suvaprasannas works, he nods. (Raja also loves Paritosh Sens art; the late master had visited Shuktara.) And then there was the massive spread of trinkets to choose from at the store within the gallery that got the teenager hooked.        
	With his frank smile and affable personality, there is no problem communicating with the fan of Samba soccer who also admires Bhaichung.        
	Come January 2010, Shuktara will organise its annual event where Raja will choreograph a group of his friends at the home to shake a leg to 50 Cents music, not to mention show off his own dance moves. The event will also showcase Rajas art and a number of paintings by the children he has inspired to take up sketching at the home.         
	So what does Raja want to do? Keep painting.

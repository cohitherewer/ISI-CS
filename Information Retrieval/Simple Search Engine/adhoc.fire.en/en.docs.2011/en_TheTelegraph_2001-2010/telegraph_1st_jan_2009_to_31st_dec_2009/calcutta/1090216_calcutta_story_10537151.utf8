The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Crackdown on traffic rule violators 
                                                                                                               Crackdown on traffic rule violators 
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Police have vowed to crack the whip on traffic rule violators from Monday.        
	The cops have been asked to collect spot fines from violators  such as jaywalkers, people riding two-wheelers without helmets and reckless drivers.        
	The drive will continue from 9am till late at night, said a senior officer in the traffic department.        
	The idea is to enforce traffic discipline on errant motorists and pedestrians who think they can get away with violations. We often come across instances of cars being parked in no-paring zones and buses violating signals during rush hours, the officer added.        
	The January figures reveal that the worst offenders on the city roads are private buses, followed by minibuses and two-wheelers. Parking vehicles in no-parking zones tops the list of violation, followed by jumping signals and rash driving. Last month, around 18,500 cases had been lodged against private buses, 725 against state buses and more than 8,500 cases against minibuses.        
	The police said that among the most accident-prone areas are Chitpore and Amherst Street in the north, Hare Street and Jorasanko in the central and Hastings in the south. Keeping this in mind, the officers of the Shyambazar, Headquarters and South Traffic Guards  which cover these zones  have been asked to be extra alert. The Beleghata Traffic Guard, covering the EM Bypass, has been asked to deploy all its men, the officer said.        
	The police are also planning to install two hidden cameras on the AJC Bose Road flyover which will function round-the-clock.        
	The high-speed corridors that will come under the scanner include the Bypass, BT Road, Red Road and the AJC Bose Road flyover.        
	To rein in the bike gangs which hit the streets even late at night the cops have decided to be strict with riders who do not wear helmets.

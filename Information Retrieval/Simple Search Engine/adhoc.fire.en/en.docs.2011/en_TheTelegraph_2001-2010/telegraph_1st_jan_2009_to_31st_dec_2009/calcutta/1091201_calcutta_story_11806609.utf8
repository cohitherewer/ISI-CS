The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Ghats or litter dumps?
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Ghats or litter dumps?
          ONTHESPOT - BAGBAZAR NIMTALA GHATS                                    Sordid sight: Bagbazar (top) and Nimtala ghats. Pictures by Bishwarup Dutta                                  
	A deadlock between the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and Calcutta Port Trust (CPT)  on who should clean the immersion ghats on Strand Bank Road  is taking a huge toll on the riverfront.        
	More than a month has passed since the immersion of Jagaddhatri idols (October 28) but the Bagbazar and Nimtala ghats are still littered with hay-and-clay structures. Several bamboo frames tossed into the river are now stuck in the slushy bank. Rotten flowers, leaves and pots add to the litter.         
	While the CMC and the CPT are locked in a war of words, the pollution control board holds the port trust guilty of neglecting its duties and letting the riverfront turn into an eyesore.              
	What the CMC says:         
	Though the land belongs to the CPT, we clean the litter between Durga puja and Jagaddhatri puja. According to a Calcutta High Court order, the civic body is supposed to clean up the ghats and the CPT is supposed to bear 50 per cent of the cost. The CPT refused to pay the amount and filed a case against the order, said Faiyaz Ahmad Khan, member, mayor in council, information and public relation.        
	But we try and keep the banks clean.... Removing bamboo structures from the river is not our responsibility as we dont have trained divers. But we try and do so by hiring people. Sometimes local residents ask us to leave the structures, which they collect and recycle, he added.               
	What the CPT says:         
	The permission for immersion is granted by the civic body, so naturally it is their responsibility to clear the post-puja litter. Our primary role is to conserve the river for navigational purposes. Our role doesnt include looking into environmental hazards. So we filed for a stay on the high court order. We will abide by whatever the court says, said a CPT officer.                 
	What the PCB says:         
	The port trust has a statutory responsibility, but it is shirking its duty of maintaining the wholesomeness of the river. The port trust has no riverfront beautification project and its is extremely reluctant to do its bit for the Hooghly. We have sent several directives to the CPT for keeping the river bank clean and removing garbage, but it has not taken any action in this regard.         
	A year ago, we had submitted a report to the high court stating that the CPT was not interested in keeping the river clean, said Biswajit Mukherjee, the chief law officer of PCB and the member-convener of the high court committee on Ganga pollution.

           Bird brain: A water body at Alipore zoo covered in weeds and moss. A Telegraph picture                             
	Apropos the report Protest shield for killer drivers, March 25, it is a matter of grave concern to learn that the state administration was forced to bow before Citu-backed bus operators regarding its decision to charge killer drivers with Section 304 IPC (life imprisonment), which is non-bailable.           
	Now, police can only impose Section 304A on rogue drivers, which is bailable and the jail term is also not more than two years.           
	This kind of strong-arm behaviour of the Citu is certain to demoralise police personnel about exercising their duty freely. If the Citu can have a say in the performance of the state administration  particularly whom to book and how to book  then that day is not far away when they may stretch their power to the judiciary and dictate how to deal with cases and even frame their very own laws!           
	The governments volte face prompts the question: is our state administration a puppet in the hands of the Citu?           
	Sukumar Ghosh,
  Mukundapur                       
	Thanks to Metro for highlighting the poor upkeep of the once-famous Alipore zoo Upkeep lack in eyesore zoo, March 31. Unfortunately, the state government messes up whatever it handles, be it Salt Lake stadium, Curzon Park or the Howrah maidan, to name just a few. In the larger interest, all these public places, including the zoo, should be privatised and handed over to dependable agencies for running them. This would certainly ensure better upkeep.             
	A.S. Mehta,
  New Alipore           
	Children visit Alipore zoo with their parents or teachers to get a first-hand knowledge of animals, birds and reptiles. Seeing them in their natural habitat thrills kids and adults alike. It is thus very disheartening that Alipore zoo is in a miserable condition.           
	The water bodies and moats are filled with plastic bags, old newspapers, empty water bottles and biscuit wrappers. The zoo  Indias oldest and Calcuttas pride  must be kept neat, clean and pleasant.           
	Bhupen Bose, 
  Dum Dum Park           
	It is very unfortunate that the water bodies at the Alipore Zoological Gardens are in such a mess. The pictures published with the report clearly show plastic water bottles floating in ponds and moats. This not only pollutes the water but also makes it dangerous for the animals visiting the water bodies.           
	The zoo authorities should be more careful about keeping the water bodies clean. At the same time, visitors should not leave behind used items like water bottles and wrappers.           
	Sourish Misra,
  Salt Lake           
	The present condition of the zoo reflects poorly on the attitude of the authorities in maintaining this popular spot.           
	No amount of excuses offered by the officials can cover their lackadaisical attitude. The Alipore zoo is an integral part of Calcuttas rich heritage, which is being systematically destroyed. More importantly, the greenery stands starkly exposed to environmental pollution. The authorities alone are not to blame for this. Visitors display an extreme lack of civic sense when they litter the zoo premises shamelessly. Its time the authorities worked on a war footing to save the zoo. The need of the hour is proper upkeep and strict superintendence to prevent visitors from turning predators.           
	P.B. Saha, 
  Salt Lake             
	It is shocking that a widow had to run from pillar to post for nearly three decades to get her family pension (Pension relief for 80-yr-old after 28 yrs, March 27). Proper compensation should be offered to Gayatri Goswami, wife of late teacher Rajendra Mohan, and the officials responsible for her suffering should be penalised. Metro has repeatedly highlighted the misery of teachers who have been deprived either of their proper salary or pension. The government boasts about the hike in the pay scale of school employees. But neither the education department nor the finance department shows any interest in the disbursement of payment to the teachers.             
	Slackness in every state department has worsened the situation.           
	Ratan Kumar Halder,
  Behala                   
	Apropos Civic list to preserve ponds, it is quite intriguing that the Calcutta Municipal Corporation has finally decided to preserve water bodies after allowing more than 50,000 buildings to come up by filling up ponds. It is all the more shocking that chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has repeatedly said at seminars that water bodies will be preserved at any cost.             
	But all laws and norms were broken under the shield of political interference. Now only around 3,000 ponds are left out of 10,000 in the CMC area. One is reminded of the proverb: to lock the stable when the horse is stolen.           
	Govinda Bakshi, 
  Budge Budge                   
	The photograph and report of a 400kg Bombay bekti was fascinating (The city diary, March 27). Fish delicacies are an intrinsic part of Bengali life, but the rising price of fish is leaving a bitter taste in the mouth for most Bengalis.             
	P. Agarwala,
  Majdia, Nadia             
	It is heartening that the state environment department has brought an injunction on vessels polluting waterways (Bar on polluting vessels after prod, March 26).             
	The move should have been adopted much earlier.           
	Earlier, the authorities were busy resisting immersion of idols, dumping of waste from riverside jute mills and eateries to combat river pollution. No one thought of checking the use of harmful chemicals, oil and grease in the vessels.           
	It is ludicrous that such pollution occurs despite crores being spent under the Ganga Action Plan to keep the river clean. The failure of the Calcutta Port Trust to keep a tab on vessels on the river is disgraceful.           
	R.K. Halder,
  Behala             
	Kudos to actor Brian Cox for his comment that his sensibilities are geared more towards Bengali cinema than preposterous Bollywood fare (From Troy to town, on jute trail; Scottish actor shoots documentary, April 6). Bengalis, who are indifferent to their own cultural and cinematic tradition and have lost their identity in the deluge of Bollywood films, should learn a lesson from Cox.

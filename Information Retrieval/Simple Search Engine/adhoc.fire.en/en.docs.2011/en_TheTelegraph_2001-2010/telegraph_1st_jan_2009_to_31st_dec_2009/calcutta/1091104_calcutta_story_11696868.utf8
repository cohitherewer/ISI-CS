                      Saga of a singer                    When Calcutta became the capital of British India, the city underwent a significant change in its culture and lifestyle. As the cradle of the newly-emerging national bourgeoisie, it became the epicentre of music, dance and the fine arts with all aspiring artistes of the time descending upon the city in search of good patronage for their art. It was during this period, in 1883, that Badi Malkajan came to Calcutta with her 10-year-old daughter Gauharjan. With a fine singing voice, an innate sense of artistry and through rigorous training from famous maestros, she soon became one of the best singers in the city. One of the pioneer singers to record her voice on gramophone discs, her popularity knew no bounds. She earned the title, Jaan-e-Kalkatta, and became rich and famous. Yet, she was betrayed by the men she most trusted and became nearly a pauper in fighting court battles to regain what she had lost. Finally, she left for Mysore and became its court singer and died there, broken-hearted. This evenings production by Paikpara Akhor focuses on Gauharjans efforts to maintain her dignity and practice her art in the male-dominated society of the early 20th century and serves as an inspiration to preserve and spread our vast and rich cultural heritage at a time when it is in danger of being almost forgotten.

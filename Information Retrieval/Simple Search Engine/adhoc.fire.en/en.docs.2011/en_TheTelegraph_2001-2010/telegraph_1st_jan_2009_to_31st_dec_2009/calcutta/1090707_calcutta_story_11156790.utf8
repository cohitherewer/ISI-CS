The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Airport road garbage paved
                                                                                                               Airport road garbage paved

	Small groups of labourers are collecting household refuse for a fee from buildings around VIP Road and dumping it on both sides of the airport artery.        
	Civic workers also collect garbage from the buildings but many residents are opting for the private operators since they come by at convenient times.         
	Senior police and civic officials claimed ignorance about the illegal garbage dumping, primarily on the 2km stretch from Kestopur to Teghoria.        
	We have noticed that garbage is piling up along VIP Road, though we cannot understand how, said Tapas Chatterjee, the chairman of Rajarhat-Gopalpur municipality.        
	Some officials of the municipalitys conservancy department, however, said over 100 people were part of the dumping racket.        
	Since the municipal workers collect garbage early in the morning, the late-risers prefer to avail themselves of the services of private garbage collectors, said a conservancy official.        
	Like the municipal workers, members of the racket collect garbage in handcarts but dump it by the side of VIP Road, instead of the municipal vats at Kestopur, Joramadir, Raghunathpur and Kaikhali.        
	We are paid Rs 20 to Rs 60 per day for clearing the garbage of eight flats. Those who work the night shift and hence rise late, generally contact us. We charge extra for collecting extra garbage, said Jasimuddin Mondal, who picks up garbage from several flats. As the vats are far away we dump the garbage beside the road so that we can make more trips.        
	Last week, the municipality erected a bamboo fence at Teghoria to prevent garbage dumping, said Chatterjee. But the practice continues at Narayantala, Baguiati, Joramandir and near Haldiram.        
	Illegal garbage dumping has already filled up a pond at Nazrul Park near Kestopur. A portion of a pond at Joramandir  the only one left beside VIP Road  is being filled up by garbage, said Jhantu Mukherjee, a member of a local residents body.        
	Residents also claimed that about 10 full-grown trees at Narayantala, Joramandir and other places have died because of garbage dumping. The garbage poisons the roots of trees, said an official of the Dum Dum Park forest beat.

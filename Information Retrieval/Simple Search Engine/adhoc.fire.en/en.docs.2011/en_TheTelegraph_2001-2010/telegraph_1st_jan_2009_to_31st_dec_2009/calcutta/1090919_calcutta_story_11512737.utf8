The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | The festive crown that cares   Crown of caring
                                                                                                               The festive crown that cares   Crown of caring
  - True Spirit 2009 picks 267 pujas for test of sense and sensibility          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	The movement, which goes by the name of CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja, is growing annually.        
	Wednesday evening marked the induction of yet another batch of pujas into the True Spirit fold. It is not a contest, it is a way of life, was the refrain.        
	Born in 2003 with 60 pujas, True Spirit Puja in its 2009 edition, held in association with Rupa, finds 267 pujas in the fray after screening thousands of applications for the awards steering the festivities in Calcutta and Howrah towards being more meaningful.        
	Forty-nine of those who were not part of True Spirit 2008 made it past the initial screening and reached Spring Club to be guided on how to make Puja 2009 safer and happier. Another screening took place on Thursday for the final list to be drawn up.        
	Dilip Samajpati of CESC took the True Spirit Puja applicants through what makes the awards different. Along with traffic management, toilet and first-aid facilities, crowd control is an important consideration. Emergency exits and generators are recommended. Lending a helping hand to the challenged also finds a special place in the True Spirit scheme of things. Organisers are urged to create ramps and make special provisions for the elderly.        
	There is more at stake this year with two new awards  Puja that Cares and True to Tradition  supported by The Bengal, an NGO that has joined the movement. One will encourage pujas displaying social commitment and the other upholding heritage.                                
	Among first-time pujas were big-ticket ones like Ajeya Sanghati, Haridevpur, and Jodhpur Park, and those with modest budgets like Palli Asar Sporting Club (near New Alipore), and Abasarika, Dhakuria. On the True Spirit platform, after all, fancy frills like bigger pandals and brighter lights fade before sensible and sensitive touches.        
	Abhijit Das, representing Howrah Saraswati Club, said: By joining this movement we want to make people around us aware of the need to make pujas more responsible. Selimpur Jagaran Club referred to the movement as an inspiration. Keyatala Pally Samity unveiled plans to re-green two boulevards on Southern Avenue affected by Cyclone Aila.        
	Take up good projects. True Spirit is there to help you along, assured Samajpati.

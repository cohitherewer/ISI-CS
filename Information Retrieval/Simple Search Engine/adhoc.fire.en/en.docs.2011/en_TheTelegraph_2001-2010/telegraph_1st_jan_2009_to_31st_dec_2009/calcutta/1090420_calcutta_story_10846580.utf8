The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Memories of a dark (K)night 
                                                                                                               Memories of a dark (K)night 
  - Eden then, city now          OUR BUREAU                           Headlights of vehicles illuminate a dark stretch of AJC Bose Road during the blackout on Sunday evening. (Pabitra Das)                                        
	Trust the atmosphere in Calcutta to be electric whenever the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) square off with the Deccan Chargers, at home or in faraway South Africa.        
	Eden Gardens on April 20 last year and almost the entire city this year  is this a jinx or just a coincidence? wondered T20 addict Sambit Sen, 24, as the city sunk into darkness on Sunday and braced for a sultry night without lights, fans, air-conditioners and cricket.        
	Shah Rukh Khans Sourav Ganguly-led team was floundering when the lights had gone off at the Eden on that April night; the Knights regrouped and scampered to victory when play resumed after 31 minutes.        
	There was, however, no light at the end of the tunnel for the city on Sunday. I dont remember the last time there was such an extended blackout in the city, an official of the power department said.        
	Although power was back in some localities by late evening  the blackout began around 4.45pm  most CESC-served areas were in darkness till late in the night.        
	For Debayan Ghosh, 12, that meant a cruel change of plan. My half-yearly exams start next week and I had been studying the whole day so that I could watch the first KKR match. Now I can neither study nor enjoy the match, the Bhowanipore boy said.        
	Geetanjali Sarkar, a homemaker from Salt Lake, was at Mani Square with her family when the lights went off. It was so dark inside that I felt scared. I had never seen something like this in a mall, she recalled.        
	The citys eating-out zone, Park Street, was unusually quiet for a Sunday night. Most bars and restaurants rationed their back-up power, keeping only a few lights, fans and air-conditioners on.        
	Shops downed shutters earlier than normal as word spread that the blackout was triggered by a breakdown of all four power-generation units of the CESC. There is no point in keeping the store open now. I am going home, said Irfan Ali of Leather Hut, on Theatre Road, after bringing the shutters down two hours in advance.        
	Streetlights on almost all thoroughfares in the city  Lenin Sarani, Beleghata Main Road, Park Street, Theatre Road and AJC Bose Road  were off for the major part of the evening.        
	Sirshendu Mukherjee, a businessman returning home, said he stumbled on a dark footpath and nearly fell while walking along Lenin Sarani.        
	Homemaker Basabi Ghosh spent most of the evening outside her Creek Row home with her two daughters for company. How could they (the CESC) reserve the longest blackout for the hottest day of the season? Our home is a furnace right now and there is not even a mild breeze outside. This is going to be a sleepless night for us, she whined.        
	In some areas, residents braced for a water shortage with the Calcutta Municipal Corporation unable to supply filtered water during the usual evening slot (4 to 7 pm). An official said over a million roadside taps and household ferrules ran dry on a day when the mercury touched the seasons highest  41.2 degrees Celsius.        
	Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya and municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay went into a huddle with officials and decided to create an emergency water supply slot (from 8 to 9pm).        
	Metro Rail services were stalled for six minutes and the automatic signalling system at Howrah and Sealdah stations didnt function till 5.30pm, causing train delays. The station remained almost dark till late in the night.        
	No flight was disrupted because power supply for the runway lights was maintained with the emergency back-up system at the airport. The domestic and international terminals were partially affected. We had to make do with emergency lights from 4.45 to 5.15pm, an airport official said.

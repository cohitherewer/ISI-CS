The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Dubai roadshow targets city tourists
                                                                                                               Dubai roadshow targets city tourists
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Indoor snow-skiing is an attraction in Dubai                                  
	Dubai is setting its sights on the Calcutta traveller after wooing Mumbaikars for 12 years.        
	The many attractions of the desert city were showcased by the department of tourism and commerce marketing of Dubai on Wednesday evening.        
	Our aim is to promote Dubai in other countries and facilitate travel. We have had an office in Mumbai for the past 12 years but this is the first time we have come to Calcutta, said Carl Vaz, the director of the Dubai representative office in India.         
	The department has organised a tourism roadshow with Calcutta as the first stop. The group will also visit Chennai, Bangalore and Mumbai.         
	Vaz said: Dubai offers quality tourism. There are good hotels, spas, amusement parks, golf courses and other attractions. Its a place where one can go snow-skiing in the morning, sand-skiing in the afternoon and water-skiing in the evening.         
	But with the global economy going haywire, will there be any takers? The Dubai government hopes its long-term plans will pay off.        
	We expect some visitors from Calcutta during the summer, Puja and Christmas breaks. We are also planning for 2010. Once the economy picks up and people start travelling more, we would already have marketed ourselves here. We have noticed that the Indian traveller is very resilient, Vaz added.         
	Representatives from Dubais immigration department, hospitality industry, amusement parks and travel agents participated in the meet. The stall showcasing Atlantis, a luxury hotel with a water park, dolphin bay and other attractions, drew many visitors.

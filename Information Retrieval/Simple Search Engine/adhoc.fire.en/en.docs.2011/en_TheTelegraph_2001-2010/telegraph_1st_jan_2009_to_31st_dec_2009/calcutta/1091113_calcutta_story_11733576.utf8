          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Parents demonstrated outside a Howrah school on Thursday to protest a mathematics teacher leaving 11 Class IX girls locked up in a classroom after school hours for not doing their homework.        
	The parents, who did not lodge a complaint with police, stopped the demonstration only after the managing committee of Shanpur Netaji Subhas Balika Vidyalaya promised action against the accused teacher.        
	According to parents, Mita Mandal asked the students to do the sums that had been assigned to them as homework, locked up the classroom around 4.15pm and left the school after handing over the key to a Group D employee, who too allegedly went out of the premises around 5.45pm.        
	Hearing the students cries, residents called up the school secretary. The headmistress returned to the school and unlocked the door. Parents had meanwhile contacted the police. Priyanka Das, one of the locked-up students, said: After the Group D employee left, we started feeling insecure. We were sitting in the dark classroom and being bitten by mosquitoes. We started shouting for help in fear.         
	I made a mistake by locking up the students and leaving, said Mandal.        
	Dibakar Foujder, the school secretary, said: A teacher can ask students to stay beyond school hours but she should also stay with them. He added the students were freed by 6pm and not at 6.30pm, as they claimed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Teen-death docs off rolls
                                                                                                               Teen-death docs off rolls
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	A fathers belief in justice was renewed on Tuesday with the West Bengal Medical Council striking off the names of two orthopaedic surgeons accused by him of medical negligence causing the death of his 17-year-old son Rajnis.        
	We have got justice at long last. The loss of our only son is irreparable but my wife and I are relieved that the doctors responsible for his death in 2003 have been punished, said Manoj Patel, a 45-year-old property consultant in Bhowanipore.        
	Rajnis, a promising cricketer, had collided with another fielder while attempting a catch during a match at Vivekananda Park on February 6, 2003.        
	He fractured his left shinbone and was admitted to SSKM Hospital, where he underwent five surgeries in four months. Though he was admitted under a senior doctor, Dilip Majumdar, the surgeries were allegedly conducted by post-graduate trainees.        
	Rajnis died on June 2, allegedly because of a series of botched-up operations.        
	Manoj Patel then lodged a complaint against Majumdar with the West Bengal Medical Council and also accused the resident medical officer Debabrata Banerjee of negligence for not being present during some of Rajniss surgeries.        
	After more than five years of investigation, the medical council found the two doctors guilty on Tuesday but went easy on the two accused post-graduate trainees.        
	The names of Dilip Majumdar and Debabrata Banerjee were struck off the councils registry on Tuesday as they were found guilty, said Dilip Kumar Ghosh, the registrar of West Bengal Medical Council.        
	According to council officials, the doctors can appeal for restoration of their registration after six months.        
	The council had earlier wanted to know from the defendants why Rajnis Patel had been operated upon in the emergency OT instead of where planned surgeries are conducted.        
	The chargesheet stated that the surgeries had been performed by junior surgeons under the supervision of their seniors and no step was taken when the haemorrhage from the wound spun out of control.         
	Though the two guilty doctors were not available for comment, their lawyer Dipit Bose said there was no truth in the allegations and they would appeal to the principal secretary of the state health department against the verdict.        
	The complainant had singled out these two doctors but they were not guilty of medical negligence. Dilip Majumdar had conducted the surgeries himself, claimed Bose.        
	A case is also underway at the West Bengal State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission and the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission. There is another criminal case on at Alipore against Dilip Majumdar and four other doctors.

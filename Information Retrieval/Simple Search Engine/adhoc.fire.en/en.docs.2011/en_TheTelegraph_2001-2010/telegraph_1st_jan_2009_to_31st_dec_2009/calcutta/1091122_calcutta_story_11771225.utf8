	Rikisum, located on the Pedong-Lava Road, is a quaint little settlement atop a hill. It offers a magnificent view of the mountain ranges of the Kanchenjunga and is often considered the best viewpoint of the Kalimpong sub-division for viewing the hills of Kalimpong, Darjeeling, Gangtok and Pedong towns.         
	The place sounded interesting and the name musical. So we set off for it. As our jeep moved up from New Jalpaiguri, the hills, the usual greenery with its unusual charm and the silvery Teesta welcomed us. With a short break of an hour wedged in, it took us around four hours to reach Rikisum, 15km north of Kalimpong. We put up at the Swarna Sikhar Tourist Lodge in the village. The lodge is small, but cosy, consisting of two cottages with double beds and attached baths and three rooms with dual occupancy. Lunch was served in the cottage.         
	As darkness fell, the valley and the hills around the lodge took on a silvery hue, thanks to the clear sky, a bright full moon and a power cut.         
	The next morning, we trekked to a viewing point about 2km above the lodge. The view of the hills of Darjeeling, Sikkim and Bhutan, crowned by the Kanchenjunga, was breathtaking.         
	The remains of an old British rest house nearby offers ample scope for an adventure and a treat for photography enthusiasts.         
	In the evening, we hired a taxi and went to Dmsang Fort, 15 minutes from Pedong. Built in 1690, the fort was destroyed in the Anglo-Bhutanese war of 1864. As we proceeded towards the fort through a trekking route, the path seemed untrodden for years.        
	While returning, we visited Pedong but left early as we wanted to get back to our pristine hamlet at Rikisum. For the next two days, we enjoyed a lazy stay at the lodge, surrounded by the calm and beauty of nature.         
	We also went rafting in the Teesta. The adventure was thrilling but safe as we had adventure experts as guides.         
	Going         
	Take a New Jalpaiguri-bound train. Then hire a jeep for Rikisum. For visiting nearby places hire a taxi.

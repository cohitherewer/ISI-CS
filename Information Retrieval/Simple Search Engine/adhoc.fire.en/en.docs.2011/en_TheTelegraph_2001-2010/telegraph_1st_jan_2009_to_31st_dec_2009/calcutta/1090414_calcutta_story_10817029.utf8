                                                                                                               Nandaram echo in blaze
          A STAFF REPORTER                                                      A fireman battling the Burrabazar blaze.  Picture by Amit Datta        
	A 10-storeyed building two blocks away from the charred Nandaram Market caught fire on Monday, leaving around 40 people trapped for a heart-stopping half-an-hour that revived the horror of the 100-hour blaze in Burrabazar.        
	We saw people trying to wriggle out through shattered windowpanes and trying to jump from as high as the sixth floor. A few tried to grab the overhead cables to swing out of harms way, which was even more dangerous. Fortunately, everyone was rescued, said a trader.        
	Two persons, including an 80-year-old man, were injured. Gangadhar Maiti was asleep in a godown on the first floor when the fire broke out around 3.10pm. A couple of firemen broke open the door and rescued him. He was brought out unconscious but safe, barring a few bruises, said an officer at Hare Street police station.        
	The other injured person, 27-year-old Nilkanta Pal, rammed his head against a broken glass frame while trying to escape. He received five stitches.        
	For many of the occupants of the building who had seen the Nandaram fire from close quarters, Mondays incident appeared to be a near-rerun of the December 2007 blaze. Another Nandaram was barely averted. My heart is still pounding, said Pankaj Kumar Kedia of the accounting firm Prabhat amp; Company, minutes after five fire tenders had finished dousing the flames.        
	I was having lunch in my second-floor office when I heard explosions. I rushed out and was enveloped by smoke. I could not even see the staircase. I somehow managed to get out, he recalled.        
	Most of the trapped people were on the fourth, fifth and sixth floors. My mind went blank. It was like watching the Nandaram disaster all over again, said wholesaler Vinay Bagaria, who was rescued by fellow traders.         
	The fire brigade blamed disregard for basic safety norms for the blaze, which left the ground floor and the basement gutted. A fire had last broken out there in 2002.        
	Many traders were angry at the police allowing Lok Sabha candidate Mohammad Salim of the CPM and his entourage to enter the building for an inspection in the evening.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Guess whos Next on way out   Foreign brands forced to exit shop-stop 
                                                                                                               Guess whos Next on way out     -  Foreign brands forced to exit shop-stop 
          SUBHRO SAHA                          BYE-BYE:A Guess model                                        
	Falling footfall has felled all but one big name in a clutch of premium foreign brands that had come to town riding piggyback on British behemoth Marks amp; Spencer.        
	The Body Shop, Guess, Next, Accessorise and Planet Sports had set up shop at Avani Heights, opposite Calcutta Club, in late-2006 as part of the citys biggest high street shop-stop deal. Less than three years after the multi-crore deal that marked Marks amp; Spencers debut in the city, all the brands accompanying the retail giant barring The Body Shop have downed shutters.        
	Not that The Body Shop has bucked the trend because of better business. The personal care products franchise is currently offering storewide discounts.        
	Footfall has not been all that encouraging at Avani Heights, and we are looking at options to relocate to a more conducive address (for business), Swaraj Salwan, the marketing head of Planet Retail Holdings Pvt Ltd that manages the brand basket in India, told Metro from Delhi.

	Planet Retail, which was also the exclusive franchisee for Marks amp; Spencer when the Avani Heights deal was inked, later replicated the bouquet at South City Mall. But Next, a top family fashion brand in Europe, has downed shutters there as well.        
	Marks amp; Spencer has since broken away from Planet Retail and joined hands with Reliance Retail. Planet Sports is being run by the Future Group.        
	According to a spokesperson for Marks amp; Spencer, Calcutta remains an important destination for the brand and it would like to stay put at Avani Heights for the time being. We would like to keep both our stores (one at South City) running for now and look at expansion later, the spokesperson added from Delhi.        
	However, Marks amp; Spencer, which has over 400 stores in the UK and 150-plus outlets worldwide, could be forced to vacate the premises if the investor now holding the retail block insists on freeing the entire 30,000sq ft of floor space before a fresh deal.        
	Property agents are said to be trying to work out a commercial-tenant deal for the Chowringhee address.         
	Avani Heights obviously didnt click as a retail rendezvous, and walk-ins have been poor from Day One. The location is probably better suited for an office block, said Pawan Agarwal of NK Realtors.        
	A Planet Retail official promised to bring some new formats to South City to compensate for the Next shutdown.         
	But market watchers insist that the franchisee of the brand bouquet is unlikely to look for another location in the city anytime soon.        
	Calcutta is still low down in the pecking order for most premium foreign brands, and if the entire package including Marks amp; Spencer is forced to shut shop at Avani, it would send out the wrong signals to other international players waiting in the wings, said an industry source.        
	The citys retail high streets have been rocked by a spate of shutdowns of late. Sportswear biggies Adidas and Reebok have been forced to exit their Camac Street and Gurusaday Road addresses.        
	Odyssey, the largest books and music store in town, has shut down its Prince Anwar Shah Road outlet.         
	Departmental store Egaro has shut shop in Bhowanipore.        
	Whats next?

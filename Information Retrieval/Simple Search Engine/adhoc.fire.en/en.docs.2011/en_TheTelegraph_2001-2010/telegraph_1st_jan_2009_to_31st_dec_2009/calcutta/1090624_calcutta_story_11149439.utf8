	The MP Birla Group has announced plans to set up a second hospital in the city after Belle Vue clinic.        
	The 200-bed hospital will provide healthcare facilities to the economically weaker sections. We will spend Rs 10 lakh to 15 lakh per bed. We are looking for five to six acres in the suburbs to set it up, said Harsh Vardhan Lodha, a trustee and member of the managing committee of Belle Vue Clinic.        
	However, there are some problems in land acquisition given the current situation in Bengal, added Lodha.        
	The group also plans to add a 60-bed mother and childcare wing to Belle Vue Clinic in nine months.        
	A 26-bed invasive cardiac unit with provision for Cath Lab and a dedicated cardiac operating theatre are also coming up. The hospitals investment for the expansion will be around Rs 20 crore.        
	MP Birla, which runs Bombay Hospital in Mumbai, plans to set up two hospitals in Rajasthan  in Jaipur and Chittorgarh.        
	The Jaipur hospital, for which the group has acquired seven acres from the Rajasthan government, will have around 300 beds.

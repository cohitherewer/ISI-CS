The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Taxis skirt meter tests, govt sleeps
                                                                                                               Taxis skirt meter tests, govt sleeps
          ZEESHAN JAWED                                    
	The crackdown on taxis with faulty meters has fizzled out, forcing passengers to pay inflated fares despite knowing that they have been taken for a ride.        
	According to data available with Bhagwandas Vehicle Testing Services, which runs the designated meter-testing facility at Salt Lake stadium, almost 14,000 taxis plying in the city have ignored the transport departments notification issued eight months ago to get their meters calibrated.        
	Between February and September 2009, 17,284 taxis came to our centre to get their meters tested and sealed. Almost 40 per cent of these meters showed readings higher than the actual chargeable fare for a particular distance, said Vishal Agarwalla, the director of the testing centre.        
	The registration numbers of the taxis that havent turned up to get their meters tested are available with both the transport department and Bhagwandas Vehicle Testing Services but no action has been initiated against them.         
	The notification issued by the transport department (574-WT/3M-16/2009, dated February 18) had made it mandatory for all taxis registered with the public vehicles departments office in Beltola and the regional transport offices in Alipore, Barasat, Howrah and Barrackpore to get their meters calibrated at the Salt Lake centre every six months or face a fine of up to Rs 3,000.        
	Not a single taxi has, however, been booked in the past eight months for not getting its meter calibrated. A senior PVD official said the department was unable to continue the crackdown because it was severely understaffed.         
	We have only 17 motor vehicles inspectors. How can you expect us to stop every taxi and check if it has been to the centre for meter-testing? he asked.        
	While some taxis registered in Barasat, Howrah and Barrackpore have been going for meter tests, those under the Beltola PVD office and the Alipore regional transport office have remained defiant.        
	Almost 35,000 taxis are registered with the Beltola PVD office, of which 4,000 have officially gone off the road since the ban on commercial vehicles older than 15 years took effect.        
	Three taxi owners and drivers associations had moved court in the first week of April, challenging the transport departments authority to get meters checked by a private agency twice a year, against a fee. The single-judge bench of Justice J. Biswas declined to stay the government notification.        
	Union leaders claim that they havent prevented taxi operators from getting their fare meters tested since the court ruling. We are not stopping any taxi from going to the testing centre for getting their meters tested, though we arent asking anybody to go there either, said Bimal Guha, the president of the Bengal Taxi Association.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Township taps go dry for days
                                                                                                               Township taps go dry for days

	The residents of a Salt Lake housing estate hit the streets on Wednesday with empty buckets and pots to highlight the water crisis they have been facing for the past week.        
	The residents of Cluster XI of Purbachal Housing Estate decided to meet the chairman of Bidhannagar Municipality on Thursday to apprise him of the problem. They alleged that the crisis was forcing them to buy water at a high rate since March 31.        
	Our taps are running dry since March 31. In five days, we spent Rs 24,000 on buying water, said Prabhas K. Chowdhury, the director of Cluster XI of the co-operative society.        
	Biswajiban Majumder, the chairman of the civic body, denied the allegations. Lack of adequate water has always been an issue in the cluster. We have installed a tubewell and booster pumps to address the problem. The supply may have reduced a bit in the past few days but I am not aware that residents have to buy water, he said.        
	The residents say water scarcity is a major problem in this part of the township, particularly Purbachal Housing Estate which draws water from tank 13.        
	However, Cluster XI is the only part of the housing estate that doesnt get water from the tank. We used to think water dried out before reaching Cluster XI but recently we came to know this cluster doesnt have a pipeline, said Sreela Banerjee, a resident.        
	Cluster XI drew water from two nearby booster pumps, of which the one near tank 13 went out of order seven months back. The problem intensified when the other pump, at Duttabad, stopped working on March 31. It was later replaced with a pump of lesser power, which is unable to meet our requirements, said Chowdhury.        
	It is difficult for aged persons like us to carry water to higher floors. I could hardly fetch a bucket or two before I lost breath and gave up, said Aloke Kumar Sanyal, a retired government employee.        
	The residents said they could hardly fill four buckets before the taps go dry. The water we get is muddy. I have not taken a bath for the past two days, said homemaker Shweta Basu.        
	Minu Chakraborty, the former councillor of ward 20 said clusters XII, VIII, XIII and II-R, too, are facing water crisis. Cluster XII is buying 16,000 litres every day, she said.

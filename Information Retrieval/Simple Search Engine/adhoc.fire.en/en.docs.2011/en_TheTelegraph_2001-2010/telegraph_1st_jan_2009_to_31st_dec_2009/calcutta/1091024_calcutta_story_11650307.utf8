The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | More firms for big Joka batch
                                                                                                               More firms for big Joka batch
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The summer placement batch of 2010 from the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta will be the biggest in the B-schools history.        
	The economy is recovering but at a slow pace. We are doing whatever we can to ensure placement for all 408 students, 100 more than last year, of the 2009-11 batch of the postgraduate programme in management, said Paul Savio, the secretary of the institutes external relations cell.        
	The authorities are hopeful that enough companies would turn up on the Joka campus to enrol students for the two-month summer training. We have invited more companies than last year and with the economy turning around, many have already confirmed their participation, said Savio.        
	The institute is expecting that the turnout will be higher than last years 110, which was the highest in summer placement history of the Joka school.        
	Expectations are also high about the participation of the finance and consulting companies that gave the campus a miss during the final placement in March.         
	Apart from the bigwigs, the institute has also invited a large number of start-up companies for the summer placement. Second-year students, who completed their two-month internship this summer, have taken the new batch under their wings so they are better placed for the selection.

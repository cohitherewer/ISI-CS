	A raid at Alipore Central jail on Sunday afternoon led to a rich haul of six cellphones, three SIM cards, a DVD player, knife and a pair of scissors from the cells of two undertrials.        
	One of the accused, Sona, has been facing trial for his alleged role in the abduction of Khadims owner Partha Pratim Roy Burman.        
	The other, Gopal Tiwari, has been charged with the attempted murder of a businessman in Burrabazar at the behest of Haldirams owner Prabhu Shankar Agarwal.        
	The raid team stumbled upon three cellphones, two SIM cards, a DVD player that was initially thought to be a laptop and a couple of scissors in Sonas cell.        
	Tiwaris cell, adjacent to Sonas, yielded three more cellphones, a SIM card, a small knife, some ganja and wires.        
	The haul  suggesting that the inmates were plotting criminal activities even from behind bars  prompted chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti to announce a probe. We need to find out whether insiders are involved in the racket, he said.        
	An official in the state home department said the chief minister, too, was worried. Its a security breach and the jail superintendent, along with some other officials, have been pulled up. High-profile prisoners such as Aftab Ansari, who had masterminded the attack on the American Center, are lodged at Alipore Central jail.        
	Sundays raid was planned after a Sinthee-based trader complained that Sona had sent his men to him demanding money, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police, detective department. The jail administration was told about the raid at the last minute, he added.        
	In August 2008, Mohammad Sahajada, an undertrial lodged in the jail, was found carrying a cellphone and CDs of two English films while he was being brought back from court.

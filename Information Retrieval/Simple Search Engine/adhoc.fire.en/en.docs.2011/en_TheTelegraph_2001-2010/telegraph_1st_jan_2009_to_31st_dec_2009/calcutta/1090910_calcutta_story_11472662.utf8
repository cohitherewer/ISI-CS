          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The Calcutta University syndicate on Wednesday ignored a probe panels recommendation to start criminal cases against a teacher of Viharilal College found guilty of molesting a student and initiated only departmental proceedings against him.        
	The universitys sexual harassment complaints committee and a member of the state human rights commission stated in their reports that Indubhusan Mondal had molested a postgraduate student on the college campus in November 2007, a university source said on Wednesday.         
	The reports were placed before the syndicate, the universitys highest policy-making body, on Tuesday. After a long discussion, the members decided to hold another meeting on Wednesday to decide the course of action.        
	Vice-chancellor Suranjan Das announced after Wednesdays meeting that only departmental proceedings would be initiated against Mondal, a leader of the CPM-controlled Calcutta University Teachers Association.        
	According to a syndicate member, the single-member panel stated in its five-page report: The universitys complaints committee has rightly arrived at the decision that all the charges against Mondal were established. But in my personal view the university can start departmental proceedings.        
	The state human rights commission member continues: The university is at liberty to initiate criminal proceedings against Mondal under sections 354 and 509 of the Indian Penal Code on the basis of the finding of the complaints committee.

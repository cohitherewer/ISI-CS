The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | College exams just got easier
                                                                                                               College exams just got easier
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta University has overhauled its undergraduate evaluation system to ease the pressure on examinees.        
	The slew of changes announced by the undergraduate council on Thursday includes alterations in the pattern of the BA, BSc and BCom (general and honours) courses along with the examination system.         
	The new regulations have been approved by the undergraduate council and forwarded to the universitys syndicate for ratification. If the syndicate gives its approval, the revised regulations will take effect during the 2009-10 academic session itself. The changes are intended to make the examination system simpler and more student-friendly, the pro vice-chancellor (academic), Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee, said.        
	The compulsory paper on environment education has been shifted from Part I to III, and the marks at stake have been raised from 50 to 100. The move is meant to lighten the students burden during the first year, when several elective subjects are taught along with the honours papers.        
	At present, only honours subjects are taught in Part III.        
	Honours examinees can breathe easier now with the authorities deciding to allow them to write the Part II examinations even if they clear only the honours paper in Part I and fail in the pass subjects. They can clear the backlog in the Part I pass subjects when they write the Part II exams, an official said.        
	But the proposed regulations state that honours students cannot write the Part III exams without clearing the backlog. Under the system prevalent now, students are allowed to write the Part III exams even if they have a backlog from Part II.        
	Exams will be easier for general students, too. The new rules say that Part I general candidates will be allowed to write the Part II exams if they score a minimum of 30 per cent in one of their three elective papers in the first year. The present system requires them to score 25 per cent in any two of the three elective papers in Part I to be eligible for Part II.        
	In another student-friendly move, the undergraduate council has decided to award a grace mark each to all honours students who are just one short of 50, 55 or 60 per cent.        
	What it means is that a student who scores 399 out of 800 in the honours papers will be awarded an extra mark along with those who get 439 and 479 to round off their aggregate.        
	General students will also be entitled to this privilege if they fall short of 40 per cent or 50 per cent by just a mark.        
	The catch is that the marksheets of both honours and general students will show that an extra mark has been awarded.         
	The existing system allows an extra mark only to honours students who aggregate 479.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Manual Metro slower but safer
                                                                                                               Manual Metro slower but safer
  - US collision raises doubts about automatic signalling that city will adopt          TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                                                  
	Calcuttas Metro rail is safer  and slower  than Washingtons crash-hit Metrorail because of the manual signalling system it is set to replace with an automatic one.        
	 No two trains have come even close to colliding in the 25 years that we have been operating in the city with manually operated signals, said Metro Railways chief operations manager J.K. Mitra, reacting to Monday nights collision between two trains on the same track in Washington that killed nine.        
	Apart from human error, crash experts are examining the possible failure of the fail-safe computerised system that is meant to automatically bring trains to a halt if they get too close.        
	Metro Railway currently follows the absolute block system, which keeps trains two stations apart at all times. We have block system panels at alternate stations, which are all manually operated. After a train leaves Tollygunge for Dum Dum, it has to travel 180 metres beyond the third station, Kalighat, for another train to start, explained Mitra.        
	As soon as a train crosses the 180-metre mark beyond the designated station a message automatically goes to the panel operator, who then gives the green signal to the second train. But the manual system prevents Metro Railway from reducing the interval between trains to less than six minutes.        
	In any mass transit system, the target is to increase the frequency of service. We have no choice but to implement the automatic signalling system to reduce the interval between trains, said Mitra.        
	But will frequency come at the price of safety? The manual signalling system that we follow guarantees safety while even the most advanced automatic system can fail, as was probably the case in Washington, said a senior official who did not wish to be named.        
	Delhi has sanctioned funds for the automatic signalling system and the process of selecting a bidder is nearing completion. Once work starts, a fail-safe automatic system will be in place in 18 months, said Mitra.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Leak rumour before exam
                                                                                                               Leak rumour before exam
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	A rumour about Mondays Higher Secondary (HS) history examination left students in a tizzy on Monday morning, with many fearing that the exam would be cancelled because of a question paper leak.        
	Nearly an hour before the exam began at 10am, test centres across the city were abuzz with reports that several questions suggested by a coaching centre on the northern fringes of the city matched with those in the HS history question paper.        
	As the news spread, there was confusion and anxiety among the examinees as many had already reached the examination venues. We didnt know whether the information was correct. We got worried as we thought that we would not be allowed to write the exam on Monday, said an HS examinee at a centre in Ballygunge.        
	The West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education, however, described the report as a rumour. But they admitted that there was confusion among students till the exam started.         
	At 10am, when the exam started, the council authorities ran a check and said the suggestions had no similarity with the HS question paper. The exam started at the scheduled time in all the centres.        
	Swapan Sarkar, the HS council secretary, said after the council came to know about the complaint, it noted down the questions suggested by the coaching centre. When the exams started at 10am, we checked the paper and found that the format of the suggested questions was completely different, said Sarkar.        
	Only five per cent of the suggested questions had any similarity with those in the HS paper, he added.        
	He said the council would probe how the rumour originated. We want to put a stop to these incidents as such rumours create a lot of pressure on the examinees, Sarkar said.         
	A section of teachers, meanwhile, alleged that a question in Mondays HS Class XI chemistry exams was from outside the syllabus.

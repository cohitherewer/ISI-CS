	A 35kg-plus chunk of cornice smashed through the ground-floor asbestos roof of Salt Lakes AE market and dropped on fish sellers and buyers on Friday morning.        
	Five fish sellers and a buyer were injured. They were treated at Bidhannagar Sub-divisional Hospital and released. Ganesh Sarkar, one of the traders, needed two stitches in the head and sustained injuries on his legs and back.        
	The concrete chunk dropped a floor on the asbestos roof of the fish section around 10.45am, after most of the morning shoppers had left.         
	The injured buyer, Smarajeet Gupta, a 49-year-old engineer residing in AE block, said: I was about to take a packet of hilsa from the seller after paying for it when the slab dropped on us.        
	The AE market, built in 1980, attracts about 2,500 customers on an average weekday. The market was last repaired five years ago. We have repeatedly requested Bidhannagar Municipality to undertake repairs but the authorities want to tear down the market and build a mall in its place, said market secretary Laltu Biswas.        
	Biswajiban Majumdar, the chairman of the municipality, said: The market owes the municipality Rs 7 lakh in tax. The market needs to be demolished and rebuilt but the traders dont want that. Also, we dont have enough money to repair it.        
	On Thursday morning, a concrete chunk had fallen from the roof of BD Market. No one was injured in the incident.

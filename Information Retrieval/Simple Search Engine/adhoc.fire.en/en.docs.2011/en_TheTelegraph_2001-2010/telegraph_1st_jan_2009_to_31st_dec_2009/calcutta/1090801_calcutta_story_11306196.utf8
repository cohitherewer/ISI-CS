The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cops save DYFI from court 
                                                                                                               Cops save DYFI from court 
  - Videos mandatory after proof failure in Maidan-maul case          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          Litter on the Maidan after the DYFI rally on   December 20 last year. A Telegraph picture                                              
	Calcutta High Court has made video recordings of rallies in the vicinity of Victoria Memorial mandatory after being forced to let off the CPMs youth wing in the Maidan-maul case for lack of conclusive evidence.        
	The division bench of Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya and Justice Tapan Dutta blamed police for the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) escaping without punishment despite the court being sure that it violated green guidelines during the December 20, 2008, rally.        
	After going through the reports placed by the army (the custodian of the Maidan) and the joint commissioner of city police, and an affidavit filed by the DYFI, this court is sure that a violation of its order took place on the day of rally. But the report submitted by the city police and evidence placed were not enough for the court to come to a conclusion that the organisers holding the rally had violated the courts order, the bench said.        
	The court asked the police to record every moment of future rallies within a three-km radius of Victoria Memorial to ensure that no political party escaped the consequences of violating its guidelines. The police are required to video-record not only the rally but also the preparations a day ahead of the event. These recordings will have to be produced in court as and when necessary.        
	The cost of the video recordings will have to be realised from the parties that convene the rallies, the order said.        
	Metro had published a series of reports, including pictorial evidence, of how the DYFI cooked up a storm on the Maidan on December 20 despite giving the army and the police written undertakings that it would adhere to all green norms. The rally brigade dug up the greens, cooked on giant chullahs and parked buses and lorries all over the venue.        
	According to a court order issued on September 27, 2007, the use of open chullahs within a three-km radius of Victoria Memorial and parking in and around the complex are punishable offences.        
	Green activist Subhash Dutta, who had moved a supplementary affidavit seeking judicial intervention after the DYFI defiled the Maidan, said the police let the court down. The police stood up for the DYFI, which is why the court could not take action.        
	The police report denied that open chullahs were used to cook rice and chicken curry for the participants. It did mention that vehicles were parked on the Maidan but the appended photographs were inadequate as evidence.        
	From the pictures produced by the police, the numberplates of vehicles could not be recognised. Moreover, both the police and the DYFI had claimed that the violators of court orders were outsiders, the division bench said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Foul play hint in youth death
                                                                                                               Foul play hint in youth death
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 26-year-old man was found hanging from a banyan tree in Rajarhats Jatragachi area on Friday morning. Clad in a blue shirt, brown trousers and a black windcheater, the youth was identified as Sanjib Halder, a resident of Kadihati, near the airport. An identity card found inside a bag near the body revealed he worked for a courier company at its Kaikhali branch.        
	Police initially lodged an unnatural death case but later started a murder investigation. The circumstances prompted us to lodge a murder case, said an officer of North 24-Parganas police.        
	Sanjibs family members alleged that the police had initially tried to pass off the death as suicide. There was no platform on which Sanjib could have stood before hanging himself. We also found human hair on the ground and a few spots on the branches of the banyan tree where the bark had peeled off, said Biswajit Naskar, Sanjibs friend.        
	Protesting police inaction, Sanjibs family and neighbours blocked the New Town crossing of the Rajarhat Expressway for 30 minutes on Friday morning. The protesters dispersed after the police assured them of starting a murder case.        
	The cops are, however, not ruling out suicide. The family was under financial stress and Sanjib was upset about it, said an officer. We are also probing if he had taken any loan.        
	The police are awaiting the post-mortem report to confirm the exact cause of the death.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Permits for autos to speed up conversion
                                                                                                               Permits for autos to speed up conversion
          A STAFF REPORTER                           Thousands of autos plying in and around the city do not have route permits. A Telegraph picture				                                 
	The state transport department is planning to allow registered autorickshaws without permits to ply on existing routes or on ones where three-wheelers have been operating illegally to hasten their switch to LPG.        
	Around 30,000 autorickshaws in Calcutta, Howrah and North and South 24-Parganas are registered with the transport authorities but have not been allotted permits.        
	Without the permits, the three-wheelers cannot be converted to LPG. Conversion applications by the owners of some of the autos are stuck at the processing stage for this reason.        
	Inducting autos on existing routes or validating some new routes seem to be the only way out, said a senior official of the state transport department.         
	We have held talks with auto unions on the existing routes. They are reluctant to induct more autos but we hope to find a way out, he added.        
	The state government had declared that the 10,000 unregistered autos in and around the city will not be allowed to operate under any condition.         
	Many registered autos, including those without permits, have run up dues amounting to Rs 50,000 by not renewing the registration.         
	We have already decided to waive the penalty for autos whose registrations have not been renewed periodically by paying a fee, said a public vehicles department officer.        
	According to the transport department, most of the unauthorised routes are on the citys northern and southern fringes and in pockets of Howrah.         
	Hundreds of autos ply on several illegal routes in Sonarpur, Baghajatin, Lake Town, Dum Dum and other areas with the cops taking no action, said a transport official.

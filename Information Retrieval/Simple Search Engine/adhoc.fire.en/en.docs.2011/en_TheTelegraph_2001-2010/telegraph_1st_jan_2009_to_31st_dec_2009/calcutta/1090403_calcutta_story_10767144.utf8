                      Beyond theatre conventions                    One of the most influential plays of the 20th century, Luigi Pirandellos Six Characters in Search of an Author generated huge controversy at its premiere in Rome in 1921. Later, as Pirandellos reputation as a radical dramatist spread across Europe, his works began to be better understood by the audience, with the play ultimately becoming a standard in the international stage repertoire. It is, perhaps, the best known example of metatheatre, a play within a play. It begins with a troupe, in the midst of its rehearsals for a new drama. Suddenly, six people enter, claiming that their author has dumped them after creating their characters and that they want the company to perform their story. The play unfolds, with many a sensational twist and turn. While doing so, it touches upon many philosophical questions related to identity, social compulsions, relativity of values, the nature of reality, life versus art and the constant flux of existence. Yet, the play never fails to entertain, always engaging and riddling the audience by contrasting the performance of truth with the truth of performance. This evenings production by the students of Jadavpur University Department of English (JUDE), explores the limits of the theatrical conventions and poses questions about the meaning of reality. Direction: Ananda Lal.                  Event: Play in English, Six Characters in Search of an Author, produced by JUDE When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Gyan Manch

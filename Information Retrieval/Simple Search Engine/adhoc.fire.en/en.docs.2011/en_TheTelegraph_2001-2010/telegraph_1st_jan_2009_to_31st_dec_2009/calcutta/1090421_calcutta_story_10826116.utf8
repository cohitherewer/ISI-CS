The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bid by library to keep poll bandwagon at bay
                                                                                                               Bid by library to keep poll bandwagon at bay
  - Officials and readers oppose Election Commissions decision to requisition Alipore premises           IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                           SPARE ME: Will National Library fall prey to the poll process again?                                        
	National Library is fighting to shut its giant gates on the Election Commission this time after a series of intrusions over the past few years.        
	The decision to oppose a takeover of the library for any non-academic activity was taken after the commission wrote to the authorities a few days ago, saying it had requisitioned the Alipore premises for poll-related work.        
	A team of officials carried out an inspection on April 13. Its unfair to even think that they can just come in and set up base here, said a library official. The last time the election caravan had rolled into the library compound was during the Assembly poll in 2006.        
	The year before, Manmohan Singh had apologised for being party to the inconvenience caused to readers by a business event held at the Alipore address. The Prime Minister had said he wouldnt have attended the meet, organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), had he known it would disrupt regular activities at the library.        
	The CII had planned a second meet at the venue in 2006, but Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee intervened and forced it to shift the event elsewhere. But when National Library was hijacked again in 2007 for a non-academic event  the annual awards ceremony of Calcutta police  the chief minister played guest of honour.        
	For the Election Commission, the rulebook is its ally. Section 160 of the Representation of Peoples Act states that the commission can take over any premises for election-related work. An individual or organisation can, however, move court if the takeover amounts to violation of fundamental rights.        
	I understand that there will be minor disruptions, but we have to do it (requisition the sprawling premises) in the larger interest of democracy. I promise microphones wont be used this time, said chief electoral officer Debashis Sen.        
	The serene library compound was reduced to an office-cum-dormitory in 2006 after man and machine moved in to conduct polling in two Assembly constituencies, Kabitirtha and Alipore. Tents were pegged on the ground, paramilitary personnel cooked in the open, vehicles were parked everywhere and loudspeakers blared instructions round the clock.        
	It was a royal mess. There were people all over the place and entry into the library was restricted. For us, it was like someone had taken over our home. The poll brigade should definitely spare the library this time, said Amarendra Bhattacharya, 57, a regular in the National Library reading room for the past 20 years.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Novembers first nip in air
                                                                            Wednesday , November 18 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Novembers first nip in air
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The record swelter run was broken on Tuesday with the maximum temperature climbing down to normal  28.9 degrees Celsius  for the first time this month.        
	Meteorologists attributed the welcome nip in the air to Mondays showers. Parts of the city and its outskirts received light to moderate rain on Tuesday as well.        
	The relief is here to stay. We are expecting rain on Wednesday, too, which would result in a further drop in temperature, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	The Pune-based India Meteorological Department said fairly widespread rain was likely in many places across east India, including Calcutta, over the next 24 hours.        
	Tuesday, however, began warm like the previous few days with the minimum temperature  22.2 degrees Celsius  remaining four degrees above normal, down by two from Monday. But as the day progressed it became evident that Mondays rain had reined in the mercury.        
	Since the temperatures were relatively low, even high humidity, ranging between 67 and 97 per cent, could not push up the discomfort index beyond six points above normal.        
	An official of the Noida-based National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting said winter in the city was less than a fortnight away.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Happy fusion of opposites
                                                                                                               Happy fusion of opposites
          POULOMI BANERJEE                                                
	Puja mirrors the happy co-existence of contradictions that often mar rather than make Calcutta in less celebratory times.        
	From fashion to food, pandal dcor to choice of entertainment, the contrast between traditional and trendy is as pronounced as the thread of festive fervour that binds the two. Metro scans the two faces of autumn festivity to trace the meeting point of tradition and trend.                    Arati after Bodhan on Sashthi evening at a puja by a branch of Sovabazar Rajbari.

	Sovabazar Rajbari, 8.30pm on Sashthi: The thakurdalan reverberates with the beats of the dhak as the priest emerges with the arati and members of the clan crowd around him. Someone blows the conch. In that solitary moment, the old courtyard with its carved pillars is transported to a different era.         
	 This puja started in 1757, and very little has changed since. The grandeur of the celebrations may have dimmed somewhat but the rituals remain the same, explains Krishna Anjana Mitra, one of the daughters of the family.        
	Tradition is the buzzword at Sovabazar Rajbari, where 80 families with common roots meet every year. The women are all in sari and gold jewellery, with the aanchal over the head. The men, young and old, look not the least bit awkward in their dhotis. You dont try to maintain a tradition, you imbibe it, says Mitra.        
	The teenagers flaunt capris and skirts but none of them miss pandal-hopping because the fun is all at home.        
	Some may miss the event but the heart is here. My younger daughter could not come this year; she called just now and became sad on hearing the dhak, says Nandini Deb, who has never been out of the house during Puja all her married life.

	A south Calcutta puja, 11.30pm on Sashthi: The crowd, comprising mostly youngsters, erupts as Bangla band Cactus belts outs Halud Pakhi. The other face of Puja is bolder, brighter and louder.        
	Our puja is very traditional when it comes to rituals. But we do aim to strike a balance by weaving in modern elements, says one of the organisers.        
	The dress code is casual. I wear fusion clothes but I also wear saris. I might wear one on Ashtami, says Shreya, dressed in orange harem pants.        
	If you thought only GeneratioNext goes for the modern look near the mandap, think again. A mother in her forties buying popcorn for her son is dressed in a short tunic paired with leggings a la Deepika Padukone in Love Aaj Kal.        
	Another woman of similar age in a bold, sleeveless blouse jokes: I wasnt allowed to wear these as a young girl.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Dentist faces boy slap case
                                                                                                               Dentist faces boy slap case
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The family of a seven-year-old boy has lodged a police complaint alleging that a surgeon of R Ahmed Dental Medical College had slapped him hard while trying to extract a tooth.        
	Diganta Sarkar was bleeding from the gum and crying  following one extraction and while being readied for another  when surgeon Prashanta Mondal slapped him to get him to open his mouth, the complainants said.        
	He was slapped so hard that there were finger marks on his cheek and blood stains on his shirt, said the boys father Gopal Sarkar.        
	The family refused to get the second tooth extracted after the incident.        
	The hospital authorities have started a probe but denied the charge, saying the boy might have been hurt while a medical assistant gripped his head to allow the dentist to continue with the procedure.        
	Dental college principal Dibyendu Majumder said: The surgeon did not slap the boy. One of the assistants was holding the boys head tightly and that might have hurt him.        
	The Liluah resident, who had been suffering from dental problems for the past two years, was brought to the Moulali hospital on Wednesday morning for the extraction of two teeth.        
	After the extraction of one tooth, my son started bleeding and crying in pain, recalled Gopal, a manager at a Howrah factory. He was so scared that he refused to open his mouth when the doctor wanted to administer the anaesthetic injection for the second extraction. It was then that the surgeon slapped my son.        
	The family members said that the doctor later apologised for his conduct. On Thursday morning, they lodged a complaint with Muchipara police station.        
	P.K. Chatterjee, the deputy commissioner (headquarters), said: A case has been started against the doctor.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cheat in judges gown held
                                                                                                               Cheat in judges gown held
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A 33-year-old man who allegedly cheated several loan and credit card defaulters by pretending to be a judge was arrested in his Shanti Ghosh Street home-cum-office on Wednesday night.        
	Pramurta Kalyan Pal, whose three accomplices are on the run, sent legal notices to banks on behalf of the defaulters after charging each of them a percentage of their dues.        
	Pal and his associates, on the basis of a forged document of the Permanent Arbitration Tribunal of India, would sent notices to banks waiving the dues of defaulters. They charged 10 to 15 per cent of the dues as legal charges, said an officer of the detective department.        
	They named their entire set-up as Calcutta Court Number 1 Special Bench and passed orders. Pals associates used to pose as jury members, added the officer.         
	Pal allegedly used to dress up in judges robes to fool his clients. The police seized gowns, stamp papers and legal documents from his office.         
	The racket recently sent an injunction to a private bank on behalf of Sanjay Pal, who had defaulted on a payment of Rs 1.5 lakh. The bank immediately got in touch with us. An investigation revealed that a gang was at work, said an investigator.         
	The police are yet to find out how many people were fooled by the four and how much money they lost.        
	According to police sources, Pal had sent notices to a number of banks. They, however, did not send their representatives to the arbitration sessions or waive the dues.        
	The police are trying to find out how the defaulters got in touch with Pal and his partners.

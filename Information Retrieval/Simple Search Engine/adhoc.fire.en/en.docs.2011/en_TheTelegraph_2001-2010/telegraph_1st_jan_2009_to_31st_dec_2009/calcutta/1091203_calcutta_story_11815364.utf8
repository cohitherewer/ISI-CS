                Ten passengers were injured when the front axle of a private bus broke and its front wheels came off near Mathpukur on the EM Bypass on Wednesday morning. Two of the injured were hospitalised. Police said the bus, which was going from Ultadanga to Gariahat, will be sent for tests to ascertain why the axle broke. An officer said the police were trying to contact the vehicle owner to ascertain whether its permit was valid and whether it had a fitness certificate. The bus driver escaped.    A 20-year-old youth was found hanging from a tree in Jagaddal, Howrah, on Wednesday afternoon, sparking tension in the area. Police said the body of Bholanath Thakur, a student of Rishi Bankim Chandra College, was spotted by local residents and a bottle of poison was found in his pocket. The veins of his left arm were slashed and there were other injury marks on his body, an officer said. A probe revealed Thakur was worried about marrying off his three younger sisters. The body was sent for post-mortem.    Three persons were arrested on Tuesday night in Jhargram in connection with a theft at a cellphone shop on Lenin Sarani in October. Hasan Sheikh, 26, and two aides were brought to Calcutta on Wednesday. Hasan said he had put up at a guesthouse above the shop two days before the theft and visited the store several times. Police recovered two of the 217 stolen cellphones from the trio.     Relatives of Arpit Sharma, a Class X student admitted to a Howrah nursing home, lodged a police complaint on Wednesday alleging medical negligence. The boy was admitted to the Dobson Road nursing home on Tuesday after being diagnosed with malignant malaria. His father Pramod said he found his sons bed soaked in blood on Wednesday. When he alerted doctors and nurses, they allegedly did not pay heed.    Two posters of the CPI (Maoists) were found on police kiosks near PNB and BD Market in Salt Lake on Tuesday.

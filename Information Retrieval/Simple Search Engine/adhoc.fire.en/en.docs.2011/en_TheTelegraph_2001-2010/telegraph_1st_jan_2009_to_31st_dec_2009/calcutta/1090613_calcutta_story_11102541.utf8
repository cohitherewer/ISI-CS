The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 150 girls expelled in rap on the rowdy 
                                                                                                               150 girls expelled in rap on the rowdy 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two colleges on Friday expelled 150 students for unruly behaviour.        
	Jogamaya Devi College showed the door to 95 girls and Muralidhar Girls College to 55. The authorities said the students were guilty of having gheraoed the principals  one of whom was also assaulted  after being debarred from appearing in the Part I exam for low attendance.        
	Dhrubojyoti Chattopadhyay, the pro vice-chancellor of Calcutta University to which both colleges are affiliated, welcomed the move. Students must attend classes regularly and abide by all rules and regulations of the college and the university, including the one on attendance, Chattopadhyay said.        
	Several students of Jogamaya Devi College, some accompanied by their guardians, had gheraoed and assaulted principal Gargi Nath on April 24 after she turned down their demand that they be allowed to sit for the Part I exam despite their low attendance. College officials said some of the protesters had attended less than 10 per cent of the classes.        
	Rules state students have to attend at least 75 per cent of the classes to be eligible to sit for the university exams.        
	An official of Jogamaya Devi College said: The authorities had identified 95 students who had created trouble after being debarred from writing the Part I test. They have been expelled. But 40 of them, found less guilty, can seek re-admission. We will consider taking them back if seats are available after accommodating fresh candidates.         
	On April 21, three days before the Jogamaya Devi incident, 55 students of Muralidhar Girls College had gheraoed principal Manjusha Tarafdar on the same issue.        
	The authorities said the punishment would not be revoked for 38 of the 55 students. We have asked the rest to apologise and apply for fresh admission. But our preference will be fresh candidates.

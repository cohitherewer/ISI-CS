The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Blocked roads, flooded hangars 
                                                                                                               Blocked roads, flooded hangars 
  - Brush with cyclone leaves trail of disruption and damage          OUR BUREAU                          Pedestrians and a cyclist struggle to reach their destination at Ballygunge Place on Tuesday. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                        
	The Aila effect continued to tell on all forms of transport throughout Tuesday.        
	On the road, uprooted and broken trees were the biggest obstacle. The low number of private buses  only 5,000 private buses hit the road compared with 13,000 on a usual weekday  gave commuters a harrowing time.         
	After waiting 20 minutes for a bus I took an auto but it got stuck in a jam caused by a fallen log. The auto took a detour to reach Tollygunge Metro station, said Shreya Ray, a resident of Naktala.        
	Swarnakamal Saha, the president of Bengal Bus Syndicate, said fewer buses ran on Tuesday as most of the roads were blocked and many employees did not turn up for work. Also, around 10 buses were damaged in Mondays storm, added Saha.         
	Twenty per cent of the 500-plus government buses also stayed off the road.        
	Metro spotted a private bus on Hospital Road plying on route 12C/1 with only one conductor on board and one of the gates shut. The other conductor lives in Baruipur and could not get transport to the city. Even the driver is hired, said Ratan Dey, the conductor.        
	Many taxis, too, did not ply with the drivers apprehending blocked roads and few passengers.         
	I saw a live electric wire lying on the road near my Garia home. On Monday, a tree had almost fallen on my taxi. The owner of the vehicle asked me to not take chances and stay indoors, said Jaswant Singh, a taxi driver.        
	Madan Mitra, the secretary of the Progressive Taximens Association, said the cab count was down to half on Tuesday.        
	Five of the 12 hangars at the airport remained submerged under three to four feet water, which hampered maintenance. Airport officials said the waterlogging was a result of the municipal authorities not cleaning the drains.         
	Three long-distance trains  the Howrah-Barbil Janashatabdi Express, Howrah-Bhubaneswar Dhauli Express and the Up and Down Rupasi Bangla Express were cancelled on Tuesday. The Purulia Howrah Express was also cancelled.        
	Trains will run on schedule on Wednesday, said an official of South Eastern Railway.        
	The trail of disruption and destruction extended to the campuses.        
	Calcutta University did not hold any examination on Tuesday. Many of our students are from areas affected by the cyclone and might not have been able to appear in the exams, said an official.        
	Jadavpur University, which cancelled semester exams scheduled for Monday afternoon, is drawing up a new schedule. Several trees were uprooted and windowpanes damaged on the campus.        
	We have almost removed the trees that had fallen in the compound and the tree that crashed over the gate on to the pavement, said Pradip Ghosh, the registrar of the university.        
	The Indian Institute of Management campus in Joka also saw uprooted trees and torn electric and telephone wires. I was afraid of stepping out of my class on Monday afternoon. When I finally ventured out, the campus looked like a battleground, said a professor of the institute.        
	While the campus was almost back in shape on Tuesday, pockets in Tiljala and Behala remained under knee-deep water. The sewer lines are clogged but the civic body has not made any effort to clear them. Rainwater entered several houses in the area, said Atanu Das, a Tiljala resident.         
	Live wires from fallen lamp posts are dangling precariously and might prove fatal any time, said another resident.         
	Residents of KK Roy Road, Narayan Roy Road and parts of Silpara in Behala could not step out as the area remained flooded till Tuesday night.        
	A number of ATMs were also down because of network problems.

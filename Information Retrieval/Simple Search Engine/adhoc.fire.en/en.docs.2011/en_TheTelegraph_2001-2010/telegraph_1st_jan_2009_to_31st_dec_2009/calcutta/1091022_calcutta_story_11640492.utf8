          A STAFF REPORTER                          BC Roy Memorial Hospital                                  
	The pollution control board on Wednesday sought a report from the superintendent of BC Roy Memorial Hospital for Children on the impact of crackers on newborn babies and infants.        
	The tiny tots were jolted out of their sleep on Diwali night while the cracker ban was being reduced to ashes.        
	Hospital superintendent M.K. Chatterjee will have to submit the report within seven days, mentioning the medical implications of the babies exposure to high-decibel sound as well as describing the situation in the hospital compound on Diwali, which forced several parents to call the cops.        
	The report will help us take action against the offenders. That a newborn baby suffered because of bursting of crackers could be used as vital evidence, said Biswajit Mukherjee, the boards chief law officer.        
	On October 17 evening, Diwali revellers had a free run of the Phoolbagan child care unit premises  the states only referral hospital for children  with rockets hitting the windows of the neo-natal care unit. Many babies were jolted out of sleep and started shivering.        
	Parents called Phoolbagan police station several times but the situation didnt improve. Later, Chatterjee lodged a police complaint against unknown persons.         
	Mukherjee said he had visited the hospital twice while patrolling the city on Diwali night, but despite warnings by his team, the bursting of crackers didnt stop. Board officials found the noise in the silence zone close to 90 decibel, almost twice the prescribed limit, he said.        
	A board member said if the evidence against offenders nabbed from the hospital compound on Diwali was strong enough, they could be booked under the Environment Protection Act, 1986.        
	The board also questioned dealers in Burrabazar on Wednesday about the sale of banned crackers. On October 11, 41 of the 55 tested failed to make the cut. That was just six days before Kali puja, so the items must have reached traders by then, a board member said.        
	The police brass have found that enough forces were not deployed to enforce the cracker ban properly and there was little coordination among patrol teams, said a senior officer.

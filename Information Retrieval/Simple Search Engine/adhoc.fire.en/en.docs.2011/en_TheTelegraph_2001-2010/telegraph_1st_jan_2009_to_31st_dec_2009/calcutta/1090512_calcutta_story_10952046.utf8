The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Early deadline for artisans
                                                                                                               Early deadline for artisans

	With early deadlines knocking on the door this year (Saptami is on September 25), images of Durga and her entourage are fast filling the Kumartuli studios.        
	We usually start making idols from mid-April but this year we began as early as in March in order to meet the early deadlines, said Kamal Pal, whose studio is chock-a-block with 16 Durga idols.         
	Orders started pouring in from April, which usually doesnt begin before Rath Yatra (on June 24 this year). Several people have placed orders for traditional Durga images and we are now working on those. We will start work on the theme idols once the layouts have been drawn and approved, said artisan Apurba Pal.         
	The Kumartuli people fear that the brief gap of a week between Viswakarma puja and Durga puja will spell a space crunch in their studios, resulting in a drop in revenue.         
	We wont be able to take as many orders for Viswakarma idols as in previous years simply because we will have to make room for Durga idols, which fetch more money. So, I will have to forgo about 30 Viswakarma idols. This will be a huge setback for me, said artisan Sailen Pal. The shortage of space will force every studio in Kumartuli to make 20 to 30 Viswakarma idols less, which means about a 20 per cent dip in revenue, said Mintu Pal, the joint secretary of Kumartuli Mritshilpi Sanskritik Samity.         
	The workload will also trigger a rise in labour charges, feel artisans. Most of our labourers come from the rural areas and have now gone home for the elections. As a result, our work has slowed down, added Apurba Pal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Basement fire doused
                                                                                                               Basement fire doused
          A STAFF REPORTER                          A lane next to the building that was enveloped in smoke for the past two days. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                  
	The blaze at the six-storeyed Model House on Strand Road was doused early on Sunday after almost 48 hours of firefighting. The flames were brought under control on Friday but could not be put out till Sunday.        
	The origin of the fire, which caused damage worth lakhs, is yet to be determined.        
	The building did not have a fire licence. Those who had stored combustible material in it also did not take permission. We will lodge an FIR against the owner of the building with Burrabazar police station on Monday, said Gopal Bhattacharya, the director of fire and emergency services.        
	According to fire department sources, the owner will be charged under Section 11C (lacking an in-built fire protection system) and Section 12 (not possessing the licence to possess and store potentially hazardous materials) of the West Bengal Fire Services Act and Section 285 (negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible matter) of the IPC.        
	Firemen said pesticides, PVC pipes and rubber and polythene goods were stored in the 40,000sq ft basement, where the fire started.         
	The basement was filled with thick, poisonous smoke. Most of the shutters were pulled down. We could not enter the basement and doused the flames by flooding the floor to a height of 12ft, said a senior fire officer.        
	Water will continue to be sprayed at the 40 Strand Road address for the next couple of days to cool it down, said Bhattacharya.        
	After the Nandaram fire, we, along with Calcutta police and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, had prepared a list of buildings in Burrabazar with inadequate fire safety measures. Model House was on the list. A notice was served but the owners did not pay heed to it, he added.        
	Two firemen were hospitalised after the poisonous fumes got into their lungs and eyes. Another officer singed his back after falling down.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Midfield move for French magician   Zizou star of French buffet
                                                                                                               Midfield move for French magician     - Consul-general sets the ball rolling for Zidanes tryst with soccer-crazy city          SUBHRO SAHA                      Rysto; (above) Zidane

	After the madness over Maradona, Calcutta could soon get a chance to go zany about Zinedine Zidane.        
	The effort to steer Zizou to town is being made by Jean-Louis Rysto, the new consul-general of France and head of economic mission in Calcutta, as the goalkeeper-turned-diplomat looks to revive the citys once-strong French connection.        
	Yes, thats my dream, to bring Zidane to this soccer-crazy city, and I have already moved the authorities in Paris about this. The former manager of the French national team, Aim Jacquet, is a close friend of mine and I plan to approach Zidane through him also, says Rysto, a lower-league goalkeeper in France during his younger days.        
	The visit of the midfield magician who won France the World Cup in 1998 may not materialise so soon as to coincide with the Bonjour India (Good Morning India) festival planned for this December, the diplomat points out. It all depends on his very tight schedule worked out by his sponsors. Its my wish to be able to bring him to Calcutta during the course of my three-year tenure, and I will also move the Fdration Franaise de Football for this, smiles Rysto.        
	The French consulate office, which now functions out of a Tivoli Court apartment, is set to move into its sprawling permanent address, the Maharaja Santosh Palace on Raja Santosh Road, in September. The mission hopes to issue French visas from its city office this autumn.        
	Ten years ago, our government closed the consulate office in Calcutta and shut down the economic mission three years back. We all realise it was a monumental mistake and as per president (Nicolas) Sarkozys directive, we reopened our full-fledged consulate in Calcutta, at a time when across the world mission offices are being shut down, he says. The French are now keen to make up for lost time and reactivate the strong link with Calcutta that once saw then French president Mitterrand come down to Satyajit Rays doorstep to present him with the Legion of Honor.                    
	So, while Calcuttans wait for their date with Zizou, they can savour French cuisine rustled up by a celebrity chef flown in from Paris, soak in the strains of a French jazz ensemble and root for their favourite thoroughbreds during a French horseracing Grand Prix.        
	All these are likely to feature in the Bonjour India winter carnival in December. Also on the cards is a mesmerising montage of trick-lighting featuring the local craftsmen of Chandernagore and French laser-show experts who light up the Eiffel Tower and the bridges across the Seine.        
	Chandernagore is high priority for us, Rysto stresses. A plethora of initiatives are being planned for the former French colony  a museum of relics, a French-style hotel, and better river connectivity with Calcutta.        
	The French mission is also planning a much more attractive and spacious Alliance Francaise, which will also house a typical French restaurant or caf.

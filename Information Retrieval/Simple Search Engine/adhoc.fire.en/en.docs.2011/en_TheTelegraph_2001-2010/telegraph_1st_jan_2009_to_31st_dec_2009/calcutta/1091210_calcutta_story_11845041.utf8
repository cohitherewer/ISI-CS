	The Vinodh Gupta School of Management (VGSOM), the B-school at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, will hike the fees for its flagship programme by 150 per cent from the next session.         
	Following the recent trend in other educational institutes, the fees for the two-year postgraduate diploma course would be increased from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 5 lakh from July 2010.         
	Most other institutes are charging much higher fees. We are in the process of improving our infrastructure too, said Damodar Acharya, the director of IIT Kharagpur.         
	The B-school authorities have decided to offer between 50 per cent and 100 per cent fee waivers to 25 per cent students of the 120-strong batch.        
	The VGSOM will also introduce two executive MBA programmes in the next academic year  one exclusively for IT professionals, to be offered at the IITs Bhubaneswar campus, and the other a general executive course, to be taught at the Salt Lake campus. Both will be three-year courses. Classes will be held in the evenings on weekends via video conferencing and classroom lectures, said Acharya.         
	The institute is also planning to start management development programmes, more international tie-ups and faculty training.

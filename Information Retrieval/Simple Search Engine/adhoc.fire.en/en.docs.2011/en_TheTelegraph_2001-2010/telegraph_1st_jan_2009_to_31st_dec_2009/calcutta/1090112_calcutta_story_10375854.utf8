          A STAFF REPORTER                          Footfall at Vishal Mega Mart dropped on Sunday. Picture by Pranab Biswas                                  
	Surveillance camera footage has provided police the only leads in the robbery outside Vishal Mega Mart at Kamarhati on Saturday.        
	Investigators are not yet sure whether a new or an old gang shot a guard of a security agency and escaped with Rs 1.40 lakh in cash he and two others were carrying to the bank from the store.        
	Sketches are being made from the grainy footage to nab the three who had attacked the guards. The police suspect that a resident had tipped them off about the system of money collection from the store by a resident.        
	We are interrogating employees of the security agency and going through the list of the employees sacked by the store in the recent past, said an investigator.        
	A similar robbery attempt was made in December in front of a distributors office of a reputed FMCG company in the area. It was not successful. We are checking out if the same gang was behind yesterdays robbery, added the officer.        
	The three who carried out the operation were not residents of the area, according to the police.        
	The effect of the robbery was evident at the cash counters of the mall on Sunday. The footfall was well below that on a typical holiday.        
	We do not know why but till evening, the number of customers was well below the average. We have strengthened our security, said an official of the store.

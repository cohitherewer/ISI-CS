The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bus crushes single mother
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Bus crushes single mother
          A STAFF REPORTER                             (Top) Baby Singh and Sharmila Singh. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                 
	A single mother taking her daughter to school was crushed under the wheels of a private bus in front of RG Kar hospital on Friday morning.         
	Baby Singh was trying to cross RG Kar Road holding her daughter Sharmilas hand when a bus plying on route 3D (WB 25A 2637) speeded towards them. The 35-year-old fell down while trying to get out of the way. The buss rear wheels crushed her head.         
	Sharmila, a Class VIII student of a school near Deshbandhu Park, was unhurt. She and her brother Suman, a Class IV student of the same school, had been living with their mother after their father abandoned the family.        
	The woman was trying to rush across the road after signalling to the driver to stop but he did not even slow down. She probably tripped on her sari and fell face down on the tram tracks, said a shopkeeper who saw the mishap. Timir Pal, the driver, did not realise that he had run over Baby, a Group D employee of the hospitals nursing hostel. He stopped the bus hearing the cries of pedestrians.        
	Pal was arrested for negligent driving, said deputy commissioner (traffic) Dilip Bandopadhyay.         
	Another police officer said Pal might not have been at fault. Pedestrians in Calcutta have the habit of just signalling to the driver and walking across the road. They should be more careful.        
	Witnesses told Metro that Sharmila passed out on seeing her mother crushed under the wheels.        
	Babys husband left them years back. She had worked hard to raise the children. The children are obedient and good in studies. I dont know what will happen to them now, said a neighbour of the family at Sarkarpara, off RG Kar Road.         
	Residents demanded better policing on the stretch. More cops should be posted in the area. A speed limit should also be enforced on the road, said a resident.

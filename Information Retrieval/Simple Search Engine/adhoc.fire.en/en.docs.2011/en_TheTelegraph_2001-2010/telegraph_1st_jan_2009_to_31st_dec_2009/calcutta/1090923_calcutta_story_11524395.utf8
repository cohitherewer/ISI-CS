The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Festive fun at doorstep
                                                                                                               Festive fun at doorstep
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	If home is where the heart is this festive season, your apartment puja will mean more to you than the big-ticket pujas around town.        
	And that is where The Telegraph Hand In Hand comes in. Starting off in 15 housing complexes in 2003, the programme embodying the spirit of camaraderie and cheer among neighbours, has now crossed the century mark.        
	For Puja 2009, The Telegraph Hand In Hand, held in association with Bajaj Almond Drops Hair Oil, will spread joy, cheer and bonhomie at 102 apartment addresses.        
	From Lake Gardens to Madhyamgram and from Salt Lake to Garia, from Sashthi to Dashami, there will be a host of cultural activities and competitions aimed at making Puja a memorable affair for the residents of apartment blocks.        
	From Sit and Draw to Spot Quiz, Antakshari to Dhunuchi Naach, Recipe Contest to Three Minutes to Fame and Shriman Shrimati to a Miss Beautiful Hair contest, the Telegraph Hand In Hand events pack in something for everyone.        
	The residents of our complex  young and old alike  are looking forward to the Hand In Hand events. Antakshari and Sit and Draw are huge hits, says Subhro Sengupta of City High, a Prince Anwar Shah Road highrise where The Telegraph Hand In Hand enters its third year.        
	For most apartments, it is the personal touch that makes Hand in Hand special. The events are fun and have a large number of participants. Besides the ever-popular Antakshari, Three Minutes to Fame has a large number of participants, says Mita Paul of Aloka Puri on Ballygunge Circular Road, which has been with The Telegraph Hand In Hand from the beginning.        
	Adding to the festive feel and helping neighbours to bond better lie at the core of the annual activity. The Hand in Hand activities make Puja more colourful and lively. After the fun we had last year, many residents have even cancelled pandal-hopping plans to take part in the activities, says Kamal Dhariwal of Behala Diamond Enclave.

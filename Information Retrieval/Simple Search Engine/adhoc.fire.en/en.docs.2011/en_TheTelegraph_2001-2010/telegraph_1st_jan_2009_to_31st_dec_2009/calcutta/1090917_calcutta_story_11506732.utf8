                      Flying colours of joy                    Kite festivals are a popular form of entertainment throughout the world. They include small local events, traditional festivals which have been held for hundreds of years and major international festivals which bring in overseas kite-fliers to display their unique artistic wares and demonstrate their latest gizmo-equipped toys. Having its origins in fishing aids used by the early natives of South Sea Islands and China, kite-flying became a popular game with the passage of time, and was gradually incorporated into the local customs of various Asian countries. The traditional Indian festival of Makar Sankranti is devoted to kite-fighting in some states. This spring festival is celebrated around the middle of January, with millions of people flying kites all over northern and western India. In West Bengal, kite-flying takes on a ritualistic fervour on September 17, the day on which Viswakarma Puja is celebrated. Long queues can be seen in front of kite shops as children and adults buy varieties of colourful kites to indulge in day-long festivities and kite-flying takes on a competitive colour. The skyline is dotted with multi-coloured kites as occasional shouts of bhno-katta accompanies the de-stringing of a kite from a latai (spool). Preparations start much in advance to meet the demand for kites on this day. To mark this auspicious date on the Bengali religious calendar, Priya Entertainments Pvt Ltd hosts Kite Festival, a kite-flying competition. Inauguration by Sudeshna Roy and Rimjhim Mitra. Also, the release of Tollai, a book on kites for children by Aloke Chatterjee and the beginning of Ghuri, an exhibition on kites (till September 20; 12 noon - 5 pm).

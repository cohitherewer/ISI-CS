The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Student held for visa fraud
                                                                                                               Student held for visa fraud
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A hotel management student from Gujarat, who flew to London from Calcutta allegedly on a forged visa, was arrested at the city airport early on Tuesday after being deported.        
	Chiragbhai Sureshbhai Patel, a 25-year-old resident of Navsary in Gujarat, took a Lufthansa flight to London via Frankfurt on April 29.         
	Immigration officials in London found that his papers were not in order and detained the youth.        
	The city airport authorities have pulled up the immigration official who had checked Patels documents and allowed him to board the flight to London.        
	I have asked the officer for an explanation. If he is unable to provide a satisfactory reply, stringent action will be taken against him, said Basab Talukdar, the regional registration officer in Calcutta for foreigners and the deputy commissioner (security control).         
	Patel had gone to the UK through Calcutta in 2005 for studying hotel management. He had acquired a student visa and a post-study work permit from the UK government, which allowed him to take up odd jobs in his free time. The visa and the permit expired on December 20 last year.        
	The UK government had rejected his application for renewal of the documents as he had worked for more hours than was allowed, said Talukdar.        
	Desperate to continue his education, Patel allegedly acquired a forged visa and residence permit from an agent in London and used them to fly to the UK.         
	Last year, the immigration department at Calcutta airport underwent a revamp.         
	Hi-tech gadgets were installed in the international terminal of the airport to detect forged passports and other documents.         
	Closed-circuit television cameras were also set up to step up vigilance.

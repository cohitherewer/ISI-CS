                                                                                                               Hurdles to Garia Metro removed
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The dispute holding up the extension of Metro Railway services from Tollygunge to Garia were removed on Friday at a meeting chaired by transport minister Subhas Chakraborty.         
	The chairman of Rajpur-Sonarpur Municipality, Kamal Ganguly, said the extension project missed its December 2007 deadline because of a dispute over the demolition of a municipal building and a road  Nepal Sarani  that fall on the rail route.        
	Work hasnt progressed beyond Garia Station Road, near the municipality office.        
	Fridays meeting  attended by officials of Metro Railway, the municipality and the South 24-Parganas administration, decided to demolish the building and construct a new office.         
	An alternative road will be laid, too.        
	Metro Railway will bear the expenditure on both, Ganguly said.        
	The meeting, however, did not fix a date for the resumption of work.        
	 Ganguly said the municipality would prepare an estimate for the construction of the building within a fortnight. Around Rs 25 lakh will be required for the new office, he said.         
	The district administration will acquire the land for the alternative road and the municipality will execute both projects.

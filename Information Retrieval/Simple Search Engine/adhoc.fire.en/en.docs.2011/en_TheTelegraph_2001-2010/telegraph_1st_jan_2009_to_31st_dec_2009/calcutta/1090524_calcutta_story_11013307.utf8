                              The Sunderbans coastline being eroded by the sea                            
	Experts have pointed out the Sunderbans extreme vulnerability to climate change and the consequent sea level rise and the state government has formed expert committees and commissioned studies to find the extent of the impact of global warming on the Sunderbans and elsewhere in the state. But strangely enough a few senior officials from the state feel that not much is wrong with the climate of West Bengal.        
	Recently at a meeting chaired by chief secretary Ashok Mohan Chakrabarti at the state pollution control board to finalise the states strategy to combat climate change, a senior forest department official and an official from the department of science and technology made light of the climate threat to the state.        
	The meeting was organised by the state environment department and the department of science and technology.         
	Inundation is nothing new in the Sunderbans and there is no point in panicking and attributing everything to climate change. The Sunderbans is definitely not more threatened by climate change than, say, Calcutta, New York or the Netherlands, claimed Atanu Raha, the chief conservator of forest.         
	Raha also ruled out habitat shrinkage and thus straying of wild animals within human habitations, which has been on the rise, as a result of the increased inundation prompted by climate change.         
	When it was pointed out that a model prepared by the WWF found that the tiger population can greatly recede in the Sunderbans because of sea level rise, Raha said: I have been hearing this since my early days in office. However, he did not furnish any data or study in support of his claim.        
	Partha Sarathi Chakrabarty , the chief scientist of the department of science and technology, went a step further and tried to establish that climate change and melting of glaciers in Himalayas are a figment of the imagination.         
	Other environment experts criticised his view. It is your personal opinion and it can negate the goal of holding such a seminar. I request you to go through numerous documents published in reputed national and international journals which are contrary to your opinion, said an environment department official at the meet.        
	Earlier chief secretary Chakrabarti had said that the climate change threat has become real in the state and cannot be put on the back burner any longer.         
	Will somebody care to tell these officials that the sea level in the Sunderbans has been rising at a rate of 3.14 mm per year against a global average of around 2 mm, a climate expert said.         
	Such observations by key state officials making light of climate change threat in the state sum up their callousness and highlight their ineligibility to counter such huge environmental threat, he added.                          JAYANTA BASU

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Burglars clean out flat 
                                                                                                               Burglars clean out flat 
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A gang broke into a fourth-floor flat in a highrise building on Cossipore Road and walked away with jewellery worth around Rs 2 lakh and Rs 5,000 in cash.        
	The flat was under lock and key from April 22 with the owner, a trader named Sanjay Vajpayee, attending a family wedding in Kanpur and his wife Rekha and their three children at her parents house in Posta.        
	On Wednesday morning, a milkman noticed the door of the flat open and alerted Sanjays relative Uday Shankar Mishra, who lives on the floor above.        
	According to police, the gang entered the flat by breaking the bolt on the door and moved into the room that had two almirahs. They took valuables but didnt touch inexpensive ornaments.        
	An investigator said the burglars had information that there would be nobody in the flat for a few days and that the flat opposite to it would also be locked.        
	The guard had left for his ancestral home in Madhepura, Bihar, asking a local youth named Sanjay Upadhyay to perform his duties till he returned, said Mishra.        
	The six-storeyed building has two entrances. The main one is usually closed at night. Since there has not been a burglary in our building, there could have been some slackness, he added.        
	A team of officers from Chitpur police station and the detective department visited the flat and interrogated a help of the Vajpayees. She claimed to have seen an unknown youth leave the building on Tuesday night before the main gate was closed.        
	We were supposed to return to the flat on Thursday. My husband was scheduled to reach the city on Thursday. Apart from gold ornaments, several silver items have been stolen, said Rekha.        
	Sanjay, who ran a garment business before switching to tea trade, has been living in the flat with his family for over a decade. He found out about the burglary from his relatives on his way to the city on a train.        
	Residents said the burglary might have been carried out by some people who frequented the building and were confident that their presence would not arouse suspicion.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mall plans hold up township mart repair 
                                                                                                               Mall plans hold up township mart repair 
                                          
	Chunks of cement collapsed at two Salt Lake markets last week, injuring six. Market authorities have accused Bidhannagar Municipality of dragging its feet on repairs while the civic body blamed the markets for not paying taxes in time. Metro visits two of the 16 civic markets in the township              
	AE Market        
	Established: 1981         
	Stalls: 105         
	Average daily footfall: 1,200        
	What we saw: The portion of the cornice that had collapsed last Friday was still not repaired. Rainwater was seeping through the roof and walls. The green belt at the entrance was littered with garbage and clogged drains made the place a breeding ground of mosquitoes. Shop owners complained of poor water supply. Parts of the ceiling above the market toilet were broken.        
	Shopkeepers version: We have asked the municipal authorities to repair the market several times but they want to demolish it and build a mall instead, to which we have serious objections, said Laltu Biswas, the market secretary.              
	BD Market        
	Established: 1976        
	Stalls: 197        
	Average daily footfall: 900        
	What we saw: The concrete shade over the first-floor balcony was hanging precariously. Chunks of cement have fallen off, exposing rusty iron rods, which often get stolen, further weakening the structure. Shopowners fear concrete pieces or broken rods may fall on them any time. Naked electrical wires were spread along the ceiling and dangled dangerously near one of the gates. Uneven flooring poses a problem for shoppers.        
	Shoppers version: The condition of the market has deteriorated over the years. I feel unsafe shopping there after a series of mishaps. I understand that the authorities are planning to convert the market into a mall but they should take care of our basic needs and make immediate repairs, said Biplab Gupta, an elderly resident of the block.        
	Municipalitys version: Most of the markets are old and badly designed. Poor quality materials were used and minor repairs wouldnt solve the problem, said civic chairman Biswajiban Majumder.         
	He added that most of the markets were yet to clear their civic tax dues.

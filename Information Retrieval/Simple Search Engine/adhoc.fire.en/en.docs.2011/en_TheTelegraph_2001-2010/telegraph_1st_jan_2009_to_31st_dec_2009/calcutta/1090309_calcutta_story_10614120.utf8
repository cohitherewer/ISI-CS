The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | United against green grab
                                                                                                               United against green grab
                              The Maidan was damaged during a recent DYFI rally                            
	A flurry of emails to the Metro inbox has greeted the transport ministers bid to grab the Maidan. Here are some of the expressions of outrage:              
	It is time to unite irrespective of political colours and say: No. Never. We, the Calcuttans, will not spare the Maidan at any cost.        
	C. Bose              
	No comprise should be made on the Maidan issue. Isnt the air we are breathing polluted enough? Hasnt the state done enough damage already that they are now bent on grabbing the Maidan? If the government does not back away, I am ready to take the streets.         
	Samhita Bose              
	The Maidan grab bid shows yet again how arrogant, careless, senseless and ruthless politicians in Bengal are. Is this an autocracy that people have to beg to save their patch of green? Calcuttas so-called intellectuals should take up cudgels for the Maidan.        
	Arju Pal Toronto, Canada        
	I request the defence minister not to look at the Maidan issue as a tool to please the Bengal government for political benefits. What Calcuttans want to do about the Maidan is of prime importance.         
	The citys lungs are not the state governments property. Its handover to the government would mean our death.        
	Krishna Roy        
	It is time for the entire city to stand up and protest against the state governments decision to destroy the green heart of the city.         
	Mohammad Azharuddin               
	Under no circumstances, should Subhas Chakraborty be allowed to grab the Maidan. He has been a total failure as transport and sports minster and has single-handedly destroyed the Salt Lake stadium, Howrah maidan and Curzon Park.        
	A.S. Mehta              
	Even the idea of the arrogant government laying claim to the Maidan is revolting. We cannot permit political hoodlums to maul our greenery. Instead of tackling the real problems the ministers have the temerity to seek control of the few open spaces in the city. They are, it seems, the lackeys of leviathan unions they themselves created. We rely on the army to protect us and our greens.         
	Saswati Mukerji              
	I will never, never, never let the government grab the Maidan.         
	Reshma Vaswani              
	Not only Subhas Chakraborty but also his party colleagues want control of the greens. Should this happen, the Maidan will become part of Calcuttas history. Let us not forget the principal opposition party is also silent on the issue, when they are known to oppose anything the state pursues. It is ominous that matters of public wellbeing seem to rest only with the court.         
	Suman S. Dasgupta               
	I fail to understand why the transport minister is having this urge to grab the Maidan when so many other issues need his attention urgently.         
	Ananya Pal

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sale or no sale, happy Moms Day
                                                                                                               Sale or no sale, happy Moms Day

	Its that time of the year again  soon it will be Mothers Day. Sale signs are up on shop windows, restaurants are announcing special lunches, and radio jockeys have started sending out sentimental messages.         
	The second Sunday of May is the Day to celebrate mothers. I have often thought of the day as yet another commercial enterprise: cards are bought; flowers are delivered; and womens gift items boost the sale of many businesses. But I started noticing something else over the years. In America, this is also a day that brings the whole family together.         
	It is hard to imagine that for generations grown up on a steady diet of television shows like Baywatch and Santa Barbara, families are the centre of life. From the kids who leave home at 16 in Hollywood films, to the steady stream of family-less, ruthless protagonists that dominate TV serials, family life is often ignored in popular culture.         
	But in reality, families dominate everyday scenes of American life  from parents with toddlers in shopping malls, to the young mother taking her baby out in the stroller on a sunny afternoon, to the father waking up early to take his kids to swimming class on a Saturday.         
	And at the centre of all family activity is the lady of the house. World War II brought women, many of them mothers, into the workforce. The feminist movement opened more doors, and somewhere along the way a new breed was born, the superwoman.         
	Constantly juggling, I see these women every day: dropping off the kids at school and then rushing to work; attending meetings as well as the childrens doctor appointments; or lugging big bags so that they can spend a couple of hours more at home.         
	Women today make hard choices every day. When a qualified lawyer with a Harvard education announced on national television that her main job was to be mom-in-chief, many were surprised. Michelle Obama wanted to make sure her daughters would continue to have some semblance of a normal childhood in spite of their relocation to the White House. There are those who step off the career track to become mothers. They lose out on promotions or plum assignments, or are unable to get their old jobs back. Many of those who never chose to work are going back as their husbands get laid off. A bad economy changes everything.         
	But did my mothers generation have it any easier? Perhaps they did not need to know terms like work-life balance, but they too carried a heavy burden. The lines were more demarcated then, men had careers, and office pressures and incomes, and women had families.         
	This often meant mothers were solely responsible for the upbringing of the children. They moved wherever their husbands took them, wherever fathers were posted, struggling with strange languages and cultures, making friends out of strangers, all to ensure her household ran smoothly. They may not have had to deal with long conference calls, but the physical and emotional well-being of their children was in their hands, a tough responsibility by any account.         
	Like every year this year on May 10, driveways in my neighbourhood will be full of cars. Daughters and sons will drive back home with their families, or plan elaborate Mothers Day lunches at local restaurants. TV anchors will talk about how many tonnes of flowers were sold, and newspaper will do stories on the most popular gifts for mothers this year when the economy is particularly bad.         
	But maybe this year I will give my cynicism a miss, and finally acknowledge that it doesnt matter what sales purpose the day serves, appreciating mothers can never really be commercial or excessive.

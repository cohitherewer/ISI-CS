The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cosy niche for creative pursuits
                                                                                                               Cosy niche for creative pursuits
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Spandan, which promotes theatre, films and fine arts in the city, has unveiled an alternative space for all things creative.        
	Located in the heart of a busy neighbourhood, the 400sq ft performance space on the first floor of 87 Park Street can be used for organising small shows, readings, performances and adda on any topic, including art, theatre, music, sports, fashion, food and spirituality.        
	The idea is to have small intimate gatherings in a cultural space where one can enjoy a performance in a compact atmosphere that also provides for an opportunity to interact with artistes, said Renu Roy, the founder-director of Spandan.         
	The high-ceilinged 50-seat room that previously served as an art gallery will continue to function as an art exhibition arena where the audience can enjoy works of established and aspiring artists before settling down for a recital or a talk.        
	Spandan sources said flexible seating and staging provisions made the space ideal for small-scale events. The venue also provides parking space for 25 cars. Were looking at both established and aspiring artistes to come, participate or use this space for crossover value. Apart from music, dance, book launches, poetry and play-reading sessions were also looking at world movie screenings if the project gains momentum. If that happens, we might shift a particular event to an adjacent room which can seat 80 -people, added Roy.        
	To set the tone, the inauguration last Saturday featured an Indian classical recital by two child artistes  Prahaban Basu and Sreejan Deb  as a tribute to Ustad Ali Akbar Khan. Next up is The Elephant Man, a play in Hindi to be performed by Sree on Independence Day. We plan to host at least 25 events every year. Its a non-profit venture and events will be organised in aid of charities, said Roy. All one needs to do is register their contact details with Spandan to become a member and receive regular updates on the roster.

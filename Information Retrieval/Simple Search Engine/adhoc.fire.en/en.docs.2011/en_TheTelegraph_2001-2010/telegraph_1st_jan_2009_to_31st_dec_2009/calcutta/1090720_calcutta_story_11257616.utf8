	Jyoti Basu went home on Sunday evening after spending eight days in AMRI Hospitals, Salt Lake.        
	The former chief minister was carried out of the hospital on a stretcher around 6pm and taken to his Indira Bhavan in an ambulance.        
	Covered in a white sheet from neck down, he looked pale while being carried to the ambulance from the cabin he was in and hardly opened his eyes. Basus confidential secretary Joykrishna Ghosh and daughter-in-law Rakhi Basu said he was in good spirits after reaching home.        
	He asked how my son Panku (Subhojyoti Basu) was, said Rakhi.         
	He is feeling much better after reaching home and spoke to me after a long time. He asked how things were at my home, said Ghosh.        
	A cardiac monitor, defibrillator, oxygen cylinders and other equipment found in Intensive Care Units have been set up at Indira Bhavan to ensure the 95-year-old does not face a crisis like on July 12, when he lost consciousness while brushing his teeth. Doctors and nurses will monitor him round the clock.        
	Before leaving the hospital, Basu brought a smile on the faces of the doctors and other employees. You took good care of me and now I am going home. Thank you all, Basu told the hospital staff. He also arranged for laddoos to be distributed to them.         
	The medical board constituted for his treatment met this morning, reviewed his condition and decided to discharge him today, D.N. Agarwal, the executive director of AMRI Hospitals said.        
	According to CPM sources, Basu had been insisting for the past few days that he be shifted to Indira Bhavan.         
	He has been prescribed normal diet like he was having in the hospital.         
	He had a banana, a papaya and porridge for breakfast. For lunch he had soft rice, fish and boiled vegetable, said an official. Basu slept through the afternoon.         
	Doctors treating him said he would be able to gradually return to normal life. He is not allowed to sit for more than 15 to 20 minutes at a stretch as we want to ensure he doesnt become unconscious again, said a doctor.        
	Basu used to sit and read newspapers after breakfast. He also used to sit for several minutes after a nap following lunch. He hardly walks.         
	Basu will be advised to stand with support for brief periods after a week. Later he will be asked to walk slowly in the house for a short while, added the doctor.

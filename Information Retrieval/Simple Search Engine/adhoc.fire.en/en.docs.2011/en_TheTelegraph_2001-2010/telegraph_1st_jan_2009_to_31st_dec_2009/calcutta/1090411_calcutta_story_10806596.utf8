                A. Chowdhury, 30, was arrested at the airport after a 9mm bullet was found in his hand baggage on Friday. Chowdhury, a Bangalore-based software professional, was scheduled to take an Air India flight to his hometown, Silchar, at 1.05pm. The bullet was detected during the baggage check and Chowdhury was unable to produce documents allowing him to fly with live ammunition. The bullet matched with ammunition issued to police, army and paramilitary personnel. Chowdhury said it belonged to his father.

                The civic body cancelled the trade licence of Mukti World on Friday. The mall-cum-multiplex near Ballygunge Phari was sealed on Thursday evening. After we demolished parts of the top floor of Mukti World, the promoters moved the high court. The court appointed a special officer to inspect the site and submit a report. Even before the report was submitted, the company reconstructed the demolished portion, said a civic official. Talks are on and we expect to resume operations in a day or two, said a Mukti World official.     Diesel generators can no longer be used to power cellphone towers, the state environment department has announced. Towers that are being run by diesel generators, which cause air and sound pollution, will have to switch to battery or solar panels for captive power from May next year.

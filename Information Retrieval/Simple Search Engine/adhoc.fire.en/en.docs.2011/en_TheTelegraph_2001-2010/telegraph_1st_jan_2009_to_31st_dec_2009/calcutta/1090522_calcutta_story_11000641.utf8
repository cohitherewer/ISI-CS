	Burglars broke into a flat on Rifle Range Road, less than a kilometre from the chief ministers Palm Avenue residence, early on Thursday and decamped with cash and jewellery worth Rs 4 lakh.        
	Police said the burglars entered the first-floor flat at 16/1 Rifle Range Road around midnight while the residents, related to a senior officer in the burglary section of the detective department, were attending a relatives wedding in Babughat.        
	No arrest has yet been made but we have detained two local goons. We are interrogating them to track down the criminals, said an investigating officer of Karaya police station.        
	Arun Trivedi, 48, a teacher at Army Public School, Ballygunge, wife Usha and sons Dhiraj and Harsh were shocked to find the lock of the main wooden door of their flat broken when they returned around 4.30am.        
	The two bedrooms were ransacked and the four steel almirahs broken open. Around Rs 55,000 and jewellery worth Rs 3.5 lakh were missing, said Dhiraj, an MBA aspirant.        
	My mother has been crying since morning. The cops inspected our flat and assured us that the burglars would be arrested, but we dont have much faith in them, he said.        
	The family has been living in the flat for the past two decades.        
	The area has become unsafe. Criminals roam around at night. My motorbike and a bicycle were stolen last year. The situation has gone out of hand because of slack vigil by cops, said Bapi Sarkar, a trader who lives on the second floor of the building.        
	The chief ministers neighbourhood has witnessed a number of burglaries in the past couple of years. The police had identified two gangs  led by Bangladeshi nationals Salim and Ashraf  which were reportedly behind most burglaries in the area.        
	The sleuths suspect the gang-members are based in Ghutiari Sharif and Canning, South 24-Parganas.        
	Last year, the police had arrested Buddha and Bapi Hati, who were involved in a string of burglaries in Park Circus, while they were loitering in the Palm Avenue neighbourhood.        
	The duo, from Midnapore, were staying in a slum in Park Circus.

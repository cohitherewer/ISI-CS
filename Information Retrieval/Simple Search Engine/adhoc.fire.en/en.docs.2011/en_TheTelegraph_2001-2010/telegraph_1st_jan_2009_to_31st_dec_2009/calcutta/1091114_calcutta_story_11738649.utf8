          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Manjari Nayak, a 15-year-old who had to be hospitalised after being allegedly tortured by her employers last week, deposed before the sixth judicial magistrate in the Alipore court on Friday afternoon.        
	The girls statement was recorded under IPC Section 164. Prior to that, Manjari was taken to SSKM Hospital for an ossification test to ascertain her age, said an officer of Alipore police station.         
	The court directed the police to send Manjari to a government-aided home on Eliot Road. On November 7, Manjaris employers  Shree Prakash Mishra, 38, and his wife Madhuri Das  were arrested for allegedly torturing her at their Alipore home for a few days. Mishra is a deputy general manager of the Reserve Bank of India.         
	The couple were charged with voluntarily causing grievous hurt and released on bail. Cops later booked them under the Child Labour Act, which makes hiring children below 14 years illegal.         
	The police said they would soon file a chargesheet in court.        
	Mishra lives in a central government housing complex on New Road in Alipore with his wife and two sons. A preliminary probe revealed the duo had employed Manjari, a resident of Rourkela in Orissa, around five years ago.        
	Mishras father is a retired IPS officer. We are surprised that the family has been accused of such inhuman torture, the officer added.        
	On Friday, Manjari was discharged from CMRI, where she was admitted on November 7, and taken to the Alipore court. Child rights activists said the girl shouldnt have been discharged. She has wounds on her back, her hand is in a plaster and she has fever, said Amita Sen of the child welfare committee.

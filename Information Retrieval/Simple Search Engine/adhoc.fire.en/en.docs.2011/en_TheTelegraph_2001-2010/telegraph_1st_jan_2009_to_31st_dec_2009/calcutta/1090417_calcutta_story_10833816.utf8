The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cops fret over fee fracas
                                                                                                               Cops fret over fee fracas
  - Pre-poll protests at schools prompt knock on state door          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	The frequent protests and roadblocks by parents over the fee hike in private schools have prompted police to seek the education departments intervention in the matter.        
	The standoff between the parents and the school managements can snowball into a serious law-and-order problem. We will soon meet officials of the education department and request them to try and resolve the crisis, said a senior police officer.        
	Parents have blocked Diamond Harbour road thrice in the past week demanding a rollback.... The issue needs to be addressed immediately as our men are busy with election duty, the officer added.        
	Officials in the school education department, however, did not hold out much hope for an early solution to the problem. A large number of the private schools that have raised fees are run by missionaries and enjoy the freedom to fix their fees. We can only request them to reconsider their decision but with the general elections round the corner, we cant even do that at this stage, said an official.        
	The cops decided to knock on the education departments door after a meeting organised by Ekbalpore police on Thursday between the managements of three schools  Loyola High, St Pauls and St Teresas  and the parents failed to table a solution.        
	The principals of the three schools made it clear that the hike could not be withdrawn if they were to pay their teachers and other employees according to the fifth pay commissions recommendation.        
	We now have no option but to file a PIL in the high court, challenging the steep hike in tuition fees, said Subir Pal, whose daughter studies in Class I at St Pauls.        
	The heads of the three schools, however, offered to waive the tuition fees of students from underprivileged families.        
	Usually, all missionary schools help poor and needy students. We told the parents that the benefit would be extended to more students but the parents have to approach us individually, said a spokesman for Loyola High School.         
	Loyola High, St Pauls and St Teresas  all functioning under the Calcutta Diocese of the Roman Catholic church  have raised their fees by more than 60 per cent.        
	The fee row followed the states decision to accept the pay panels report, which had suggested a 32-36 per cent hike in the salaries of government employees, including the teachers of aided schools. The rules state that all private schools are required to pay on a par with aided schools.

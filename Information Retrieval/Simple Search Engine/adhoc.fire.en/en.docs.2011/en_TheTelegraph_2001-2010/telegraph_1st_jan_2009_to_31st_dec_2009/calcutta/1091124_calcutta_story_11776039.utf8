	The high court on Monday asked police to help a 70-year-old man, who is allegedly being tortured by his two sons, live peacefully in his Thakurpukur house with his wife, daughter and two grandchildren.         
	Sunil Kumar Saha, a retired central government employee, had moved the court against his sons.        
	The sons are directed to spare at least two rooms in the building for their parents and sister, said Justice P.K. Chattopadhyay.        
	After Sahas daughter moved into his two-storey house with her two girls, his sons demanded the property be transferred to their names, said P.K. Roy, who represented the petitioner.        
	When he refused, his sons and their wives started torturing him and the other members of the family, Roy added.        
	The judge asked the police to file a compliance report by December 2.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Register rein on schools
                                                                                                               Register rein on schools
  - Fee-hike protests prompt govt to mull writ for control          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	The state government is planing to bring all private schools under its scanner in the wake of the fee hike protests that the state cabinet discussed on Thursday.        
	The school education department wants all private schools to obtain a registration certificate, failing which the campuses will have to be shut down. The registration will have to be renewed every three years.        
	While applying for registration and also during renewal, the managements will have to send a factfile to the government, stating the pay scale of the teachers, tuition fees, number of students and the quality of infrastructure, among other details.        
	The government is not empowered to act against private schools, especially those run by Christian missionaries, even if they violate rules. If the new proposal materialises, we will have some control over their functioning, said a senior official in the state school education department.        
	The government had made a similar move two years ago, when it set up a 13-member watchdog committee following complaints that the fees of several ICSE and CBSE schools did not match their academic standards and infrastructure.        
	Acting on the panels recommendation, the government had written to all private schools seeking information about various aspects of their administration. Hardly any school responded to the questionnaire.        
	The government hopes the new move would succeed as the schools, according to the proposal, would not be allowed to function in the absence of the registration certificate.        
	The state cabinet on Thursday took up the issue of tuition fee hike in private schools that has sparked protests by parents across the city. The schools claim that the Fifth Pay Commissions award raising salaries of the teachers had forced them to hike the fees.        
	A section of ministers at the meeting said the government should find out whether the schools are really paying revised salaries to the teachers, post-hike.        
	We cannot take drastic action against any private school because that will jeopardise the future of many students. We are working for an amicable solution, said school education minister Partha Dey.        
	The issue will also be discussed with representatives of the Anglo-Indian board of the state government.

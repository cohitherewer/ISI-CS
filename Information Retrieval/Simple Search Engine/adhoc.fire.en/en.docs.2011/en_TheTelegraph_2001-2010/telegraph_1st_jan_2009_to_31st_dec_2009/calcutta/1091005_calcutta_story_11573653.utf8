The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pandal same, puja different
                                                                                                               Pandal same, puja different
  - City creations for Durga sold to organisers elsewhere          OUR BUREAU                          The pandal of Dum Dum Park Bharat Chakra which will be reused for Kali and Jagaddhatri pujas. (Pradip Sanyal)                                        
	If you go pandal-hopping this Jagaddhatri puja in Chandernagore in end-October (Saptami is on 25th), you might mistake yourself to have travelled back in time to Durga puja 2009 in Calcutta. In a trend growing by the year, most of the citys big budget pandals are making their way to suburban pujas, to be reconstructed piece by piece at a new venue miles away. Even the lights are being sold off.        
	Negotiations with the organisers from the districts start as the pandals near completion post-Mahalaya. In most cases, it is the artiste who does these transactions. Our artiste said he could barely make any profit so we allowed him to resell the pandal, says convener Pijush Banerjee of Mitali in Kankurgachhi, which was crowned Model Puja in CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja 2009. The budget for the pandal and idol this year was Rs 5.25 lakh.        
	The sale price is barely a sixth of the Calcutta rate but the extra income helps the decorator, says Prashanta Pal, whose team shaped five big-budget pujas. Four of the five  Palli Saradiya, Bosepukur Talbagan, Dum Dum Park Tarun Sangha and Lake Town Pradeep Sangha  will be making their way to Chandernagore. The resell clause is worked into Pals contract. I have been selling pandals for eight years now.        
	Pranab Mondal of Charmandirtala Jagaddhatri puja, which has bought Pals Dum Dum Park creation, points out that the trend is on the rise for eight-nine years. All these years, the focus in Chandernagore was on lights. But competitions have started for pandals, too. In such a short time after Durga puja, it is impossible for top artistes to create something new. Nor can we afford an original creation by them. It works out best if we transport an existing work. Barely five per cent people here would have seen Calcutta pujas to detect the duplication. And people from Calcutta come here mostly to see our immersion processions, he says.        
	Some organisers are savvy enough to do the reselling themselves. The Shibmandir puja committee on Lake Temple Road made a windfall this year with their pandal made of banana bark, leaves and bamboo shoots. A Chandernagore committee has bought the structure for Rs 1.5 lakh for Jagaddhatri puja. Our artiste Subrata Banerjee would be going over before the pandal is shifted, said Partha Ghosh, an organiser.         
	Low and medium-budget pujas from Behala and Barisha are also out to make a quick buck and it is not just Chandernagore where the pandals are headed. This year our pandal was modelled on a birds cage made of plaster of Paris. A Kali puja committee from Budge Budge has struck a deal with us, said Tarak Mukherjee of Barisha Tarun Sangha.         
	The mandap of the Manicktala Chaltabagan Lohapatty puja, modelled on a temple, will be seen at a Siliguri Kali puja. They are taking our pandal for the fifth year now, says Jagadish Chandra Das, the decorator. Around Rs 2.5 lakh has been quoted and the money will go to the decorator, not the artiste. I earn my share only the first time, says artiste Sutana Maity.        
	Das has also resold the other pandals he made. The Salt Lake BG Block pandal, replicating a monastery, is going to Seoraphuli for Rs 2 lakh while the Singhi Park pandal is off to Durgapur for Rs 2 lakh.        
	But as Partha Chatterjee of Dum Dum Park Bharat Chakra points out, the negotiations can be an extra headache. Last year, we bought the pandal materials ourselves and negotiated the sale too. Just the dismantling cost us Rs 30,000 while the artiste made us buy more materials than were needed, Chatterjee recalls.         
	Yet, new pujas are joining the recycle trade. In a first for the block, the pandal based on Mayan civilisation in Salt Lakes HA Block may travel to Chandernagore if the puja committee green lights the offer.        
	If the pandals are going mostly to Chandernagore, the lights are going elsewhere. Says Babu Pal, a light artiste from Chandernagore whose work lit up the Sreebhumi Sporting Club puja. He will get to showcase the comic book heroes He-Man, Superman and Tarzan at a Kali puja in Howrah.

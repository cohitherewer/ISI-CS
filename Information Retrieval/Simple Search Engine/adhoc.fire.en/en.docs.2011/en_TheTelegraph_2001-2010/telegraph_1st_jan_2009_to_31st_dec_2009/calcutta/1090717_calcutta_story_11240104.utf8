                      Celebration of love and the rains                    Tagore composed some of his immortal lyrics in celebration of the rainy season. In some of them, traditional, folk tunes impart the philosophical essence of life evoked by the rains. While some songs are colourful and cheerful, others portray the melancholy and gloom of our minds when clouds heap upon clouds. In such times, the mind is filled with memories of days gone by, often intensifying ones longing for ones beloved. Hosted by Rani, Megher Pore Megh, features rendition of Tagore songs on monsoon and love by Shreya Guhathakurta and his poems by Bratati Bandyopadhyay. It attempts to help re-introduce and revive an aspect of Tagores creativity that connoisseurs of music would surely enjoy and appreciate. It also tries to arouse new thought and interest on the subject of Tagores songs and poems, while reminding the audience of the richness they have unfailingly carried through generations.                  lEvent: An evening of Tagore songs and poems by Shreya Guhathakurta and Bratati Bandyopadhyay lWhen: Today at 7 pm lWhere: G.D.

										      eyewitness                        A work by Sanjib Sen				                           
	Beautiful catalogues are rarely made in India. But one should not be misled by them. The catalogue of the exhibition of photographs of nudes by Sanjib Sen at Ganges Art gallery is actually better than the show itself.         
	These are highly stylised photographs of a naked woman with arms and legs outstretched to create angular silhouettes. A particular blow-up may remind one of Kafkas short story in which a man turns overnight into an insect. Here the model is transformed into a giant preying mantis.         
	Some of the close-ups that minutely document the epidermis and the fine down on it are more interesting. In another good shot, the gaze of the lens travels across her undulating torso up to her pubic region. The other attempts at turning the folds of her flesh and various limbs into craggy terrain and promontories are rather cliched.        
	Sanjib Sens experiments with colour are disastrous. Shot behind a golden orange sheet of plastic or glass, the woman turns into a phantom striking varied poses, including what is possibly a headstand. Photography at its worst.              
	The last week gave reviewers a bad time. Mon Art gallerys exhibition mounted after a longish break makes one wonder why it bothered to do this at all. The gallerist has brought together various artists who are like unskilled labour in this rarefied field. Watercolourists trained here are usually quite talented. But the terraces series exhibited here shows no evidence of that. The typical views of Calcutta could have been inspired by picture postcards.         
	However, Kaushik Rahas watercolour sketches are better. He, too, makes cityscapes but is skilled enough to suggest more than he actually paints. The artists have tried their hand at everything from photographic realism to abstract. There is another artist who has tried to imitate Gaganendranath Tagore with cubist architectural forms and shadows. But he has produced only bad copies. The most amazing exhibit is the depiction of Michael Jackson doing the Moonwalk. Does the gallerist take herself seriously?       SOUMITRA DAS

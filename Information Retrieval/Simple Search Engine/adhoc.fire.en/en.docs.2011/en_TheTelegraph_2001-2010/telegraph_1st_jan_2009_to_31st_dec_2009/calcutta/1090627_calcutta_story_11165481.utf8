                      Rediscovering the silk route                    In 1996, filmmaker Goutam Ghose led an international filming crew across the Himalayas to discover one of the most beautiful and remote regions on Earth. This 30-member expedition also sought to revive contact and initiate academic exchanges among India, China and the new Islamic republics of central Asia. The team made a documentary, Beyond the Himalayas, on their experiences in the mountainous region, which was telecast on Discovery Channel as a five-part series and bagged the Best Documentary award at the 42nd Filmfare Awards in 1997. Based on a script by Ayn Rasheed Khan, it retraces the famous silk trade routes of Chinese Turkestan, Tibet and Mount Everest, capturing its beauty, culture, history and heritage. Each episodic chapter of the film reveals the people, lifestyle and history of a land steeped in legend and mystery. In a series of personal journeys, the director and his companions discover hidden places and ways of life that have hardly changed since the days of Marco Polo. This evening, Weavers Studio Centre for the Arts hosts the screening of The Other Side of the Mountain and In Search of the Buddha, two historically rich and absorbing episodes from this five-part documentary.                    Event: Screening of two episodes from Goutam Ghoses Beyond the Himalayas When: Today; 6 pm - 8 pm Where: Weavers Studio Centre for the Arts, 94 Ballygunge Place

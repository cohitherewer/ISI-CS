                      Reflections of reality                    Guided by a keen sense of observation, perception and appreciation of the world around them, artists Santanu Maity, Amritah Sen and Sumona Jana build unique artistic domains that allow them to evolve a fantastic, dream-like state of being and at the same time remaining embedded with reality. Inspired by the philosophy of Tagore, Santanu Maity (a painting by him appears here) creates thought-provoking works that are born of his ability to see ordinary, mundane objects in a different light. Though abstract in design, they are touched by his acute sense of analytical observation. Amritah Sen appears to be introspecting upon her own life in the present body of works. They convey a feeling of stopping midway along ones path to look back and reflect on the past. Sometimes, they give the impression of an incomplete, unfulfilled life. A printmaker with a difference, Sumona Jana portrays her disillusionment of life lived in an urban jungle. Loneliness, rivalry and lack of empathy in modern urban life find expression in her works. Significantly, the artist also appears interested to escape or change the insenstivity of her environment, with the negative black space of her canvas often giving way to an imaginative universe of peace.                  Event: An exhibition of recent paintings by Santanu Maity, Amritah Sen and Sumona Jana When: Till July 31; 11 am - 7 pm Where: Galerie 88, 28B Shakespeare Sarani

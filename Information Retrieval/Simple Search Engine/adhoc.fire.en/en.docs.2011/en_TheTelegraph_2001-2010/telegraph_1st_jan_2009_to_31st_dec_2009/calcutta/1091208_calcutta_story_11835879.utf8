The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Grazing spot for cattle
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Grazing spot for cattle
          ONTHESPOT - KK TAGORE STREET                          The garbage vat in KK Tagore Street. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                                  
	The residents of KK Tagore Street are living with an overflowing garbage vat in their midst, more than 40 years old, that is increasing in size.         
	The open vat is located on the edge of Tarasundari Park, and the litter dumped into it spills out of the demarcated area, dirtying KK Tagore Street and slowing down traffic. Added to that is the stink and the cattle from nearby khatals for whom the vat, measuring 25ft x 10ft, is a favourite grazing spot.         
	About 35-40 tonnes of waste from residential houses, guesthouses and sweet shops of wards 21 to 25 is dumped into the vat every day. Though the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) claims it cleans the vat daily, residents complain that mounds of rubbish are always left behind, which are later scattered by crows and cows.         
	A shout away from the vat is Sri Vaikunth Nath Devasthan, the 48-year-old temple that is forced to put up with the squalor as are the residents of the area.         
	We have devotees coming in from south India and at times from outside the country. The vat is a sorry sight and it stinks. The area should be kept clean, said Krishna Bharati, the manager of the temple.         
	We have to fight swarms of mosquitoes. When the civic workers load the litter on lorries, some of it falls on the road, which is never picked up. Besides, there is no specific time for dumping or clearing the garbage. Repeated complaints have served no purpose, said Bala Shankar Roy, who runs a transport business in the area.         
	Civicspeak: The CMC pay-loaders remove the garbage from the vat every day around 11am. Sometimes when the lorries are late, we fail to collect the entire trash as lorries cannot be parked for long in such a congested area. The residents, too, should ensure that they drop the litter into the vat and not outside it, said an official of the solid waste management cell of borough IV.         
	Traffic copspeak: The vat should ideally be cleared early in the morning, but on most days it is cleared around 11am, which is peak traffic hour. Since KK Tagore Street is not very wide, the lorries take up a lot of space, which leads to traffic snarls on this stretch. The congestion affects Posta on one side and Rabindra Sarani on the other. It takes us about 25 to 30 minutes to clear the bottleneck. Besides, the CMC doesnt clear the garbage on Sundays, so the mound reaches the road by Monday, further narrowing the road space, said an officer of Jorabagan traffic guard.

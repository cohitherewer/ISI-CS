The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hic! City happy to have a Hangover   Holly with Bolly feel
                                                                                                               Hic! City happy to have a Hangover
  - Hollywood laughathon manages a Bollywood run at the box office despite competition          PRIYANKA ROY                          The Hangover is running to packed houses in Week 5                                        
	What does it take for a Hollywood film to enjoy a Bollywood run at the city box office? A Hangover.        
	Non-stop action with punches and punch lines galore is getting even Bolly addicts to cross over for a bellyful of Holly laughs at plexes. Despite a Bollywood biggie every Friday over the past month  from New York to Luck  and the towering presence of Harry Potter, a phenomenal 75 per cent occupancy in Week 5 has ensured that The Hangover  a riotous comedy about the mad antics of a bachelor party in Las Vegas  is the little big film of the season.        
	Since its release, The Hangover has already done business worth $100 million in the international market. Across India, the film has notched up Rs 6.8 crore. This is huge considering that we havent dubbed the film into other languages and have released just 42 prints. Barring The Dark Knight and Harry Potter films, Hangover has been one of our biggest, says Denzil Dias, the deputy managing director of Warner Bros Pictures, producers of the film.        
	With rip-roaring performances  led by Zach Galifianakis as Alan, and including Mike Tyson and his truant tiger  The Hangover has Calcutta hooked. Starting off with 12 shows in its opening week, the film still enjoys five shows in Week 5, a rare feat for a Hollywood film.        
	Hangover has no logic but is still an absolutely brilliant entertainer. I had a huge smile on my face when I walked out of the film. I would love to watch it several times over, says actress June, already hunting for a DVD of the film.        
	With Bollywood producers queuing up to remake the film into Hindi, The Hangover has managed to plug the Holly-Bolly gap. The film has a very Bollywood feel. I have watched it twice already, says college student Radhika Sengupta, a Bolly loyalist.        
	The Agarwal gang from Ballygunge Circular Road broke Bollywood protocol this weekend after being assured of a laughathon by friends who had watched Hangover, and ended up liking it better than Kambakkht Ishq.                          
	It was wilder than the wildest Bollywood caper. We were discussing how the four friends in the film could easily have been Govinda, Akshay Kumar, Riteish Deshmukh and Boman Irani. The crowd at INOX (Forum) on Saturday night was laughing non-stop, says Sunil Agarwal, 36, who went with family and friends.        
	So, despite stiff competition from Holly and Bolly, The Hangover has been doing good business for five weeks at INOX. The two Fame plexes have also registered extraordinary footfalls for The Hangover, with the weekend shows going nearly full.        
	Word-of-mouth publicity and a lot of me too moments have contributed to the popularity of the film. The Hangover is almost a cult film now with many trooping in for a second or a third watch, says Dias.        
	No wonder they are planning Hangover 2  and Calcutta will definitely be waiting.

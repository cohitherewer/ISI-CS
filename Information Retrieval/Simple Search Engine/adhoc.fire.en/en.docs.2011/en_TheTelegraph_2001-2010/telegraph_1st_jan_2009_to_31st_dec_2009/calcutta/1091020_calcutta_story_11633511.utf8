The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Seat rejig to ease airport wait woes
                                                                                                               Seat rejig to ease airport wait woes
          SANJAY MANDAL                                        The entrance to Calcutta airport.   A Telegraph picture      
	A survey highlighting passenger grievances over seating arrangements at Calcutta airports domestic terminal has prompted the authorities to draw up a plan to overhaul the check-in and the ground-floor security hold areas.        
	Once the plan is implemented the security hold will occupy more space, eating into the check-in area from where all chairs will be removed. Officials said the seating space crunch in the check-in area would be more than compensated by increasing the number of chairs in the security hold.        
	The proposal has been sent to the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security for approval, airport director R. Srinivasan said on Monday.        
	The proposal, aimed at easing congestion in the lounge, is likely to be approved, a senior bureau official told Metro from Delhi. The authorities wont have to deploy additional security personnel for the change in lay-out of the domestic terminal, which records an average daily footfall of 8,000-9,000.        
	The authorities want to increase the security hold space by 300sq m.        
	Now, a flier waits in the check-in area after collecting his/her boarding pass for announcement for security check. This causes severe congestion in the lounge, said a security officer at the airport.        
	In the new scheme of things, there will be no announcement for security check. A passenger, after clearing check-in procedures, will immediately leave for the security hold where he will wait till boarding is announced, he explained.        
	According to the proposal, all scanning booths and hand baggage X-ray counters in the security hold will be relocated. All five X-ray counters for scanning hand baggages will be on the ground floor. Now, two such counters are on the first floor, said an airport official.        
	A passenger who will board the flight from the first floor will wait there after completing the security formalities on the ground floor. There will be enough chairs in the first-floor waiting space, the official added.        
	All shops in the check-in area, including the food stalls, will be shifted inside the security hold, where a passenger will spend the maximum time before boarding a flight.        
	The airport authorities drew up the revamp plan on the basis of the report of a quarterly survey on passenger preferences for the period ending September 30.        
	Around 70 per cent of the fliers surveyed expressed satisfaction over the facilities at the city airport, against 54.6 per cent at Chennai airport.        
	But passengers want the seating arrangements, cleanliness of toilets, baggage delivery system and availability of trolleys to improve.        
	A senior official said: We are now trying to improve the seating facilities. As for the other problem points, we will soon chalk up upgrade plans.        
	The poor state of infrastructure at the airport was exposed on Puja days when most flights went full and passenger queues extended till the entrance during peak hours.        
	Fliers were arriving on time but the airports passenger-handling capacity proved inadequate, delaying flights by 20 to 30 minutes on an average during rush hours.

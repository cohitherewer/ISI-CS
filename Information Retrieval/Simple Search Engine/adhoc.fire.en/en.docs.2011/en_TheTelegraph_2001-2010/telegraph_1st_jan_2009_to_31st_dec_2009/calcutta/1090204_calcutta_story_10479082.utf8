	The next time companies want to harness emerging technologies, Indias best technical minds will only be a click away.        
	IIT Kharagpur on Tuesday launched a website to showcase its research acumen to the industry.         
	The portal will provide technical details of technologies that are ready for transfer and serve as a platform for the institutes expertise in various fields, said Yashwanth Reddy, a student head of the Technology Transfer Group.        
	The group, a student initiative guided by faculty members, built the website. It will house a database of more than 500 faculty members and student inventors working in 19 departments and centres, covering over 1,000 research areas.        
	The website classifies research projects under eight broad sectors like infrastructure, physical sciences, chemical sciences, life sciences and mathematics.        
	Technologies ready for transfer are mainly in the areas of biotech, life sciences and nano technology.        
	The main aim of the website is to promote IIT Kharagpur as a research consultancy and facilitate interaction between inventors and prospective buyers in the industry, said Reddy.        
	Another academia-industry collaboration, Microsoft Centre for Excellence in Intellectual Property and Technology Policy, was launched on the IIT Kharagpur campus on Tuesday.        
	So far we have been renting out IQ to other countries. It is time we moved up the chin and start creating intellectual property. The centre for excellence is a response to that movement, said Rakesh Bakshi, the associate general counsel of Microsoft India.        
	The centre, located within the Rajiv Gandhi School of Intellectual Property Rights, will boost the schools attempt to educate professionals from technological backgrounds in intellectual property rights laws.        
	The centre will offer scholarships to students, run a foundation course on continuing legal education (CLE) principles for the industry, academia and the government, and conduct seminars and workshops for policy-makers, said Madhusudan Chakraborty, the deputy director of IIT Kharagpur.        
	 Microsoft will invest about Rs 66 lakh over three years in the centre.

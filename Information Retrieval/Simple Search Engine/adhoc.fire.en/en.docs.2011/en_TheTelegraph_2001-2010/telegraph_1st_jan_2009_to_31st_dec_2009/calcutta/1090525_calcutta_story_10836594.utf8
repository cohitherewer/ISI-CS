The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Card with medical past
                                                                                                               Card with medical past
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A voluntary organisation in Hatkhola, north Calcutta, will distribute identity cards to citizens bearing their contact details and medical history.        
	The organisation, Medical Bank, has tied up with police to introduce the card.        
	The card will have the photograph, name, address, age, phone number, blood group and medical history of the cardholder. When someone falls ill on the road, it becomes difficult to contact his/her family. The card will help in such cases, said D. Ashis, the general secretary of Medical Bank.         
	The medical history on the card will also help doctors understand the requirements of the patient, he said. Initially 1 lakh cards will be distributed free at railway stations, markets and bus terminus.         
	Those willing to enrol with the organisation for the card can call 9831062157.

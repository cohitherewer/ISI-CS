The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Poll breather for engineering fee hike
                                                                                                               Poll breather for engineering fee hike

	Education in private engineering colleges of Bengal could be costlier by nearly 45 per cent from the next academic session, if not the current one.        
	The 55-odd private engineering colleges in the state have proposed a hike of Rs 19,000 per student, which works out to an annual fee of Rs 60,000. The fee is Rs 41,000 at present.        
	 We expect a notification on the fee hike to be issued after the Lok Sabha polls, said Anik Chowdhury, a senior official of the Techno India Group that runs several engineering colleges.         
	Private engineering colleges had raised the demand after the University Grants Commission (UGC) recommended a 70 per cent increase in the salaries of college and university teachers across the country.         
	Kisan Kejriwal of MCKV Institute of Engineering and Management said an upward revision of fees was long overdue. Given the fact that salaries of teachers have to be raised by nearly 70 per cent, we wont be able to run our institution smoothly even after raising the fee to Rs 60,000 a year.        
	Once the UGC recommendations take effect, the minimum monthly salary of a lecturer in a private college will shoot up from Rs 12,000 to Rs 21,000.        
	Most private institutes have urged the government to announce the fee hike with immediate effect so that they can meet the additional salary burden.         
	An official of the higher education department said the government had accepted the revised UGC scales but Delhi was yet to give the green signal.        
	 But the state government has assured all college and university teachers that the UGC-recommended scales will be definitely implemented. Private engineering institutes will also have to adhere to the revised scales once the government increases the salaries of teachers of state-aided colleges and universities, he added.        
	On the implementation of a fee hike in private engineering colleges, the official said it was in the final stage of review.         
	Some institutions had demanded that fees be raised to Rs 80,000 annually. However, given the spate of complaints from guardians and students about infrastructure and faculty in private engineering colleges, the government is considering grading them and fixing fees accordingly, he revealed        
	The Supreme Court has vested state governments with the right to regulate the fees charged by private engineering colleges.

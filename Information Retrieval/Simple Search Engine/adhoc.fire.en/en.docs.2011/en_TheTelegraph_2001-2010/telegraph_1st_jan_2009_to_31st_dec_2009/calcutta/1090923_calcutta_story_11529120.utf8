                                                                                                               Duo held for link with ISI accused
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two youths were arrested late on Monday for their alleged links with Jyoti Rana, who is in custody on the charge of recruiting people for Pakistans Inter Services Intelligence.        
	A team from Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport police station picked up Bablu Shaw, 25, and Kamlesh Shaw, 30, from their Cossipore houses after they went to meet Rana at the Barrackpore court on Monday. The duo have been remanded in judicial custody till October 16.        
	Sleuths said Bablu and Kamlesh used to fake passports and other identity documents for Rana.        
	We kept a watch on the Shaws as they were chatting suspiciously with Rana and making phone calls at regular intervals. Our men followed them to their Cossipore houses before picking them up, said an officer investigating the case.        
	We are trying to find out whether the two have any link with the ISI. They are old hands at forging documents, said Rahul Shrivastava, the superintendent of North 24-Parganas police.        
	Rana, alias Mehrunnisa, was arrested at the city airport after she arrived from Bangkok on Sunday. A look-out notice had been issued against her by the Foreigners Regional Registration Office.

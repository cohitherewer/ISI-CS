The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Apex court grants bail to Todis
                                                                                                               Apex court grants bail to Todis
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT IN NEW DELHI                                            
	The Supreme Court on Friday granted bail to Ashok and Pradip Todi in the Rizwanur Rahman death case but the brothers, who have been in custody for more than a month, will have to wait till Saturday evening at least to step out of Presidency jail.        
	Legal experts said the original certified copy of the apex court order would have to be produced in the Calcutta Metropolitan Magistrates court, where the Rizwanur case was filed. Only then will the magistrate ask the jail authorities to release the Todis.        
	Its expected that the formalities would be over by Saturday afternoon and the accused would be released in the evening, said lawyer Sailendu Rakshit.        
	While granting bail, the Supreme Court bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan ordered the Todis not to contact witnesses, try to dissuade them from giving evidence or tamper with the evidence.        
	The accused cannot change their addresses without informing the CBI and have to surrender their passports if they hadnt done so already. The bench also asked the duo to furnish bonds of Rs 100,000 each and two sureties of the same amount.        
	The brothers, however, are free to move Calcutta High Court for temporary relaxation of the curbs on their movement.        
	Ashok Todi, whose daughter Priyanka had married Rizwanur against her familys wishes, had surrendered in a Calcutta court on December 1. Pradip Todi had surrendered on December 8.        
	The trial court denied them bail and remanded them in judicial custody. The high court upheld the verdict, following which the accused moved appeals in the apex court.        
	Opposing the plea, CBI counsel Amarendra Sharan said: The Todis have shown brazen disregard for all laws.... They are powerful, influential people who may influence witnesses.... There are reasons why the high court did not grant them bail.        
	The accused, he added, had used muscle and money power and even taken the help of Calcutta police to separate Rizwanur from Priyanka. Had it not been for the Todis, Rizwanur would not have committed suicide, the lawyer stated.        
	The bench rejected the submission, saying: The trial has been stayed. What is the purpose of keeping the duo in custody?        
	On the Todis intimidating witnesses, the bench observed: You (CBI) are a powerful prosecuting agency... protect your witnesses.... The moment you feel they (the accused) are interfering with the prosecution, move the court and get their bail cancelled.

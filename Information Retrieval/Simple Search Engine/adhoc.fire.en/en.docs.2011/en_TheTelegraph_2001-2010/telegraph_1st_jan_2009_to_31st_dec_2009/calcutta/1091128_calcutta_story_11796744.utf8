          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta High Court on Friday directed the petroleum ministry to clarify within 14 days why it had banned the use of bio-diesel as vehicular fuel.         
	A bench of acting Chief Justice B. Bhattacharya and Justice K.K. Prasad passed the order after hearing a plea by green activist Subhash Dutta.         
	Dutta said bio-diesel would help control pollution from auto-emission. He told the court that the Centre had earlier encouraged the production of bio-diesel but when a large number of people started manufacturing bio-diesel, the ministry banned its use.         
	He said the Union government had also lifted excise duty and minimised import duty on bio-diesel.         
	State advocate-general Balai Ray said: The state had started using the fuel on an experimental basis. But after the ministrys order, the experiment was stopped.        
	The matter will come up for hearing after five weeks.

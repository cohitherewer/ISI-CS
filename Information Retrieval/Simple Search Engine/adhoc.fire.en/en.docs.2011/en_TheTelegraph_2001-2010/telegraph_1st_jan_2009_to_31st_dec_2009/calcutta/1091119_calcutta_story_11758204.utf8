          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Haj pilgrims who were denied Saudi visas will be flown to Mecca on November 21, state Haj committee chief Syed Mohammed Masih said on Wednesday.        
	The 155 pilgrims, who have been put up in Haj House on Dilkhusha Street, were denied visas because they either did not have passports or got their passports late.        
	Weve arranged their visas and other travel papers, said Syed Mohammed Masih.        
	Earlier, pilgrims who did not have a passport could visit Saudi Arabia with a permit issued by the Haj committee. But from this year, all pilgrims are required to apply for a visa. Several pilgrims were not aware of the change in rules. We will review the situation on November 21, Masih said.

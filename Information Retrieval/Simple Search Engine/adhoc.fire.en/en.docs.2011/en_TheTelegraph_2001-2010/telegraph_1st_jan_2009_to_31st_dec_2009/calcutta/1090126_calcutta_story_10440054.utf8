	McDonalds Indias plans to re-open its Park Street outlet has run into a civic hurdle after the delay in procuring the fire clearance.        
	The eatery, which was to re-open on Saturday, will have to wait at least till Tuesday for the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) clearance.        
	Police closed down the Park Street McDonalds after the fire. For re-opening the outlet, the company will have to approach the civic licence department along with clearance from the police and the fire services. Besides, it will have to furnish an undertaking that the outlet is being re-opened. The company has not approached the civic body till date, said the chief manager (licence) of the civic body, Bhaskar Ghosh.         
	A McDonalds official claimed: We have procured all the licences and approvals that are required to open the restaurant.        
	The eatery was shut down after an explosion on the morning of August 12, 2007, that killed a pedestrian. The renovation was completed in the third quarter of 2008. The no-objection from the fire services department came through this month.        
	On Thursday evening, the company announced that the restaurant would be opened on Saturday. On Friday, the shutters of the store were partially opened and the logo was unveiled. The eatery, however, did not open doors on Saturday.        
	We have completed our investigation and have given the eatery a clean chit, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police (detective department).        
	An official in the fire services department said: We have given the required permission. We have not stopped them from opening the restaurant.

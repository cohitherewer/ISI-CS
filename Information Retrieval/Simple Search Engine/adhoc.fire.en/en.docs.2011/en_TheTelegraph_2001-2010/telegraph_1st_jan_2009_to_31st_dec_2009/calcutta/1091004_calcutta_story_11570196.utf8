The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mahfuz Khans puja pandal 
                                                                                                               Mahfuz Khans puja pandal

	Durga Puja is fast turning into a lesson for religious harmony. Its been long since it climbed down from being a puja of the rajas and zamindars when a group of middle-class Bengalis at Guptipara in Hooghly had the temerity to organise the puja of all pujas, the five-day long Durga puja. Today it is celebrated as a grand city event, with many communities participating.         
	Many members of the minority community participate in Puja, not only pandal-hopping or standing in the bhog queue.         
	Mahfuz Khan is in charge of the pandal of Mudiali Club, though he also takes an active part in his para puja on NSC Road. An interior designer, he had been working on the pandal for the last two months, which included the Ramazan fast days. I would take a break for a few hours in the evening and come back to the site to oversee the work, he said.         
	His effort is appreciated by the assistant secretary of Mudiali Club, Shardul Parekh: Mahfuzbhai is one of the pillars of our committee. It is amazing to see to his dedication to his work.        
	Mudiali was deemed a Four Star puja in the CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja 2009.         
	For Khans family, just like any other Bengali family, puja means no cooking at home. We dont cook during the four days of the festival. Our family is always invited to our para puja, where we have our lunch and dinner, he says.         
	I am organising Durga puja for 15 years in Chetla Agrani Club. I think Durga puja is no longer just a religious festival confined to a particular community, says Fihad Hakim of Chetla, president of the puja.         
	This year I selected the theme of under the sea with my other committee members. My wife also takes part actively in the puja, he added.         
	Belonging to an orthodox Muslim family never came in the way of Reyaz Ahmed, a resident of Tollygunge, in celebrating Puja. I dont think there is any conflict in celebrating a festival, said Reyaz. His friend Faroque Iqbal, an employee at a private bank, would love to try out the bhog.         
	Shakil Akhter is attached to Khidderpore Pally Sarodiya Committee for the past seven years. This year we celebrated the 67th year of our puja. In our committee there are other active Muslim members and we celebrate both Id and Durga puja, says Shakil.         
	But Trinamul councillor and MLA Javed Ahmed Khan is more into pandal-hopping. I visit all the pandals in my locality on Ashtami. I take my son along, he says. From my childhood I used to visit puja pandals, he adds.                          TALAT SALAHUDDIN

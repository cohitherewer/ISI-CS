The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Flirt with Akon, dance with Desi girl   Dance to Bolly beat
                                                                                                               Flirt with Akon, dance with Desi girl
  - Bring on the Bollywood beat is the cry from party people sold on standard starry moves          POULOMI BANERJEE                                                  
	The year-end parties in town proved once again that even if Calcuttas swing set likes to flirt with Rihanna or Akon for a track or two, this desi heart belongs to Desi girl.        
	Calcutta sings along with rock classics, but when it comes to dancing the night away, Bollywood beats beat the best of them. Across city clubs on Christmas Eve and New Years Eve, organisers put together a mixed sound. The crowd may have enjoyed listening to English acts, but it was only when DJs brought on their brand of Hindi music that the dance floor came alive.        
	I am enjoying the music, said Dimpy Magon at Saturday Club on Christmas Eve as DJ Vicky took over the console post-midnight with Bolly chartbusters. The mood at the club was the same a week later when Dhwani diverged from its Bolly repertoire to Rivers of Babylon. An audible sigh went up and the band switched straight back to Bolly.        
	The younger set likes international tracks, but those above 30 prefer to dance to Bollywood. When playing for the masses, Bollywood is definitely the better option. It peps everyone up, said DJ Vicky, who manned the console at the BTP bash in Swabhumi on December 31.         
	So all popular DJs serve mainly Bolly music, peppered with some international tracks. In a set, I play six-seven Bolly numbers and keep one or two hip-hop for variety. People relate to Bollywood, said DJ Ravi.        
	The time and occasion play an important role. On Saturdays, we get a commercial crowd. The peak hour is 11.30pm to 2am, when we play mostly Bollywood. House and hip-hop is for a niche group, said DJ Kunal of Venom.        
	Blame it on the comfort quotient or doing what comes naturally. People find it easier to dance to something they can sing along to. And for the masses, thats Bollywood, explained Ravi. Since they are always on television, we already know what steps to do to a Bollywood number. For international tracks, one has to come up with original moves. Its difficult to innovate on the floor, added a guest at CC amp;FCs year-end bash.                                
	Bands have learnt to live with the Bolly beat. Many like listening to live bands, but those who dance prefer DJs with their band of Hindi film songs. Its easier for people to dance to that same, continuing, monotonous tempo. That head-banging kind of music is preferred on the dance floor and everyone jives to it like a herd of sheep, said Nondon Bagchi of Hip Pocket.        
	More exposure to international tracks may, in time, tilt the scale more favourably for English tracks. The responsibility lies with the DJ to push international tracks. That way guests in the city will also feel more comfortable on the dance floor, felt DJ Vishal of Tantra.        
	That may be then, but for now, when its the time to disco, you just have to bring on Bollywood.

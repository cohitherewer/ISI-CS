                      Artistic skill and aesthetic sensibility                    One of the pioneers of the 20th century modern art movement in India, Somnath Hore is renowned not only as an artist but also as a political activist, who, over the years, has boldly used his talents as a graphic artist and sculptor to express his personal angst against a socio-political system which breeds acts of violence. It was the cataclysmic decade of the 1940s, especially the Bengal Famine of 1943, which shaped and moulded his consciousness as an artist. Translating his response to human tragedy by using his artistic skills, Hore has often expressed concern for mans inhumanity against man and the blatant violation of human values whether it is casteism, communalism, the frightful fallout of nuclear blasts or societys inability to preserve human dignity. His sensibility towards and deep empathy with victims of social, racial or political abuse have always found poignant expression in his works. Somnath Hore: Bronzes, Drawings, Watercolours, the ongoing show of his works, puts into perspective the magnificent creativity and versatility of this celebrated master. Hosted by The Seagull Foundation for the Arts.                    Event: An exhibition of the works of Somnath Hore When: Till May 20; 2 pm - 8 pm Where: Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre, 36C, S.P. Mukherjee Road

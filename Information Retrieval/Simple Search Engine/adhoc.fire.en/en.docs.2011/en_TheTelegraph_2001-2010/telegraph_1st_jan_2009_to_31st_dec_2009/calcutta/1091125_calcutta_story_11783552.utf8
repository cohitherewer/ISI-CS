                      Communicating with colours                    Pulsating with vibrant energy, the ongoing group show, Color Immersion, focuses on the central role played by an artists palette in the creation of any work of art. It features a group of painters who have crafted their individual inspirations in a variety of styles, and who are united in their understanding of the intimate relationship between colour and emotion. The artists display remarkable skill, imagination and ingenuity in their use of colour, bearing testimony to their natural flair and perceptive artistry. Playful, humorous, saturated with colour and presented in a unique fashion, this is an exhibition to delight the senses. Each painter, in varying degrees of realism, can be observed to be striking out on his own path, taking delight in the rhythms and energies of creation itself. Participating artists include Atin Basak, Ramananda Bandopadhyay, Subrata Saha, Aditya Basak, Subrata Gangopadhyay, Subrata Pal, Suhas Roy, Bratin Khan (a painting by him appears here), Gourango Beshai and Sibsaday Chaudhuri.

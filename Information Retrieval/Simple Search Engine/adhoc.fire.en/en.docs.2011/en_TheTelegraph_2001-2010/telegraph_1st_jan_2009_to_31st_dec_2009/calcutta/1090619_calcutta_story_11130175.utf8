                                                                                                               Balcony collapse kills one
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The broken balcony on Bondel Road and the damaged roof of the caretakers room. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                  
	A second-floor balcony of a Bondel Road house collapsed on its caretakers asbestos-roofed room on Thursday morning, killing him and seriously injuring three of his family members.        
	The rubble from the balcony bore through the asbestos, inflicting wounds on the heads and legs of Debraj Bose, 60, his wife Sikha, 55, their daughter Arpita, 16, and grandson Rupam, 7.        
	The four were rushed to Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratisthan. Debraj, whose head was smashed, was shifted to SSKM hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries, said an officer of Karaya police station.         
	Rupam and Arpita were in a critical condition. Their legs were fractured and they sustained severe head injuries. They have to be operated on, added the officer.         
	A preliminary investigation revealed lack of maintenance to be the cause of the balcony collapse. The three-storeyed building was constructed around 50 years ago.        
	The landlord stays on the top floor while there are offices on the other two floors. The landlord will be charged with negligence, said an officer of Karaya police station.        
	Civic officials visited the spot and workers demolished portions of the building.         
	The incident took place around 9.30am when the four were sitting in the 10ftx10ft room on the premises of 7B Bondel Road.         
	I was walking down the lane when I heard a loud sound and found the second-floor balcony had crashed down on the caretakers room, said Anil Kumar, a resident of the area.        
	Local youths and traders rushed to the spot and extricated the family. All four were bleeding profusely.         
	Debraj had been working as caretaker of the building for the past 15 years, said Gaur Shankar Gayen, a relative of the family who works as a caretaker in a neighbourhood building.

          A STAFF REPORTER                          The recovered tridents. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                  
	A councillor on a morning walk stumbled upon two decorative brass tridents stolen three weeks ago from Swami Vivekanandas ancestral home, barely 24 hours after a third one went missing from the heritage address.        
	Pranati Bhattacharya, the councillor of Calcutta Municipal Corporations ward No. 12, was walking past a garbage vat near Deshbandhu Park around 7.30am on Monday when something wrapped in a white rag caught her eye.              
	I immediately called some workers of the local conservancy wing to check what it was. To our surprise, we found two tridents that turned out to be the ones stolen from Swami Vivekanandas home on Gour Mohan Mukherjee Street on October 23, said Bhattacharya.        
	The councillor handed over the tridents, each weighing around 5kg, to a team from Girish Park police station and the anti-burglary department. They will be returned to the Ramakrishna Mission authorities, who maintain the home, after being presented in court.        
	The two brass tridents  and the one that was found missing on Sunday  were screwed onto wooden posts in a railing on the first-floor verandah of Ramakrishna Mission Swami Vivekanandas Ancestral House and Cultural Centre. The railing had 15 tridents before the two incidents of theft three weeks apart.        
	We suspect the tridents were dumped in a public place so that someone would find it. It could be that those responsible for the robbery became wary of getting caught after failing to sell or smuggle those out of the city, said an officer of the anti-burglary department.        
	Two burglars arrested in the wake of the October 23 theft had told interrogators that one among them had seen the stolen tridents in the possession of a gang of thieves.        
	We need to interrogate them again to find out whether the same gang was responsible for Sundays thef, said Damayanti Sen, the deputy commissioner of the detective department.

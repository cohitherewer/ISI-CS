          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Three employees of a homoeopathy clinic-cum-shop in Bhowanipore were arrested on Sunday for cheating two customers by selling fake medicines.         
	Two young men from Midnapore and Shantipur, Nadia, lodged complaints with police stating that they had spent more than Rs 30,000 each in the past six months on medicines provided at the clinic for erectile dysfunction but had not benefited.         
	The complainants produced prescriptions and cash receipts. We raided the shop and arrested Biman Hajra, Kabirujjaman and Debabrata Dey, said Rajesh Subarno, the deputy commissioner of police (south).         
	According to the police, the Midnapore resident turned up at the Bhowanipore store on Sunday evening and demanded his money back.        
	He was supported by the Shantipur resident, who was present in the shop at the time.         
	The arrested trio will be produced in court tomorrow.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rainy weekend ahead 
                                                                                                               Rainy weekend ahead 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The monsoon rain over the past two days will continue on Saturday as well, but with lower intensity. Normal monsoon conditions and a low-pressure area over Orissa had brought the rainfall to Gangetic Bengal, said an official of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore. The low-pressure belt has since shifted to Madhya Pradesh.        
	The city and its surrounding areas will receive seasonal rain in the next 24 hours but the intensity will be lower because of the westward shift of the low-pressure belt, the official added.        
	Satellite images at 8.30am on Friday showed convective clouds over most parts of Bay of Bengal and coastal Bengal.        
	The city during the day received 10mm of rain while the temperature varied between 28.3 and 26.3 degrees Celsius.         
	Uttam Kumar stamp: The department of posts will release a commemorative postage stamp on Uttam Kumars 84th birth anniversary on September 3. The stamp, valued at Rs 5, will be released by governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi at Uttam Mancha.         
	Body in pond: The body of a 75-year-old woman was found in a pond in Howrah on Friday morning. Nehabala Pradhan, a resident of Garh Mirjapur in Howrah, had been missing since Thursday afternoon.

	Shaw Public School held its first annual sports at the Oxford Mission School grounds in Behala on February 6 . The chief guest of the event was Barry OBrien. Also present were former footballer Aloke Mukherjee and cricketer Ashok Dinda, a member of Kolkata Knight Riders.         
	The day kicked off with a march past by the houses Emerald (green), Ruby (red), Sapphire (blue) and Topaz (gold).         
	What made the event different was the felicitation of four physically challenged persons by the Behala school.         
	Manoj Ghosh, the former headmaster of Chandanpur Prathamik Vidyalaya, in North 24-Parganas, and a recipient of The Telegraph Education Foundation Lifetime Achievement Award, Nirmal Ghosh, a visually challenged doctor, a mountaineering enthusiast and also honoured by The Telegraph Education Foundation, Lopamudra Sarkar, suffering from cerebral palsy and a recipient of The Telegraph Foundation Surendra Paul Memorial Award for Courage, and Chinmoy Mondal, a visually challenged national-level chess player and a The Telegraph Education Foundation scholarship holder, became the role models for the four houses.        
	Besides conventional races, there were non-competitive ones, too, like the Topor Race and Kolkata  Made for Each Other. Theme races like Bazaar Kolkata (where kindergarten kids had to buy paper cut-outs of fish from four vendors  and Mishti Mukh (collecting sweets) were a huge hit.         
	The school had also invited four rickshaw van-pullers to the event. Thanks to them, our children are never late for school.We made them participate in a race. This was our way of thanking them, said Anjana Saha, the principal of the school.         
	I have been to many sports events. But this was pleasantly different, said OBrien.        
	Dinda, too, was all praises for the event. Not everyone can become a successful sportsperson but sport must be encouraged as it helps in the overall development of character, he added.         
	Topaz House emerged the overall winner.                           SUBHOJOY ROY

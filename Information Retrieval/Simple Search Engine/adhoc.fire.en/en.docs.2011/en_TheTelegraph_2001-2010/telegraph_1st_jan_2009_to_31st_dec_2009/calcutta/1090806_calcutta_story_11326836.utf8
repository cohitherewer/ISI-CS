	The more we know, the more we grow. In an age when education is the last thing one associates with the idiot box, kids channel Pogo has launched a show based on this premise.         
	Announcing the launch of F.A.Q. (Frequently Asked Questions) in Calcutta on July 24 at The Park, Krishna Desai, the director of programming, South Asia, Turner International India, promised to reintroduce science as an engaging, exciting subject. F.A.Q. will do to science what our other immensely popular show M.A.D., or Music Art Dance, has done to the arts, he said. The show has begun airing from July 19.        
	In each thematic episode, F.A.Q. will demystify the principles of air, water, gas and heat. Why is the sky blue? Does potato emit electricity? Kids constantly ask such questions. We set up experiments on the sets to illustrate the answer in a fun fashion, said the shows young anchor Prateek Sethi, who conducts the experiments with the help of a robot called Crash.         
	Several such experiments were carried out at the launch. Paper cups were arranged on top of one another for the first. Crash walked in, carrying a drum with a hole at one end. With the hole facing the pyramid of paper cups, he banged the stick on the other end of the drum, and the arrangement came crashing down. In another, soft drink cans left tilted on the edge stayed that way without support.         
	What raised most eyebrows was an experiment with a bowl of cornflower. When one dipped a finger into the cornflower, it went in without resistance. But when the cornflower was punched, the fist crashed against a solid surface.         
	Cornflower is a non-Newtonian fluid. When force is applied to it, the molecules interlock and form a mesh. Otherwise, it behaves like a liquid, said Prateek, recalling that at the shooting, the kids had danced on a giant cornflower tub.         
	The channel is not confining the fun-learn process to the telly. We are going to 900 schools, both English and vernacular-medium, in 19 cities. Of these, 60 will be in Calcutta, Desai said.         
	Viewers are also being encouraged to ask questions on an interactive website on www.pogo.tv, where kids can look up do-it-yourself experiments, games, videos and a trivia section. The child sending the best question will get to ask it in person on the show.

	Big, bad wolf sings in Mandarin                  Students perform Little Red Riding Hood in Chinese at the anniversary celebrations of The School of Chinese Language in Sunny Park last month. Picture by Anindya Shankar Ray      
	Does the name Xia Hong Mao remind you of a popular fairy tale? Perhaps not. Unless you knew that it was Mandarin for Little Red Riding Hood. The story of the little girl lured by the big bad wolf on her way to her grandmothers was turned into a play by the Mandarin language students of The School of Chinese Language on the eve of their first anniversary celebration in July.         
	The play, interspersed with Chinese folk songs, was enacted entirely in Mandarin by the students. Ive been learning the language for a year, but it was still difficult to memorise all the lines and deliver them without being prompted, said Shilpa Baheti, who played Little Red Riding Hood.         
	Though it is not a Chinese story, we chose it because it is known to most people here and therefore, accessible, explained Sayanti Sengupta, who played Red Riding Hoods mother. Sengupta, an IT professional with Wipro, has received job offers in China. A lot of Indo-Chinese collaborations are happening today. I want to tap into the job opportunities opening up for people who know Chinese, English as well as Indian languages, she added.        
	The school, in Sunny Park, Ballygunge, offers courses in spoken language, business Mandarin and a three-semester intensive course.         
	Attended by the consul-general of China in Calcutta, Mao Siwei, the evening also saw prizes being given away to meritorious students. When you travel to a foreign country, knowing a persons native language makes it easier to touch peoples hearts, said Siwei, speaking of learning Mandarin.

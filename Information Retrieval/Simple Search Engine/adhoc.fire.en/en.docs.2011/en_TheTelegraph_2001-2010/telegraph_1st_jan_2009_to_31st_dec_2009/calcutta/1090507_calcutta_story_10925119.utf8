	Two persons were injured in a clashes between supporters of the CPM and the Trinamul Congress at Ahiripukur in Karaya on Tuesday night.        
	According to police, trouble broke out around 9.30pm when local goon Mohammed Shakil, along with three associates, surfaced in the area after two years.        
	Some CPM supporters asked Shakil, a Trinamul supporter, to leave the area immediately, which led to fisticuffs. The groups hurled stones and then bombs at each other, said an officer. After half an hour, the CPM supporters overpowered Shakil and his associates and beat them up. Two were injured.        
	Shakil, who owns a flat in the locality, was arrested in 2007 in connection with an abduction and released on bail. He fled and started a business near the port, said the police.        
	Five detained: Five youths were detained on Wednesday morning after they prevented officials of the South 24-Parganas administration from removing illegal hoardings from the Lake Town swimming pool area. The five were released after the hoardings were removed.

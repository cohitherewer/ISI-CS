                      Gems of Hindi film music                    Films Division, Government of India and Nandan, West Bengal Film Centre jointly present Film Memoirs: Singers on Celluloid, featuring documentaries on two great playback singers of the Hindi film industry. Mubarak Begum (dir: Bipin Choubal; at 6 pm) is a biographical documentary on the famous ghazal singer who also cut some unforgettable numbers for Hindi films. Beginning her career with light music recitals for All India Radio, she got her first break as a playback singer in the movie, Aaiye, with the song Mohe aane lagi aangrayi. Her biggest success came with the song, Haal-e-dil sunayenge, in Bimal Roys Madhumati. However, though blessed with a soulful, melodious voice which had a haunting effect on her listeners, she could not reach the heights that she ought to have. Mohd. Rafi (dir: Kuldeep Sinha; at 6.20 pm) offers a fascinating study of the life of the legendary singer who will always be remembered for his magical voice and evergreen songs. Having learnt Hindustani classical music from masters Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan and Ustad Abdul Abdul Wahid Khan, among others, he enriched Indian film music with a staggering 26,000 melodious songs, which he sang in many regional languages, besides Hindi.

                                                                                                               Cops wear pollution mask 
  Autos throw caution to wind

	As Sadhan Maiti drove his 16-year-old auto past a police van on Sunday, the two-stroke sham behind the ban smokescreen was out in the open.         
	Maiti, one of the 70,000-odd auto drivers benched by the high court-imposed ban on polluting vehicles, did not take out his rickety three-wheeler from August 1 till 4. On August 5, he ferried passengers on the Garia-Prince Anwar Shah Road route but did not park the vehicle at the stand lest it caught the polices eye. On Sunday, the last vestige of hesitation was gone.         
	I had feared a sustained crackdown from August 1. But as the days went by, I realised that the cops werent really keen to crack the whip, said Maiti, speeding past a police van stationed outside MR Bangur Hospital.         
	None of the cops in the van so much as cast a glance at the auto.         
	Around 200 of the 400-odd autos on the Tollygunge-Garia route were on the road on Sunday. Drivers said only 35-40 autos in that fleet had switched to LPG.         
	There are fewer cops on the road on Sundays. In any case, the police have not been targeting autos since the first couple of days after the ban took effect. We are making the best of this opportunity, said Sheikh Nizamuddin, another driver out on the streets with a banned auto.         
	Barely 600 autos had plied on the first two days of the month. The number gradually increased to around 4,000, including 2,200 LPG-powered autos, by Saturday.         
	Sources in the auto unions said at least 8,000 autos, both legal and banned, plied on Sunday.         
	The presence of two-stroke autos seemed to be higher in south Calcutta, mainly near the two stands off the Tollygunge tram depot, those at Kudghat and the one at Garia.                   The wooden frame of a banned bus bursts at   its seams       
	Buses and taxis older than 15 years were also more visible than in the past week.         
	The police seized only two autos on Sunday, raising the total to a mere 22 vehicles in nine days. A senior officer in Lalbazar claimed that the number of seized vehicles was small because most owners of banned two-wheelers, buses and taxis had gone out of business.         
	The vehicles that you are seeing on the road are out of the ban boundary, the officer said.         
	A contingent of 350 police personnel was out on the streets to seize banned vehicles, though where they were looking is anybodys guess.         
	Our teams have been tracking the auto stands. The two autos seized on Sunday were ferrying passengers in Taratala and Alipore, the officer said.         
	Sovan Deb Chattopadhyay, the leader of the Trinamul-backed Auto Bachao Committee, said his organisation had advised drivers of banned vehicles not to ply but couldnt force its decision on them. They (the auto drivers) are poor people. We cant snatch their livelihood, can we? he asked.         
	Green activist Subhash Dutta threw his hands up in despair.         
	The administration is not at all serious in imposing the ban. Auto drivers who had feared that the crackdown would continue are now crowding the streets. The fleet will soon be out in full force.

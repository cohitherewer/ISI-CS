          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Legal activist Deepak Pralhadka was arrested on Friday for allegedly confining an 18-year-old girl in a red-light area and forcing her into prostitution. The girls aunt, Shimla Singh, who allegedly runs a brothel in Burtola, was also arrested.        
	The girl was rescued five years ago from the same area and sent to a home. In October 2008, her aunt brought her back promising to bring her up well. Pralhadka, too, had pledged to help Shimla bring up the girl. But after leaving the shelter, the girl started sending text messages to its employees that she had been confined in a room, said an officer.

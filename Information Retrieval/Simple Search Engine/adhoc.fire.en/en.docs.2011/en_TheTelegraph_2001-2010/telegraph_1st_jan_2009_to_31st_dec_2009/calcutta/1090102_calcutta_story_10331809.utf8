                                                                                                               482 feel police party punch
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Around 1,000 revellers were caught on the wrong side of the law on New Years Eve.         
	Four-hundred-and-eighty-two people were arrested for disorderly conduct and 481 motorists were charged with drink driving and violation of traffic rules.        
	Eight police teams were deployed on a 1-km stretch on Park Street, from the JL Nehru Road intersection to the Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road crossing, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police, detective department.        
	In the Park Street and Shakespeare Sarani police station areas  hot spots on New Years Eve  232 revellers were arrested.        
	Two watch towers were set up to ensure a peaceful festive night. We also deployed officers on rooftops of tall buildings to keep an eye on the revellers. They scanned the crowd using binoculars and informed the policemen on the road through man-pack sets, said an officer.        
	No one was, however, arrested for molestation or eve-teasing. There were some verbal complaints, but no one lodged an FIR, said an officer.        
	Pradip Chatterjee, the joint commissioner of police (administration), said a large number of policewomen was deployed. They patrolled in plainclothes and nabbed a number of youths who were creating trouble.        
	Thirty youths were arrested from the port area and 31 revellers from the eastern part of the city.        
	Traffic cops said motorists, especially those on two-wheelers, were found driving dangerously once they crossed the Park Street-Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road crossing.        
	A large number of revellers headed for the Bypass for a late night joyride. We stopped motorcyclists who were driving dangerously and checked them manually and with breathalysers to ascertain whether they had consumed more than the permissible amount of alcohol, said an officer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Empty Eden and heavy hearts 
                                                                                                               Empty Eden and heavy hearts 
          SAIONEE CHAKRABORTY      
	They were part of the Eden Gardens crowd last year, rooting for Dadas boys in black and gold, cheering every run scored and every wicket scalped, singing along to the tune of the Knight Riders anthem Korbo lorbo jeetbo re.         
	Season 2 of the Indian Premier League (IPL) would have been no different had security issues not played spoilsport.        
	Two die-hard fans of the Knight Riders (and Shah Rukh Khan and Sourav Ganguly) spoke to Metro on Sunday about their disappointment at IPL moving out of town, even if only for this year.        
	Ananya Basu, 21, a student of graphic design         
	I remember sitting in the upper tier of the clubhouse with thakuma (grandmother) for company during a KKR match against the Bangalore Royal Challengers. It was such fun!         
	Seeing Sourav (Ganguly) and SRK in the flesh was a dream come true. I was clicking pictures all the time  of the match, the players and the crowd. I managed to click Shah Rukhs picture, too, but from far. Me and some friends had planned to buy lower-tier tickets this time so that we could get a better view of SRK and his Bollywood entourage.         
	I am very disappointed at the tournament being moved out of India. Frankly, I dont understand the logic behind it. If it is the Indian Premier League, it should be held in the country. I think the enthusiasm among fans will fizzle out now.        
	Debayan Ghosh, 12, a student of St James School        
	I was at the Eden Gardens for two of the IPL matches last year. I remember dancing to Korbo lorbo jeetbo re whenever KKR did well. We would even have mini celebrations at home. I also thought that the KKR cheerleaders were the best among the lot.        
	I will really miss going to the ground this season. I think this was the last opportunity to watch Sourav hit those towering sixes in his home ground.        
	I would have tried to get close to Shah Rukh Khan, one of my favourite actors, this year. My parents had promised to buy me a pair of KKR shoes to wear to the ground. All my plans have been dashed with the tournament being shifted abroad for reasons that dont make sense to me.

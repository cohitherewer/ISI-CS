The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Parents face testing times
                                                                                                               Parents face testing times

	Minister Kapil Sibal may be trying to banish exams from the lives of schoolchildren but a city institution has just brought exams back into their parents lives.        
	St Augustines Day School has decided to award up to 25 per cent marks in terminal and annual examinations on the basis of how parents have groomed their wards physically, mentally and academically. The idea is to make parents more accountable for how their children are doing in school.        
	A students marksheet will now have two sections, one reflecting his/her academic performance and the other indicating how the childs parents have fared.        
	Parents will lose marks if their children come to school in dirty uniform. They will also be assessed in terms of their wards attendance and their own presence at parent-teacher meetings. Homework will be a factor, too, said education officer Richard Gasper.         
	The school has three campuses, one on Ripon Street in north Calcutta and the other two in Barrackpore and Shyamnagar.        
	The management intends switching to the new system of evaluation on the Barrackpore campus within three months.         
	This concept is hugely popular abroad and we have engaged an expert from the UK to help us implement it, an official said.        
	The school recently made it compulsory for either the mother or father of a student to converse with the child in English even at home, though it isnt known whether British advice had anything to do with the diktat.         
	Opinion may be divided on where the schools responsibility ends and the parents begins under the new assessment system, but the authorities are convinced that it is the only way to increase accountability.        
	There is a growing tendency among busy parents to ignore the day-to-day progress of their wards, which includes academic performance and personality development. The St Augustines group of schools has decided to assess parents to bring about a balance between what is taught and imbibed in the class and at home, the official said.        
	A central government notification prevents schools from detaining children in any class at the primary level on the basis of performance in annual examinations. Teachers say this has made a section of parents casual about their childrens primary education.         
	There is another group of parents who are only concerned about academic development. They do not pay attention to a childs appearance and personality, Gasper said.

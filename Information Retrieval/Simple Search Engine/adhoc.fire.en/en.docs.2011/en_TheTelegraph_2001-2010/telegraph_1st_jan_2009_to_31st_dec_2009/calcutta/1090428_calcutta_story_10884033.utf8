The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Six suspended at film school
                                                                                                               Six suspended at film school
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Six students of the Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute (SRFTI) were suspended and asked to leave their hostel by 5pm on Monday. Two of the six are in the city. They did not move out of the hostel till late on Monday.        
	The suspension orders  for engaging in activities prejudicial to the interests of the institute  were put up on the film schools notice boards and outside the students hostel rooms and mailed to their homes on Saturday, following a meeting of the general council in Mumbai the day before.        
	Most students were not on the campus when the notices were put up. We saw the notices late on Sunday. We are seeking legal help to stall the suspension, said one of the six.        
	A legal notice countering the charges should reach the administration by tomorrow, added the student.        
	According to him, some of the other suspended students had gone to Mumbai for the meeting and have not returned yet.        
	The institute, closed since April 2, will not open till all six leave the campus, stressed the authorities.        
	The governing council heard the representatives of the students as well as the staff welfare association. It took a grim view of the vandalism on campus and the illegal confinement of senior officials and decided to suspend six students, said Swapan Mullick, the director of the institute and the member-secretary of the governing council.         
	He will issue individual chargesheets against the six. We were compelled to take the step. If the students admit the charges, the authorities will decide on their punishment. If they deny the charges, an independent inquiry officer, who is not associated with the institute, will probe the matter and submit a report to the chairman within 30 days, added Mullick.        
	The chairman will then place the report before the governing council, which will pass the final order.         
	Students had detained the dean, director, administrative officer and the purchase officer for over 24 hours from March 31 afternoon and demanded their resignation, holding them responsible for inadequate infrastructure on campus.

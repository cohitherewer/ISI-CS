The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mahi ramps up fashion week
                                                                                                               Mahi ramps up fashion week
  - Brand ambassador to miss city event for Lanka tri-series          OUR BUREAU                          Mahendra Singh Dhoni strikes a pose at the event where the new logo of Kolkata Fashion Week was unveiled. (Pabitra Das)                                        
	Come September, Kolkata Fashion Weeks brand ambassador Mahendra Singh Dhoni will be sharing the ramp with Yuvraj (Singh). Not in the city, though.         
	 I will be in Sri Lanka (for the tri-series) when KFW is on (from September 9 to 13). I am happy playing cricket, and it is easy for me. I am leaving modelling to the professionals, the Team India skipper said on Thursday, shortly after landing in the city for a day to announce Season II of KFW.        
	Dhoni, looking every bit the fashion icon in rust tees, faded denims, broad belt, chunky watch and gelled hair, said he was in the thick of things in terms of organising the event despite being busy the past week ramping up his cricket fitness to coach Gary Kirstens choreography.        
	KFW is the first event of its kind in eastern India and it gives me immense pleasure to be associated with it. Last time it was rated as one of the best fashion weeks in India with a great line-up of designers, models and showstoppers. This time the number of designers have doubled from 20 to 40, and we have got big names like Ritu Kumar, Manish Malhotra, Rocky S and my favourite designer Nari (Narendra Kumar), he said.         
	Ranchis most famous resident also promised to solve the issues that had cropped up during the KFW debut in April, when cricket had kept him away from the event.        
	Mahi took a break from the pre-season conditioning camp in Delhi this time around to unveil the new KFW logo and announce the designer and sponsor line-up at The Park. He confessed to not knowing many designers from Calcutta but hoped he would by the time the next edition was held.        
	This time we have a lot more Calcutta designers participating in KFW (than in the first edition); so by next time I will have a clear idea about their work.         
	But while Dhonis fashion connection with Calcutta is new, his association with the city began several years ago.         
	I have played under-13, under-16 and under-19 cricket here. I have played for Bihar and Jharkhand, and for a lot of trophies like the P. Sen Trophy. I also held a job at the Kharagpur (railway) station. I can understand Bengali and speak a little bit of it. So I am quite associated with the city, he said.        
	The skippers favourite designer is, however, from Mumbai. He remains a big fan of Narendra Kumar and loves wearing Rocky S sometimes.         
	 I am a casual guy and love my jeans and T-shirts. Designers come into play only when I have to dress for special occasions. Fashion for me is being comfortable in what I am wearing, he said, the trademark broad smile in place.         
	So what could be the next (hair)style surprise from the skipper? Going bald maybe, he grinned.

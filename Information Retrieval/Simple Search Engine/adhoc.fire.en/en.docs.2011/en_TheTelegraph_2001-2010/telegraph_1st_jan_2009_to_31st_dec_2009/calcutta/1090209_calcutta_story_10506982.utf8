                      Images of the soul                    Trained in the Western style of painting, Kanchanmala Ghosh initially painted vibrant floral compositions. Deciding to breakout of her own mould, she now experiments with sensitive portraits in charcoals. Having developed, refined and simplified her works over the years, the beauty of her latest creations is enhanced by the fact that they are in monochrome. Monochrome, the ongoing solo show of her recent paintings, finds the artist delving into the subconscious mind, in an attempt to look for and reveal hidden depths of human character. Capturing light and using it to her advantage, she allows viewers to gaze into the soul of her protagonists. Like a clairvoyant, she lays bare their innermost sentiments and emotions, that may sometimes be sombre, with a tinge of melancholy, while at others, infused with mischief or the suggestion of a smile. Her works on nature are vignettes that manifest a photographers passion and imagination. Contemporary in design, yet deeply spiritual in intent, Ghoshs works radiate meaning and substance bordering on the sublime. Hosted by Verandah Art Gallery.

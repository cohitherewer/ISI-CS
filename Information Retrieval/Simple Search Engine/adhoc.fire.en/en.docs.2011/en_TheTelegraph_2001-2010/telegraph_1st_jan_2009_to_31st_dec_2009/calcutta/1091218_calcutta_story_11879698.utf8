          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The death of a 27-year-old homemaker in Behala has triggered charges of dowry torture leading to the arrest of the in-laws.        
	Samhita Ghosh was found dead in her in-laws house in Panchanantala late on Wednesday. Police said they had spotted ligature marks on her neck and injury marks on other parts of her body.        
	Following a complaint from Samhitas father Prasanta Das, a team from Thakurpukur police station arrested her in-laws Shanticharan and Mala Ghosh. Husband Sanjay, the manager of a guest house, was absconding.        
	The Ghosh duo have been remanded in judicial custody for 14 days, said S.K. Chowdhry, the additional superintendent of South 24-Parganas police.        
	Samhita got married to Sanjay, whom she knew since her childhood, in June 2006. My father had given them lot of furniture and also opened a fixed deposit account of Rs 50,000 in their names. But they still tortured my sister for dowry, said Samhitas sister Sanjukta.        
	Sanjay called me on Tuesday evening, asking me to bring my daughter home as his mother was torturing her, said Samhitas mother Namita.

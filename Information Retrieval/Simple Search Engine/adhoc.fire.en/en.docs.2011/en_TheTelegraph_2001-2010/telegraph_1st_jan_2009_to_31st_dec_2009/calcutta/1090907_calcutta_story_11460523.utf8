The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Ravaged roads Part I
                                                                                                               Ravaged roads Part I
                            
	A rare long spell of rain at the end of a light monsoon has dotted the city roads with craters. Those responsible for maintaining the thoroughfares are content to pass the buck and make promises. Not all the damaged roads are under the civic body. It also remains to be seen whether the roads were damaged in the rain. Within September 18, all damaged roads will be touched up so that commuters do not face problems during Puja, says mayoral council member (roads and engineering) Tuhin Bera. Commuters, however, blame their troubles on the road on shoddy construction, random repairs and callous authorities. Heres the first part of a Metro series on ravaged roads:               
	BEHALA  The stretch of Diamond Harbour Road near Ajanta cinema was re-laid this year. The volume of trucks that use the road and frequent waterlogging are to blame for the condition of the thoroughfare now, say cops and residents  
	ESPLANADE  A portion of the road off KC Das has been blocked for months for work on sewer lines. Hence, thorough repairs have not been undertaken on the free part of this congested stretch despite rainwater washing away the bitumen layer               
	NEW ALIPORE  The portion of Diamond Harbour Road near 
  Taratala flyover provides a glimpse into the terrible condition of roads in New Alipore. The craters slow down traffic on this congested stretch   
	TARATALA  Repairs on the road near Taratala crossing have been undone in only two months. The poor quality of   materials used is one of the factors for the rapid   deterioration of the thoroughfare, say residents

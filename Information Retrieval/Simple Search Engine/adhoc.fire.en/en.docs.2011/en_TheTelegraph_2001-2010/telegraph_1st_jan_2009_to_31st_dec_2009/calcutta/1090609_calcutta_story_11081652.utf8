The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sweat surge in dry monsoon 
                                                                                                               Sweat surge in dry monsoon 
  - Blame on Aila for freak weather					 					      OUR BUREAU       
	An early but weak monsoon has put Calcutta on a sticky wicket.        
	Hot, humid and very uncomfortable  thats the weathermans pitch report for the next 48 to 72 hours as the city stares at cloudy skies without a trace of rain.        
	Mondays maximum temperature was 37.5 degree Celsius, two points above normal. But what left the city drained was the high discomfort index of 66 degree Celsius, 11 points above normal.        
	The trigger for the sweat surge is apparently a freak weather phenomenon. A low-pressure belt that had formed over the northern Bay of Bengal, and was expected to move northward into Bengal and activate the monsoon flow, suddenly took a detour and hit Myanmar.        
	Blame it all on Aila, the cyclone that not only brought monsoon earlier than usual to the east but also drastically altered its pattern.        
	Aila has changed the monsoon flow in these parts this year to the extent that you have clouds but no rain, and there is no respite in sight for at least two-three days. Calcutta and its neighbourhood will continue to have cloudy skies, and the discomfort level will be very high, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the weather section at the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.        
	A senior scientist at the India Meteorological Department in Pune added: The monsoon wind is weaker than normal right now, and we do not expect to see a revival of its activity over the next two or three days.        
	The monsoons gradual movement over India is influenced by the formation of low pressure zones in the northern Bay of Bengal, explained a scientist at the India Meteorological Department in Delhi.        
	In a typical monsoon season, we expect to see three or four such low pressure formations, but we havent had a single once since cyclone Aila, he added.        
	Power cuts in parts of Calcutta compounded the effect of the heat and humidity. As if the weather wasnt torturing us enough, CESC is now subjecting us to power cuts, complained homemaker Rita Chatterjee, a resident of BB Ganguly Street, without power for over two hours.        
	The shortfall in CESC-served areas was around 50MW on Monday evening. The discomfort factor over the last 24 hours has pushed up demand to 1,486MW, which is 70-80MW higher than the average for last week, a power department official said.        
	Some city schools are set to reopen on Tuesday after the summer vacation, but the sultry weather and the grim forecast have made parents wary of sending their children to class. I am in two minds about sending my daughter to school this week and exposing her to the heat and humidity. She has been complaining of fatigue and loss of appetite, said the mother of a Class VI student of La Martiniere School for Girls.        
	Some schools could fall back on the special steps used to combat the heat wave-like conditions in April. If the weather remains what it is we might reduce school hours, said Meena Kak, the principal of Lakshmipath Singhania Academy.        
	Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School is scheduled to reopen on June 15, but it is keeping an eye on the sky. We might extend the vacation. I cant risk students taking ill, said principal Malini Bhagat.

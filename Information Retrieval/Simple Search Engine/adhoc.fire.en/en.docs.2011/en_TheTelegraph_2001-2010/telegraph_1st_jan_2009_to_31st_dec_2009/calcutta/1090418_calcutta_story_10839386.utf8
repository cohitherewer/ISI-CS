The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Twin car-thief gangs busted
                                                                                                               Twin car-thief gangs busted
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	An inter-state gang of car thieves that stole 85 vehicles in three months ran out of gas this week when sleuths of the detective department found seven of them together in a city hotel.        
	Interrogation of the arrested persons led police to the suburbs, where three members of a second gang that operated within the city were caught.        
	We have so far arrested 10 thieves and recovered two vehicles each from the gangs, a police officer said.        
	The inter-state gang comprises youths from Pratapgarh in Uttar Pradesh, Lakhisarai and Jamui in Bihar, Jamtara in Jharkhand, Asansol and Calcutta. Their base was Mumbai but they would often visit Calcutta and stay in hotels. Their only job was to steal cars; local contacts would then take the vehicles elsewhere and sell them, the officer said.        
	Most of the stolen cars were sold in Dimapur town of Nagaland and parts of Jharkhand, where used vehicles are in demand.         
	The arrested youths told the police that they didnt know who they worked for. The gang would assemble and target vehicles in Mumbai or in Calcutta on the basis of inputs from other sources, a source said.         
	The three arrested members of the second gang are Iswar Bahadur Chettri, Vinod Singh and Swami. The trio would often dress up as parking lot attendants at wedding parties, offer to help visitors to park their cars and drive away.         
	On other occasions, they would bribe drivers to part with the keys of their owners cars so that they could make duplicates and steal the vehicles at the first opportunity. Sometimes they used hand drills to break open car locks.        
	They have confessed to stealing at least 12 vehicles since January. The trio mostly targeted cars on the northern and southern fringes of the city. The drivers who helped them make duplicate keys were paid between Rs 3,000 and Rs 5,000, an official said.

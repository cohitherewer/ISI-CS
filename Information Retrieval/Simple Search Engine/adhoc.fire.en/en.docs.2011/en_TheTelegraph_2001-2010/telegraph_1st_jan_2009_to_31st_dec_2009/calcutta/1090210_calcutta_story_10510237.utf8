The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Speeding auto mows down man
                                                                                                               Speeding auto mows down man
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A speeding autorickshaw knocked down and killed a 55-year-old pedestrian on BK Pal Avenue on Monday morning.         
	Nabakrishna Adhikary, a resident of Haradhan Lane in Jorabagan, sustained multiple head injuries when he fell on the road. He was taken to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, where doctors declared him dead.        
	After hitting the man, the rogue driver tried to flee but bystanders and residents chased him and pinned him down. He was arrested and his vehicle was impounded.        
	According to witnesses, the deceased was not at fault as he was walking down the left side of the road. I saw the auto of the BK Pal Avenue-Phoolbagan route trying to overtake other autos, said Prakash Mishra, a local resident. Suddenly the auto veered towards the left and hit the man from behind, he added. Residents hired a taxi and took him to hospital.         
	Adhikary was an employee of a garment shop in Sovabazar and was on his way to work when the accident occurred, police said. The police have filed a case against the auto driver under IPC Section 304A (causing death by negligence).        
	It is a bailable offence, said an officer of the traffic departments fatality wing. We could have booked him for culpable homicide not amounting to murder, which is non-bailable. But the government is still examining whether one accused of rash driving can be booked under this section.

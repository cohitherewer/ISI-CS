The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A year of tall talk, no action
                                                                                                               A year of tall talk, no action
                              A polluting factory                            
	Long meetings, detailed discussions but little action  that sums up climate change action in India, particularly West Bengal, in 2009.        
	Vehicles continued to spew greenhouse gases in the cities while the villages bore the brunt of grossly polluting industries like sponge iron. The buffers to combat the damage  trees and water bodies  were systematically destroyed, mostly by breaking rules in the name of development (read real estate).         
	As IPCC chairman R.K. Pachauri had pointed out to this columnist last year, there has been little informed policy-framing in India.         
	And nature has started its payback. Seasonal schedules of rainfall and temperature are getting skewed, especially in Calcutta. Rainfall has become irregular, causing almost a flood-like situation when it pours, while winter is becoming progressively warmer.         
	On the health front, vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue made a comeback and newer ones like chikungunya and an unknown fever swept the city.         
	The spread of awareness was, however, a key development in 2008. The state set up a high-power committee on climate change chaired by the chief minister, which has approved a detailed vulnerability study for the Sunderbans. The study is slated to be extended to the rest of the state.         
	World Bank has undertaken a detailed study on Calcuttas climate while the UKs Department For International Development is planning to initiate various projects on the city.                    JAYANTA BASU

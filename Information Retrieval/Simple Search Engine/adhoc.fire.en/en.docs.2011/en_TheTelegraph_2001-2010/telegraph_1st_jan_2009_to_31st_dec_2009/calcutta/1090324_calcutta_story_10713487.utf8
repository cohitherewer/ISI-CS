                                                                                                               Modern museum in the making   Raise the creative bar
  - Heavyweights brainstorm the challenges and opportunities of KMOMA          SOMAK GHOSHAL                          Art historian Jean-Francois Chevrier and architect Harry Gugger at Taj Bengal on Monday. Telegraph picture                                        
	A miniature model of the forthcoming Kolkata Museum of Modern Art (KMOMA) was unveiled by Harry Gugger, a partner with the architectural firm Herzog and de Meuron, at the daylong international symposium, Museums of the Future, organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) and KMOMA on Monday.        
	Gugger spoke of the twin challenges in designing a project like KMOMA. First, there has to be a structural balance, in that the entire edifice must convey the sense of spread and compactness at once. Next, the institution must be integrated within a cultural context. Tapati Guha Thakurta, a professor at the Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, voiced similar concerns when she opened the second plenary session, New Frontiers in Art and Museum Strategies.        
	Earlier, Kwok Kian Chow, the director of Singapore Art Museum, had sketched the problems of integration by invoking the Philippine example of bringing together Western and Vietnamese elements. While tensions in postcolonial traditions of representation may be apparent, the difficulties faced by European museums are subtler. Susanne Gaensheimer, director, Museum fr Moderne Kunst (MMK), Frankfurt, talked about how MMK curated its collections, from the 1960s to the present, in exciting ways. Various kinds of art, like the pop art of Roy Lichtenstein and the minimalism of Donald Judd, were often shown to be part of a coherent narrative.        
	London-based curator David Thorp spoke of his work on the Frank Cohen Collection, while Susanne Titz talked about the Stdtisches Museum Abteiberg, Germany, which she heads. Tasneem Zakaria Mehta, managing trustee and honorary director of Dr Bhau Daji Lad Museum, Mumbai, and artist Jitish Kallat discussed evolving models of organising and restructuring existing museums.                          
	New ventures also formed the core of the presentation by Jay A. Levenson, director of international program at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), New York. Since the program was founded in 1952, MoMA has organised shows with India, and now intends to deepen its collaboration.        
	KMOMA is expected to transform curating, preservation and the circulation of Indian art. To facilitate this process, MoMA wishes to start exchange programmes with India, enabling curators working here to exchange ideas with their US counterparts.        
	A cultural dialogue of this kind must coexist with adventurous thinking. Jyotindra Jain, professor at the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts, New Delhi, began his address by quoting the photographer, Dayanita Singh, who had once mentioned her search for alternative spaces to display her work. When she showed some portraits in peoples houses, neighbours came to watch, and engaged with the exhibits at a level of rare intimacy. So the modern museum must be a fluid space, straddling public and private spheres, making the one inseparable from the other.        
	Holding together these visions for a futuristic museum was an overarching awareness of the role of the corporate sector. While conceding that art cannot get sidetracked by financial indices, Rakhi Sarkar, head of the FICCI Committee on Art and Business of Art and managing trustee of KMOMA, lobbied for a change of policies that control the Indian art market. Mukesh Panika, director, Religare Arts Initiative, New Delhi, also highlighted the positives of corporate participation.        
	Artist Subodh Gupta was the guest of honour.        
	ENDS

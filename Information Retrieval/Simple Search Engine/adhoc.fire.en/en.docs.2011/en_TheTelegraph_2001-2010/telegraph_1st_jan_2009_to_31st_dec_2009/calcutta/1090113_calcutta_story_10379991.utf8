The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Small film set for big release
                                                                                                               Small film set for big release
  - globes give slumdog 007 muscle          PRATIM D. GUPTA                          HOT SEAT: Dev Patel shares the spotlight with quizmaster Anil Kapoor in Slumdog Millionaire                                        
	The countdown to the biggest quiz show on the big screen has begun. With 10 days to go for the India release of Slumdog Millionaire, the four-trophy sweep at the Golden Globe Awards has made a giant out of a just-another-India-centric movie. The small independent film will now open as big as a James Bond movie at the city plexes.        
	Come January 23 and the Danny Boyle film, punctuated with A.R. Rahmans pulsating music, will release with around six to seven daily multiplex shows. Recent English films to get such a release are the big studio movies like Quantum of Solace, Indiana Jones and Chronicles of Narnia.        
	Though the holiday Friday will have three Bolly-Tolly releases  Raaz 2, Antaheen and Jackpot  and Akshay Kumars biggie Chandni Chowk to China will only be a week old by then, Slumdog will not be slumming it out.        
	The recent turn of events, with the film winning so many awards everywhere, especially the Golden Globes, has really made Slumdog a hot favourite, says Mahendra Soni, whose Venkatesh Films is distributing the film in Bengal.        
	We will release the English film in the plexes and the dubbed Hindi version, titled Slumdog Crorepati, at the single screens. Fifteen prints for a film like this is really big, he adds.        
	The Slumdog fever has peaked on campus, with the storys protagonist all of 18. Says Jahan Bakshi, a mass communication student at St Xaviers College: The exciting combination of Danny Boyles kinetic style and the very-Bollywood theme has made the movie a must watch. All of us are sure to catch the film.        
	Even the competition on Friday is looking forward to a slice of Slumdog. Says Antaheen director Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury: I really want to watch it. A good film always helps another. I am lucky that my film is releasing on the same day.        
	Slumdogs co-director Loveleen Tandan has called India the acid test and the one thing working against it here could be Internet piracy that has led to the film being downloaded and viewed by many Calcuttans in the glow of the Globe nominations.

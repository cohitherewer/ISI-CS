                      Beauty and eternity                    A work of art is a joy forever not because it is a relic of an age or that it bears testimony to historical facts, but because of its quality of timeless essence. It is this eternal quality that marks the works of Debasish Ghosh. Though individual and personalised, his paintings have a universal tone and tenor that transcends the barriers of time. The ongoing solo exhibition of his works shows that he has reached a transitory phase in his evolution as an artist. Though he has evolved consistently in style, his current paintings are distinguished by a predominance of lines. Ghosh reflects his fundamental adherence to Indian aesthetic tradition, but retains his ability to express himself in a manner completely free from any affectation. Characterised by illusory, dreamy or sometimes even ghost-like figures of women, Ghoshs paintings, however, deal with realistic themes of daily life. His treatment of his subjects is also interesting in the way they blend reality and imagination, real images and mirror images, light and darkness. Beautiful in design and eternal in spirit, they are, ultimately, a testament to contemporary life and time.                  Event: An exhibition of paintings by Debasish Ghosh

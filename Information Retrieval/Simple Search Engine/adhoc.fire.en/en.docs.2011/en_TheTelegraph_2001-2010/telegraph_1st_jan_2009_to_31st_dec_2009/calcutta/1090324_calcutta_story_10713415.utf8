          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Sleuths claim to have identified Shahbaz Ismails contacts in the terror network and the role he was supposed to play as the Al Badar commander in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).        
	Ismail, said to be a key operative of the terror outfit, was arrested at Fairlie Place last Thursday.         
	The Pakistani national was allegedly on his way to Kashmir from Bangladesh.        
	We have gone through the emails he had sent and received and come to know about his contacts in Bangladesh, said an officer of the city polices special task force.        
	Ismail, who had served Pakistan Rangers as a head constable before joining the terror syndicate, was supposed to step into the shoes of Al Badar commander Mohammad Tamin, who died in an encounter with the Indian forces last year.        
	The officers have also come to know that Ismail was supposed to source a huge cache of arms and ammunition for his fight against the Indian forces from a supplier in Srinagar.

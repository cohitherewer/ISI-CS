          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A fire broke out in a transformer room at Medical College and Hospital on Tuesday morning, causing an hour-long blackout in three blocks of the hospital.        
	Services were disrupted at ICCUs, the emergency ward, operating theatres and the outpatients department. A cable fault is suspected to have caused the fire.        
	The fire broke out at 10.43am and two tenders doused the flames by 11am. A CESC team restored power at 11.52am.         
	Surgeries were deferred. Staff, patients and relatives faced problems, said medical superintendent Anup Roy.

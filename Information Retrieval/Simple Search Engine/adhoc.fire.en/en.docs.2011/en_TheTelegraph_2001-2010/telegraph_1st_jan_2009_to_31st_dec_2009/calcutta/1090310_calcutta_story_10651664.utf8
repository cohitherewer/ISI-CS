The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Auto chaos at crossroads 
                                                                                                               Auto chaos at crossroads 
                                          
	Illegal autorickshaw and taxi stands, hawkers, lack of proper bus stops, unruly traffic, a flyover under construction and pedestrian indifference make the Ultadanga-VIP Road-CIT Road crossing a nightmare for commuters. Metro runs a check:              
	Auto and taxi stands        
	Autos on seven routes ply from near the crossing. During rush hours hundreds of three-wheelers and taxis are parked on both sides of Ultadanga Main Road, often in three rows, eating into more than half the carriageway.        
	The crossing would have been far less chaotic if the stands were removed. Auto drivers are the worst as they have made a habit of flouting traffic rules, said a police officer.        
	I waste 15-20 minutes in trying to cross the intersection during rush hour, mainly because of the autos that block the approaches, said Anirban Samajpati, a 22-year-old BBA student.              
	Showpiece bays, bus stops        
	There are five designated bus stops on the roads to the intersection, yet bus drivers pick up passengers wherever they want to, even in the middle of the road.         
	The worst stretch is between the underpass on the northern flank of Ultadanga Main Road and the VIP Road bridge. In January, a bus mowed down three commuters, killing two, at the base of the bridge after climbing a pavement.                
	Hawker encroachment        
	Both footpaths of the three roads have been taken over by hawkers, forcing pedestrians to walk on the carriageway.        
	We cant ask people to use footpaths as hawkers occupy them, said a cop.        
	The northern flank of Ultadanga Main Road is in the worst state, with vendors squatting on both sides of the pavement and customers occupying the space in between.                
	Project delay        
	Snarls on VIP Road, near the mouth of the crossing, have become common since the police barricaded the slip bridge leading to the EM Bypass in July last year  to facilitate construction of pillars for a 1,290m flyover. The slip bridge was supposed to reopen in December but didnt.        
	The bumper-to-bumper snarl often stretches to Lake Town. The drive from Lake Town to Ultadanga, which used to take five minutes, now takes more than 20 minutes.         
	Till the slip bridge reopens, this stretch will remain a bottleneck, said Manzar Qaifi, a 36-year-old techie.              
	Pedestrian indifference        
	Less than five per cent of pedestrians use the footbridge near the crossing.        
	More often than not, pedestrians are responsible for the chaos, said a constable, pointing to scores of people crossing the road while vehicles were in motion.        
	Traffic lights for pedestrians are either absent or are ill-managed. The traffic volume is very high. Pedestrians hardly ever get a chance to cross the road, said Polly Santra, a 20-year-old beautician.              
	Official version        
	Officers at Ultadanga Traffic Guard said they did not have enough manpower to manage traffic at the intersection. There isnt much we can do under the current circumstances, said an officer.        
	Deputy commissioner (traffic) Dilip Banerjee said: There are some problems at Ultadanga but we conduct raids to keep things under control. Errant vehicles, mostly autos, are regularly booked and jaywalkers are slapped with fines up to Rs 50.

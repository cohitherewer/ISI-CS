The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Smoke ban lost on babus
                                                                                                               Smoke ban lost on babus
                                        
	The ban on smoking in public places came into effect on October 2 last year but Calcutta is yet to implement it effectively. The act bans smoking in all public and private workplaces, among others, and makes it mandatory for public places to put up 60cm x 30cm signboards saying No smoking area. Smoking here is an offence.        
	In Calcutta, government officials are the biggest offenders, lighting up freely inside their offices. On Tuesday, Metro visited three power centres in the city  Calcutta High Court, Writers Buildings and the civic headquarters. Here is how the ban is going up in smoke               
	Where: Calcutta High Court        
	What we saw: The corridors were lined with lawyers in black robes puffing away while holding animated discussions with colleagues. The corridors and staircases were strewn with cigarette butts and burnt matches.         
	Some lawyers were seen stepping out of the courtrooms between proceedings to drag a few puffs.        
	Reality check: The high court is monitored by closed-circuit cameras, yet no steps are taken to stop lawyers and court employees from smoking on the premises. When the ban came into effect in October, some No Smoking stickers were put up but they were torn down by lawyers. It is a pity that people who are supposed to be well-versed in law are flouting the ban, said a senior high court lawyer.               
	Where: Writers Buildings        
	What we saw: The babus at the state secretariat were found to be worthy competitors of the lawyers in flouting the ban. Smoking is rampant not just in the corridors of the red bastion but inside the rooms as well.        
	On Tuesday afternoon, Metro spotted an employee lighting up while leaving a room in the municipal affairs department. Near the transport department, on the third floor, the corridor was lined with babus puffing away to glory.        
	Reality check: We know that smoking is banned in public places but nobody has ever stopped us from lighting up inside Writers. You will hardly find any No Smoking signs and no one has been prosecuted till date. In fact, ministers and bureaucrats smoke inside their chambers. Why dont you go and question them, shot back an employee of the transport department who was caught on camera holding the cancer stick.              
	Where: Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC)        
	What we saw: At the civic headquarters on SN Banerjee Road, employees dont even bother stepping out of their office chambers for a smoke.        
	Metro spotted a senior official of the assessment department smoking inside his chamber during working hours. An official of the drainage department emerged from his room on the second floor and lit up in the corridor.        
	At 2.30pm, the corridors on the first and the second floors were teeming with people enjoying their post-lunch smoke and tea.        
	Reality check: Smoking increases productivity. Whenever I get stuck, I light a cigarette and I find my mind full of ideas, said an official of the civic health department, on the first floor of the building.               
	Health departments version: We are setting up committees to monitor the implementation of the ban and spread awareness among government officials. Like all things governmental, this will also take some time, a senior official of the health department said on condition of anonymity.        
	He admitted that such committees should have been formed earlier for effective implementation of the ban.

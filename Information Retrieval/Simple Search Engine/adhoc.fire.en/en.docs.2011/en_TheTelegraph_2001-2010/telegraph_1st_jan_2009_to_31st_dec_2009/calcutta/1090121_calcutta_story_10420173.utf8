                                                                                                               Court scan on tax slabs
  - Civic bill for flat jumps from 26,000 to 8 lakh in 4 years           OUR BUREAU                                                  
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC)s system of fixing property tax has come under the judicial scanner with the high court asking the civic body to explain in detail how it calculates the amount.        
	The CMCs building tax should be uniform. Officials have no right to fix taxes according to their whims, Justice Tapen Banerjee observed on Tuesday, following a petition by the two owners of a flat who are locked in a dispute with the CMC.        
	The civic authorities were also directed to submit an affidavit within four weeks, stating details of their tax policy.        
	The CMC had announced that the 1,100sq ft flat at 224A AJC Bose Road would be auctioned off as the owners had defaulted on paying the annual property tax of Rs 8 lakh.        
	The judge stayed the auction and asked the owners  Jagdish Prasad and Amit Kumar Kanoria  not to pay the tax till further orders.         
	The petitioners, who bought the eighth-floor flat in 2001, alleged that the authorities had violated the CMC Act in fixing their property tax and not served them proper notices while increasing the tax from Rs 26,200 in 2001-02 to Rs 1,99,800 the next year and Rs 8 lakh in 2005.        
	Civic sources said that till 2000, the property tax of a flat was a percentage of the notional rent calculated by assuming that the property had been rented out.         
	From 2001, the tax became a part of the annual valuation arrived at by multiplying the total square feet with a pre-determined amount that varied from one location to another.        
	From 2007, the tax is calculated as seven per cent of the stamp duty paid during registration of the property.                                                  
	Kanoriass lawyer Supradip Roy said the CMC, on being asked by his clients, had attributed the first hike in the tax to the fact that a part of the flat had been rented out to a private company, Krishna Agencies. The Kanorias paid the enhanced tax after pointing it out to the CMC that the company was owned by them, said Roy.  
	The CMC lawyer claimed that his clients had followed the letter of the law in fixing the property tax of the AJC Bose Road property.  
	 Supradip Roy, the lawyer for the Kanorias, said the CMC had attributed the first hike in the tax to the fact that a part of the flat had been rented out to a private company, Krishna Agencies. The Kanorias stopped paying the tax when the CMC raised it to Rs 8 lakh in 2005 and demanded that they and the firm operating from the flat be allowed to make a submission before the civic tax tribunal.  
	 ldquo;But they were not summoned before the panel. On January 14, the CMC sent a notice to my clients saying that if they failed to pay Rs 15 lakh as the first instalment of their outstanding property tax within 24 hours, the flat would be auctioned off, rdquo; said Roy.  
													 The owners immediately moved the high court, which scheduled the hearing for January 20. ldquo;A CMC team turned up on January 15 and asked my clients to vacate the flat. We called Karaya police after which the CMC team backed out, rdquo; said Roy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Street-smart police run parallel plazas
                                                                                                               Street-smart police run parallel plazas
  - SPOT THE WHEELER-DEALER										      A STAFF REPORTER      PARKING PLOTS                                                
	A permanent parking space in Calcuttas choked central business district will be created for you where none exists if you can wheel and deal with the cop in command on any street.        
	For every legal parking slot in the polices backyard, several more are illegally sold every day to those willing to pay a premium.         
	This is how it works here. If you have a problem with it, be prepared to go around in circles and never find a place to park, warned an attendant at a parking lot.        
	Not that we didnt know.        
	Metro approached an officer at a spot barely 300 metres from Lalbazar on Thursday to buy a parking slot and was told that it could be organised. Heres how the conversation went:        
	How much do I need to pay to park my vehicle on this stretch every day?        
	Officer: Who are you?        
	I am a businessman with an office on Radhabazar Street.        
	Officer: Ok. I will tell you everything in detail after August 15. Take it from me, nobody can give you space before that.        
	At least give me a monthly estimate...         
	Officer: Mota-moti 1,500 taka lagbe (You will have to pay around Rs 1,500).         
	Are you a sergeant?        
	Officer: (Laughing) Star to tai bole (The star on my uniform says so).        
	What if one of your colleagues slaps a case on me for illegal parking?        
	Officer: At times, we are forced to slap cases on vehicles parked in these crowded areas. In the event of a raid by a senior officer you will have to be prepared to pay Rs 100-150 extra.        
	Look whos parking        
	An officer in the traffic control room confirmed that over 30 vehicles were being parked illegally every day on both flanks of the no-parking stretch near Nakhoda Masjid, on Rabindra Sarani.        
	The northern flank of Phears Lane from the Rabindra Sarani side is another no-parking zone, but nearly 100 goods vehicles are allowed to be parked there for a price.         
	The police also allow vehicles to be illegally parked on the southern flank of Old Court House Street, near the approach to RN Mukherjee Road and the Bentinck Street crossing.        
	Motorcycles are not allowed to be parked on RN Mukherjee Road and Radhabazar Street, adjacent to Lalbazar, but over 60 two-wheelers can be seen there on any given day.        
	Mayoral council member Faiyaz Ahmed Khan said the Calcutta Municipal Corporation was losing out on revenue because of the illegal parking system.        
	He said a section of officers was allowing more cars than the stipulated number into parking plazas in the heart of the city and pocketing almost the entire extra revenue. All legal parking lots are owned by the civic body, which leases them out to co-operatives.

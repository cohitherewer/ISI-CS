The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fare slash rides diesel price snip
                                                                                                               Fare slash rides diesel price snip
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	The state government on Friday decided to lower sales tax on diesel by 1.07 per cent  29 paise  and reduce bus, minibus and taxi fares.        
	The sales tax slash will be effective from Saturday night and the revised fares from February 10, finance minister Asim Dasgupta and transport minister Subhas Chakraborty jointly announced at Writers Buildings after a meeting with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.        
	So, from Saturday night diesel will cost Rs 32.91, still down by Re 1 instead of Rs 2 elsewhere in the country.        
	When the Centre had raised the diesel price in June, the state government had reduced the sales tax on the fuel from 17 per cent to 12.5 per cent. On January 29, when the price of diesel was lowered, the government reverted to the pre-June sales tax rate. So, even though the price of diesel was reduced by Rs 2 per litre by the Centre all over the country on Thursday, in Calcutta, the slash was effectively 71 paise. Till an additional 29 paise slash on Friday.        
	The revised bus, minibus and taxi fares (see box) were rattled off by the transport minister. I hope that the operators organisations will accept the reduced fares, said Chakraborty.        
	There was no sign of acceptance from transporters on Friday with the revised fare being labelled arbitrary, unfair and unacceptable.        
	Swarnakamal Saha, the president of the Bengal Bus Syndicate, said: We dont accept this revision. The government cannot hand out revised fare charts without discussing the matter with us.        
	Taxi, bus and minibus operators said they would conduct several meetings over the next few days to thwart the governments move. Such a fare cut is unacceptable as the diesel price in Bengal has come down by only a rupee, said Sadhan Das, the general secretary of the Joint Council of Bus Syndicates.        
	The sudden slash in the minimum fare is absurd, said Bimal Guha, the general secretary of the Bengal Taxi Association.        
	One arm of the ruling party flexed its muscles for the implementation of the fare revision. Bus operators must reduce fares as asked by the government, stressed Citu state secretary Kali Ghosh.

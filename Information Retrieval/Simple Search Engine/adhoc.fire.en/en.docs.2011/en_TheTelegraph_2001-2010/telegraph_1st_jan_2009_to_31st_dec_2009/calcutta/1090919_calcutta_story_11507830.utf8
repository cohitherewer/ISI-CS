The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cop salute for courage
                                                                                                               Cop salute for courage
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Shreyasee Bhaduri                                  
	A woman who dragged an eve-teaser by the collar to cops, a pool car driver who stood up to armed goons and a man who jumped into the Hooghly to save a drowning baby were the stars of the annual police bravery awards on Friday.         
	The 16 Calcuttans felicitated by the chief minister at Sisir Mancha included five students who showed honesty and excellence in traffic management during the traffic-safety week. The awardees were given certificates, a memento and a cheque for Rs 5,000.        
	One of them, a 30-year-old working woman named Shreyasee Bhaduri had dragged a man to police by the collar through bustling Esplanade after he made a lewd gesture at her. I was surprised at being selected. I hope the award encourages others to protest whenever they are harassed on the road, she said.        
	Another braveheart, Binod Jaiswara, was shot at after he protested against three motorcycle-borne youths teasing the girls travelling in his pool car.        
	Police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti announced Jaiswara has been offered a job as a Home Guard.        
	Sanat Bawal, a trader, was felicitated for jumping into the Hooghly, near Dakshineswar, and rescuing a two-year-old baby who had fallen off his mothers lap.

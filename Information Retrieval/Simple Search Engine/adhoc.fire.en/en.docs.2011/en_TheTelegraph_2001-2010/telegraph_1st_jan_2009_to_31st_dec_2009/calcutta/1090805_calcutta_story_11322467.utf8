The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Policeman in road scuffle
                                                                                                               Policeman in road scuffle
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A scuffle between Topsia residents and police disrupted traffic on Gobinda Khatik Road and EM Bypass for half an hour on Tuesday evening.         
	The trouble started around 8.45pm, after a passenger on a Calcutta Tram Company bus got into a brawl with the driver.        
	A sergeant on patrol intervened along with a constable. The sergeant allegedly hit the passenger and was immediately punched in the face. The officer then hit the passenger with his helmet, said witnesses.        
	Local residents then got involved in the dispute and tried to damage the bus. A police contingent brought the situation under control around 9.15pm.

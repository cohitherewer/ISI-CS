The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Graffiti writ large on walls 
                                                                                                               Graffiti writ large on walls 
          POULOMI BANERJEE                                          
	If the CPM was first off the blocks in defacing city walls, the Trinamul Congress was not far behind. Metro toured south Calcutta on Wednesday and found the handiwork of both parties on walls.              
	Address: C/2 RK Upanibas in Jadavpur        
	Writing on the wall: CPM candidate Sujan Chakraborty        
	Wall leads to: A shop belonging to the Das family        
	Permission talk: Yes, they asked me and I gave them verbal permission. It is a convention and they are all local people, so I dont really mind as long as they are not writing anything offensive. Sometimes they clean the wall after the polls and sometimes we do it on our own, said Biswajit Das, whose father owns the shop.        
	Chakrabortys name has been painted on a wall adjacent to C/30 RK Upanibas, diagonally opposite the shop. Gopal Das, who owns the STD booth at C/30, said the wall belonged to the neighbouring grocery shop, which was closed.              
	Address: 571 VIP Nagar, Tiljala, along the EM Bypass        
	Writing on the wall: Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee        
	Wall leads to: Ananda Marga School        
	Permission talk: No one sought our permission initially but then we had a talk with the party people and have sorted out the matter. We have no objection now and have given our permission in writing. They will clean the wall after the polls, said principal A. Acharya.                 
	Address: 34 Durgapur Colony, New Alipore        
	Writing on the wall: CPM candidate Rabin Deb        
	Wall leads to: The Chakraborty residence         
	Permission talk: Yes, we have given them verbal permission. Theres no need for written permission. They are all local boys and I have known them since they were kids. We share a very comfortable relationship. No one will say anything if I scold them. And I too dont mind if they write on the wall. Theyll clean it after the polls, said Shankar Chakraborty, a family member.              
	Address: 71A Alipore Road        
	Writing on the wall: Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee        
	Wall leads to: Mangalam Apartments        
	Permission talk: No one asked for our permission. It is common for the parties to paint such graffiti on walls before the polls. They have been doing it for years, said caretaker Vinod Mishra.        
	None of the residents had asked him to stop the wall from being tarnished. The secretary of the estate was not available for comment.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Climate impact on wetlands
                                                                                                               Climate impact on wetlands

	Back from Ghoramara, a small island in the Sunderbans that is going under water because of climate change, governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi recently asked the environment department about the impact of climate change on the wetlands in the state.        
	The environment department responded with a detailed presentation on the matter, laying down the concerns about the wetlands, also enumerated by the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change, headed by R.K. Pachauri) in 2007.        
	With predicted temperature increase, most of the water bodies are expected to be more susceptible to eutrophication (filling up of the water body with aquatic plants), said the environment department presentation.        
	It also indicated that the character of water bodies may change, which is being already observed in the Sunderbans.        
	There can be a whole list of possible impacts of climate change on the wetlands; from invasion of alien plant species to loss of biodiversity of native species, from decline of water level to extinction of fish and other animal species less tolerant to thermal change, said a senior official of the department. Fishery may be a big casualty of climate change.        
	Admitting the trend to grab wetlands for building highrises across the state indirectly, the presentation observed that multiple (non-climatic) stresses acting on wetlands make adaptation to climate change difficult and added that the first step of adaptation in West Bengal would be to relieve these non-climatic pressures.         
	The non-climatic pressures have been identified as discharge of industrial and city waste into water bodies, fragmentation of water courses, over-harvesting and reclamation.        
	The governor was extremely keen and had a lot of queries and we tried to respond to them, said an official.        
	We have also shared with the governor the initiatives taken by the government to safeguard the wetlands, including the East Calcutta Wetlands, from climate change and various other pressures, said M.L. Meena, the principal secretary of the environment department.        
	We informed him about the launch of a water mission to increase efficiency of water use apart from the constitution of the West Bengal Wetlands Authority, which is under way, said Meena.

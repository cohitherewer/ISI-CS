          A STAFF REPORTER                          A bus set ablaze on AJC Bose Road, near Minto Park, on Thursday. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                  
	Police remained mute spectators as protesters went on the rampage across the city on Thursday, inconveniencing thousands of commuters, including students.        
	As vehicles stood bumper-to-bumper on many arteries for most part of the day, the worst-hit were children on their way to school or back home.        
	Roads were blocked in at least 40 places but nowhere were cops seen making any attempt to restore order. Sources in the police headquarters said no special arrangement had been made to deal with the crisis though trouble started spreading from 10.30am.        
	Of the 143 people arrested at the end of the day, charges were slapped on only seven. We had no order to take stern action against the protesters, said an officer of Muchipara police station, under whose jurisdiction falls Sealdah where two buses were damaged.        
	A mob set a West Bengal Surface Transport Corporation bus on fire on Bijon Setu. We rushed to the spot only to see the flames, said an officer of Gariahat police station. Another state bus was set ablaze near Minto Park but the cops had no information.        
	Apart from the seven arrests in Sealdah, no one was rounded up for todays vandalism, said Jawed Shamim, deputy commissioner, detective department.        
	Thanks to the vandalism, many school students could not write their class tests.        
	I started from my Bypass home around 10.45am to drop my son at his Southern Avenue school. We reached Jadavpur police station around 11.15am but remained stranded there till 12.30pm. We had no option but to return as the school starts at 11.50am. My son could not sit for his unit test, said the mother of a Class IV student of Nava Nalanda School.         
	Sources in Calcutta Girls High School, Birla High School for Boys and Welland Gouldsmith said anxious parents kept calling through the day enquiring about their children.        
	We heard around noon that Howrah bridge was closed. I got worried and frantically tried to speak to my daughter, who studies in Class III in Welland Gouldsmith School, said Nita Bagaria, a resident of GT Road in Salkia.        
	Malini Bhagat, the principal of Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School, said the chaos had caused great inconvenience to her students. Three of the schools buses had to return with students.        
	The forest department had arranged for a tram ride for the students of Calcutta Girls High School which started at 9am. The students were supposed to be back by 3.         
	The ride had to be ended midway following calls from parents, said a teacher of the school.        
	Calcutta University officials said several BA Part II examinees called from roads saying they could not reach the test venues. We asked them to lodge complaints signed by their principals, said an official.

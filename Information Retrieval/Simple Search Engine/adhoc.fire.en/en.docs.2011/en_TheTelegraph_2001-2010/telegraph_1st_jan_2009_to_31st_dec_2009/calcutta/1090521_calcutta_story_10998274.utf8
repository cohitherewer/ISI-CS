                      Art for world peace                    Italian architect Niccola Strippoli took the name of Tarshito during his first visit to India in 1979. He merges his western design sensibility with the iconographies and materials of India through a creative meditational practice. Profoundly impressed by the diversity and richness of Indian craft traditions, his production encompasses painting (both large-scale and miniature), sculpture, drawing, textiles, jewellery and applied design. The Vase and the Lines, the ongoing solo exhibition of his new works, showcases a range that demonstrates the artists amazing breadth of practice. Large wall-mounted works use texts (in both English and Italian), paintings and textiles to create banners promoting world unity. Golden vases and hybridised maps (with India and Italy joined together to create a new continent, for instance) are paired with robustly striped textiles from Nagaland, bearing the message of universal peace and harmony. In his smaller works, Tarshito combines text, vases and brushwork to create paintings that are both spontaneous and meditative. Also on display are a number of works using ceramics that the artist has made while in Calcutta. Tarshito uses the fish as a symbol of peace and freedom. He combines schools of them together in different colours to create striped relief works and as the skin of vase forms. The vase, which occurs repeatedly in Tarshitos work, is a symbol of the self as a receptacle, open to the sky and ready to receive.                  lEvent: An exhibition of new works by Tarshito lWhen: Till May 24; 11 am - 7 pm lWhere: Bose Pacia, Stephen Court, 18 Park Street

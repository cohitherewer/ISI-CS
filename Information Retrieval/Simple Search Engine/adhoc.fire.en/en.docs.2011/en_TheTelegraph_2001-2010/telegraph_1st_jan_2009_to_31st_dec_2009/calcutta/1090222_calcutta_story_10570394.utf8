										      A Rs 70-crore plan to revive Indian Museum is on the anvil. Will it help?                       The Elgin Marbles at British Museum (courtesy British Museum) and Bharhut Gallery at Indian Museum (below). Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha				                           
	The Park Street flyover was the worst thing that could have happened to Indian Museum, blocking it from public view. Its original plans were drawn up by WL Granville, and it struck such awe among the local people that it won the sobriquet jadughar. Granville was responsible for several important buildings in Calcutta, notably the General Post Office and the high court.              
	Even the flyover couldnt mar the museums dignified simplicity. But if the vision and development committee formed for the renovation of Indian Museum has its way, it may, in the near future, acquire a crown that would stick out a mile, possibly plunging the city into another identity crisis as yet another landmark becomes unrecognisable.         
	After decades of neglect the Centre, if it receives a suitable renovation plan, means to pump in about Rs 70 crore just five years ahead of Indian Museums bicentenary in 2014. Barun De, the chairman of the vision and development committee for Indian Museum, who also chairs the West Bengal Heritage Commission and is a member of the Heritage Conservation Committee of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, says: Montek Singh Ahluwalia, the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, visited the museum about two years ago, and moved by its sorry state announced that he was willing to allocate Rs 100 crore apiece to each large museum in the three metros if they came up with a renovation plan.        
	But the then director of Indian Museum did little about it, and the brouhaha over the theft of a Buddha head in December 2004 shifted the focus. The recent CBI inquiry against one of its directors has not helped matters.        
	Mansard on top        
	The vision and development committee formed last year has drawn up a plan for renovation, says De. Under the plan, to be submitted to the Centre shortly, the museum will be given a new look. The group of architects who have been shortlisted have suggested a mansard roof (the sloping roof seen on top of Writers Buildings, (picture in box below) that will add to the beauty. There will be internal alterations to make more space for display. Plus a cafeteria and a bookshop. The tank will be resuscitated and activities planned around it to make it a happening place. It is estimated to be a Rs 70-crore project, adds De.         
	In the last 30-40 years there has been a shift in the concept of the museum  from an academic ivory tower it has become a place for edutainment.         
	The challenge is to create a museum-community interface. There should be an active involvement between the university and the museum. We have to increase gallery lectures, make galleries more interactive, encourage research, install better lighting, have things like touch screens to help visitors read about the exhibits, says K.K. Basa, the museums current director, who has served in a museum in Bhopal.        
	More than 60 years after Independence, the museum remains a Victorian showpiece. The mammoth blue whale skeleton and the Egyptian mummy are still crowdpullers. Even Anuradha Mookerjee, the director of the Eastern Zonal Cultural Complex and acting director of Indian Museum before Basa took over, listed the two exhibits as the big draws.        
	Real treasures        
	A spokesperson of British Museum says in an email: The collections of Indian Museum are world-renowned, not least on account of the presence there of the early Buddhist sculptures of the medieval period from Bharhut. Also, the location of outstanding sculptures of the medieval period from eastern India as well as paintings ranging over some eight centuries, make Indian Museum of international importance.        
	How much of it will be restored by the new plan?         
	Partha Das amp; Associates, shortlisted along with architects Ashish Acharjee and Anindya Basu to make the changes, talks about more details. None of them is a qualified conservation architect.        
	Das plans to add a forum space on the top floor, basement reserves and laboratory and better and theatrical lighting so that radiation does not harm the exhibits and visibility is enhanced. Air quality and fire safety measures will be improved, and a hi-tech surveillance system will also be installed.         
	A comparison        
	Will the measures be enough? It is absurd to try to replicate international models. But perhaps the contrast between British Museum, one of the major museums of the world that enjoys a footfall of 6 million annually where admission is free, and Indian Museum, visited by 453,299 people in 2008-January 2009, could be an indication of how far Indian Museum has to go.         
	According to the British Museum spokesperson, the museum acquires objects on a regular basis to keep the collections representative and dynamic. A new acquisition is registered and given an object number and is logged onto departmental inventories and onto a museum-wide system. The museum has been working in the past decade to widen access to the collection through the website, with the result that over one million of the objects in its collection are currently available online  www.britishmuseum.org. Not surprising since it has had an inventory of one kind or another since its foundation in 1753.         
	Anuradha Mookerjee admitted that Indian Museum does have an inventory but it is very scattered. We are now going in for a digitised record and creating a general access register.        
	The museums website, last updated on January 31, 2005, is a joke. Splattered with typographical errors, most of the visuals dont render.        
	The Bharhut gallery with its 23 ft high gateway is the museums showpiece, and it would not be far-fetched to compare it with the Parthenon Gallery of British Museum where the Elgin Marbles are displayed. But sans a signboard, it is easily missed.        
	British Museum is independent of government, though funding is given to it from the department of culture, media and sport (a government department). The museum is governed by a 25-member board of trustees. The Centre has the last word on everything, including staff appointment, in Indian Museum.        
	British Museums concept has not changed in its 250-year history. The museum is and always has existed to present a unique view of world civilisations, the spokesperson added.         
	Physically, Indian Museum is in a mess. Its rooftop covers 6,000 sq mt, and the ante-diluvian plumbing lines are not adequate to expel rainwater that collects on the roof. The cellars in which the archaeological artefacts are stored do not get flooded any longer but storage facilities need to be improved. Space crunch is severe and only one-tenth of its more than a million artefacts are on display.         
	Notwithstanding the theft of the Buddha head in December 2004, security is a pathetic affair with lathi and metal detector-toting guards acting as Cerberus. Mookerjee said CISF would be deployed.         
	So what led to the dismal state of the museum? Apathetic directors alone cannot be blamed. Basa hits the nail on the head when he says: I wont say that there has been a financial crunch or neglect. The problem is that because of the layers of protocols, it takes time to do anything. For example, a simple architectural renovation cant be done quickly because it is a heritage building.        
	The British Museum website reveals the name of all the 25 trustees on the governing board. Even the scandal involving the cleaning of the Elgin Marbles in the 1930s is clearly documented.         
	Indian Museum should be on display in its full glory. As Basa says: The community is the new curator of the cultural heritage.    
	GALLERY VIEW            The sun-kissed showcase with Indian miniatures. (Sanat Kumar Sinha)    
	Indian Museum rsquo;s galleries are in a miserable state. Here are some glaring examples.  
	 The zoological gallery houses bones of the blue whale and elephants along with moth-eaten stuffed birds and beasts.The insect gallery and the invertebrate fossil gallery are Victorian relics laden with dust. A fossilised tree trunk was lying in the open on the first floor verandah. It does not need an expert to tell that the ceilings of these galleries have suffered an extreme form of degeneration. A chunk had fallen off the ceiling recently. Fortunately, there were no visitors around. The painting gallery is dark and one has to strain one rsquo;s eyes to take in the details of the masterpieces of Bengal, Mughal, Deccani, Rajasthani, Golkonda and Persian art on display.The glass showcases in which they are displayed are cobwebby and dusty. But are the authorities really so concerned about these delicate works on paper that they have ensured that this gallery remains in half light? Not really. Sunlight streamed in through one of the windows facing Chowringhee, and sunlight, as everybody knows, could be the death of fragile art work.      RAISING THE ROOF      
	Thanks to the Rs 70 crore that the Centre plans  to invest in Indian Museum, this institution that  will turn 200 in 2014, will undergo a sea change.  Partha Das and Associates, an architects firm, is  set to become the agent of change. Besides  suggesting the usual measures for restoring and  strengthening the old edifice, and creating other  modern amenities to make the museum more  people-friendly, the most drastic (some would say  disastrous) change that it has proposed is adding a  mansard roof that will rise head and shoulders  above the flyover in front of it.    According to the firm, the Town Hall and the museum  are of about the same age and have a similar  construction. Both are made of load-bearing brick.  quot;There has to be minimum intervention. We will  continue with the lime plaster, quot; Das says. The museum  will be divided into display area, forum space  for seminars and programmes and material that  will be made available digitally to visitors. The  quadrangle will be converted into a covered bigscale  archaeological space. The ground floor will be  devoted to art, architecture, history and anthropology.  On the first floor will be the science and natural  history galleries. The second floor will house the  donor galleries. There will be a bookshop, library,  cafeteria and a parking lot for 200 cars. The tank  will be landscaped.    All this is fine, save for the mansard roof, which the  firm claims was designed by Walter Granville, but  had to be abandoned owing to a funds crunch. The  book published by the Indian Museum trustees on  the occasion of its centenary celebrations does  refer to quot;This design was based on the original one  by Granville that was left uncompleted in 1877. It  was grandiose in style with copper 'mansards' and  an abundance of architectural sculpture. quot;  But Das neglected to mention that the same book  also says: quot;It was first intended that a third floor  should be built along the front, in addition to the  two already completed; but funds gave out, and in  any case the ominous cracks that appeared in the  building owing to the unstable nature of the ground  on which it was founded, would probably at the  time have rendered this impossible. quot;  
	 Any conservation architect worth his salt would  know that adding a superstructure to an almost  200-year-old building could only spell disaster.  A.G.K. Menon, conservation architect and convener  of the Delhi chapter of Intach, said in a telephone  interview: quot;Heritage character cannot be altered  drastically. A mansard roof is an entirely different  typology and the decision to change it is more  whimsical than rational. quot;  
	 Told about Granville's quot;original quot; plan, Menon said:  quot;The original intent of the architect may be what it  was, but today we have inherited a heritage building,  and there are clear guidelines on how to deal  with heritage, and they do not include recreation of  the architect's imagination. quot;  Philip Davies, planning and development director  (South) English Heritage, that manages the historical  built heritage of England, expressed his fear that the  addition of the roof would quot;endanger the integrity of  a fine building quot; that is important quot;both architecturally  and culturally quot; not only for Calcutta but for India  as well. Such major decisions can only be taken after  quot;widespread public consultation and inquiry quot;.          POULOMI BANERJEE

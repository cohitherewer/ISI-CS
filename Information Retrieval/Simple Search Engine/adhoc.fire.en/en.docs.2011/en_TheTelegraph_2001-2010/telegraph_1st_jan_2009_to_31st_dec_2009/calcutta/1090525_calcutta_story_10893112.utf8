The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Lives lost for lack of organ harvest
                                                                                                               Lives lost for lack of organ harvest
          G.S. MUDUR IN NEW DELHI                                            
	Each time a family grieving a death turns away social activist Brojo Roy, gastroenterologist Abhijit Chowdhury of SSKM Hospital sees a ray of hope fade for some of his patients with terminal liver disease.        
	Roy, campaigning for body donations for medical science, routinely approaches the families of patients declared brain dead  and thus lost forever  seeking permission for surgeons to take their organs: a liver, two kidneys, and perhaps a heart.        
	At least eight times over the past few months, the families of brain dead persons from Calcutta or neighbouring districts have declined  usually politely, at times in anger.         
	Each such refusal snaps a potential lifeline for a patient elsewhere in the city.        
	A 50-year-old woman with end-stage liver disease died at SSKM Hospital a little more than a month ago after waiting nearly four months for a liver transplantation.        
	We had five potential donors  each brain dead, said Chowdhury, a liver specialist at SSKM. But we lost her. People still dont understand the concept of brain death. They mistakenly believe a beating heart always means hope.        
	Nearly 15 years after the Centre passed a law to allow organ harvesting from the brain dead, the rates of organ transplants from cadavers in India are still among the lowest in the world (see chart).         
	The most common cause of death is cardiac arrest  the heart stops pumping blood and other organs of the body, including the brain, fail one after another within minutes of cessation of the heart.         
	But a small number of patients  typically those with severe head injuries or tumours or a stroke in a critical part of the brain called brain stem  lose, irreversibly, their capacity for consciousness and breathing.        
	A patient who is in hospital when brain death occurs may be maintained on a ventilator to keep the heart beating and the lungs breathing. Such a beating heart cadaver is the ideal source of organs, said Samiran Nundy, a gastrointestinal surgeon who was a key architect of the 1994 law on transplantation and is now coordinating a network of Delhi hospitals to facilitate cadaver transplantation.        
	Experts estimate that about 2,500 kidney transplants and between 100 and 150 liver transplants are conducted in the country each year.        
	But over the past decade, less than 1,500 transplants have involved organs from cadavers.        
	Doctors say it is hard to shatter old beliefs  and practices. Families dont know about brain death, and doctors may be scared to declare patients brain dead... they may be worried about perceptions of family members, said Chowdhury.        
	But the results of a decade-long non-government initiative called the Multi Organ Harvesting Aid Network (MOHAN) operating in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh has kindled hopes that change may be possible in other states too.        
	MOHAN has distributed nearly 100,000 donor cards  that allow people to assert that their organs may be harvested by surgeons should they ever be declared brain dead. Its a model for the rest of the country, Nundy said.        
	Families are now coming on their own, said Sunil Shroff, a professor of urology and renal transplantation at the Sri Ramachandra Medical College, Chennai. Over the past six months, Tamil Nadu has seen more than 24 cadaver transplants. Its much easier to convince families when theyre already sensitised to brain death, said Shroff. You need sustained public education for that.        
	Chowdhury says its frustrating to watch patients die while waiting for organs, more so because donors surface, but remain unavailable. Weve tried to inspire families, telling them this is something like reincarnation  the tissues and organs will live again. We tell families someone has to create history. We can offer nothing but a societal gun salute.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | State buses let down commuters
                                                                                                               State buses let down commuters
          TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                              
	Not a single state bus plied in the city on Friday, stumping those who stepped out of their homes banking on the chief secretarys word that the fleet would be on the road during the bandh. Private operators, too, withdrew their buses fearing mob attacks.        
	The transport secretary met me in the morning and said the government bus employees had decided not to operate the vehicles to protest Thursdays vandalism. I am really sorry for the people, who left their homes because of my assurance that government buses would ply, said chief secretary Ashok Mohan Chakrabarti on Friday.        
	Seventeen buses were damaged by mobs on Thursday.        
	About 1,100 Calcutta State Transport Corporation (CSTC) and Calcutta Tram Company (CTC) buses ply in the city daily. Over 500 of the buses plied on bandh days in the past.        
	The drivers did not dare to drive the buses out of the depots after what happened on Thursday, said a CSTC official at the 8B depot.        
	We were instructed to not operate buses. Thursdays vandalism scared us, said a senior official of CTC on condition of anonymity.        
	The 9,000 private buses that ply in the city on an average day also went missing.        
	When the government itself did not dare operate vehicles, how could we take a chance? asked Swarnakamal Saha of the Calcutta Metropolitan Bus and Minibus Owners Association.        
	The lack of transport options forced many office-goers to return home after a long wait at bus stands. I cant remember another bandh where not a single bus could be seen on the road, said Ranadhir Sikdar, a resident of Bangur Avenue, who was desperately trying to reach Phoolbagan to visit an ailing relative.

                                                                                                               Missing boy returns home
          SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE                               
	The parents of a schoolboy missing from his Barasat home heaved a sigh of relief when he returned on Sunday morning, a day after Class II student Yash Lakhotia who went missing was found murdered near his Howrah home.        
	Simul Sen, a Class VII student, left home on Thursday evening after his mother scolded him for neglecting his studies and devoting too much time to Saraswati puja preparations in the locality.         
	My mother said I could participate in the Saraswati puja only if I completed a mathematics lesson, Simul told Metro at his Barasat home on Sunday.        
	Fearing that he would miss all the fun by staying home, Simul decided to visit his friends house in Hasnabad, 60km from Barasat.         
	Simul reached Barasat railway station at 7.30pm, said an officer of Barasat police station.        
	At the station, the boy said he had met an unknown man who gave him sweets and asked him to wait for him. But the man didnt return and Simul spent the night at the station.         
	The next day he took a morning train to Hasnabad and spent Friday and Saturday at his friends house, taking part in the puja and enjoying with friends, police said.        
	On Friday, Simuls parents lodged a missing complaint.        
	Simul decided to return home on Sunday and boarded the train at 5.30am. On the train, a hawker  Swapan Das  recognised him from media reports and escorted the boy to his Nabapally residence, fearing he might flee again.         
	He has never behaved like this. We will be more careful in dealing with him, said Sureshkanti, Simuls father and a house-painting contractor.         
	I will never do something like this again, said Simul.

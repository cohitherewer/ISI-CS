	Calcutta and Calcuttans have always worn, with barely hidden pride, their self-bestowed badge of the most avid book lovers. Nowhere has a book fair divided a city between book lovers and green crusaders.         
	The book-loving tag has been reinforced by Calcuttas bid for the Unesco City of Literature status. And now we have a book commemorating Calcuttas bibliophile citizens.         
	Kolkata, Book City, an anthology of writings is a true Calcutta-Scotland connection. The book has been published by Scottish publisher Textualities and one of its editors, Jennie Renton, is based in Edinburgh while the second editor, Sria Chatterjee, and the contributors all from Calcutta.         
	Celebrating its release at a city bookstore were the editors and contributors of this volume and a distinguished panel. Professor Hari Vasudevan remembered RK DasGupta, one of the most revered bibliophiles of the city, who died on February 9. Author and creator of the Phataru genre, Nabarun Bhattacharya spoke about how a book he had bought for Rs 2 from College Street, Conversations with Nelson Algren, changed his life. I obtained Algrens Chicago address and wrote to him. He not only wrote back but sent two crates of books. I gathered courage, translated two of my books and sent them to him. He wrote back a scathing criticism saying I was looking at life through the wrong end of the telescope. It changed everything.        
	Critic Samik Bandopadhyay spoke about the thriving second-hand market of books. Publisher Mandira Sen said the book had a distinctive presence of the cultural text people from a certain university. She mentioned the piece on Signet Press and the man behind it, D.K. Gupta, who, Sen said: Anticipated so many years ago everything that Samikda (Bandyopadhyay) and Navin Kishore has done with Seagull.         
	The piece on printer Prabhat Kumar Ghosh, she said, narrated how he would pick out errors right before the book went to press and get them corrected.                     ANASUYA BASU

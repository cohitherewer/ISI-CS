          A STAFF REPORTER                          Damaged equipment of the troupe. (Gopal Senapati)                                   
	A mini-truck overturned on National Highway 6 near Domjur, killing one and injuring 11 on Friday morning.        
	The vehicle was carrying an 11-member jatra troupe home to Kakdwip after a show in Midnapore on Thursday. Around 11.40am, the truck overturned on Nibra bridgewhile negotiating a sharp bend. It vaulted in the air several times before landing nearly 30 metres away.        
	Troupe member Pradip Haldar, 30, was crushed under the truck. The others, including the driver, were injured, four of them critically.        
	The driver was at fault. He was speeding at the sharp turn. There could have been more casualties, said Pradip Sengupta, a passerby who helped take the injured to hospital.        
	A rescue team from the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) sent the victims to Howrah district hospital, where Haldar, a resident of Kulpi, was declared dead.        
	Police said the bend was accident prone. The NHAI should place speed-breakers near the bend to prevent accidents, said an officer.        
	Local residents demanded cops be deployed near the bend to check speeding.

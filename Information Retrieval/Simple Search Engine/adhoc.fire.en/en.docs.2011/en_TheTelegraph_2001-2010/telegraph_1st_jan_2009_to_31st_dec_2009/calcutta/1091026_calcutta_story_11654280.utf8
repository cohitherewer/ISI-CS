The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Red tape keeps youth in jail
                                                                                                               Red tape keeps youth in jail
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                            A release order from Calcutta High Court (top) failed to reach Presidency jail (below) even after a month                                 
	A lifer acquitted a month ago is still languishing in custody as a copy of the high court order has not reached the jail.         
	Thirty-four days have passed since the high court ordered the Presidency jail authorities to immediately release Amal Majumdar, a 32-year-old from Bandel who had been sentenced to a life term by a sessions judge, but the order is yet to be executed.        
	Amals elderly parents Anil and Basanti, who too had been accused of abetting their daughter-in-laws suicide, have been pushed from pillar to post since September but are still clueless about when their son will be released.        
	While the jail authorities denied receiving a copy of the order, the high court registrar- general could not shed light on the long delay in releasing Amal when Anil and Basanti met him last week.         
	When Metro contacted the registrar-general, he said: I am trying to locate the case file. We have been left with few options other than to move the high court again, said Amals brother-in-law Shibu Das.        
	A sessions court in Chinsurah, Hooghly, had convicted Amal in 2002 for allegedly abetting his wife Krishnas suicide and awarded him the life sentence.         
	A division bench of the high court, while disposing of the appeal moved by Amal against the trial courts order, held that there was not enough proof against him. The bench, on September 22, asked the jail authorities to release Amal forthwith.        
	The high courts month-long Puja vacation started on September 23, so we went to Presidency jail with a copy of the order. But the jail authorities said they had not received the order. Since then, we have been to the jail almost every day, but to no avail, said Shibu.        
	Amal, an autorickshaw driver, married Krishna, a resident of Chinsurah, in January 1997. After Krishna died in May that year, her father Harendranath Sarkar lodged a police complaint accusing Amal, Anil, Basanti and Amals sister Pushpa Mondal of torturing his daughter for dowry.        
	The sessions judge sentenced Anil and Basanti to seven years in jail and acquitted Pushpa. Amals parents were released two years ago after serving their sentences.

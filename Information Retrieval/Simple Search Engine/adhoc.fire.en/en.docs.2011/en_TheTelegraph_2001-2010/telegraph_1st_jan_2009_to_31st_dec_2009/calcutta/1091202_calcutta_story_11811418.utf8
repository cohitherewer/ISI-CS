                      Sayak 36                    Sayak celebrates its 36th anniversary with a five-day festival of its own plays. To be performed this evening is the groups latest production, Gnan Briksher Fall, based on Leo Tolstoys Fruits of Culture. Set against the background of the decadent babu-culture that prevailed at the dawn of the 20th century, it unfolds the actions that take place in the household of pseudo-liberal Brahmo zamindar Ahibhusan Bagchi. A planchet-maniac by nature, he is joined in his supernatural pursuits by the local intelligentsia including a doctor, a lawyer and a professor. His wife and children are preoccupied with their respective idle, romantic or flamboyant lives. The working-class and poor peasants of the village, on the other hand, exhibit a great optimism and zest for life. Instructed by his deceased father to do so during a planchet session, Ahibhusan promises to sell fertile land to the peasants at a very low price. The peasants work hard to save enough to buy this land, but when they finally approach Ahibhusan, he turns them away. Mrittika, the intelligent maid-servant of the zamindar family, comes to their rescue and secures for them their promised land. Yet, Mrittika has sacrficed her own values for their cause and is miserable. The play ends with the peasants consoling her that she has not sinned as her actions have saved many lives.

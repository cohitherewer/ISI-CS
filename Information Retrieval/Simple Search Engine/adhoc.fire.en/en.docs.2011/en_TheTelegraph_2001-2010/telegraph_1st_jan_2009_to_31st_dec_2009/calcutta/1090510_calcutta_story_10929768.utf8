The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mega music house

	When one listens to digitally-remastered recordings of the great musicians of the past, one realises that the past is not something that one has left behind and moved on, and that nostalgia is not the only sentiment it can inspire.         
	On the other hand, the past lingers on in the present, waiting to be rediscovered. This realisation dawns again upon one as one listens to the CDs of the magnificent Megaphone recordings of the 1930s.         
	The music company has an archive of several lakh recordings, including songs in Bengali and Hindi and regional languages such as Oriya and Assamese, and Nepali and Burmese as well. And when Salil Chowdhury plays the harmonium like the accordion, Jaddanbai (yes, Nargiss mother) sings a thumri, or Ahindra Chaudhury, Sisir Bhaduri and Chhabi Biswas mouth their lines in the paala or drama Alamgir, the gap of years that separates us from these artistes instantly dissolves, and for the few moments they perform they return to our times.        
	When one enters the close-to-200-year-old building in which Megaphone is housed on Mahatma Gandhi Road near Tamar Lane opposite College Street, one could be going back to the times when Begum Akhtar, Kanan Debi and Nazrul used to stay there during recordings.         
	It has a tiny courtyard and the surrounding verandahs are shaded with louvres, bottom upwards. The marble floors with grit ingrained in them have turned grey, and the wooden staircase is rickety but still sturdy.         
	Kamal Ghosh, 78, sits in his office in a first-floor room on whose walls are displayed Megaphone hits down the decades, and a black-and-white photograph of a mother and child.         
	Ghosh explained that the latter was taken by none else than filmmaker Bimal Roy. Such celebrities from yesteryear keep materialising from nowhere as Ghosh tells the story of Megaphone that came into being during the golden years of Calcutta in the 1930s.        
	Megaphone started operating from 1910 when it sold gramophone machines from its outlet J.N. Ghosh amp; Co at 1 Lenin Sarani and made harmoniums as well. It was also the sole distributor of gramophone motors manufactured by Thornes company of Switzerland.         
	Megaphone was started by Jitendra Nath Ghosh, Kamalbabus uncle. When the demand for discs increased it began its recording venture in 1932 and the singer was Dhiren Das, who was the father of the comedian, Anup Kumar.         
	Subsequently, some of the greatest musicians of the country began their careers here. Ustad Enayet Khan (sitar and surbahar) and his son, Vilayat Khan and Ustad Alauddin Khan were on their list of artistes. Both Bade Ghulam Ali Khan and Begum Akhtar did their first recordings here.         
	Begum Akhtar first used to stay in Ripon Street then, and thereafter she used to put up in the Megaphone office. Kanan Debi (till 1958, when Jitendra Nath died) and Bhishmadeb Chattopadhyay did all their recordings here. Gyanendra Prasad Goswami and Tarapada Chakrabarty were also regulars here, and Megaphone will soon release the latter artistes recordings on his birth centenary this year.        
	Megaphone also has a wealth of paalas  Karnarjun with Kanan Debi and Durgadas Bandopadhyay, Mir Kasim with Nirmalendu Lahiri, Soroshi with Durgadas and Prabha Debi, Ramer Sumati with Jahar Ganguli, plays starring Sarajubala, and the soundtrack of Rajlakshmi Srikanta with Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen.        
	Kamal Ghosh in his lifetime had the good fortune to meet some of our greatest musicians. He remembers Alauddin Khan as an amiable old man who would speak in a Bangal dialect. Nazrul would train singers there and he still has his handwritten notation book. The rehearsal rooms still exist in the Megaphone house but it is their archive that Megaphone is now mostly dependent on.       SOUMITRA DAS

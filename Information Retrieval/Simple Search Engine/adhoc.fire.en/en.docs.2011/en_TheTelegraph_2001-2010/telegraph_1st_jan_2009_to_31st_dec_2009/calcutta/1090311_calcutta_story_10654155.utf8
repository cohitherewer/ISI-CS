The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tooth removed from windpipe
                                                                                                               Tooth removed from windpipe
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A tooth stuck in a bronchus (windpipe) of a 55-year-old man for three years was removed by SSKM doctors on Tuesday.        
	Rajendra Prasad Gupta, a resident of Garulia in North 24-Parganas, had swallowed a molar that came loose during lunch. It got stuck in Guptas right bronchus but he was under the impression that it had passed into the intestine.        
	Gupta started suffering from respiratory distress along with cough eight months ago. A doctor advised him to get an X-ray done.         
	The report showed the tooth was stuck in the right bronchus. Local doctors failed to remove it.        
	On Sunday, Gupta was taken to the ENT department of SSKM Hospital. The tooth was extracted after an hour-long surgery, said Ranjan Paul, the head of the department. Many tissues had grown around the tooth and only a small part was visible, said Paul. The molar has three sharp roots which could have got stuck in the trachea wall while being extracted, he added. The tooth could have caused infection and damaged the right lung if it remained there any longer. He is out of danger now, said a doctor.

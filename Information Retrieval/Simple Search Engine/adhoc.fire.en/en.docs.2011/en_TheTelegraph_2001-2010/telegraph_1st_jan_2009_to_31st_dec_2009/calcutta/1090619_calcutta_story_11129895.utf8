The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | School to reopen as Trinamul backs out 
                                                                                                               School to reopen as Trinamul backs out 
          A STAFF REPORTER                           Partha Chatterjee                                  
	Vivekananda Mission School, shut down indefinitely on Wednesday, will reopen on Monday following an assurance from Trinamul Congress leader Partha Chatterjee that the party would not back the union of Group D employees.        
	Chatterjee, the leader of Opposition in the Assembly, called up principal Keya Sinha on Thursday afternoon and assured her that his party would not be involved in the union.        
	He told me that he would ask his party members to stay away... as there should not be any union in an educational institution. He also requested us to reopen the school, said Sinha.        
	The principal announced soon after the telephonic conversation that the school would reopen on Monday.        
	The Joka school, where more than 3,000 students study, was closed down indefinitely after a few Group D employees and local Trinamul leaders allegedly heckled a few teachers and did not allow the nursery section to function on Wednesday.        
	When contacted by Metro, Chatterjee said: We will not endorse such hooliganism and will not allow any union to use the Trinamul banner without the leaderships approval as the party has decided to reorganise its trade union mechanism.        
	The leader, however, added that the management should look into the causes that led to the formation of a union for the first time in the 25-year-old school.        
	The Vivekananda Mission School Non-teaching Employees Union, formed on May 25, has been demanding timely payment of salaries, confirmation of their jobs and a declaration that appointment of all non-teaching employees must be routed through them.        
	The principal has called a meeting with the guardians on Saturday to thank them for standing by the management.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Runway tech eye shut 
                                                                                                               Runway tech eye shut 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The Category II Instrument Landing System (CAT II ILS) at the city airport will not be operational from March 16 to 31 as the equipment is replaced with a new set.        
	Flights might be disrupted if the minimum visibility drops below 1,200m, said airport officials.        
	The Airports Authority of India (AAI) issued a notice to airmen on Thursday in this regard.        
	Replacement of the ILS equipment, installed in 1993, is long overdue. New, state-of-the-art equipment have been installed but to make it operational, the old set has to be discarded, said P.K. Singhal, the regional executive director (eastern region) of the AAI.        
	CAT II ILS is installed for landing and take-off on the northern side of the runway. When the system works, minimum visibility required for flight operation is 350m. During the changeover, the minimum visibility requirement will increase to 1,200m.        
	At the other end of the runway, where CAT I ILS is installed, minimum visibility required is 1,600m.        
	At this time of the year, the weather is generally good and the visibility more than 1,200m. So, we have decided to start work now, added Singhal.         
	A senior air traffic control official said a thunderstorm or heavy rainfall could stall flights during the period.        
	The new ILS equipment, imported from the US, can be upgraded to CAT III, which can guide flights when the visibility is 50 metres or more.        
	The changeover of ILS equipment was scheduled in October.         
	The process was deferred because of shortage of calibration aircraft and operation of Haj flights.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Lost in the crowd
                                                                                                               Lost in the crowd
										      Eyewitness                      Exhibition of works by students of Kala Bhavana at the Academy of Fine Arts (picture by Bishwarup Dutta). (Below)				 A dry pastel and charcoal on canvas by Bikas Karmakar                                 
	The ground floor of the Academy of Fine Arts is stuffed with art works by students of Kala Bhavana, Santiniketan, who are holding their annual exhibition in the city.         
	The Kala Bhavana principal, R. Siva Kumar, has written in the catalogue that Santiniketan was the first Indian institution to encourage students to shape oneself according to ones perception and talent. Hence its the diversity of practices that we see amply represented here.         
	Besides acting as a stimulus of innovation, this institution has from its inception attracted foreign students. Their presence definitely gives a different look to work emerging out of this institution. However, being a students exhibition, wheat and chaff are exhibited together and the variety of art work seen here is quite maddening. As in many such shows, the sheer volume of work on exhibition makes viewing all of it in one go a daunting exercise.         
	It is easy to miss out on some of the works with an undeniable spark in this morass of mediocrity. In such a situation, display suffers. In some of the sections the paintings and the sculptures were so close to each other that there was no alternative for viewers but to get up close and personal with them.        
	There were quite a few examples of textiles, appliqu and tapestry, media that are not seen in most gallery shows although they are being exhibited with increasing frequency.         
	Watercolours were also there, and for students, the quality was of a high order, although one has to admit that students trained in this medium in Calcutta excel themselves. The print section was excellent, with some large woodcuts and smaller lithographs and well-executed etchings. This was perhaps the best section with the students showing a good deal of maturity in execution. Some of the larger canvases caught the eye. Bikas Karmakar created a complicated tangle of lines that looked fantastical but was actually a depiction of familiar street scene. Su Mi Nahs charcoal drawings and scribbles spoke volumes for his restraint. Arnab Basus tiny sculpture was marked by an economy of lines.       SOUMITRA DAS

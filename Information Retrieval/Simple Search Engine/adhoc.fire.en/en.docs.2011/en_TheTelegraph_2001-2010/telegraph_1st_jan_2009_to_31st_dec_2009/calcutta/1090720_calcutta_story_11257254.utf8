The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Action not-taken report
                                                                                                               Action not-taken report
                                          
	On July 18, 2008, Calcutta High Court had passed a comprehensive order to combat vehicular pollution in the city with a series of clearly defined deadlines and directives. The judicial verdict was not a suo motu one, it converted a state environment department notification  submitted by the state pollution control board during the hearing  into a court order, passed in response to a public interest litigation filed by environmentalist Subhash Dutta.        
	One year later, almost to the day, no deadline has been met and every directive has been reduced to a farce. Calcutta continues to be choked by the emission from lakhs of polluting and old vehicles with the government and the Opposition for once united in the assault on our lungs.        
	Among many other deadlines ducked, the government has managed to submit only two action taken reports to the court in the past 12 months, when it was supposed to submit one every fortnight.        
	With the July 31 deadline looming  along with imminent confusion and chaos  prepares an (in)action taken report summing up the complete lack of will to clean Calcuttas air.        
	AGE BAR        
	What the court had directed        
	Transport vehicles 15 years old and above to be phased out and not allowed to operate within the Calcutta Metropolitan Area beyond March 31, 2009 (extended till July 31, 2009 following a government plea for time).        
	The ban covered taxi, buses, minibuses, trucks and other goods vehicles; both stage carriage and contract carriage vehicles.        
	What the government has done        
	Nothing. Not a single vehicle has been replaced according to the court order. Out of the three transport categories totalling 86,209 taxis, buses and goods vehicles attracting the ban, according to government records, there was some movement on the taxi front but that too has hit a roadblock.         
	Talks with bus owners have gone nowhere and discussions with goods vehicles owners are awaited.              
	AUTORICKSHAWS              
	What the court had directed        
	Registration of 2-stroke auto rickshaws to be stopped immediately and such autos should be phased out completely by December 31, 2008; the police were entrusted with the task to carry out the order. Plus, all registered autos plying within Calcutta Municipal Area to be 4-stroke single-mode LPG/ CNG by March 31, 2009 (extended till July 31, 2009 following a government plea for time).        
	Also, all unauthorised autos to be seized by the police. Selling of adulterated fuel or katatel to be stopped.        
	What the government has done        
	Made a quarter-hearted effort to implement the December 31, 2-stroke ban order from January 1, 2009 but abandoned it as soon as auto drivers supported by unions of all political hues turned aggressive.        
	From then on, hardly 2,500 2-stroke autos have been replaced by 4-stroke single mode LPG vehicles  out of nearly 40,000 registered autos  though the government had promised in court that 2,500-3,000 autos would be converted every month from January. Now, the government is working on an eight-year window for 2-stroke autos  allowing autos manufactured after August 1, 2000 to ply with LPG conversion  but no official notification has been issued.        
	Plus, hardly 100 illegal autos  out of around 40,000 on roads  have been seized according to a submission in court in January (the police authorities refused to provide updated figures).        
	As for adulterated fuel, a few thousand litres have been confiscated, an illegal manufacturing unit has been closed down by the environment department, but katatel counters continue to flourish, especially on the citys fringes.              
	LPG stations              
	What the court had directed        
	Oil companies should arrange for adequate LPG fuelling centres so that clean vehicles do not face problems.        
	What the government has done         
	At meetings with oil companies held last August, the government was told that the existing 12 LPG outlets in the city were 80 per cent underutilised, but they could still come up with another 10 outlets by March. But only three more outlets are set to be added and the converted autos are complaining of refuelling time-and-distance problems.              
	PUC CENTRES              
	What the court had directed        
	Pollution Under Control (PUC) certificate centres should be regularly checked by the pollution control board and the motor vehicles department; licences of centres found to be issuing fake certificates to be cancelled for at least two years and a pollution cost of at least Rs 25,000 to be imposed.        
	What the government has done        
	Initially some checks were run but that was it. According to the last report submitted to the court, only 12 PUC centres have been checked; six  that is 50 per cent  were found to be operating unsatisfactorily but no action was taken against any of them.              
	MONITORING panel              
	What the court had directed        
	Government had been asked to set up a monitoring committee which was to commence functioning forthwith and submit reports periodically.         
	What the government has done        
	The monitoring panel was formed promptly but only two meetings were held last year. This year, two meetings were convened and then cancelled.              
	LAST WORD        
	The July 31 deadline will be flouted on every count by the government. What happens next? wonders Subhash Dutta.

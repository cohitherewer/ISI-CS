                      Polo passion                    The Calcutta Polo Club, established in 1862 by two British soldiers, Captain Robert Stewart and Major General Joe Shearer, was where the modern game of polo was formalised. Organised polo matches in the city were revived in 2006 by Keshav Bangur after a gap of almost 10 years when the sport languished for want of corporate support. Around 30 leading players, mostly from Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabad, along with 30-odd outstation horses will add sheen to The BFL Corporation Polo Season 2009, presented by The Telegraph and held in association with the Fort William Riding amp; Polo Club. Local challenge in the competition will be offered by the Calcutta Polo Club and the Fort William Riding amp; Polo Club. The season gallops to a start today with The Telegraph Carmichael Cup at the Pat Williamson Ground on the racecourse, its final slated for December 20. Also to be held on the same day is the final of The White amp; Mackay Double Lion Cup. The final of The Floatel Ezra Cup, the oldest tournament in the world, will be played on December 23, along with the Kingfisher Airlines Cup final. The curtain comes down on the season with the BFL Corp Polo Masters on Christmas Day, which also features an exhibition match involving the Manipur team.

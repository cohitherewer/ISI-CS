The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Land for pumping station 
                                                                                                               Land for pumping station 
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                              
	The civic body has finally got land to set up a drainage pumping station at Jagannath Ghat, which is expected to spare over 1 lakh residents of Chitpur, Garanhata, Posta, Burrabazar and Ram Mandir areas the pain of regular waterlogging.         
	Last week, Calcutta Port Trust decided to lease out a 2.5-cottah plot to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation for the project. The port trust will lease out the plot for 15 years.        
	The pumping station is expected to be completed by February 2012 and serve the area bordered by Chittaranjan Avenue, MG Road, Vivekananda Road and the Hooghly. The area has faced waterlogging since the construction of the Metro Railway tunnel under Chittaranjan Avenue.         
	Former municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay, who is now the municipal affairs secretary, had been trying for two years to lease the plot from the port trust. According to him, around Rs 7 crore is required to set up a 30-cusec stormwater drainage pumping station.         
	My successor, Arnab Roy, will have to decide whether the pumping station will be built on a turnkey basis. He will also decide the builder, Bandyopadhyay said.         
	Last month, the civic body commissioned a drainage pumping station at Marcus Square to tackle waterlogging on MM Burman Street, Muktaram Babu Street and Thanthania areas.        
	The proposed pumping station at Jagannath Ghat would be double the capacity of the Marcus Square facility.        
	The Metro tunnel cut off the drainage facilities of the eastern part of Chittaranjan Avenue, said civic chief engineer (drainage amp; sewerage) Amit Kumar Roy.        
	The proposed pumping station will drain run-off rainwater into the Hooghly. Run-off rainwater does not need to be treated before being discharged into the river, he added.

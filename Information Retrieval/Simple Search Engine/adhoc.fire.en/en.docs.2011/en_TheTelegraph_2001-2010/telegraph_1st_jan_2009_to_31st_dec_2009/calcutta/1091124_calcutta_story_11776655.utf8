          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Four youths bashed up a sub-inspector in full public view on Sunday night after he protested against the violation of a traffic rule by them.        
	The quartet fled after Faiyaz Ahmed, of the detective departments anti-dacoity wing, collapsed on a crowded Rabindra Sarani in central Calcutta.        
	The incident occurred around 9.30pm when Ahmed was driving home with his wife after dinner at a restaurant.        
	He was driving from south to north as is norm on Rabindra Sarani. While he was turning right at the Poddar Court crossing, a car from north blocked his way, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police, headquarters.        
	Faiyaz got off his car and asked the driver of the other car why he violated the one-way norm.        
	It was reason enough for the four occupants of the car to become furious. All of them came out and dared Faiyaz to take on them. Without revealing his identity, Faiyaz tried to reason with them that it was the duty of every responsible citizen to follow traffic rules, said an officer of Bowbazar police station.        
	The youths then pounced on him and assaulted him with kicks and blows.        
	The attackers did not stop even after the sub-inspector slumped to the ground. They left when the officer could resist them no longer, the officer added.        
	Faiyazs wife took him to Bowbazar police station where an FIR was lodged.         
	He was later taken to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital from where he was released after treatment, said Shamim.        
	The police said a search had been launched for the four.        
	The officer could manage to take down the registration number of the car. We have got the address of the cars owner from the records with the public vehicles department. The four attackers have been identified but they are on the run, said another officer of Bowbazar police station.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Figure fib in foul air fight
                                                                                                               Figure fib in foul air fight
          OUR BUREAU                          CHECK YOUR FACTS: Subhas Chakraborty                                  
	Two-stroke autos converted to four-stroke: 1,066        
	Two-stroke autos converted to four-stroke: 4,336        
	Applications received for conversion: 2,456        
	Applications received for conversion: 19,500              
	The two sets of figures have come from the same source  the government of West Bengal.         
	And they were announced within a space of just one week  in the high court on March 17 and in the Assembly on Monday.        
	Responding to a question from Manas Bhunia of the Congress on what the state had done to curb vehicular pollution, transport minister Subhas Chakraborty said: Of the 45,000 autos (30,000 registered) in Calcutta and the two 24-Parganas, 4,336 have been converted to four-stroke. More than 19,500 applications have been received for conversion. Moreover, the contribution of vehicular pollution to the citys overall pollution has reduced from 48 to 35 per cent. Therefore, it would be wrong to say that there isnt any progress.        
	Punching holes in the ministers statistics, environment activist Subhash Dutta said: Exactly a week ago, an affidavit filed in the high court by the state government had stated that 1,066 autos had been converted to four-stroke since July last year. How could the number jump four times in just seven days?        
	Sources in Bajaj Auto, which is overseeing the conversion in the city and the two districts, said the figure had not crossed the 1,200 mark till Monday.        
	The affidavit also contradicts the ministers statement on the number of applications received for conversion. The state had informed the court that only 2,456 pleas had come, almost nine times less than what the minister claimed in the Assembly, Dutta added.        
	Auto-emission expert S.M. Ghosh laughed away Chakrabortys claim that the extent of vehicular pollution in the city had come down.        
	There is no system to calibrate vehicular pollution. I wonder how he had arrived at the original figure of 48 per cent and how he has conjured up the present figure of 35. There is no scientific basis to his claim, said Ghosh.        
	He, however, added that thanks to meteorological factors, the level of vehicular pollution tends to come down with the onset of summer.        
	Bhunia later termed the ministers reply to his question an eyewash.        
	Even with fudged figures, he failed to conceal the lack of initiative on the governments part to try and implement the court order on polluting vehicles, he said.        
	The high court has given the government till July 31 to clean up its act after it blamed the latest go-slow on the elections.

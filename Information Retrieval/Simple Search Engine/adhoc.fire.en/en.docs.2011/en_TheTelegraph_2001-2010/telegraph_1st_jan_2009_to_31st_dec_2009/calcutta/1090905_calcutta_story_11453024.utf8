The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Escape route for road-hog pandals
                                                                                                               Escape route for road-hog pandals
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	Road-hog pandals in town got the leeway they were looking for after the court crackdown with the fire brigade bending rules to allow a Kasba puja to leave just four feet of road space instead of the stipulated six feet.        
	On Friday, Calcutta High Court approved the fire services departments recommendation in the case involving Kasba RK Chatterjee Road Adhibasi Brinda, which had been asked to demolish the illegal portion of a pandal that was obstructing a thoroughfare.        
	Justice S. Banerjee said the puja committee could use up to 16 feet of the lane, provided four feet of space was left uniformly from the ground to sky so that light and air can smoothly pass through the windows of the house owned by the petitioner (lawyer Ishita Chakrabarti).        
	The judge asked both the petitioner and the police to inspect the site again and report back to the court on whether the puja committee had left four feet of space. Come and tell me about it on September 7, Justice Banerjee said.        
	The verdict would have made the Kasba organisers happy but the fire services departments decision  and the courts endorsement  left those campaigning against road-hog pujas worried.        
	The decision to allow the Kasba puja to leave just four feet of space on the road has certainly set a precedent. The same argument will now be used in cases involving other pandals erected in violation of the rules, warned advocate Rabishankar Chatterjee.        
	The director-general of West Bengal Fire Services granted the two-foot relaxation after receiving a formal application from the puja committee, which had originally constructed a pandal leaving barely enough room for a pedestrian to slip through.        
	L.N. Meena, the superintendent of police of South 24-Parganas, said his department would go by the court order and execute it.        
	We dont know whether this (the departure from pandal norms) has created a precedent or not. What we do know is that the courts order is sacrosanct. We only hope nobody will do anything unpleasant to mar the festive spirit, he added.        
	A senior fire services official said lack of road space across the city had forced his department to compromise.         
	 We might have compromised two feet but we have imposed several conditions on them (the Kasba puja), including making the pandal fire-proof. We might have to do the same with other pujas given the space crunch, he explained.        
	Metro went around the city on Friday and spotted several road-hog pujas for which the verdict could be a lifeline.        
	The pandal erected by 47 Palli Sarbojanin Durgotsab  off Mukul Bose Road in Ramgarh, near Garia  blocks an entire lane. The gate of the house adjacent to the pandal is being temporarily kept open so that pedestrians can get to the other side.         
	We have obtained permission from the police and are awaiting the civic body, fire brigade and CESCs approval, said Ajoy Bhattacharya, an organiser.        
	The Dum Dum Park Bharat Chakra puja is another one that blocks an entire road. There is a second puja in the vicinity, organised by Tarun Sangha. The lanes surrounding Tarun Sangha remain packed with cars during the four days. Residents of Dum Dum Park cant reach Jessore Road quickly even during an emergency, said a resident.

                                                                                                               Drug racket busted, 3 held
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Sleuths of the narcotic control bureau (NCB) claimed to have busted an international drug racket being run from Burrabazar and arrested three persons on Tuesday night.        
	The NCB officials also raided a farmhouse in Bongaon, where a laboratory had allegedly been set up to refine crude heroin brought from western India. Heroin and chemicals worth over Rs 3 crore were seized.        
	We arrested Abhijit Mondal, Abdul Majid Mullick and kingpin Bimal Mondals father Santosh. We seized 3.8kg heroin and 44kg acetic anhydride, a controlled chemical used to process crude heroin, said K. Shanker, the zonal director of NCB.         
	The heroin seized on Tuesday is also known as power heroin as it is stronger than the original drug.        
	Sleuths said they received information in January that narcotics from Rajasthan and Madhya Paradesh were being sent to Bangladesh through the porous border at Bongaon.         
	We raided two places in Bongaon and came to know about the carriers and place of delivery. During a third raid about a month back, we unearthed the money trail. Money for buying the drug was sent from Burrabazar through the hawala channel and the delivery was controlled by some persons in Burrabazar through Bimal in Bongaon, said an NCB official.         
	On Tuesday night, NCB sleuths in plainclothes stood waiting at Chandpara railway station, one stop before the Bongaon junction in North 24-Parganas. Abhijit and Abdul came to the station with two cans containing acetic anhydride and we nabbed them. After interrogating them, we raided the farmhouse at Dingamanik, which belongs to Bimal, said an NCB official.         
	The officials said more raids would follow.

                      Surviving terrorism                    Art is certainly the best medium to spread the message of peace, and what better way to do it than through a choreographic presentation that, besides fulfilling its main objective, also delights and captivates the hearts of the audience. As its name suggests, Phoenix  Rising from the Ashes is an inspirational journey through dance, tracing the psychological transition from death and despair to life and hope as ordinary citizens attempt to come to terms with acts of terrorism. Based on recent terrorist attacks in the country and condemning all calamity caused by human hatred and malice, it voices the emotions of common people who become its innocent, unsuspecting victims. Aesthetically woven in Kathak style, with its characteristic pirouettes, footwork and swift movements, it is a visually attractive, expressive as well as a thought-provoking performance. Concept and choreography: Sayanee Chavda. Music: Sunando Mukherjee, Naresh Mukherjee and Sayanee Chavda.                    Event: A Kathak presentation by Sayanee Chavda and group When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: G.D. Birla Sabhagar

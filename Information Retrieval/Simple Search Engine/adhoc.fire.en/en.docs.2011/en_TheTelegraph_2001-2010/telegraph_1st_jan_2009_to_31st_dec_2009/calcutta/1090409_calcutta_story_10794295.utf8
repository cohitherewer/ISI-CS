          A STAFF REPORTER                          Bithi Roy, the Class IX student of Kona                                  
	A 15-year-old Howrah schoolgirl who did not return home after going out with friends on Tuesday afternoon was found raped and murdered beside a rail track on Wednesday morning.        
	The post-mortem revealed sexual assault by more than one person and multiple injuries, including strangulation marks on the neck. Some of the injuries were inflicted with a sharp weapon, said a doctor who assisted in the autopsy.        
	Police said they found a mans sandal near the body of Bithi Roy, a student of Class IX at Aryabani Girls High School in Kona. Her slippers were lying at least 30 metres away.        
	Father Sambhu, a factory worker, found a threatening text message in Bengali from a male acquaintance on her cellphone while looking for her friends numbers. Bithi had left the cellphone at home on Tuesday.         
	Tumi atotai baaje hoye gechho je tumi karor kachh theke bhalobasha pabena.Madhur jonyo aami jaan diye ditey pari abar jaan niteo pari. Tai tomake last barer moto warning dichhi amader bhalobashar majhe ashbe na. (You have become so bad that you will never get anyones love. I can give my life for Madhu and also take a life for her, which is why I am warning you again not to come between us), said the message, sent on April 3.        
	Officers at Liluah police station declined to disclose the identity of the person who sent the message, but sources said he was the boyfriend of a girl who was part of Bithis circle of friends. The police also wouldnt confirm whether the sender of the message had been interrogated.        
	Bithis mother Shanti said her daughter had left their home at Kona Chowdhurypara with classmate Priyanka Mandal, 16, around 5pm on Tuesday. The two cycled to their common friend Srabanti Naskars house near Kona Bazaar, where a fourth girl  Madhumita Naskar  joined them a little later.         
	According to Priyanka, the four of them then decided to take a stroll by a nearby lake. Its something that we often do. We walk for a while and then sit by the lake to chat, she said.        
	Priyanka told the police that they left for their respective homes after sundown and she had no clue Bithi was missing until some residents woke her and the rest of the family up in the dead of night to ask about her friend.        
	My husband returned from work around 9pm and was shocked to learn that Bithi wasnt home. We waited two more hours before heading for Priyankas house, Shanti said.        
	A missing diary was lodged with Liluah police station around 2am.        
	Sambhu received a call from Priyankas home around 6 in the morning, saying a body had been found near the rail track close to their house. He took one look at the girl  in an orange-coloured long skirt and a blood-stained, off-white top  and let out a cry of anguish.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | The City Diary
                                                                                                               The City Diary
                Bharat Mahato, a contract labourer at a Bally jute mill, was arrested on Thursday on the charge of murdering wife Rina. The 32-year-old hit her on the head with a sword and slit her throat in front of their four daughters at their Howrah home. Police said Mahato had killed his wife on the spur of the moment. A sword and two knives were found near the body.																																																								  Missing teenager: Police are still clueless about 15-year-old Rishensi Neha Horo, a Class X student of St Pauls Boarding Day on Diamond Harbour Road, who went missing two months back. A few days ago, a local youth had told the cops that Rishensi was seen boarding a bus in Thakurpukur. The police had alerted all nearby police stations.																																																								  quot;We have asked her friends if she was having an affair, said an officer. But the family alleged that she had been kidnapped though they had not received any ransom call. A probe is on to find out if she had disappeared on her own or been kidnapped by someone who wanted to settle a score with her parents, said an investigating officer.  Airport threat: Security at Calcutta airport was tightened on Thursday after the authorities received a letter on Wednesday afternoon, which warned of a blast on an Air India flight between October 7 and 12. All agencies have been asked to take extra security measures.   Correction: V.G. Jog appeared as Viji Jog in a Metro report (Tabla whiz who woos Arnie to Zeta-Jones) on Thursday. The error is regretted.

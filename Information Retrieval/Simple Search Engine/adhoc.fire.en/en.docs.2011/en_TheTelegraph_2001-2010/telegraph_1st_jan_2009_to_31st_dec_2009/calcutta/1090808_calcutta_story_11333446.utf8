The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Twang-twang on guitar without Twitter
                                                                                                               Twang-twang on guitar without Twitter
  - Netizens share pain of hacker attack that paralysed social networking sites           MALINI BANERJEE                                                The Twitter page of actress Priyanka Chopra		      
	 whentwitterwasdown I didnt have anything better to do but to keep refreshing the page. Without Twitter its so BORING!         
	 Rolled up in fetal position and rocked back and forth whentwitterwasdown        
	 whentwitterwasdown Facebook was down too. My life was almost over              
	Despondency swept through the Twitter and Facebook-fixated world on Thursday when both services  along with search lifeline Google  didnt function or were infuriatingly slow for hours after a hacker attack.         
	The official Twitter blog called the DoS despair  thats short for denial of service the result of a single, massively coordinated attack. The problem may have been combated by Thursday night but the worlds  and Calcuttas  fleet-fingered Netizens needed a whole lot of comforting throughout Friday.         
	Twitter was flooded with messages detailing user despair. A city-based Twitterer, Poptate, wrote: whentwitterwasdown i went twang twang twang on my guitar.        
	With Facebook being down at the same time, it seemed to be the end of the world for some. Most of the Internet is screwed up... Kabhi Twitter is giving 404s (the standard file or page not found error message).. to kabhi Linkedin.. to kabhi Facebook, tweeted Mitesh Ashar.        
	So what did Calcutta do when they couldnt tweet?         
	Some ended up working harder than they normally would. I am generally on Twitter all day, so it was quite irritating, fumed designer Kallol Datta. I ended up smoking more, and then finally gave up and got some work done. I kept getting texts from other friends saying that Twitter was down.         
	Shane Ireland, 35, missed more than one Web appointment.         
	 A couple of friends of mine have this daily session of Facebook poker that I had to miss. I was trying to tag people and I couldnt do it. Plus a friend from Canada is online at a specific time, and we couldnt chat, bemoaned Ireland, who is on Facebook from 8am to 1am on a regular day.         
	Not everyone noticed the crash, of course. I was busy shooting for a reality show. My iPhone had gone for repairs, so I wasnt checking the Web there either, said percussionist Bickram Ghosh.         
	Fellow Facebook regular, actress Parno Mittra, also missed the cyber mayhem. When was it? Oh! I was working then, she shrugged.        
	It took the crash for one Twitterer to realise that there was more to life than networking on the Net. whentwitterwasdown i realised i had a life. seriously, get over it.

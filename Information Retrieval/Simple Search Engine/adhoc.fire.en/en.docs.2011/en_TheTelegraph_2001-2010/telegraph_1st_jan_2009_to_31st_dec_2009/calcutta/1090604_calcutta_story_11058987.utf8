The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Storm hits Tagore bust
                                                                                                               Storm hits Tagore bust

	The Oriental Seminary in north Calcutta suffered much more than uprooted trees and damaged walls when cyclone Aila brushed past the city on May 25. It lost a statue of its former student Rabindranath Tagore. The 180-year-old school on Rabindra Sarani says it does not have the funds to replace the broken bust.         
	A 40-year-old krishnachura tree fell on the statue. The pedestal broke under the impact and the bust fell to the ground. An hour later, a jackfruit tree was also uprooted, said Tapas Roy, the teacher-in charge. The defaced statue has been kept in the school library, he added.         
	The krishnachura trunk also hit the eastern wall of the school, damaging it severely.         
	We were extremely sad to see Tagore lying on the ground. We informed the civic authorities. The next day, it took 10 people to extricate the bust from the wreckage, said english teacher C.P. Ghosal, who has been with the school for the past 25 years.         
	This statue was installed in 1993. Built in the Russian style, the bust was sculptured by a faculty from Rabindra Bharati University. It was sponsored by a businessman named L.N. Daga and was a replacement for a plaster-of-paris Tagore statue built in 1979.         
	Rabindranath writes in Jibonsmriti that he had been enrolled in Oriental Seminary. However, he was not very pleased with the strict discipline and punishment meted out to students, said Ghosal.         
	The main concern for the school now is replacement of the statue. We want to make a statue of stone, but dont have the funds. Ours is a state- aided institution and we charge just Rs 150 annually from each student, which is used for expenses like electricity bills said Ghosal. We can replace the statue only of we get a sponsorship or donations, or if ex-students come forward, he added.

                                                                                                               Cemetery records to be digitised
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The burial records at Bhowanipore Cemetery are being digitised to help descendants across the world trace their ancestors on the Internet.         
	A city-based IT firm, Computax Consultants, has been engaged for the job by the British Association for Cemeteries in South Asia (BACSA), which looks after the maintenance of cemeteries in the region. According to BACSA estimates, over 2 million Europeans have been laid to rest on Indian soil.         
	The firm is also digitising the records of over 100,000 burials and 20,000 graves in five other public cemeteries  Lower Circular Road, Russa Road South, Tollygunge, St Stephens Sailors Cemetery in Kidderpore, South Park Street and North Park Street.         
	The digitised records of the five cemeteries are updated every week on the website, www.burialsininidia.net, said Arijit Mitra, the proprietor of Computax Consultants.         
	We started working on the Bhowanipore cemetery in mid-March and hope to complete the work in two months, said Mitra. BACSA has paid Rs 96,000 for the job.        
	British deputy high commissioner Simon Wilson, who was present at a press meet on Friday to announce the BSCSA Computax initiative, said the list would help a lot of people trace their ancestral roots and may bring the city sizeable cemetery tourism.

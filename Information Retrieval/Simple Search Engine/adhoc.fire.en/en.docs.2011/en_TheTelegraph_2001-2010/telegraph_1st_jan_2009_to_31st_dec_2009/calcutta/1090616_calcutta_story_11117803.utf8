The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Flu facility, stillborn or sordid 
                                                                                                               Flu facility, stillborn or sordid 
										      SANJAY MANDAL      
	The only hope for flu suspects to escape the horrors of the Infectious Diseases Hospital in Beleghata lies in an airport medical facility now in no-mans land.        
	A proposal by the Airport Health Organisation of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport to build a hospital with quarantine facilities along the lines of the Delhi unit is now nobodys baby and the state government has not lifted a finger to improve conditions at the dirty and mosquito-infested ID Hospital.        
	That nothing will improve in the Beleghata quarantine ward despite the flu menace was spelt out by the state health department on Monday.        
	There are no plans to upgrade facilities at the Beleghata ID Hospital, Aniruddha Kar, the director of health services, told Metro, when asked why the city does not have better quarantine facilities for flu suspects.        
	The only hope then lies in a Delhi-like Airport Health Organisation facility. But that is not likely to happen in a hurry. We have submitted a proposal to the Union health ministry for a three-storeyed hospital with an isolation unit on the top floor, an official of the Airport Health Organisation in Calcutta said on Monday. It will have facilities abiding by World Health Organisation norms.        
	He said once set up, any passenger who needs to be quarantined would not have to face the ordeal of being admitted to the Beleghata hospital.        
	Once set up is the operative part. Officials said the Airports Authority of India (AAI) had allocated a plot of 1,120 square metre but not specified the location. We cant start work on the project because the land has not been shown to us, said an Airport Health Organisation official.         
	The AAI denied the charges. The land has been earmarked near VIP Road. But the Airport Health Organisation wants more land to set up residential quarters for doctors, nursing staff and technical staff, said a senior official of Calcutta airport. It is not possible to allocate any more land as we are facing a space crunch for the modernisation project, he added.        
	Delhi seemed aware of the stalemate over the city facility. The AAI has allocated a plot but is yet to specify the location. We have asked the Airport Health Organisation in Calcutta to first get the land earmarked and then submit a plan for the project to be taken up, an official of the director-general of health services office in the Union health ministry told Metro from Delhi.        
	In Delhi, the state-of-the-art facilities in the building housing the quarantine facility  constructed by Delhi International Airport Limited for Rs 6 crore in 12 months  is geared as much towards passenger comfort as it is to prevent the spread of infections. The Beleghata hospital is geared as much to passenger distress as it is to the spread of infections.        
	The Airport Health Organisation has also proposed a swab testing facility for the H1N1 virus in the city, so that passengers can be spared the two-day wait of test results coming from Delhi. The test takes around two hours. Why can it not be done at NICED (National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases, on the ID Hospital premises), asked the official.

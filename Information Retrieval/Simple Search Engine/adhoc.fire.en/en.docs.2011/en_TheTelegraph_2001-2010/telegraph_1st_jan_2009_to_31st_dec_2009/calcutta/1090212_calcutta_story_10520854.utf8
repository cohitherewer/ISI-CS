                                                                                                               2 more in kidney net
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two more suspected kidney racketeers have been arrested, taking the number of accused in the net to eight.        
	Police said Tanmoy Das, 22, and Subhajit Biswas, 32, were behind seven transplants in the city and three in Delhi and Chennai last year. Both will be booked under the Transplantation of Human Organs Act, said an officer investigating the case.        
	Tanmoy was picked up late on Tuesday when he turned up in Haridevpur to meet an acquaintance. Plainclothesmen laid a trap for him following a tip-off.        
	While interrogating the Kalna resident, the cops learnt about Subhajit and picked him up from Palta, in North 24-Parganas.        
	They were produced in a Sealdah court on Wednesday and remanded in police custody till February 16, said deputy commissioner (detective department) Jawed Shamim.        
	The two dealt directly with Delhi-based kingpin Manik Chowdhury and had also interacted with two other touts who have been arrested so far  Mithun Chatterjee and Hriday Kumar Dubey, said an officer.        
	A preliminary probe revealed that Tanmoy used to liaise with Chowdhury on the deals with prospective donors while Subhajit would arrange for their food, accommodation and other needs.        
	We are interrogating the duo to find out more about their roles. We are also scanning the documents handed over to us by three private hospitals in the city to find out whether they had performed any illegal transplant, the officer added.        
	The kidney racket, which has country-wide links, was unearthed on February 2, following the arrest of Mithun and Hriday.

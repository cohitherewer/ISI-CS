The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A powerless city protests
                                                                                                               A powerless city protests
  - Tumbling trees send electricity supply packing          OUR BUREAU                          Pedestrians on Gariahat Road, adept at weaving through stalls of hawkers, were on Tuesday forced to duck under a fallen tree. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                        
	Storm-swept Calcutta, denied power throughout Tuesday, took the protest to the streets, from Jodhpur Park to Jessore Road.        
	As power supply became the biggest victim of Aila, citizens demanded restoration but officials of both CESC and the state electricity board groped in the dark for solutions to the crisis.        
	Senior CESC officials said overhead wires had snapped at 1,000-odd places and nearly 200 poles were uprooted. Dilip Sen, the executive director, promised to restore normal supply by Wednesday.        
	But his team did little on Monday and Tuesday to inspire confidence among powerless Calcuttans.        
	More than 30 hours have passed but they (CESC) still dont have a clue how to repair the damage, said a resident of Jodhpur Park.        
	Southend Park, Golf Club Road, Baghajatin, parts of Tollygunge, Behala and Mahestala, Lake Town, Baguiati and Barrackpore have not had power since Monday evening.        
	There is no water in my house, and I have an ailing mother to look after. This is sheer torture, said Soubhik Chanda of Southend Park.        
	Malyaranjan Guha Thakurta, a resident of Golf Club Road, and some neighbours went to the CESC office in Jadavpur and forced officials to accompany them to the locality. The officials initially claimed to have turned off power supply around noon on Monday to avert any accident. We realised it was a lie when power was not switched on even 24 hours later. Power returned at 3.30pm, only after our visit to the CESC office, Guha Thakurta said.        
	Those who got no answer from the power authorities resorted to road blockades, causing traffic snarls on VIP Road, Jessore Road, EM Bypass and Howrah. Around 6pm, almost 400 people blocked the crossing in front of the Avishikta housing complex on the Bypass. We have been without power since noon on Monday. We have been calling the helpline but the only reply we get is Dada dekhchhi, said Joy Ghosh, a resident of the area.        
	Traffic came to a standstill at the Ruby Hospital crossing for more than two hours when around 300 people blocked the road to protest the prolonged power cut.        
	In Howrah, protesters blocked the approach road to Vidyasagar Setu near the toll plaza, GT Road near Kazipara, Drainage Canal Road and parts of the Kona Expressway.        
	Air passengers missed their flights and pilots reported late because of the blockades, airport sources said. Around 18 passengers booked on the Calcutta-Mumbai Kingfisher flight and 20 passengers scheduled to fly to Delhi with the same airline reached too late. They will be accommodated on Wednesday, said an airline official.        
	IndiGo, JetLite and other airlines also reported passengers missing evening flights because of the blockades.        
	Air Indias Calcutta-Delhi-New York flight, which was cancelled on Monday because of the cyclone, took off half an hour later than the scheduled 9pm on Tuesday because the crew arrived late. The 145 passengers had to wait an extra half an hour as the captain and co-pilot were stuck at the Ultadanga-VIP Road crossing, an airline official said.        
	The CESC machinery floundered in the face of odds. Even the helplines werent working on Monday. Officials said the storm had damaged the optical fibre cables connecting the helpline centres (1912 and 44031912) to the CESC district offices but these were repaired later. Many consumers complained that they still could not get through.        
	All our repair teams and engineers are attending to the faults. Uprooted trees prevented us from working in many areas on Monday evening, said a CESC official.         
	The impact would have been far worse if the CESC did not have a wide underground network, executive director Sen said.        
	But Salt Lake, one of the few areas where the West Bengal State Electricity Transmission Company Ltd has an underground network, went without power from a little after midnight on Monday till around 5.30am on Tuesday.        
	The power cut was caused by a sharp dip in demand in areas where overhead wires were damaged. The drop in demand led to voltage shooting up in the state grid. A substation at Jeerut, in North 24-Parganas, collapsed and supply to Salt Lake was snapped, explained A. Sarkar, the director (transmission) of the state-owned unit.

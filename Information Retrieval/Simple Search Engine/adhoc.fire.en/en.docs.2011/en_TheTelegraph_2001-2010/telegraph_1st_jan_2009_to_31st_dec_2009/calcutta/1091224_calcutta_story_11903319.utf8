                      Elusive reality        In Europe, the modernist movement in art was instrumental   in encouraging a free flow of diverse, creative ideas. Tho-  ughts about art that emerged earlier, however, still retained a   tie with new trends, though, at times, they were fiercely an  tagonistic. Waves of modernism sweeping Indian shores led   to another interesting consequence. While Indian artists   were receptive to Western influences, they also felt the need   to work their own way out of any pre-defined style and take   their art into new, uncharted territories. Modern Continuous,   the ongoing group show, narrates the stream of events that   took place in the canvases of modernists working in Calcut  ta. In their works, reality assumes an unusual dimension. The   objects featured in their art appear real, but the viewer is   filled by a feeling of disbelief at what he is seeing. As illusion   becomes the norm, the disorientation and distortion of feel  ing undermines the association we have with familiar ob  jects. Featuring works by a selection of nine artists of Bengal   all born prior to 1930, the show is one in which the past   merges with the present to paint the future with a continuous   reference. Participants: Bikash Bhattacharjee, Dharma  narayan Dasgupta, Dipak Banerjee, Ganesh Pyne, Jogen   Chowdhury, Lalu Prasad Shaw, Meera Mukherjee, Paritosh   Sen and Somnath Hore.

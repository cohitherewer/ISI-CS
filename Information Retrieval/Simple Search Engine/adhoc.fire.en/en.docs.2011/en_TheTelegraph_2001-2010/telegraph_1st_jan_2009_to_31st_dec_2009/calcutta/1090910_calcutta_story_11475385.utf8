The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Aircraft lands   with tail scrape
                                                                                                               Aircraft lands   with tail scrape
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A JetLite flight, with 135 passengers on board, flew in from Mumbai with a damaged tail but landed safely at Calcutta airport on Wednesday afternoon.        
	The Boeing 737 aircraft, which touched down at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport at 3.40pm, was grounded after a maintenance check revealed minor cracks in the tail.        
	An airline spokesperson confirmed that the aircraft had suffered what is defined as tail scrape. Sources said the cracks had developed while the plane was taking off from Mumbai.        
	The tail is a crucial component of an aircraft, controlling its direction and movement. Even a little damage to the tail can lead to serious safety hazards, said a flight engineer based in Calcutta.        
	JetLite, however, asserted that the safety of the passengers and crew was never compromised in the two-hour flight.        
	Jet Airways officials said the tail had not suffered any major damage while taking off.        
	The aircraft will undergo a service inspection... Tail scrape is not uncommon in the industry. Manufacturers have a procedure to deal with the event... an airline spokesman asserted.        
	An independent aviation expert said an aircraft could suffer tail scrape when part of the tail grazes the ground during take-off or landing because of a lack of wheel balance.        
	The flight, after landing, taxied off the runway on its own.... The damage was detected during a routine check by flight engineers, said a senior airport official.        
	Till late on Wednesday, the aircraft was undergoing repairs at Bay 49 of the Calcutta airport.        
	Air India coach fire        
	An empty passenger coach (which ferries fliers from the airport terminal to the aircraft and back) of Air India caught fire at Calcutta airport on Wednesday evening.        
	The coach was being taken for maintenance when it caught fire near the cargo bay.        
	Air India officials said the coach suffered a break jam, which led to overheating and emission of smoke and sparks.        
	The coach had carried passengers in the afternoon. It was taken off service and sent for maintenance following the detection of the snag, said an official.         
	There was fire at the rear end of the coach which was doused before the airport fire service was pressed into action, the official added.

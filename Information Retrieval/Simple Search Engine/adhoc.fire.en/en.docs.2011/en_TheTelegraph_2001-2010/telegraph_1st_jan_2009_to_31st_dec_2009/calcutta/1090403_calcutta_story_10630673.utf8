          RITH BASU                              
	A boy from the slums of Mumbai wins millions and the girl of his dreams in the recent Oscar-winning film ________        
	17 million children in India ______ as per official estimates              
	Not the typical Hangman questions, but then the game on the Child Rights and You (CRY) website is not any other online game. By filling the blanks with Slumdog Millionaire and work, respectively, the player learns about child rights as well as earns points.        
	The NGO hopes to draw people to its website with the games and motivate them to act for child rights.         
	Hangman, sudoku and crossword have been uploaded on the website as part of a campaign launched in mid-February. The programme will continue till April 12.        
	You get points for playing well. Each time your friends register and play the games on your invitation, you get an additional 10 points, CRY senior manager Poonam Chengappa told Metro from Mumbai.        
	The players can donate for the cause at http://www.playforcry.org. The minimum amount, Rs 250, is worth 500 points.        
	While 21,000 people have been referred to the site so far, 7,000 have registered and played  6,300 of them from India. Donations have crossed Rs 100,000.        
	We have tried to provide interesting information regarding child rights by way of clues and phrases in the hangman and crossword puzzles, said Chengappa.        
	In the case of Sudoku, digits are highlighted in the grids and telling statistics, such as 1 in every 40 primary schools in India is conducted in open spaces or tents and every 6th girl childs death is due to gender discrimination, are provided alongside.         
	According to Chengappa, while CRY hopes that the competitive spirit in its target group of young adults will help spread the message.         
	The NGO expects the youngsters invite more and more of their friends to the website, thus becoming and making others aware of child rights.

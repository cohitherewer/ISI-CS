The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Civic code for disaster control
                                                                                                               Civic code for disaster control
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                          Aila devastation in the city. A Telegraph picture                                  
	The citys brush with Aila has prompted the civic authorities to publish a handbook on disaster management.        
	The handbook will help in combating dislocations and disruptions better. It spells out the duties and responsibilities of civic officials when a disaster strikes so that they can immediately plunge into action without waiting for orders, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.        
	The handbook defines a disaster as a catastrophe, mishap, calamity or grave occurrence causing human suffering and which is beyond the coping capacity of the community living in the affected area. Its thrust is on tackling waterlogging.        
	Disaster Management 2009-10 lists 300 city pockets and 117 road intersections as waterlogging prone and specifies steps to be taken before and after waterlogging. Civic engineers have been identified by name and entrusted with tackling waterlogging in designated areas. More than 250 portable pumps have been acquired to boost rainwater drainage after heavy showers.        
	The conservancy department has been directed to sweep over 200 important roads twice a day (morning and afternoon) to avoid accumulation of garbage in gully pits. The list includes Dum Dum Road, Bagbazar Road, Bidhan Sarani, Kankurgachhi Road, Baithakkhana Road, Lenin Sarani and Rashbehari Avenue.         
	Besides, the handbook contains telephone numbers of senior officers of fire brigade, Calcutta Improvement Trust, Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority, city and state power utilities, public works department and other agencies.        
	Within the city proper, borough VIII in south Calcutta  spanning across Garia, Santoshpur and Jadavpur  has the largest number of low-lying pockets. In the added areas, Behala and Jadavpur have the maximum number of low-lying pockets.        
	Waterlogging is least likely on the stretch between Lenin Sarani and Lindsay Street.        
	The most vulnerable stretches in south Calcutta after a heavy shower include Ballygunge Circular Road, Lake Market, Deshapriya Park, Justice Chandra Madhab Road, Gokhale Road, Elgin Road, Ballygunge Place and Rashbehari Avenue.

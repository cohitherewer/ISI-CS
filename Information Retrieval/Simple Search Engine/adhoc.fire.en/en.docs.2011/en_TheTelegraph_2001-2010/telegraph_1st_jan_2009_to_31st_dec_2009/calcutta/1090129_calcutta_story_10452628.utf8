The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Whodunit the doctor ordered
                                                                                                               Whodunit the doctor ordered
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Alexander McCall Smith at Jadavpur University on Wednesday. Picture by Aranya Sen                                  
	Mma Precious Ramotswe, a rotund, shrewd, adorable lady, runs the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency in Gaborone, Botswana. Professor Moritz-Maria von Igelfeld is a troubled German academic. The book Portuguese Irregular Verbs is his lifes work. Isabel Dalhousie is in her forties, a philosopher and takes a great interest in people around her in Edinburgh. Pat is a young woman who works in an art gallery in Edinburgh and is part of the Bohemian life that comes with it.         
	And Alexander McCall Smith, the Scottish writer, has created the four immensely successful series featuring these four characters, one at a time, but all the time.         
	McCall Smith, the toast of the Book Fair, suffers from a condition called serial novelism, which will make him write novels till he dies, he said at a city bookstore on Wednesday. He has been writing four to five books a year since he stopped being a professor of medical law who would divide his time between Edinburgh and Botswana.         
	McCall Smith said his fiction is often accused of being utopian (his devoted readers say his books are just what the doctor ordered for the stressed soul). Then how does crime fit into his scheme of things? He writes about it a lot in Ladies Detective Agency novels, his most popular series, which has been made into a television serial by BBC and HBO.         
	Nothing alarming happens in my books, he says. Nothing happens in his books, he adds as an afterthought, with a twinkle in his eye. People who get engaged stay engaged for four-five books.        
	Isnt that wicked of him?         
	But his characters can suffer more. McCall Smith picks out the German professor von Igelfeld and says there is more humiliation in store for him, for he doesnt quite understand the world.         
	For McCall Smiths world may be benign, but it doesnt pretend that evil doesnt exist. In fact, it is everywhere, but his men and women, the tougher ones like Mma Ramotswe, know how to deal with it. Its just that Smith is not too interested in bloodshed and gore. Thats why doctors prescribe him.         
	But detective fiction, McCall Smith said, should look more at common crimes. Though when he tried to write a book about parking crime  the sleuth sees a car parked incorrectly  it became something else. It revealed a body underneath.         
	But he also knows about things working when they dont work. At the bookstore and at Jadavpur University earlier, he also spoke about The Really Terrible Orchestra, a band of useless musicians that he is a part of and started with his wife. It has become very popular, he said. He is a bassoonist, but plays other instruments with equal lack of skill. There is something fundamentally attractive about people who cant play music, he says.         
	McCall Smith delivers the Ashoke Kumar Sarkar Memorial Lecture on Thursday.

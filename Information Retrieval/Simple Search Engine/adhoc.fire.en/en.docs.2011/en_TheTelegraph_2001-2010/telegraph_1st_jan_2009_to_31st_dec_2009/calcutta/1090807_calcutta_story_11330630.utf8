                Six armed men robbed six cellphones, jewellery and Rs 2,000 from six women travelling in a ladies compartment of a Sealdah-Gede local on Thursday morning. The men boarded the train at Sealdah despite protests by the women and jumped off at Bidhannagar Road (Ultadanga) station.    Isha Mukherjee, a Baranagar resident who returned to the city from London on an Air India flight on August 4, has filed a complaint with police alleging Euro 1,000 and valuables were stolen from her luggage. The airline is looking into the matter, said an official.    Five-year-old Emon Roy, who lost his parents after the bike they were on was hit by a truck at Bally on Wednesday, was declared out of danger by doctors at Rabindranath Tagore hospital on the Bypass on Thursday.

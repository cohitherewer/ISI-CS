The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Library falls to election army
                                                                                                               Library falls to election army
				       A STAFF REPORTER                              
	At the opening of the National Library in 1953, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, then education minister, said that a citadel of power had been transformed into an abode of learning.        
	Fifty-six years on, that abode of learning has fallen prey to a citadel of power yet again with the invasion of the National Library by the Election Commission being made official on Monday.        
	Yes, the decision (to use the library for poll purposes) has been taken and we are working towards a successful implementation, chief electoral officer Debashis Sen told Metro.        
	This admission came after days of contradictory words and actions  Sen claiming that no decision had been taken about the library being used for the elections but his men going about business as usual on the premises, dumping bamboo poles and converting the old reading room into a ballot battle room.        
	Till late on Monday, however, the library had not received anything official from the Election Commissions office.        
	They had sent us a requisition initially but after the meeting between library officials and commission officials on April 24 they had told us they would let us know their final decision. We have not got any written intimation from the commission, said K.K. Banerjee, the director of National Library.        
	There are some in-house matters that need to be resolved before an official letter can be sent to the library, explained Sen, when asked why the National Library officials had been kept in the dark about the invasion.        
	The only official paper doing the rounds of the National Library on Monday  even as bamboo poles were being drilled into the greens and pandals erected  was a circular of dos and donts (see box) issued about the use of the premises by the district election officer from April 28 to May 17.        
	It is not yet official and already we are being inconvenienced by the poll work; next week will be really bad, said Abhijit De, a reader leaving Bhasha Bhavan on Monday.        
	When Chakravarthi Rajagopalachari, the first Indian governor of Bengal, had suggested that the Belvedere in Alipore would be the ideal venue for the National Library, Jawaharlal Nehru, independent Indias first Prime Minister, had written: We want to convert it into a fine Central Library where large number of research students can work and where there will be all the amenities which a modern library gives.        
	For the next few days at National Library, more poll officials than research students will be at work as the library amenities are muscled out by poll paraphernalia.

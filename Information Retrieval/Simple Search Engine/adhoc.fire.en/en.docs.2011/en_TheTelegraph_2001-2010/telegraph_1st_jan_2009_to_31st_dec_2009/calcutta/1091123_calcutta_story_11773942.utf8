                      Kaleidoscopic vision                    Triggered by an instinctive love for art and life, amateur photographer Kimsuk Ray captures images that reveal the diverse moods and rhythms of life with an almost uncanny casualness. His photographs offer a momentary, yet deeply meaningful glimpse into lifes invisible, hidden truths, that are cleverly brought to the fore by his imaginative artistry. At the ongoing second solo show, he carries his viewers to a realm of unending fantasy. Viewing his photographs is a fascinating journey through his lens into several familiar and unfamiliar territories, where the ordinary and the commonplace have been transformed into the mysterious and the unknown. Conversely, however, the distant and the obscure are also rendered intimate. He explores themes as disparate as religion, identity, power and innocence, deriving all the inputs for his creativity strewn abundantly in the world around him. Effortlessly blending aestheticism with satire in his works, Rays range and variety of interests are a reflection of his passion for life.

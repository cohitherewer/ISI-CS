          ONTHESPOT - BEHALA INDUSTRIAL ESTATE                        The Behala Industrial Estate. Pictures by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya				                                 
	The Behala Industrial Estate, located near Behala Chowrasta, was built in the late Seventies. It initially comprised only pharmaceutical units. In 1982, the estate was opened to other businesses as drug manufacturers left the place.         
	At present, nearly 110 units with varied business interests operate from the estate. These include air-conditioner manufacturers, engineering firms making pollution control equipment and metal cutting machines and paint manufacturers.         
	The units at the Behala Industrial Estate have to abide by stiff regulations to procure fire safety certificate that is mandatory for renewing their trade licence.        
	Earlier we could renew our trade licence easily. But now we have to produce fire clearance certificate in order to renew our trade licence. We applied for the fire clearance certificate with the necessary documents four months back but till date we have not received the clearance, said Sukhendu Bikash Ghose, the president of Behala Industrial Estate Entrepreneurs Association.         
	While the manufacturers complain that their business is getting affected by the delay, the fire department is enforcing stringent rules before it issues certificates.                  A closed police camp inside the Behala Industrial Estate      
	Without the trade licence, we cant take part in any tender. We are losing many business opportunities, said Pinaki Rakshit, who owns an industrial fan-manufacturing unit in the estate. Frustrated with the delay, the traders alleged the fire service officials are demanding bribes to expedite the process.         
	We had a meeting with the director of fire services four months back and lodged a complaint. He promised action but we dont see any change, said Prasanta Kumar Debnath, the assistant secretary of the association.         
	The director of the state fire and emergency services, Gopal Bhattacharya, denied the allegations against his officials. The question of asking for bribes doesnt arise since the officers from the fire department visit the spot after all other formalities are completed. Most of the traders havent yet submitted their factory plan, said Bhattacharya.         
	After they submit the factory plan, we recommend fire safety measures. The traders have to adopt those measures and inform us. After that our inspectors visit the units to see if the measures have been adopted properly. If the measures are adequate, only then will we issue fire safety clearance. In a meeting with West Bengal Small Industries Development Corporation (WBSIDC) officials held three to four months back, I informed them of the process. The WBSIDC officers asked us to take the necessary steps before issuing the clearance, he added.         
	Absence of security is another concern for the traders here. With police being withdrawn from the industrial estate during panchayat elections in May 2008, cases of theft have risen and drunkards enter the estate freely.         
	We used to have four policemen posted inside. But they did not return after they were sent on panchayat poll duty. We have spoken to the WBSIDC authorities. They forwarded our request to the South 24-Parganas police, added Debnath.         
	There was a country liquor shop just outside the boundary walls of our estate. After recent raids by the police, these people now drink inside our estate. The absence of policemen makes it easier for them. We are afraid to protest. Once officers from Behala police station came and drove them away. But we cant call them every day, said Ghose.         
	The managing director of the WBSIDC, Manoj Pant, said: I have written to the superintendent of South 24-Parganas police. But it is not an area of major concern.

                      Rhythms of life                    Art has always shared a unique relationship with nature. Though nature with its breathtaking beauty is the primary source of inspiration of all art, art appears to defy nature in its abstract, supra-realistic expressions. Rhythm of Colour is a daring exploration of this extraordinary relationship. Illustrating the experience of the modern world as perceived through the eyes of the artist, it clearly reveals the changing relationship of nature with the human race. The artists have incorporated elements of wit, fantasy and sensitivity into their vision of life and time, portraying the vagaries and dilemmas of contemporary life through astonishingly beautiful imagery. Fascinating images of people and landscapes find their way into this dynamic, refreshing and uncompromising collection. Simple landscapes depicting the pure, clean beauty of the countryside or a collision of rich colours triggering feelings of passion and desire, equally evoke the rhythms of nature and emotions. The works are raw and physical, daring to examine life from within while holding a mirror to the world and, in the process, exposing both the ills and the joys to be found. Participants include Subrata Gangopadhyay (a painting by him appears here), Suhas Roy, Prokash Karmakar, Shyamal Mukherjee, Samir Paul, Bratin Khan, Sanatan Dinda, Gourango Beshai, Sibsaday Chaudhuri and Atin Basak.                  lEvent: An exhibition of paintings by well-known artists lWhen: Till April 30; 10.30 am - 7 pm lWhere: Idiyas Gallery, 15 Dover Road

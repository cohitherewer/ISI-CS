The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Thousands stumped by math paper rules
                                                                                                               Thousands stumped by math paper rules
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Instructions in the mathematics paper on the final day of Madhyamik confused thousands of students on Friday, many of whom ended up answering more questions than they needed to.        
	A 10-mark mathematics oral examination, introduced this year and already conducted internally in the schools, was the root of the confusion.        
	The full marks in the written examination, covering topics taught in classes IX and X, for regular candidates appearing for the first time in 2009 was mentioned as 90 on top of the question paper. The full marks for all other candidates including external was 100.        
	Instructions on top of the set of questions based on the old syllabus  applicable to those who were promoted to Class IX in 2006 or earlier  mentioned the full marks as 100.        
	A student who had studied the old syllabus in Class IX and was promoted to Class X in 2007 but could not appear for Madhyamik in 2008 because of illness said he did not know whether he was to attempt 90 marks or 100.         
	Since I was appearing in Madhyamik for the first time in 2009, according to instructions on top of the question paper, I needed to attempt 90 marks. But I was not sure whether I qualified as a regular candidate. Moreover, I had studied the old syllabus in Class IX and the full marks for the paper based on the old syllabus was 100, he said.        
	Others who had studied the old syllabus in Class IX and were promoted to Class X last year but could not appear for Madhyamik because of failure to clear selection tests or other reasons faced a similar predicament.         
	Such students were supposed to attempt 90 marks but instead tried to attempt 100 marks and didnt get enough time to do so, said an official of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education.        
	According to him, about five per cent of students who are promoted to Class X cannot appear for Madhyamik in their first attempt.        
	He estimated that about 60,000 examinees in centres across the state  out of the more than 8.5 lakh appearing for Madhyamik 2009  were confused by the instructions.         
	The instructions on the question paper should have been clearer. We should have also explained who were regular candidates. Most examinees are not familiar with the rules, he added.        
	Board president Mamata Ray said she had not received any complaint from schools regarding the confusion over instructions.        
	But we will definitely look into the matter. We will place the matter in our meeting with the head examiners, she added. A section of examinees complained long answer-type problems were set in the objective section. They also claimed a trigonometry problem was not in the syllabus.

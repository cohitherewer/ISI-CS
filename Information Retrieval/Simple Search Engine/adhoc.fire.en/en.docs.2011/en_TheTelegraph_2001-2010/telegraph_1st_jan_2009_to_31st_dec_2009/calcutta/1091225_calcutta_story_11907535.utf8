The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Festive dance floor beckons   Just do the bachata, ballet or... Bollywood 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Festive dance floor beckons
   Just do the bachata, ballet or... Bollywood 
          POULOMI BANERJEE                          The slow and sensual bachata is fast catching on.   Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                                               
	Plan to burn the dance floor this festive fortnight? Be sure you know your B amp;B basics.        
	For those out of step, that means bachata and ballet, the two moves to show off this Christmas and New Years.        
	Salsa ruled the floor for a few years, but the baton has been passed. Bachata is very attractive and also easier than salsa. It has really caught on in the past year, says Aditya Upadhya of Vive La Salsa, that teaches and organises events on Latin dance forms.        
	The Latin American dance form that originated in the Dominican Republic has an affinity with salsa. When I start a batch, in the first class, I show them both salsa and bachata. When I do salsa they are like hmmm exciting. But when I do bachata they are like wow!, laughs Aditya.        
	If salsa is about energy, bachata is slower, more close, more sensual, more filmi.        
	The interest in bachata is definitely on the rise, agrees Shruti Mishra, the resident choreographer of Dance World Padatik.        
	Students are mostly young, between 18 and 28, but age is not really a barrier. I started with salsa but I now prefer bachata. It is more informal, sensual, free flowing and comes from the heart, says Ishita Bardhan, 34.        
	Adds Amit Shaha, 33: Now even at a general party, I incorporate bachata steps, whatever be the music.        
	If its not bachata, it better be ballet. When I started, I had just two dancers in the ballet batch. Today I have 15, reveals Ronnie Shambik Ghose, who with wife Mitul Ghose Sengupta, runs the dance school Rhythmosaic.        
	The first sign of a ballet boom has prompted Padatik to start a special class, with two instructors from abroad. We have some 20 students in each batch in the age group of 11 to 26 years. When we give newcomers the option to join Bollywood, hip hop or ballet, more are now opting for ballet, says Shruti of Padatik.        
	But why ballet? Dance schools attribute it to the rising number of dance competitions and shows and the growing realisation that ballet provides a good base for any other dance form by improving body flexibility and posture.        
	Then there are the parents choosing ballet for their little ones. My daughter is tall for her age and very flexible. I think ballet will improve her posture and body language and help her carry herself confidently, says Nilanjanaa, mother of four-year-old Sara Sengupta, who goes to Ronnie and Mituls ballet class. I know one reason why Malaika Arora Khan carries herself so well is because she is trained in ballet, adds the wife of actor Jisshu Sengupta.        
	Footnote: But if you know neither bachata nor ballet, theres always the all-important B to fall back on. Just do a Priyanka Chopra or a Shahid Kapur and rock the floor.        
	Bollywood gives you many different options. And no party is complete without some Bolly tracks. So it is still enough for you to know popular Bolly steps for the party season, says choreographer Chandan Verma.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Delhi blueprint for HS revamp
                                                                                                               Delhi blueprint for HS revamp
  - National parity key to new syllabus        MITA MUKHERJEE                                                  
	The Higher Secondary (HS) syllabus is set to be remodelled on the national-level curriculum prepared by the human resource development ministry.        
	The move follows a directive from the Centre, which wants all plus-II boards in the country to follow the ministrys curriculum to bring about a uniformity in the education imparted to school-leaving students.        
	The revised syllabus is likely to be implemented from the next academic session. The changes being made are in tune with the Union ministrys guidelines, said Onkar Sadhan Adhikari, the president of the state HS council.        
	Sources said other states, too, would make the switch in 2010.        
	The HS syllabus was last revised in 2006 and implemented the next year.        
	During the last revision, our priority was to establish a parity with the syllabi of the two Delhi-based boards that are popular in Bengal, the Central Board of Secondary Education and the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations. The Centre-directed changes will take the process a step further, achieving a parity with the curricula of all plus-II boards across India, said an official of the council.        
	Once the new curriculum is introduced across the country, it will be easier for a school-leaving student from one state board to pursue graduation in any other state, he added.        
	A copy of the Union ministrys curriculum was sent to the HS council in August. We were asked to send our views at the earliest, said Adhikari.        
	The council subsequently formed subject committees comprising experts to study the syllabus. The panels have submitted their observations and we will send our report to the Centre by next week, Adhikari said.        
	Officials said the council had been given certain freedom to select topics in social sciences. But for the science subjects, the ministry had insisted that its curriculum be followed by all boards, said an official.        
	Sources privy to deliberations of the expert panels said there might be some redistribution of science topics once the Centres syllabus is accepted. For instance, an expert in chemistry said the chapter on solid state might be shifted from physics to chemistry. Students will also have to learn various mechanisms of organic chemistry which have so far been kept out of the syllabus.        
	A member of the expert committee on physics said the content of the science syllabi of the state council was 20 per cent less than that of the CBSE/ICSE curriculum as well as the one prepared by the central ministry.        
	The physics syllabus, he pointed out, does not extensively cover modern areas such as quantum physics, semi-conductor and Bose theory. That is one reason why the success rate of our students at all-India entrance tests, such as the IIT joint entrance examination, is so low. In contrast, those studying the CBSE or ISC curriculum get to study these topics in detail and fare much better, said the expert who did not want to be named.

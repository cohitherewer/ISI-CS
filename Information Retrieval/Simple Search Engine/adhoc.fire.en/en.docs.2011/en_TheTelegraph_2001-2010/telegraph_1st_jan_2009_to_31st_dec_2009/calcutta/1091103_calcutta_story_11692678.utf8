The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Wasteland to woo Premji
                                                                            Tuesday , November 3 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Wasteland to woo Premji
          A STAFF REPORTER                                             
	A 50-acre plot in Action Area III of Rajarhat, with no infrastructure in sight, is the land of hope for the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government desperate to resurrect the bruised Brand Bengal.        
	The state government has earmarked this plot for Wipro, the IT major is yet to accept the proposal. But Team Bhattacharjee is confident that the Bangalore-headquartered company will seal the deal for its second campus on what now resembles a wasteland.        
	In the aftermath of the Vedic Village controversy, Wipros acceptance of the offer will surely have a positive impact on the states image. The chief minister is actively involved in seeing the deal through and he is in touch with Azim Premji, said a senior government official.        
	IT industry sources stress that Wipros decision to set up its first campus in Calcutta in 2004 had a positive rub-off on Brand Bengal besides creating employment for 5,000-plus people. By convincing the company to have a second address, the state government is trying to tide over the Singur and Vedic Village crises and send out a positive signal.        
	According to sources in Hidco, which owns the land, the chief ministers desperation could help vault the price barrier that has come in the way of Wipros expansion plans ever since Hidco quoted Rs 2.16 crore per acre four years ago. The government will now do everything to sweeten the deal and get Wipro a good bargain, said a source in Writers Buildings.        
	But the question is whether that would be enough to convince Wipro to set up its second campus opposite the Shapoorji Pallonji-promoted Information Technology Space on the East-West Main Arterial Road in Rajarhat.        
	The six-lane road that leads to the plot, close to the 100-acre Uniworld housing project by Unitech, is a nightmare. As protests against forceful land acquisition are still brewing in parts of Rajarhat, steady supply of electricity remains a distant dream.         
	In the absence of a detailed and deadline-bound infrastructure development plan, there is no clarity on when basic civic amenities  water supply, proper drainage system and waste management  would reach the area.        
	It is unlikely that Wipro will start construction work soon. So the government should use this opportunity to fast-track infrastructure development in Rajarhat, said an IT industry insider.

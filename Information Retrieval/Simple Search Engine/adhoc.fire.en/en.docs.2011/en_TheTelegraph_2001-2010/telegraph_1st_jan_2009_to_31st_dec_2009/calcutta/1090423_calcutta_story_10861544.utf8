The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Predator promises to protect   Pressure on poll panel
                                                                                                               Predator promises to protect     - Pressure mounts on panel to spare National Library the poll bruises          A STAFF REPORTER                          Metro has been running a series of stories to thwart the Election Commissions bid to invade National Library.                                       
	The Election Commission will take over only an unused portion of National Library, tiptoe into the premises rather than barge in, and clean up before leaving, chief electoral officer Debashis Sen promised on Wednesday.         
	The verbal assurances  similar to the written undertaking that political parties are required to give to the army before using the much-mauled Maidan  came even as opposition to the poll-related takeover mounted and readers accused the commission of arm-twisting.        
	We will use only the old building on counting day. Hopefully, readers wont face any problem, Sen told Metro.        
	Director K.K Banerjee did not seem convinced. I have yet to receive a detailed plan from the Election Commission. I will comment on the issue only after going through the plan, he said.        
	Regulars at the library were vehement in their opposition to the move to turn the Alipore address into a counting centre. National Library is a heritage institution meant for academia. It is shocking that the commission is determined to turn it into a poll office, protested archivist Kamalika Mukherjee.                     
	The old building has been vacant ever since the reading room was shifted to the newly constructed Bhasha Bhawan on the same 30-acre campus        
	The returning officer for Calcutta South, B.P. Gopalika, said microphones would not be used and poll personnel would not stay on the premises for more than a couple of days.                                
	Gopalika assured the library authorities that the holes drilled on the lawns to set up tents would be filled up before the poll personnel left the premises. We cannot help it. Tents have to be pegged to accommodate the poll personnel, he said.        
	But National Library surely was not the only option available. It would have been better had the commission looked at other venues (as suggested by Sukanta Chaudhuri in Metro), said Saibal Chakraborty of the staff association.        
	Professor Irfan Habib of Aligarh Muslim University, who visits the library whenever he is in town, said: One has the right to do many things. One does not excercise them all the time. Libraries and universities may have very large buildings but these should not be disturbed. In my constituency, they (the authorities) consult us before making such decisions.

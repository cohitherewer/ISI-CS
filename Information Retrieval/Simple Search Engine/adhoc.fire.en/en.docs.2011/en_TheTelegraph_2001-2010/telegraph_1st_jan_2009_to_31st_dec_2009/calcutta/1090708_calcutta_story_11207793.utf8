The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Crackdown on old vehicles
                                                                                                               Crackdown on old vehicles
  - Green lobby sees ploy to spark chaos        OUR BUREAU                                                   
	The transport department has announced a crackdown on the 10,000-odd old commercial vehicles from July 25, just a week before the deadline on their phase-out.        
	Vehicle operators have opposed the move and threatened an indefinite strike, while environmentalists questioned the governments motive, pointing at the year-long inaction since the high court set the deadline. Traffic police, on the other hand, are sceptical about honouring the ruling.        
	Taxi operators have called an indefinite strike from July 22, while bus and minibus operators have threatened to follow suit from July 23 to protest government atrocities against transporters.        
	The government will start a crackdown on commercial vehicles more than 15 years old on July 25, transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury said on Tuesday afternoon, after meeting Road Transport Authority officials, speed governor experts and representatives of the city and state police at Metro Rail Bhavan.        
	Chowdhury later told Metro that 2,553 buses, 573 minibuses and 6,357 taxis came under the purview of the ban. From July 24, the police and the transport department would launch a joint drive to ensure that none of the vehicles could ply. The vehicles, however, will not be seized.        
	Asked about the problems commuters would face if so many vehicles are suddenly taken off the road, Chowdhury said: We cant help it. The transport operators were offered alternative packages long ago.... The court order has left us with no other option.        
	Environmentalists slammed the government for trying to achieve the impossible, setting out to do in seven days what it should have done in a planned manner over the past year.         
	The court announced the ban on July 18, 2008. Was the government sleeping so long? wondered green activist Subhash Dutta, whose petition has led to a series of rulings aimed at curbing vehicular pollution in the city.         
	The government is trying to trigger chaos which will build pressure on the court to offer some relief to vehicle operators, Dutta added.         
	How effectively can the governments decision be implemented? A senior officer in the traffic department of Lalbazar said: Its not difficult to know the age of a vehicle from its bluebook but there is practically no chance of meeting the court deadline.         
	Even all officers in all 14 traffic guards across the city are not enough to accomplish the task within a span of seven days, said another officer.         
	And if the entire force is deployed for the task, what will happen to normal traffic policing? What will happen if there is a sudden backlash, resulting in a law and order problem? the officer asked.         
	Transport operators, on their part, have vowed to put a spanner in the governments drive. We face a lot of harassment from the police and other departments of the government. In the name of enforcing the ban, we will be subjected to another round of torture. Its now time for us to act, said Swarnakamal Saha, the president of the Bengal Bus Syndicate.         
	Abashesh Daw, the general secretary of the Minibus Coordination Committee, echoed Saha.         
	If all transport organisations go ahead with their strike plan, as many as 10,000 buses, 1,000 minibuses and 42,000 taxis will be off the road.         
	The Taxi Bachao Committee, an umbrella organisation of all taxi unions, has also demanded an increase in fares because of the recent fuel price hike.         
	We demand a nominal hike of Rs 2 for the initial 2km, which would take the minimum fare to Rs 22, said Tarak Nath Bari, the secretary of the Calcutta Taxi Association.

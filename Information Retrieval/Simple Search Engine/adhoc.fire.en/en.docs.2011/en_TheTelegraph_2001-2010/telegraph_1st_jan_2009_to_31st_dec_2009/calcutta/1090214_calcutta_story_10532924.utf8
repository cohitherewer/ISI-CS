The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Girl at helm of Presidency union
                                                                                                               Girl at helm of Presidency union
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	The students union of Presidency College will be led by a girl for the second time in its history.        
	Richa Gupta (picture left), a second-year English (hons) student, was elected general secretary of the union on Friday, two days after SFI wrested control from the Independents Consolidation. The last time the union was headed by a woman was 20 years ago, when Rupam Biswas became general secretary.        
	A woman general secretary for the second time sounds good but not too much should be read into it as the responsibility remains the same, said Richa, who stays in the Presidency College Girls Hostel in Salt Lake.        
	Richa was born in Jamshedpur, where she did her ICSE from Sacred Heart Convent and ISC from Loyola School.        
	Richa said circumstances had forced her to join student politics. I did not have any express interest in politics. But when things go wrong and you feel an urge to set them right, you have to get involved.

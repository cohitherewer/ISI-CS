The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Road rogues rule by hook or by crook 
                                                                                                               Road rogues rule by hook or by crook 
          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI JHINUK MAZUMDAR                          Bijan Kumar Dhars widow Jharna at the shradh ceremony on Monday. (Amit Datta)                                  
	When an unknown vehicle crushed 62-year-old accountant Bijan Kumar Dhar under its wheels last Friday, he became just another piece of statistic in Calcutta polices records on rash driving.        
	I am mourning my fathers death and the killer driver responsible for it is still at large. The police have all the information about the accident except the identity of the guilty. Its ridiculous, Dhars son Sushanta, 32, said on Monday.        
	The Dum Dum-based family is among the many who suffer because of loophole-ridden laws and lax policing on the mean streets of the city.         
	Around 35 lives are lost in road accidents on an average every month, most of them because of rash driving, but the drivers invariably get away with either a token fine or no punishment. Rogue drivers whose licences are seized get back on the road with duplicate ones issued by the regional transport office. A tout charges between Rs 700 and Rs 1,200 for one.        
	It is the polices duty to update lists of drivers booked for offences. It takes them more than a month to notify us about a rogue driver whose licence has been seized, by which time he might have procured a duplicate one by claiming to have lost the original, said a transport department official.        
	Metro leafed through the Lalbazar files to realise how lack of effort, procedural delays and weak laws are responsible for the polices abysmal record in tracking down and penalising rogue drivers.         
	Case study I: Accountant Bijan Kumar Dhar was walking down Old Court House Road in the central business district around 1.30pm last Friday when a vehicle ran him over near Mangoe Lane.        
	Witnesses told Dhars family that there was a sizeable police presence in the traffic kiosks along the route when the accident occurred because the chief ministers convoy had passed by minutes earlier. But no cop apparently noticed the vehicle that crushed Dhar and sped away.        
	When Dhars son Sushanta wanted to file an FIR, an officer of the Hare Street police station said a case had already been lodged. But the rogue driver remains unknown.        
	Case study II: The driver of a school bus was critically injured and 15 schoolchildren had a narrow escape when a private bus (WBS-5250) on route 43/1 hit the vehicle at the crossing of Raja Raj Krishna Street and Bidhan Sarani on Friday.        
	Burtolla police station, which is investigating the accident, is yet to trace the driver of the private bus. An officer said a case had been registered against the driver under Section 279, pertaining to rash and negligent driving, and claimed that manpower shortage was to blame for the delay in bringing him to book.        
	Most cases remain pending, especially those involving unknown vehicles, because local police stations dont do their job properly, said an officer of the fatal squad.        
	Apart from the blame game between police stations and the fatal squad affecting investigation, accident cases generally get less importance in police stations than other incidents, admit officers.        
	Case study III: An 80-year-old man, Arjun Sardar, was seriously injured on being hit by a taxi (WB 04 9584) on Mayurbhanj Road in Ekbalpore on May 31. The driver, Shamim Akhtar Siddique, was arrested and the vehicle seized.         
	By the time a probe revealed that he had been involved in two other accidents earlier that day, Shamim was out on bail. Being found to be under the influence of alcohol actually saved him from a serious charge like culpable homicide, an officer of Ekbalpore police station said.

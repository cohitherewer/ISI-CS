The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hike your fees, but have a heart
                                                                                                               Hike your fees, but have a heart
  - Govt tells schools to take reasonable route, ease burden on guardians          A STAFF REPORTER                                                      
	The state government has appealed to schools to take a reasonable and judicious approach while deciding on a fee hike and to do it in consultation with guardians.        
	This missive from the director of school education on Monday comes in the wake of growing protests from guardians against the fee hike at several schools.        
	The institutions have said the implementation of the Fifth Pay Commission prompting a rise in teachers salaries had forced them to hike fees.        
	It has been brought to our notice that quite a few non-government DA-getting or unaided English-medium schools affiliated to ICSE and CBSE have either raised or are contemplating to raise their respective school fees reportedly in order to disburse salaries to their staff on a par with government norms. Such action has caused widespread resentment amongst guardians of the students of the concerned schools in this state, states the note from the state government to the schools.        
	Many private schools have raised their fees by 50 to 80 per cent triggering protests by parents across the city. Guardians of students of schools like Loyola, St Anthonys, Patha Bhavan, St Aloysius (Howrah) and St Teresas have organised protests, demanding a rollback.        
	Guardians were delighted by the governments move. We want the schools to raise fees in a reasonable manner, maybe in instalments, to lessen the burden on us. That is exactly what the government has requested, said Faiz Alam, the general secretary of the association of parents of St Anthonys High School.        
	We understand the parents plight but we are helpless. We wouldnt need to raise the fees if we did not have to match the Fifth Pay Commission, argued a principal.        
	The schools would also like the government to do its bit for them. We are ready to accept the governments request but they should also request teachers not to ask for the immediate implementation of the Fifth Pay Commission scale, said Father Moloy D Costa, the education inspector of Roman Catholic schools.

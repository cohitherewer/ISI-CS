          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The decomposed body of an unidentified woman in her mid-20s was found in a jute sack dumped in a drain along Hyde Road, in the Port area, on Monday morning.        
	Civic sweepers found the sack and alerted police. Cops said the hands and feet of the woman, who was wearing a green salwar kameez, were tied up and there were injuries on the back of her head.        
	It looks like the woman was pregnant. However, we have sent the body for post-mortem for confirmation, said an officer of West Port police station.        
	According to the investigators, the woman was killed at least 48 hours ago and dumped in the drain early on Monday.

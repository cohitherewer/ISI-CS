                                                 New avatar: Apropos ldquo;Reborn, Sourav the puja dancer rdquo;, October 1, it was thrilling to see Sourav Ganguly beat the dhak during immersion of Durga idols. Given that Ganguly is the most successful Indian skipper and lauded as one of the finest players of the game, I hope he builds a full-fledged cricket academy in the   city and teaches the basics of the game to budding cricketers, who can later go on to don the   Indian jersey.

	Apropos Light rail system for swift commute, October 7, the increase of mass rapid transport options in Calcutta is welcome as it will reduce traffic congestion and pollution. We have already seen how the north-south Metro Railway has brought a paradigm shift in transportation in the city. An east-west corridor is also being constructed to connect Salt Lake/Rajarhat with Howrah through the business district of BBD Bag. It is heartening to note that the south-west, hitherto neglected in this regard, is catching the authorities eye.           
	The Railways is planning a light rail transit (LRT) from Majherhat to Joka and on to Diamond Harbour, Budge Budge, Garden Reach, Kidderpore and finally Tollygunge. However, an LRT project connecting Barrackpore with Joka via Majherhat has already been launched by the chief minister on February 18, 2009, on behalf of the state government. Surely, both are not required, between Majherhat and Joka at least. Citizens will be served best if the planners work out a single plan. Of course, the biggest challenge is the political hurdle. If this can be overcome in the greater interest of the public, it will be a great service to the city.

	Apropos Perishable rot, prices rocket, September 19, a few days back I found potatoes being sold through ration shops at a subsidised rate. However, most of the buyers looked well-to-do, no one in the queue was from the lower middle class, let alone from below poverty line families. Do the rich need subsidised potatoes at the cost of taxpayers money? On the other hand, the people of Lalgarh have not got any subsidised food, not even ration cards.             
	The charade of food price control should be stopped immediately. Food price control can be achieved only by increasing production. India has 160 million hectares of arable land, sufficient to feed 200crore people if agriculture is modernised. But farming needs to be made profitable for farmers so that they opt for modernisation. The government should purchase commodities at the market rate and sell the same at subsidised rates to the poor. The government must ensure that subsidy does not get siphoned off by undeserving people.

	The common peoples condition has become pathetic because of unexpected rise in the prices of essential items (Onion price spells tears, October 8). On one hand, most peoples salaries have remained stagnant and on the other, everything from sugar to vegetables is becoming costlier by the day. Both the central and state governments have taken a few initiatives to control prices, but they did not work. The authorities should take the problem more seriously and find a remedy soon.           
	Sourish Misra,
  Salt Lake                               
	The report Wetlands: worth and violation, September 21, was most informative. Considering that the wetlands are the kidneys of Calcutta, the government must ensure that the 22 acres of wetlands usurped for the construction of Sanjeeva Town by Vedic Village director R.K. Modi is taken back. The wetlands should be restored to the original condition after demolishing the residential complex and the cost should be recovered from Modi and his men.             
	A.S. Mehta,
  New Alipore                               
	The Jadavpur University authorities did the right thing by five students in compliance with the University Grants Commission (UGC)s recommendations (Ragging axe dangles on five JU students, September 17). It seems the insouciant misdemeanours of the present generation of students would not stop even under threat. This was not the first time that students were found guilty of ragging on the JU campus. As the report mentioned, the authorities had suspended three architecture students and 21 others were slapped fines for making a first-year girl student drink alcohol, smoke marijuana and chew cigarettes. It defies comprehension how these chivalrous seniors are yet to wake up despite the severe UGC diktat.             
	P.B. Saha,
  Panipat                               
	Apropos English section in state school (October 10), it is good for our future generation that English-medium sections are going to be opened from 2010 in all state-run Bengali-medium schools. It is also appreciable that our school education minister desires that non-Bengali students enrol themselves in Bengali-medium schools.             
	May I ask him why proficiency in Bengali has been made compulsory for WBCS examination, which bars non-Bengalis from taking it? Working knowledge for communicating should have served the purpose.           
	Md.Moinuddin,
  Jamadar Khan Lane                     
	It is encouraging that state-run schools are now set to open English medium sections. This is great news for students who cannot afford the hefty fees charged by private English-medium institutions. If school education minister Partha De is sincere in his effort to start such classes from the next academic session, thus giving the opportunity of education in English for a reduced fee, middle class parents will rush to get their children admitted in state-run schools.           
	But with the Left Front governments boat further with every election, how far the education minister will be capable of putting his plans in operation is the question.           
	Sukumar Ghosh,
  Mukundapur                               
	Apropos Reap what you sow, its all in the game, October 1, I am hooked to Farmville, available on Facebook. It is much better than blood-and-gore action games or racing games. To be able to own a farm is such a pleasure, planting seeds and then seeing them grow is an awesome experience. But climbing the levels isnt easy, it requires planning and strategic savings, much like in real life. So its cheers to farming from air-conditioned offices and cosy homes.             
	Sreetama Bose,
  Address not mentioned                     
	I use the Facebook application regularly. The concept is so attractive and exciting that I just cannot stop myself from logging in. I use the game as a stress-buster in between work. The game compels me to compete with my friends to gain more coins, to make my farm look attractive and gain experience to move to the next level. I would like to congratulate Facebook and Zynga for creating Farmville. It is by far the best application available on social networking sites.           
	M. Shaifullah,
  Address not mentioned                               
	I was shocked at the report Only business class for MP, dated December 1. The report is false, frivolous and reeks of bias.             
	The report claims that while I had insisted on my ticket being upgraded from economy to business class, my aides had shouted at airlines employees at the Air India check-in counter. An airlines check-in counter is situated within a high security zone. Therefore, it is absurd to even imagine that people who came to see me off would be allowed entry in such a well-protected zone to enable them to shout at airlines employees.           
	It is amazing to note that sources and anonymous persons have been quoted to claim what should have become public knowledge, given the circumstances. It has been claimed that employees gave in to avoid harassment of other passengers.           
	It is a usual practice on the part of most airlines to upgrade tickets when executive class seats are vacant. What was offered to me was no more than routine procedure. There was no reason to politicise the case by painting it against a backdrop of austerity.           
	Sultan Ahmed,
  Minister of state for tourism,
  Government of India                     
	Metro replies: We stand by our report. Although the check-in counter is in the high security zone, it is common practice for VIPs to be accompanied by officials on special duty and aides till the check-in counters. Both Air India and airport sources had confirmed that the airline was initially reluctant to upgrade the minister. Their names were withheld on request. A ticket is upgraded only when the economy class is full. But in this case, a number of seats in the economy class were vacant.     Letters on reports appearing   in Metro may be sent to:

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Retail spreads wings to ride festive wind to revival
                                                                                                               Retail spreads wings to ride festive wind to revival
  - Food, apparel and lifestyle brands brave downturn to increase presence in malls before Puja          SUBHRO SAHA                          SHOP TILL YOU DROP: The interiors of South City Mall                                         
	After a season of shutdowns, a slew of big brands is braving the downturn to roll out expansion plans in anticipation of a festive turnaround for retail.         
	Pizza Hut, KFC, Subway, Fabindia, Sony Centre, Kaya and Prime Watch World are among the 15-odd brands setting up shop at South City Mall, on Prince Anwar Shah Road, over the next month.         
	Mani Square, on the EM Bypass, is also not missing the action. Fashion Bazaar, from the Future Group stable that includes Pantaloons, is ready to unveil a 10,000sq ft shop at the mall. The market buzz is that more brands will follow suit in the weeks leading to the start of festive buying beginning with Puja.         
	We are delighted to bring to our property such a strong cluster of brands. The idea is to refresh the overall product-mix and break the monotony, said Sanjeev Mehra, the vice-president of mall operations at South City.         
	For KFC, the quick-service chicken restaurant chain, the South City counter will be its fourth outlet in Calcutta after the ones at City Centre in Salt Lake, Park Street and New Market.         
	Pizza Hut isnt chickening out from expanding either despite the shadow of the downturn still looming large. South City will be its fifth stop after the outlets at 22 Camac Street, City Centre, Forum and Sector V.         
	Calcutta has been wonderfully receptive to all our formats, and our Salt Lake outlets have recorded 21 per cent growth even in these lean times. That gives us the belief that our upcoming stops, both at South City Mall and City Centre New Town, will do just as well, Hridesh Sarna, senior manager of business development at franchisee Devyani International, said from Delhi.         
	The group will also bring Costa Coffee to the two malls despite a dip in sales forcing the Sector V outlet to shut shop. The only operational outlet of the UK coffee-shop chain in town now is at Mani Square.         
	City Centre New Town, which is dolling up for a festive unveiling, will be anchored by INOX, Pantaloons, Hangout  The Food Court, McDonalds, Pizza Hut and KFC.         
	The city has witnessed a spate of shutdowns this year with the list of casualties including the bookshop-cum-music store Odyssey, Adidass flagship store, Reebok Classics, Guess and Next.

           The long and short of it: Apropos Star trek in town: a report card, October 29, Metro commented on the uncoolest thing Katrina did while in Calcutta  tugging at her short dress and covering her thighs with her hands. Maybe Katrina did not choose her own dress. Anyway, for an Indian woman, there is nothing uncool about trying to cover her thighs or trying to be modest in public. It shows that whatever she does in films, in public she retains a sense of decency and dignity.

	Calcutta, a city with a heart, was witness to a heartless incident. A man, smashed from the waist-down by a bus, lay screaming for help for 20 hours at one of the busiest spots in Howrah (20-hour wait for helping hand, October 27).           
	Calcutta evokes mixed emotions. On many occasions, the citizens have come forward to help strangers but the incident in Howrah has dealt a blow to the citys tradition of warmth. Let us hope there is no recurrence of such an uncharitable incident in future.           
	P.B. Saha,
  Salt Lake                     
	It is time for introspection on why Calcuttans fear police harassment while doing something humane. It is not that people were unwilling to help the accident victim, but they did not because they feared harassment from the police. The police brass and the government should probe why this happened and take corrective measures.

	Apropos Parents train for admission test October 29, ideally admissions to the nursery section should be through computerised random selection. This would help curb the practice of paying hefty sums to secure a seat. The system of parents being interviewed is restrictive as many parents may not be able to afford coaching centres. The government must ensure that a certain percentage of children from weaker sections are inducted in reputable schools.

  New Alipore                               
	Apropos of Illegal parking sparks mishap, October 28, I would like to add that the travails of travellers on BT Road know no bounds. Apart from the parking menace, there are innumerable illegal garages on both sides of the road. There is an auto stand on one side of the Sinthee crossing and a rickshaw stand on the other. This leads to nightmarish traffic jams during peak hours. There is, however, at least a semblance of traffic control up to the Sinthee crossing from Shyambazar but between Sinthee and Barrackpore, the road is free for all, with vehicles flouting every conceivable traffic law.             
	Anupam Deb,

	My 81-year-old father, Ajit Chakraborty, died of septic shock at the Rabindranath Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences on December 2, but we were never told during his 21-day stay in the hospital that he had suffered a sepsis. On November 11, my father had chest pain and low haemoglobin count (5.4) and consulted Dr J. Nayak, a cardiologist at the hospital. He refused to admit my father and referred him to Dr Abhijit Pal of general medicines, who advised admission.             
	My father was admitted in the general ward and given one unit of blood daily for the next three days. On the third day, he was given oxygen as he had respiratory distress and a fever. From November 16 onwards, he could hardly eat but his haemoglobin count rose to 9.5.           
	The next day, Dr Pal said the patient had kidney problems and transferred the case to Dr D.K. Pahari. He saw my father a day later and prescribed emergency dialysis. After the third dialysis, Dr Pahari suggested a small surgery known as AV Fistula. But my father started suffering from blood diarrhoea.           
	On November 26, we learnt that Dr Pahari has resigned and left the hospital. According to medical council rules, an outgoing doctor has to introduce his replacement to the patient and his relatives. The hospital had no satisfactory explanation for Dr Paharis behaviour. The fourth dialysis was done.           
	On November 27, the hospital informed us that Dr Pratik Das had taken over the case, but the next day, Dr D.S. Roy took charge. Dr Roy said my father could be discharged the next day, but when we told him about his deteriorating condition, he assured us that he would examine the patient.           
	The fifth dialysis was done as well as AV Fistula surgery. On November 29, my fathers abdomen became huge with water deposit. Dr M. Tiwari, RMO, and the next day Dr S. Dubey, gastroenterologist, suggested various procedures but my fathers condition deteriorated drastically. On December 1, he was put on ventilation. The next day at 7.15am we were informed that my father had died after a heart attack. The death certificate mentioned the cause of death as septic shock. But neither the doctors nor the hospital staff had told us that he was suffering from sepsis.           
	Samprity Dey,

	 Reply: We are looking into the details of the case and will not comment on this at the moment, said a senior official of the hospital.     Letters on reports appearing   in Metro may be sent to:

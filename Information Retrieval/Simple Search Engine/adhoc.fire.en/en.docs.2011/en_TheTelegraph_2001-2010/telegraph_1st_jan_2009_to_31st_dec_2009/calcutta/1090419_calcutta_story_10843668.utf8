                                                                                                               Next weekend you can be at ... Pedong
                                          
	Pedong is a small village about 26 km from Kalimpong. Pe means scented tree and Dong means resting place. So Pedong denotes a resting place beneath a scented tree.         
	We took the Kamrup Express to New Jalpaiguri and then set off for Pedong by road.         
	It was quite cloudy when we reached Pedong. A cool breeze was blowing. Surrounded by high hills and lush green trees, the place charmed us instantly. An amazing peace and tranquillity prevailed in the entire area.         
	We checked into Dadul Guesthouse at Chumir Chen, a small village far from the hustle and bustle of the city. The owner of the guesthouse welcomed us with a warm smile.         
	It is said Pedong offers the best view of the majestic Kanchenjunga as the peak is closer to this place than other tourist spots in the vicinity. But during our stay, the clouds played spoilsport, hiding the mighty peak from us.         
	Nestled in the lap of nature, Pedong is ideal for long walks. There are many attractions too. The Tibetan monastery is a must see. The ruins of the Damsang Durg (fort) are also worth a visit. We also visited Rikisum view point and Cross Hill viewpoint.         
	The next day we took a trip to Aritar Lake and Rishi bridge and enjoyed a picnic on the bank of Rishikhola river. The scenic beauty of the place is magnificent.         
	From Pedong, one can visit Lava and Lolegaon on day trips. At Lava, we visited the Lava Wildlife Interpretation Centre.         
	The Neora Valley National Park is also situated nearby. It is a dense forest with Sikkim and Bhutan on its north and the Dooars of Jalpaiguri district on its southern boundary. The forest is rich in a diverse range of flora and fauna.         
	Going         
	The nearest airport is Bagdogra and the nearest railway station is New Jalpaiguri. Buses and taxis are available for the onward journey to Pedong.              
	Staying        
	Dadul Guesthouse at 20th Mile, Churnir Chen, PO-Algarah-Kalimpong.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Teen held for kids murder
                                                                                                               Teen held for kids murder
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 17-year-old rickshawpuller was arrested on Friday for the murder of a five-year-old girl whose body was found in an abandoned jute mill in Lake Town on January 1.        
	Police said Subhajit Das (name changed), a resident of Dakshindari in Lake Town, had allegedly tried to rape Ankita Manna on New Years Eve and killed her when she raised an alarm.        
	Subhajit has confessed to the crime, said Supratim Sarkar, the superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas.         
	Ankitas body was found beside a ditch inside the mill complex. We were certain the girl didnt drown and had been taken there by someone. The motive eluded us initially as the medical report didnt suggest rape, said an officer.         
	Ankita, a resident of Kestopur, had come to her maternal uncles home in Dakshindari for the treatment of her father, an autorickshaw driver.        
	While probing the case, the police ran a check on the New Years Eve parties in the area and zeroed in on Subhajit, who was celebrating with friends at a local club. He was drinking with two friends when he spotted the girl who was asking for a balloon from some children, Sarkar said.        
	Subhajit approached Ankita and promised her a balloon. He then took her to the abandoned factory. As he started undressing her, she screamed for help and said she would inform her parents about him, the police said.        
	Subhajit said he had panicked and covered the girls face with his hands to muffle her voice. As he pressed his hands on her face for more than 15 minutes, she was smothered to death, an officer said.        
	Subhajit then dumped the body near the ditch to make it look like an accidental death.

                                                                                                               Revenge whiff in boy kidnap
          A STAFF REPORTER                          A teacher of MC Kejriwal Vidyapeeth in Liluah on Friday escorting children to the gate of the school from where Yash went missing on Thursday. Picture by Gopal Senapati                                      
	Revenge emerged the stronger motive than ransom in the suspected kidnapping of businessman Anil Lakhotias son Yash even as police groped for clues to the seven-year-olds whereabouts.        
	Two sacked employees of Panch Bhog, the landmark Howrah sweet shop owned by Yashs father, are among the suspects, a source close to the family said on Friday.        
	More than 24 hours have passed since Yash went missing but the Lakhotias havent received any ransom call. Whoever is holding the boy captive might not be doing it mainly for money, he said.        
	The Howrah superintendent of police, Niraj Kumar Singh, would neither confirm nor deny that Nabin and Joydeep, the two youths from Amta who lost their jobs a couple of months ago for alleged theft, were suspects. Our investigation is on the right track but I cant reveal anything now, he said.        
	The focus on Amta had led to speculation about a police team rescuing Yash from a house in that locality in the morning. But it turned out to be a rumour.        
	Yash, a student of Class II at MC Kejriwal Vidyapeeth in Liluah, did not return home from school on Thursday. A classmate, Kailash Saraogi, saw him holding a mans hand and walking out of the campus before the pool car that was to take him home arrived.        
	A source said Nabin and Joydeep had been to the school with the Lakhotias driver on a few occasions earlier to escort Yash back home in the family car.                   Yash Lakhotia, who went missing on Thursday afternoon       
	The driver of the pool car, Ganesh Rai, and his helpers, Dharma Raut and Biswanath Rai, are under detention for not being able to satisfactorily explain why they reached the school 20 minutes later than usual on Thursday. The guard who was on duty that day, Jaikishen Mahato, has also been detained.        
	Parents of students who commute by pool cars descended on the school on Friday morning to demand an explanation for Yashs disappearance. Purnima Jaiswal, whose son Pratik is in the same class as Yash, blamed the schools policy of not allowing pool cars to enter the campus for the incident.        
	Drivers or their helpers are supposed to escort our children out and herd them into the vehicles parked on the road. It isnt possible for a driver to manage a large group of children every day. I am now jittery about sending my son to school in a pool car, she said.        
	Kishan Kejriwal, a member of the trust that runs the school, promised steps to make the campus safer for students. Till now, only kindergarten students and their escorts were required to display identity cards. All students up to Class II and their escorts will have to carry identity cards from next week.        
	At the Lakhotias GT Road apartment, Yashs mother Anita spent the day in tears staring at the main door, hoping her son would walk in safe and smiling.        
	Please bring him back. I dont want anything else, she said.        
	Residents of the neighbourhood staged a road blockade near the Howrah Maidan for 45 minutes from 8.30am to protest the kidnapping.

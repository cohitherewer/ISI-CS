The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Write as Rowling
                                                                                                                   Write as Rowling

	J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series, started writing at the age of six. Her first story was about a rabbit, called Rabbit, who got measles and was visited by friends, among them a giant bee called Miss Bee.         
	For the 15 youngsters who took part in this years Scholastic Writing Awards for children aged between 10-16, the story-reading session at Oxford bookstore, Park Street, on June 26, was an opportunity to showcase their skills before their peers. The competition had two parts: fiction and non-fiction.         
	The topic in the non-fiction category was what democracy means to me, while in the fiction category, kids could write a short story on a topic of their choice.         
	Kanishk Kanakia, a student of The Heritage School, and Nirvana Guha of Vivekananda Mission School, Joka, were among the 20 whose entries were shortlisted for By Kids for Kids, an annual publication by Scholastic of the award-winning entries.         
	Kanishks story Bholu was about a young boy, whose father, unable to feed his children, joins a terrorist organisation that plans to carry out bomb blasts in a busy market.         
	Unknown to him, his wife and daughter visit the market the same day and fall victim to the attack. I wrote it as a reaction to the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks, said the Class VII student, who also has a blackbelt in kickboxing and tae kwon do.         
	Nirvanas The Gompa of the Black Lama was about four friends, who on a trip to Sikkim, encounter several mysterious people, including a lama who plays a black flute.        
	Mary Ann Dasgupta, an educator and founder of the NGO, Sharehouse Charitable Trust, was present to pep up the spirit of the children.         
	Schools should nurture budding authors by encouraging them to take up creative writing. Awards like these help to turn the spotlight on writing talent, said Dasgupta.         
	Similar book-reading sessions were organised on the same day at branches of Oxford bookstore in other cities, including Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore.

	Moon as Earth chronicle        
	ASTRONOMer rues lack of focus on basic sciences            G. Madhavan Nair accepts the MP Birla Memorial Award       
	The moon may appear soft and smooth from afar, but it contains mountainous regions and ravines. Studying it can help us understand what the earth was like millions of years ago, said G. Madhavan Nair, the chairman of the Space Commission and Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro).         
	Nair was in the city on July 4 to receive the MP Birla Memorial Award, given every alternate year for exceptional achievement in the fields of astronomy, astrophysics, space science and allied disciplines, by the MP Birla Institute of Fundamental Research. The award includes a cash sum of Rs 2,51,000. He also delivered an address on the topic, Indian scientific explorations in space, to a packed auditorium at MP Birla Planetarium.        
	Nair began with the first rocket launch in 1963 and showed how technology has been revolutionised over the years with distance education and health facilities available today. Satellites for earth observation can now help manage natural resources, identify fishery sources and be used for wasteland mapping, he said.         
	This city has contributed a lot to science and some great institutions have come up here, but today attention to the basic sciences is lacking here, as in all the other states, rued Nair. He also highlighted the achievements of Chandrayaan-1 through a slide show.         
	Chandrayaan-1, a dream project of Isro, was launched on October 22 last year. It carried 11 instruments to map the entire surface of the moon.         
	There are higher expectations from Chandrayaan-2 after the safe landing of Chandrayaan-1. With it, we want to have a closer look at the moon. We hope that in 2013, the Chandrayaan-2 rover will be able to move over the moon. We are working on a way to land it without too much impact, said Nair.         
	Aditya, scheduled for a 2012-13 take-off, is another mission that will carry instruments to monitor emissions from the sun. Though it will be some time yet till an Indian sets foot on the moon, low-cost access to space is being explored and climate change studies are also being incorporated in Isro missions, he added.

	Whats on your mind this week  Ugly face of man  
	Education and technology are said to have gone a long way in enlightening man and creating a civilised society free of all prejudices. Despite all the progress, the ugly face of man remains unchanged.         
	The racial attacks on Indians in Australia is an example and shows that racism still exists. We have to first learn to accept human beings as they are. If all men are created equal, why should differences in race matter? Why cant we accept ethnic diversity?        
	The barbarity of these racial attacks makes one ashamed to think that this is another face of man.         
	Are we returning to the dark ages when people would be discriminated against for any kind of difference, including race, religion and language?

	An act of cowardice        
	Mahatma Gandhi once said: If boys and girls do not learn discipline in their school days, money and time spent on their education is a national waste. The recent examples of ragging in colleges are blazing examples of how low our morality has fallen. People seem to obtain sadistic pleasure from inflicting pain on innocent people.         
	Ragging is like a tradition. The previous generation who had been ragged by their seniors bears a grudge and, in turn, rags the juniors. Inflicting pain is not an act of bravery but of cowardice. The malaise is eroding our academic system and should be stopped for good.

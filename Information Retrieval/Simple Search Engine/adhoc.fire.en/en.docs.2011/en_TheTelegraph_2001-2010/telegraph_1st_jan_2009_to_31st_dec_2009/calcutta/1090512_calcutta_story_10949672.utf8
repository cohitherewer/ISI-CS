The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Talks to open film school
                                                                                                               Talks to open film school
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The chairman of the Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute, Buddhadeb Dasgupta, met the dean, director and the heads of the four departments on Monday afternoon to discuss the students grievances that had spurred an agitation on campus. The film school has been shut since April 2.         
	We discussed the opening of the institute and some academic issues. Students had a lot of grievances and we discussed those at length. The school will reopen shortly, after two or three things have been sorted out, said Dasgupta.        
	Twenty students, including five of the six who were suspended, stood outside the administration building, where the three-hour meeting was held, to stage a silent protest. The students who were served chargesheets last week have refused to admit the charges and are waiting for an inquiry commission to be set up.

	Kolkata Knight Riders have one worry less this IPL season  how to treat a nagging tennis elbow, a muscle pull or a tendon injury.        
	Jibak Mukherjee, the consultant physiotherapist for the city team, has imported a state-of-the art extra-corporeal shock wave therapy machine, that experts say can help musculo-skeletal injuries heal 25 to 30 per cent faster.        
	Elio Di Palma, a specialist in electro-physiotherapy, demonstrated the shock wave therapy procedure at Mukherjees clinic in south Calcutta on Monday.         
	The resident of Belgium, who is medical adviser to a Swiss firm manufacturing medical equipment, also held a workshop with a number of city-based physiotherapists, speaking about global trends in his field and sharing his experiences of working with football and basketball teams, athletes and even dancers.        
	The machine emits high and low-energy shock waves which help an injured muscle or soft tissue recover. Priced at Rs 21 lakh, this is said to be the third such machine in India. Delhis Army Hospital and the National Institute for the Orthopaedically Handicapped in Bonhooghly also have the machine.        
	Shock wave therapy is effective for pain management and shortening the recovery time after an injury, which is very important for sportspersons, Palma told Metro on the sidelines of his workshop. The healing process is much better and faster as the therapy improves blood flow and metabolism in the injured area.        
	Mukherjee pointed out that at times players hid their injuries so that they didnt have to sit out important matches. A high-end machine like this can be extremely helpful in such cases, he said.        
	He cited the example of East Bengal player Alvito DCunha, who was unable to play a few matches recently because of a foot injury. He underwent five sessions of shock wave therapy and was back on the field, said Mukherjee. Each session costs between Rs 1,000 and Rs 2,000 and a player, depending on the nature of injury, may require five-seven sessions.        
	Palma also spoke about injury prevention. One cannot completely rule out injuries on field or during practice. But certain precautionary steps go a long way in reducing the number and extent of injuries.         
	Does he have any tips for KKR boys before they set out for IPL2 on foreign shores? Yes, asserted Palma. Players often dont realise the importance of a good warm-up. A basic warm-up is usually not enough as it only heats up the skin and not the muscles. Stretching is very important. Players must also ensure they drink enough liquids to minimise chances of tendonitis.

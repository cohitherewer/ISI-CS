          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Panchami Jana, who allegedly dropped her eight-year-old son Sukumar while dangling him from the roof of a three-storeyed building to teach him a lesson, has confined herself to a room after Mondays fatal mishap.        
	Officers from Ultadanga police station visited her on Tuesday at her parents house in Patipukur, where she had moved with her husband Mahendra from their tiled-roof home between two railway quarters in the Dakshindari complex.        
	Panchami is too shocked to speak. She is overwhelmed by guilt and may have lost her mental balance, said an officer. The police have started a case of negligence against Panchami. We cannot arrest her as it was an accidental death. She is already suffering after losing her son, added the officer.        
	Mahendra told the officers that she had not come out of her room since Monday afternoon. He, too, is shattered and started crying as soon as he saw us. He told us that his dreams had been dashed with his sons death, said another officer.        
	According to witnesses and the police, Panchami lost her cool after seeing Sukumar, a student of Class III, playing with friends on the terrace. She did not approve of her son playing with some children from the locality and decided to teach him a lesson  with tragic consequences.

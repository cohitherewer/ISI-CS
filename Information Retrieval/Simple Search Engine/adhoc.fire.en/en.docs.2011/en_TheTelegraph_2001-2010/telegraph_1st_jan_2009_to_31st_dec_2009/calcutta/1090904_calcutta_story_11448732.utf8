The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Flier files bribery complaint
                                                                                                               Flier files bribery complaint
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A flier on Thursday lodged a complaint accusing a ground handling employee attached to Emirates of taking Rs 8,000 from him as bribe.        
	Rajiv De, an employee of a private agency hired by the Dubai-based airline, later returned the money and apologised in writing.        
	Saurav Sarkar, a student, had booked a ticket on a Calcutta-Dubai flight of Emirates which was scheduled to take off at 8.20pm. He was sitting in the security hold after completing formalities when De approached him and said he was carrying excess baggage.        
	De then asked Sarkar to accompany him to the toilet where he assured the flier of an easy passage provided he paid him Rs 8,000, said an officer of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF).        
	Sarkar paid him the money but later called up his parents who had come to see him off and narrated the incident to them. The parents got in touch with CISF officers, who launched a search for De.         
	After De was traced, Emirates officials at the airport started interrogating him. He admitted to taking the money and returned it to Sarkar, who then boarded the flight. He also tendered a written apology. Action will be taken against him, said an Emirates official.

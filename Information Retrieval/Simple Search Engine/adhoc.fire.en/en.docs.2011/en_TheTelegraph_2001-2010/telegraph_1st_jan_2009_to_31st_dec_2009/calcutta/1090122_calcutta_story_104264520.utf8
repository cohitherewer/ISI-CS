	 lsquo;We rsquo;ve never blinked rsquo;  Father Ponodath
  Rector, St. Xavier rsquo;s Collegiate School and College  I would like to express my deep gratitude to god for giving this institution the opportunity to serve so many people and the nation for a century and half. I would like to thank all the Fathers, teachers and students who have made this institution what it is. We have come a long way in our journey over these 150 years. When I look back, I feel proud of it.   Our founders have laid such a solid foundation that this institution has been able to withstand two World Wars and a lot of political upheavals in the country and the state and yet never slipped from the high standards it had set for itself. That is something marvellous and miraculous. In 150 years, this institution never blinked.  I feel proud to belong to the St. Xavier rsquo;s society and yet I feel very humble because I don rsquo;t measure up to all the great men who have been associated with it.   When I look forward, there is a great sense of hope because we have a very committed staff and dedicated alumni, which includes ex-students of both the school and college.   very time the old boys come back, I feel they have a sense of belonging. They like to visit the classrooms and corridors, looking for some reminiscence of those wonderful days spent here. Being an ex-student of the college, I share this feeling. Every time I visit room number 13, memories of my college days come back.  I feel that the institution should now reach out to new areas rather than basking in the glory of the past. I would like to insist on research. Not just academic research for the sake of getting degrees, but research on essential areas like peace, communal harmony and international understanding. We need to come up with results in these areas that will be of use to the people of the world. We are standing at a juncture where there is a lot to contribute to the nation and we must contribute like we have done in the past.              
	 lsquo;The core has to be kept in mind rsquo;  Father Jerome Francis
  Headmaster, St. Xavier rsquo;s Collegiate School  The 150th year of St. Xavier rsquo;s is a momentous occasion and we must run a check at this juncture to make sure we are still connected to our roots as we march forward with renewed zeal.   Xaverians have always been achievers in different fields. They have contributed to society by excelling in science, technology and the arts. But if you ask me, it is not this success that sets them apart. The exclusivity of the pupils of this school lies in their compassion and the human dimension of their personality.   Our boys have gone places, they have carved out niches for themselves on the biggest stages, competing with the best in the world. But they have not let success go to their head. They have retained their inherent simplicity. The challenge you face every day is how to retain that.   I have observed in my almost three years as the headmaster of St. Xavier rsquo;s Collegiate School Calcutta that the majority of the present crop of students being churned out by the school has the same mettle as their predecessors. I am sure this trend will continue.  The 150th year of the school is a time to celebrate. But it shouldn rsquo;t be about external decorations alone; I am sure Xaverians wouldn rsquo;t want it to be like that. These days, everything is too often only about the packaging. As long as the wrapper is catchy enough, we are not concerned with the gift inside. But the core has to be kept in mind and Xaverians do that, as ALSOC and its actions mdash; giving back to the alma mater and society mdash; exemplify.              
	 lsquo;We dream to be a university rsquo;  Father P.C. Mathew
  Principal, St. Xavier rsquo;s College  Completing150 years is a unique event in the history of an institution and I consider myself privileged to be at the helm of affairs of the college at this juncture. We the Jesuits of the present-day generation, the staff and students are grateful to the founders for their vision. The institution stands testimony to their noble vision and challenges today rsquo;s young generation to carry forward this tradition and heritage for a better world.   Times have changed and the institution has been responding to the changes with the spirit of Nihil Ultra, bringing in new ways in the field of higher education. The college now is making serious efforts to be involved in serious research and thus contribute to the building of a knowledge society, without which it cannot claim to be a higher educational institution in the true sense. The college already has four postgraduate departments mdash; MSc in computer science, in physics, and commerce, and a five-year integrated MSc course in biotechnology.   I am proud to state that in the recently held Indian Science Congress at Shillong, over 13 papers were approved and three were selected for oral presentation in front of the leading scientists of the country from among the papers submitted by undergraduate students of the Microbiology department in St. Xavier rsquo;s. Another creditable achievement is the recognition of the departments of physics and biotechnology as research centres by the Calcutta University.   St. Xavier rsquo;s College has also been recognised as a potential centre for excellence and is the first college to get autonomy in West Bengal. We are grateful for the encouragement we have received from the state government, particularly the chief minister Shri Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. Now our dream is to make this autonomous college into a university, for which we require land and infrastructure. We dearly hope that the dream will be realised in the next five to 10 years.   The college is grateful for the support it has received from the city and, above all, the alumni. Members of the Alumni Association operate with the spirit they have absorbed from the college and they try to repay their debt to their alma mater and the society at large. They have already undertaken the transformation of two villages mdash; Paikhala in South 24-Parganas and Dasghara in Hooghly district.               
	 lsquo;A teamwork over the years rsquo;  Father A. Huart
  Former rector of St. Xavier rsquo;s Collegiate School and College (1982-88)  The first thing that comes to mind about St. Xavier rsquo;s is the enormous goodwill and co-operation of the staff and the competitive spirit of the students.  During my time, it was a relatively small college and I used to know the name of every student of the arts and science departments. I worked under three principals and received tremendous co-operation from them as well as encouragement from eminent Fathers.  I remember the enthusiasm of the students as well as the old boys rsquo; and girls rsquo; association during the 125th year celebration held during my tenure as rector.   I remember the rsquo;60s and rsquo;70s when the whole city was in turmoil with the Naxalite movement but St. Xavier rsquo;s escaped from it entirely. There were some attempts in the rsquo;60s to bring in a college union based on politics but it met with resistance from the students who thought it would divide them.   St. Xavier rsquo;s is the collective work of Belgian Fathers who came to Calcutta in 1858. It has been a teamwork over the years and I am part of that team. The institution was a serious academic endeavour, which was also a great experience in fellowship. It was a mix of people from different backgrounds and faith.  My generation played a role in stabilising the institution, which was very important. But every institution needs expansion, experimentation and innovation, which is being done under the guidance of Fr P.C. Mathew.  In the 150th year of the institution, I would like to extend warm greetings to the new Xaverians and new St. Xavier rsquo;s.

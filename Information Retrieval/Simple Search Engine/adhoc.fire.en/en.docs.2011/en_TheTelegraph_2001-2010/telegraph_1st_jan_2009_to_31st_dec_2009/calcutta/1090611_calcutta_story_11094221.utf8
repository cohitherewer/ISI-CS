The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A lesson learnt from Sheetal landing
                                                                                                               A lesson learnt from Sheetal landing
  - Frequent fliers advised to be more careful about declaring valuables and paying duty          KARO CHRISTINE KUMAR                                                  
	Dont do a Sheetal Mafatlal, is the buzzword among frequent fliers in town.        
	The next time youre off on a holiday or attending a wedding on foreign shores, they are telling one another, declaring the valuables you are carrying or bringing back to the customs department can spare you the ordeal suffered by Mumbai socialite Sheetal on June 6.        
	We always advise our clients to declare the valuables that they are carrying so that the customs officer makes a note of it, and they are not charged any duty on the way back. For items bought abroad, it is prudent to pay duty because non-declaration can lead to arrest, says Anil Punjabi, the chairman (Eastern India Chapter) of Travel Agents Federation of India.        
	According to the current custom rules, if you have shopped abroad, jewellery, electronics and other items up to Rs 25,000 are duty-free. For anything beyond, duty must be paid, failing which fine and penalty can be imposed.         
	Better be safe than sorry, feels fashion designer Kiran Uttam Ghosh. Two years ago, I didnt pick up a python bag from Italy because I wasnt sure if it would have to go through customs, she says. I have often noticed that customs officials are quite reluctant to enter all the items but I insist that they do because I dont want to be in a tight spot later. Often, its difficult to say what jewellery is new and whats old.        
	Under Section 135 of the Customs Act for evasion of duty  that led to the Mafatlal bahus arrest at Mumbai airport  the offence can be compounded by paying up to 20 per cent of market value of the goods or Rs 10 lakh whichever is higher. This comes into play when the amount is more than Rs 5 lakh and proceedings have been initiated by the customs department. Otherwise, an out-of-court settlement can be reached.        
	A check list from the travel trade? Keep your valuables and all metal items in your hand baggage; do not leave hand baggage unattended; avoid unnecessary shopping for goods available in India; preserve all bills and customs receipts.

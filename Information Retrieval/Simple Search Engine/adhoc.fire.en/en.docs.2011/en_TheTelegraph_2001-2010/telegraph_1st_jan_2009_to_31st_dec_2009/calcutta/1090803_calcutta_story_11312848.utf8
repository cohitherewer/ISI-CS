The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Vehicle ban cripples services
                                                                                                               Vehicle ban cripples services
          OUR BUREAU                          Sixty per cent of fire tenders are off the road                                  
	The phase-out of commercial vehicles over 15 years of age has affected the functioning of government wings and the civic body. Metro focuses on how vital services have been hit by the administrations tardy response to the high court ban:         
	Fire services         
	Sixty per cent of the fire tenders in the city are over 15 years old and have been taken off the road. Hence, if there is a major fire in the city, the department will be hard-pressed to deploy enough tenders to tackle it.         
	If 20 engines are required in a fire, we are not in a position to send more than eight. If there are two major fires, we do not know what we will do, said Gopal Bhattacharjee, the director of West Bengal Fire and Emergency Services.         
	We have decided not to use fire engines that are more than 15 years old. We are not sure whether the high court ban covers fire tenders or not, he added.         
	According to sources in the department, the officers-in-charge of the fire stations are wary of being slapped with contempt cases if tenders sent out by them are found to be over 15 years old.         
	There are 103 fire stations, with an average of four tenders each.         
	The director general said he had written to fire minister Pratim Chatterjee almost 10 days before the July 31 deadline, reminding him to replace the old fire tenders but no steps have been taken.         
	The minister was not available for comment.         
	Civic services         
	At least 20,000 residents of Dhapa, Tangra, Beleghata, Kidderpore and Narkeldanga, who depend on the Calcutta Municipal Corporations tankers for water supply, have had to make other arrangements since the phase-out drive started on Saturday.         
	Reason: most of the 50 tankers  each with a capacity of 4,000 litres  that supply water in these areas are commercial vehicles over 15 years old.        
	According to civic sources, the owners had bought old tankers from the army.         
	The contractors have grounded almost all the water tankers fearing police action, said Bibhas Maity, the chief engineer (water supply) of the civic body.         
	The tankers also provide emergency supply in areas where water flow is disrupted.         
	Water supply has become irregular in many areas where treated water is not provided and ground water is unfit for drinking because of the phase-out drive, said CPM councillor Jayasree Deb Nandy.         
	At least half of the 70 civic trucks that ferry road repair materials have also gone off the road on account of age.         
	Policing         
	Calcutta police have also withdrawn vehicles that are over 15 years old. More than 25 vehicles of the wireless wing and a handful of prison vans have not made the cut.         
	Our services will not be affected because less than five per cent of our vehicles are over 15 years old. We have utilised a large chunk of the modernisation grant by the Centre to buy new vehicles, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of detective department.         
	About 40 lorries have been grounded. They are mostly used for movement of policemen. We havent faced a problem yet because we did not need to move personnel en masse, said an officer at Lalbazar.

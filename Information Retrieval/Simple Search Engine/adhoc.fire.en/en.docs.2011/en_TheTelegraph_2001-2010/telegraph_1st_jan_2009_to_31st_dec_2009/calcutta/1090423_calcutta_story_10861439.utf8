	Behala homemaker Suparna Mondal was murdered possibly because she backed out on her promise to pay Rs 7 lakh to a 22-year-old woman whom she had persuaded to abort her pregnancy, police said on Wednesday.        
	The cops have learnt that the woman, Shilpa Manna, had an affair with Suparnas brother Sudhin Mondal and threatened to spill the beans when his marriage was fixed with someone else.        
	Shilpa, arrested along with five others, was allegedly in the gang of four that had murdered the homemaker and tried to kill her younger son at their Satyajit Ray Sarani home on Tuesday afternoon.        
	The police said Suparna was smothered with a pillow and then hanged from the ceiling fan of her bedroom. The quartet also tried to smother nine-year-old Pratim, who witnessed his mothers murder, but he survived. They left him for dead after he passed out.        
	Apart from Shilpa, those arrested have been identified as Safinur Ali, 18, Khokon Laskar, 24, Akhtarul Shiekh, 24, Fazlur Sipahi, 18, and Sabir Ali Palwan, 26.        
	Sabir Ali was the mastermind and the jewellery the gang had looted from the Behala house  17 gold and silver items  was found in Fazlurs custody. The other three men had accompanied Shilpa to Suparnas home, said an investigating officer of Behala police station.        
	All six were picked up from Sirakol, in Diamond Harbour, following nightlong raids. The victims parental home is in the same locality. We have got some clues and are probing the case from all angles, said Ajey Ranade, the superintendent of South 24-Parganas police.         
	The accused have been charged under IPC sections 302 (murder), 396 (dacoity) and 120B (criminal conspiracy).        
	Shilpa said during interrogation that she had met Sudhin, 28, after joining his pen factory in Sirakol. The duo soon became intimate. We learnt from other sources that Shilpa had become pregnant around the time Sudhins marriage was fixed with another woman. When Shilpa threatened to blow the lid on her affair, Suparna persuaded her to undergo an abortion after promising her a hefty sum, said a police source.        
	Pratim told the sleuths that the gang was demanding Rs 7 lakh from his mother. We presume that was the amount the victim had promised Shilpa if she aborted the foetus. She apparently refused to pay after the procedure, the source added. The police will question Sudhin.        
	Sleuths said they were analysing some fingerprints collected from a few glasses and plates in the house. We are also trying to find out whether the victim had been drugged before being killed. The post-mortem report will answer several queries, said an investigating officer.        
	Sudhins elder brother Sukanto, who was detained on Tuesday after he turned up at the Behala house on being told about his sisters death, has been released. Neighbours took him to be one of the killers when they learnt he was from Sirakol and beat him up before handing him over to the police.

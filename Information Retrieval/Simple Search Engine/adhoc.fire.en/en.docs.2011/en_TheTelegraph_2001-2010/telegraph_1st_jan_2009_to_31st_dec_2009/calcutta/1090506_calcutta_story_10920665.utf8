The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Kidnap prods security beef-up at schools
                                                                                                               Kidnap prods security beef-up at schools
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Private schools in the city have decided to tighten security around the campuses following the abduction of a 10-year-old girl from in front of Welland Gouldsmith School in Bowbazar on Monday.        
	The schools, especially the girls-only institutions, decided on Monday to deploy additional security guards in front of the premises to keep an eye on the children in the morning and afternoon.        
	We will post an extra guard in front of our gate every morning and afternoon. The abduction of a 10-year-old student from near Welland Gouldsmith School is shocking. We have asked all our guards to keep vigil on the vehicles parked outside our premises in the morning and afternoon, said Basanti Biswas, the principal of Calcutta Girls School.        
	Biswas held a meeting with teachers and other employees of her school on Monday to discuss ways to tighten security on the campus as well as in the adjacent areas.        
	Explaining the reason for the deployment of additional guards, an official of another girls school said: There is too much of crowd and traffic in front of all big schools during rush hours and it is not possible for a guard or two to keep track on every child or car.        
	Gilian Rosemary Hart, the principal of Welland Gouldsmith School, said the managements would soon seek an appointment with the police brass to work out ways to ensure better security and smooth traffic movement around the institutions during rush hours.        
	The authorities of Welland Gouldsmith, Mahadevi Girls Higher Secondary, South Point, Birla High and Rammohan Mission have decided to meet guardians and urge them to be more careful before selecting pool cars for their wards.        
	The pool car attendants, especially those who ferry kids, should stay with the students till they enter the school compound. Since it is not possible for the school to control the pool car attendants, we will tell guardians to be cautious while engaging a pool car agency, said Malini Bhagat, the principal of Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School.        
	Some schools are also planning to approach the police to set up pickets near the gates when students enter and leave the premises.        
	The authorities of Welland Gouldsmith during the day spoke to the two students who were with the Class V girl moments before she was abducted by two men.        
	The versions did not match, said a source in the school.        
	The Class V student, a resident of Bangur Avenue, off VIP Road, was rescued from Howrah station by railway cops.         
	The duo who the girl said had abducted her could not be traced.

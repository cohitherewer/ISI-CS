                      Appreciation of life and world                    Every artist envisages the world around him in his own unique way, transcribing his impressions aesthetically through his chosen medium of expression. However, the ongoing show of paintings by Aloke Roy and Tandra Bera does more than just reflect their views on life. They are a celebration of life, with all its complexities and enigmas, division and discord. The paintings teach us how to appreciate and treasure life even in the midst of adversity. Bera uses bright vibrant colours like vermilion red in the background of vivid green and chrome yellow to evoke a sense of mirth and sublimity in the subconscious mind of the viewer. Her paintings carry the essence of Kathputli naach, the traditional puppet dance of Rajasthan. Roys canvases elevate the mundane world into the realm of artistic imagery. Through his colourful world of dreams, Roy tries to communicate his passion and vision about the various facades of life.                    lEvent: An exhibition of paintings by Aloke Roy and Tandra Bera lWhen: Till July 9; 3 pm - 8 pm lWhere: Chitrakoot Art Gallery, 55 Gariahat Road

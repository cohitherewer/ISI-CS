	Three youngsters from Bengal are among the 32 shortlisted from across the country who might make it to London to play the Arsenal way this summer. They are the winners of the Tata Tea Jaago Re Soccer Stars tournament.         
	The lucky 32, from 10 to 15 years of age, have been shortlisted from 16 teams that made it to the finals of the tournament. They were picked from 5,000 players from 460 schools in 10 cities. They fought it out on the football field for over five months.         
	The contest concluded with the final match on April 25 at the Howrah Municipal Corporation Stadium, where Basudevpur Pally Hitasadhani High School from Calcutta beat Boys Sports Company, Shillong, 4-3 in a tie breaker. Most of the teams at the tournament were school and club teams.         
	The players from Bengal include Souvik Das from Jonepur High School, Biswajit Sardar from Jatia High School and Biswajit Mullik from Basudebpur Palli Institution.        
	The selection process for the tournament involved more than 600 matches played between the shortlisted teams across the country from November last year.         
	The finalists are from cities like Bangalore, Calcutta, Mumbai, Goa and Delhi.         
	For the boys, the excitement has just begun. They will participate in a two-week camp in Calcutta in June, where they will be trained by coaches Paul Shipwright and Kurt Maginley from Arsenal International Soccer School, England. They will be taught to play by the rules of one of Englands leading football clubs. From the camp, 16 will be selected for the final team that will play at the Arsenal International Soccer Festival.         
	This is the second time that children are going for the soccer festival. Last year, our team won the Plate Cup, the first team from India to do so, said an organiser.         
	Said ex- footballer Jamshed Nasiri, the key coach of the tournament and one of the judges: It will be a great learning experience for the boys. They will find the programme immensely valuable as they will be acquainted with the techniques of the game from master coaches.

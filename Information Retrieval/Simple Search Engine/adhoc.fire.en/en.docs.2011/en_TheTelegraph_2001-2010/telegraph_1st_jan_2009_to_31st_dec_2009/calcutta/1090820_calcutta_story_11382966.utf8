The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Move to legalise PhD admissions 
                                                                                                               Move to legalise PhD admissions 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The higher education council on Wednesday directed state universities to find ways to legalise the registrations of PhD candidates enrolled under old regulations.        
	The University Grants Commission (UGC) issued a gazette notification on the new PhD norms on July 11. All subsequent PhD registrations should have been done under the new regulations.        
	Since there was no official intimation from the UGC on July 11 notification, it appears that Calcutta University and other universities continued to enrol students for doctoral programmes under old regulations till August 10, said council chairman Subimal Sen.        
	The universities stopped PhD registrations under old norms on August 10 after the UGC uploaded the new regulations on its website.         
	According to sources, about 300 PhD candidates were enrolled with the state universities between July 11 and August 10.        
	Each candidate registered for PhD after July 11 should be given an opportunity to pursue doctoral studies, said Sen.        
	The universities have been asked to prepare a report on how they would legalise registrations made after July 11 and submit it to the council.         
	Under the new rules, candidates can be enrolled for PhD only after an entrance test and interview. They will also have to attend classes.        
	The council also decided on Wednesday that the recent UGC decision making it mandatory for PhD and MPhil degree holders to clear NET or SLET to apply for teaching posts in colleges will not bear upon those who applied for lectureship last December.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Howrah hit by wheel strike
                                                                                                               Howrah hit by wheel strike
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The entire fleet of around 400 buses and minibuses plying within Howrah was taken off the road on Friday to protest the drive against resoled tyres, providing commuters on this side of the river a glimpse of what could lie ahead once the promised crackdown on old commercial vehicles starts.        
	Only buses that terminated at Howrah station or Mandirtala in Shibpur, off Vidyasagar Setu, were exempt from the strike.        
	Transporters at a meeting with the district administration refused to replace the resoled tyres  responsible for many fatal accidents  on the ground that 80 per cent of the vehicles in the district would have to be benched by July 31 as they were more than 15 years old.        
	A few buses rolled out in the morning but as soon as word spread that transport inspectors were penalising vehicles using resoled tyres, the transporters decided to slam the brakes.        
	Any attempt to enforce the law has met with the same response  transporters holding the people to ransom, said Deborshi Chakraborty, walking from Howrah Maidan to Howrah station to catch a bus.        
	An eight-member team of the Howrah District Bus and Minibus Syndicate met additional district magistrate Supriya Rangarajan and mayor Mamata Jaiswal separately. Both requested the syndicate leaders to resume service but their plea was turned down.        
	Syndicate president Nikhilesh Mukherjee said: We requested the additional district magistrate not to fine buses using resoled tyres as most of the vehicles, being more than 15 years old, would have to be taken off the road by July 31 in compliance with a high court order. She assured us that the drive would be suspended till July 31.        
	Rangarajan denied having told the transporters that the drive would be stopped till July 31. There is no question of suspending the raid.        
	Regional Transport Officer Kalyan Mukherjee said a government notification issued in 2008 had stipulated that the front tyres and the two rear tyres on the outer side could not be resoled.        
	A probe has revealed that one of the front tyres of the minibus that tumbled off Bankim Setu last Saturday and fell onto the railway tracks below, killing 12 people, were resoled.

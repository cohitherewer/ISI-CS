The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Steal and sell fuel from Writers parking lot
                                                                                                               Steal and sell fuel from Writers parking lot
          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                                                    
	Two men in their late-20s take out two 5litre jerrycans each from the boot of a taxi parked near the Dalhousie bus stand, about 200m from Writers Buildings. They approach a bearded man, who accompanies them to the garage off Laldighi where government cars, including those of ministers, are parked. Three men emerge from a government car (WML 9777) with a pipe. After a quick word with the two men, they insert the pipe into the vehicles fuel tank and fill up the cans. The duo pay one of the three men, shake hands and walk back to the taxi.              
	Drivers of government cars parked in the garage opposite Writers Buildings are stealing fuel from the vehicles and selling them at a discount.        
	On weekdays, about 200 government cars are parked near Laldighi. According to sources, petrol and diesel are funnelled out of at least 60 per cent of the cars. If 2 litres of fuel are siphoned off from a car daily, the amount of fuel stolen every day is more than 200 litres, which cost about Rs 6,600. The money involved in the racket is estimated at over Rs 1.5 lakh per month.        
	Metro visited the parking lot on a Monday afternoon and found drivers, along with some unemployed youths, siphoning fuel out of vehicles with pipes. The stolen fuel was being sold to customers carrying jerrycans.        
	Yahan kafi sasta tel milta hai. Purey Calcutta mein itna sasta nahi milega (One can get diesel/petrol at cheap rate here), said a driver of a private company with an office nearby.        
	Diesel is sold at Rs 20 per litre and petrol at Rs 25 per litre in the parking lot, against the current market rates of Rs 32.8 and Rs 44.5, respectively.        
	A row of cars including white ambassadors fitted with beacons line up on both sides of the garage. Armed with pipes, drivers were seen sitting inside the vehicle and waiting for customers to make the killing.        
	Seeing a youth enter the garage carrying a jerrycan, the driver of a beacon-fitted car (WMC 1635) inserted the pipe into the oil tank.         
	Those who want to buy stolen oil visit the parking lot with containers on weekdays. Monday and Friday are the busiest days for the racketeers.        
	The buyers are mainly unemployed youths. Policemen know about the racket but turn a blind eye to it, said a taxi driver who buys stolen fuel.        
	According to him, katatel dealers also source diesel and petrol from the racket.         
	R.K. Maity, the joint secretary in the transport department, said 80 to 90 per cent of the cars parked near Laldighi were owned by the government and the rest hired by departments.        
	I will order an investigation if you come up with specific reports. Corruption is everywhere and we have to crack down whenever we notice any malpractice. We need to check whether people in charge of monitoring oil consumption check the mileage, he said.        
	Maitys department buys fuel from IOC with taxpayers money and makes it available to government cars.        
	Each government vehicle is allotted 10-25 litres of fuel on weekdays but employees of the petrol pump in Bhowanipore that supplies the fuel provide them petrol and diesel over the stipulated amount, said a transport department official. They also get a cut of the stolen fuel, he said.        
	A driver of the public works department said the racket had been in operation since last year after the parking lot was shifted to its current location because of construction of the underground parking plaza in Laldighi.        
	The drivers of some ministers are involved in the racket. We dont want to land in trouble by blowing the whistle, said a sergeant of headquarters traffic guard, which is responsible for traffic management in the area.

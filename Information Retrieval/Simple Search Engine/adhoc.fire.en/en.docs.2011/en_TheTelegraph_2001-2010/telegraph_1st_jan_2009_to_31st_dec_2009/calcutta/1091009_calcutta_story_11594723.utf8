The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Classic over trendy
                                                                                                                 We Ask You Answer      Classic over trendy
          Which of these forms of the goddess do you want to see more of in Puja 2010?

	 I would prefer to stick to the classic and traditional look of Ma Durga. We, pandal-hoppers, do move from one pandal to another to search of novelty in theme. But playing around with the idols according to the theme is not always appealing, even though it may draw cheap plaudits. I feel that the puja committee can work towards innovative concepts but preserve the traditional look as far as the idols are concerned.

	I want to see the trendy face of the Devi in Durga puja 2010.

	For me, 2010 should come with a modern avatar of Devi. When the whole world is going through a revolution, let Ma also go through changes in look. That way wonders from across the globe can be made available before our eyes without burning a hole in our pockets.

	Id prefer the traditional ekchala form of the goddess in Puja 2010. Nowadays, Durga puja has became commercialised and done with the motive of winning prizes. People too need to remember that they visit a pandal to see the goddess and not just the pandal.              
	

M.N. Banerjee,
  Jodhpur Park        
	Let the classic face of the Devi return next year. The real challenge for puja organisers lies in drawing crowds by doing minimal alterations possible to the idol.

	The classic form of Durga is my choice for Puja 2010.

	My vote would go for the traditional look of the goddess. One does not tamper with the look of one rsquo;s Mother. I have nothing against theme-based pujas. One may experiment as much as one likes with the pandal but the idol should not be touched. I was quite upset this year on seeing an idol with hair parted at a side.     
	Next week  
	Who do you blame for Eden Gardens not getting to host international matches for so long?

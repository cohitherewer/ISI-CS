The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Youth thrashed for soiling hospital bed
                                                                                                               Youth thrashed for soiling hospital bed
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A youth, too weak to walk without a helping hand, was severely beaten up by four Group D employees of Medical College and Hospital after he soiled his bed on Sunday night.        
	Family members of Manoj Kumar Singh, who has been suffering from Hepatitis B and other ailments for the past year, said the 26-year-old defecated after the staff members in the medicine ward ignored his repeated pleas to help him to the toilet.        
	Rajendra Kumar, the youths cousin, alleged that the ward master on duty had ordered him out of the room when he went to lodge a complaint on Monday. A complaint was later filed with Bowbazar police station, following which Srikanta Dolui and Ranjan Ray were arrested. A search is on for two others.        
	Dolui and Ray  hired from a private agency  have been booked under IPC sections 323 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt) and 341 (wrongful restraint), both bailable.        
	Section 323 carries a punishment of a year in jail or a fine of Rs 1,000, or both; Section 341, a months simple imprisonment or a fine of Rs 500, or both.        
	Manoj, a resident of Howrahs Gopal Chand Mukherjee Lane, was admitted to the medicine ward of the hospital 12 days ago with Hepatitis B, fever and other complications.        
	The ailments have left him so weak that he cannot get out of bed without support, said Rajendra.        
	Late on Sunday, Manoj requested the ward boys to help him go to the toilet. He pleaded with them for more than half an hour but no one came forward. To make matters worse, not a single nurse could be seen anywhere in the ward, recalled a patient who did not want to be named.        
	Manoj then soiled the bed and was lying there for quite some time. When some Group D employees saw this, four of them beat him up mercilessly. They hit him everywhere, said Rajendra.        
	The other patients said they did not dare intervene despite Manojs repeated cries for help.        
	When Rajendra turned up in the morning, Manoj was still bleeding from his lips and his face was swollen. He cried out on seeing me and pleaded with me to take him away. He was so traumatised that he could not eat in the morning, recounted Rajendra.        
	A probe will be conducted. The two accused employees will never be allowed to enter the hospital, said superintendent Anup Roy.         
	This brutal act at Medical College comes a day after a patient went missing from SSKM Hospital because of a Group D employees negligence.

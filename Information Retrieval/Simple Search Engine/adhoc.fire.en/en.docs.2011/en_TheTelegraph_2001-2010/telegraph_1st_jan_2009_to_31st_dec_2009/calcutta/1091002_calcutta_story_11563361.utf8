The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Smoke alarm in weary Metro
                                                                                                               Smoke alarm in weary Metro
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The Metro Rail mess, which marred the opening of the extended route on August 23, continues to haunt passengers more than a month later.        
	On Thursday afternoon, many passengers jumped out of a Garia Bazar (Kavi Nazrul)-bound train at Girish Park station after black smoke billowed out from under the rake and enveloped the rear coaches.        
	Metro sources blamed poor upkeep  a result of the shortage of rakes following the extension of the route  for the incident.        
	The train was at Girish Park station at 1.34pm when commuters spotted black smoke under the fourth coach from the rear.        
	I saw the driver jump out of his cabin and run towards the other end of the train with a fire extinguisher, said a passenger in the first compartment. We immediately got off the train and saw the rear coaches covered in thick black smoke. Several passengers ran towards the exit, he added.        
	Commuters said the power supply was snapped and only the emergency lights were on. The train floor became very hot. We were scared but there was no announcement from the Metro authorities about what was happening, said a witness.        
	A Metro spokesperson said there was no fire and that the smoke was brought under control within a few minutes by the employees.        
	The cause of the smoke is yet to be ascertained. The passengers were evacuated at Girish Park and the train was taken to the maintenance yard, the official claimed.        
	But some commuters as well as Metro sources who did not want to be named said the train was run till Rabindra Sadan station before it was withdrawn from operation.        
	The train left Girish Park after around 15 minutes but I could hear the driver tell someone that the doors of the affected coach could not be closed, said the passenger in the first coach.        
	Three Garia Bazar-bound trains were delayed by around 10 minutes because of the incident.        
	Asked about the reason for the poor upkeep that might have caused the emission of smoke, a Metro official said: Earlier, we used to run 12 out of the 18 rakes. Following the inauguration of the extended route without any increase in the number of trains, we are being forced to deploy all but one of the rakes. This is hampering maintenance work.         
	Youth manhandled: Some passengers manhandled a 22-year-old mentally-challenged youth on a Dum Dum-bound Metro after they mistook the toy gun he was carrying for a real weapon. Balai Sarkar was handed over to the Railway Protection Force at Central station around 1pm. A team from Bowbazar police station later took him away.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Block it, shut it, forget it
                                                                                                               Block it, shut it, forget it

	The Metro channel has gone from being the first refuge of the leader looking for a ready audience to the last refuge of anyone with a speech, a skit or a song.        
	A 72-hour demonstration against price rise by the Howrah unit of the Left Front since Wednesday morning has not only clogged the channel and choked the heart of the city during the day but also robbed residents of their sleep through the night.        
	Mamata Banerjees 26-day sit-in against land acquisition in Nandigram and Singur had badly affected us but at least we could sleep in peace. But these protesters are out to make life miserable for us even at night. They were shouting, singing and acting all night, complained a resident of the historical Metropolitan Building, opposite the Metro channel.        
	If a handful of protesters could paralyse the city centre during the day and pulverise residents at night, Friday holds out the threat of greater misery with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Left Front chairman Biman Bose set to play traffic-stoppers.        
	On Wednesday and Thursday, traffic on CR Avenue, SN Banerjee Road and JL Nehru Road barely moved during the morning and late-afternoon rush hours because of the Metro channel mess. Another Left Front affiliate, the Calcutta Basti Federation, added to the chaos by occupying one flank of Rani Rashmoni Road for 12 hours on Thursday, starting 9am.         
	This is the fourth time in two days that I am stuck at this crossing, said Ajanta Ghosh, a bank employee stranded in a taxi at the Dorina crossing near the central bus terminus.         
	Why dont they ban this Metro channel menace once and for all? But who will do it? wondered the resident of Rashbehari Avenue.        
	Political parties had moved to Rani Rashmoni Avenue  the Red Road approach from the SN Banerjee Road-Jawaharlal Nehru Road crossing  after a high court directive in June 1996 banning large gatherings from the KC Das crossing to the Raj Bhavan (east) gate. But once the thoroughfare opposite Metro cinema was widened, the Metro channel became the prime target for protesters.        
	An officer at Hare Street police station said the process of seeking permission for a traffic-stopper meet at Metro channel was an informal one. It is more about informing the police about the rally rather than seeing permission. Lalbazar and the local police station are informed about the event, and that is it.         
	As Thursday evening approached, the speeches turned into songs and skits. Behind the 10ftx20ft stage was more food for thought  an elaborate buffet spread for the protesters against price rise.        
	A few people come here to raise slogans, sing and eat in the name of protesting, and inconvenience so many citizens. Why are they allowed to get away with it? demanded a commuter caught at the clogged crossroads.        
	Should protests be allowed at Metro channel? ttmetroabpmail.com

                      Corporate Indias global march                    When Indian auto manufacturer Tata Motors bought the iconic Jaguar and Land Rover brands, it opened up a new chapter in Indias economic story. In the coming years, Indian multinationals Bharat Forge, Hindalco, Infosys, Mahindra and Suzlon will increasingly be making acquisitions and building their brands in Western markets. Nirmalya Kumars Indias Global Powerhouses: How They Are Taking On the World introduces the reader to Indias pre-eminent global companies and explains how they differ from their international rivals. The book profiles the countrys pioneering multinationals in detail, describing their transformation from leading domestic players to evolving global giants, as well as their unique approaches to globalisation. The book attempts to broaden the perspective of Indian commerce from a shortcut based approach to a globally sustainable management competency policy. It profiles top Indian enterprises with truly global operations and how they have scripted a global success story. Making an assessment about Indias market potential in different industrial fields, it also conveniently positions the possibilities of working in the countrys vast and ever-expanding domestic market. This evening, Chairman Emeritus of the RPG Group, R.P. Goenka, will launch the book. Also, a panel discussion on Indias Globalisation- what lies ahead. Panelists: Nirmalya Kumar, Pradipta K Mohapatra (co-author) and R.P. Goenka.                  lEvent: Launch of Nirmalya Kumars book Indias Global Powerhouses lWhen: Today at 6 pm lWhere: Oxford Bookstore, Park Street

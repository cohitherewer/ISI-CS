The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mob fury at hospital after death
                                                                                                               Mob fury at hospital after death
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	About 150 relatives and neighbours of a patient at RG Kar hospital went on the rampage after she died on Monday morning, allegedly because of negligence.        
	Purnima Singh, a 45-year-old Maniktala resident, visited the outpatients department of the hospital on Sunday morning with severe stomach pain. She admitted herself to the emergency ward on the advice of doctors.         
	The homemaker died around 8am following a five-hour operation at night.        
	Her relatives, neighbours and members of a local club broke the gate of the hospitals administrative building and its window panes and scuffled with employees and policemen.         
	Bittu, Purnimas 23-year-old son, said: My mother had been complaining of stomach ache for two weeks. On Sunday, doctors said she would have to be operated on for appendicitis and the surgery would not take more than half an hour.        
	Purnima was wheeled into an operating theatre around 1am, after her condition worsened. The surgery continued till 6am. Nobody told us what was going on. After emerging from the operating theatre, the doctor said he had found a cyst in her stomach and she was fine. But when I went to her bed, she was in a bad state, added Bittu.        
	The family members alleged the oxygen mask provided to Purnima was removed around 7am. When I asked a nurse about the oxygen mask, she asked us to leave, said Pankaj Sarkar, a neighbour of the family.        
	The superintendent of RG Kar hospital, S.K. Banerjee, said the family members were given an option of getting a post-mortem done to establish the cause of death but they did not agree. But since there has been an allegation of negligence, we will inquire into the incident, added Banerjee.        
	The family later lodged a complaint against the hospital with Tallah police station.        
	Why didnt the doctors inform us when they discovered a cyst in my mothers stomach? Why did they operate on her without our consent and how did her condition worsen like this? We want the hospital authorities admit to their negligence in writing, said Purnimas son Raju.

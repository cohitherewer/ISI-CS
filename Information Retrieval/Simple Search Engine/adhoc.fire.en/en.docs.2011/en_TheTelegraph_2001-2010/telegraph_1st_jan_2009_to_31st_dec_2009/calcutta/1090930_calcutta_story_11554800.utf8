The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Deadline for idol immersion
                                                                                                               Deadline for idol immersion

	Puja organisers who do not immerse their idols by Wednesday could find it difficult to hold puja next year.         
	Joint commissioner (headquarters) Jawed Shamim said this on Tuesday while announcing immersion measures. He did not elaborate on the measures that might be taken against organisers who violate the deadline.         
	About 400 puja organisers will immerse their idols on Wednesday. Traffic may be diverted from roads along the Hooghly to prevent congestion, said Shamim.        
	Over 2,100 idols from Calcutta and its fringes were immersed in the Hooghly on Monday.        
	The challenge would be to tackle the immersion of over 400 idols on Wednesday, said a police officer.        
	The cops barricaded the ghats and are directing organisers to dump flowers and other puja accessories in enclosures beside the ghats.        
	We are not allowing anyone except those carrying the idols to reach the water to prevent mishaps. Personnel from river traffic police and the disaster management group are also manning the ghats, said an officer of Calcutta police.

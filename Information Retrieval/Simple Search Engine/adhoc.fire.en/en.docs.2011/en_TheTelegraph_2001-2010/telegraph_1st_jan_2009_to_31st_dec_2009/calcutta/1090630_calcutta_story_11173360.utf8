The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Medical help at night
                                                                                                               Medical help at night

	Little Ujan was throwing up violently in the middle of the night, and his parents, back home in Barasat for a short break from New Zealand, were at their wits end.        
	He was dehydrated and a ghastly pallor had set in, recalls Ujans grandfather Pratim Biswas, who dialled the Nightline number (25843636/ 25622280) in desperation.        
	The sexagenarian had only recently subscribed to the Nightline card, which provides his family access to night-time emergency healthcare services provided by Kalpataru Hospital in Barasat.        
	They sent a doctor with an ambulance. The doctor treated my one-year-old grandson for food-poisoning and dehydration. After the vomiting stopped, the doctor stayed back for an hour to be sure there wont be a recurrence, says Biswas.        
	The Nightline card scheme fills a void in emergency medical care at night for the community by providing doctor and medicines, carrying out basic investigations at home and enabling life-saving treatment to commence at home, before transfer to hospital, explains Satadal Saha, the managing director of Jubilant First Trust Healthcare Ltd which runs Kalpataru Hospital.         
	Once a call is received, depending on the severity of the problem, the doctor advises the card-member on the phone. When considered necessary, the doctor visits the members residence along with the Nightline ambulance and the patient is treated at home. If the situation is deemed critical, hospitalisation is advised.        
	The annual membership fee for the family card is Rs 180. The services are now offered only in the Barasat municipal area but Jubilant First Trust aims to reach out to the rest of the city soon, through its upcoming facilities in Madhyamgram and Bhowanipore.

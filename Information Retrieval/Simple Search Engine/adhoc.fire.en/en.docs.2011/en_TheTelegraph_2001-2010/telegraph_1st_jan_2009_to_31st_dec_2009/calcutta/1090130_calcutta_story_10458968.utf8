The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fair fire permit 
                                                                                                               Fair fire permit 
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The Book Fair, inaugurated on January 27, is being held without the mandatory no-objection certificate from the fire department.        
	Sources said the certificate could not be issued on Thursday as fire department officials raised questions on some safety measures on the ground. A few issues need to be addressed before we can issue the clearance. We have scanned the fair site and asked the Publishers and Booksellers Guild to take certain steps, said Uday Adhikari, a divisional officer in the fire department. We will review the situation on Friday.        
	Fire officials, while expressing satisfaction over water-supply arrangements on the ground, pointed out that there were not enough fire tenders in the stalls. We are considering offering a provisional no-objection certificate after the criteria are met, said an official. We will do the needful, said guild secretary Tridib Chattopadhayay.

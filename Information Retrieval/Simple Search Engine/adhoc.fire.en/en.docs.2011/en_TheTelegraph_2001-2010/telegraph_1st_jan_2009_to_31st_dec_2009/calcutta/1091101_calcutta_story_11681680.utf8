The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Poll pitch from Subhas shadow
                                                                                                               Poll pitch from Subhas shadow

	Subhas Chakraborty lives. Thousands may have bid him a tearful farewell on August 3 but his house at FD 144 in Salt Lake has turned into a shrine to the maverick minister who famously said he could do everything except bring the dead back to life.        
	Its easy to make out the two-storeyed house from a distance. The faade is almost wrapped in two blow-ups of the smiling face, along with quotes from Tagore  Tomar potaka jarey dao tarey bohibare dao shakati (He to whom you hand over your banner, give him the strength to carry it).         
	He had made the wish at his mentor Jyoti Basus last birthday, fuelling speculation as to whether he thinks himself to be the sole upholder of the Communist leaders legacy. More pictures escort a visitor indoors where one is greeted by another giant smiling face bedecked with flowers.        
	The boys who swore by Subhasda may have thinned in number but those present are no less active. The seat left vacant by his death is up for re-election next Saturday and it is his wife Ramola to whom the party has turned to retain that he had won seven times in a row.        
	Ramola is no Rabri Devi. Her political credentials are sound. The two children of refugee families from across the border had met and married on the sidelines of student politics. Yet, propelled to the hot seat, caught up in the whirlwind of election campaign, she feels the difference in her bones (harey harey bujhchhi). After six hours on the road she has had barely two hours to rest, before which the campaign caravan starts rolling again.         
	Rubbing her eyes, she comes down from the first floor in a white taant sari, which is not as trademarkedly plain as Mamata Banerjees. The engine of the SUV outside is already revving but she has to attend to cadres seeking clarifications or instructions first. Several are women as Ramola is part of the CPMs womens wing. So many of them had wept disconsolately alongside Subhasdas cortege. Today, they are fighting for Ramoladi.        
	The party has given me responsibility. So I am waving and smiling at people though the tears may flow within, says the 64-year-old. But she makes no bones about her biggest calling card being Subhas Chakrabortys wife. The identity is splashed across hoardings too, reminding people how the leader stayed beside them through Id, Puja and Diwali. The Election Commission is removing some of them after the Opposition complained.        
	The rival candidate is a sore point. Sujit Bose was Chakrabortys follower before he changed colour. He was one of innumerable youths who joined politics inspired by Subhasda. Kintu Shib gortey giye du-chartey bandor-o hobe na taki hoy (Can it be that a few monkeys will not get made while modelling gods)? she asks dismissively.        
	Where are the rest who walked in his last journey? Ramola has no blinkers on. Elections are not held on sentiments. Of course, people remember him, kintu abegey tolomolo hoye vote diye debe, ta hoy na (but it cannot be that they will get overwhelmed with emotion and cast their votes).        
	Yet, even in life after death, Subhas is fighting the election, one more time  against Maoists and Mamata, and for his own legacy.                     SUDESHNA BANERJEE

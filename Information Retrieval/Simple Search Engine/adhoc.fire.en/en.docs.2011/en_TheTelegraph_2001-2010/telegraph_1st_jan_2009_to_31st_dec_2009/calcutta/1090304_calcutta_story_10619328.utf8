           End of an era: Tapan Sinha                             
	It is unthinkable that a commission established to protect human rights has become non-functional as it has fallen short of the required number of members. (Rights panel in limbo, January 15).           
	The Human Rights Commission is an important agency for society. Many people are denied of their basic rights by various authorities. Such people can approach the commission for redress and expect to get justice.           
	Under the Human Rights Act, at least three members are required to make the commission functional. In the light of such a provision, it would be helpful if a list of persons eligible to serve in the commission is prepared.           
	Vacancies is such important bodies need to be filled up promptly so that people dont suffer.           
	Justice delayed is often justice denied. This is not justifiable under any circumstances.           
	For the sake of justice, the commission should remain functional always.

	West Bengal cuts a sorry figure when the world sees our leaders reduce the last journey of an eminent filmmaker like Tapan Sinha to a political farce (Mamata directs last ride, January 16). This was not expected of Mamata Banerjee. It would have been enough to show respect by placing a wreath on the mortal remains of the doyen.             
	Rather, she turned the sombre ambience into a political exhibition by showing the mourners development work carried out by her party at the Keoratala crematorium, which falls within her constituency. It is not only an insult to the great soul but also to the supporters whose mandate she enjoys.           
	Vote-bank politics has blindfolded her in such a manner that she is damaging her political fortunes. Poet Mamata Banerjee should read the poem Ulanga Raja by Shakti Chattopadhyay to realise her blunder.

	Mamata Banerjee seems to have hijacked Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees culturebazi. Subhas Mukhopadhyay, Paritosh Sen, Nanoand now Tapan Sinha  she is firmly in control of every celebritys funeral procession. The information and cultural affairs secretary is right that it is not mandatory for the chief minister to attend every occasion. But neither is it mandatory for a government to host film festivals when it cannot control polluting autos.           
	It seems that after Nano and Nandigram, Book Fair ban on the Maidan and Lalgarh, the culture crown is slipping out of the chief ministers grasp.

	The obituary on Tapan Sinha carried the heading A simple storyteller, January 16. I feel this description is not apt as it gives the impression that Sinha didnt rise above telling stories well. Though storytelling was one of his strengths, his greatness lay elsewhere. As the writer of the article has mentioned, he dealt with basic human emotions and touched a chord in many. Moreover, his films bear eloquent testimony to his artistic treatment and attention to detail. His films have stood the test of time. It is gross injustice to brand such a filmmaker as a mere storyteller.

	Tapan Sinhas demise marks the end of an era. Most of his films were in Bengali, but his fame transcended the barriers of culture, country and continent. But the master filmmakers first directorial venture, Ankush (1954) didnt do too well at the box office, though his narrative style received critical acclaim. Then he started making films based on Bengali literature  Kabuliwala, Louho Kopat, Kshudito Pashan, Hansuli Baanker Upokatha, Nirjan Saikatey and many more. The film industry has a fascination for big stars but Sinha was able to break the stereotype. In Golpo Holeo Shotyi (1966) the protagonist was brilliantly played by Rabi Ghosh, a relatively unknown actor till then. His films not only had an aesthetic sense but also the capability of providing box office dividends.

	Tapan Sinha came into prominence with his sublime Kabuliwala, in 1956. Sinha won 19 National Film Awards and his work competed at international film festivals. Later in life, he often spoke of the degeneration of Bengali cinema and lamented the dearth of good scripts. His demise is a huge loss.

	It was a pleasure to see the ever-fighting Mamata Banerjee sing on the stage of a reality show at City Centre. The event will certainly boost Didis sagging image after the Nano debacle.

	Apropos the report Bindra to Bagan, with tips for mind amp; muscle, January 17, I was thrilled to learn that our Ranaghat boy Amit Bhattacharya has been Abhinav Bindras mental conditioning coach for the past 13 years. But I feel Bindra should have received a grander reception in the city, like soccer legend Maradona did.

	Owing to a technical snag, the Cineplex area in Mani Square was facing inadequate cooling from February 18, noon. The problem was attended to on a war- footing and normal operations resumed on the evening of February 20. The Cineplex area in Mani Square has been sold to Aerens R of New Delhi, which holds the licence for screening films in IMAX theatres in the NCR and eastern India. We do not have any rental arrangement for Cineplex in Mani Square as against what has been reported in your newspaper on February 20 and 21.

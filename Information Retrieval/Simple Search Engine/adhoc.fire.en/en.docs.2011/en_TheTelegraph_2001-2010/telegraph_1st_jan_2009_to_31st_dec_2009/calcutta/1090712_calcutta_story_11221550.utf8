The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A tribute at last
                                                                                                               A tribute at last
                              Badal Sircar                            
	Four decades have passed since his path-breaking experiment to extend the experience of theatre and set it free from all limitation. Badal Sircar and his Third Theatre may be familiar to theatre lovers, but Calcutta is still only dully conscious of the man. Reticent and even intimidating to some, Sircar is now largely confined by illness to his second floor apartment at No. 1 Peary Row, though he still takes an active interest in the monthly theatre shows at the Loreto School in Sealdah by his old group Satabdi and the newer offshoots Pathasena and Aina.         
	Pune and Chennai honoured him in 2004 and 2005 and the National School of Drama felicitated him in 2009, but nothing significant has been done in his hometown. To make up for this omission, a five-day programme (July 15-19) is being organised by the Natya Shodh Sansthan in Salt Lake. It holds a large collection of archival material and documentation on Indian theatre.        
	There will be an exhibition on Sircar and his works where photographs of productions by Satabdi and other groups will be on display. Original playscripts that Sircar had gifted to Natya Shodh, founded in 1981, will be on view. Many like Beej, Oiroth, Bioscope, Churno Prithibi, Bhul Raasta and Bogola Charitmanas havent even been published. Also to be opened to the public will be video and audio recordings of productions by Satabdi.         
	We want to showcase his works and also all the work done on him. The Badal Utsav has been planned on a national scale. Among the guests will be Satydev Dubey, Amol Palekar, Girish Karnad and a host of theatre personalities from the city, said Pratibha Agarwal, the director of Natya Shodh.         
	Girish Karnad was the first to translate Badal Sircars Ebong Indrajit into English and Amol Palekar recently directed his favourite Sircar play Pagla Ghora. A selection of Sircars plays will be staged at the Natya Shodh Natya Bhavan. His group Satabdi will present the black comedy Khat Mat Kring on July 15, 7pm. Anamika has after a long gap produced Natyakar Ki Khoj Mein Teen Charitra (Hindi), to be directed by Bimal Lath on July 15, 6pm, while the Guwahati group Seagull will perform Hattamalar Sipare in Assamese the following day. On July 17 one can catch Pathasenas version of Tagores Raktakarabi directed by Sircar, while Aina will stage an early Sircar play Baagh, an adaptation of The Tiger by Murray Schisgal.         
	Though ailing, Sircar is looking forward to attending the July 15 event.                     SEBANTI SARKAR

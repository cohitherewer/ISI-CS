The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cops ignore goon assault
                                                                                                               Cops ignore goon assault
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Satya Charan Ghosh and his wife. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                  
	A gang has been threatening a 95-year-old resident of Ahiritola and his family to vacate their rented house but the local police are allegedly not taking any action.        
	The threats that have been continuing over the past five months peaked on Saturday evening when eight youths, one of them brandishing a revolver, barged into the Sen Lane house and asked Satya Charan Ghosh to leave by next month.        
	Ghosh, who alleged that the landlords were behind the threats, said the gang was led by brothers Sandip and Pintu Guin. Sandip pressed the revolver against my neck and threatened to kill me if we did not move out by May, he added.        
	Repeated pleas to Jorabagan police station fell on deaf ears. The officers even refused to register a complaint. It was only after Saturdays event that we could lodge a diary, said the nonagenarian.        
	The family has also approached Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of the detective department, who has asked the anti-rowdy squad to probe the case. Officers of the department admitted that the local police did not take any action. A case should have been started immediately.... Instead, the local cops tried to portray the incident as a landlord-tenant dispute, said an officer.        
	Ghosh has been living in the house with his 82-year-old wife Panchubala, sons Dulal and Bibhuti and daughter-in law Kalpana (wife of the elder son). The family runs a sari embroidery business.         
	Ghosh said he had moved in as tenant 40 years ago, when the building was owned by Samarendranath Sarkar. The property was later bought by Kanailal Rakshit and the ownership passed on to his sons Subir and Probir after his death.        
	Since I was not notified about the change of ownership, I started paying the rent of Rs 142 to court. I believe Subir and Probir are behind the threats, Ghosh said. The Rakshits could not be contacted.        
	Ghosh said the Guins repeatedly visited his house since November, threatening him to leave. Once we had gone to the police station and found Sandip and his friends there. The officers did not take our complaint, he said. The Jorabagan officer-in-charge, Bikash Chandra Roy, could not be contacted for comment.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Flier held with party drug 
                                                                                                               Flier held with party drug 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A man from Chennai was detained at Calcutta airport on Monday on the charge of trying to smuggle out 15.6kg Ketamine Hydrochloride, often used to make a banned psychedelic drug.        
	The powdery substance, allegedly hidden in four ice cream-making machines, is worth Rs 1.5 crore in the international market. In the rave party circuit, Ketamine Hydrochloride is often loosely referred to as date rape drug.        
	Sangish Khan Kamalbasa, in his mid-30s, was scheduled to take a Thai Airways flight to Bangkok which, sources said, is the centre of a vast market for psychedelic drugs in Southeast Asia.        
	Ketamine Hydrochloride is not banned and can be used to prepare certain veterinary drugs and anaesthetics. But because of its psychedelic attributes, a flier carrying the substance must have prior consent of the Narcotics Control Bureau. Kamalbasa had no such permission, said a customs official.        
	K. Shankar, the director (east) of Narcotics Control Bureau, said: Ketamine Hydrochloride is used as an adulterant in amphitamine-type stimulants, better known as ATS. The stimulant acts on the central nervous system and has a hallucinogenic effect.        
	Kamalbasa, who told the authorities that he earned a living in Chennai selling CDs, arrived at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport around 1pm. When he was approaching the immigration counter, officials sensed something amiss. He was speaking only Tamil but he seemed cagey. We checked his passport but it was in order, said an official.        
	Following an alert from immigration officials, the Central Industrial Security Force checked his luggage using an X-ray and found four ice cream-making machines inside. They let him pass initially, but because of the immigration alert, customs officials again scanned the baggage, using an X-ray as well as manual methods. The ice cream-making machines were broken and the powdered drug was found hidden inside.        
	Officials said Kamalbasas passport revealed he had recently been to Jakarta from Mumbai and Delhi.         
	This time he decided to depart from Calcutta hoping to use the language barrier as a shield, said an official. Sleuths suspect he is part of a large racket.

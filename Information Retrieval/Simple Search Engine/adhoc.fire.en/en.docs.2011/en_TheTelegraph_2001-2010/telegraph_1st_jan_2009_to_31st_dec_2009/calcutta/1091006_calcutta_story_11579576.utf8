The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rs 3.5 lakh college seat lure leads to arrest
                                                                                                               Rs 3.5 lakh college seat lure leads to arrest
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A 35-year-old resident of Salt Lake was arrested on Monday afternoon on the charge of duping a student of Rs 3.5 lakh by promising him a seat in a private engineering college of his choice.         
	Police said the accused, Ramkrishna Dutta, ran a career counselling firm in DB Block.         
	The student who was duped had ranked 19,400 in the Joint Entrance Examination and could not get into either of his two preferred private engineering colleges in Salt Lake and Garia in the first round of counselling, said Debabrata Das, the additional superintendent of police (Bidhannagar).        
	Dutta told the student that he knew top officials of his preferred colleges and could get him admitted into either, Das added.        
	Convinced, the students parents paid Rs 3.5 lakh to Dutta two months ago. The student told the cops that whenever he asked Dutta about his admission, he assured him things were on course.         
	Then the student appeared for the next round of counselling and got admission in one of the two colleges on his own. After securing admission, the student and his father went back to Dutta and demanded their money back. Dutta refused to return the money and threatened to inform the college authorities that the student had tried to buy a seat, said an investigating officer.         
	The family lodged a complaint with Bidhannagar (north) police station last month. We checked Duttas credentials and found that his consultancy firm did not have the necessary clearances. We verified the details of the money transfer and arrested Dutta, the officer said.         
	Dutta would be produced in court on Tuesday, where the police said they would press cheating charges against him.         
	We are probing if Dutta had duped other people with similar promises. We are aware of interstate rackets that promise admission in colleges of repute or send dummy candidates for entrance exams. Duttas links with such rackets are also being probed, said the officer.

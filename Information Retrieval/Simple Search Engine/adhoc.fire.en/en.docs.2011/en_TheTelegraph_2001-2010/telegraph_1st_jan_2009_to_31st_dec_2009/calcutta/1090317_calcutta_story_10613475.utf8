The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Dredging damage to trees
                                                                                                               Dredging damage to trees

	Damage to trees during the dredging of Kestopur canal has prompted the forest department to ask the Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco) to stop the work, if necessary.        
	We are yet to examine how many trees were damaged and to what extent. It seems the mechanical arm of the dredger might have hit trees while dumping muck from the canal bed on the bank on the VIP Road side, said a forest department official.        
	According to sources in the department, over two dozen full-grown trees have been fatally damaged this way since the dredging started about three months ago.        
	Hidco officials claimed that other agents, too, were responsible for the damage to trees.        
	Residents of buildings along VIP Road, and in Bangur, Lake Town and Dum Dum Park disputed the claim. I saw the gigantic iron arm of the dredger hit branches of mature trees several times. I asked the operator to avoid the trees but he ignored my pleas. Reckless operation is the main reason for the damage, alleged Sanjay Ghosh, a resident of Lake Town.        
	The dredging should have been carried out more carefully. The green cover along VIP Road is precious, especially with the rise in the number of vehicles, said Bangur resident Sunil Seth.        
	Trees are packed most closely in the Lake Town-Golaghata area and residents fear that many more trees would be damaged if the portion of the canal on the stretch is dredged without adequate precautionary measures.        
	Hidco officials supervising the dredging said they were aware of the damage. But it is very difficult to control the mechanical arm of the dredger precisely and branches are breaking easily. The dredger operator is dumping the muck very carefully so that the trees suffer minimum damage, said a Hidco official. The general manager of Hidco, Pradyut Biswas, promised to look into the matter.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jadavpur University (JU) on Wednesday decided to launch a drive to curb alcohol and drug abuse by students.        
	The plan includes stress management workshops by psychiatrists and other professionals. Students will be taught how to deal with peer pressure at the sessions.        
	The university also wants to undertake campaigns against alcoholism under the guidance of psychiatrists. Students will be encouraged to take up yoga and exercise.         
	A parent-teacher association has also been proposed so that the authorities can alert a guardian as soon as his or her ward starts abusing alcohol or drugs.        
	The proposal to address drug addiction and alcoholism among students  on the lines suggested by the UGC  was placed in a meeting of the universitys executive council, its highest policy-making body, on Wednesday.        
	The council members unanimously agreed that immediate steps were required to stop drug and alcohol abuse by students, said a senior member of the council.        
	Concerned with reports that more and more university students were becoming alcoholics, the UGC sent a circular to universities, including JU, in end-November with guidelines to tackle the problem.        
	The UGC circular was discussed at the meeting of the council. The council has decided to implement as much as possible the UGC guidelines, said Partha Pratim Biswas, a teacher of engineering faculty and a member of the executive council.         
	Exam rule change        
	The Calcutta University syndicate on Wednesday ratified the undergraduate councils decision to introduce a no-detention policy in BA, BSc and BCom examinations.         
	In the new system  slated to be implemented in 2010  students appearing in BA, BSc and BCom Part I and Part II will be promoted under a credit-based system even if they fail or skip a given number of papers.        
	They will be given a fixed time  three years or more after Part III  to clear the backlog, including any paper they might fail to clear in Part III.         
	A 10-member committee has been asked to decide the specifics of the system and submit a report within three weeks, said a senior member of the syndicate, one of the two policy-making bodies of the university.        
	In the current system, students who fail up to two papers in Part I have to clear the backlog along with Part II to appear in Part III without losing a year.

                      Mother and child                    Art is mostly born of some form of autobiographical contemplation. But its expression is transformed in such a way that it becomes difficult to detect its link with the artists own experience. The works of Sumana Ghosh revolve around her own life and the quintessential elements of her inner being. However, a contemplative inwardness underlines her paintings and drawings which she prefers to keep rooted to reality. The naivete of her naturalistic expression helps her posit a refreshing innocence in her creations. Yet, her artistic consciousness is not entirely devoid of strife and melancholy. What she achieves in her works is a wonderful visual harmony that has the power to transform images of everyday life to moments of meditative beauty. Built within a formal, naturalistic structure, her works show an affinity to folk simplicity and indigenous identity. In Transcendental Bondage, the fourth solo show of her works, she explores her experience of motherhood. The child is used as a recurrent theme in her recent paintings and emphasises the bond it shares with the mother, with the relationship being carried forward to a metaphysical level.                    Event: An exhibition of paintings and drawings by Sumana Ghosh When: Till March 17; 4 pm - 8 pm Where: Samokal Art Gallery, 23 Gariahat Road, Gol Park

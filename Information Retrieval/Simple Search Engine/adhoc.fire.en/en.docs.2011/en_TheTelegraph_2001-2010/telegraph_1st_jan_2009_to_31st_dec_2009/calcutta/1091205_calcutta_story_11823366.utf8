          A STAFF REPORT                          Surjya Kanta Mishra at SSKM on Friday. (Amit Datta)                                  
	State health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra inaugurated an autopsy centre and two revamped departments at SSKM Hospital on Friday.        
	Bodies had to be sent from the only super-speciality government hospital in the state to the Mominpur morgue for post-mortem. Mishra, a doctor, said the new facility would benefit relatives of patients and boost research.        
	I am happy that doctors and students, apart from conducting autopsies in unnatural death cases, will be able to carry out pathological autopsies, which will help them understand ailments better, said Mishra. A faculty member said students pursuing MBBS at SSKM had been visiting Calcutta Medical College and Hospital for the 12 post-mortems that were part of the course.         
	Till about 25 years ago, pathological post-mortem used to be done at SSKM, added the teacher.        
	The head of the plastic surgery department, Bijay K. Majumdar, said relatives of patients who died of burns would no longer need to run around for the mandatory post-mortem.        
	The minister also launched a new building for physical medicine and rehabilitation and upgraded facilities for the ENT department.        
	Mishra, who was accompanied by PWD minister Kshiti Goswami, faced protests from students regarding vacant teachers posts in physiotherapy and other departments.

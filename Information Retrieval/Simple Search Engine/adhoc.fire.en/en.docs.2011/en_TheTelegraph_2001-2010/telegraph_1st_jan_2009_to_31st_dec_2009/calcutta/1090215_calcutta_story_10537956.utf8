										      CITY LIGHTS                        An instrument displayed at Indian Museum				                           
	Music should be dynamic, it should evolve. Thats the idea one came back with from a recent lecture on musical instruments inspired by natural imagery at the Indian Museum. The speaker was Henrietta Lidchi, the keeper of world cultures at the National Museum of Scotland.         
	Lidchi described a new gallery at the Edinburgh museum that will house the nature-inspired instruments. She was accompanied by musician Victor Gama, who is creating the instruments.         
	I am inspired by things in nature, like for example, a birds nest, said Gama. One of his instruments, in fact, does look like the nest of a weaver bird.         
	The other instruments include the Tipaw (inspired by a tiger paw), the Tartul (inspired by a tarantula), the Tonal Matrix and the Vulk (inspired by a volcano).         
	The story of the Taipaw is dramatic. I thought of a tiger hiding inside the gallery and attacking the visitor. I thought of the paws of the tiger and that led to the birth of this instrument, says Gama. The instrument is designed like a tigers paw, with two musical bowls forming the base.         
	The inspiration is seen more in the instruments shape and form than its sound, he said. The sound is dictated more by the materials used, said Gama, who says he is closer to Indian ragas than western sounds.         
	Research for his instruments take him across the globe, and he has already been to India to get the singing bowls for the Taipaw. As of now he is the only one who knows how to play his instruments, says the man who is fascinated by the sitar and is a fan of Pandit Ravi Shankar.        
	Lidchi said: The gallery will encourage people to interact with the instruments on display.         
	American underbelly        
	Michael Patrick MacDonald, who grew up in the poor white neighbourhoods of Southie or South Boston at a time when the area was controlled by the drug mafia, writes about an America usually a white man isnt associated with. In town for the Book Fair, he read out extracts at the American Center from his memoir All Souls: A Family Story From Southie and its sequel, Easter Rising: An Irish American Coming Up from Under.         
	His is a heart-rending story. In the neighbourhood he grew up in, 75 per cent of households were dependent on the income of a single mother and the streets were flooded with cocaine where people were made to disappear. MacDonald lost three of his siblings (they were a family of 11, and often heard the old joke about Irish Catholics and rabbits) to violent crime and one to pneumonia. The baby who died of pneumonia was lost since at that time it wasnt compulsory to take welfare patients. He would try to tell himself that things were not as bad as they sounded.         
	It was a neighbourhood where no one talked about their problems, said MacDonald. It was also ignored by the government since no one would recognise that a white neighbourhood would have such problems. It was believed that crime and drugs could only happen in black, Hispanic or Asian areas, said the author who had developed a psychosomatic condition called a heavy head, brought about by suppression of emotions. He found a way out finally when he started going to black churches and worked with their community service groups.         
	His first book ends with a vigil in the neighbourhood church, where a victims family could light a candle in the name of the loved one who had died. It was important to transform the pain into something thats useful, he said.         
	Spanish letter        
	Theres no knowing in what ways the Book Fair inspires creativity in the Calcuttan. Pallab Patlack learnt Spanish at the Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture. He also did a course in direction from a local film school.         
	When the Book Fair hosted Spain as the theme country in 2006, I thought this was the perfect opportunity to marry two interests, says Patlack.         
	So he went round the theme pavilion, handycam in hand. I spoke to the Spanish visitors, including Maria Fernanda Santiago Bolanos, one of the most important contemporary authors of Spain, who inaugurated the fair.         
	The result was a 35-minute film titled La Feria Del Libro (The Book Fair). When Patlack sent it for Censor Board clearance, he was in for a pleasant surprise.         
	His film was marked as a Spanish film in the certificate. Is it the first documentary made by an Indian in Spanish? Patlack does not know.         
	He is more keen on showing the letters of praise that his film received from the Delhi office of Instituto Cervantes, the Spanish government unit responsible for promoting the study and the teaching of Spanish language and culture. The letters were in Spanish, of course!         
	All for one        
	Rock band Parikramas new composition One, set in the backdrop of the Mumbai terror attacks, has a Calcutta connect.         
	During 26/11, we were performing at the coronation ceremony of the King of Bhutan. From Bhutan, we flew to Calcutta for a gig at Someplace Else and got a call from a television channel wanting to record a song with us in the backdrop of the terror attacks. One was composed at The Park Hotel, says Subir, a member of the band.         
	The New Delhi-based band was in the city recently for a performance at Dublin, ITC The Sonar Calcutta. The band  that has shared the stage with heavy metal cult band Iron Maiden  recreated their heady melody and treated Calcutta to two new songs.         
	We composed Screaming Town for our concert in Bangalore on February 15. It is our fifth concert with Iron Maiden and we wanted to do something special, says Subir. The other song is One.

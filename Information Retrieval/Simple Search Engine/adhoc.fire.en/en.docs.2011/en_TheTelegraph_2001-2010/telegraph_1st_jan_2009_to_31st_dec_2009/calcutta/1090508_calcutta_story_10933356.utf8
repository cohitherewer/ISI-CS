                A fire broke out in a thermocol factory in Alampur, under Howrahs Domjur police station, around 9.30am on Thursday. The fire spread quickly to other parts of the factory and the area was soon enveloped in thick black smoke. No one has been injured though around 100 workers were at work when the fire broke out. Four tenders took two-and-a-half hours to douse the blaze. Local residents alleged that fires frequently broke out in the factory. An officer of the fire services department said the factory lacked safety measures.     A 23-year-old woman and her two-year-old daughter went missing on Wednesday morning after they left home for Barasat. Police said Lipika Mondal, the mother, was supposed to deposit money to a non-banking finance company in Barasat. Lipika works as an agent of the company in Jagatpur near Baguiati. Police said her cellphone was switched off from Wednesday evening. A police complaint has been lodged. A preliminary probe has revealed that the duo did not reach Barasat.     A 50-year-old man died on Thursday morning after a car hit him on Central Garden Reach Road. Police said Amal Kanti Sardar was crossing the road when the mishap occurred. The resident of South Colony in the port area was taken to SSKM Hospital, from where he was discharged after treatment. But Sardars condition deteriorated at night and he was admitted to Garden Reach Hospital, where he died around 1am on Thursday. The driver has been arrested and the vehicle impounded.    Country liquor worth Rs 1 lakh was seized from various parts of Baruipur on Wednesday night. Police said the outlets did not have licence. No one has been arrested.    Residents of Sarat Ghosh Garden Road in Kasba went without power for more than five hours on Thursday morning. Power supply was suspended in the area around 10am as some civic employees were trimming trees. The men left around 1pm assuring the residents that power would be restored soon. But the supply resumed around 3.30pm. CESC sources blamed the delay in resumption of service on a communication gap with the civic authorities.

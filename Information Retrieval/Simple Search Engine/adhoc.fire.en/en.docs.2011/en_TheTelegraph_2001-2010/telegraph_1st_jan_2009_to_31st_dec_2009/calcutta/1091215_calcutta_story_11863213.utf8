The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cops suspended after traders protest
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Cops suspended after traders protest
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	An assistant sub-inspector and a constable of Amherst Street police station were suspended on Monday after residents and traders staged a roadblock to protest their regular demand for bribe.         
	Senior officers, who pacified the protesters, ordered a departmental probe against the two policemen.        
	Two policemen have been suspended on the basis of a complaint by traders. If a probe reveals that they were guilty, stern action will be taken against them, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters).        
	Assistant sub-inspector P. Dey and constable Swadesh Mukherjee, who were patrolling the area on a motorcycle, intercepted a lorry on APC Road near the Rajabazar crossing around 9am. The lorry was carrying fish to Koley market in Sealdah.        
	The policemen allegedly demanded Rs 500 from the truck driver saying the vehicles papers were not in order. As the driver refused to pay up, an altercation broke out between him and the cops, drawing the attention of residents and traders, said an officer of Amherst Street police station.        
	A group of fish traders from Koley market also reached the spot. Around 80 traders squatted on the road surrounding the accused policemen. The traders demanded intervention of senior officers and punishment for the duo, added the officer.        
	The deputy commissioner of police (north division), Biswarup Ghosh, and an assistant commissioner rushed to the spot. They spoke to the agitating traders and residents, who said the two policemen often extorted money from truck drivers headed towards nearby markets.        
	Ghosh asked the protesters to file a written complaint against the two policemen. As soon as the complaint was lodged, the two were suspended, said another officer.        
	The two policemen are extortionists in uniform. They used to collect Rs 500 to Rs 2,000 from each truck driver. We warned them several times that we would lodge a complaint against them but they did not bother to mend their ways, said a trader at Koley market.        
	The blockade was withdrawn in half an hour after Ghosh told the traders that the policemen had been suspended.        
	During the course of our probe, we will talk to traders and local residents and record their statements. If the statements match, then we will be sure that the allegation was correct, said a senior officer at Lalbazar police headquarters.

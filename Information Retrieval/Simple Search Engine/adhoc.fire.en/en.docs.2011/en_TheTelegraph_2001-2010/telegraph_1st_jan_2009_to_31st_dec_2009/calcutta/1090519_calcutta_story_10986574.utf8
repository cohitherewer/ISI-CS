  - New colour of celebration at Writers          KINSUK BASU AND SANAT KUMAR SINHA                          Around 100 employees owing allegiance to the Trinamul Congress smeared each other with green abir during lunchtime on Monday and then marched down the corridors raising victory slogans. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha                                        
	Give me green was the lunchtime slogan in some corridors of the red fort on Monday as government employees owing allegiance to the Trinamul Congress made a meal of the Left Fronts morale  or whatever was left of it.                  
	In what ranks as a first in the history of Bengals seat of power, Trinamul supporters celebrating the partys poll victory smeared each others faces with green abir and roamed Writers Buildings shouting slogans like Dike dike jitlo ke? TMC abar ke! (Whos won everywhere? Who else but the TMC!).        
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was within earshot, though it isnt known whether he saw red or turned green with envy at the celebration in his lair.        
	Dada, grille ta tala diye din, nahole pore bolben je aamra bawaal korchhi (Lock the grille, otherwise you will say later that we are causing a commotion), one of the 100-odd employees warned a policeman guarding the corridor leading to finance minister Asim Dasguptas office.        
	The chief minister left his first-floor office for lunch almost unnoticed when the group  part of the Federation of Secretariat Employees (United)  was on the third floor.        
	Nobody opposed the celebration  the cops stared but didnt interfere, leaders of the Left-backed employees unions cringed but steered clear of a confrontation.        
	Those on the other side of the divide exercised restraint, too.        
	When one of the Trinamul supporters tried to raise a provocative slogan, a colleague berated him. We dont want trouble, do we?        
	 As the green battalion marched through the corridors, employees having lunch in their offices craned their necks from windows, doors and cubicles for a glimpse.         
	The march ended around 2pm with a round of speeches by union leaders perched on plastic chairs.        
	Celebration over, the employees trooped back to their offices. Aaj amader kormosuchi bhalo hoyechhey (Our programme went off well), one of them barked into his cellphone.        
	Old-timers said they had never before witnessed such a bold celebration by the Opposition camp at Writers Buildings.        
	I joined as a group-D employee in 1966 but this is the first time I have seen a group of employees openly smearing one another with green instead of red abir, said Swapan Das, an employee of the finance departments central despatch office.        
	According to Das, employees owing allegiance to the Congress had celebrated at Writers when the party came to power in 1972 but nobody dared use the green colour.        
	So, was Mondays no-holds-barred celebration at Writers meant to be a release of pent-up emotions? It wasnt planned. When we turned up at our federations office in the morning, some of our members said they had brought abir and wanted to celebrate. We had asked them not to venture beyond the space just outside our party office. But the march through the corridors was so spontaneous that we couldnt stop them, claimed Sanket Chakrabarty, the federations secretary.         
	The mood in the office of the Left-backed Coordination Committee  the apex state government employees union  mirrored the mood of the ruling party since the poll results were declared on Saturday. Three members were seated in the office waiting for their colleagues to turn up. You could have heard a pin drop inside the room.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Father plea for maintenance
                                                                                                               Father plea for maintenance
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 78-year-old retired engineer who exhausted his savings on his wifes treatment has moved court, seeking maintenance from their elder son, who occupies a floor of the couples house.         
	Debaprasad Basu, who retired as an assistant engineer of Durgapur Projects Ltd, a state government undertaking, said: I am not eligible for pension. I had planned to provide for myself and my wife by renting out a floor of our house. But my elder son occupies a floor of the two-storeyed house and also does not take care of us. I cannot even continue my wifes treatment.        
	Debaprasads wife Ava has been suffering from asthma for 40 years. She had a cardiac attack three years ago and a cataract surgery in her left eye three months ago. She needs a surgery in her right eye too, but I have run out of money. So her treatment has stopped despite she being the official owner of the house, Debaprasad told Metro.        
	The couples electricity connection is about to be snapped because of non-payment of bill.        
	Their elder son Soumen, 47, and his family stay on the second floor of the Regent Park house. The 47-year-old owns a car and a motorcycle and has installed air-conditioners, states the plea.        
	The younger son Subhen, 45, and his wife and child share the ground floor with his parents but have a separate set-up. According to the plea, Soumen earns Rs 40,000 a month from construction business. Subhen works in a travel agency.         
	Debaprasad moved the plea in an Alipore court on July 23 demanding for Rs 7,000 per month from his son. The court had summonsed Soumen. His lawyer attended Tuesdays hearing, without Soumens submission. Chief judicial magistrate Apurba Sinha Roy ordered Soumen to be present at the next hearing on August 18, failing which the court will pass an ex parte judgment, the petitioners counsel said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Lorry chase kills cop
                                                                                                               Lorry chase kills cop
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A police officer chasing a fleeing cement-laden lorry on his motorcycle in central Calcutta died after being hit by a mini-truck coming from the opposite direction early on Wednesday.        
	Assistant sub-inspector Subhas Chandra Sharma and constable Shyamal Kumar Mandal were on night patrol at Wellington when they spotted the lorry going down Nirmal Chandra Street and waved to the driver to stop.        
	 The driver stepped on the pedal instead of stopping, prompting Sharma and his colleague to give chase. There was no other vehicle on the street except for a mini-truck approaching from Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road, an officer of the traffic department said.         
	The speeding lorry rammed into the mini-truck at the crossing of Nirmal Chandra Street and Lenin Sarani.        
	The mini-truck lost control, hurtled towards the motorcycle and smashed into it. Sharma died instantly while Mandal fractured his leg.        
	Seven more persons, all on the mini-truck that was loaded with vegetables, suffered minor injuries.        
	The drivers of both vehicles were later arrested and booked on charges of rash driving.        
	An investigating officer said Sharma and his colleague from Taltala police station might have been trying to stop the lorry for a random check, though he didnt rule out the possibility of the duo intending to extort money.         
	We are looking at all the possibilities. We are aware of some policemen trying to fleece drivers of goods vehicles at night, he said.        
	Officers of the traffic department said Sharma could have used his walkie-talkie to contact the nearest patrol car or checkpoint instead of giving chase on his motorcycle.        
	Policemen stopping heavy vehicles to extort money from the drivers is a common sight on the streets of Calcutta, especially at night.        
	Two members of a radio flying squad died when their vehicle collided with a lorry on Red Road during a similar chase in February 2007.

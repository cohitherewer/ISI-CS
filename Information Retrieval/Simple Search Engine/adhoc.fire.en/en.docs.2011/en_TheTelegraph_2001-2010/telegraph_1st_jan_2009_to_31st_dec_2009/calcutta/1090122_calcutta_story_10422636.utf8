          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Married daughters have the same right to meet and take care of their mothers as the sons, a high court division bench observed on Tuesday. Justice K.J. Sengupta and Justice Tapan Mukherjee were hearing a petition filed by Soma Mirda (nee Sarkar), 40, who was seeking a court directive to her brother to allow her to visit her 76-year-old ailing mother.         
	The court asked advocate Shilpi Sengupta and a woman officer of Regent Park police station to assist Soma during her two-hour daily visits to her mother at her brother Sudips home in Garia.        
	Soma, a schoolteacher, told the court she had taken her mother, an Alzheimers patient, to her home for treatment. But in mid-2008, Sudip allegedly took away Laxmirani forcibly.         
	Since then Sudip hasnt allowed my client to meet or take care of Laxmirani. But Soma came to know that Sudip was not looking after their mother well, Somas counsel Subroto Mukherjee alleged while moving the petition. He also told the court that on October 8, 2008, Soma had lodged a complaint with Regent Park police station, but the cops didnt come to her aid.         
	Opposing Mukherjees submission, state counsel Nisith Adhikari had said: This is a domestic quarrel. What can the police do? After hearing both sides, the bench had asked Sudip to bring Laxmirani to court on Wednesday. The judges spoke to the mother and the siblings separately and passed the order.

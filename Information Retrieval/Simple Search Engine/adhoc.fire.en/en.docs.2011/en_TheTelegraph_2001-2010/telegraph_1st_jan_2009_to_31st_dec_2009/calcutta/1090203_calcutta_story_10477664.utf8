                      Books and the city                    Almost synonymous with its book culture, Calcuttas life of imagination and intellect is nurtured by itinerant book-vendors, roadside book stalls and old book shops run by families through generations. Kolkata: Book City (edited by Sria Chatterjee and Jennie Renton), an anthology of essays by eminent authors and scholars, chronicles diverse aspects of the citys book life. Its book world brings into interface people from many social strata, in a community which reflects the complex layers of life in the city. Abhijit Gupta talks about preserving Calcuttas printing heritage while Swapan Chakravorty discusses Bengals cornucopia of languages. Among other essays, Sukanta Chaudhuri discusses street books and the bot-tala tradition. Amit Chaudhuri writes about his own reading and the city in terms of numinous fragments. Also to be found are profiles and personal appreciations of the citys bookshops and publishing houses. With each contributor adding an enlivening personal perspective, what results is an engrossing accumulation of experience. The many faces of and behind the book are also represented through Vinayak Das Guptas evocative photographs of browsers and booksellers, printing presses and bookbinders. This evening, Oxford Bookstore, in association with British Council, hosts its launch and a panel discussion on Kolkata as a city of books to be participated by Nabarun Bhattacharya, Samik Bandyopadhyay, Mandira Sen and Hari Vasudevan.

           Loaded statement: A bus toppled over near Vidyasagar Setu on March 2 as it was carrying excessive load on its rooftop. The Metro report Mishap no bar for luggage-carrier buses, March 4, exposed the lapses on part of the administration, which allows buses to carry such a huge load illegally. Until there is a crackdown on such practices, similar accidents are bound to recur.                                     
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporations decision to put an end to its outdoor fogging campaign is a judicious move (Civic body stops outdoor fogging, March 11).           
	The move, though delayed, will be welcomed by Calcuttans as they were being forced to inhale the noxious air after a fogging operation in residential areas. The operation was targeted towards killing mosquitoes, but didnt yield positive results. It temporarily kept mosquitoes away but didnt kill them.           
	For banishing mosquitoes altogether, the civic body should adopt alternative measures.           
	Sewers should be cleaned on a regular basis and sprayed with pesticides, which will kill insects without affecting residents of the area.           
	To ward off mosquito-borne diseases, the civic body should ensure prompt garbage disposal and cleanliness of drains and other outlets, which are the prime breeding grounds for mosquitoes.           
	Besides, raising awareness among people about the dos and donts of fighting mosquitoes is very important.           
	The civic body may also consider distributing bleaching powder and pesticides in highly sensitive areas as alternatives to outdoor fogging.

	The report Pesticide peril in vegetables, March 9, was alarming. Courtesy Subhas Chakraborty, Calcuttans are breathing highly poisonous air. Joining him is the ineffective agriculture minister, who is unable to control the use of dangerous pesticides. Stuck with such inefficient leaders, Calcutta will become a city of sickly people unless corrective steps are taken.

	It is alarming that many vegetables consumed by us, instead of providing nutrients, can irreparably damage our health. The culprit is the indiscriminate use of banned pesticides. If it is proved that distributors are supplying banned pesticides in collusion with a section of government officials, the administration should take immediate action to stop this.           
	It is unfortunate that several items like katatel (adulterated fuel), certain kinds of plastic carry bags and banned pesticides are easily available. When any article is banned, proper steps should be taken to stop its production, distribution and sale. All government departments must work together to implement bans.           
	Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

	With regard to the rampant and indiscriminate use of banned pesticides in vegetables, cant the government take immediate and stringent action against farmers and users of toxic substances? I fail to comprehend how and under what circumstances banned substances come into the hands of farmers and distributors. Is the administration functioning in a vacuum?           
	Salil Kumar Kar, 
  Kedar Nath Das Lane           
	Farmers are easily procuring banned pesticides. This means there are many units manufacturing these products.           
	All such units should be closed down immediately and farmers should be informed about the health hazards caused by such pesticides.

	The report Duo rob security agency owner, March 18, provided comic relief. The incident shows the lackadaisical attitude of city professionals. If a agency cannot manage its own valuables, how is it supposed to provide security to clients? It will be fun to learn how its clients are feeling.             
	Tapan Pal,

	A few days back I saw some men from the power supply department repairing electricity cables and I said to myself, Oh! the elections are ahead. In our country, maintenance is done only before elections, obviously to woo voters. It is high time political parties realised that voters are well aware of such gimmicks. I would relate this incident to the Metro report MLAs fail fund test March 4, which highlights how money meant for development work remains unutilised.

	The luxurious Audi car was planning to enter the Calcutta car market (Audi zooms into town, March 4). However, in a city where the roads are full of potholes, traffic snarls, blockades, and where people are more interested in bandhs and protests, what will such a car do? Calcutta hasnt been able to develop its roads, thanks to the lack of interest of our honourable and educated ministers. Moreover, the lack of jobs and closing of industries makes owning such a car a distant dream for the citys majority.

	Apropos Thousand stumped by Math paper rules, March 7, I fail to understand how an important instruction on the Madhyamik mathematics question paper was allowed to remain ambiguous. As a result, thousands of examinees became confused in the examination hall. Many students are scared of mathematics and the confusion aggravated their agony. The confusion may have also caused some students to fare poorly in the first big examination of their life.

	Apropos the report Girl kidnap foiled, March 11, I was shocked to read that a domestic help tried to abduct her employers daughter. It was reported that the girl was often scolded by her mother. The help lured the girl by promising to take her to Siliguri, where she wouldnt be rebuked by her mother. Parents should solve their kids problems affectionately. They must remember that children want affection from them and only when parents fail to understand them, the kids turn to others for comfort. And some unscrupulous people may take advantage of them.

	Apropos Eastern Railway sits on death trap, March 24, repairs on the foot overbridge at Cossipore was completed by the railways on March 31, 2009. The overbridge was inspected by an engineer of Eastern Railways Sealdah division and found to be sound.             
	The steps of the overbridge are made of reinforced concrete. Because of wear and tear, they need frequent maintenance. The steps are being repaired.           
	Railway electrification work has been sanctioned for this year and to get vertical clearance for the electrical wire, a new foot overbridge is being constructed. Once its ready, the existing overbridge will be dismantled.           
	Apropos Power dips, heat peaks, April 6, the information about a drop in coal supply at the Sagardighi power station is not correct. The Sagardighi plant of the West Bengal State Electricity Company is supposed to receive 42 rakes of coal from indigenous sources per month. In addition, some imported coal is received depending on procurement by the power station.           
	In March 2009, the plant received 51 trains of coal, of which only one was imported. In April, the plant unloaded 17 rakes of coal, of which only two are imported. Hence, against a linkage of 1.4 trains a day, the power station has received 1.7 trains in March and more than 2 trains a day in April. It is thus not clear how the shortage in power generation was attributed to less transportation of coal to the power station.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Delay in phone repairs
                                                                                                               Delay in phone repairs
          OUR BUREAU                          The Circus telephone exchange office after the fire                                   
	Thousands of phones and broadband connections in homes, banks and businesses in central and south Calcutta remained out of order on Monday as repairs after the Circus exchange fire progressed at a snails pace.         
	More than 64,500 landline, 12,000 broadband and 1,600 leased line connections were cut off by the blaze at the Hungerford Street telephone hub last Tuesday.         
	The next day, the chief general manager of Calcutta Telephones had promised to restore the lines in seven days but the target seemed distant on Monday.        
	Over 50 per cent broadband connections and most of the domestic and leased lines have still not been restored, said a BSNL official on Monday. According to sources, the delay in repairs at the exchange is holding up the process.        
	Transactions have been hampered at banks on AJC Bose Road, Park Street, Russell Street, Bondel Road and other areas because of the snag. Residents of the areas also have had to do without telephones.        
	The lines at National Medical College and Hospital had also not been restored till late on Monday, said an official.        
	Chief general manager S. K. Chakravarty had claimed that the water sprayed to douse the flames at the exchange had caused more damage than the fire itself.         
	Fire and emergency services minister Pratim Chatterjee, however, blamed the telephone authorities for the extent of damage. The exchange lacked adequate fire-safety measures, the minister said in the Assembly on Monday.        
	Chatterjee also announced in the House that fire stations would soon come up at Rajarhat, Salt Lake, Dankuni and Nonadanga. The department is looking for land to set up fire stations in other areas, procuring modern equipment and organising training for firefighters, he added.

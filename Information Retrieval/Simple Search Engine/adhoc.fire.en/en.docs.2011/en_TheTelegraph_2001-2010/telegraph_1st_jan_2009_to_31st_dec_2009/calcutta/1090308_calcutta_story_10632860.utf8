The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A touch of class
                                                                                                               A touch of class
										      stage                              
	From a time when male actors played womens parts and women faced flak for appearing on stage to an age when a woman character ties up her rapist and gags him with her undergarment on stage, theatre seems to have come a long way.         
	On International Womens Day (March 8), the lives of two women will be recreated in Ordhek Akaash, written and directed by Abhijit Kargupta. His group Chokh will stage the play at Tapan Theatre at 6.30pm.         
	Kargupta developed the play from news inputs for a television assignment.         
	The play takes off from an incident in West Midnapore, where a girl was tied to a tree for three days and nights on the orders of a salishi court.         
	The girl, named Pushpa in the play, returns to her paternal village after being deserted by a brutish husband. She eventually falls in love with a shopkeeper. The couple run away only to be caught and abused by political party workers. The salishi court releases the man but punishes Pushpa.         
	Pushpas story is juxtaposed with the that of Poulomi Roy. With degrees from Presidency College and Leeds, Poulomi returns to her parents home in Calcutta after winning the Man Booker award. Living away from her husband, Poulomi finds herself attracted to an old flame.         
	As the women meet, we are left to judge whether differences in social, cultural and educational backgrounds can change lives.         
	Taking the discussion further will be Chaar Kanya, to be presented by Total Theatre on March 9 at 6.30pm at Sisir Mancha.         
	Singer Haimanti Shukla, actress, writer and director Suranjana Dasgupta, actress Urmimala Basu and writer Mallika Sengupta will discuss their careers, performing and interacting with the audience.         
	The programme, to be conducted by Chiranjeet Chakraborty, will also include a dance performance by women from Kolkata Sangbed, an NGO that works in red-light areas.         
	Suranjana Dasgupta will perform an excerpt from Mallika Senguptas collection of poems Katha Manabi, which is about women down the ages, from Khona to Kalpana Chawla.       SEBANTI SARKAR

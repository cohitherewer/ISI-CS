The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Aged, ailing amp; cut off by power
                                                                                                               Aged, ailing amp; cut off by power
                              POWERLESS PLIGHT: Renuka Ghosh				                           
	As Calcutta continues to reel under the dual blows of heat and power cuts, the worst hit are the aged and ailing. The likes of Renuka Ghosh, 85, who can only wait in the dark and pray for the lights to come on and the fan to start whirring. Cooped up in a room in an apartment building on Sunil Sen Sarani near Nagerbazar on a sultry Thursday afternoon, she shared her powerless plight  which mirrors that of so many others like her  with Metro        
	I can barely walk since I fell and smashed my right thigh bone near the hip joint more than a decade back. The metal plate that was inserted into my leg after the mishap had to be removed three months ago, further restricting my movements. I am confined to a room in stifling heat, battling the attendant ills of old age, and at the mercy of power cuts.        
	At mid-day, with my son and daughter-in-law at work and my granddaughter at tuition, I sit on my bed, shooting a glance at the still ceiling fan every time a buzz reaches my ear. For close to a month now we have had multiple power cuts every day, often stretching up to five hours.        
	This week has been a nightmare. All that my attendant, who used to take me to the terrace in the afternoons for fresh air, has been doing is waving a plastic hand fan furiously to provide some relief. Going to the terrace is not possible with the lift not working.        
	The irony is my son bought this flat because it had a lift I could use to go up to the terrace. Now, lying in bed on dark evenings, drenched in sweat, I realise to my horror that if I need to visit the hospital even for a minor test, I will have to be stretchered four floors down the stairs.        
	The 1970s and 1980s, when we lived on College Street, were just as bad. I remember local youths forming groups to agitate outside the CESC office after hours of blackout. We would go for walks with our neighbours to College Square during prolonged power cuts. We even used to sleep on the terrace at night during summer.        
	Hand fans made of palm leaves and kerosene lamps used to be the fastest moving items at stationery shops in the Bowbazar market. I remember a prominent manufacturer of stoves had switched to manufacturing kerosene lamps because it was more profitable. I wonder whether the hand fans and lamps have made a comeback in stationery shops after so many years of no power cuts.        
	For me, no power at home has also meant no physiotherapy. With the fan not working, I am drenched in sweat if I try even one of the exercises that the physiotherapist has asked me to do regularly.        
	My grandsons friends used to call Calcutta the largest old-age home in the world, mocking the lack of opportunities here. If they were to come back from Mumbai, Bangalore... and the other places they have moved to for jobs, they would find that power cuts have made their hometown a torture chamber for the elderly.        
	But I am only one of the lakhs of aged people in the city suffering like this. I can at least turn to my family for support when the suffering seems unbearable but many cant even do that.

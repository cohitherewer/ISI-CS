	A constable and a pedestrian were killed in separate road mishaps in the city on Friday.        
	Biswanath Ghosh, a 40-year-old constable at New Alipore police station, was riding pillion on his colleague Dinabandhu Layeks motorcycle. A speeding lorry dashed them at the Chetla Road-New Alipore crossing around 6am.         
	Both were flung off the bike and Ghosh was crushed by the wheels of the lorry. Layek was admitted to SSKM Hospital with leg injuries.        
	After the accident, Layek sent an SOS from his wireless set and a police vehicle patrolling the area intercepted the lorry and arrested the driver.        
	Around 12.30pm on Strand Bank Road, a 55-year-old pedestrian was crushed between two vehicles. The incident took place in front of a godown in the North Port police station area. Balaram Mandal of Joynagar was caught between a lorry moving backwards and a stationary one, said Jawed Shamim, the city detective chief.        
	Police arrested the lorry driver and impounded the vehicle.

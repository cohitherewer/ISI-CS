The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Norwester eludes sultry city
                                                                                                               Norwester eludes sultry city
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Hot and sultry weather is back in the city after a brief respite following Sundays Norwester, with the mercury on Wednesday rising to 37.9 degrees Celsius, two degrees above normal.        
	The discomfort index, at 66 degrees Celsius, was 11 degrees above normal.        
	G.C. Debnath, the director of Alipores Regional Meteorological Centre, blamed the rise in temperature on the weakening of a low-pressure trough over Bengal. As the system weakened, hot, dry wind from the west swept across south Bengal, much like what had happened in April.        
	The weatherman, however, held out hope, saying the situation is not likely to be as drastic as it was between April 18 and 28. There is no reason to fear another spell of heat wave.        
	Wednesdays minimum temperature was 27.7 degree Celsius, two degrees above normal. The humidity ranged between 93 and 48 per cent.        
	The weather office ruled out any possibility of Norwester in the next 24 hours. Thursday will be hot and uncomfortable, with the possibility of thunderclouds in some areas towards afternoon or evening. Temperatures may range between 38 and 28 degree Celsius, Debnath said.        
	The low-pressure trough over Bengal and a cyclonic circulation over Jharkhand had joined forces to bring Sundays Norwester. That low-pressure trough is on the wane now, allowing warm, dry westerlys to blow in, he added.        
	According to Met officials, the city is supposed to experience around four Norwesters each in April and May.        
	But there was none in April this year as the city reeled under a 10-day heat wave, with the mercury crossing the 40-degree mark on eight days.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Property tax row in township
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Property tax row in township
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The Bidhannagar Welfare Association, a residents body in Salt Lake, alleged on Tuesday that Bidhannagar Municipality had started issuing inflated bills for 2008-09 for property tax, violating a court order.        
	On November 27, 2008, the high court had said that the municipality was bound to rectify the amount if any resident objected to the bill. But the municipality is sending bills according to the earlier rate even to those residents who had objected to the amount, said association president Narayan Ghosh.        
	The Supreme Court had stopped the process of tax collection in Salt Lake in May 2007. In October 2008, Calcutta High Court allowed the municipality to collect tax at 30 per cent more than the 1996 rate. The court issued a modified order in November 2008, but the municipality is ignoring it and sending inflated bills, Ghosh said.        
	Every municipality needs revenue.... We cannot force anyone to pay the tax. Its a plea to the residents to do their moral duty, said Biswajiban Majumdar, the chairman of the municipality.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Ransack accused roam free
                                                                                                               Ransack accused roam free
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Police failed to arrest any accused even 24 hours after a cellphone shop in Gariahat was vandalised allegedly by a group of Trinamul Congress supporters.        
	Abhishek Pal, the manager of the Purna Das Road store, lodged a police complaint naming former local councillor Durga Mukherjee as the leader of the rampaging group.        
	Pal alleged that the group went berserk in retaliation to the managers refusal to pay Rs 50,000 to the partys election fund.        
	Sources at Gariahat police station said no raid had been conducted in the past 24 hours to trace the accused, including Mukherjee.        
	In other cases, we swing into action immediately after receiving a complaint. But since yesterday, there has been no order from senior officers to go ahead, an officer said on Sunday.        
	Officer-in-charge Chinmoy Batabyal, however, said: We are trying to find out whether Mukherjee and the others mentioned in the FIR were involved in the vandalism. Action will be taken against them if they are found guilty.        
	Mukherjee could not be contacted as his cellphone was switched off. Wife Deepti Mukherjee, the present councillor, also could not be contacted.        
	Chief electoral officer Debashis Sen expressed shock at the incident. This is outrageous! But this is a criminal matter and the police have to act. I am sure they will. There is no provision for the commission to prosecute those involved in such cases, Sen said.        
	Pal mentioned in the complaint that a civic employee had asked him why he had dumped waste on the road after the civic employees had removed the garbage.        
	I told him the shops garbage cleaner had not turned up and that I would get it cleared by Sunday.... He asked me to turn up at the local Trinamul office, said Pal. Moments later, the gang led by Mukherjee allegedly turned up at the shop.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sourav still the chosen one
                                                                                                                 We Ask You Answer      Sourav still the chosen one
          Todays question: Who do you want to see as captain(s) of Kolkata Knight Riders and why?                                                       
	Samir Cassim Ariff, 
  Address not mentioned        
	I would like to see Sourav Ganguly as the sole captain of the Kolkata Knight Riders for the upcoming season of the IPL. Sourav has played at the highest level and has more experience than others in the team. John Buchanan should look at other captains for the 2010 edition of the tournament.

	I want to see Sourav Ganguly at the helm of the Kolkata Knight Riders.        Arnab Bhadra, 
  Noapara, Baranagar									      
	Sourav is the obvious first choice as the Kolkata Knight Riders captain. The most successful captain of Team India has nothing to prove with bat or ball at the fag end of his career.                 Indranil Sanyal,

										Considering Souravs stupendous record of 22 Test and 76 ODI wins, he is the right choice for leading the Kolkata Knight Riders. He had played well in the last edition of the IPL and managed to bag three man-of-the-match awards. While other teams enjoyed the support of talented foreign recruits, Sourav missed the services of Ricky Ponting, Chris Gayle, Brendon McCullam and Shoaib Akhtar. He still managed to win as many as six matches. What else could he have done? Buchanans idea of deploying four skippers is ridiculous. Ganguly should be retained as the skipper.

										 Sourav Ganguly is perfect for guiding the Kolkata Knight Riders. There is no need for multiple captains, as proposed by John Buchanan.

	I want to see Sourav Ganguly and Brendon McCullum as the captains of the Kolkata Knight Riders. This is because the T20 format requires prompt action and unity to win a match.

	I want to see Sourav Ganguly as the captain of the Kolkata Knight Rider. He is one of the most successful captains ever and knows how to guide the players properly. I dont think anyone will agree with John Buchanans plan. A T20 innings extends only an hour and a half. What will four captains do in that time other than confuse each other?         
	

Dinabandhu Mukherjee,
  Behala        
	Sourav is the best person to lead the Kolkata Knight Rider. He is a reliable batsman, bowler and fielder. The unity of the team will remain intact if he is the captain. The presence of four captains may lead to groupism and jealousy among the players.      
	

Amaresh Paul,
  Bandel									      
	I dont know much about cricket but the presence of Sourav Ganguly on field is very impressive. Unfortunately he has fallen in very adverse situations. But since he is not in the team anymore I dont like watching cricket matches. So I would be very happy to see Sourav as the captain of the Kolkata Knight Riders in the forthcoming IPL matches in South Africa.                 .F. Kamruddin, 
  Bandpur, Hooghly        
	I think John Buchanan should become the captain of the Kolkata Knight Riders. Sourav Ganguly is undoubtedly a world-class player. But he could not help his team win the IPL cup. Since IPL is a business venture and a lot of money is invested in it, winning should definitely be the prerogative of the team-owner. Let Buchanan become the captain of KKR, let him prove his mettle.                 Dipak Bysack, 
  New Alipore        
	Like the cricket fraternity I also want to see Sourav Ganguly as the skipper of the Kolkata Knight Riders as he is one of the finest captains India has ever produced. Sourav enjoys the confidence of his teammates, which has helped him develop and promote the team. He is a players captain. There should be space for just one boss. The Buchanan doctrine of multiple captains is a concept that cannot be accepted. It is ridiculous and unscientific and it will create only confusion on the field and in the dressing room.                Debasish Chakraborty,
  Cossipore, Tallah        
	As far as Sourav Ganguly is concerned, we want to see him as the captain of KKR because he is much more experienced than other cricketers.

	In my opinion Sourav is the best choice for Kolkata Knight Riders. Sourav does not have much experience in the T20 format but it can still work out. It is very unfortunate that IPL is taking place outside India but Indians will always support him.               
	

Goutam Naskar, 
  Domjur, Howrah        
	Obviously I want to see Sourav Ganguly as the captain of KKR. His performance has always been good, except in a few matches. IPL will not be successful without Sourav.              
	

Dilip kumar Biswas, 
  New Alipore        
	Sourav Ganguly is the best captain for the Kolkata Knight Riders. His experience, commitment and aggressive attitude will help the team win. Buchanans idea of four captains will affect the performance of the players.  
	Next week  Should the college authorities go soft on raggers?   Send your views to

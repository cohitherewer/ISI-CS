The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Leader in coma after assault
                                                                                                               Leader in coma after assault
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The outgoing Trinamul Congress commissioner of ward 35 of Rajarhat-Gopalpur municipality, Subir Mondal, has gone into a coma after being beaten up, allegedly by CPM supporters, on Wednesday night. Two men were arrested in connection with the incident.         
	According to witnesses, the incident occurred at Hanapara in Kestopur around 9.30pm while a CPM procession to celebrate the partys victory in the civic polls was passing through the area. Some of the participants allegedly attacked Mondal for escorting police to Trinamul supporter Samar Ghoshs house in the neighbourhood after bombs were thrown at it. The attackers were led by the new commissioner Dilip Dey, claimed Trinamul supporters. Dey denied the charges.         
	Mondal was taken to a private hospital on the EM Bypass. He was put on life support late on Thursday after he went into a coma.        
	Tanmoy Dey and Arun Das were arrested in connection with the incident and RAF was deployed in the area.         
	I have known Subir for years and it would have been better if this had not happened, said Tapas Chatterjee, the chairman of the municipality, evading questions on who was responsible for the attack. The attack was a show of strength by CPM workers. Our workers were assaulted and their homes bombed after the poll results were declared, said Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar, the Trinamul MP from Barasat.

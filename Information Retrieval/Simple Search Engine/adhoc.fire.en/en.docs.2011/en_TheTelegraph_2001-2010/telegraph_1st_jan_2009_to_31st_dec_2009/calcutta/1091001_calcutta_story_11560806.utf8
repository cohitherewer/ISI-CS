The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Reap what you sow, its all in the game
                                                                                                               Reap what you sow, its all in the game
          MALINI BANERJEE                                                  
	Meghali Gupta, 18, is busy farming these days (and nights). Minus the sweat and grime, of course.        
	No, not because she is hooked to Mamata Banerjees maa, mati, manush message but because she is addicted to the computer game called FarmVille.        
	Farming is now the favourite pastime for the Calcutta Netizen  in home and in office, at work and at play  thanks to the application on Facebook, the popular social networking site.        
	The game allows users to build farms and plant and harvest crops, virtually of course.        
	So why is a game turning Calcutta into a city of farmers? Its different. And not as boring as the stupid car racing games that are so common, says 26-year-old Angela Gomes who teaches mathematics in a city school.        
	Zynga, a developer of social games, which is behind FarmVille and other popular games like Texas HoldEm Poker and Mafia Wars and Yoville (an urban life equivalent of FarmVille) claims that the game has more than 11 million active users daily and more than 1 million new active users every week since its launch on June 19, 2009.        
	Manas Mukhopadhyays 18-year-old farmer daughter is one of them. I actually saw my daughter go to sleep with the computer on  she said shed wake up in the middle of the night to harvest crops. This is madness! grumbles the father, wondering why she doesnt put in half that effort into her studies.        
	If you cant beat them join them, smiles Dola Sengupta, who claims to be better at FarmVille than her 15-year-old daughter Keya. When she got hooked to FarmVille, I too decided to play the game. Its helped us bond better as FarmVille neighbours and it also helps me regulate her playing hours, smiles Dola.        
	In offices, members of the FarmVille family have even been found guilty of putting off calls and meetings when its time to harvest crops.        
	The rules are simple and easy to follow. Plant crops at cost price and harvest them at selling price and theres an extra cost for ploughing land. Farmers can also sell animal produce and fruits. Actions like ploughing, planting, helping friends and buying farm items (buildings, trees, animals or decorations) translate into experience points (see box).        
	Its like you are competing with yourself for a better farm or higher level. Its very healthy and positive as opposed to other games where you can sabotage others games. I like the fact that FarmVille doesnt have such negative applications yet, says Vandita Sanghvi, who is self-employed, and plants the moment she steps into office along with checking her mail.        
	The social aspect helps too, as one can be neighbours with friends playing the game and help out on each others farms for experience points and money or leave messages on others farms. Its become sort of a race between friends where you compete to get to the next level before your friends, says Amrita Dhar, an analyst at a multinational bank.        
	It helps express creativity, stress others. I like decorating my farm and looking at the grown crops is very satisfying, says Vandita.        
	But advertising professional Diptanshu Roy, who has also joined the FarmVille fray out of curiosity as everyone at work was playing it, says it is about living vicariously. Ive always wanted to own a farm. So its like living a dream virtually.         
	Change is the name of the farming game. They keep introducing something new every time I get bored of it, says Amrita. One such innovation was superberries, a crop that had a cost price of 10 coins and selling price of 100. The caveat? It had to be harvested two hours after planting and it withered within two hours if not harvested. It ended up disrupting many a weekend schedule. I tried going out only during the time when it would grow, confesses Angela.        
	Superberries have been taken off the market, but the players continue to reap what they sow. A philosophy parents and teachers are hoping young FarmVille fans learn, all in the game.         
	Are you hooked to FarmVille? Why?

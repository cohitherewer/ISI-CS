  - Revenge for help complaint          A STAFF REPORTER                              Abhiram Rout (top) and Gouranga Bhattacharya after the attack. Pictures by Gopal Senapati				                                       
	An extortionist barged into a Howrah house early on Tuesday and attacked the family members with a chopper after their help lodged a complaint against him.        
	Subrata Sanyal, alias Gabu, and his henchmen later threw bombs while the injured were being taken to hospital, inflicting splinter wounds on some other members of the Bhattacharya family and their neighbours.        
	The familys 29-year-old help Abhiram Rout, who also works as a driver for a local doctor, had lodged the complaint after Sanyal beat him up and snatched Rs 3,000 while he was returning to Dilip Bhattacharyas house late on Monday.        
	Howrah police chief Niraj Kumar Singh said: Subrata Sanyal and his associates are absconding. We are trying to arrest him. Sanyal has a criminal record.        
	Rout narrated the incident to Dilips 35-year-old nephew Gouranga, who accompanied the help to Chatterjeehat investigation centre. They returned home around 12.10am from the police station. We were preparing to go to bed when Gabu and three or four of his associates barged into our drawing room. Gabu pointed a pistol at Gouranga and asked him why he had lodged a complaint against him. In desperation, I pushed Gabu from behind as a result of which he dropped his pistol. He then started attacking everyone in the room with a chopper. Gouranga and his brother Nityananda were seriously injured, said Dilip. He later handed over the pistol to police.         
	Neighbours followed by two constables and an assistant sub-inspector reached the house hearing shouts for help. When the policemen were taking the injured to hospital, the gang threw two bombs at them. Nityanandas mother Krishna and 18-year-old son Arijit sustained splinter injuries.        
	Bandana Bhattacharya, a neighbour who was also hit by the splinters, said: Even the policemen got scared after the gang started throwing bombs. The cops started running for cover along with other residents. Soon many more policemen reached the spot and took us to hospital.         
	Samiran Bhattacharya, another neighbour, said: We have lodged complaints with Chatterjeehat investigation centre about criminal activities in the area several times but no action has been taken.

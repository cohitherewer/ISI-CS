The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mock threat, real panic   Run out or run home
                                                                                                               Mock threat, real panic   Run out or run home
  - A few fliers flee amp; employees head home after bomb drill          SANJAY MANDAL                                                  
	A couple of fliers left the queue at a ticket counter and rushed out. A group fled, leaving lunch unfinished in the first-floor restaurant. A few employees, missing even after the all clear sign was flashed, were found to have quietly headed home.        
	A mock bomb scare at the city airport on Friday afternoon triggered panic among fliers  some of whom were forced to abandon their journey plans  and provided an excuse to a few employees to treat it as a half-holiday.        
	The bomb drill was conducted in the international terminal building between 2.05pm and 2.30pm. At 2pm, the airport managers office was told over phone that a bomb had been planted in the building.        
	The manager immediately made an announcement through the public address system, urging passengers to evacuate and remain 100 metres away from the building.                           
	The CISF repeated the announcement on the first and second floors. The area was soon cordoned off and fire tenders, ambulances, police vehicles and men from the bomb detection squad swooped down on the building.        
	The announcements spread panic among all those present. Several fliers eating in the first-floor restaurant fled, leaving behind unfinished meals, said an airport official.        
	Two passengers were standing in front of the GMG Airlines counter to buy tickets for a Dhaka-bound flight scheduled to take off on Friday evening. They ran away on hearing the announcements, said an airline official.        
	Five or six employees could not be traced after the alarm fell silent. The authorities later found they had headed home amidst the chaos.        
	The drill left Nasreen, a resident of Dhaka, jittery about flying. I am very scared. I hope the journey will end without any more trouble.

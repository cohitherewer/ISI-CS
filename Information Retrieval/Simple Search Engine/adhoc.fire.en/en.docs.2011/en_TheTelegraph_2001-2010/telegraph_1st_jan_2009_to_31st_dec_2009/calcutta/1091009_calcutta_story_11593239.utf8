                                                                                                               Killer hubby still critical
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Santanu Chowdhury at the nursing home on Wednesday                                   
	The condition of Santanu Chowdhury, the 22-year-old who shot his wife before turning the gun on himself, deteriorated on Thursday even as police charged him with murder, attempt to suicide and illegal possession of arms.         
	Santanu was on a ventilator throughout Thursday and could not be operated on.        
	He is suffering from acute myocardial infarction, which is extremely uncommon in a patient of his age. The bullet and broken bone are still lodged in his brain cavity but we cannot operate on him until his cardiac condition becomes stable, said Bhaskar Ghoshal, a consultant surgeon and the superintendent of the nursing home in Garia where Santanu is admitted.         
	Because of his poor heart condition, we cannot use strong drugs to dissolve the blood clot in his brain, added Ghoshal.        
	The police have pressed charges but have not made much headway in the investigation, said a senior district cop.         
	Family members of Santanu, some of his friends and neighbours were interrogated on Thursday as the police tried to piece together information about the couples lifestyle.        
	Santanu, a school dropout, lived with his wife in his parents Sonarpur house. He shot himself in the right temple after killing his wife on the terrace early on Wednesday.        
	We want to know how he got hold of the single-shot gun and what prompted him to kill his wife and shoot himself. We cant progress much until Santanu recovers, said the officer.         
	According to him, most of the neighbours have told the police that Santanu was a shy boy who preferred to maintain a low profile.        
	Family members, however, claimed that Santanus relationship with his parents was strained since he and his wife used to take drugs.        
	Santanus father Ranadhir, an ONGC officer who retired last month, was pressuring him to change his lifestyle and start working.         
	Ranadhir and some other relatives visited the nursing home on Thursday. Santanus mother could not make it to the nursing home as she was in a state of shock and fainted several times.         
	We have consulted some other doctors But we cannot move him anywhere unless his condition improves, said a relative.

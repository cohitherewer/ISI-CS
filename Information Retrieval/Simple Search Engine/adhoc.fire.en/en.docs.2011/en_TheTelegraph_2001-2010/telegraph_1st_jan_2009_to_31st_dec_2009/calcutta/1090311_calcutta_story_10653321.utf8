The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Vivekananda flyover in 18 months 
                                                                                                               Vivekananda flyover in 18 months 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          The foundation stone of the flyover being laid in February                                  
	The government will try to complete the first phase of the proposed Vivekananda Road flyover in a year and a half if work begins in a few weeks, chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said after a review meeting on Tuesday.        
	Transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury and police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti attended the review meeting at Writers Buildings.        
	The centre has already sanctioned funds under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission for the first phase of the flyover, connecting Howrah bridge with Girish Park. The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) will execute the project.        
	If we can start work in two or three weeks, it should take about 18 months to complete the first phase, the chief secretary said. The two-lane structure would cost about Rs 164 crore and tenders have been floated by the CMDA, he added.        
	The transport secretary said his department had twice laid the foundation stone for the flyover but could not proceed with the work as the government decided to approach the Centre for funds.         
	The project plan had to be altered because of the presence of the abandoned mint on Strand Road. However, engineering solutions are ready in case of any difficulty, said Chowdhury.        
	According to a transport department official, in the second phase, the flyover will be extended from Girish Park to the airport through Maniktala. The final drawing hasnt yet been done. After completion of the first phase, the government will approach the Centre for funds for the second phase.        
	The officials also reviewed the proposed flyover between Jodhpur Park and Sukanta Setu. It would cost about Rs 100 crore, a part of which will be provided under the urban renewal mission.        
	Traffic congestion is common near Jadavpur police station because of South City Mall. We would request the mall authorities to bear 20 per cent of the cost of building the flyover. They had earlier agreed to bear 10 per cent of the cost, said the transport secretary.

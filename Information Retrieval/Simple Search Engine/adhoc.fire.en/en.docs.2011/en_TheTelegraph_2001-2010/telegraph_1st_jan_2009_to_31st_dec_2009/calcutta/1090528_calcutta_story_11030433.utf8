The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tech tools tripped by whoosh and wire
                                                                                                               Tech tools tripped by whoosh and wire
          RITH BASU                                                  
	 Abhijit Mukherjee, a 40-year-old resident of Kalighat, has watched all the Manchester United matches in the Champions League this year but was set to miss the clubs face-off with Barcelona in the final. His cable connection  snapped on Monday afternoon  was not restored till late on Wednesday.        
	 Lionel Messi (and by default Barcelona) fan Rajib Biswas had no way of knowing whether his cable was working or not. There was no power and water at his Hridayapur house for three days.        
	Biswas and Mukherjee were among the numerous Calcuttans who were having to do without their favourite gadgets, be it a television or a high-end smartphone, because of the power crisis brought on by cyclone Aila        
	I called up my multi-system operator Siti Cable but they could not assure me that the beam would be back before the kick-off. The snapped wires were tangled around trees and nothing could be done till the trees were removed, they told me, grumbled Mukherjee.        
	Apart from having to make through sweltering days without water, air-conditioners or fan and nights without light or television, lack of power has also meant curtailed conversations with cellphone batteries running out, no broadband connectivity and long queues at ATMs.         
	According to Biswas, a trader, many BSNL lines in the Barrackpore locality were down. The situation is pathetic. We cannot sleep because of the heat, we cannot take a bath even if we are drenched in sweat, we cannot watch TV to distract ourselves and we cannot use the phone to find out the situation elsewhere or seek help.         
	With the broadband down in several pockets of the city, businesses struggled to interact with clients abroad and were forced to cancel video conferences.         
	Blackberry users received messages from their office IT wings, warning that there might be problems with Internet connectivity. Many did not receive emails on their phones throughout the day and experienced the woes of a world without Google, as one of them put it.        
	Internet connections to homes were also hit. I had to finish a project urgently. But my broadband connection was either not working or too slow, said Diptangshu Mitra, a resident of Shakuntala Park in Behala.        
	Uprooted trees had snapped overhead fibre cables on Monday but most of the connections were restored by Tuesday. There were, however, some snags on Wednesday as well, as CESC workers inadvertently cut cables during repairs, said an official of Internet service provider Sify.        
	ATMs of some banks were out of order too. We have 575 ATMs in the Bengal circle, 150 of which are in the Aila-affected area. Almost all of them were initially affected because of link or power failure but we sent special teams and rectified most of them. About 25 to 30 ATMs are still out of order but all of them should be operational by Thursday, said a senior official of the State Bank of India.

                                                                                                               Youths loot petrol pump 
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Three youths looted Rs 2.22 lakh at gunpoint from a petrol pump on Budge Budge Trunk Road early on Monday.        
	Three youths, between 24 and 28 years, entered the petrol pump in Sarengabad on a red motorcycle around 6am and woke up the two employees in the office. According to an employee, the three wanted petrol worth Rs 60 and handed a Rs 100 note. They tied us up and demanded the keys to the locker at gun-point. Then they took the money and left.        
	The employees later informed Sanjay Ganeriwal, the owner of the pump who lodged a complaint with Mahestala police. A preliminary probe suggests the youths had been tipped off that the money was not removed from the cash box on Sunday. No one has been arrested yet.

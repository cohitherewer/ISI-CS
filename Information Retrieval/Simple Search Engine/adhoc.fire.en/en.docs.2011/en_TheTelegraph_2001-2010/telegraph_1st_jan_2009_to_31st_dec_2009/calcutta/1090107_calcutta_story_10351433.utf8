The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Nativity to Navami

  - Port wine gains popularity          POULOMI BANERJEE AND IPSHITA NANDI                  
	A clandestine Calcutta favourite is making its way from the Nativity-New Year menu to next Navamis spread. Home-made wine, a secret classic brewed and largely consumed by the Anglo-Indian community in the city, is in demand like never before.        
	Last year I sold about 100 bottles but this year it was 140, said a central Calcutta wine maker, not wishing to be named. (The making of this sweet, strong wine is an old tradition but not strictly legal.)        
	For the first time in 30 years, he has seen the demand go beyond Christmas and New Year. Quite a few of my customers have asked for a bottle or two for the pujas. I am sure to sell three times more next year. I will keep about 350 bottles ready for the period between October and December 2009, he said.        
	At Bow Barracks, the traditional hub of home-made wine, Christmas and New Year has been the conventional boom time and so it remains. The seasonal business depends on word-of-mouth publicity.         
	Micheal Chang and his sister Toni have sold over 200 bottles this winter. Toni has been making wine at home for many years now after getting the recipe from a Goan lady, said Micheal.        
	A healthy demand has seen the home-made wine seeping out of Bow Barracks to other parts of the city. But not everyone is happy about it. You can get wine makers in Picnic Garden and Elliot Road now. Last year I sold over 300 bottles but this year it has come down to around 200. The customers are getting divided, complained Micheal.        
	Chances are, the loyal customers will be back for more. After all, reputation does matter. Buyers rely on trusted sources, some of them well known in the steadily growing community of consumers, said Micheal. The buyers are mostly Catholics, but Bengalis also purchase this wine, added the Bow Barracks man.        
	The demand for the home-made variety still remains strong in the face of several wine brands entering the market primarily because it is far easier on the pocket. I sell a bottle for Rs 120. Even a cheap wine from a shop will not cost less than Rs 300. We keep our prices low as our profit margin is less, we have no transportation costs and we dont have to pay any excise duty, explained a port wine maker.         
	And its tailored to the local tongue. We add sugar to make it sweet because thats how people like it.        
	The flavour depends on the grapes, and since home brewers are dependent on the market-bought produce the quality can differ. No, its not for the wine snob. But for the happy tippler with a taste for tradition, it does just fine.

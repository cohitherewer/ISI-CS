The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Terrace towers multiply without monitor
                                                                                                               Terrace towers multiply without monitor

	Rukmini Chatterjee was about to board a bus at Esplanade on Thursday afternoon when she saw thick black smoke overhead. She looked around and found a cellphone tower atop Wool House on Lenin Sarani engulfed in flames.         
	The sight reminded her of the cellphone towers installed on the terrace of the Jatindra Mohan Avenue building where she lives despite resistance from several other tenants.        
	We were opposed to the towers being installed on top of our building on the grounds of safety but the wish of the owner prevailed, said Chatterjee sitting in her third-floor flat on Friday morning. The 40-year-old homemaker does not know who to approach for redress.         
	Her predicament stems from the lack of a single agency to determine the legality of cellphone towers on terraces across the city.        
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) provides a no-objection certificate for the structural stability of the premise on which a tower comes up. The fire department comes into picture only when there is a diesel back-up for a tower.        
	The environment department last year issued a set of guidelines for cellphone towers. The Environment Protection Act empowers officials of the department to register FIRs, issue prohibitory orders and file cases against those who violate the norms. The provisions hardly act as a deterrent in the absence of proper monitoring.        
	More than 25 per cent of the complaints we receive nowadays are related to cellphone towers. We find that most of them were installed without any permission from the local municipal authorities, said Biswajit Mukherjee, the chief law officer of the environment department.         
	According to estimates by the CMC, absence of proper monitoring of cellphone towers is putting lives of residents of more than 7,000 buildings at risk.         
	The Wool House incident was the first where a cellphone tower apparently caused a fire. We will try to keep that aspect in mind from now on, said an official of the civic body.        
	Flouting environment department guidelines, towers have come on buildings in narrow lanes and congested areas. More than 12 families reside in the building on Jatindra Mohan Avenue, where two towers have come up on the terrace in the past 18 months. In an adjacent lane, a tower has been set up on a two-storey building.        
	Just imagine the loss of lives and property the towers can cause if there is a storm or earthquake, said Swapan Saha, a resident of the second building. He, too, does not know who to approach for help.         
	The cellphone service providers attributed the proliferation of towers to their growing consumer base and claimed that they take all necessary permissions. We prefer to install towers in densely-populated areas for better coverage, said a spokesperson for a cellphone service provider.         
	For building-owners, the money offered by service providers to install cellphone towers is often the clincher.         
	A building owner who is negotiating with various cellphone companies told Metro: The rate depends on the importance or location of the building and the type of tower  it is more for main towers and less for sub-towers. I want Rs 25,000 per month whereas one of the companies is willing to pay Rs 15,000. I am going through a broker whose office is in Park Circus and who strikes such deals on behalf of mobile companies.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 26/11 effect on 26/1
                                                                                                               26/11 effect on 26/1
          A STAFF REPORTER                                          
	Make way small cars and mini-buses, the big guns are here. Anti-tank guided missiles with large BMP-II Armoured Personnel Carriers, T-72 Tanks, 105mm sealed gun and IGLA Air Defence Missile will roll down Red Road.        
	Riding a wave of patriotism in the wake of 26/11, Republic Day will be all about the might of the armed forces  from machinery (led by the Bofors 155mm sealed gun) to men (led by the Gorkha Regiment).        
	During the last Know Your Army show at Fort William, held in association with The Telegraph, we had noticed tremendous enthusiasm among the common people regarding the armed forces. This Republic Day display is sure to be special for the people of Calcutta, says Group Captain R.K. Das, CPRO (East), ministry of defence.        
	The average R-Day turnout in the past few years has been 8,000-10,000. This time, weather permitting, the figure could be closer to the 15,000 mark, felt the information and cultural affairs department.        
	Around 4,000 passes have been distributed for the show and given the heightened interest in national security following the Mumbai attacks, another 10,000 could turn up, said an official.        
	Anticipating a larger crowd this time, police have urged people not to carry bags to the parade venue. There will be strict security checks and if people turn up with bags, it will cause a delay, said Pradip Chatterjee, the joint commissioner (administration).        
	Card-holders can take a gallery seat along Red Road while others must find a place along the Brigade Parade Ground  between JK Island and Victoria Memorial  near the South Gate of Raj Bhavan (Eden Gardens end), behind the Cenotaph near Mohun Bagan ground and the road leading to East Bengal ground.        
	A 4,000-strong police force will create channels to ensure smooth flow of the crowd from all directions to Brigade Parade Ground.        
	For a sneak peek of R-Day, theres a dress rehearsal on Red Road from 9am on Saturday.

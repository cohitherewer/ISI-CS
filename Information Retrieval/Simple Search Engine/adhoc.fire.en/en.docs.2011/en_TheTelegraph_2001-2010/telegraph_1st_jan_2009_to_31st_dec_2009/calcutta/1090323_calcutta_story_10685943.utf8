	A space crunch is hampering the work of the enforcement branch (EB), the city police wing responsible for seizing fake goods.        
	The volume of seized goods has jumped in the past two years and the EB doesnt know where to store the items.        
	The quantity of seized goods has been going up since 2007 and we are facing a problem in storing them. Our godown is packed and there is hardly any room left, said an officer of the branch.        
	The department seized goods worth around Rs 3.76 crore in 2008, almost twice the value of goods seized in 2007. In 2006, goods worth Rs 47 lakh were seized.        
	We do not know where we will store the goods being seized every month. We have intimated our seniors about the problem, said another officer.         
	The EB has a godown on bank of the Hooghly, near Armenian ghat. A wide array of fake goods, from cosmetics and branded clothes to machine parts and pirated CDs, is piled up in the storage area, covering over 3,000sq ft. A constable keeps watch round the clock.        
	Metro visited the godown, inside a building owned by Calcutta Port Trust, and found it overflowing.        
	Items seized 20 years back are still kept here, said an EB officer.        
	The rulebook states that seized goods should be stored until the cases are disposed of in court.        
	After a case is disposed of, we are supposed to destroy the goods with the courts permission. We dump the goods near Dhapa, said C.K. Dutta, the deputy commissioner of the EB.        
	According to officers of the department, storage became a serious problem after fake goods started flooding the market.        
	Safety has become another concern after the seizure of a large number of gas cylinders in the past year. The cylinders have been kept on the departments premises on Ballygunge Circular Road.        
	To ensure the safety of our personnel we have now started keeping the seized cylinders in the godown of oil companies, said an officer.

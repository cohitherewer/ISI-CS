        A STAFF REPORTER                          A friend of Asha mourns the tragedy at SSKM Hospital on Wednesday afternoon. Picture by Amit Datta                                         
	Bapi ami university pouche giyechi (Dad, Ive reached the university).        
	Asha Bhattacharjee was still on a bus, just about to alight, when she texted the message to her father on Wednesday morning.        
	Seconds later, the 22-year-old MA student was flung off the vehicle and fatally injured when the driver suddenly hit the accelerator instead of halting at the designated spot near the Alipore campus of Calcutta University.        
	A fellow passenger took Asha, a first-year student in CUs South and South East Asian Studies department, to SSKM Hospital, where doctors declared her dead.         
	There were no external injury marks on her body but a test revealed she had suffered haemorrhage of the lungs.                  Asha Bhattacharjee        
	Asha, the only child of her parents, left her Kalicharan Road apartment in Behala around 9.45am and boarded a Thakurpukur-BBD Bag minibus (WB04/A-5678) on her way to the CU campus off the National Library.        
	Police said the girl was standing on the footboard, waiting to get off, when the bus slowed down on Belvedere Road in front of gate No. 2 of National Library, a few feet from the designated stop.        
	But instead of slamming the brakes, the driver suddenly pressed the accelerator. The girl lost her balance and was flung off the vehicle. She hit the road face down, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police, headquarters.        
	The driver tried to speed away but the passengers forced him to stop. He and the conductor then jumped off the vehicle and fled.        
	The bus has been impounded and we have launched a search for the driver and the conductor, Shamim added.        
	As news of the mishap spread, Ashas friends, teachers and family members rushed to SSKM Hospital. Father Ashim, who works in the Geological Survey of India, was inconsolable.        
	Asha used to text her father every morning on reaching the university. It seems today she sent the message while she was still on the bus, said S. Bhattacharya, a relative of Asha.        
	The girls friends, who blocked Belvedere Road for half an hour from 2pm demanding better traffic policing on the stretch, were seething at the road anarchy around the university campus.        
	The accident could well have been averted had the driver halted at the designated stop, yelled Monalisa Biswas, a classmate of Asha, at the hospital.         
	This is a common occurrence. Drivers and conductors insist that passengers get off while buses barely slow down. How many lives will be lost before the authorities stop this practice? she demanded.        
	Asha had studied in Nava Nalanda High School and did her graduation in political science from Sivnath Sastri College.        
	She was a bright student, said Rajagopal Dhar Chakraborty, the head of South and South East Asian Studies in CU.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Trinamul raid on lock-up
                                                                                                               Trinamul raid on lock-up
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Six drunk men who identified themselves as Trinamul Congress activists barged into Chitpur police station on Sunday night, assaulted two cops and tried to free an accused from the lock-up.         
	Cops from the adjoining barracks rushed in and arrested four of the attackers while the other two managed to flee.         
	The four in the net  all in their 40s  have been identified as Pappu Singh, Satyendra Shaw, Rajendra Shaw and Omprakash Shaw.         
	Local Trinamul MLA Tarak Banerjee admitted that those arrested were supporters of his party. I am yet to know what had happened as I was busy with some party programmes, Banerjee said.         
	Sources said all four were small traders, involved in supplying construction material or selling stationery items. They are all active workers of the Trinamul. Their job was to collect subscription from businessmen for the party, said an officer investigating the case.         
	The quartet  charged with rioting and causing hurt to deter a public servant from discharging his duty  have been remanded in police custody till August 14.         
	Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police, detective department, said the gang had come to snatch away Chandan Thakur, who was arrested in a BT Road telephone booth in Chitpur around 11pm on Sunday.         
	Thakur, who runs a stationery shop, got involved in a drunken brawl with the owner of the booth and assaulted the man. Our men went to the spot following a call from the locality, Shamim said.         
	It was around midnight when six men, all drunk, barged into the police station. They went straight to the room of duty officer Dipon Joardar, where they identified themselves as Trinamul activists and demanded that Thakur be set free immediately, recalled an officer of Chitpur police station.         
	Joardar turned down their demand, saying Thakur had been booked under a specific charge. The gang then assaulted the duty officer and ran towards the lock-up, where a constable was standing guard. The men asked the constable to open the lock-up gate. When he refused, the gang hit him so hard that he slumped to the ground, said Shamim.         
	The six then started shaking the lock-ups gate in an attempt to break open the lock. On hearing the commotion, cops from the police stations barracks rushed to the spot. Seeing the approaching contingent, the attackers tried to flee. We arrested four of them, said an officer of the police station.         
	A senior officer at Lalbazar said raiding a police station with the intention of freeing an accused was unprecedented.

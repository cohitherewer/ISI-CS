                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Police wake up to illegal parking
          A STAFF REPORTER                            Cars parked in the middle of Karl Marx Sarani last week and (below) a no-parking sign on the stretch on Sunday. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha                                 
	Vehicles had a free run of Karl Marx Sarani for the first time in a year on Sunday as cops cracked down on parking in the middle of the road following a prod from Lalbazar.         
	The crackdown began on Saturday afternoon and continued on Sunday morning. The centre of the 350m stretch outside Fancy and Five Star markets was dotted with signboards prohibiting parking. Twenty policemen looked out for those violating norms.        
	Metro carried a report on November 19 highlighting how a gang, allegedly with the help of cops, had turned the busy road into a parking lot. The racketeers used to charge more than five times the regular parking fee from visitors to the two markets.        
	We slapped spot fines on more than 20 vehicles that flouted traffic norms on the stretch. Parking is not being allowed and the crackdown will continue, said Nirmal Kumar Sarkar, the officer-in-charge of Vidyasagar Traffic Guard, on Sunday.        
	The police commissioner has ordered us to file cases against those who flout the parking rules, said another officer of the traffic guard, explaining what prompted the action against the racket, which according to residents, had been active since the tram tracks were concreted more than a year ago.         
	Residents alleged that criminals backed by the Congress and the Forward Bloc were behind the racket.         
	On Saturday afternoon, over 50 people, led by a Forward Bloc leader, put up a roadblock on the stretch to prevent the police crackdown. The protesters claimed that visitors to the two markets would face problems since there were no parking lots in the area.        
	Regular visitors, however, heaved a sigh of relief on Sunday. Its true that there is a parking space crunch. But the criminals used to extort money from motorists and harass them. They should have been arrested, said a visitor from Alipore.        
	Shop owners said they had lost customers because of harassment by the racket.

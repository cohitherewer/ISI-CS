	The number of Indian students flying off to the US for higher studies has slumped by 25 per cent during the downturn but Calcutta has fared better than the rest of the country. There has been a decline of only 11 per cent in the number of F1 visas issued to students from the American consulate in the city.         
	According to figures from the US embassy in New Delhi, while 25,863 student visas were issued in the 2008 US financial year (October 1, 2007 to September 30, 2008), 34,510 F1 visas were issued in the next 12 months  a drop of 25 per cent. In Calcutta, however, 1,394 F1 visas were issued in 2008 and 1,239 issued in 2009  a slump of 11.12 per cent.         
	I am happy that the number of students from Calcutta has not dropped recently, said Chad P. Cummins, the director of the US consulate in the city.         
	A senior official at American Center said there was a strong feeling in the consulate that more students would apply for visas from next year as the global economy picked up.         
	The US assistant secretary of state for consular affairs, Janice L. Jacobs, who is touring the city, met schoolstudents at the American Center on Thursday and encouraged them to study in the US.

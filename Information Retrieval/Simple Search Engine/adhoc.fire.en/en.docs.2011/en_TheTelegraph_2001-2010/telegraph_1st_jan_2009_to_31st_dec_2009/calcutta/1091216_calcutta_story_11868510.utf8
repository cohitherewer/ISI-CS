                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      2lakh theft in Behala home
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Cash and ornaments worth over Rs 2 lakh and two cellphones were stolen from a house in Barikpara in Behala early on Tuesday.         
	Police suspect the thieves entered the single-storey house of Prabir Kumar Das through a gap between the main door and the asbestos roof. The house is currently undergoing repairs.         
	We are trying to track the stolen cellphones, which were switched on till Tuesday afternoon. We have also spoken to the labourers working in the house and the family members, said an officer of Behala police station.        
	Das, a trader, discovered the theft around 4.30am when a noise woke him up. He saw a man clad in yellow trousers and a white shawl leaping over the boundary wall. I thought the thief had stolen bricks and iron rods, but we saw our almirah was open. Gold and silver ornaments were missing from the locker. Around Rs 10,000 and two cellphones were also stolen, said Das.        
	We think two labourers whom we had sacked for suspicious behaviour committed the theft. We have given their details to the police, Das added.        
	Das lives in the Behala house with his 65-year-old mother, his sister Pratima and her husband. The jewellery belonged to Pratima.         
	My brother had worked hard to arrange for the jewellery for my wedding in 2007. Silver utensils and ornaments that I received as gifts have also been stolen, said Pratima.        
	The police have found handprints on the wall and above the door of the house and suspect at least two people were involved in the robbery.         
	It seems the thieves knew the details of the house. We have started an investigation, said S.K. Chowdhry, the additional superintendent of police (industrial).

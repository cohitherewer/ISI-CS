                                                                                                               Next weekend you can be at...   Ghatsila
                                                                          
	A bit of history and loads of scenic beauty  that sums up Ghatsila for you. Nestling on the banks of the Subarnarekha river in Purbi Singhbhum district of Jharkhand, this picturesque small town can be an ideal getaway for all those who love impulsive, unplanned breaks.         
	Catch the early morning Ispat Express or the Steel Express in the evening and a three-and-a-half hours later you are in Ghatsila. You can also drive down.         
	As you pass through the quiet town, a few bazars, several economy-range hotels and a hilly landscape meet the eye.         
	Dont go there expecting a packed sight-seeing schedule. Just sit back and take in the serenity of the rugged terrain, and enjoy walks on the banks of the Subarnarekha or the nearby Fuldungri Hills.         
	There is a number of beautiful sites to visit in and around Ghatsila. One such destination is the Pancha Pandava Tila.         
	The tale goes that the Pandava brothers had stayed there for a while during their exile. The Dharagiri waterfalls, outside the town, are a treat for the eyes.         
	One can also enjoy an auto ride through villages to the Burudih lake and dam, located 9 km from the town.         
	The sunset is spectacular there. Dont forget to sip piping hot tea and munch on snacks from the local shacks as you watch the onset of dusk.         
	A dilapidated raj bari with overhanging creepers tells tales of lost glory. While major portions of the building lie broken and neglected, a part of the property is being used by the civil court of the town.         
	A little distance away lies Gourikunj, the former residence of Bibhutibhusan Bandopadhyay, the author of Pather Panchali. Bandopadhyay had penned several immortal works like Ashani Sanket in this house, where he spent his last few years.         
	Thanks to the initiative of the state government, the house is now well preserved and freshly painted. Nearby is a library dedicated to the author.         
	One can also take a days trip to Galudih, around 8 km from Ghatsila. Its breathtaking beauty and calmness make it an ideal picnic spot.         
	For those who would like to venture further down, the Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary (the land of wild elephants) can also be covered in a days trip. And if you are lucky, you can come across some jumbo footprints, though according to forest officials fewer elephants are sighted here now.         
	Another pleasant drive through a forested area will take you to Jadugorar Jungle, where the famous Rankini Temple (dedicated to a tribal deity) is located.         
	Not just tourists, tribals from near and far throng this temple  with a very colourful facade  for wish-fulfilment.         
	The Hindustan Copper Limited factory in Ghatsila offers you a peek inside its gates on certain days.         
	You can spot the factory right from the banks of the Subarnarekha.         
	The Ramakrishna Mission Ashram here is also a big draw. Located amid greenery and trees, the ashram embodies tranquillity.   
	Going  
	Take a train from Howrah. You can try the Ispat Express, which leaves at 6.55am or the Steel Express at 5.30pm.  
	You can also take a car.   
	Autorickshaws, rickshaws and private cars are available for travelling in and around Ghatsila.   
	Staying  
	Budget hotels are available. You can check out Bibhuti Vihar, Anandita Lodge, Hotel Akashdeep, Jyoti Palace and Hotel River View. Guest houses are also available.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Six men were arrested in Posta on Monday night and a cache of arms and ammunition was seized from them. Police said the gang had assembled at Tarasundari Park to plot dacoities in central and north Calcutta.        
	City detective chief Jawed Shamim said the leader of the gang was Israel Khan, who was wanted in several criminal cases. We seized three pistols, two country-made revolvers, six chambers, 48 rounds of ammunition and a motorcycle from them, he said. The seized arms and ammunition were manufactured in Bihar.        
	The gang  apart from Israel Khan  comprised Ashok Dey, Sattoban Sarkar, Mushtaque Khan, Amit Ray and Sukur Ali. All six have been remanded in police custody till August 4.        
	Israel is from Aurangabad in Bihar, while Ashok and Sattoban are residents of Howrah. Mushtaque and Amit are from Sodepur and Sukur from Lalgola in Murshidabad. Cops said Israel had been arrested in 2000 in connection with several dacoity cases and released on bail in 2008. He formed the gang recently, an officer said.

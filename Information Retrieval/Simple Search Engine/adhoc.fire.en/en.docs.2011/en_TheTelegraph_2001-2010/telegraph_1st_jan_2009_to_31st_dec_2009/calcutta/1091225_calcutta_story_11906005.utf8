The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Govt admits fair zone still foul
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Govt admits fair zone still foul
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen admitted on Thursday that Milon Mela was not yet ready to host fairs and said the government was considering to develop the second phase of the ground through a public-private partnership.        
	The government has spent around Rs 40 crore on developing the first phase of the permanent fair ground, off the EM Bypass.         
	You can see the ground beneath is still made of loose soil (instead of being tiled). We hardly get any opportunity to work in the winter because of back-to-back fairs, Sen told Metro after the inauguration of the Industrial India Trade Fair, organised by the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry.        
	An industry department official said it would take at least another year to ready the first phase.        
	For the development of the second phase, Sen said the government was considering the public-private partnership model. According to an official, the government does not want the second phase to be an open ground. We want to erect a concrete structure, part of which can be used commercially and the rest can host fairs, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | On road to perdition of greens
                                                                                                               On road to perdition of greens
  - Government destroys what it has but wants more                              (Top) Curzon Park has more rats than blades of grass; (above) a part of Howrah Maidan resembles a litter bin. Pictures by Pradip Sanyal                                
	Team Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee laying claim to the citys lungs is diabolical. To wrest the Maidan from the army and give the government possessional right would be to subject our only oasis to the fate of other greens it has possessed and destroyed.        
	Metro ran a check on two patches of green controlled by the government  one in the heart of the city and the other across the river.              
	CURZON PARK        
	The first thing you notice on entering Curzon Park are rats  hundreds of them scampering in and out of the holes they have burrowed. If thats not reason enough to avoid the rest of the park like the plague, walk further on the road to park perdition.        
	Litter rules the enclosures that pass off as resting places for weary legs or playing arenas for children. Iron pipes are dumped in one of the enclosures, while vagrants have taken over another section. Tarpaulin shelters, empty bottles of liquor and plastic bags strewn all around tell the story of decay and lawlessness.        
	A marble structure is in decay, bearing cracks and caked in dust. A permanent haze of dust and smoke hangs over the park, thanks to the CTC tram and bus depot. The lamp posts in the area have become urinals.        
	Its a shame that Curzon Park has been reduced to this state. I shudder to think what the authorities will do to the Maidan if it changes hands, says Shakti Ranjan Banerjee, the honorary wildlife warden of Calcutta.              
	HOWRAH MAIDAN        
	The original green oasis of Calcutta has ceased to be a maidan thanks to relentless encroachment over the past five decades. What remains of the so-called Howrah Maidan is an auditorium  constructed after felling around 50 trees  and a football stadium that green activist Subhash Dutta calls a shopping complex in disguise.        
	A road running east to west splits the maidan. On one side is Sarat Sadan, the auditorium that replaced a civil defence camp and encroached on the space once reserved for circus tents in winter. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was the guest of honour at the inauguration of the auditorium.        
	The stadium is on the other flank. The sidewalk in front is lined with shops that are part of the Howrah Municipal Corporation Market Complex. Bus, taxi, auto and cycle-rickshaw stands complete the picture of organised chaos.        
	Encroachment is the main problem, and its not as if we have never tried to solve it. But these people have been living here for decades and cannot be removed until they are given alternatives, says former Howrah mayor Gopal Mukherjee.        
	The earliest recorded encroachments on the maidan were by Howrah General Post Office, a church and the Grand Trunk Road. Such transgressions continued through the 80s and 90s, mostly by government agencies, despite green activists filing PILs.         
	The plunder of the greens is past present continuous.                    RITH BASU

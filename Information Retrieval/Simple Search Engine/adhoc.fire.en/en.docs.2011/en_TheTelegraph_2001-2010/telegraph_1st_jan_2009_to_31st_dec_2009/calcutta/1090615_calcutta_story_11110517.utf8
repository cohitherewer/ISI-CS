The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Death probe points at suicide 
                                                                                                               Death probe points at suicide 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Sleuths probing the death of Sohini Basu seem to be certain that she had killed herself.         
	Judging by circumstantial evidences, including the nature of mark around her neck, its clear the 27-year-old had hanged herself. We are trying to ascertain what had driven her to suicide, said a senior officer. The family members of Sohini, who was found lying still in the Garia house of her sister-in-law, had lodged an FIR alleging that she had been tortured to death.        
	Sohinis husband Arup Ghosh and his mother Lily, sister Indira Chowdhury and brother-in-law Rabi have been arrested.        
	On Saturday afternoon, the cops took Arup to his Garfa home in an attempt to collect evidence but failed to trace anything significant. So far we have not found anything, said additional police superintendent S.K. Chaudhury.        
	Sohinis father Amal Bose said: Around 40 per cent of my daughters jewellery was found in the house. The rest is missing. We also could not find one of her cellphones. Some neighbours of Arup tried to heckle him while he was being led into the house.

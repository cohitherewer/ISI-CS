The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Roar of invisible lion
                                                                                                               Roar of invisible lion
          TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                                    
	The Forward Bloc is using surrogate advertising to dodge the crackdown on poll clutter in Salt Lake.        
	Posters, banners and hoardings with slogans woven around the word singha (lion)  in bold red  have appeared across the township, replacing the campaign materials that have either been pulled down by the authorities or removed by the party.        
	Amader sobar-i naki singha rashi (We all share the zodiac sign Leo), reads one of the slogans. Singhe prem kore jei jon sei jon sebiche jonogon (One who loves the lion is serving the people), proclaims another.        
	Gourabdeep Bhattacharya, the secretary of the Salt Lake Club Samannay Committee and the brain behind the campaign, said he was inspired by Satyajit Rays use of the word lion in the film Joy Baba Felunath.        
	We were in a fix when the authorities ordered all campaign materials to be removed. The idea of using the Forward Bloc symbol without naming the party or drawing the party symbol struck me when we were brainstorming on how to get our message across without breaking the law, he told Metro.        
	Liquor companies have long been using surrogate advertising  the practice of promoting a restricted product through another of the same name  to circumvent the law.        
	The new set of posters and banners puzzled residents at first. I kept wondering what the slogans meant until I got the message. I think its a smart and novel idea, said Abhijit Chakraborty.        
	According to a CPM leader, the campaign is meant to educate residents about the unfamiliar lion symbol. This is the first time voters have been given the choice of electing a Forward Bloc candidate rather than one from the CPM, said Saumen Chakraborty, the secretary of the CPMs Salt Lake local committee.

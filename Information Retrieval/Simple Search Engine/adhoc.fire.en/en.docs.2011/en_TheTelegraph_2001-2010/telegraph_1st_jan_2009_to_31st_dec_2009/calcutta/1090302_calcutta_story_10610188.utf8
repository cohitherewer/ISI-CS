          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A Rajasthan resident travelling on a forged passport was arrested along with an alleged member of the racket that helped him procure the document at the city airport on Sunday.         
	Jagdish Prasad, 29, produced Harjit Singh Dhillons passport at the immigration counter for catching a low-cost flight to Bangkok, on his way to Malaysia.        
	After being detained, Prasad told immigration officials that he was travelling with Maninder Singh Rana, 29, who was standing in a queue.        
	While working as a tailor in Bhatinda, Punjab, Prasad had met an agent of the racket, who had promised to help him settle in Kuala Lumpur against a payment of Rs 1.35 lakh. The passport was handed over when Prasad paid the amount to another agent, based in Jalandhar.         
	Prasad was told that Rana, who had worked in Malaysia for two years before returning to India, would accompany him to Kuala Lumpur. Prasad paid Rana another Rs 10,000, said an immigration official in Calcutta.

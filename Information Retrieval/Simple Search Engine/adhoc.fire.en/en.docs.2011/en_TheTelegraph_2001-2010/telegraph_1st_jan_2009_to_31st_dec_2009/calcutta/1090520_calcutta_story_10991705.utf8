	Sachin Halder got back his Tata Safari on Sunday but the papers are still with the authorities.        
	The Canning trader was upset at the condition of the car which the Election Commission had requisitioned on April 23 and refused to return despite a high court order on May 4 to do so.        
	There are scratches in at least four places, including the back of the left side mirror, right door and the roof where the beacon was fitted. There is also an alignment problem with the front wheels and some other snags, said Halder.        
	The trader took the car to the companys workshop in Rajarhat on Tuesday but was asked to come back for repairs after fixing an appointment. Akash Mondal, the engineer who inspected the car, confirmed that the SUV had developed problems. It will have to be serviced in various departments of the workshop, he said.        
	I have to send the car for repairs within three months of buying it. Since the poll panel had requisitioned the car, it has run 6,000km, Halder said. He had bought the car for his wife who cannot step out in the sun because of a skin ailment.         
	The high court has asked the Canning sub-divisional officer to appear before it on May 22 in connection with the case.        
	Samir Changoiwala, whose Scorpio the poll panel had requisitioned but could not take as it had broken down, is yet to get back the vehicles tax token and his drivers driving licence which the public vehicles department had seized.

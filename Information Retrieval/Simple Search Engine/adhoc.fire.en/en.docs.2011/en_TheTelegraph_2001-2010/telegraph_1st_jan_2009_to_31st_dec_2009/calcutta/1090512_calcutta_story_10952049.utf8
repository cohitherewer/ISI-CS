The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Trees bear brunt of polls
                                                                                                               Trees bear brunt of polls
          ON THE SPOT - POLL PIERCINGS ON TREES                                  A BSP poster nailed to a tree in Padmapukur, Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee rsquo;s poster hangs from a tree on Broad Street,CPM candidate Sujan Chakraborty rsquo;s poster at   8B bus stand in Jadavpur Pictures by Talat Salahuddin                                 
	 Roadside trees are the mute victims of the current Lok Sabha polls. Banners, hoardings and flexes have been nailed to tree branches indiscriminately. And all political parties, including the CPM and the Trinamul Congress, are guilty of this green cruelty (see pictures).        
	The Election Commission (EC), seems to have overlooked this crime, and has not not banned it under the model code of conduct. And the civic authorities have taken this opportunity to go soft on fellow political dadas and didis.        
	The fact, however, remains that nailing publicity materials on trees is banned under civic rules. The civic authorities had earlier launched a number of drives against advertising agencies indulging in such acts. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) is allowing the eyesores to remain on the pretext that they are not prohibited by an order of the Election Commission.         
	Several thousand political festoons, boards and flexes have defaced numerous trees lining the city thoroughfares. From Entally, Gol Park, Broad Street, SN Banerjee Road and Padmapukur to Kalighat, Hazra and Jadavpur, all trees are covered with hoardings, which have been nailed to the trunk or branches.        
	Even in the locality of the mayoral council member (environment) Sushil Sharma in ward 65, a large number of festoons are pinned on trees. Once the election starts no authority takes any initiative without the permission of the EC. The commission has to give specific directives to the CMC and other agencies for taking action. During this period, our writ does not run, said Somnath Banerjee, the chief engineer of parks and squares.        
	According to the CMC Act, the parks and gardens wing can take action against hoardings on tress, but during elections, such drives remain suspended.        
	About 10 days ago, the Election Commission directed the CMC to remove all hoardings and flex materials from public places. Accordingly, the civic authorities pulled down thousands of hoardings, festoons and cutouts. But propaganda material nailed on trees remained untouched for they were not mentioned in the order.        
	Roadside trees are the property of the CMC and we have no objection if the civic authorities remove all the festoons from the trees. It is the CMCs duty to control this kind of nuisance, said councillor Sabita Das of ward 55. A good number of festoons and hoardings are still found on the trees beside CIT Road.        
	Environmentalistspeak: Calcutta High Court green bench passed an order in 2000 banning hoardings on trees. If someone is putting pins on trees, he or she is injuring the tree, and it will eventually die. Political parties are harming the environment by using non-biodegradable plastic and flex campaign materials and inflicting injuries on trees, said Subhash Dutta, an environmentalist.        
	Mayorspeak: I admit nailing anything to a tree is not allowed in Calcutta. The CMC hesitated to launch a drive against this during the elections as there was no mention of it in the order of the Election Commission.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | City Lights
                                                                                                                 City Lights
      Shut up and vroom                        A poster of The Motorcycle Diaries and (below) Ray                     
	Gael Garcia Bernal fans (and there are lots of them in the city!) had a date with the thinking persons sex symbol at the Oxford bookstore on Park Street as SAW came calling on Tuesday evening.     
	Shut-up and Watch Film Club, a Zee Studio initiative, turns three this month. Its first Calcutta offering (a free screening) was the Walter Salles directed 2004 classic The Motorcycle Diaries.     
	Based on The Motorcycle Diaries, the memoirs of Ernesto Che Guevara, the film traces the Cuban revolutionary leader (played in the film by Bernal) and his friend Alberto Granados journey across the continent of South America on a ramshackle Norton 500, travelling through Chile, Venezuela, Machhu Picchu and Peru, before he (Che Guevara) changed the world the world changed him.     
	The journey undertaken in 1952 may have had a profound impact on Fuser as four years later he would be by Fidel Castros side, fighting the regime of Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista. Che was assassinated in 1967.     
	Come May and Luke Kennys 13th Floor might make it to the next SAW showing. We will try to show both commercial and classic films, said Sujay Kutty, the business head of Zee Studio. Not many turned up for the Tuesday show though. Maybe we need to start the films a little later or switch to Saturday, Kutty added.    
	Ray birthday bash    
	The 88th birth anniversary of Satyajit Ray will be a grand affair. There is a party everywhere. Add to that the fact that Goopy Gyne and Bagha Byne are turning 40, when they were supposed to be ageless.     
	On Saturday, May 2, Rays birthday, Bangla Akademi hosted an event on Goopy Gyne Bagha Bynes 40th year. From May 3 Satyajit Ray Society will host programmes till May 10. The money raised from the event will be used to build a Satyajit Ray heritage centre, Arup K. De of Satyajit Ray Society said.    
	Birla Academy of Arts and Culture will host the programmes till May 6.     
	On May 3, an exhibition of still photographs taken by Ray will be inaugurated, to be followed by a lecture by poet lyricist Javed Akhtar at 6.30pm. On May 5, a Feluda and Ray quiz will be held. On May 6, a debate on the topic Bengali cinema has forgotten the heritage of Satyajit Ray will be conducted.     
	From May 7 the programmes will shift to Star theatre. Swapnasandhani will present a dramatisation of Banku Babur Bondhu on May 10.        
	Saionee Chakraborty and Kushali Nag

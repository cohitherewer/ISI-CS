The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mid-air prayers and shouts on the ground
                                                                                                               Tree Trauma in jungle city
                                              
	Trees sprawled on the  streets here, there  and everywhere was  the dominant Aila effect on  Monday.    Cars were damaged,  electric lines snapped and  traffic halted as close to  2,000 trees in Calcutta were  uprooted by the storm,  blocking nearly 100 streets  either fully or partially.  This was the highest  recorded tree fall in the  city on a single day  according to CMC records.  Fifteen CMC teams, with  five members in each,were  pressed into operation to  remove trees from  thoroughfares, armed with  some 26 axes, 30 cutters and  one gas cutter.    
	We will increase the  number of members in  each team to 10 at night to  step up operations. Monday  was exceptional, but our  target is to remove all the  trees by Tuesday morning,  said municipal commissioner  Alapan  Bandyopadhyay.  Around 600 employees  of the conservancy department,  90 lorries and two  payloaders are at hand to  remove the trees and dump  them at Dhapa.    
	The men of the moment  were the likes of Prakash  Dutta (in picture below  by Bishwarup Dutta),  whose thin frame belied  the power in those  forearms. The 24-year-old  contractual employee of  the CMC has been  chopping off thick branches  of big trees since he  was 18.    
	When I saw the sky  this morning I knew it  would be a busy day. It is  natures fury, said the  resident of Goabagan, who  works in the flower  nurseries of the CMC  when he is not chopping  trees.    
	Lending a helping hand  to the civic machinery  were the citizens groups  that have launched a clean  Calcutta crusade. A group  of 12 made a trip to a local  market for axes and saws  and then braved the storm  to clear a stretch of  Ballygunge Circular Road.    
	The administration is  short-staffed and underprovided,  so it is up to us  citizens to do our bit, said  activist Mudar Patherya.  At the end of the fourhour  tree-cutting task, the  message, again, was loud  and clear: D-I-Y (do it  yourself).

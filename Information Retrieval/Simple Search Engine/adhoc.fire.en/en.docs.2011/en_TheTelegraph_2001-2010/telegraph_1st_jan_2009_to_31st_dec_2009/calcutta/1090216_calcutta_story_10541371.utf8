	Laltu Seth, a Class VII student, was found dead in a betel nut plantation in Raipur, on the southern fringes, on Sunday.        
	The boys friends said they had sneaked into the plantation to steal. On being discovered by the owner, Laltu fell 20ft from a tree into a pond. When his family members reached the plantation, they found the body on a field.

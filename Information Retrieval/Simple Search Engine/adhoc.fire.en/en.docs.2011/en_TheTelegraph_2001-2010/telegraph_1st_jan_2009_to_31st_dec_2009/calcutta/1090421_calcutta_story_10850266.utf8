The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Export, water supply reel from power blow
                                                                                                               Export, water supply reel from power blow

	The city spent most of Monday grappling with the consequences of previous days prolonged power cuts.        
	The worst-hit were international cargo handling at the airport and water supply.        
	Cargo handling at the city airport had to be suspended on Monday night as the Airports Authority of Indias online system in the international cargo terminal crashed following power cuts in two phases  each lasting an hour. The system could be restored only on Monday evening.        
	Officials said consignments worth around Rs 1 crore were either cancelled or delayed. We had to close the operations as the entire system had crashed, said an official in the airports cargo division.         
	Sources said at least four international flights took off without any export cargo. A 12-tonne consignment that was scheduled to be ferried by an Emirates flight on Tuesday morning was cancelled.        
	We had to postpone shipment of eight tonnes of cargo which will go later this week, said Amin Khan, the general manager (east) of Singapore Airlines cargo division.        
	Water supply remained erratic in several pockets, with the residents of Behala, Kasba, Picnic Garden and Garden Reach complaining the most. The civic authorities, however, denied any shortage.        
	The power returned around 1am but there has been no water in our area since the morning. We are being forced to fetch water from a tubewell quite some distance from our home, said Subrata Majumder, a resident of Rabindranagar in Behala.        
	A group of residents of Kacchi Sadak in Garden Reach blocked Garden Reach Road for around 45 minutes on Monday morning demanding immediate restoration of water supply.        
	Police said they had received at least four complaints of snatching while the city plunged into darkness on Sunday evening. Uttam Roy had gone to the Esplanade bus depot around 7.30pm to book tickets on a long-distance bus. Someone pounced on me and snatched my cellphone. As it was dark, I could not even notice what he looked like, said Roy, one of the complainants.

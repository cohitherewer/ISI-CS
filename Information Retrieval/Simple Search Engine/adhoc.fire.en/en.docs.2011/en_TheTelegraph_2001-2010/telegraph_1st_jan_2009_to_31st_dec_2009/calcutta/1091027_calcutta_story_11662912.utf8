	At a time when most people his age were trying to beat the recession blues, Prabhu S., a 25-year-old software engineer from Bangalore, decided to undertake a bike journey across 13 states to raise awareness on issues like poverty, inaccessibility of basic needs like health, education, housing and jobs.         
	With his trusty Pulsar motorcycle and essentials like a motorbike repair kit, a sleeping bag, a first-aid kit, clothes and a camera, he started on September 29 and had already travelled to 13 states before making a days stop in Calcutta on October 13.         
	He attended a painting session at NGO Calcutta Samaritans centre in Ripon Street, where he interacted with underprivileged children. Prabhu has been speaking to the poverty-stricken at each of his stops, asking them about their problems, including the hazards of living on the pavement.         
	Part of his trip was sponsored by NGO ActionAid that works with child labourers, street children and women. In Bangalore, I met HIV-positive people who are not hindered by their ailment and hold regular jobs. But in Pune, many such people said that the ostracism they faced had taken away their will to continue, he said.         
	Rajan Mullick, who lives on a Poddar Court pavement, was awed by Prabhus adventure. I wish I could do that some day, too, he smiled.         
	Recalling his interaction with pavement-dwellers from Santosh Mitra Square, Bagbazar, Sovabazar, Rajabazar and Chittaranjan Avenue, Prabhu said: We talk of the countrys progress, yet so many people live on the streets. For the Goldman Sachs employee, the ride, that cost him two months salary, has been a long but rewarding one. His next stop in the state was Chandipur. Having covered 7,000km, he returned to Bangalore on October 19.        
	Award for city teacher                      
	Sudeshna Chakraborty was among seven teachers from West Bengal to receive the National Award to Teachers, given by the ministry of human resource development in recognition of their work. Chakraborty received the award from vice-president Mohammad Hamid Ansari at Vigyan Bhavan, New Delhi, on September 5.        
	Her name was nominated by the West Bengal School Education Department.         
	Recalled the headmistress of Jadavpur Sammilita Balika Vidyalaya: It was like a mini India, with teachers from states like Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Arunachal Pradesh.         
	Chakraborty decided in Delhi that she would donate the award money of Rs 25,000 to the non profit organisation Blind Persons Association in South 24- Parganas.         
	Chakrabortys academic journey began in 1981, when she joined Rashmoni Balika Vidyalaya, in Baruipur, as an assistant teacher. She moved on to Kamala Nari Siksha Sadan on Lake Road as headmistress in 1997. After five years there, she joined her present school in 2002.         
	Along with her administrative duty here, she also teaches physics four days a week. I will continue teaching, as it is vital to keep interacting with students, she said.         
	Chit chat
	Students shine at annual fest        
	St Augustines Day school, Ripon Street, organised its inter-school fest A-Gusto Utsav on September 12 and 14. While the offstage events like cartooning, slogan-writing and web designing took place on the school campus, off-stage events like A-Gusto Footloose and A-Gusto Sonix saw students setting the stage on fire at Mahajati Sadan (picture above by Anindya Shankar Ray).         
	 The slogan-writing contest saw students competing to write pithy messages on the recession, wildlife and technology, with Ram Mohan Dubey of Sunrise English Medium school declared the winner.         
	 The topic for the debate was celebrities should not be role models, with Sharib Tanvir of St Augustines Day School, Barrackpore, and Souradeep Ray from the host school selected the best speaker for and against the motion, respectively. Fashion designer Agnimitra Paul, who was the chief guest on Day II, gave away the awards for the offstage events. St Augustines Day School, Barrackpore emerged the overall winner.        
	Whats on your mind this week        Forget global, think local  
	When The Beatles first incorporated an Indian string instrument, the sitar, in their song Norwegian Wood they changed the direction of pop music.         
	 The popularity of music bands in our country is on the rise today. But I wish the youth would also develop a parallel liking for Indian classical music. It is unfortunate that Hindustani classical music forms like dhamar and tappa are enjoyed only by a limited section of people.         
	While every second youngster can be heard humming the songs of Bengali bands like Fossils, Cactus and Chandrabindoo, how many are aware of the beauty of ragas like Sindhu Bhairavi, Hamsadvani and Shyamkalyan?         
	 I would like the youth to open their eyes to our own musical traditions that can be as rewarding to listen to and perform as Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 94-yr-old gets pacemaker
                                                                                                               94-yr-old gets pacemaker
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A permanent pacemaker was implanted on a 94-year-old woman at a private hospital in Howrah earlier this week.         
	Shibpur resident Rajbala Kundu, a patient of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, was admitted to Westbank Hospital on April 10.         
	A chronic asthma patient, Kundu was admitted to hospital with acute chest infection. An ECG revealed a cardiac disorder. Medication failed to improve her heart rhythm and doctors decided to insert a pacemaker on April 13.         
	The patients advanced age was a problem. She also had bronchial asthma and anaemia, said cardiologist Debdatta Bhattacharya, who performed the procedure.         
	There was a risk of lung puncture and other complications. But the process was completed in 45 minutes and the patient is now recovering, said Bhattacharya.        
	Before the surgery, we conducted a blood transfusion to increase the haemoglobin count. We also treated her for the asthma, the doctor said. The procedure was carried out under local anaesthesia.        
	Rajbalas family said she was having blackouts for the past year and a half. Doctors wanted to perform an open-heart surgery but we were sceptical because of her failing health, said Rabindranath, her son. So the doctors decided to insert a pacemaker.        
	Cardiac surgeon Kunal Sarkar said the pacemaker would improve the patients quality of life. At this stage of life, quality is most important. She would not suffer any blackouts, he said.

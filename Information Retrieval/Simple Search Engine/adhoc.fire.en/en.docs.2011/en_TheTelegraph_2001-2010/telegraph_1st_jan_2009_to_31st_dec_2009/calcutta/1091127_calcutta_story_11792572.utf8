The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Students fail, scan on exams
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Students fail, scan on exams
  - CU success rates dip for   second straight year        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                        
	Calcutta Universitys overhauled undergraduate examination system has sent success rates dipping for the second consecutive year, prompting the authorities to press P for panic and probe.        
	The results, declared on Thursday, saw the pass percentages in the BA and BSc Part II honours exams decline by two to three per cent, and by four to seven per cent in the BA and BSc Part II general courses. The BA Part I honours and general examinations also witnessed a dip in success rates.         
	The downward trend is a matter of serious concern for us. Success rates in undergraduate examinations should not drop in this manner. We need to carry out a thorough investigation to find out what is wrong with the present system so that we can take proper measures and rectify the defects, if any, said Suranjan Das, the vice-chancellor of Calcutta University.        
	The 1+1+1 system was introduced by Calcutta University in 2006, ostensibly to lessen the burden on students and improve performance in examinations.        
	The 2008 results had marked a two to three per cent drop in pass percentages from the previous year. This year, nearly 12 per cent of those who wrote the BSc Part II honours exams failed to clear all papers, against 11 per cent in 2008. In BSc Part II general, a little over 42 per cent of the examinees failed to crack the test, against 35 per cent last year.        
	We had hoped that switching from the 2+1 system to the 1+1+1 system would gradually lead to 100 per cent success rates across streams and courses. But the results are moving in the reverse direction, which tells us that the 1+1+1 curriculum needs a review. We need to find out the difficulties students are facing with the syllabus and the new exam system, said a teacher.        
	Going by a preliminary analysis, there is a possibility that the number of lectures slotted for each subject in a year isnt enough to cover the syllabus. If this is confirmed, we will have to restructure the syllabus for all subjects, said a university official.        
	A section of teachers thinks that the late publication of results is another reason for poor performance.        
	Second and third-year classes began in almost all colleges before the Puja vacations. But most students were not studying seriously as the Part I and Part II results werent out till then. Their performance would have been better had the results been declared earlier, said a teacher in a north Calcutta college.        
	Vice-chancellor Das said a meeting of the universitys undergraduate council would be convened soon to discuss ways to improve academic performance. A committee will also be set up to probe the possible reasons for the dip in success rates, he added.        
	Students of BSc Part I (biochemistry honours) at Presidency College and Asutosh College claimed that their aggregates were low because their scores in one section of an honours paper werent added. University officials said they were looking into the complaints.        
	The results have just been declared and we need to check their papers to ascertain whether someone made a mistake during tabulation of marks, an official said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mishap brake on flyover
                                                                                                               Mishap brake on flyover
          A STAFF REPORTER                           The concrete block that fell at the flyover construction site. A Telegraph picture                                   
	The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has suspended work on the flyover linking VIP Road with the EM Bypass after a crane dropped a concrete block weighing at least 60 tonnes to the ground on Saturday evening.        
	The mishap spot, on VIP Road, was close to a slum where more than 200 people live. Pedestrians had also gathered to watch the cranes in action when the wires of one lifting the block snapped.        
	Senior police officers and the CMDA top brass met on Monday and decided that full-fledged work will start after the general elections, when cops can be deployed at the construction site.         
	The Rs 68-crore project was launched in March 2008 and was scheduled to be completed next March. Engineers associated with the project said it would be extended beyond November 2010 as a result of the delay.         
	We dont want to take chances. Accidents can happen at any construction site and theres no point going into a blame game. We have asked the contractors to use cranes with 125-tonne capacity so that such accidents do not recur. Each pre-fabricated girder weighs around 30 tonnes. With the powerful cranes, two such girders can be lifted at a time, said a senior engineer of the CMDA.         
	It has also been decided that the girders would preferably be lifted on Saturday and Sunday nights, when a crowd is not likely to gather at the site.         
	The police have slapped a case of negligence against the contractor and asked the authorities why they did not relocate the slum dwellers before starting work, said a senior officer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tax students to pay teachers 
                                                                                                               Tax students to pay teachers 
                                          
	On February 25, the state government had accepted the recommendation of the Fifth Pay Commission and increased the salaries of its employees, including the teachers and non-teaching staff of aided schools. The order, with retrospective effect from April 2008, was implemented on April 1, 2009.        
	According to rules, private schools  even those that do not receive any grant from the state coffers  have to pay their employees on a par with government or aided educational institutions.        
	The affiliating authorities too think that the salaries of the teachers of private schools should be same as that of government schools. This has prompted all private schools to raise the student fees, sparking protests by parents. Metro examines the issue        
	Reason for raising fees        
	Private schools depend entirely on students fees. So they claim they have no option but to hike the fees to raise money for the revised salaries of their teachers and other employees.        
	The quantum of hike in the salary        
	The basic pay has been raised by 32 per cent. The dearness allowance will be 16 per cent of the revised basic pay and the house rent allowance 15 per cent of the basic pay subject to a monthly ceiling of Rs 6,000.              
	The hike in the initial pay of school employees        
	 Trained matriculate teacher: From Rs 3,350 to Rs 8,840        
	 Trained (BEd) graduate teacher: From Rs 4,650 to Rs 12,750        
	 Trained graduate (honours) teacher: From Rs 5,500 to Rs 14,930        
	 Postgraduate teacher: From Rs 6,000 to Rs 15,960        
	 Group D employee: From Rs 2,600 to Rs 6,600        
	What did the school managements do?         
	Reputable schools such as Don Bosco, St Xaviers, La Martiniere, Loreto, South Point, Mahadevi Birla, St James and Pratt Memorial follow the same pay scale as government schools. But there are several private schools affiliated to Delhi boards that hire incompetent teachers who they force to accept a lesser pay scale than the governments, in violation of rules.        
	Since the reputable schools cannot afford to compromise on the quality of teachers, they have to follow the revised pay scale. The compulsion, the schools claimed, has left them with no option but to raise the students fees. The hike ranges from 50 to 80 per cent.              
	Protest pockets        
	Guardians are protesting the hike across the city. But the reputable schools are less affected than the ones where the hike seems to be steep considering the social-economic profile of the parents.              
	Governments role        
	The government has appealed to the schools to be judicious and reasonable as it does not have any authority to order a roll-back.

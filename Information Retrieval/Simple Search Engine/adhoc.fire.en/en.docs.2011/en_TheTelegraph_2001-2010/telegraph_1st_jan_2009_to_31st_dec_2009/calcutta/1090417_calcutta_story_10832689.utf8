          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Five control rooms have been set up for the state joint entrance examinations, to be held in three sessions on Saturday. Over 1,09,000 students, about 40,000 of them from outside the state, will compete for nearly 30,000 engineering and 1,200 medical seats.         
	For the first time, a hologram has been embossed on the pictures of the candidates on the admit cards to prevent impersonation.        
	No candidate will be allowed to take the examination without an admit card sporting the hologram, said Siddhartha Dutta, the chairman of the board.         
	Personnel at the control rooms in Calcutta (9831969448, 9874577700 and 9836367274), Durgapur (9874177700), Kalyani (9874377700), north Bengal (9874277700) and Midnapore (9874677700) will answer exam-related queries of students. The city control room will also address queries from candidates in South 24-Parganas, Howrah and Hooghly.        
	The Durgapur control room will cover Burdwan, Birbhum, Bankura and Purulia. Students in Nadia, North 24-Parganas and Murshidabad can contact the Kalyani control room. The north Bengal and Midnapore control rooms will take up queries from students in the respective regions.

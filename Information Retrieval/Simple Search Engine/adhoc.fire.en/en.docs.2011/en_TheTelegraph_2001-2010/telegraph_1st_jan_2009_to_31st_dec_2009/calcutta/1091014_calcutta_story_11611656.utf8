                                                                                                               Cops protest against boss
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	About 400 constables of Calcutta polices Eight Battalion staged a demonstration on Tuesday to protest their boss deputy commissioner Pinaki Ranjan Mondals alleged misbehaviour with the wife of a colleague.         
	The demonstration was started at the battalion office on BT Road, near Cossipore, around 11.30am by constables who were to join the afternoon shift and continued for two hours. Protesters said Swapan Pal, a constable who had suffered two cerebral attacks recently, had turned up at the office with his wife Sheela around 11am to meet Mondal and seek an extension of his medical leave.        
	My husbands right leg was somehow injured and started bleeding. The deputy commissioner was furious to see drops of blood on the floor and asked me to wipe them off, said Sheela. Mondal was not available for comment.

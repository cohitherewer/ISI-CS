          OUR BUREAU                              
	Hindustan Motors can supply 700-800 Ambassadors to be used as taxis every month from September. The government, however, is still considering allowing taxi operators to go for alternative vehicles.        
	At the rate of 700-800 cars a month, it would take at least nine months to replace the 6,355 taxis that come under the purview of the high court ban. Since we cant wait that long we are considering whether cars of other brands could be allowed as taxis, an official in the transport department said on Friday.        
	The operators are pressing for Tata Indica, Maruti-Suzuki Omni and WagonR as taxis.        
	The chief general manager of Hindustan Motors, Dipak Munshi, and some other officials of the company told transport minister Ranjit Kundu during the day that they could supply only up to 700-800 Ambassadors every month.        
	The company officials told me that low demand had prompted them to go slow on producing Ambassadors that can be used as taxis, Kundu said. On the operators demand that they be allowed to choose from other brands as well, Kundu said: Its under consideration.... All I can say now is we dont want to encourage monopoly (of Hindustan Motors).

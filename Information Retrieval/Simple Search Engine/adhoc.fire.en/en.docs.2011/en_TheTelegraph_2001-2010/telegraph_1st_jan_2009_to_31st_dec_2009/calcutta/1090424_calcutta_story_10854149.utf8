The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Plea to save inmate with knife inside
                                                                                                               Plea to save inmate with knife inside
          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                          Amarendra Nath Ghosh. A Telegraph picture                                  
	The Presidency jail authorities are planning to move court for permission to operate on Amarendra Nath Ghosh, who had swallowed a knife to prevent his extradition from Germany to stand trial in bank fraud cases.        
	Ghosh and his associates had allegedly duped city branches of Allahabad Bank, Bank of Baroda, Punjab National Bank, United Bank of India and Andhra Bank of Rs 27.69 crore in 1994-1995.        
	He fled to Germany after being booked for criminal conspiracy, criminal breach of trust, cheating, falsification of accounts and criminal misconduct.        
	Ghosh has been lodged in Presidency jail since being brought to the city from Munich in August 2007. He has refused to undergo surgery.        
	Ghosh developed some complications recently and is under the observation of jail doctors. We are preparing a report on his condition that will be submitted in court. We will plead for permission to operate on him, said an officer of Presidency jail.        
	There will be a human rights violation case against us if he dies with the 10cm knife in his abdomen. The surgery needs to be done and we have informed our bosses about it, added the officer.        
	According to him, a layer of skin has grown over the knife lodged in the colon, adding to the complications.         
	It is very important that the knife is removed. We need to get the surgery done after getting a nod from the court, he added.         
	A senior official of the jail department said a medical board would be set up to examine Ghosh if the court gives permission for the surgery.        
	Doctors treating Ghosh at the jail hospital said the surgery, though risky, is vital for his well-being. His condition might deteriorate suddenly if the knife is not removed, said a doctor.        
	B.D. Sharma, the inspector-general (prisons), said it was a matter of concern that the knife was still in Ghoshs abdomen. Ghosh is under the observation of doctors and we will do whatever is needed, he said.         
	Ghosh was brought to Delhi from Munich in 2007 by a team of CBI officials, two surgeons and an anaesthetist on a special aircraft equipped with medicines and surgical implements.         
	The German authorities ordered Ghoshs extradition in April 2003 but he moved the constitutional courts against it. When his pleas failed, he swallowed a knife and refused to undergo surgery, delaying his extradition.        
	The German authorities finally handed him over to the CBI on the condition that he be flown to India on an air ambulance.         
	In 2007 when Ghosh was produced before the CBIs special court he claimed that he had no problems living with a knife inside him.         
	I know how to live with the knife. I can take it out whenever I want to by performing a set of asanas, the former resident of Kasba had said soon after arriving in the city from Munich.

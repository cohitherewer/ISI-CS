The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Speed guns gather dust as toll mounts
                                                                                                               Speed guns gather dust as toll mounts
          PRONAB MANDAL                          A speed gun on a city road. A Telegraph picture                                  
	The speed gun has ceased firing though casualties on city streets continue. More than 70 people have died of road mishaps till date this year.        
	The drive to rein in rogue drivers with the help of speed-assessing gadgets lost steam just two months after it was launched in June 2008 amid fanfare. In 2009, they havent been used even once.        
	The drive started with six speed guns. A few more were bought  each gadget costs a lakh  around 10 days ago. A source in Lalbazar said all were lying dust-covered in a room in the traffic department.        
	Records at Lalbazar show the drive against speeding vehicles was carried out extensively in the first two months and over 400 errant motorists were booked.         
	In the next three months, the pace slowed down and only 100 drivers were penalised. Since January, no drive has been carried out.        
	Dilip Banerjee, the deputy commissioner of police (traffic), admitted that the drive with speed guns came to a halt two months ago. He blamed it on inadequate manpower and lack of infrastructure.        
	We need more speed guns and a separate team to act against speeding motorists, he said.        
	In June 2008, police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti had announced that speed guns would be installed on strategic roads and at crossings to curb rash driving.        
	Earlier, speed limit norms were enforced only on the EM Bypass. But Chakrabarti said the enforcement would gradually be extended to 85 roads across the city.        
	Boards mentioning speed limits for various vehicles were put up on various roads. Police issued details of penalties and fines for errant motorists.        
	An officer of the traffic department, however, said: Keeping a tab on vehicles on 85 roads with just six speed guns is next to impossible. Before launching the drive, we should have been provided with adequate number of speed guns.        
	Speaking about the lack of infrastructure, the official said keeping an eye on the Bypass was a tough task. This stretch connects Ultadanga in the north to Garia in the south. It is also the gateway to Sector V and New Town. At least three teams, armed with speed guns, should be deployed on the artery simultaneously. Our present set-up does not allow us to carry out an elaborate surveillance, he explained.        
	Without speed guns, its impossible to implement speed limit rules, say traffic sergeants. How can I assess the speed of a car zooming past me without a speed gun? If I stop the car, I do not have evidence to book it for flouting speed norms. If such a rule has to be implemented, there should be a speed gun at every crossing, he said.

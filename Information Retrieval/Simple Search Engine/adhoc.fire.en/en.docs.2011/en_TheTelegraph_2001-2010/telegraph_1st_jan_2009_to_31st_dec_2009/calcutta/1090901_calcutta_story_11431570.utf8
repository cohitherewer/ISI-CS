The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Techies protest push to BPO 
                                                                                                               Techies protest push to BPO 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Over 60 engineering graduates protested outside Tech Mahindras office in Salt Lake Sector V on Monday morning after the IT service provider offered to place them in the BPO division instead of the technology division as promised.        
	We received our joining letters in December 2007 and were supposed to join in August 2008. Our joining date kept getting postponed since July and now the company is going back on its word, said a graduate of the Bengal Institute of Technology.        
	The recruits said they received an email last Thursday with an offer to join their BPO division for an annual package of Rs 60,000 to Rs 70,000 instead of joining as technical associates with an annual salary of Rs 2.9lakh as promised during recruitment.        
	We have been trained as engineers, why should we work in the BPO division, that too, for just Rs 5,000-Rs 6,000 per month? said a graduate of the BP Poddar Institute of Technology and Management.        
	Over 5,000 students were recruited by Tech Mahindra from campuses across the country in 2007 and another 1,500 in 2008. Of them, 3,500 have not been absorbed yet.        
	We did not anticipate the downturn when we hired the students more than a year ago. We reduced the number of recruits to 1,500 in 2009 as we had such a huge bench, said Colonel L.K. Bhatia, the vice-president (resource management) of Tech Mahindra.        
	The BPO offer is open-ended. Those who dont want to join can always wait till some other opening comes up, Bhatia said. The students rued that given the market condition, they didnt even have much hope of landing another job.

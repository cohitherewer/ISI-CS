	The lobby against genetically modified (GM) crops has found another spokesperson. Film-maker Mahesh Bhatts latest production is a 30-minute documentary on the evils of GM food, which was launched at the Birla Academy of Art and Culture on Friday.     
	GM food, promoted by US-based companies like Monsanto and Sengenta, is made from crops that have been genetically engineered to add or suppress specific traits. Examples are soya bean, corn and cotton seed oil.     
	Poison on a Platter tried to show how harmful BT cotton, the only commercially available GM crop in India, is and warned of the possible long-term consequences of genetic modification.    
	The screening was followed by a panel discussion featuring Bhatt, Ajay Kanchan, the director of the film, food policy analyst Devinder Sharma and Ardhendu Sekhar Chatterjee, the founder-member and president of Development Research and Communication and Services Centre.     
	The idea of the documentary came to Bhatt when he and Kanchan were in Assam for the screening of their film on philanthropist Haaji Ajmal Ali. Devinder happened to be there. When we heard him out, we felt that this was an issue that deserved to be talked about, said Bhatt.     
	Dance fest    
	Held over four days and in its sixth edition, Nritya Sangam, a festival of dance, came to Calcutta for the first time this year. It was organised by Sangeet Natak Akademi, New Delhi, the government of West Bengal and Anjika, a city-based dance institution. This time we are celebrating dance and all its forms and not just focusing on the conventional forms, said danseuse Priti Patel of Anjika.     
	The venue saw performances of little-known forms. Anupama Kylash from Hyderabad performed Vilasini Natyam, a form that evolved from the operatic and ritualistic legacy of Andhra Devdasis. She depicted Satyabhamas emotional states as she fell in love with Krishna.     
	Navtej Singh Johars experimental performance had influences of everything from Bharatnatyam to avant garde and free style contemporary, on the final day. It also saw another less-known form, Gaudiya Nritya, by danseuse and Fulbright scholar Mahua Mukherjee whose performance depicted Dasamahavidya, or the 10 different facets of Durga or Shakti.

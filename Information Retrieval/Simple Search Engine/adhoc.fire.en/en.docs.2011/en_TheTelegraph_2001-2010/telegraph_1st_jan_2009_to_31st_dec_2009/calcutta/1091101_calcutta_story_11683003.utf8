	If the AC need not be switched on, can winter be far behind? For many Calcuttans, baked by the summer heat, winter is a time to rejoice  to eat, drink and be merry, without drowning in sweat. Here are 10 reasons to look forward to the Calcutta winter this year.         
	1. Winter means Christmas and New Year parties that take over the city. More shopping. More discounts, hopefully. More clubs, restaurants, hotels, lounges. The open-air New Year parties are the best things about winter, says homemaker Mita Chakraborty. Its also a time when you can have white rum without feeling like a pressure cooker. Cheers!         
	2. Winter weddings are looked forward to as much as the Christmas and New Year parties. I love attending open-air wedding receptions on the Tolly Club grounds in winter, smiles advertising executive Sanchari Ghosh. Its the time to don your heavy silks, be it a designer panjabi or a Valkalam sari. The best part? Make-up stays put.        
	3. Winter in Calcutta means dozens of fairs and exhibitions. Okay, many of them look like each other, but Lexpo, a few handicrafts exhibitions and of course the Book Fair mobilise huge populations to move towards the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass.         
	4. Calcutta loves its food  even more so during winter. biryani, chaap, rolls, nolen gurer sandesh, plum cakes... Wait, theres going to be more. This winter, the citys food stop range will expand further with a number of new entries, the chief among them being another McDonalds outlet and a speciality restaurant called Masekkah in the newly-opened City Centre II at New Town. Also on the anvil are new KFC, Pizza Hut, Subway and Cream amp; Fudge Factory outlets across the city.         
	5. Looking forward to spending a lot of time at the multiplexes this winter? Then you will be spoilt for choice. Coming up in December is the eagerly awaited Bollywood film  Aamir Khans 3 Idiots based on the Chetan Bhagat bestseller Five Point Someone. Hrithik Roshans Kites, the Amitabh Bachchan-Ben Kingsley starrer Teen Patti and Ranbir Kapoors Rocket Singh-Salesman of the Year are the top picks this winter.         
	Hollywood goes bigger and better this December with Titanic director James Camerons $300-million magnum opus Avatar. And for Tollywood film buffs, there is Sandip Rays Hitlist.         
	6. Winter is sometimes when you go on family picnics without complaining.         
	7. The evening nip in the air, followed by the cloud of mist that descends on the city every morning, often staying put till the middle of the day. The mist may give rise to smog, but in winter, nothing looks prettier than the mist-covered Maidan in the early mornings, says Mita, a regular morning walker at the Calcutta landmark. Sipping piping hot tea from an earthen cup doesnt make you feel hot. Blowing out steam from your mouth on a particularly cold morning or taking a horse ride on the Maidan is also permitted to adults.         
	8. Bring out all the woollens, count them, shake your head and buy some more. Useful tip: Fashion pundits tout black as the colour of the season, followed closely by blue. Leggings in all colours will continue to be huge. This winter, its all about accessories. So reach out for those dangling earrings and your makeup box. Lose weight. Doll up.         
	9. Clutching on to the well-aired and sun-dried quilt. Nothing can beat snoozing on a cold winter morning with the quilt drawn right up to your ears. Its pure bliss, smiles college student Rashmi Roy. So is listening to the unusual music of the quilt-menders.         
	10. To top it all  a match at Eden Gardens. The ground will host an India-Sri Lanka ODI on December 24, its first big match involving national sides in two years. Have you got your tickets?

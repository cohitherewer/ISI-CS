                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Govt admits school code failure 
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The school education department on Friday admitted in the high court that it had failed to carry out a judicial order on corporal punishment delivered five years ago.        
	The division bench headed by acting Chief Justice B. Bhattacharya issued a fresh order asking the director of school education to call a meeting of all 19 district inspectors of schools during the Christmas vacation and ask them to execute the order.        
	The high court in 2004 had asked the director to issue a notification banning corporal punishment to all school heads. But the schools in only nine districts have received the order yet.        
	Pratik Dhar, the lawyer for director Dibyen Mukherjee, told the bench on Friday: My client had tried his best to inform the schools about the order through the district inspectors of schools (DIS). But many inspectors have failed to carry out the order.         
	In response to an earlier order, the heads of Andal Girls High School and Mominpur Vidyapith, where two students died after being subjected to corporal punishment last year, attended the court.        
	Justice Bhattacharya asked them to ensure that such incidents did not recur.        
	The 2004 order had also stated that if corporal punishment led to a students death, the guilty teacher would be tried under IPC Section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), which carries a life term.        
	Such teachers are usually tried for death due to negligence (Section 304A), punishable with two years in jail.

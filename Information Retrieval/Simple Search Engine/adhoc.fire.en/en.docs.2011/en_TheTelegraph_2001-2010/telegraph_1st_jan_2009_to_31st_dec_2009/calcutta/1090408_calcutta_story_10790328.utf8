The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Trapped trio die in blaze
                                                                                                               Trapped trio die in blaze
  - Fire in illegal glue factory next to Belgachhia LPG godown          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Three men were charred to death after being trapped in an illegal adhesive factory that caught fire on Tuesday afternoon.        
	Fire brigade personnel battled the blaze in Belgachhia for three hours, desperate to keep the flames from spreading to the adjacent LPG godown stacked with cylinders containing around 8,000kg of gas.        
	A stray spark could have caused those gas cylinders to burst, leading to many more casualties, divisional fire officer Bibhash Guha, who was at the site, told Metro.        
	The victims of the blaze were identified as Kala Chand Das, Madhusudan Kundu and Sujit Majumdar. All three were workers of PS Industries, which owns the factory.         
	Three others  Dharma Raj Pandit of Raja Manindra Road, Arup Kar of Murshidabad and Mohanto Mondal of Basanti  were admitted to hospital with burns and other critical injuries.         
	Police arrested the owner of PS Industries, Sushanta Kundu, late in the evening on charges of operating the factory without a fire licence and proper safety measures.        
	An illegal paint factory located around 25 metres from the airport was gutted in a fire on March 23. Nicco House, a landmark of the citys business district, caught fire just four days later. There was, however, no casualty in either incident.        
	Fire minister Pratim Chatterjee said the Belgachhia blaze was the result of blatant disregard for fire safety norms. A forensic team has visited the site and we hope to receive a comprehensive report in two-three days.        
	More than 50 small units manufacturing products ranging from plastic toys to shoes stand alongside the burnt factory on the premises of Belgachhia Rajbari, a zamindar-era property that has become an industrial estate.        
	The owners of the building were unavailable for comment.        
	Montu Das, a resident, said he heard a blast around 4.40pm and rushed out of home to enquire what had happened. By the time I reached the estate, flames had engulfed the adhesive factory and people were scurrying to safety, he recalled.         
	According to the police, there were 15 to 20 people in the factory when the fire broke out.        
	The three men who died were in the workshop and didnt stand a chance of coming out alive, a source said.         
	Apart from inflammable chemicals and adhesives, the 600sq ft workshop had a broiler and several gas burners.

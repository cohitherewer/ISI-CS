                      Artists stance against trade                    Aproject led by Experimenter along with a group of five artists, SEZ Who? explores the impact and rationale of setting up Special Economic Zones in India. Unlike a typical exhibition, it brings into the gallery environment a kind of activism-based collaborative project. This environment transforms every week to finally realise its end by creating settings and experiences of SEZ-like conditions for viewers. The larger objective of doing such a project is to create SEZ construction-like situations and thereby sensitise viewers and open new points of view on the physical transformations and emotional challenges of human dislocation. Led by Tushar Joag, artists Prajakta Potnis, Sharmila Samant, Justin Ponmany and Uday Shanbag formed a fact-finding team and spent five months travelling, researching and interacting with locals in areas around Mumbai that have been proposed to be demarcated as SEZs. They documented notes, interviews, events, protests and attended rallies. Then, they responded in the coded language of their art to envision this project and extract an opinion on the issue with support from viewers. Interestingly, the viewer plays the most crucial part in the project. As SEZ Who? matures, over its duration, the role of the viewer enhances, with increased viewer participation and interaction.                  Event: An activism-based collaborative art project When: Till July 29 (except Sunday); 11.30 am - 7.30 pm Where: Experimenter, 2/1 Hindusthan Road

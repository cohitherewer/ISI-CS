                      Calcutta rocking                    Rock music in Calcutta has followed a long tradition of western and westernised music being played at night clubs and dance clubs. Lounge acts, including swing bands, were popular in the 1950s, followed by rock-n-roll from the mid-1950s by its English-speaking and westernised urban young audience. Of late, the citys elite clubs have spawned rock bands of their own, who have managed to establish a distinctive identity in terms of sound and style. But, familiar as they may be within the citys club circuit, these young musicians remain unknown to the rest of the citys avid lovers of Western music. To provide a platform to the citys youth to showcase their talent, Vodafone, in association with t2, hosts Rockstar, the citys first ever inter-club rock music competition. Being participated by 12 rock bands representing seven of the citys high-profile clubs, it gives band members all the exposure they need to kick-start their career in rock music. Judged on the basis of song selection, band co-ordination, rhythm and style, six among these teams have made it to the finals of the contest and will be battling it out tomorrow to win the coveted title of Rockstar. The contenders: Black Rose (Tollygunge Club), Realignment 2 Reality and Eternity (both Dalhousie Institute), Purgatory and Ashes in Flames (both Calcutta Club) and, the winner between the teams Blowing Blues (Saturday Club) and Tube Screamers (Calcutta Punjab Club), who are tied with equal points. Also featuring guest performances by Professor Bertie DSilva and Supersonics.                    Event: Finals of Rockstar, an inter-club rock music competition When: Tomorrow; 5 pm onwards Where: Dalhousie Institute

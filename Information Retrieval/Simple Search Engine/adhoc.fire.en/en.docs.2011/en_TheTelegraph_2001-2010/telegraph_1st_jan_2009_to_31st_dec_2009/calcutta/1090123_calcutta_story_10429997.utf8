The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Subhas in taxi tantrum
                                                                                                               Subhas in taxi tantrum
        A STAFF REPORTER                      Subhas Chakraborty at the taxi-meter testing centre                                 
	Subhas Chakraborty blew his hat when his trusted taxi brigade turned against him on Thursday, prompting him to storm out of a meeting and cool his heels on a stool for 15 minutes.        
	The transport ministers meeting with a group of 50 taxi union leaders in the conference room of Salt Lake stadium ran into trouble when they objected to the new taxi-meter testing centre at the same venue.         
	The taxi operators argued that the fee of Rs 320 was too high and the location inconvenient for most. This centre is 12km from the motor vehicles departments office. The fee too is unreasonable, said Tarak Nath Bari, the secretary of the Calcutta Taxi Association.        
	Chakraborty was not prepared for this display of dissent, and it showed. He left the room in a huff, plonked himself on the stool and did not utter a word till he left the stadium 15 minutes later.        
	The taxi operators main grouse is that they werent consulted before the transport department made it mandatory for all taxis to get their meters tested at the centre. They also dont approve of the company chosen by the department to run the testing centre.        
	The taxi operators accused Chakraborty of giving the contract to the Bhagwandas Group without looking at other options. A spokesperson for the private company declined comment.        
	Apart from the decision to make meter testing mandatory, the operators are dissatisfied with the governments incentive package for owners of taxis that are 15 or more years old and have to be replaced by March 31. Around 7,000 of the 42,000 taxis plying in the city need be replaced in accordance with a high court order.        
	The minister stuck to the package he offered us in December  Rs 45,000 as exchange discount from Hindustan Motors, Rs 30,000 as sales tax waiver and the rest in bank loans, said Bimal Guha, the general secretary of the Bengal Taxi Association. Earlier in the day, Chakraborty had a tough time convincing bus and minibus operators to follow the court order to phase out vehicles more than 15 years old.

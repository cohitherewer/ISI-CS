The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | City centre choked by protest, rally 
                                                                                                               City centre choked by protest, rally 
          A STAFF REPORTER                                                The snarl on Lenin Sarani on Monday afternoon. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta		      
	Daylong protests and a religious procession choked traffic in the heart of the city on Monday.         
	Around 1,000 protesters assembled on Lenin Sarani, near the KC Das crossing, around 12.30pm and held a demonstration blocking the road for over four hours.         
	The protest resulted in the peak-hour traffic being reduced to a crawl in the heart of the city. The traffic snarl on Lenin Sarani spilled beyond Moulali and on Chittaranjan Avenue, said an officer of the traffic department.         
	Later in the day, protesters put up blockades at Phoolbagan, Moulali, Taltala, CIT Road and near the Park Circus seven-point crossing for over half an hour. Traffic on several stretches was diverted but that did little to ease the congestion.        
	Entire Lenin Sarani was closed following the demonstration, leading to bottlenecks on Mahatma Gandhi Road, CR Avenue, AJC Bose Road and several other thoroughfares, the officer added.        
	Vehicles started moving on Lenin Sarani around 4.50 pm but it took hours to restore normality on the affected stretches.        
	Commuters had a tough time negotiating through protests and a religious procession that started at Tiljala and wound its way through No. 4 Bridge, Moulali, JL Nehru Road, BB Ganguly Street and AJC Bose Road before returning to the point of origin.        
	It took me over two hours to reach my office in the BBD Bag area from my Beleghata house. On an average weekday it takes 45 minutes to an hour, said Atanu Das, 42, who had to get off his bus at Moulali and walk to the central business district.        
	Trouble awaited 60-year-old Amit Basu, a retired schoolteacher, and wife Ujjala when they reached Esplanade from Howrah, on the way to their daughters house on CIT Road, in the afternoon.         
	We got scared seeing so many people on Lenin Sarani. We have no clue how to reach our daughters house, said Basu, a resident of Howrah.

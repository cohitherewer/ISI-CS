The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Man who made our pandals go pop
                                                                                                               Man who made our pandals go pop
  - Forever, Michael          ARKA DAS                                                            
	Back in 1985, in a neighbourhood off Gariahat Road, Kali puja was the coming-of-age festival for many. Not because there was still no ban on crackers. But because in the early November chill, the puja committee would host a breakdance competition late into the night. Those who were surreptitiously listening to Thriller and Bad at home for fear of parental censure were that night free to play The Way You Make Me Feel really, really loud. And yes, moonwalk to it.        
	Michael Jackson was Dangerous  he made our puja pandals go pop.        
	For a decade and more, in the city of Rabindrasangeet and Bollywood beats, pop meant MJ and his song and dance spelt a kind of forbidden thrill.        
	He was the Amitabh Bachchan of music. The driver at the wheel loved his moves and the babus son in the backseat loved his music, smiles Abhijit De, a manager with a multinational company, who remembers the Navami night in 1983 when Thriller was first played in his para puja pandal.         
	Musician Vikramjit Tuki Banerjee confirms how the Jackson effect continues to vault socio-economic boundaries. We play numerous shows in rural Bengal, in places where theres no electricity. The moment we step out of the car, they look at us and say, Dekh, dekh, Jackson! They may not know our Prime Minister, but they sure know who Michael Jackson is!        
	The MJ magic went way beyond his music, with Thriller spawning a full-fledged underground fashion scene, with curled, shoulder-length locks, drainpipe trousers/jeans and those famous Jackson boots, from Park Street to Paikpara. Youngsters here, there and everywhere would break into breakdance and the pelvic thrust soon became a Bollywood trademark.        
	For guitarist Sumit Bhattacharya, 33, Thriller  the first western music album bought by him and banned by his grandfather  changed his life. Till then, I wanted to be a cricketer, but Thriller made music cool. So cool that Sumit now handles a full-time job in Mumbai and flies back to play with his Calcutta band.        
	Singer Anita Basu Mallicks MJ mania took her one step further. I saw Michael Jackson perform live in Paris, in 1992. I was only 12 years old, but I remember every mad, hysterical moment.... It was like magic.        
	For a generation of Calcuttans, MJ was like magic  he taught them to just Beat It.

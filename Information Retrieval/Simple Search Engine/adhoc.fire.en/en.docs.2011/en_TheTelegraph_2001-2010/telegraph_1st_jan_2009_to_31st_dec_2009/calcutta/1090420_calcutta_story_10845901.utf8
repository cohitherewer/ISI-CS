The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hunger strike in jail over IPL 
                                                                                                               Hunger strike in jail over IPL 
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Kevin Pietersen in action at Cape Town on the first day of the second season of the IPL. (AFP)                                  
	Around 250 undertrials at Alipore Central jail launched an indefinite hunger strike on Sunday afternoon demanding cable connection for the TV sets on the premises so they could watch IPL matches.        
	A jail officer said the inmates had raised the demand on Saturday, the inaugural day of the tournament being held in South Africa.        
	The authorities refused. In protest, the undertrials in the three wards went on a hunger strike while lunch was being served on Sunday.        
	Each ward of the jail has a TV where the inmates can only watch programmes aired by Doordarshan. The IPL matches are being telecast live on Sony Max.        
	The officer said two of the prisoners had manhandled a guard after the authorities stuck to their decision.         
	The guard was pushed and abused by some of the prisoners. An inquiry is on, he said.        
	B.D. Sharma, the inspector-general (prisons), termed the inmates demand unjustified.         
	I have heard about the hunger-strike but the issue is absurd and the demand unjustified. The inmates should remember that they are in a jail and not in a five-star hotel, he said.        
	Sharma said that only undertrials, not convicted prisoners, had joined the strike. We will not accept the demand even if the undertrials continue with their protest. Security has been stepped up to avert any untoward incident, Sharma added.

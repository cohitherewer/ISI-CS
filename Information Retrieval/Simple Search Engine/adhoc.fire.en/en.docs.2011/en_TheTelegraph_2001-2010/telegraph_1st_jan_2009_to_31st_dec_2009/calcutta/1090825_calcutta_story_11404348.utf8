The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | State roots for water tax
                                                                                                               State roots for water tax
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Funds from the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission will dry up if the state does not impose water tax on the intended beneficiaries, state urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said on Monday.        
	Many of our projects are getting stuck as municipalities, including the CMC, do not charge water tax. If the tax is not introduced we wont be entitled to funds from the central scheme, Bhattacharya said.        
	The minister got support on the issue from unlikely quarters  the Trinamul Congress, which had opposed water tax.        
	Trinamuls Sougata Roy, junior minister for urban development in Delhi, said after meeting Bhattacharya: While applying for funds under the scheme, the state had agreed to introduce a water charge. The commitment should be kept.        
	Roy said the Centre could allot up to Rs 3,220 crore to Bengal under the scheme till 2012. But the state has till date utilised only Rs 1,394 crore.

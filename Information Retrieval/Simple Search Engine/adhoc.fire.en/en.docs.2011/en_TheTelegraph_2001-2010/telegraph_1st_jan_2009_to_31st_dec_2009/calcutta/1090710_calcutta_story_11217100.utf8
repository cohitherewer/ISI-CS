          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Speeding vehicles claimed two lives in the city and Howrah on Thursday. An unidentified cyclist aged around 50 years was knocked down by a bus at the crossing of Drainage Canal Road and East-West Road in Howrah at 7.15am and a 10-year-old girl was crushed by a lorry in the Port area later in the day.         
	After the first mishap, a mob tried to set the bus on fire but police prevented them. The driver was arrested and the bus impounded.         
	An officer of Bantra police station said: A preliminary probe indicated the bus was moving at high speed. He said the driver would be produced in court on Friday.         
	The police said the cyclist was crossing the road when a private bus on route 72 hit him, killing him instantly. Local residents nabbed the driver and beat him up. They pulled out some seats from the bus and set them ablaze. Traffic flow was hampered on the stretch for nearly half-an-hour as a mob surrounded the policemen demanding stern action against the driver.         
	Later in the day, Priyanka Shaw was crushed under the wheels of a lorry on Hyde Road in the Port area. She was declared dead at SSKM Hospital.         
	The accident took place around 3pm when Priyanka was trying to cross the road. A goods-laden lorry hit her and she fell down and was crushed by its rear wheels.         
	She lived in a nearby slum and was returning home after fetching drinking water. The driver of the lorry failed to slam the brakes in time, said an officer.         
	When some local youths chased the lorry, the driver jumped off the vehicle and fled. The police have traced the owner of the vehicle and are looking for the driver.

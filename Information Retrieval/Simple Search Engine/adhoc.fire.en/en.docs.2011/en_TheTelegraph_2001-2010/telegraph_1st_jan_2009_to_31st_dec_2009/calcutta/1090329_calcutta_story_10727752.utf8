	Here is a Brit who loves the Ramayana. So much so that he travelled from east India to Sri Lanka through unknown bylanes in bus, train, motorbike and microlight, almost recreating the journey in the epic. And in the process he experiences an epiphany, witnesses a death, passes through a war zone and survives.         
	Martin Buckley is an Indiophile who has been visiting this country for 25 years, ever since I was a university student. He was at the British Council in Calcutta on Wednesday with his book An Indian Odyssey, a product of his experiences in India.         
	Buckley read out excerpts from Odyssey. The first passage was on his erstwhile Bengali landlord, a Mr Chatterjee, who was also his senior colleague at Business India, where Buckley worked as a sub-editor. What surprises and amuses Buckley is Chatterjees pompousness at office and his stinginess at home.         
	A light passage read out with a lot of action and drama complete with the Indian accent at the right places, it tickled the funny bone of the motley audience.         
	So did the second selection, which was about Buckleys encounter with an army major posted in Kashmir for counter-insurgency operations. It is through such dialogues, meetings and encounters that Buckleys journey unravels contemporary India, which is juxtaposed with its past, Buckleys own version of the Ramayana.         
	Buckley, who has read the epic in all its versions, finds Valmikis edition raw, erotic and bold.         
	While the crowd at British Council heard that without a murmur, we hope Buckley will restrain from airing his opinion to the saffron brigade.        
	War warning        
	Salim Must Die is a sequel to Lashkar and a prequel to The Dust Will Never Settle. Mukul Deva, a retired armyman who has taken to writing almost anything from cinema to self-help books and currently war thrillers, was in town to promote his second book of a four-volume series.         
	The bomb blast at Sarojini Nagar market in New Delhi and our governments knee-jerk response set me thinking and I wrote the first volume in the series, Lashkar, said the author, who believes that the insurgency in the neighbourhood will soon manifest itself in more sinister forms like chemical and biological warfare. And this wont be a few people getting anthrax letters but will be on a larger scale, he warns.         
	So be prepared. But how?

                                                                                                               Tension over witness murder
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Residents of Belilious Road and Jolapara Masjid Lane observed a bandh on Wednesday to protest Tuesday nights murder of Sheikh Jainul Abedin Khan, allegedly by criminals he had caught and deposed against in a rape case.        
	Belilious Road residents Wasim Quresi, 26, and Wakil Quresi, 28, out on bail in the rape case, and three others walked into a local club where 43-year-old Khan was playing cards, slashed his throat with a chopper and fled, said witnesses.        
	The duo, accused of raping a 12-year-old girl in 2006, had been threatening Khan for over a year and a half.        
	No one has been arrested in connection with the murder. Senior police officers and combat forces are patrolling the area.        
	A mob had damaged six shops and set fire to them after the murder.        
	Niraj Kumar Singh, the superintendent of Howrah police, said: A preliminary investigation indicates the man was killed for giving witness against the murderers in a rape case.        
	The police said Khan had seen Wasim and Wakil dropping off the girl in a motorcycle after they had raped her in an abandoned house on East-West Road.        
	Khan chased the duo, caught them and confined them in a club before handing them over to the police, said a resident.        
	Wasim and Wakil were released on bail after two months and had been threatening Khan since. Even in the face of constant threats, he deposed against the two on January 14, said another resident.

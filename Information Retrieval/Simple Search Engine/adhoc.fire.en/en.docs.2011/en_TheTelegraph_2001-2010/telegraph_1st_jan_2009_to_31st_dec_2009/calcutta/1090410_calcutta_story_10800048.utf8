          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Schoolgirl Bithi Roy was allegedly raped and murdered by four teenagers who ganged up against her for ditching them, police said.        
	Rintu Das, Abhijit Roy, Sanjay Adak and Amit Bose were arrested from their homes in Howrah on Wednesday night on the basis of circumstantial evidence and information provided by the 15-year-old victims friends. Sanjay, 16, was identified as the sender of the threatening text message that was found on Bithis cellphone.         
	The message was about Sanjays affair with a girl and how Bithi was allegedly trying to spoil that relationship.        
	Sanjay, a Class IX student of Kona High School, and Madhyamik examinee Amit, also 16, have been remanded in judicial custody for a week. The other two boys will be in police custody for the same period.        
	Rintu, 18, is a Class XII student of a school in Kadamtala and Abhijit, also 18, works in a factory.        
	Samir Kumar Dey, the director of public prosecution, said Sanjay and Amits family members had been asked to produce proof of the boys age in court. If they are found to be minors, the duo will be tried in the court of the Juvenile Justice Board.         
	An investigator said Amit had confessed to calling Bithi to a desolate spot by a lake near Kona railway station around 6pm on Tuesday to ask her why she had ditched him. Abhijit, Rintu and Sanjay reached the spot later. They too had an argument with her before committing the crime.        
	According to a doctor who had assisted in the post-mortem, Bithi was raped by more than one person before being hit with a sharp weapon and strangled. The police, however, have not pressed a rape charge on the boys. They have not confessed to raping her and we havent received the post-mortem report yet, a police officer said.        
	Bithi, the daughter of a factory worker, had left her home at Kona Chowdhurypara around 5pm on Tuesday for a stroll with three friends.

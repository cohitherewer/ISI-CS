	Two youths who had threatened to kidnap two children if their family did not cough up Rs 8 lakh landed in a police net on Thursday afternoon.        
	Cops picked up Somnath Yadav and Vivek Singh, both in their mid-twenties, from a spot near a Kidderpore hotel after tailing a teenager the duo had sent to collect the money from a representative of the Bahetis of New Alipore.        
	Somnaths father, police said, has been supplying milk to the Bahetis for years. The youth had studied till Class XI in a prominent south Calcutta school.        
	Somnath lives with his wife in Kalighat. He hatched the extortion plot with his friend Vivek, said Damayanti Sen, the deputy commissioner of police, detective department.        
	Sleuths have learnt that Somnath had visited the Baheti house with his father Santosh a couple of times and knew some members of the family.        
	He said that during his interaction with the Bahetis, he had collected their phone numbers and also the number of their driver, said an officer working on the case.        
	A week ago, the driver received a call which the sleuths said had come from Somnath. The caller threatened to kidnap the two children  students of classes IV and V  if the family did not pay him Rs 8 lakh.        
	Sree Ram Baheti, an uncle of the kids, immediately alerted the police, who advised the family members to tell the extortionist that they were willing to pay up.        
	Somnaths second call came on October 12 on the cellphone of Sree Rams sister-in-law.        
	The youth told the woman to bring the money  in cash  to a place near a hotel off Diamond Harbour Road in Kidderpore on Thursday afternoon.         
	He told the woman to come alone and warned her against alerting the police.        
	The woman, shadowed by some policewomen in plainclothes, turned up at the designated spot carrying the cash in a black handbag.        
	A teenager soon approached her and asked for the money. When she asked him about the kidnap threat calls, he said he was collecting the cash on behalf of two youths who were waiting for him down the road.        
	As soon as the teenager left the spot with the womans bag, the cops started tailing him.        
	After a five-minute walk, our team spotted Somnath and Vikek and rounded them up, said an officer.

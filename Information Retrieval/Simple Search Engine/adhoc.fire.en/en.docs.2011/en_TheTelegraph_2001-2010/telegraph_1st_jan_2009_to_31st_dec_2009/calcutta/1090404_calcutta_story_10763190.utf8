The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tests prove tamper truth
                                                                                                               Tests prove tamper truth
  - 85 per cent of taxi meters found faulty        A STAFF REPORTER                                                  
	More than 85 per cent of the taxi meters tested in the past fortnight have been found to be tampered with, confirming why Calcuttas yellow fleet saw red the moment proper meter-testing was made mandatory.        
	Four out of six taxis failed the meter-fitness test on the first day itself and the trend has continued, said a technician of Bhagwandas Vehicle Testing Services Pvt Ltd, which runs the authorised testing facility at Salt Lake stadium.        
	The nearly 1,000 taxis that have undergone meter tests there since March 17 are all registered in Howrah and Barasat. Not a single vehicle registered with the Calcutta public vehicles department (PVD) or the Alipore regional transport authority has even entered the Salt Lake testing centre.        
	Going by our records, more than 5,000 taxis whose certificates of fitness have expired havent reported for fresh meter tests because the agitating unions have asked them not to, an official of the public vehicles department said.         
	According to conservative estimates, a taxi is hired 10-12 times daily on an average. If 85 per cent of the 45,000-odd taxis in Calcutta and its adjoining areas run on tampered meters, it means nearly 4.5 lakh people are being cheated each day.         
	Three taxi owners and drivers associations had moved the high court on Tuesday, challenging the transport departments authority to get meters checked by a private agency twice a year, against a fee. The single-judge bench of Justice J. Biswas refused a stay on the notification.        
	The taxi unions have now decided to appeal to a division bench for a stay.        
	What is the guarantee that the machines installed at the testing centre have not been tampered with? Moreover, it is unfair that a taxi driver from Barrackpore or Howrah has to travel all the way to Salt Lake stadium to get a meter tested, said Bimal Guha, the general secretary of the Bengal Taxi Association.        
	So, will the union continue to prevent taxi operators from visiting the centre? We will not stop any taxi from going to the centre now that the court has endorsed the notification. We will only appeal in court, an office-bearer claimed.         
	Bhagwandas Vehicle Testing Services, which is running the Salt Lake facility on a build-operate-transfer basis, has set up six computerised meter-testing machines.        
	Taxis failing the test are given a fortnight to get their meters calibrated and go for a second check. We also remove the meter seal from taxis with tampered devices, a technician said.        
	The standard operating procedure of unscrupulous taxi drivers or owners is to first hack the meter password, alter the distance that needs to be covered for every rupee to be added to the fare and/or shorten the waiting period before the meter starts ticking.        
	They would never get caught earlier because the PVDs system of checking meters was an eyewash and the nexus between the checker and the checked quite obvious.        
	Taxis with fudged meters have not been able to bluff the computer, though.

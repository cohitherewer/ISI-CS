                                                                                                               Extortion whiff in trader attack
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Three bike-borne youths fired at a 42-year-old nursery owner in Rajarhat on Friday morning but the bullet missed Noor-e-Alam by a whisker.        
	I was sitting in my shop when the trio came on a motorcycle and fired at me. On seeing one of them take out a firearm, I dropped to the ground and the bullet missed me, said Alam. Police suspect the three were extortionists but Alam refused to say whether he was threatened to pay up.        
	As news of the firing spread, residents blocked Rajarhat Road near Dasadrone School to protest lawlessness in the area. The situation was controlled after police intervened and assured the protesters of prompt action against the accused.        
	In the afternoon, Mohammad Sayeed, in his late 20s, was injured in his right hand when Sheikh Anwar Hussain allegedly shot at him in Karaya.         
	The police said Sayeed was walking down a Kasiabagan road, under Karaya police station, when an armed Hussain started chasing him. He pulled the trigger and the bullet grazed Sayeeds hand, said an officer of the anti-rowdy section. On hearing the gunshot, residents started chasing Hussain. They caught up with him and alerted the police.        
	It seems to be the fallout of a rivalry, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters).         
	Electrocuted: The body of a man in his 30s was found beside an electricity feeder box in the Hastings area early on Friday. Police suspect the man was electrocuted while trying to steal cables.        
	Milk to cost more: The price of milk from the state dairy will rise from September 11, milk commissioner U.S. Nandi said on Friday. The price of cow milk will be Rs 21 per litre instead of Rs 20, double toned milk will cost Rs 18 a litre instead of Rs 16.50 and Janata milk will be priced Rs 16 a litre instead of Rs 14.50.        
	Trainee teachers held: Two leaders of the students association of the Primary Teachers Training Institutes (PTTI)  Pintu Parui and Mohammed Afrafil  surrendered before a Salt Lake court on Friday. They were wanted for the August 12 vandalism that left five cops injured and public property damaged. An FIR was lodged against 24 members, of whom 12 were arrested. Parui and Afrafil were granted interim bail.        
	Trains cancelled: Some trains will be cancelled or rescheduled because of maintenance work at Burdwan station. A pair of Howrah-Burdwan main line locals (M219 Up and M230Dn) will remain cancelled between August 31 and September 4. Also a pair of Howrah-Burdwan chord line locals (C255Up and C268Dn) will start from and terminate at Masagram from August 31 to September 4. The Up Udayan Abha Toofan Express will leave Howrah at 11am, instead of 9.45am, on September 6.        
	Jeweller arrested: A jeweller, believed to be associated with a group of snatchers, was arrested on Elgin Road on Friday night. Cops learnt about the jeweller from two youths who were arrested in connection with a snatching reported by a Salt Lake resident.

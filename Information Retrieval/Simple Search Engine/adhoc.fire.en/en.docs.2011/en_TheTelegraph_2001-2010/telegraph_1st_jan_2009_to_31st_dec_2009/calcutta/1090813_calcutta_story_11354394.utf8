The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 11 trainee teachers arrested
                                                                                                               11 trainee teachers arrested
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Eleven members of the Primary Teachers Training Institutes (PTTI) Students Association were arrested on Wednesday after a clash with police outside the state primary education boards office in Salt Lake.         
	A number of cops and protesters were injured and RAF had to be deployed to bring the situation under control.        
	The agitating students said they wanted an assurance from the government that they would be considered for recruitment to the 56,000 vacant primary teachers posts in the state.        
	The police said the agitators tried to barge into Acharya Prafulla Chandra Bhavan, which houses the state primary education board and meet school education minister Partha Dey.         
	They broke the barricade in front of the building and hurled bricks at us. Six policemen were seriously injured, including Bidhannagar sub-divisional officer Subhankar Bhattacharya, said a cop.        
	Eleven agitators were arrested. The injured policemen are under treatment, said Debabrata Das, an additional superintendent of North 24-Parganas police.        
	Officers said police resorted to a lathicharge when the protesters started damaging police and government cars.        
	We only wanted to meet the minister but the cops beat us up mercilessly, said Pintu Parui, the secretary of the association. According to Parui, 37 students were injured.        
	Parui accused the government of inviting fresh applications for vacant posts while ignoring PTTI students.        
	In 2008, the Supreme Court had derecognised 142 PTTIs in the state for not following central norms. More than 30,000 students were affected by the order.

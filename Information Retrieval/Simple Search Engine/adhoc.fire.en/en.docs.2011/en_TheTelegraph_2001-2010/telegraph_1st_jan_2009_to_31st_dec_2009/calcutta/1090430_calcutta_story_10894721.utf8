The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Patels live from one hearing to next 
                                                                                                               Patels live from one hearing to next 
          RITH BASU                          Rajnis Patels parents Munni Devi and Manoj at their Bhowanipore home on Wednesday. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                  
	The Patels of Bhowanipore lost their only son Rajnis in 2003. Now, the only thing they care about is attending the court hearings in the hope that one day all the five doctors who they hold responsible for their sons death would be brought to book.        
	Rajnis Patel, then 17 years old, had fractured his shinbone after colliding with another fielder during a cricket match. He died after undergoing five surgeries in four months at SSKM Hospital. The West Bengal Medical Council has found the surgeries were performed by junior doctors.        
	The registration of two senior doctors  Dilip Majumdar, under whom Rajnis was admitted, and Debabrata Banerjee, a resident medical officer of SSKM Hospital  was cancelled on Tuesday, after six years of hearings.         
	A doctor whose name is struck off the medical councils registry cannot treat patients in a private chamber or in clinics and hospitals. He can, however, appeal to the secretary of the state health department against the verdict. He can also appeal to the council, but case cannot come up for hearing before six months of the date of verdict.         
	Other cases relating to Rajniss death are pending in the Alipore court and before the state and national consumer disputes redressal commissions.         
	Our lives have changed completely. We eat simple and dont care about what we wear. We dont attend any social functions. It doesnt even matter to us if it is warm or cold outside. We just want to be in court for the next hearing, said Munni Devi, 40, Rajnis mother, her voice soft yet firm.        
	Manoj Patel, Rajniss father described him as a Shoaib Akhtar fan who had modelled his bowling on the Rawalpindi Express. He was very tall and had a good physique. He was also interested in modelling. But he left us before he could realise any of his dreams.         
	Sitting outside their one-room house, Munni Devi recalled how the doctors would get angry every time they enquired about Rajniss condition. They kept saying we had nothing to worry about, that no one died of a shinbone fracture. I fought my fears and trusted them. Doctor toh bhagwan hotey hain! (Doctors are supposed to be like God), she said.        
	But Rajniss condition worsened. After five botched surgeries he was drained, mentally and physically, said Munni Devi.        
	My brave boy used to cry on the hospital bed and would keep asking us what was going on. We had no answers as the doctors didnt tell us about what happened in the previous surgery and why the next one was needed, she said.

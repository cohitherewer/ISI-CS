The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Inspectors to scan colleges
                                                                                                               Inspectors to scan colleges
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	A group of inspectors will monitor undergraduate colleges of all streams from this year, state higher education minister Sudarshan Ray Chaudhury announced on Friday.        
	The inspectors, drawn from academicians and experts in various disciplines, will examine the infrastructure, academic performance, financial records and other aspects of private and state-aided institutions offering courses in science, arts, commerce, technology, medicine and law.        
	Colleges directly under the state governments control, such as Presidency and Maulana Azad, will be exempt from the scan.        
	The government will take the findings of the inspectors into consideration while finalising grants for the institutions, said the minister.        
	The government had last year announced plans to set up an inspectorate in the wake of complaints against undergraduate colleges.        
	Ray Chaudhury said the body would not have any permanent official. The education department will select the inspectors and inspections will be held whenever necessary.        
	Currently, universities inspect affiliated colleges but cannot probe financial irregularities and take necessary action. Hence, universities only check things like the syllabi being followed by colleges, admission norms and the teacher-student ratio.        
	The minister was speaking at the symposium, Education in West Bengal, the Road Map Ahead, organised by the Merchants Chamber of Commerce.

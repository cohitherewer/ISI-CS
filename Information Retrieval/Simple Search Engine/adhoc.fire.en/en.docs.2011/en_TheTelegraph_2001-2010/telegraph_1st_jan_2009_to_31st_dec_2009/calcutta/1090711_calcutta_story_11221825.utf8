The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fares up, phase-out tussle on
                                                                                                               Fares up, phase-out tussle on
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The state government on Friday agreed to the transporters demand to raise the fares of buses, minibuses and taxis, following the recent hike in fuel prices.        
	The two sides, however, failed to prepare a roadmap for the phase-out of old commercial vehicles by July 31.        
	We have agreed to hike the fares, possibly by this month. Details will be worked out later, transport minister Subhas Chakraborty said after the meeting at Netaji Indoor Stadium. For taxis, the transport department agreed on a hike of Rs 2 for the initial 2km, taking the minimum fare to Rs 22. We are satisfied with the revised fare, said Tarak Nath Bari, of the Calcutta Taxi Association.        
	On the phase-out, Swarnakamal Saha of the Bengal Bus Syndicate said: The government stuck to its stand. We stood our ground. We will move the high court, and if needed the Supreme Court, seeking a stay on the ban on commercial vehicles more than 15 years old.        
	The transporters have called an indefinite strike from July 22 to protest the move to enforce the phase-out order of the high court.

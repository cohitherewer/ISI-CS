	Many of us still believe that astronomy is a science. But I dont believe that astronomy is science        
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, doing a George W. Bush, on Tuesday morning.        
	Not once, but thrice, the chief minister said astronomy when he meant astrology, at the inaugural function of the 36th Jawaharlal Nehru National Science Exhibition for Children 2009 at Salt Lake stadium (picture above).        
	With more than 500 school students, teachers and officials of the National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT) in attendance, the chief guest put his Kolhapuri-sandal foot in his mouth, repeatedly.        
	The faux pas forced the chief minister to issue a small clarification later in the evening, when at Writers Buildings he told reporters that he had meant to say astrology but had said astronomy by mistake. He went on to stress that he did not consider astrology a part of science and so had always stayed away from astrologers.        
	On the Salt Lake stage, Bhattacharjee was not reading out a prepared written speech, but was referring to some points he had jotted down on a piece of paper. The chief ministers speeches are either prepared by the state information and culture department or by the chief ministers secretariat. Occasionally, the chief minister takes the DIY (do-it-yourself) route.        
	For this programme, the chief minister had told us that he would prepare the speech himself, an official of the information and culture department told Metro.         
	Some would say the speech writer was star-crossed.         
	Bushisms              
	Who could have possibly envisioned an erection... an election in Iraq at this point in history?        
	They misunderestimated me.        
	Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we. They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we.        
	And they have no disregard for human life.        
	General, I appreciate the fact that you really snatched defeat out of the jaws of those who are trying to defeat us in Iraq.              
	Hiltonisms                        
	Gordon Ramsay! (when referring to UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown)         
	London is my favourite city. But I havent been to England yet.        
	No, Ive not heard of a pint, what is that? Is it beer?        
	Walmart... do they like make walls there?        
	Essex? Whats that?              
	And a Mamataism                    
	Ebar keu norbe na. Ami Jana Gana Mana Adhi gaibo. Eta khub important gaan. (No one move. I will sing Jana Gana Mana Adhi. This is a very important song).        
	Mamata Banerjee, before singing the national anthem, at the Trinamul Congress rally in Metro channel on November 9

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Neglect toll on showpiece stadium
                                                                                                               Neglect toll on showpiece stadium
                                          
	State sports minister Subhas Chakraborty wants to develop a sports complex on the Maidan while the Salt Lake stadium  the biggest in the country and the second largest in the world  in his own backyard lies in a mess. Metro took a walk in the 76.4-acre compound, set up in 1984 for Rs 35 crore, and saw blatant signs of neglect.              
	Missing railings        
	Iron railings have been stolen from the fence around the stadium compound. Morning-walker Subhojit Chakraborty said he had often seen thieves cut railings, load them on mini-trucks and flee towards Ultadanga.         
	Gaps in the fence allow vagrants to sit behind bushes and trees in the compound and drink and take drugs.        
	The stadium authorities chose to play down the problem. We cannot always stop drug addicts and alcoholics from entering the premises since they are armed with razors and knives, said a 45-year-old guard.        
	According to the authorities, the 35 guards manning the stadium carry only sticks.         
	Timber thieves        
	Gaps in the fence also serve as invitation to thieves who cut trees inside. Metro found five trees that had recently been chopped.        
	More than 100 trees were recently cut for the construction of a pollution testing centre near the stadium. If the authorities keep their eyes shut, the greenery around the stadium will soon vanish, said Anamika Halder, a resident of IA block.        
	The authorities claimed to be unaware of timber theft. We allow poor residents of the area to collect twigs and branches but no trees have been cut, said the caretaker.        
	Lax policing does not help. Calcutta police look after the EM Bypass while the stadium is under the jurisdiction of state police. This at times creates problems, said a senior police officer.        
	Garbage dumps        
	Heaps of garbage line the stadium ramp as well as both sides of the primary entrance to the main stadium block. Garbage was also dumped beside vats and at the foot of signboards prohibiting people from throwing waste in the area.        
	Thousands of children and elderly people visit the area daily to play or jog but the authorities simply refuse to remove the garbage, said Snigdha Karmakar, who accompanies her seven-year-old son to a football camp on the premises.        
	Construction materials block several ramp entrances.        
	The authorities should beautify the water body on the premises (Tarani Majhir Ghat). It is getting filthier by the day, said Rohit Bansal, a young footballer.         
	Ovens and bamboo        
	Bamboo sticks used to build temporary structures to put up 5,000-odd BSF jawans during elections are still lying on the premises. The holes drilled in the ground to fix the bamboo sticks have not been filled.        
	The makeshift ovens the jawans built have not been broken and the ground levelled. The same thing happens when the premises are rented out for marriages, said an official of the West Bengal Mountaineer Adventure Foundation, which has an office in the compound.               
	Official word: We have started erecting a brick wall around the stadium and have taken up other developmental activities.        
	The greenery is well-maintained and we have also started removing the bamboo sticks. The garbage will also be cleared, said an administrative official of the stadium who declined to be identified.

	Sagarika Bhattacharjee who allegedly murdered husband Bapi in their Howrah Kamardanga home on Monday afternoon was detained by neighbours when she returned to the area on Tuesday and handed over to police.        
	The 28-year-old was arrested and produced in the chief judicial magistrates court. She was remanded in police custody for five days.        
	Eleven-year-old Moloy Bhattacharjee had seen Sagarika walk out of the couples bedroom in haste leaving his brother Bapi, a labourer, lying senseless on the floor. A noose fashioned out of a piece of cloth was found next to the 23-year-old.The boy called his father Debu Bhattacharjee who works at a Kadamtala factory. By the time he rushed home, Bapi had died.        
	Early on Tuesday , Sagarika walked into a meat shop in the area and asked owner Tapan Porel how Bapi was. He called the neighbours who took her to Jagachha police station. Bapis mother Gouri had lodged a complaint against her with Dasnagar Investigation Centre on Monday night.        
	Relatives said the two married last January after a brief affair. Sagarika had three cellphones, one of which she left behind in her in-laws house on Monday. A man called up at night demanding to speak to her, said an officer.

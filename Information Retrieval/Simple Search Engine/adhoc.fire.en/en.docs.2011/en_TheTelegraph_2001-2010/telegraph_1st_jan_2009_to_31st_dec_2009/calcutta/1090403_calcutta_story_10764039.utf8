The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | First ban for flout of rally rule on greens
                                                                                                               First ban for flout of rally rule on greens
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          A Metro report on the DYFI rally in December                                  
	The DYFI, the youth wing of the CPM, will not be allowed to hold another rally on the Maidan, the local army authorities told the high court on Thursday.        
	In a 15-page report placed before the division bench headed by Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya, the custodian of the precious patch of green explained how DYFI supporters had violated court orders during its December 20 rally on the Maidan.         
	This is the beginning and I hope the army authorities take such tough measures against other violators as well, said green activist and petitioner Subhash Dutta.        
	The Telegraph has been running a campaign for years to stop the mauling of the Maidan by rallies.        
	The state secretary of the DYFI, Abhas Roychowdhury, said he was not aware of the report. We do not know of this development yet and so we will not react, he said.        
	Parking, cooking and digging are not allowed on the 100-acre green space following a September 28, 2007, high court directive. Going by the same order, rally organisers are supposed to restore the Maidan to its pre-rally state and violators are not supposed to be given permission to hold any more rallies on the Maidan.        
	The DYFI is already facing a contempt of court case in the high court. On February 9, 2008, the bench had asked it to show cause why contempt proceedings should not be initiated against it.        
	Besides giving the DYFI marching orders, the army authorities have also expressed their reservations on allowing political rallies on the Maidan.         
	It is felt that mass rallies result in environmental degradation of the Maidan (particularly the Brigade Parade Ground) and make this area, which is stated to be the lungs of Calcutta, unhygienic, said the report, which also assessed the extent of violation during the CPMs February 8 rally.         
	During both these rallies on the Brigade Parade Ground, the organisers violated the guidelines laid down by the high court, said the report.        
	The army report stated that violation of norms laid down by the court during the rally prompted the authorities to ban the DYFI. Though the CPM rallyists also violated norms, they cleaned up the mess under pressure from the army and hence were given a cleanliness certificate.        
	The preparations for the (DYFI) rally commenced on December 17, 2008 Temporary camps were established near the Babughat and Mohun Bagan grounds and use of open ovens was resorted to by the DYFI, said the report.        
	The DYFI had carried out parking of vehicles on the greens of Maidan in direct contravention of the court orders, added the report.         
	According to the army report, which the court had asked the authorities to submit during the hearing of the case on February 9, 2009, the rally organisers did not restore the Maidan to its original condition despite being given three chances.         
	So, the army authorities did not issue a cleanliness certificate to the DYFI and the security deposit of Rs 20,000 was not returned to the organisers.

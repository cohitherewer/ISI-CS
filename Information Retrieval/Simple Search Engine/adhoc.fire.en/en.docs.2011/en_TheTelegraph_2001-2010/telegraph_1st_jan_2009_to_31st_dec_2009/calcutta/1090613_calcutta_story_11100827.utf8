The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Woman in net for bank loan fraud
                                                                                                               Woman in net for bank loan fraud
          SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE                              
	A 27-year-old woman who allegedly headed a racket that used to defraud people by offering them loans from a prominent private bank at low interest rates was arrested on Wednesday night.        
	The racket, with offices near airport gate No. 2, Dum Dum cantonment and Madhyamgram, claimed to be an associate of the bank, said cops.        
	Sumitra Talukder was held on the basis of complaints by Sodepur-based garment traders Indrajit Ghosh and Sujit Barua. According to investigators, members of the racket used to call up people on their cellphones offering loans. They then collected address proof, identity proof and other documents from those who took up the offer. They asked for a photocopy of the statement of any of my savings account and a blank cheque drawn on that account for signature verification, said Barua.        
	The imposters wrote cancelled on the cheque in front of the trader on June 6 but allegedly erased the word later and tried to withdraw money using it. Barua became suspicious after talking to officials of the bank branch where he holds the account on which he had drawn the check.        
	Officials at the branch advised me to immediately issue a stop payment notice on the cheque and I did that. On June 10, a bank official informed me that the cheque that was taken from me only for signature verification was deposited for transfer of funds to the account of the racketeers, said Barua.        
	He alerted his friend Ghosh, who had also agreed to hand over a blank cheque to the same group.        
	The same evening, when Sumitra visited Ghoshs house to collect the cheque, he informed the police.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Dupe drama unfolds
                                                                                                               Dupe drama unfolds
          TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                              
	Over 400 employees of dud IT firm INFOGEN Global, after losing their jobs and deposit money, have learnt that their company had taken a bank loan of Rs 25 lakh and duped them into standing as guarantors. They now face the prospect of having to cough up the entire amount plus interest.        
	The employees came to know of this when they visited the Amtala branch of Union Bank of India  where they have salary accounts  earlier this week.        
	It was a bolt from the blue. We had gone to the bank to check the companys financial condition. But the manager said we all owed the bank Rs 25 lakh, said Arindam Ganguly, who joined INFOGEN last July. Since October, we havent receive a single rupee. On being asked, our bosses blamed it on the downturn, he said.        
	In November, company officials allegedly asked 400-odd employees to sign on some papers and even threatened to withhold future pay cheques if they didnt oblige them.        
	We had no idea the company was making us guarantors or that we would have to repay the loan ourselves, cried Ayan Biswas, another employee.        
	A senior official of the branch confirmed the matter.        
	The employees came to us and told us how they were duped. I understand their problem, but I am powerless to help them. The employees will have to pay back the amount with interest since they had signed the papers, said the official, requesting anonymity.         
	Police have found the company had only 29 paise in another account with a private bank in Salt Lake.        
	The trainees and employees have written to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee seeking an appointment.        
	As the INFOGEN horror story unfolded, the Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority set up a committee to carry out door-to-door checks on all Sector V firms. The committee will ensure that each company has a valid trade licence, said authority chairman S.A. Ahmed.         
	Members of the West Bengal Information Technology Services Association fear there are more dud firms in the sunshine sector. The government should prepare a database of placement agencies to break their nexus with colleges and IT firms, said Somenath Bhattacharya, the secretary of the Citu-backed tech union.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cops to tap old sources
                                                                                                               Cops to tap old sources
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Lalbazar wants the anti-rowdy officers at the police stations to take the help of their predecessors to improve intelligence gathering.         
	Recent crimes, such as the shooting at Mehndibagan that killed an 11-year-old and the series of snatchings outside banks, have prompted the Lalbazar directive, said sources.         
	According to them, the police authorities feel that the transfer of anti-rowdy or anti-crime officers who had served more than three years at a police station before the general election in May (in compliance with poll rules) has hampered intelligence gathering.        
	The new anti-rowdy officers have failed to develop sources in unfamiliar areas leading to a spurt in crime.         
	Those who were anti-rowdy officers in their previous posting have been asked to introduce the current incumbents to their sources and help them in intelligence gathering in other ways.        
	The assistant commissioners, who oversee a cluster of police stations and the functioning of the anti-rowdy officers, will co-ordinate the process and report to the divisional deputy commissioners, said a source.        
	The firing on September 23 in Mehndibagan, off Park Street, indicates that officers had no information about new criminals in the area. The fact that some youths opened fire over a minor incident, killing a boy, is a sad statement on the state of intelligence gathering in the city, said a senior officer at Lalbazar.         
	Officers at police stations admit to the problem.        
	An anti-rowdy officer takes at least an year to develop reliable contacts in his area. Since the reshuffle before elections, anti-rowdy officers across the city have hardly found time to nurture their sources because of the anti-pollution drive and Puja, said an officer at Watgunge police station.

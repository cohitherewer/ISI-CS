The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Schools cut fun budget
                                                                                                               Schools cut fun budget
  - Extra-curricular activities sacrificed to pay teachers          MITA MUKHERJEE                                    
	Private English-medium schools in Calcutta are cutting down on extra-curricular activities to cushion the impact of an impending pay hike for teachers on their budgets.        
	We are not going to organise any big event this year because that would entail spending a huge amount of money, Malini Bhagat, the principal of Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School, told Metro.        
	Some schools have already raised fees to offset the increase in establishment costs but the rest say they would rather curb expenditure than burden parents and guardians with an immediate hike. In any case, we cant depend on a fee hike alone to meet the additional expenses. We need to rationalise expenditure since we cant avoid implementing the Fifth Pay Commissions recommendations, said the principal of a boys school.        
	The budgets for annual cultural events and sports competitions in some schools have already shrunk.        
	Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School, known to spend a couple of lakhs on its annual sports meets and cultural shows, is going easy this year.         
	We had organised our 2008 concert at the Science City auditorium and were supposed to hold a sports meet at Rabindra Sarobar this year. We have now decided to hold the meet on our school premises to curtail expenditure, said Bhagat.         
	A few schools like Don Bosco, St Xaviers, St James, Pratt Memorial, Calcutta Boys and Calcutta Girls have, however, promised not to put extra-curricular activities on the cost-cutting block.        
	Apart from high academic standards, parents who send their children to our schools appreciate our focus on extra-curricular activities. Given the situation, we surely wont increase our expenditure on sports and concerts but there wont be a drastic decline either, said Norton Emanuel, the executive secretary of the Bengal Regional Conference that runs schools under the Methodist Church such as Calcutta Boys and Calcutta Girls.         
	For unaided schools that depend entirely on fees to meet establishment costs, there is no option but to pass on the burden of rising expenditure to parents and guardians.         
	St James School will be implementing its fee hike in phases, said principal Terence Ireland.         
	Richard Gasper of St Augustine Day School said prioritising expenditure was the only way out. We are trying to keep some development and expansion programmes on hold.

                                                                                                               2 killed in Holi violence
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A young criminal was killed in a gang war in the city and a man was beaten to death in the suburbs on Holi.        
	Sheikh Kallu, 22, and his associates were drinking in a shanty on Khagen Chatterjee Road, Cossipore, around 1pm on Wednesday when members of a rival gang attacked them with bombs, said police.        
	One of the bombs blew up Kallus face. His associates managed to escape. They returned with bombs and daggers a while later and fought with members of the other gang for half an hour, triggering panic among residents.        
	Kallu, who belonged to Azizuls gang, died on the spot. We have arrested four members of the rival gang, said an officer of Cossipore police station.        
	According to him, Azizul and his rival Ganesh, both extortionists, have been trying to wrest control of the area for the past few months.         
	In the other incident, 35-year-old Subhankar Chakrabarty was hit with bricks when he tried to prevent a group from drinking in the open at Joynagar in Habra, North 24 Parganas, on Wednesday afternoon.         
	According to police, Chakrabarty, an employee of a hosiery unit in the area, was playing cards with three of his friends near a playground when five drunk youths sat down near them and took out bottles of liquor from a bag.        
	Chakrabarty objected to them drinking in the open, which resulted in an argument that led to fisticuffs. One of the five hit Chakrabarty on the head with a brick.         
	He was rushed to Habra State General Hospital and later shifted to RG Kar hospital. He was declared dead on arrival at the hospital.        
	Two hundred people were arrested in Behala, Thakurpukur, Regent Park, Sonarpur and other parts of South 24-Parganas for forcibly smearing pedestrians with colours.

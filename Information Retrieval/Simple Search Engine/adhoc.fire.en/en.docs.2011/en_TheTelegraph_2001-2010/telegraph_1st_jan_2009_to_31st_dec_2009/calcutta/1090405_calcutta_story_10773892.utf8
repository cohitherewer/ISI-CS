The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Warning: Poila Baisakh ahead
                                                                                                               Warning: Poila Baisakh ahead
										      caleidoscope                                          
	The election drumbeats have begun to roll, parties are switching loyalties and leaders firing verbal fusillades.         
	The downturn is eating into our purses. Salaries  and jobs  are being cut. The EMI is a dreaded word. The Nano went away. IPL is being held in another country. These are trying times. Amid all this, 1416 is creeping up the alley.         
	The Bengali New Year promises to be a quieter affair this year with April 16, the day after, overshadowing Poila Baisakh in public minds, when the polling starts  though not in Bengal.         
	A Nava Varsha card has captured the tensions. Atonkito Bangali: Ki jani Ki hoy/ Ki jani ki hoy is the message. The context is poles apart from Arati Mukherjees romantic hit song Ek Baisakhe Dekha Holo Dujonay, which the lyrics seem to be drawing on.         
	If the words look to the future the figures look back at the past. To a side is a dots-and-crosses table that takes stock of Bengals account ledger in the year gone by.         
	The accounts for the Bengali in 1415, the nano-sized card announces, add up to zero.         
	The unusual missive comes from an even more unusual sender  Shibmandir, best known as the organisers of the south Calcutta Durga puja.         
	A smart card?        
	Prepare to go back in time when you go to recharge your Metro railway smart card, which is valid for a month. A fault in the system is changing the year of validity from 2009 to 2001 at times.         
	Because of this error a young woman in a hurry, who wanted to reach office before her boss did, turned up even later. And not only on that day.         
	One day, when it read wrong, the smart card was taken away and she was given a chit of paper. She was told to return after two weeks at least, when the card would be returned. And in the intervening period, she would have to stand in the long queue at the Tollygunge station every day for the two zones one ride ticket.         
	When the card was finally returned  three, not two, weeks later  it was declared invalid and the security deposit forfeited, allegedly because it had been damaged by the woman when she was using it.         
	But of course the Metro railway authorities didnt see it when she submitted it to them when it did not read right.         
	So it was back to the end of the queue for a fresh card and deposit.         
	Voter woos        
	We have an election mascot in the shape of Anandababu (picture above), who looks like a male version of Buladi and promises to look into the troubles of the multitudes with Voter ID problems.         
	But that doesnt seem to have helped the processes in the real world.         
	A prospective voter, who had lost his ID card and after many trips to the office in Salt Lake could successfully apply for a duplicate in December, was told to come back in January, when it would be ready.         
	He has made three trips already to the office and is preparing for the fourth one. He is determined to be armed with his Voter ID before the elections. Best of luck to him.

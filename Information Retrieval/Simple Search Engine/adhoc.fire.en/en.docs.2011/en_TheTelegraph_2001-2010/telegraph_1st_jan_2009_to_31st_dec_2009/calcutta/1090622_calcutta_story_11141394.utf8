	Pakhi Miyan, the kingpin of the biggest drug cartel in the Northeast, was picked up at Nayeemnagar in Durgapur town in a joint raid by the Calcutta polices Special Task Force (STF) and Assam police on Sunday morning.         
	Mian, who is wanted by Assam police in several criminal cases, had fled police custody from Gauhati Medical College and Hospital in December last year by drugging a constable. He was arrested by Bengal police from a Baguiati flat in April 2008 and handed over to Assam police.        
	According to police, Mian had rented a flat in Durgapur posing as a trader. Rajiv Kumar, the joint commissioner of STF, said officers raided the house at 11am on a tip-off.        
	Mians landlord told us that the gangster used to leave the flat after offering morning prayers and return late at night. He never interacted with people in the locality, said an officer.

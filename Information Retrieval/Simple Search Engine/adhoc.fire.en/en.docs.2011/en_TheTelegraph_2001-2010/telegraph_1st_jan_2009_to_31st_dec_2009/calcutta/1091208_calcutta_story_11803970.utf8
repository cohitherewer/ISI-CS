The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Nod and rider for market revamp
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Nod and rider for market revamp
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                          The blaze at Nandaram Market                                  
	The mayor has allowed the reconstruction of fire-ravaged Nandaram Market up to the 12th floor and its Kashiram block up to the ninth floor, as demanded by traders, if experts deem the project feasible.        
	The reconstruction, Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, has clarified, will have to be preceded by demolition of all storeys above the fifth floor.        
	Demolition of the storeys beyond the fifth floor is a must. Without it no prayer, demand or proposal of the traders will be accepted. They must honour the Supreme Court order that the structure above the fifth floor has to be razed, the mayor said.        
	The reconstruction proposal  Bhattacharya has signed it following its approval by the mayoral council  has to be vetted by experts from Besu or IIT Kharagpur.        
	Samar Chowdhury, the general secretary of the Nandaram Market Disaster Management Welfare Committee, said: We are not opposed to the demolition provided the mayor guarantees reconstruction. The lives of more than 500 traders will be ruined if we are not allowed to reconstruct the structure above the fifth floor.        
	A team from the civil engineering department of Jadavpur University, headed by Somnath Ghosh, had earlier advised demolition above the sixth floor and reconstruction till the ninth floor (up to roof of the eighth floor) using light partition walls.        
	Nandaram Market, the biggest cloth-cum-tailoring material market in the city which was destroyed in a 100-hour blaze in January 2008, was a G+23 structure in 1988. More than 20 years ago, the apex court had held that the storeys above the fifth floor had been built illegally and ordered their demolition.        
	In the 1990s, the structure above the 12th floor was pulled down.        
	Sources in the CMC said the floors between the 5th and 11th floors could not be demolished as they were occupied by traders.        
	Post-fire, the civic authorities and police tried to pull down the damaged and the illegal parts but had to back out following resistance from a section of traders.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Sakir Arif, 23, was arrested on Tuesday for allegedly stealing Rs 1.4 lakh from his fathers office in Burrabazar. His father, Sikandar Arif, 60, tried to withdraw the police complaint after his arrest but cops refused. Sakir was sent to judicial custody.         
	The police said Sikandar, a trader, had lodged a complaint on November 10 about the theft at his office. The main door had not been tampered with and we suspected it to be an inside job, said an officer.         
	A probe revealed Sakir used to visit his fathers office occasionally. We kept an eye on him and questioned him. Sakir broke down and admitted to the theft, said Nanda Dulal Pal, the officer-in-charge of Burrabazar police station.         
	The cops said Sakir had taken the keys from his home, stolen the money and placed the keys where his father had kept them.         
	After Sakirs arrest, Sikander wanted to withdraw his complaint. The case was registered and Sakir had been taken to the court. How could we allow him to withdraw the complaint? We will file the chargesheet in the case soon, said an officer.

	Tried and tested subjects like medicine, engineering and IT, as well as newer professions like aviation, animation, travel and tourism and fashion designing, brought in the crowds at the 18th career fair, organised by Afairs Exhibition and Media, at the Ice Skating Rink on April 18, 19 and 20.         
	Targeted at people from the age of 17 to 24, the fair saw more than 100 institutions from across Indian cities like Mumbai, New Delhi, Pune and Bangalore.         
	This year also saw five Singapore universities, including James Cook University and Stansfield College, offering courses in management and IT, in association with the Singapore Tourism Board. Two Russian institutions, including Ryazan State I.P Pavlov Medical University and Saratov State Medical University, were also present.         
	Group discussions and seminars were held on all three days at Birla Industrial and Technological Museum. While foreign education consultants Global Reach dealt with opportunities of studying in the UK, law and engineering as career options were some of the other subjects addressed in the course of the fair.         
	We are targeting students who have just passed their X and XII board exams and are looking to make career choices. Our focus is the changing needs of students who are more open to new-age careers now, said Sanjeev Bolia, director, Afairs.         
	Said Nikita Mahipal, who has just appeared for her Class XII board exams from National Gems Higher Secondary School: I was impressed by the courses on offer here. I also picked up brochures from Tasmac Management Training Resources, Pune.         
	The participating colleges will return for an admissions fair from June 6 to 8, where students will be able to register on the spot after interviews and entrance exams.

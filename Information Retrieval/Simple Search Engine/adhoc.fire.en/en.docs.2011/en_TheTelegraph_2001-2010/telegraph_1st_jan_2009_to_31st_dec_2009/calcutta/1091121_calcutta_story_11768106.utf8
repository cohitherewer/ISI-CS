                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Plot poser to govt, Sourav
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The state government will have to tell the court within two weeks under what law it had handed over a 62-cottah plot in Salt Lake CA block to Sourav Ganguly to set up an educational institute.        
	The former Team India skipper, too, will have to file an affidavit stating his stand on the allegation that the plot had been handed over to him violating norms.        
	The bench of Acting Chief Justice B. Bhattacharya and Justice P. Mondal passed the order on a petition by residents of CA block who had alleged that the urban development department had violated norms while handing over the plot to Ganguly.        
	S.K. Mukhopadhyay, the president of the association, had pleaded for an injunction against construction till all aspects of the plot handover were probed. But the bench refused to pass an injunction.        
	Ganguly has been made a respondent to the case.        
	The residents association submitted that the urban development department had violated its own policy decision (memo number 5607-UD/Y-7/99) by allotting the 62-cottah plot without publishing any advertisement.        
	The decision also went against a high court order asking the state to seek its permission before handing over any plot in Salt Lake to an individual or organisation, Arunava Ghosh, the petitioners lawyer, told the court.        
	According to the petition, Sourav had first been allotted a 50-cottah plot in BF Block which he did not like and asked the government for the CA block plot.        
	The residents said they had stumbled upon the irregularities while going through details of the handover, obtained under the Right to Information Act.

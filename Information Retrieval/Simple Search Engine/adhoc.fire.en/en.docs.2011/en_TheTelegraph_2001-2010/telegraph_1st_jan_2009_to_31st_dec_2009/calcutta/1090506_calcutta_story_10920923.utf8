The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Waugh to wade into clean-up cause
                                                                                                               Waugh to wade into clean-up cause
          KARO CHRISTINE KUMAR                          Steve Waugh at Udayan, in Barrackpore, in the summer of 2008                                  
	Steve Waugh is ready to get his hands and feet dirty  for the sake of a water body in the city he loves.        
	The Australian cricket legend will wade into the murky waters of a canal in the Kabardanga area near Thakurpukur  not far from former arch-rival Sourav Gangulys home ground in Behala  to lead a clean-up drive on Thursday and champion a cause that was kicked off at the Dhakuria Lakes on Sunday morning.        
	This particular canal is in a terrible state, and a part of it runs through the Missionaries of the Word (a home for children whose mothers are from red-light areas), said Shamlu Dudeja of Calcutta Foundation, which is leading the clean-up programme in collaboration with a voluntary group called Calcutta Sparkling. Steve has been a pillar of support in the past. He is one of those caring human beings who embrace people who others shun.        
	The bed of the canal is full of plastic debris and as its level has risen over the years, the amount of water in the canal has declined. Waugh will take the watery pitch to clean up the mess in a pond-like plot leading to the canal.        
	Waugh, of course, has walked the community service talk in Calcutta from March 1998, when he became closely associated with Udayan, a rehabilitation home for children from leprosy colonies. In February 2005, he helped some tsunami-sufferers in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands by auctioning his bats at a fund-raiser in Calcutta. He was last in Calcutta for a cause in April 2008 when he spent a day with the Udayan kids. I love going back to Udayan. The kids there are fantastic and, then, its so peaceful and tranquil. I like seeing the smiling faces of the kids. Udayan, I think, is great for the human spirit, he had said then.        
	That human spirit will shine through on Thursday in a city where celebrities rarely get down and dirty for a cause. Steve Waugh is just the right man to undertake such a task. His involvement will take the awareness about the polluted water bodies in Calcutta to a different level, said green activist Mudar Patherya. After batting for Mission Clean-up, Waugh will also inaugurate the computer room at the Missionaries of the Word.

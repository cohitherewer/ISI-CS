The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Vat and vehicles choke vital road
                                                                                                               Vat and vehicles choke vital road
          ONTHESPOT - NEW CIT ROAD                            Garbage and parked trucks occupy a major portion of New CIT Road and (right) an open vat. Pictures by Bishwarup Dutta                                
	Few roads in Calcutta can match the ugliness and lawlessness of New CIT Road, home to several landmark buildings, including the headquarters of Calcutta Improvement Trust, the body responsible for making the city a better place to live in.         
	New CIT Road also houses Poddar Court and the countrys highest selling Raymond outlet. But hawker encroachment, illegal parking, a huge open vat and a public toilet have turned this stretch into a horror zone.         
	The hawkers have been here for the past 20 years, ever since we opened shop. The situation hasnt changed. Parking is a problem here, but the vat is an even bigger problem, said Siddharth Pansari, who owns the Raymond outlet.         
	Encroachment: Food vendors, hawkers and small traders have usurped the pavements on either side, while four-wheelers claim almost half the road for parking. A few car repair shops stack tyres on the pavements. Some of them have even extended their business on to the road.         
	The problem is compounded by large trucks that remain parked on both sides of the road to load and unload goods.         
	Parking is allowed only on the southern side of New CIT Road but sometimes cars are parked on both flanks. Traffic cops patrol the road to keep it free but once the sergeants are gone, the cars come back to park, said Dominic Lee, who owns a Chinese food ingredients shop on New CIT Road.         
	Raising a stink: The pay-and-use toilet was built two decades ago, blocking a huge portion of the pavement. Close to the toilet is the sprawling open vat that spills over to the road. There are days when no one turns up to clean the garbage. It stinks and we have a terrible time sitting in our shops, said a trader.        
	The vat poses a huge problem as its right on the main road. Things will get better if it is shifted elsewhere and the spot is used to rehabilitate the hawkers. The food vendors can set up shop here, which will keep the pavements free, said Pansari.         
	Pedestrian plight: Nothing moves during the evening rush hours, when the offices shut down for the day. A large number of office-goers hit the road to walk up to Central Metro station.         
	People coming to Dalhousie from south and north Calcutta use this stretch to reach Central Metro station. As the footpaths are blocked by hawkers, they are forced to walk on the road, said Sumit Majumdar, who works in the area.         
	Policespeak: We are unable to take action against the businessmen as most of them are connected to the authorities. The hawkers and small traders enjoy the patronage of local politicians. The police are helpless, said a traffic police officer.         
	A section of the traders allege that lodging police complaints doesnt yield any result as the encroachers are thriving under political backing. But Burrabazar MLA Mohammad Sohrab brushed off the charge. We dont back anyone. The hawkers are supposed to occupy only 25 per cent of the pavement but they dont go by any rules, he said.        
	Councillorspeak: Rehana Khatoon, the councillor of ward 44, admitted all the problems plaguing the road but pleaded helplessness. It is true that garbage piles up and makes the area messy. But I dont know why the toilet was built on the pavement. Unauthorised parking is a problem too, she said.                          SUBHAJOY ROY

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Salt Lake ban on poll clutter

	Salt Lake, the one oasis in a graffiti-scarred city this election, has now banned the remaining weapons of poll-related visual pollution.        
	The Bidhannagar administration has set Thursday evening as the deadline for parties to clean the clutter or face Operation Clean-up from the next day.        
	We have decided to depute officials, accompanied by police personnel, to remove all campaign materials from the vicinity of public and private properties. Our intention is to keep Salt Lake clean, election or no election, said Asoke Das, the sub-divisional officer of Bidhannagar and assistant returning officer for Barasat constituency.        
	The cost of removing the poll materials will be added to the expenditure statements of the candidates, Das added.         
	The decision, taken in consultation with the Election Commission, was communicated to all political parties during a meeting that continued till late on Tuesday evening.        
	The dont-dare-deface-our-walls stand taken by residents has kept Salt Lake free of graffiti so far, forcing parties to rely on flex hoardings, cut-outs and flags to remain visible in the run-up to polling day. If the authorities can now successfully remove the rest of the clutter, it will set a precedent, said Nibedita Goswami, a resident of FD block.        
	It is an exemplary effort by the residents and authorities of Salt Lake. I have said this time and again  Salt Lake is an oasis in terms of visual cleanliness in Calcutta, said chief electoral officer Debashis Sen.        
	Metro ran a check on the township on Wednesday and spotted violations at several places, including Karunamoyee bus stand, Salt Lake gate number 1, Bidyut Bhavan, Karunamoyee Abasan, Baisakhi Abasan, Salt Lake swimming pool, CK Market and the traffic islands.        
	Around 170 FIRs have been filed  mostly suo motu  and more than 200 show-cause notices issued to various parties.

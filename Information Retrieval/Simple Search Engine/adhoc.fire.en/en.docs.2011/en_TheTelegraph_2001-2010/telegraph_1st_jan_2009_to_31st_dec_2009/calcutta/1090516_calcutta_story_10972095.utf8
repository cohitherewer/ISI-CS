                      Realism and escapism                    An adaptation of Tennessee Williams celebrated play The Glass Menagerie, this evenings production by Little Thespian attempts to universalise the lot of common people, cutting across the boundaries of space and time. Patjhad introduces us to a family that strikes us as only too familiar; Gayatri, a middle-aged mother, who lives in Darjeeling with her grown-up children, son Indivar and daughter Yamini. The family members have their individual quirks and idiosyncrasies. Gayatri lives in a world that oscillates between illusion and reality. The changeover between these two worlds is her only defence against the boredom and hopelessness of living. Caught up in a materialistic world, her son Indivar tries to escape to a world of dreams, imagination and excitement. His sister Yamini has imprisoned herself in her own falsely-secure world, which she should have escaped from for her own good. The play deals with multiple themes related to hope, expectation and disappointment, of imagination versus realism and of escapism from lifes duties and responsibilities. At the end of the play, Gayatri and Yamini are seen to recede and regress further into their unreal world while Indivar finally manages to break free from the shackles of his life within the family. Design and direction: S.M. Azhar Alam.                    Event: Play in Hindi, Patjhad, produced by Little Thespian When: Today at 7 pm Where: Padatik, 6/7 AJC Bose Road

                      Life is beautiful                    Portraying the many forms and hues of life in their different aspects, the ongoing exhibition of photographs presents a delightful rediscovery of the truth that beauty exists in all familiar and unfamiliar objects of life. Mala Mukerjee relies on her senses while choosing subjects to capture with her camera. Rather than explore a particular theme, she images anything that catches her fancy. This show, which features her recent works, has pictures that are products of chance encounters. They represent her search for beauty in the most trivial things that clutter our everyday lives. Smita Barooah Sanyals work focuses on the interplay of form, colour and texture. Compiled from her travels around India and Singapore, her images depict mundane architectural structures whose beauty is lost to our heedless eyes. The photographs of Suparno Banerjee are part of a series that continues his exploration of forms in nature. They examine the threshold of human perception in an attempt to detect the point at which a familiar object loses its familiarity and appears strange, exotic and obscure.                  Event: An exhibition of photographs by Mala Mukerjee, Smita Barooah Sanyal and Suparno Banerjee When: Till April 19; 4 pm - 8 pm Where: Birla Academy of Art and Culture, 108 Southern Avenue, 4th floor gallery

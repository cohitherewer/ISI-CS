The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Order in parking chaos day after
                                                                                                               Order in parking chaos day after
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Method returned to the parking madness around the Headquarters Traffic Guard on Friday after Metro published a report on illegal parking on the stretch.        
	The men in uniform allowed only 40-odd vehicles to be parked in a single file parallel to the pavement outside their Brabourne Road office.        
	On Thursday, more than 70 vehicles, including van rickshaws and goods carriers, were parked perpendicular to the pavement on both sides of the road, between the Canning Street-Brabourne Road crossing and Tea Board.         
	The stretch, where cops were conspicuous by their absence on Thursday, were being manned by a sergeant, three constables and three civic police volunteers on Friday.        
	There are orders to enforce parking rules, said the sergeant while booking a driver for parking in double lane.         
	A civic police volunteer was more forthcoming. Some cops and representatives of the co-operative that collects parking fee were allowing vehicles to park illegally and taking money. The cops were summoned by the officer-in-charge today. Everything changed after that, he said.        
	Some motorcycles were still parked on the pavement and in double lanes but the van-rickshaws had disappeared on Friday.        
	Regulars on the stretch doubted whether the drive would last. I hardly had to brake on the stretch today. This shows the cops can enforce the rules if they want to. But will they continue to do so? asked a motorist.

                                                                                                               Have an idea? Wake up amp; smell the coffee

	Business brainstorming over coffee is set to become a familiar sight at city cafes as the Open Coffee Club (OCC) movement takes root here.        
	The movement, to encourage entrepreneurs, developers and investors to interact and network informally, started in London and has become popular in the West. Calcutta is the eighth Indian city to host Open Coffee Club meets.        
	Some of us were looking for like-minded people to discuss start-ups and the concept of Open Coffee Club seemed ideal, said Mitesh Arya, an interface design consultant who used to attend OCC meets in Mumbai and was instrumental in bringing the concept to Calcutta.        
	The first OCC meet in the city was held at the RDB Boulevard Caf Coffee Day on August 26. A dozen people, including businessmen, entrepreneurs and would-be entrepreneurs turned up.        
	If you are not interested in starting a business, you can find employment at a start-up being planned, launched or already in place, said freelance web architect Sumit Datta.        
	One of the participants at the first meeting bagged a creative writing assignment, while two others teamed up for a project.        
	OCC meets are held on Wednesdays at the RDB Boulevard Caf Coffee Day and on Saturdays at the Upper Wood Street Caf Coffee Day. Start- up Saturday, a community-driven forum with a structured agenda, is scheduled for the second Saturday of the month. The stress is on brainstorming and networking.        
	In a business plan competition, only one plan stands to gain or at the most two. But OCC provides equal opportunity to everyone and aims to offer sustainable support, said Datta, who is trying to re-launch Pixlie, a web architecture venture.        
	We have arranged for an hours networking opportunity after every Startup Saturday, wannabe entrepreneurs can meet and discuss problems, network and communicate, and find mentors and funds, said Datta.        
	Participants at the first Startup Saturday were addressed by state power secretary G.D. Gautama and Globsyn director Romit Dasgupta. The event saw the launch of an angel fund (finance for start-up) called Seeders, the name and tagline for which was decided at an OCC meet.        
	A venture by Pallav Nadhani, co-founder of InfoSoft Global, and Abhishek Rungta, the CEO of Indusnet Technologies, Seeders will provide angel funding and an incubation centre to start-ups.        
	We did not have anything like OCC or Startup Saturday when we started out. Being part of these I can see that they are extremely helpful for young people looking to do their own thing, said Rungta.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | I thought it was like the 9/11 attack
                                                                                                               I thought it was like the 9/11 attack
                            
	Pankaj Gupta, a wedding planner based in Delhi, was at Vedic Village on Sunday. This is the 42-year-olds account:        
	I had organised a high-profile engagement at Taj Bengal and the after-party get-together was fixed at Vedic Village. We had booked several villas.        
	We spent Saturday night there and planned to check out late on Sunday. I had a flight to catch to Delhi at 8pm and the others had flights to Mumbai, Bangalore, Delhi and Nagpur.        
	Around 3.30pm, we received a call from the reception telling us that villagers had entered the premises and were setting things on fire!        
	We quickly packed our stuff and rushed out. Two women and I got into a golf cart and we drove towards the reception to hand over the villa keys. The women were dropped off and the golf cart made its way to the main gate.        
	As I approached the main gate, I saw hordes of people breaking in. They spotted me and rushed towards me.        
	I jumped off the golf cart and ran for my life. I heard the sound of revolver shots; what raced through my head was the 9/11 attack in Mumbai.        
	I ran towards the safety of the villa. Six of us hid in one of the rooms for what seemed like eternity. We could see fire in the distance and smoke billowing out into the open skies. Some of the attackers were 50m away from our window.        
	It was pitch dark when suddenly, around 7pm, some people banged on our door. We thought the mob had hunted us down but it was some staff members of the resort who had come to our rescue.        
	We were evacuated through the back gate. As I turned back one last time, I saw the thatched roofs of several farmhouses on fire.        
	I took the morning flight to Delhi on Monday.        
	(As told to Karo Christine Kumar)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | He serves tea when not swimming
                                                                                                               He serves tea when not swimming
  - Teen champ who helps father run Bagbazar stall sets sights on Olympics           JHINUK MAZUMDAR                          WATER WONDER: Sourav Saha. Picture by Amit Datta                                        
	A tea vendors son has swum against the tide of deprivation to make a splash as a junior national aquatics champion.        
	When he is not doing laps in the pool, Sourav Saha, 14, serves tea to customers at his fathers stall near the Bagbazar Bata stop. The Class IX student of Shyambazar AV School, who cant attend classes for more than two days a week because of his hectic schedule, utilises his leisure hours to catch up on studies.        
	My goal is to represent the country in the Olympics, and my priority at the moment is to train hard. I also need to help my father keep the home fires burning, says the teenager, who struck gold in 200m butterfly stroke at the 36th Junior National Aquatics Championship in Jaipur last June.        
	Sourav, who had earlier won gold in the state junior championships, was on Saturday awarded the Unveiling Stars Scholarship instituted by the Interact Club of La Martiniere at The Telegraph School Awards for Excellence.        
	Father Pinaki Saha is his biggest motivator. We had enrolled him for swimming classes at Hatkhola Club (in Deshbandhu Park) after hearing about children drowning in the lakes while playing. We couldnt have imagined he would become so good at it, recalls the tea vendor.        
	But Pinaki rues being financially incapable of fulfilling his talented sons requirements, including swimming gear and nutrition. The Sahas subsist on the Rs 2,500-3,000 that comes from Pinakis tea stall every month.        
	We spend Rs 1,000 on house rent and the electricity bill. We dont have anything left at the end of the month to spend on Sourav, says Pinaki, sitting in his tin-roofed 9x9ft room at Uma Kanta Sen Lane in Paikpara.         
	But ask Sourav and he says that adversity has actually made him more determined. My father does so much for me. I would now like to ease his burden, he smiles.        
	Sourav, who started swimming when he was around five years old, enrolled with the Self Culture Institute at College Square after learning the ropes and has been with the club since. He has been training under the aegis of the Sports Authority of India since May 2008.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Flier crush in festive rush
                                                                                                               Flier crush in festive rush
  - LONG QUEUES, DELAYED TAKE-OFF MARK INCREASE IN TRAFFIC          SANJAY MANDAL                          A passenger tells her relatives through a hole in the glass faade of the lounge that she and her family have finally managed to check in after queuing up for nearly an hour on Sunday afternoon.

	Calcutta airport is creaking under the weight of increased passenger traffic this festive season, triggering chaos during check-in and delays in take-off.        
	The poor state of infrastructure at the airport, still a work in progress, has been exposed these past few days with most flights going full and passenger queues starting from the entrance during peak hours.        
	Fliers are arriving on time but the airports passenger-handling capacity is proving to be inadequate. The time taken to clear a passenger for boarding from the time he or she enters the terminal is delaying flights by 20 to 30 minutes on an average during rush hours, said a senior official of the Airlines Operators Committee.        
	On Sunday, most flights taking off from Calcutta were full. Not a single seat was available on our flights, said a spokesperson for Air India.         
	Anita Mankani, booked on a Kingfisher flight to Goa, said she feared missing her flight until she got her boarding pass. It took me an hour to reach the security hold from the entrance. I didnt know that the infrastructure here is so inadequate, she complained.        
	The newly created direct entrance and a larger lounge didnt seem to help.        
	The original entrance is now hardly used by passengers because they have to go through a second security check at the point where visitors and fliers are segregated. Most passengers prefer the new gate through which one can reach the check-in area directly, said a senior airport official.        
	At least 150 people were in the queue to enter the terminal throughout the morning and evening rush hours on Sunday.        
	A shortage of X-ray machines and manpower to scan luggage compounded the congestion. We have three machines but one of them cant be used except during an emergency because there are not enough CISF (Central Industrial Security Force) personnel, the official said.         
	Sources said the new security-check counters on the second floor of the terminal could have eased the congestion but were under-utilised.        
	Most airlines prefer to take passengers for boarding through the ground floor gates, which is one of the reasons for the long queues at the sole security hold there, said an official of the Airports Authority of India.        
	For passengers, the lack of even basic airport amenities like trolleys at the entrance was a major peeve.        
	A flier alighting from a car with an infant in her arms was seen desperately looking for a trolley and glancing at her watch. Is this a railway station or an airport? she wondered aloud.        
	Airport officials contested the allegation that trolleys were not being collected from the check-in arena and brought back to the entrance at regular intervals. We are handling more passengers than the terminals capacity. Extra facilities are being arranged for to ease the congestion, said airport director R. Srinivasan.        
	But Rana Basu Thakur, a Mumbai-based senior company executive returning after spending the Puja vacations in Calcutta, said the airport authorities could have handled the rush better.        
	My flight was at 11.20am and I reached the airport before 10am. The queue at the check-in arena extended beyond the entrance, and it was only after many of us protested that the authorities split the line into two. After checking in, I was in the queue for another half-an-hour at the security hold, he said.        
	As Basu Thakur waited for the boarding announcement, he noticed an elderly woman scanning the lounge for a seat. She looked unwell. So I offered my strolley to her to sit for a while, he said.        
	Passengers returning home also did not escape the chaos. The pre-paid taxi counter had a difficult time handling the rush of arrivals.        
	According to Srinivasan, the average daily footfall since Puja was 11,000-12,000, against 8,000-9,000 at other times. There has been a 35 to 40 per cent increase in domestic passenger traffic from Calcutta over the past few days, the airport director said.

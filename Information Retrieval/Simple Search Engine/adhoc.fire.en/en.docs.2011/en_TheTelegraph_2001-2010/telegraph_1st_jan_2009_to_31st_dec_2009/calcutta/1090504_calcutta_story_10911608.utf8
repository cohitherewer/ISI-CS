                                                                                                               Five killed in storm
          OUR BUREAU                          The pandal that was blown off the terrace in Liluah. (Gopal Senapati)                                  
	The storm on Sunday afternoon claimed five lives in separate mishaps on the fringes and left a trail of uprooted trees that disrupted city traffic for hours.         
	Brijratan Kothari was killed when a pandal erected for a housewarming ceremony was blown off the fourth-floor terrace of a Liluah house. The 50-year-old trader was clinging to a bamboo pole of the pandal as the wind flung it up in the air. Kothari could not hold on to the pole and fell to death, 30 feet from the house.        
	The trader had gone to the terrace after lunch to enjoy the breeze. Suddenly, the wind picked up. A couple of us standing beside him fell to the floor. The others managed to scamper inside the house except Kothari who held on to a bamboo pole. The wind ripped out the water pipes to which the poles were tied and blew the pandal off the roof, said Saraj Das, one of the other invitees.        
	The trader was taken to TL Jaiswal Hospital, where he was declared dead.        
	Mani Rudra, a 51-year-old paan shop owner, was drinking tea in a stall at Agarpara when a wall of the adjoining house fell on him. He was declared dead at Panihati State General Hospital.        
	The other deaths were in North 24-Parganas. The roof of 32-year-old Jyotsna Mahatos thatched house caved in at Sandeshkhali, killing her and injuring three members of her family. Golejan Bibi, a 36-year-old resident of Kadambagachhi in Barasat, also died in a wall collapse. An uprooted coconut tree crushed Lalbanu Bewa, 40, at Minakhan.        
	In the city, at least 32 trees were uprooted, cutting off traffic on important roads.        
	Traffic on Raja Dinendra Street and RG Kar Road was disrupted for about two hours from 3.15pm after a tree fell near the crossing. Dum Dum Road was blocked for four hours for the same reason, said a senior traffic officer.         
	Trees were also uprooted in Tollygunge, New Alipore, Rabindra Sarobar and Bagmari Road. The uprooted trees had not been cleared from several roads till late on Sunday.        
	Suburban trains were disrupted for two hours after power was cut off to stations on the Sealdah division.

                                                                                                               AIDS plan for techies
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The Indian Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday announced a counselling programme to help young BPO employees avoid AIDS.        
	A string of surveys, including one by the West Bengal State AIDS Prevention and Control Society, have identified the BPO sector as highly vulnerable to AIDS.        
	A team of experts constituted by the chamber will visit 15 leading BPOs in the city within the next 30 days and select some employees for counselling. These employees will then carry forward the programme in-house.        
	Rajeev Singh, the director-general of the chamber, also announced a half-yearly award for the company which will provide exemplary leadership and implement result-oriented HIV/AIDS programmes.        
	The national project co-ordinator of the International Labour Organisation, Syed Mohammad Afsar, who attended the programme, said it was profitable for business houses to launch such awareness programmes because they would reduce absenteeism and the cost of training new personnel.

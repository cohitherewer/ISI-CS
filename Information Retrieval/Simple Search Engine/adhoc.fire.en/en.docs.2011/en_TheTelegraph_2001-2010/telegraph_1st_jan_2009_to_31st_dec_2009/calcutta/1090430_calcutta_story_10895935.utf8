The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tolly drives a plex bargain
                                                                                                               Tolly drives a plex bargain
          KUSHALI NAG                          Abir and Rimjhim in Cross Connection, which releases in multiplexes on Friday                                  
	Tollywood has lifted the embargo on multiplex releases though the revenue-sharing dispute is yet to be resolved.         
	May 1, when the ban was to come into effect, will see eight shows of Sudeshna Roy and Abhijit Guhas Cross Connection in city multiplexes. Last week, Rangeen Godhuli released at the multiplexes after Tollywood pushed back the date the embargo was to come into effect.        
	The meeting between producers and distributors of Tollywood, a member of the Eastern India Motion Pictures Association and multiplex representatives on Tuesday paved the way for the Friday release.        
	The multiplexes agreed to seven out of the 10 demands we had placed before them at the meeting. We wanted the multiplexes to be less rigid on show timings for Bengali films. Advance booking for Bengali films would open only on Thursday evening or Friday. Now, the multiplex authorities have agreed to start advance bookings from Wednesday, said Pulak Mukherjee, the vice-president of the association.        
	The dispute over 50-50 revenue sharing between producers-distributors and multiplexes will, however, have to be worked out at the national level.         
	The association has also formed a committee to discuss smaller issues with the multiplex authorities at the regional level. The panel comprises seven producers and distributors, three multiplex representatives and one member of the association.        
	Its not possible to wait for Mumbai to take all the decisions. Thats why weve decided to form a committee locally to discuss minor problems, added Mukherjee.         
	The multiplexes have also agreed to slot Bengali films in the evening and not just in the morning and afternoon. So long, the multiplexes failed to understand the business prospects of Bengali films are different from that of Bollywood releases. Bengali films do good business on the second and third week but most multiplexes do not run Bengali films for three weeks. These issues have been sorted out in the meeting, said distributor Arijit Dutta.         
	The national-level issues will be discussed nationally. Tuesdays meeting was regarding administrative issues and they have been sorted out amicably. We will continue to screen Bengali films, said Captain Virendra Marya, the regional director (east) of INOX leisure Ltd.        
	The lifting of the embargo has come at the right time for the Cross Connection team. The film is very urban and we were looking forward to a multiplex release, said Roy.        
	Her producer, Snigdha Basu of Acropolis Entertainment, was elated. We are a Mumbai-based production house and always wanted our first venture to release at the multiplexes. Besides the Mumbai producer-distributor guild has kept regional films out of the tussle.

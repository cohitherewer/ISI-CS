The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Where whitewash is eyewash
                                                                                                               Where whitewash is eyewash
                                          
	The Election Commission (EC) has failed to do what some protesting residents of 21/1B Pratapaditya Road have managed  get the very hands that defaced the walls to clean them.        
	In a showcause notice to the CPMs poll war room in Calcutta South on March 24, the Election Commission ordered that the walls of three premises where the graffiti code of conduct was violated be whitewashed within three days. After all, no permission had been taken from the owners before the paintbrush brigade sullied their walls with graffiti.        
	But the showcause notice also had an escape clause, allowing the violators three days to furnish a consent note and let the graffiti be. That is precisely what the partys paintbrush machinery has exploited, reducing the whitewash notice to an eyewash.        
	Metro visited the three premises over the weekend to see how the graffiti rule was first flouted and then a mockery made of the Election Commissions showcause notice.        
	8C Nepal Bhattacharjee Street (off Kalighat)        
	The 15x10 feet wall was painted red on the night of March 7 by CPM cadres without the permission of owner Sikha Dutta. On March 12, officers of Kalighat police station came calling and she complained that her wall had been defaced without her consent.        
	Soon after the cops left, four party cadres came to my house and asked me to sign on a form. It was ridiculous  they had already put down my name on a consent letter! protested the 60-year-old widow, who lives with her married daughter.        
	That form  with Duttas name on it  then made its way to the returning officer within three days of the showcause notice being served, allowing the wall to remain whitewash-proof.        
	Dutta was initially hopeful that the Election Commissions tough stand on wall graffiti would deter political parties. But now, three weeks after her wall was painted, she has all but given up. I am still awaiting action against the violators. The EC should ensure my wall is whitewashed.                 
	6A Nepal Bhattacharjee Street (off Kalighat)        
	The wall is wider, the fate similar. The Rabin Deb army struck on March 8. When the cops came to check, the owner told them no permission had been taken. Then, CPM cadres arrived armed with a completed consent form. That form was rushed to the returning officer and the whitewash writ thwarted.        
	What should we do? We cannot protest as we have to live with our families in the locality, said the owner, requesting anonymity while speaking to Metro.                
	21A Tollygunge Road (off Keoratala)        
	Here, the wall was defaced on March 10. The owner was forced to sign the consent form on March 14. That signature coerced out of the owner has allowed the CPMs graffiti gang to get away with the writing on the wall.        
	We dont want to get into trouble by speaking out against any party. The ECs model code of conduct regarding graffiti is turning out to be just a gimmick. They should either impose a complete ban or allow graffiti to go on, said the owner, also requesting anonymity.              
	CPMs version        
	Prasad Guha, who is part of the CPMs publicity team in Rashbehari, denies that his graffiti gang has done anything wrong. We are taking permission from owners of the houses. There may be one or two exceptions but we are adhering to the ECs norms, he said.        
	Rabin Debs cellphone was answered by one of his aides. Hes busy campaigning right now. He will be busy all evening. If theres something I can answer, I will be glad to, he told Metro.        
	On being told that the issue was wall graffiti, he said: I think its best if Dada (Deb) speaks to you about this.        
	Deb didnt come on line till late on Sunday.                
	What the wall graffiti victims can do now        
	Send an SMS to or call 9830079999 to lodge a complaint about the consent being fudged or coerced. If no action is taken within a week, send an email to santanujanyahoo.com (Santanu Basu, the officer on special duty, CEOs office), mentioning Defacement in the subject line.        
	 Our Bureau

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Youth held for woman murder
                                                                                                               Youth held for woman murder
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 21-year-old mechanic was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly murdering the woman whose partially decomposed body was found outside a house in a narrow lane at Taltala on April 1.         
	Anis Mallik, the accused, claimed the woman was a sex worker whose name he did not know and admitted to killing her, said police. He allegedly hit her on the head with a hammer when she demanded more money than he had agreed to pay.        
	Mallik, who repairs air-conditioners, told investigators during interrogation that he picked up the woman from Entally on March 29 and took her to his one-room home in Komedan Bagan Lane. He was to pay the woman Rs 300 but next morning she demanded Rs 1,000. When he refused to fork out the extra cash, she tried to take away his cellphone and threatened to raise a hue and cry.         
	Anis hit her on the head with a hammer. Her skull was fractured and she died instantly, said an officer.        
	The youth locked the room and left for work in his two-wheeler.        
	He returned, washed the blood-stained body and kept it under his bed. Next morning, he went to his ancestral village in Amta, South 24-Parganas. On returning, he found that the body had started to stink. He washed it again. Around 3.30am on April 1, he carried the body out of his room. When a group of dogs started barking, he dumped the body about 20ft from his home and fled, added the officer.        
	The body was discovered by other residents a few hours later. Detective chief Jawed Shamim said since the lane was too narrow for a car to enter, the investigators concluded that the woman was alive when she came to the locality and that she was later killed and her body dumped by one of the residents.        
	While questioning residents, the policemen found one of the flats locked and learnt that it had been rented by Mallik.         
	The cops suspect that the youth was helped by another person.

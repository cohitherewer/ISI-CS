          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The North 24-Parganas district court has issued an interim injunction against 14 restaurants and amusement parks playing music at year-end parties.         
	Phonographic Performance Ltd (PPL), which grants public performance licences on behalf of music labels, had slapped legal notices on restaurants and amusement parks that did not pay licence fees.        
	We moved the court against those who did not respond to the notices. The district judge on Saturday issued an ex-parte interim injunction against these places playing music at events hosted between December 25 and 31 till they take our permission, said Sowmya B. Chowdhury, the country head (events) of PPL.        
	On the list are Souravs The Food Pavilion, Swabhumi, Aquatica, Tangerine Banquet and Shimmers Lounge n Bar.

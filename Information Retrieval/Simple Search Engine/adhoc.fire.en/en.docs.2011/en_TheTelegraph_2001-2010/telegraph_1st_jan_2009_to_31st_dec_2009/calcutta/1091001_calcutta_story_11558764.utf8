The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pilot strike ends but turbulence continues
                                                                                                               Pilot strike ends but turbulence continues
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The strike by Air India pilots ended on Wednesday morning but the struggle continued for stranded passengers.        
	Anxious and exhausted faces lined the domestic terminal throughout the day with many of them venting their anger on Air India officials who failed to come up with accurate information about the status of various flights.        
	Three flights  to New Delhi, Dibrugarh and Agartala  were cancelled despite the pilots strike being called off.         
	Around 1.10pm, a Jet Airways flight chartered by Air India landed in Calcutta with 144 passengers who were stranded at Port Blair since Sunday. An Air India official blamed bad weather for the delay in bringing the stranded passengers home.        
	Raj Kumar Sur, one of those on the chartered flight, refused to buy the argument. How could JetLite and Kingfisher planes land there if the weather was bad? Air India officials in Port Blair told us that striking pilots were responsible for the chaos, he said.        
	Moumita Sur, a Class XII student who was part of an eight-member group visiting the Andamans, said the strike had spoiled her Puja vacation.        
	It was a nightmare for us the past few days, she said.        
	Passengers complained about being misled by Air India officials about the timings of chartered flights both on Monday and Tuesday.         
	We were to board a flight on Tuesday morning. Air India officials called around midnight to inform us that the flight had been cancelled. When we reached the airport to enquire about the reason, they refused to speak to us, said Seema Bag, a resident of Moulali.         
	A spokesperson for the airline said normality was restored by evening with all flights on time. We will bring back another 80 passengers stranded in Port Blair by Thursday morning, he promised.        
	On complaints about Air India not refunding the promised Rs 500 per passenger for each days delay, the spokesperson said: We will definitely keep our word. If a passenger didnt receive the amount in Port Blair, he will receive it in Calcutta if the refund was endorsed there.        
	Passengers stranded in Calcutta had paid up to three times the average airfare to book seats on other flights on Tuesday.

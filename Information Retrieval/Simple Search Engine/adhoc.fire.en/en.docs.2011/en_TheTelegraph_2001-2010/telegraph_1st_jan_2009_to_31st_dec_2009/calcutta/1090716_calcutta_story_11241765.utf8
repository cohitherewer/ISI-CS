The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Nodal body scoffs at switch
                                                                                                               Nodal body scoffs at switch
          JAYANTA BASU                                          
	The bid by Modern High School for Girls to convert five of its 15-year-old buses to LPG and escape the high court ban has hit a green hurdle.        
	We cannot give approval to conversion of diesel-driven buses to LPG because such a conversion is not permitted in the Central Motor Vehicles Act, M.K. Chaudhuri, the senior deputy director of Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI), told Metro on Wednesday evening.        
	Contacted in Pune, the official of the central body approving transport vehicles heard out the case of Modern High School seeking ARAI approval for conversion of its old fleet and dismissed it outright.        
	Technically also such conversion is discouraged as it involves change of compressor ignition engine and involves lots of complications. The performance and safety of such converted buses are always under the scanner, even more so with older buses, said Chaudhuri.        
	Metro had reported on July 14 how the move by Modern High School to save its old buses from the firing line had no sanction from ARAI. There is no precedent of diesel buses being converted to LPG and so there is no defined safety or emission standard.        
	Days after granting the school the right to convert and keep its old buses on the road, Calcutta High Court on Monday had rejected a plea by it to direct the ARAI to expedite the granting of permission to convert its old diesel buses to LPG.        
	Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar had said: We are not going to pass another order in the matter. Now, it is your duty to obtain the necessary approval.        
	Appearing for the school, advocate Siddhartha Mitra had placed the request. A spokesperson for Modern High School, however, said on Wednesday that they had not heard of any such development.        
	Calcutta High Court last Friday had given Modern High School for Girls the green signal to run five buses more than 15 years old, provided they met the emission standards. The old buses had been slapped with a government notification to go off the road from July 31.        
	In court on Friday, advocate-general Balai Ray had agreed to give the school time to convert its old fleet to LPG.        
	Why did the advocate general agree to the schools appeal when such a conversion, from diesel to LPG, cannot be allowed under law? demanded environmentalist Subhash Dutta. The government is clearly out to create chaos on the roads from August 1, through confusion over autos, and now buses.        
	The Supreme Court had in July 1998 directed that all commercial buses in Delhi  including school buses  be phased out once they crossed the 15-year barrier.

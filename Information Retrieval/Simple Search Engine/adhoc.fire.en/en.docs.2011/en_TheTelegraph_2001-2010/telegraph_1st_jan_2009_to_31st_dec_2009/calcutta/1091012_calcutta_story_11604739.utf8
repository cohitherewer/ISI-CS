The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Safety catch in couch-surf ouch
                                                                                                               Safety catch in couch-surf ouch
  - Home truths of house-guest highlighted by death of a Facebook friend          KARO CHRISTINE KUMAR                      A policeman in Rohan Prakash Yellore rsquo;s house  on Sunday. (Aranya Sen)                                
	The Facebook friendship of Rohan Prakash Yellore and Kathleen Mary OBryan ended with the death of the woman from Washington in the house of the Calcutta boy.        
	This should sound another warning note for social networking friends who take it too far without running basic checks, said a senior officer of the cyber crime cell of Calcutta police. The new-age crime cell is waking up to Facebook friendships, but it is clueless about couchsurfing.org.        
	In Hollywood hit The Holiday, two strangers agree to swap addresses  Cameron Diaz leaves her LA bungalow to Kate Winslet and heads off to Kates English countryside  after they meet on a home-exchange site. So far, this was Calcuttas only brush with cross-country house-swapping. But with online friendships being forged across continents every hour, hosting and being hosted is fast becoming a fad.        
	Couchsurfing.org, a worldwide hospitality exchange network with 1,437,248 members, has 400-odd people registered from Calcutta. The city figure has doubled in the past six months. Networking sites like Facebook and Orkut have similar communities with members wishing to couch surf to get a first-hand feel of the local culture.        
	A couch in virtual lingo could be any space that allows a traveller to put head to pillow  be it a sofa, bed or even a mat on the floor. A couch surfer can host a guest or guests if he has a couch to offer them. He can also surf and stay at another members home, for free.        
	Ask couch surfer Supratim, who will be hosting an Italian this month at his Dum Dum residence. The best way to get a taste of the citys flavour is by staying with a local family. Plus, it is cost-effective and one gets to make many friends. Supratim will travel to Goa this winter to couch-surf for a night at an Americans home.        
	But how does one trust the person he or she is putting up with or being put up by through couchsurfing.org, globalfreeloaders.com or hospitalityclub.org? One can never be absolutely sure about guest or host, admits Supratim.In March this year, a 29-year-old woman from Hong Kong travelled to Leeds in UK and was hosted by a 34 year-old Morocco national. She alleged she was raped during her stay.        
	Indrapramit Biswas, 26, became a couch surfer two years ago when he was working in Calcutta. Now based in Bangalore, and having hosted a surfer from Germany and another from northern Europe, he says: Most people, especially girls, feel that it is risky. But the website offers a referral process and testimonials, which I feel, are enough to stand by.        
	The official from the cyber crime cell doesnt think it is enough. Be safe rather than sorry. Run thorough checks and keep enough people posted about bringing online friends home, he advises.

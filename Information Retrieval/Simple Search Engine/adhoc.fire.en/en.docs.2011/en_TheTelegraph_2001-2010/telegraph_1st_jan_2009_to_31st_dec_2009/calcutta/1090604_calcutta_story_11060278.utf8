The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Power-cut warning for city 
                                                                                                               Power-cut warning for city 
  - Small comfort in Met office   forecast of normal weather          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	First the bad news. The city is set to face power cuts throughout Thursday, with CESC shutting down one of its mainstays on Wednesday evening after it sprung a leak.        
	The good news is that the weather will be normal and comfortable, according to the Met office.         
	A 250MW unit of our Budge Budge plant has been shut down for repairs. We will not be able to avoid power cuts on Thursday but we expect to get the unit up and running by Friday, said Dilip Sen, the executive director of CESC.        
	Power secretary Sunil Mitra said an all-out effort was being made to procure power from various sources to make up for the shortage.        
	Around 200MW of power could come from Chhattisgarh, sources said.        
	The CESCs 60MW unit in Titagarh, which was shut down for repairs on Monday, will also be switched on by Thursday morning.        
	We will have all other units running and seek around 600 MW from the state-owned distribution company. But we will still be short unless we get power from other sources, said a CESC official.        
	The citys power requirement remained above normal on Wednesday evening. Demand shot up to 1,474MW and the city and its adjoining areas suffered power cuts because of a 120MW shortfall, said a CESC official.         
	The duration of the power cuts ranged between one and one-and-a-half hours.        
	Officials of the West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd said all the state-run power plants would perform to capacity on Thursday, but the distribution network was such that it could not supply more power to the CESC grid even if it wanted to.        
	We can supply a maximum of around 600MW to the CESC grid, said an official.        
	The only comforting news came from the weatherman. The Met office said there was little chance of the maximum temperature rising over the next 24 hours. The maximum temperature on Wednesday was pegged at 35.5 degrees Celsius, which is normal.        
	We expect the maximum temperature on Thursday to be around 35 degrees Celsius, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the weather section at the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.        
	Met officials said the hot and dry wind that was blowing in from the western part of the country had stopped. A low-pressure belt over the north-west Bay has brought in loads of moisture from the sea. We expect scattered rainfall in Bengal from Thursday afternoon, said an official.

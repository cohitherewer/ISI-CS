The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Wife killed on Jamai Sashthi
                                                                                                               Wife killed on Jamai Sashthi
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 32-year-old homemaker accompanying her husband to her parents home on Jamai Sashthi died in a road mishap in Howrah.        
	Sadhana was riding pillion on Uttam Pallabs Royal Enfield bike, when it was hit from behind by a truck on National Highway 2.         
	The two had set out from their Belur Station Road home for Dankuni around 9.45pm. The mishap occurred near Maitripara crossing in Bally.         
	Both of them were flung off the bike. Sadhana sustained injuries on her head and started haemorrhaging. Uttam, 39, had a miraculous escape, said an officer of Bally police station.         
	The truck driver escaped. A police team took Sadhana to hospital, where she was declared dead on arrival.        
	Uttam, a trader, married Sadhana about two years ago.         
	Her parents alleged that she was murdered. According to a complaint lodged by Sadhanas brother Totan Das at Bally police station, the accident was staged to kill her.        
	She was subjected to torture and harassment by her husband and in-laws for dowry over the past year and a half. Uttam hired a truck driver to kill her. If it was a serious accident, why did he escape unhurt? asked Das.         
	The police picked up Uttam on Friday evening for questioning.        
	Our officers will also speak to his neighbours and family members to verify the allegations, said an investigating officer.         
	Fatal fall: Roshna Khatoon, 6, died after falling into a reservoir while playing hide-and- seek with other children at Lohamath, in the South Port police station area, late on Thursday.        
	The reservoir adjoins a garage near the ground where the children were playing.        
	One of the children saw Roshna, who lived in a nearby slum, falling into the reservoir and alerted her family members. The body was recovered around midnight.

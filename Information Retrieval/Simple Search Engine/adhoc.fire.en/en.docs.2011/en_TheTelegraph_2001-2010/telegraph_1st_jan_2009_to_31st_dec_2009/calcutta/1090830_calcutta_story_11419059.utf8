The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Woodcut grotesques
                                                                                                               Woodcut grotesques
                              A work by Rajesh Deb                            
	Size really matters in the case of Rajesh Deb, 30, an artist from Tripura, who had caught the eye with his huge woodcut prints. Gallery Rasa is holding an exhibition of his single-edition woodcut prints, unusually on canvas. Deb goes back to the heyday of woodcut prints in Bengal in the 19th century and the great tradition of Battala.         
	He often borrows images from them and presents them in a contemporary context. In Tagore Brain Oil, he appropriates images from Tagores drawings to accentuate the small-scale industry Bengalis have turned the Nobel-prize winning poet into.        
	Deb is a strong figurative artist and this is evident from his two men in the work titled Lover and the Martyr, the faces in Janagan and the two barebodied barrel-chested men in bright blue. His Janus-faced grotesques are powerfully structured. Deb should stick to such.                     SOUMITRA DAS

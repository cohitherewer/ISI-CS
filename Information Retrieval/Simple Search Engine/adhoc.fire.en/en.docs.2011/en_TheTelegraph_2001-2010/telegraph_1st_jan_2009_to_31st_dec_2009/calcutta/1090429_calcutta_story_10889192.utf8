The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Vote boycott over fee hike
                                                                                                               Vote boycott over fee hike
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Guardians of students studying in private schools in the city are ready to boycott the general election if the government does not stop schools from increasing fees steeply.        
	We know that the election is important but the future of the next generation is at stake. We will not vote if the government does not intervene, said Abhijit Sarkar, a member of the West Bengal Private Schools Guardians Federation.        
	The federation came together with Paschim Banga Yuva Kalyan Mancha and West Bengal Child Protection Cell on Tuesday to voice their stand on the fee hike issue. Over 200 parents of students of schools like Loyola, St Teresa and Meghamala Roy Education Centre attended the meet.        
	We have been hit by downturn and thought that the schools would not increase their fees this year. Not only did they increase the fees, they did so arbitrarily, added Sarkar.        
	The parents, who had met CPM and Trinamul leaders, want the school authorities and the state government to meet the representatives of the guardians forums.        
	Retired chief justice Samaresh Banerjee, the honorary chairman of the West Bengal Child Protection Cell, said minority schools had the right to increase fees but they must do so transparently and in consultation with guardians.        
	The parents who took part in Tuesdays programmes have decided to form a human chain on the Howrah bridge on Wednesday morning to protest the fee hike.

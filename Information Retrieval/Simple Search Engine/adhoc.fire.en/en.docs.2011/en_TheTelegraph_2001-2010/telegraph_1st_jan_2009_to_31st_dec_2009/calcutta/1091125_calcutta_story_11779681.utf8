The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Campus clash on poll-eve 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Campus clash on poll-eve 
  - College authorities batting for SFI, claims Team Trinamul          OUR BUREAU                                    
	A college on the northern fringes of the city erupted over the filing of nominations for students body elections amid growing murmurs of favouritism by several college principals, most of them being CPM appointees.        
	More than 30 students were injured as the clash at Panihati College, between SFI and Trinamul Chhatra Parishad supporters, spread from the campus to Sodepur Road and Panihati State General Hospital.        
	We had to fire one round in the air and use tear-gas shells to disperse the crowd. Later, we arrested two SFI supporters on charges of rioting and inciting violence, said a North 24-Parganas police officer, adding that Section 144 had been clamped on the campus and its adjacent areas.        
	Tuesdays campus violence over student elections comes within a week of similar clashes in the day section of the South City College and Behala College. A pointer to the fact that in poll season on campus, both parties are desperate to win over students before the 2011 big fight.        
	Students union bodies in more than 90 per cent colleges in and around Calcutta are under the SFIs control. Riding the wave of change blowing across Bengal, Trinamul is now posing a threat.        
	Opposition leader Partha Chatterjee visited Panihati later in the day and accused the local CPM of fanning violence on campus. Two Trinamul MLAs  Arjun Singh and Nirmal Ghosh  were present in the area when the supporters of the two students organisations had clashed.        
	SFI supporters accused their rivals of bringing outsiders into the campus and attacking them. But the Trinamul camp claimed that when their candidates turned up in college  an SFI stronghold for 22 years  to collect nomination forms for the elections scheduled on December 1, the SFI supporters attacked them.         
	For the past several years, SFI supporters have not even allowed opposition candidates to file nominations, said a Trinamul student leader.        
	The Trinamul Chhatra Parishad also accused the college principal of playing partisan politics to help the SFI retain control of the union, by allowing selective entry of outsiders into the campus.        
	Sanjoy Ghosh, principal of the college and an influential member of the CPMs North 24-Parganas district committee, rubbished the charges.        
	The neutrality of college authorities, directly under the control of Alimuddin Street, has been questioned by the Trinamul camp on several campuses, sparking clashes and unrest in the run-up to student body elections.

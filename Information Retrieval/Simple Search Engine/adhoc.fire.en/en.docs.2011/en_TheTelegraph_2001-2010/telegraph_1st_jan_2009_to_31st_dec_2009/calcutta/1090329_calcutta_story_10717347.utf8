The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cookie crumbles
                                                                                                               Cookie crumbles

	Some people hire a superstar to sell their products, some a leggy model and some an ugly-cute dog. Some others do something far more sinister  they use your nose. Shoppers at South City Mall will vouch for that. It has become virtually impossible to go to the mall, buy clothes, groceries or what you will and come out without your nostrils guiding to one little corner on the ground floor. There stands the cookie man, offering a mouth-watering, knee-weakening, soul-satisfying array of cookies, brownies, muffins and biscuits.         
	Such is its notoriety that one young woman was overheard on the escalator at the mall requesting her mother-in-law to drag her away from the cookie corner in case her nose and legs betrayed her. She was on a diet she said. Not to be outdone, the mom-in-law also said she was watching what she ate and there was no way she or her nose could be lured.        
	Last seen, the two women were stepping out of the mall carrying two packets of double chocolate-chip cookies, one bag of assorted cookies and a box of brownies.         
	Fire questionnaire        
	Fires happen with alarming frequency in summer when, for the past few years, the air turns bone dry. Last Friday itself, two fires broke out in central Calcutta.         
	It has been driven into our heads that we should inform either the police or the fire brigade if one has sighted either smoke or flames that are indicative of a blaze.         
	But that may not always be a very easy task. On Friday, when a fire broke out on the terrace of a Bentinck Street house, a good neighbour immediately dialled 1009, that is the police control room, from where the information is spread across the network.         
	But instead of thanking the caller for alerting them, the man who answered the call had a questionnaire ready. How did the fire happen? Where exactly did it happen? and somesuch. and on and on. The flames leapt higher.        
	Any publicity        
	A young woman walks into her dieticians chamber and starts whining for a crash diet. Shes a model, we learn, and she is distressed that she hasnt been working out lately.         
	Ami liquid diet-eo thakte parbo (I can survive on a liquid diet, too), she promises. The dietician is perturbed. Na, na, what if you faint at work? The newspapers would say model P collapses during photoshoot. he says.         
	But that would be even better! For us, any publicity is good, the woman replies promptly.         
	It must be tough being a faceless celebrity in the city.        
	Caution: vote ahead        
	An e-mail is doing the rounds on the Net on the nature of MPs, as a warning before the elections.         
	One day a florist goes for a haircut. After the cut, he asks the barber for his bill and the barber says: I cannot accept money from you. Im doing community service this week. When the barber goes to open his shop next morning there is a thank you card and a dozen roses at his door.         
	A professor comes in for a haircut, and when he tries to pay his bill, the barber says the same thing. The next morning, the barber finds a thank you card and a dozen different books, such as How to Improve Your Business and Becoming More Successful at his doorstep.         
	Then, a Member of Parliament comes in, and the barber says the same thing when he asks for the bill. The next morning when the barber goes to open up, there are a dozen MPs lined up waiting for a free haircut.         
	Vote carefully this summer.

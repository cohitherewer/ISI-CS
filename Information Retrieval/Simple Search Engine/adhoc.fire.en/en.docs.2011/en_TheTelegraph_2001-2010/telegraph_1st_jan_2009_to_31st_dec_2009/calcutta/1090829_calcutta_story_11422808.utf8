          ANASUYA BASU                          Upinder Singh at Presidency College on Friday. (Amit Datta)                                  
	Perhaps Upinder Singh likes it quiet. Though the invite for the launch of her book described her as Daughter of Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh, a couple of notices on the first floor of Presidency College only informed that a seminar at Bankim Hall on Friday afternoon was to be attended by her.         
	It was more of a presentation on her latest book, A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India, From Stone Age to the 12th Century, ahead of the launch of its paperback edition on Saturday.         
	An alumnus of and a former teacher at Delhis St Stephens, Singh, in a cream and maroon Dhakai sari, was visiting Presidency College for the first time. Copies of the 700-page tome were on display in front of the hall and available at a special discount.         
	History is not a subject that students opt for out of love. They take it up because it is an easy option and it helps them prepare for competitive exams, was Singhs candid observation at the two-hour presentation. More so ancient history, she felt.         
	While students can still connect with modern and to some extent medieval history, by the time they come to ancient history, they are all sleeping, she said.         
	None slept at Bankim Hall. Singh had to field questions for over an hour from students and teachers that ranged from the Aryan debate to current trends in historiography.         
	This was my first interaction with students on my book, said Singh, who is keen to have a similar session at Delhi University, where she is currently teaching.         
	Isnt it unusual to have an event around a single book on the campus?         
	To my knowledge this is the first time that we have had a seminar on a particular book. We generally have scholars delivering lectures on topics that help students understand the subject, agreed Jayashree Mukhopadhyay, the head of the history department.         
	The students made most of the visit. Said Rukmini Chakrabarty, student seminar secretary of the history department: With Upinder Maam here, we had an opportunity to get to know her views on the current trends in history writing.

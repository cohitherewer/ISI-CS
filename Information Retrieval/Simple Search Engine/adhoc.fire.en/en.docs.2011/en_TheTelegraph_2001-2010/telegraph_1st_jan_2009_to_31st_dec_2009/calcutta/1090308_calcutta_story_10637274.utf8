The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A country of second chances
                                                                                                               A country of second chances
										      made in manhattan                                           
	I was out of the country for a month and a half, but no matter where I went  Paris, Dubai or Calcutta  it was hard to get away from the US. Nearly every conversation I had with friends, family or even strangers at foreign airports was about America.         
	How are things there, people are losing jobs, it is really bad, right? And if the discussion moved away momentarily from the economic slowdown, it was only to question why the West loved Slumdog Millionaire (picture right), which according to many was an exploitative film focused solely on Indias poverty.         
	While I answered these queries as honestly as I could, I knew something was missing, something intangible that was important, which left the picture incomplete. Only when I came back I realised what it was.        
	This year the Oscars was about second chances. In the US, everyone was rooting for two one-time stars of the silver screen who had messed things up. They had destroyed their lives and their careers, with drugs, alcohol or other excesses but were now making a comeback.         
	Whether it was Tropic Thunders Robert Downey Jr, who years back had been nominated for Chaplin, or Mickey Rourke, who starred in a role which mirrored his real life in last years The Wrestler, people were thrilled by how they had pieced back their lives through sheer determination.         
	America is a nation of second chances.         
	As a newcomer in the US when the Internet boom was fizzling out, I used to be amazed by store signs that proudly proclaimed going out of business sale or feel sorry for a neighbour who had got laid off.         
	But I soon realised that none of this dampened the spirit  and that there is no shame in failing. In fact, failure is often a badge of honour, reflecting the willingness to take risks.         
	Success stories in the US are often rags-to-riches tales, whether it is about people behind corporations like Apple or Starbucks, or about actresses like Hilary Swank who used to live in a trailer park, or the new administrations future commerce secretary whose grandfather worked as a domestic help and father owned a grocery store.         
	Or, its about people who have made a comeback, like Al Gore who lost a hugely publicised election in 2000, only to reinvent himself and win a Nobel in 2007.         
	Even for the common man this belief in a turnaround is ingrained. They may loose their jobs and home but they know it is possible to reboot and restart.         
	From the immigrants who came from Europe to begin a new life to our neighbour who failed in his first business and set up another one, fresh starts happen every day.         
	More than 30 American newspapers, including the biggest ones like the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and the LA Times covered Slumdogs Oscar win on the front page.         
	Is the drive to succeed against all odds what they see in Jamal, the hero of Slumdog Millionaire? Sure, the film had the elements that Westerners love  Indian slums, Taj Mahal and even a call centre, encapsulated into a love story  but is it just that?        
	Maybe in times of economic peril, when people are losing jobs and families have less food on their dinner tables, a film like Slumdog appeals even more to Americans.         
	Having been through the civil war, fallout of the industrial revolution, Great Depression, oil crisis of the Seventies and the Internet bust, Americans have experienced financial upheavals many times before.         
	Each time the country has come out stronger. Even though this is the most challenging fiscal crisis in decades, there is a belief that the country will make a comeback. And this story too shall have a happy ending.       Oisika Chakrabarti   (The writer, a Calcuttan, works at the UN in Manhattan.

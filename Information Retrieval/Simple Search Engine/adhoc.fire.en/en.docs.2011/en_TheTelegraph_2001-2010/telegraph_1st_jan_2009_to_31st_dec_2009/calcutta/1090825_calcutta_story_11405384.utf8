The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Behind need for speed, IT foray
                                                                                                               Behind need for speed, IT foray

	The Vedic Village authorities have been buying land as they have expansion plans. But land mafia was involved and had been helping the Vedic Village people.  Ardhendu Sen, at Writers Buildings, on Monday.        
	If Sen made it appear that his government had little clue about the Vedic Village people, he was either turning a blind eye or he was bluffing.        
	For the Vedic Village people had been partners-in-arms with his government in a much-touted land-for-industry deal not so long ago.        
	So who are the Vedic Village people, who found themselves in the home secretarys line of fire the evening after a mob torched parts of the resort off Rajarhat and the day a cache of arms was recovered from the luxury address?        
	Raj Modi is the managing director of Vedic Realty, but the turning point, say realty insiders, came when he invited on board A.N. Shroff, of the Diamond Group consortium, to fast-track the land acquisition process for the expansion of Vedic Village.        
	The need for speed  or the alleged use of muscle power  in land deals was necessitated by Vedic Realtys foray into IT territory with Webel, the nodal IT and ITes agency of the government that Ardhendu Sen represents.        
	Raj Modi and his men spied an opening after Infosys and Wipro refused to buy Rajarhat land at Rs 2.16 crore per acre. They told the IT department they would directly purchase 1,000 acres of land from the farmers adjacent to Vedic Village. Of this, 500 acres would be given to Webel, which could sell it at a competitive rate to the IT majors.        
	So, a joint-venture company was floated between Modis Sanjeevani Projects Ltd and Webel, which would provide all infrastructure. Two MoUs were signed between Webel and Infosys and Wipro.        
	Vedic Village township will require an investment of Rs 25,000 crore over the next seven years. A 50:50 joint venture will be formed with Webel and the government will invest between Rs 300 and 500 crore in developing the townships infrastructure, Modi had claimed in March 2008.        
	In the wake of Nandigram, Singur and the downturn, Infosys has developed cold feet about its Calcutta plans, but both Modi and the IT department insist that the deal is on.        
	So, if Sen said at Writers on Monday that his government had come to know about one Mr Modi who is a director of Vedic Village, it means at best that the home secretary is ignorant, and at worst that he is lying.        
	Sen also claimed that the Vedic Village people were not acquiring land for any government project, though an IT township was being planned there. But the future of government projects planned there may get affected if the process of land purchase becomes murky, he added.        
	Villagers in the vicinity of Vedic Village told Metro that matters became murky after the Modi-Shroff combine resorted to forcible land acquisition. Amarnath Shroff was using aggregators like Gaffar to grab land from the farmers, alleged a government official.        
	Vedic Village meanwhile is busy with its Phase II, christened Kolkata Links, a high-end luxury villa project with a golf course.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Methodical schizophrenia at 85
                                                                                                               Methodical schizophrenia at 85 
										      eyewitness                         A fibreglass head and terracotta relief (below) by K.G. Subramanyan on view at Seagull Arts and Media Resources Centre                                 
	K.G. Subramanyans creativity is marked by the coexistence of disparate, contradictory and often incompatible elements that jostle and struggle with each other and seem to be in a constant state of turbulence.         
	These may be classic symptoms of schizophrenia, but when one views the paintings, sculpture and terracottas of the artist, who has turned 85, being exhibited simultaneously at the Seagull Arts amp; Media Resources Centre, Aakriti Art Gallery and Akar Prakar, one realises that this is his way of breaking all barriers  between mental states, countries and received traditions, both hieratic and demotic, and modern art movements and their great exponents in the West.         
	Subramanyan has been for years trying to rein in his creative genius by keeping himself busy creating art works that demand the use of his hands and his power of observation. He makes no distinction between living rooms of middle class Indians, familiar neighbourhoods in Santiniketan and the mental space peopled by gods, goddesses and beasts straight out of the myths.         
	His creativity seems to have an all-consuming hunger for all cultures, all spaces, all mental states and all peoples. So it does not come as a surprise when we see  as in the current series  his Durga in the garb of a Minoan goddess, a sexy Valkyrie from a sci-fi serial, unhinged men and women, the demon turned snarling cat, masks, or a grand African woman holding a sickle as in the Reaper  all in the same frame.        
	Which is why there is always a great sense of agitation and frenzied, dramatic action in his paintings, particularly his large canvases and magnificent reverse paintings.         
	Part of this delirious activity stems from the highly-sexed protagonists of his paintings. Even the birds and beasts are in a constant state of arousal, ever ready for a romp in the hay. One can imagine the scholar Subramanyan as the detached viewer smiling at this uncontrolled animation and concupiscence.         
	This drollness adds a sparkle to his works.         
	Of course, Subramanyan has been doing this, as many viewers may observe, for ages, and those not easily impressed should see his large reverse paintings (49x73), latest terracotta works and the biggish fibreglass head spotted like a leopard  iridescent green spots, in this case, one should hasten to add.         
	Two short poems in the catalogue of the four square terracotta reliefs (30x30 each) composed of nine smaller squares provide a clue to what the artist had in mind while working on them. As in his paintings, these are disjointed, scattered fragments of distorted bodies  And each man sees his neighbour/A monster in human dress  mirror images and a note of wonder  Then, when your jaws fall open You see your ribbed and restless tongue/ That unfolds its fleshy body.        
	What is worth noting in these reliefs is the facility with which Subramanyan manipulates and moulds clay like putty, giving shape to the boneless limbs, the scarred and lined faces with toothy grins and rolls of clay that rears up like a rising reptile.        
	In contrast, the solitary, painted, multifaceted head of man has the repose of classical sculpture similar to the bronzes from Benin in its dignity and calm. Actually moulded out of fibreglass it has a dull sheen and mottled skin similar in colouring to verdigris. When one has seen all the three exhibitions at the three galleries, one is left wondering, who is the real K.G. Subramanyan  of the paintings, of the caricature-like terracotta reliefs, or of the man with the noble head? We are left with a fractured view both of the man and the artist.       SD

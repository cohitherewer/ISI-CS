The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Custody death report
                                                                                                               Custody death report
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The post-mortem on Shambhu Das, 23, who was found hanging in the Alipore police station lock-up on Sunday, suggested he committed suicide.         
	A scratch was detected on the body, but it was at least seven days old and did not suggest foul play. Instead, the injuries on his neck showed Das had hanged himself, said an officer of the homicide wing of the detective department.        
	Das was arrested on July 17 on charges of stealing. After his death, his family accused the police of torturing him. Two cops were suspended for dereliction of duty and and the officer-in-charge of the police station was transferred and a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder started against him.        
	The post-mortem report, however, failed to reach the cops on Tuesday because of the traffic chaos in the city centre. It is expected to reach Lalbazar on Wednesday. City detective chief Jawed Shamim said: We will submit the findings in court and seek permission to close the case.

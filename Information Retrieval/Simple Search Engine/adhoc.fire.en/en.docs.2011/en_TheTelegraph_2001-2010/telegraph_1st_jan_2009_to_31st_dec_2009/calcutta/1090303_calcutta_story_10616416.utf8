                                                                                                               Boys in dock for gang rape denied bail
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The three youths accused of raping a 21-year-old friend on February 8 were denied bail on Monday.        
	At the Alipore court, their judicial custody was extended till the next court appearance on March 16.        
	According to the complaint filed by the third-year student of a private engineering college in Calcutta, Rishin Sengupta, 22, Saptarshi Sanyal, 21, and Tanmoy Mayukh Borai, 21, had raped her after she was called over for a get-together to a Santoshpur flat and drugged.        
	The three students of reputable institutes in the city were arrested on February 15 and charged under sections 342, 328, 376, 109, 114 and 120B of the IPC for wrongful confinement, administration of sedatives/drugs, rape, abetment and criminal conspiracy.        
	Santanu Dutta, one of the lawyers representing the boys, said on Monday that Tanmoy, Rishin and Saptarshi were being falsely implicated.        
	He claimed that the case against his clients did not have any scientific basis since the medical test and the forensic examination had not provided any evidence.        
	In her FIR on February 14,  a copy of which is with Metro  the girl stated that on February 9, Tanmoy had taken her to the doctor and the morning after, he had accompanied her home to Malda.        
	Metro has proof of the e-tickets used by Tanmoy and the girl to board the B-1 coach (AC 3-tier) from Sealdah to Malda early on February 10.        
	The boys legal team questioned why she would accompany one of the boys she had named as her assailant first to a doctor and then back home to Malda.        
	Dutta told the court that the girl had slapped false charges against the three boys to teach them a lesson.        
	In the FIR, the girl from Malda who lives in a mess in Jadavpur, said she had been invited by Tanmoy and Saptarshi, who were flatmates in Santoshpur, for a get-together of common friends. Rishin, a resident of Baguiati, was among those present.        
	She accused the boys of offering her a spiked soft drink  after having which her arms and legs became numb  and then raping her repeatedly.         
	They are bright students with a bright future and should not be kept in jail, pleaded Dutta.        
	Investigation is at an early stage and so the accused must not be given bail, argued Jayabrata Aich, representing the girl.

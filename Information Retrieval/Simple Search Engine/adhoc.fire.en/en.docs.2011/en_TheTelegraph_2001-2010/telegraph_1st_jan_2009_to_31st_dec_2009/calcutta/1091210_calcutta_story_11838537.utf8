          OUR BUREAU                           A Sukhoi 30 fighter plane                                  
	A fleet of Sukhoi 30s will blaze a trail in the Calcutta sky on December 14 and 15 as part of the Vijay Diwas celebrations.         
	The Russian warplanes  the latest entrants into the Eastern Command  would fly down from the Tejpur airbase in Assam, show off aerial acrobatics and fly back.         
	This would be followed by helicopters dropping paratroopers to the RCTC ground, said Major-general Munish Sibal of the Eastern Command Headquarters.        
	Vijay Diwas commemorates the victory of the Indian armed forces over Pakistan on December 16, 1971, which led to the creation of Bangladesh. Freedom fighters from Bangladesh are invited to take part in the programme.        
	The Eastern Command was at the forefront of the war for Bangladeshs liberation, so this occasion is of great significance. We want Calcuttans to witness the gallantry of the armed forces. Last time, almost 5,000 people watched the show. This year, we want to double the number, said an officer of the Eastern Command.        
	The show will be of interest to children in particular. Remembering past success helps in attaining success in future, added the officer.        
	The other highlights would include a 10-minute mock raid by military commandos. There would also be hot air ballooning, sky diving, standing salute on horses and beating the retreat.         
	The celebrations will continue from December 12 to 16. Fourteen Mukti Jodhas and three service officers from Bangladesh will join the programmes.        
	On December 14 and 15, the tattoo and band display, from 3pm to 6pm, would be open to everyone.

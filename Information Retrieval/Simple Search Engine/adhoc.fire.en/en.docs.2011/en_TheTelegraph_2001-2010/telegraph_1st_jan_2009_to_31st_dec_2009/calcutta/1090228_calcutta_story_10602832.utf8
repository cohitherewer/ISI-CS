          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	INFOGEN Global is not the only dud firm operating out of Sector V. A probe by the Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority, which looks after administrative matters of the tech hub, has revealed the existence of a few more such firms.        
	Stung by the INFOGEN scam that has affected around 1,200 employees, the authority has formed a three-member panel to conduct a door-to-door survey in Sector V. The survey is still in its initial stages but we have found a few other IT firms that are operating without a trade licence, said Badri Narayan Kar, the executive officer of the authority.        
	Kar said the authority had given trade licences to 400-odd firms. The survey has come across a few companies that had applied for the licence but started operations without waiting for the papers to arrive. The firms would be sent notices. If they fail to give satisfactory replies, we will close them down, said Kar.        
	The chairman of the Authority, S.A. Ahmed, said the panel would submit its report in two months. We are verifying whether the firms have stuck to their original business plans or have shifted to some other business after getting the authoritys clearance, said Ahmed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CU fix for student unrest
                                                                                                               CU fix for student unrest
        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Calcutta University will hand out academic calendars with undergraduate admission forms from this year, listing everything that freshers need to know about college education but dont bother to ask.         
	The proposal comes in the wake of unrest in several colleges where students with low attendance have been debarred from writing examinations.         
	We are used to students feigning ignorance about the existence of a particular rule whenever it is enforced. This calendar will rob them of their favourite excuse, a senior university official said.         
	Students only need to check the calendar to know everything they need to know to plan their year  the dates when admission forms will be accepted, commencement of classes, distribution and submission of annual examination forms, deadlines for changing subjects and streams, tentative dates for examinations and announcement of results and schedules for internal class tests.         
	It will also list the eligibility norms for writing university examinations, including the minimum attendance required and the pass marks in internal tests.         
	The calendar will be finalised during the undergraduate councils meeting on May 18, Calcutta Universitys pro vice-chancellor of academic affairs, Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee, said.         
	A recent survey of students attendance in colleges affiliated to the university revealed that less than 60 per cent of them attend classes regularly. Many colleges award 10 to 15 per cent grace attendance to students so that they do not lose a year but the university has become strict lately, triggering unrest in several institutions.         
	Students debarred from writing the Part I undergraduate examinations because of inadequate attendance or low marks in selection tests assaulted the principal of Jogamaya Devi College last month. First-year students of Muralidhar Girls College had gheraoed their principal from morning till late in the night a few days earlier. At City College, 295 students were allowed to sit for Part I after they laid siege to the principals office for over 24 hours.         
	Once students are given the academic calendar, we will not listen to any excuse, said a college principal.         
	Admission to undergraduate courses is scheduled to start in the first week of June after the results of various Class XII board examinations are declared. The university is likely to retain last years eligibility criteria, including the minimum cut-off marks. Colleges will, however, be at liberty to raise the cut-off.        
	Students from any stream or board  Higher Secondary, ISC or CBSE  are required to mention the marks scored in their best four subjects in the application forms.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Warehouses destroyed in fire 
                                                                                                               Warehouses destroyed in fire 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A fire broke out in two adjoining warehouses in an industrial estate at Nababpatti, Chitpur, early on Thursday.         
	The blaze started in a 1,500sq ft warehouse  stacked with crockery, ghee, posters, textbooks and dry food  and spread to the other godown, covering 1,000 sq ft, where kitchen appliances were stored. The two were separated by a plywood wall.        
	The guard in the compound spotted the blaze around 4am and called the fire brigade, said Pradip Bansal, whose kitchen appliances were stocked in one of the warehouses.        
	Five fire tenders reached the spot around 4.45am. Five more were sent around 5.15am. The fire was controlled around 11am.        
	Fire department officers said the smoke was so dense that despite wearing breathing apparatuses, they had to come out of the rooms at short intervals.        
	I think the blaze started at night, said Bivas Guha, the divisional fire officer.        
	The cause of the blaze is yet to be ascertained. The absence of electricity in the warehouses ruled out the possibility of a short-circuit.        
	We have not been able to ascertain the extent of loss. I think there was some foul play behind the fire, added Bansal.

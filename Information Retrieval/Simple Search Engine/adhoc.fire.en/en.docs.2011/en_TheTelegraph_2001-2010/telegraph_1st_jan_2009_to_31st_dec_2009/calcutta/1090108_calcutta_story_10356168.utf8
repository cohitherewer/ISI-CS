                      Ethnic pottery for modern living                    One of the most ancient and popular art forms of Bengal, terracotta refers to baked earth or clay that is dried and cast, molded, or hand worked into a desired shape. For centuries, artisans of Bengal have been making terracotta items of daily use as well as decoration ranging from kulhars to toys and deities. The temples of Bishupur and the typically styled Bankura horses are the finest examples of this craft. Committed to the revival of this now dying art form, Confetti Exports is engaged in supporting its artisans as well as ensuring that their products find the appreciation they deserve. In its efforts to nurture the skills of local artisans, specially women, and to help revive an ethnic art form, Confetti helps them transform traditional wares to suit contemporary lifestyles. At present, 35 artisans, including 10 women, have been trained to create various aesthetically attractive items using traditional techniques.

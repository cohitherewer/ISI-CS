The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Boy dies after scuffle with friend
                                                                                                               Boy dies after scuffle with friend
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 12-year-old boy died on Wednesday night, a day after getting into a fight with a friend from his locality in Agarpara. The cause of Biswajit Deys death is yet to be known.        
	Khardah police have detained the other boy, 10-year-old Prabal (name changed to protect the minors identity).        
	Biswajits neighbour Arati Biswas said the two boys had quarrelled over bathing in the two ponds in their locality, Matangini Hazra Pally.        
	Biswajit had warned Prabal not to bathe in one of the ponds as it belonged to his relative while Prabal asked Biswajit not to venture near the other pond. Biswajit then taunted Prabal for getting scared by his threats, Arati said.        
	Biswajits father Biswanath works in a hosiery factory while Prabals father is a taxi driver.         
	Family members said that on Tuesday afternoon Biswajit had gone to attend a Sitala puja close to Prabals house. Prabal spotted him there and attacked him. Both rained fists and blows on each other, injuring themselves. I had accompanied Biswajit to the puja, said Asit Banerjee, Biswajits friend who studies in Class X in a local school.        
	After the scuffle, Biswajit returned home and complained to mother Ruma of pain on the right side of the face. We didnt realise what was wrong. He said Prabal had punched him in the face and I gave him a painkiller, sobbed Ruma, a homemaker.         
	Things turned worse on Wednesday afternoon when Biswajit started vomiting. He also complained of severe itching and started scratching himself all over.         
	Soon after, he fainted and was taken to NRS Medical College and Hospital. He died on Wednesday night. We are not sure how Biswajit died. A probe suggests Prabal could not be held directly responsible for the death. We are awaiting the post-mortem report and probing the case from all angles, said an officer.

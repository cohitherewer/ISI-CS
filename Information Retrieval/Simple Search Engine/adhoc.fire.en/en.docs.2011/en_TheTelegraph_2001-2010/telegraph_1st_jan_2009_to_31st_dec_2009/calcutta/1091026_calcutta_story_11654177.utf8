The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Besu steel for lighter wheels
                                                                                                               Besu steel for lighter wheels
          ANASUYA BASU                          The Bengal Engineering and Science University gate                                  
	Bengal Engineering and Science University has embarked on a project to make high-strength, lightweight steel that can be used to manufacture more fuel-efficient cars.        
	The steel ministry will provide Rs 6 crore and Tata Steel Rs 28.20 lakh for the endeavour, deemed a national project for expertise augmentation.        
	The objective of the project is to develop strong, ductile and lightweight steel that will reduce the weight of cars and thereby lower their fuel consumption while meeting safety norms, said N.R. Bandopadhyay of the universitys School of Material Sciences.        
	Such steel is already being used in the West by companies like Nissan, Chrysler and GM.         
	The technology is closely guarded and not available to Indian companies, said a Tata Steel spokesperson.        
	Customers are now asking for larger cars with luxury, comfort and safety features. To ensure these, we need high-grade steel, which currently means thick, high gauge conventional steel. But this type of steel adds to the weight of the vehicle and affects its fuel economy, he said.        
	Bandopadhyay felt the futuristic, innovative product development initiative would directly benefit the steel producers and ultimately the car manufacturers.         
	The project has found many supporters in the automobile industry. We are glad that the university is researching on advanced high-strength steel, which will help save energy. Car makers across the world are now looking for high-strength steel with low thickness and low weight, said an official of Tata Motors.

  - Rishensi death case reopened in bid to nail callous cops          A STAFF REPORTER                          Rashi and Punit Horo in Lalbazar on Monday. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                        
	Punit and Rashi Horos search for their missing daughter may have ended in tragedy but their quest for justice continues, forcing Lalbazar to reopen the case.        
	The distraught parents of Rishensi Neha Horo, 15, met detective chief Damayanti Sen on Monday to demand action against the police officers who failed to inform them about their daughter being found dead and cremated as an unidentified body almost four months ago.        
	Metro reported on Monday how Rishensis parents were kept in the dark about her death by the callousness of cops.        
	I could not cremate the body of my daughter, whose body was found on August 2 by officials of Belur GRP, because of negligence on the part of police officers, Rashi, a schoolteacher, said in her complaint.        
	A senior officer said the entire missing squad had been put on notice. They have been asked to submit all documents relevant to the case.        
	The main allegation against the police is that they didnt bother acting on an alert from the railway police about a girls body matching Rishensis description being found along the rail tracks on August 2. The Class X students parents learnt about her death on Saturday after seeing her clothes.        
	Detective chief Sen, whom the Horos had earlier met on October 3, promised to investigate the case afresh to ascertain whether it was a murder or accident. The Horos insist that somebody was with our daughter at the time of her death.         
	Rishensi had stepped out of her Taratala home for the last time on July 31.

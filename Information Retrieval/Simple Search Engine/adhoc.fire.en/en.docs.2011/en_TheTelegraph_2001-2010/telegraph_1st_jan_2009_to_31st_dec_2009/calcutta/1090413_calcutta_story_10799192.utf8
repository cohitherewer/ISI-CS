The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Roadshow by realtors in Silicon Valley
                                                                                                               Roadshow by realtors in Silicon Valley
          SUBHRO SAHA                              
	City realtors are set to woo the non-resident Bengali community in recession-hit North America with their first comprehensive real estate roadshow in that part of the world.        
	Credai Bengal, the state chapter of the national umbrella body of real estate developers, will hold the realty expo during the North American Bengali Conference (NABC), scheduled for July 2-4 in San Jose.        
	We have been going to the NABC every year in bits and pieces, and we felt that doesnt do justice to the real potential of the city as an investment destination and the wide array of real estate products now available here. Hence the decision to stage a full-fledged show, says Pradeep Sureka, the president of Credai Bengal.        
	With fears of job loss and pay cuts casting a pall of gloom over the US economy, many NRIs are seriously contemplating returning to their roots sooner than they had envisaged and this has fuelled demand for flats back home, feels the realtors body.        
	The NABC is a great opportunity to reach out to the large number of Bengalis settled in the US. More so, since the location is the Silicon Valley this time, a traditional bastion of Bengali IT professionals, says Santosh Rungta, a senior city developer who has taken over as the president of Credais national committee.        
	Around 10 developers have confirmed participation with a basket of a dozen-odd products, and the Credai Bengal brass is hopeful many more will join the Silicon Valley roadshow, once the marketing for the July event gathers momentum.        
	Besides the residential segment, we are also anticipating a large participation from IT infrastructure providers, simply because the show is in Silicon Valley, adds Sureka. Efforts are on to convince Writers Buildings to use this opportunity to underline some of the core strengths of the state to the NRI Bengalis in the US.        
	Around 4,000 visitors enquired about Indian properties on show at the Dubai realty expo last year. Here, we can reach out to 10,000 NRI Bengalis focused on buying properties in Calcutta, says Pradip Chopra of the PS Group, the past secretary of Credai Bengal.

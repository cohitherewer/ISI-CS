                    Morning ragas                    As autumn gives way to winter, the city will be inundated with eminent artistes paying homage to this cultural epicentre of Indian classical music. Tradition plays a strong hand in this pristine art form and over the years, various Gharanas present their finest renditions before the citys discerning music aficionados. In this deluge of music concerts that Calcutta is soon expected to witness, evening performances and night-long conferences will tend to dominate. Sangeet Ashram offers a refreshing change from the usual trend, with a bouquet of morning ragas to be presented by eminent vocalist Vidushi Shruti Sadolikar, who will be accompanied by Mangesh Muley on the tabla. A proud torch-bearer of the Jaipur Autrauli Gharana, she was groomed by her father, the celebrated Pandit Wamanrao Sadolikar, who was himself a disciple of Ustad Alladiya Khan, founder of the Gharana. An exponent of rare bandishes of the Jaipur Gharana and of a number of compositions in rare and complex ragas, she will give the audience the splendid opportunity to experience the changing shades of the morning through her melodies. Beginning with the sombre raga Bhairav, she will move on to raga Asavari and the more serious raga Todi, and then on to the playful raga Gaud Sarang as noon approaches.                    lEvent: Classical vocal recital by Shruti Sadolikar lWhen: Tomorrow at 10.30 am lWhere: G.D.

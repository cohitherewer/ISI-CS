                      Enigmatic images                    Contemporary Indian art can be both symbolic and representative, lyrical and narrative, illusory and realistic. Trying to make sense of it all, the ongoing art exhibition, brings together the works of four artists, who, in their own way, portray their impressions of life and time through complex and magical, yet astonishingly purposeful and grounded images. Debraj Goswamis works are a synthesis of symbols that offer a critique of technological progress. His fascinating and challenging imagery stem from the revelations of the mysteries of the visible world. Somit Guptas paintings operate on levels of fancy and play, achieving their effects through the use of a strange combination of bright and brooding colours and a quirky, private and sometimes confrontational imagery. His works observe and interpret the modern urban condition, selecting images firmly connected to social realities. Rajiba Lochan Pani (a painting by him appears here) uses the canvas as a physical and and conceptual space for the exploration and communication of political beliefs and, ultimately, the desire for social change. His works depict inhabitants of a land where traditional hierarchies are being rapidly transformed and people are losing touch with the environment. Pampa Panwar goes beyond contemporary iconography to suggest a world of dubious morality and danger. Her works comment on false identities being forged through localised conflicts and rapid realignment of disparate cultures.                    lEvent: An exhibition of paintings by four artists lWhen: Till July 15; 11 am - 7 pm lWhere: Ganges Art Gallery, 33A Jatin Das Road

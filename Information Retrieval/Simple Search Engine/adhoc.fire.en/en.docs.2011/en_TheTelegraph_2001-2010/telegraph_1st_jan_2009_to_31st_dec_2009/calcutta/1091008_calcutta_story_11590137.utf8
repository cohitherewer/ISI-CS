The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Onion price spells tears
                                                                                                               Onion price spells tears

	O for onion, O for overpriced.        
	The price of onions, known to make and unmake governments, is on an ominous ascent up the price charts with no sign of a let-up.        
	On Wednesday, onions were being sold for Rs 28-32 per kg, a jump of Rs 10 in four days. On Saturday, onions were going for Rs 18 per kg.        
	Reeling under the rising rates of potatoes, sugar, pulses and other essential edible items, the onion price is threatening to reduce consumers to tears.        
	The onion is such an essential item that one cannot do without it. Even till last week the price was between Rs 16 and Rs 18, but post-Lakshmi puja it has skyrocketed. I dont know how I will manage my household budget this festive month, said Mitali Chatterjee, a homemaker on BB Ganguly Street.        
	There is more bad news for the likes of Chatterjee. Wholesale markets warn that onion prices will soar in the coming weeks because of diminishing supply in the wake of the floods in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. Markets in Calcutta depend on Andhra, Karnataka and Nashik in Maharashtra for onions.        
	Though the supplies from Nashik are steady throughout the year, between August and December 70 per cent of the onions come from Andhra and Karnataka. No lorries have been loaded there in the past few days because of the floods and that could push up prices in the run-up to Diwali, said Gautam Sinha of the Co-ordination Committee of the Onions Merchants Association of Greater Calcutta.         
	Some 500 lorries loaded with onions are stranded and rotting in the Bangalore rains, he added.        
	Every week, five to six railway wagons full of onions arrive in Calcutta from Nashik. Every wagon has 36,000 packets of almost 45kg each. From the southern states, 700 to 800 lorries arrive in Calcutta and its suburbs every week, loaded with 300 packets of 50kg each.        
	Now, not even 20 lorries are arriving in the city, widening the demand-supply gap, said Vikas Narayan Agarwal, a wholesaler in Posta.         
	Boosting the Nashik supply line is also not an option now because loading there has already slowed down in the countdown to the Assembly elections in Maharashtra, starting October 13.        
	The price of the potato, meanwhile, remains high despite several government moves. On Wednesday, it ranged from Rs 20 to 23 per kg.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | The wonder that is India
                                                                                                               The wonder that is India

	Ramchandra Guha courts controversy. In fact, he thrives on it. Why else would he for no reason take on Arundhati Ray in an article and tell her that she should stick to fiction rather than espousing environmental causes.         
	Guha did it again, this time in Calcutta for a talk, presented by The Telegraph, on Why India is the most interesting country in the world at Starmark in South City Mall on Wednesday. He stood in the Bengal capital and practically decimated one of its most revered icons, Subhash Chandra Bose.         
	Hey Ram! But then thats Ram Guha for you. Intense, prolific, full of energy, vitality and yes, controversy.         
	Starting off his talk Guha  who was introduced as a historian, an environmentalist, a columnist and a Bangalorean with a Bengali surname but who is not a Bengali  narrated anecdotes off the cuff to show how India is interesting to a writer.         
	I was invited to an annual book fair in Kerala by one of its leading publishers, DC Books. There, amid big and small publishers, was this little shop selling Rajasthani achars (pickles) in open glass jars.         
	When I asked the fellow in the achar shop how he came to be there, he said: Maine suna yahan mela wela lag raha hai, to maine ek dukan de di (I heard that there was going to be a fair here, so I took a stall). Such a bewilderingly interesting thing (a Rajasthani acharwala finding a place in a Kerala book fair) could only happen in a magical country like India, said Guha.         
	While Guha was travelling from Patiala to Amritsar by road he came across a town called Khanna and saw a signboard of Indian Bank, Khanna Branch, HO: Rajaji, Chennai. What intrigued Guha was that a chicken-eating whisky-guzzling farmer of Punjab was banking with an austere, rasam-drinking vegetarian banker of Chennai.         
	It is in these contradictions, these juxtapositions that Guha finds his country.         
	It is a remarkable country with remarkable people, he said while speaking about Shivaram Karanth who is to Karnataka what Tagore is to Calcutta.        
	Karanth, the father of the modern Kannada novel, lived in Saligram near Mangalore and championed the cause of biodiversity of the Western Ghats.         
	He also revived the Yakshagana dance and was also involved with the cleaning up of the Tungabhadra river. A multifaceted talent that could have only lived and thrived in India.         
	It was in the question and answer session that the historian was accosted with the issue of Bose and nation-building.         
	Guhas unequivocal answer: Subhash Bose was flirting with dictators like Stalin and Hitler. We do not know what Bose would have done in democracy... if he would have given up on militarism and violence we dont know, he died.         
	Thats Ramchandra Guha for you, taking the bull by the horn or in this case, the Bose fan club.                     ANASUYA BASU

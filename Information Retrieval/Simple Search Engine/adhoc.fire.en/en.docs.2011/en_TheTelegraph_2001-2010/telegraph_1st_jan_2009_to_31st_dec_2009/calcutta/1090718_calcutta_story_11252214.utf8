                      Bards songs for the Bengali stage                    It was as early as 1809 when Claude Monckton partially translated and adapted Shakespeares The Tempest into Bengali. Since then, the works of Shakespeare have continued to bear relevance to the literature and theatre of Bengal, as well as gaining wide popularity among the audience. Besides the influence of colonialism, playwrights have consistently adapted Shakespearean plays for the Bengali stage for the last two centuries. Mahakabir Manchagaan will feature a representative selection of songs from Shakespeares plays adapted or translated meaningfully for the Bengali stage, along with comparison of the original Shakespearean lyrics and narratives related to it. Spread over the 19th and 20th centuries, they include compositions by Dinabandhu Mitra, Girish Chandra Ghose, Jyotirindranath Tagore, Dwijendralal Roy, Jyotindranath Sengupta, Sunil Kumar Chattopadhyay, Utpal Dutt and Ali Zaker (Bangladesh). Helping to keep alive Shakespearean heritage in Bengal, the programme also brings into focus the incidence of cross-culture in our theatre, where indigenous and alien approaches were compelled to confront each other. Participants: Riddhi Bandyopadhyay and Devajit Banyopadhyay (songs); Soumitra Chattopadhyay and Ananda Lal (narration).

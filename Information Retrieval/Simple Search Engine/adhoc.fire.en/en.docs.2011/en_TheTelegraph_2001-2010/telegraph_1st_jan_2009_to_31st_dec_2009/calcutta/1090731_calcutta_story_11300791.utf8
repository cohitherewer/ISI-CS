The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Century before debut
                                                                                                               Century before debut
  - Love Aaj Kal releases with 100 plex shows          PRATIM D. GUPTA                          Saif Ali Khan and Deepika Padukone in Love Aaj Kal                                        
	Love Aaj Kal has hit a century even before its release. The much-awaited Imtiaz Ali (Jab We Met) romance, starring Saif Ali Khan and Deepika Padukone, will arrive in the city on Friday with a whopping 100 daily shows at the multiplexes. Thats the biggest plex release for a movie in Calcutta.        
	Given the hype, we decided to go as big as possible, says city distributor Lokesh Mukut of MM Moviez. We are releasing Love Aaj Kal across 45 screens in and around Calcutta and the focus is on the plexes because it is a very urban story.        
	The crowds have responded. Besides the healthy advances, the corporate bookings for the film have been big. More than 5,000 tickets have already been blocked at Fame (South City), INOX (Forum) and INOX (City Centre) by companies, some for their employees, some for their customers.         
	The buzz around Love Aaj Kal is excellent. The fresh Saif-Deepika pairing, the hit music, the controversy over Kareena being left out from the cast this is the film to watch, feels Sonali Shroff, the head of corporate communications, Shringar Cinemas.        
	Partly set in Calcutta, Saifs first home production tries to compare the love of kal (1960s) and aaj (now). It feels nice to know that people are queuing up to watch the film there, Imtiaz tells Metro. Some of the most romantic parts of the film have been shot in Calcutta.

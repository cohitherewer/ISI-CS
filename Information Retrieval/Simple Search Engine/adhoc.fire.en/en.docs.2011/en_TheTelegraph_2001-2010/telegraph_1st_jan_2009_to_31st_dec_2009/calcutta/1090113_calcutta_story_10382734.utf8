The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cash flow slows down hall revamp
                                                                                                               Cash flow slows down hall revamp
          ON THE SPOT - DEROZIO HALL                              (From top) Revamp work in process in Derozio Hall (picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha); Nobel laureate Guenter Grass at an interaction at the same venue (a file picture)				       FACT FILE      Derozio Hall was set up in 1968. It was popularly known as Baker Hall  The two-tier auditorium has a capacity of 1,200 seats  An interaction with Nobel laureate Guenter Grass was one of the high-profile events hosted in Derozio Hall                                
	The Presidency College annual fest, Milieu, got over on Saturday and the students are getting ready for Founders Day on January 20  all at Derozio Hall, amidst the clutter of bamboo structures, walls half covered with plyboard and aluminium sheets, and construction materials dumped on the floor.         
	For the first time in its 41 years, the prestigious Derozio Hall is getting a facelift but the renovation work is dragging because of sporadic funding.         
	Initiated by the college authorities with the promise of funds from the department of higher education, the renovation had a three-point agenda  improving the halls acoustics, installing air-conditioners and converting the electrical wiring from external to internal.         
	The department of higher education had sanctioned around Rs 84 lakh for the entire project. Work began in end-2007 and continued till March 2008 with about Rs 12 lakh of the Rs 35 lakh slotted for acoustics.         
	From March 2008 to January 2009, the hall has been lying in the same state, with a dysfunctional sound system and a maze of bamboo, plyboard and aluminium sheets gracing the walls.         
	We had to stop work in March 2008 as funds for the electrical work hadnt been released. The money was disbursed only a couple of months back, said A. Sengupta, the executive engineer of central Calcutta division (division I) of the public works department (PWD).         
	The 1,200-seater, two-tier Derozio Hall is infamous for its howling  the walls throw back the sound, producing a garble of words.         
	Derozio Hall doesnt have an integrated sound system and so it echoes. There is a howling effect when we play instruments, with sounds from various instruments getting jumbled up. Musicians find it very difficult to coordinate, said Somjit Chatterjee, an ex-student who will perform in the Founders Day choir.         
	The sounds get so distorted that we can only understand that something is being said. We cant follow the words, added Souma Mandal, a student.         
	The sound from the stage is distinctly audible only to those in the first few rows. The problem has persisted since the hall was opened five decades back. But it hasnt stopped the college authorities from hosting several high-profile events in the auditorium.         
	According to the original plan, Derozio Hall was supposed to be air-conditioned but the government never got that done. The acoustics were never good. Minor repairs, like changing the stage, back screen and seats, have happened but no major renovation work has been taken up till now, said Amal Kumar Mukhopadhyay, who was the principal of Presidency College from 1991 to 1997.         
	The hall renovation process was initiated during former principal Mamata Roys tenure.        
	One of the reasons why the acoustics are so bad is because there are ceiling fans. Air-conditioners will solve this problem. Currently, we are holding all functions under these conditions, said principal Sanjib Ghosh.         
	With the higher education department releasing around Rs 49 lakh in September 2008 for air-conditioning, work is likely to begin by end-January, once the college functions are over. If there are no further hurdles, a new-look Derozio Hall should be ready by June-July, promised Sengupta.

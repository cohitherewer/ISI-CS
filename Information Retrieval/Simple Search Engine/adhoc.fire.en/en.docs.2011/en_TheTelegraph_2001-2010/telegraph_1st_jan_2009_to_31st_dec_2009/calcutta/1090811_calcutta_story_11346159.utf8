The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Meet focus on space for art 
                                                                                                               Meet focus on space for art 
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Eminent artists from the city met Union culture secretary Jawhar Sircar at an informal discussion at CIMA Gallery on Saturday and highlighted issues related to their community.         
	Sircar had Ganesh Pyne, Jogen Chowdhury, Ganesh Haloi, Rabin Mandal, Samir Aich, Bimal Kundu, Shyamal Roy and Isha Mohammad, among others, for company. Rakhi Sarkar of CIMA attended the meeting.         
	The younger artists, especially Aich, a joint secretary at the Academy of Fine Arts, were more vocal about their demands. The well-being of the academy was their first demand. Artists feel that the galleries are small compared to the demand for exhibition space and these should be brought up to the international standard. It is ironic that one of the oldest fine arts societies of India is now more important today as a venue for theatre. A museum at the academy has remained closed for years.        
	The museum is a treasure trove of art, from Tagore to Atul Bose, said Aich.         
	The artists wanted the Centre to see that work started on the second building of Lalit Kala Akademi, for which a 31-cottah plot in Moulali has been sanctioned. The first building at Keyatala in Gol Park is felt to be inadequate for an institution as large in scope as Lalit Kala.         
	The artists also complained about the lack of working space and the cost of materials for sculpture. Government awards, too, often bypass Calcutta artists. Why dont we have an NGMA in Calcutta? asked one. Sircar conceded that Calcutta needed an art set-up.         
	He asked for a proposal to be submitted on the general improvement of the Academy of Fine Arts. An encouraging Sircar added that funds could be allocated for its museum under a scheme that offers up to Rs 2.5 crore to a museum for renovation or repair. Rakhi Sarkar suggested that given the preponderance of fake art, a national level art authentication mechanism be set up. The culture secretary said the system could be in place through Lalit Kala.         
	Sircar ended with a piece of good news: an exhibition of Company paintings is arriving in Calcutta. The dates are yet to be decided. Sircar is in touch with the director of Victoria and Albert Museum in London, Mark Jones, who sent two experts to check out the facilities at NGMA and Victoria Memorial.

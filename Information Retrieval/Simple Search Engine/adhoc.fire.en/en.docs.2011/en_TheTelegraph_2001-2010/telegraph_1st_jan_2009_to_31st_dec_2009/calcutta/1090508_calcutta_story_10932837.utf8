The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cops lax in felling zone
                                                                                                               Cops lax in felling zone
          JAYANTA BASU                              
	Piya Chatterjee, who lives behind Jogesh Chandra College, recently found that a neighbour had cut three large trees she had planted in front of her house at least five years ago. Responding to her complaint, officers from Charu Market police station visited the spot, found proof of violation and advised her to settle the matter amicably.        
	This is the rule rather than an exception in an area that has become a hotbed of tree felling. Complaints by the state forest department, which alone has the authority to allow tree felling in the city, and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) to the police have been as ineffective as FIRs by residents.        
	Since August 2008, we have lodged five FIRs with Lake police station in connection with the felling of 20 full-grown trees on Prince Anwar Shah Road but the cops hardly followed up the complaints, said Majedar Rahman, the divisional forest officer in the forest department.        
	Sometime back, I received a complaint that 11 trees had been illegally cut on Anwar Shah Road and visited the area before contacting the police commissioner. Upon his directive, officers from the local police station visited the spot but to no avail, said mayoral council member (parks) Faiyaz Ahmed Khan.        
	According to Rahman, the trees are being cut to allow unobstructed view of billboards and shop fronts, and to clear the frontage of large housing estates. In Chatterjees case, the trees which had grown to a height of three to four storeys were cut because her neighbour feared a Norwester might fell them.        
	The officer-in-charge of Charu Market police station said as far he could remember the trees were damaged in a Norwester. However, I have to look into the details, he added.        
	The officer-in-charge of Lake police station said he was not aware that several FIRs by the forest department had not been acted upon and claimed three persons were once arrested for tree felling.        
	Under the non-forest area tree cutting act, those who cut trees without permission can be jailed as well as fined  Rs 5,000 for individuals and Rs 10,000 for promoters. Violators are encouraged by the fact that even if they are caught they will only be fined, said green activist Subhash Dutta.

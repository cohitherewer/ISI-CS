The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tree wall as cyclone bar
                                                                                                               Tree wall as cyclone bar

	The devastation by the cyclonic storm Aila has triggered the state forest department to modify plantation patterns in the city.         
	The tree planting planning in the city should be done with regard to the changing climate as more such devastating storms are expected in future, said Somenath Mukherjee, a forest department official in charge of urban forestry.         
	Mostly taller trees with bigger canopies like krishnachura and radhachura were uprooted as they might have lost their stability with root systems not growing normally within concrete footpaths. Hence we are thinking about planting smaller trees with heights less than 20 feet like neem, chhatim, putranjiba, bakul, debdaru and trees of the ficus variety, he said.         
	The department has decided to plant trees at least 10 feet from each other. At least 4sq ft ground will be provided to each plant to allow it to grow normally. We will also try to plant kamini, karabi or kolke in between the trees. The plan is only for Calcutta roads and the pattern of planting will remain unchanged for the Maidan or the gardens, he added.         
	Pruning is another important issue. Often a tree is pruned only on the side of the road, making it unstable, said Aniruddha Mukherjee, the head of the department of environment sciences at Calcutta University.         
	He said proper tree plantation can have a significant cooling effect, leading to less use of air-conditioners, which in turn will counter climate change. If you consider the ecological services that the trees provide, the average value of a tree should be between Rs 50,000 and Rs 5 lakh, he added.         
	According to the climate models, sea surface temperature increases because of global warming and triggers an increase in cyclone frequency and intensity. Calcutta is hardly 180km from the coastline and cyclones, a Unicef study on Calcutta had warned about two years back.         
	Experts have pointed out that Calcutta was lucky in the last decade as two major cyclones in excess of 200kmph speed  one in 1999 and Sidr in 2007  had bypassed the city at the last moment. Calcutta would have been devastated by either one of them with such poor preparedness, but we cannot be lucky every time, said Jude Henriques, a senior disaster management adviser at international agency Caritas, Asia, and formerly with Unicef.

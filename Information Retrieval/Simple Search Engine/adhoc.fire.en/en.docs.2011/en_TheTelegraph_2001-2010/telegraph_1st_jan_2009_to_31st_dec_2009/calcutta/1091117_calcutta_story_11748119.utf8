The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rain respite in heat run
                                                                            Tuesday , November 17 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Rain respite in heat run
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A burst of November rain and a favourable forecast for the days ahead soothed Calcutta after a sweltering fortnight that has been officially declared the warmest prelude to winter in five decades.        
	I have just gone through Met records and discovered that the first half of November was the hottest in five decades. The good news is that things will get better from now on, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre.        
	Mondays rain  it was heavy in parts of the city but not more than a drizzle in some areas  dragged down the Celsius by a couple of degrees after the days minimum temperature had touched a high of six degrees above normal. The Celsius could dip by up to three degrees on Tuesday with more rain being forecast.         
	We had anticipated scattered rain at the start of the week, which is expected to continue over the next couple of days. So, the mercury will climb down, Debnath said.        
	Whats causing the pre-winter rain? A low-pressure trough over south Bengal that overpowered the high-pressure belt over the Bay responsible for the swelter, the weatherman explained.        
	The trend of above-normal November temperatures had begun midway through the first week of the month. Temperatures had stayed four degrees above normal from November 5 to 13 before shooting up by another two to four degrees over the weekend. Sundays minimum temperature was eight notches above normal at 26.7 degrees Celsius.        
	Between April and November, the city experienced four record warm phases. It has been a watershed year in terms of Calcutta weather, said an official of the India Meteorological Department.        
	Now that these hot spells are behind us, how far are we from winter? What can be meteorologically defined as winter is still 10-14 days away. But the so-called wintry feeling should set in after five to seven days, said an official from the Noida-based National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Eateries divided on elderly discount 
                                                                                                               Eateries divided on elderly discount 
          SUBHRO SAHA                          A group of senior citizens at a city restaurant                                  
	The red carpet may not be rolled out to the grandpas and grandmas at all dine dens in town. At least, not yet.        
	Opinion in Calcuttas restaurant trade is divided on extending special privileges to senior citizens that would encourage them to come out more and dine alongside the citys GeNext.        
	Deepak Sharma, the secretary-general of Federation of Hotels amp; Restaurants Associations of India, had announced in Delhi recently that customers accompanied by senior citizens would be entitled to discounts, raising hopes among the citys elderly.        
	Its a good thought but we are not sure if such privileges can be extended by all our member restaurateurs anytime soon because of logistical reasons, S.K. Khullar, the president of Hotels amp; Restaurants Association of Eastern India, tells Metro.        
	Nitin Kothari, who owns Peter Cat and Mocambo, and is an executive committee member of the national apex body, is more direct, terming Sharmas statement as unilateral and premature. Kothari stresses that the senior citizens discount scheme does not have the backing of the federation and the newspaper report came as a bolt from the blue to local restaurants.        
	Sunny Puri of Trincas agrees with Kothari that the modalities of such a privilege programme must be worked out in great detail before it can be announced. How will we find out the age of a senior citizen, for instance, and prevent misuse of the scheme? Puri asks.        
	Rakhi Purnima Dasgupta of Kewpies has the same concern. How do I know who is old enough to be a senior citizen? Also the discount percentage has to be figured out. For a restaurant like mine with only 55 covers, a 15 to 20 per cent discount is a little high, she says.        
	Sharmas scheme has takers too. Khullar himself is planning to introduce significant discounts and special treatment to his elderly customers in November, when his restaurant Amber will start its golden jubilee celebrations.        
	Anjan Chatterjees Speciality Restaurants Pvt Ltd, owners of the popular Mainland China brand, has been running a Senior Citizens Week every year. We offer a flat 25 per cent discount to all our elderly diners, plus a complimentary dish and a glass of wine, says Chatterjee.        
	The groups HR heads have taken special care to train their staff to be nice and helpful to senior citizens, keeping shawls and even sorbitrate handy. The restaurants are also being made wheelchair-friendly.        
	Sanjay Mukherjee, the general manager of PDK Shenaz Hotels Pvt Ltd which runs Ivory and Shisha, also feels its a good idea. It will make senior citizens feel more wanted. At Ivory Kitchen, we have been running a discount scheme for the elderly at regular intervals, he points out.        
	The ranks of Mainland China and Ivory may not swell soon, given the lack of clarity in the rebate for elderly overture. The executive panel of the national apex body hasnt even discussed the issue in detail and before we can make it binding on our member restaurateurs, all the pieces of the puzzle must be in place, says Kothari.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CM praise for state doctors
                                                                                                               CM praise for state doctors
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Wednesday heaped praise on the state health department, which has come to be regarded even within the government as one of the worst performers.        
	Bhattacharjee sought to prove his point by highlighting the commitment shown by state health service doctors in the Sunderbans, affected by Aila, and Lalgarh, racked by the fight against Maoists.        
	At Hingalganj (in the Sunderbans), there was supposed to be one doctor but I found as many as six doctors attending to the victims. Same in Lalgarh. There are three doctors though there is supposed to be only one, the chief minister said after inaugurating the silver jubilee celebrations of the Association of Health Services Doctors at NRS Medical College and Hospital.        
	The ground reality, however, is a little different. In Binpur 1 block, under which Lalgarh falls, there are three primary health centres for 1,50,000 people. Each health centre should have three doctors but has been functioning with only one. One more doctor joined the Lalgarh centre on Sunday.        
	In the Aila-affected Gosaba block of the Sunderbans, the only primary health centre is at Gosaba. People from remote islands such as Kumirmari, Satjelia and Choto Mollakhali travel for hours to reach Gosaba.        
	The chief minister said the the states basic health indicators proved that the department, under minister Surjya Kanta Mishra, had been working hard. But the squalid wards of the Infectious Diseases Hospital or of any other state-run hospital present a different picture.

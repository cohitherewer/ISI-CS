          A STAFF REPORTER                                                                                                
	The institute was forced to lower its salary bar by more than Rs 2 lakh this year, dropping from Rs 8.2 lakh last year to Rs 6 lakh, to accommodate more companies.        
	A total of 86 companies, out of the 170 targeted, participated in the 10-day placement process as compared to 107 companies over four days last year.        
	We did not want to close the placements till each and every student got placed, which was the primary aim, said Prafulla Agnihotri, the chairperson of career development and placement at IIM Calcutta.

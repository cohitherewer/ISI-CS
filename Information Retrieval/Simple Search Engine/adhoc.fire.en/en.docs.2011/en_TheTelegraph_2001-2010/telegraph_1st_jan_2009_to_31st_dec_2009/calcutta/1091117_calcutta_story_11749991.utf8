                The youth who jumped in front of a Metro Railway train at Sovabazar-Sutanuti station on Sunday afternoon has been identified as Apu Basak, 18, a first-year student of Raja Manindra College, police said on Monday. An officer said Apu, a resident of Masjidbari Street near Jorabagan, had been ridiculed by his mother on Sunday morning for his haircut. Apus neighbours and friends had made fun of him for his closely cropped hair. The police said Apu probably killed himself unable to bear the humiliation.     Two persons died in separate accidents in the city early on Monday. A 48-year-old engineer, Prasanta Das, died after being hit on VIP Road by a bus on the Siliguri-Calcutta route around 4am. Cops said Prasanta and his mother were returning from Nagpur and had got off a taxi to reach their Baguiati home when the bus hit them. Prasanta was taken to RG Kar hospital, where he was declared dead. His mother was taken to Apollo Hospitals with injuries.   t 10am, Ratan Das, 22, died after an airport-bound truck hit him at the Madhyamgram crossing. Das, a local resident, died on the way to hospital. The driver fled leaving behind the truck.     An unidentified motorcyclist in his 30s was critically injured after a minibus on the Dharamtala-Bhattanagar route hit him on Jheel Road in Liluah at 5.45pm on Monday. Local residents blocked a road in the locality to protest rash driving. The minibuses on the Dharamtala-Bhattanagar route stopped operations for the day.     Priyabrata Das, 27, who worked as an accountant in a clinic in the Kalighat area, was arrested on Monday on the charge of duping his employer of Rs 5 lakh by forging his signature. Police said Das had access to his employer Saumitra Debs chequebook. Deb lodged a police complaint on March 19 after he realised Rs 5 lakh was missing from his account. Das was absconding for over seven months and was picked up from his Jorabagan home on Monday.    Apropos the report Fair guide to US and UK education on Monday, a quote by Marina Gandhi, the head (education) of British Council East India, on A Festival of Bright Ideas should have read: Students aiming to go to the UK typically start the process of application during this time. So this annual event helps create awareness among them. The error is regretted.

                      Golden celebration of good times                    A popular city landmark associated not only with speciality cuisine, but also with music, Trincas had, by the early 1960s, gained a reputation that catapulted it to one of the top night-spots in the country. With Calcutta in its heydays and the Swinging Sixties well and truly under way, famous names and faces from the corporate and entertainment worlds were regular features at this iconic establishment. Trincas has also been the place where a number of reputed musicians started their careers. While evolving with the times, it has continued to maintain its original charm as a live music venue. Featuring four special evenings of music, the 50th anniversary celebrations of Trincas gets under way today with a performance by Shiva with Priyanka and Rianne. Tomorrow: Plan B with Rila. While July 4ths show will again feature Shiva with Priyanka and Rianne, the last day features Usha Uthup, who began her career as a singer in Trincas, with a show that will also mark the 40th anniversary of her own music career.

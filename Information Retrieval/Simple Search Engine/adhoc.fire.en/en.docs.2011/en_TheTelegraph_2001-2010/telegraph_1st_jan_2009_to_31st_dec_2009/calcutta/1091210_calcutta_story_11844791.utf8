                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Pool car strike in Howrah
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Most pool car owners in Howrah started a wildcat strike on Wednesday, inconveniencing thousands of students and parents.         
	The strike  to protest harassment by the Howrah motor vehicles department  would continue on Thursday.        
	The 700-odd pool car owners taking part in the protest are not part of any association. They said they had called each other up and decided not to ferry students.        
	Till late on Wednesday, they were engaged in discussions to form an association.        
	Most guardians said they had not been informed about the strike. They waited with their wards on the road before taking buses and autorickshaws.        
	Many working parents had to skip office and cancel appointments to take their children to school.         
	Souvik Ghosh, a doctor living in Jaynarayan Babu Ananda Dutta Lane, said: I took my son Soumyadip, a Class IV student, to school keeping my patients waiting. We found it difficult to board a bus from Mandirtala, as all of them were packed.         
	Trader Barun Ghosh said he had to keep his shop closed for an hour to take his son Abhishek, a Class VI student, to school.        
	Debasish Kuthe, a pool car owner, stated: We have decided to withdraw services for 48 hours to protest harassment by the motor vehicles department. Motor vehicles officials create trouble saying that we do not have proper permits but refuse to issue such permits to us.

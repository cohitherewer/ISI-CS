                      Divine power in art                    The Ojo de Dios (Gods Eye) is a ritual tool, magical object and cultural symbol evoking the weaving motif and its spiritual associations. For the Huichol natives of north-western Mexico, it is symbolic of the power of seeing and understanding the mysterious and the unknown. It is made up of four points representing the elemental processes of earth, fire, air and water. Christianity envisions Gods Eye as a power where the binding of the Gods Eye is the physical process of a spiritual binding or covenant. This concept is based on the idea that Gods Eye will watch the binder (or the person for whom the Gods Eye is wrought) and grant health, fortune, longevity and happiness. The ongoing exhibition of paintings by Niladri Sekhar Majumder, has been inspired by the Eye of God concept from designs in native, as well as Islamic and Christian cultures. They are usually objects or jewellery with eye designs that is used to ward off the evil eye. Having their origin in the philosophy that God is omnipresent in the universe, the paintings are full of vibrant colours such as crimson red, vermillion, golden yellow and black.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | All the worlds a pitch
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      All the worlds a pitch
										      SAJNI MUKHERJI      Autumn Flush                        Pankaj Roy and Vinoo Mankad (right) after a record partnership against New Zealand in 1989			                           
	Last Sundays opening page in The Telegraph had a petulant statement to the media from home minister Chidambaram that the David Headley affair was not a cricket match to which he was giving a ball-by-ball commentary. The vocabulary of crickets armchair golden oldies is dominated by cricket at all times but especially so in the season. (Do I hear a wife saying: when is it not the season? Is it my imagination or is there cricket on the TV 24x7?)         
	An elegant, pithy remark becomes a sizzling straight drive. The way to deal with an argumentative spouse is to keep playing a quiet forward defensive to every ball bowled by her, abjuring even singles along the way. You wait until it is time and then you hit a sixer.         
	Every non-cricketing situation yields a man of the match. Some friends have constituted themselves into a fielding side that catches memorable quotes from the kind of person who offers them. Periodically I hear one of them has been removed from the slips because he has failed in his duty.         
	My golden oldies have never played cricket since school or college, longer ago than most of them care to remember. When a wife or some other mere female heckles them for continuing to watch a game India has clearly lost, they will fix her with a steely glare and sternly inform her they have been following cricket from the time when India NEVER won. One prayed for a draw and took ones joys from Manjrekar (Vijay) having scored 50, from the four boundaries in Umrigars cameo of 35, from Pankaj Roys great courage going back to rising deliveries with his bat held up high against his chest, from Subhas Gupte who would have taken more wickets than Shane Warne if Indian fielding had been better in those days and from that elusive entity known to the true aficionado as the finer points of the game.         
	Grown-up men confess to shedding tears as they heard of Mankad (Vinoo) completing his century at Lords. Only someone truly crass would think of merely winning or losing at a time like this. The men in our lives appropriated unconditional custody of the radio in the old days as they do now with the TV remote until the last nail stuck/sticks in the coffin.         
	With tender passion they favour five-day tests, but they watch ODIs and T20s (cheerleaders and all) with equal unrelenting concentration, unforgiving if one dares breathe in the sacred space between them and the TV. So here is a quiz for the golden oldies, especially their dauntless women:         
	1. A family game. Name at least three father-and-son pairs, two pairs of brothers-in-law, one pair of uncle and nephew, three captains who were also first cousins, and the single amazing grandfather and grandsons combination.         
	2. Which West Indian commentator has easily spanned radio and TV commentary and is still going strong?         
	3. Which cosmetic company advertised its wares by handing you a sunshade and a sample tube as you walked into your enclosure at the Eden ?         
	4. Which radio commentator started the day with Good morning to you all and Jai Bharat? He also talked endlessly about pan at the mike, the chewing kind. We have (Umpire) Pan on the field and Surti (batting). All we need is someone called Supari.         
	5. Which TV commentator and former player reeled off choice abuses before he (and we) became aware the mike had mistakenly (deliberately?) been left on during the tea break? (Early days of Doordarshan coverage.)         
	No prizes for the correct answers.                     The writer, a former professor of English at Jadavpur University,

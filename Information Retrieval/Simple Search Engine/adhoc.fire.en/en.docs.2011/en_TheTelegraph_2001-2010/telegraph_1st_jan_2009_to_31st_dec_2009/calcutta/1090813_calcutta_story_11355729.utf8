The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Triple blow to traffic
                                                                                                               Triple blow to traffic
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The view from the drivers cabin of a bus blocked by the Trinamul rally on Bidhan Sarani. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                  
	Thousands of supporters of the Congress, Trinamul Congress and the BJP descended on central Calcutta on Wednesday afternoon choking traffic flow for hours.        
	The disruptions started around 1pm when a group of Trinamul supporters assembled near Esplanade ahead of a rally by the partys youth wing, protesting the imposition of Section 144 on Mangalkot.        
	A Youth Congress rally on the PTTI issue reached Esplanade around the same time. Traffic on SN Banerjee Road, Chittaranjan Avenue and other important arteries leading to the crossing had to be diverted.        
	The Trinamul Youth Congress rally had meanwhile held up traffic on Bidhan Sarani, College Street and SN Banerjee Road on its way to Rani Rashmoni Avenue from College Square.        
	Before the situation could normalise, a BJP programme against price rise started on a flank of the Metro channel at 3pm. Those returning from office were stuck in the resultant snarls till 6.30pm, long after the meeting ended.         
	Those headed for Medical College and Hospital in the afternoon were among the worst sufferers.        
	I have been looking for a taxi for half an hour to take my mother, who has just been discharged from Medical College and Hospital after an eye surgery, home. But nothing is moving, said Arghya Basu around 2.30pm.        
	Banani Halder, a 60-year-old resident of Beadon Street who was stuck in a snarl on Bidhan Sarani for nearly an hour, worried about missing her appointment with a doctor.

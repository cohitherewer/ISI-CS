          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The body of a woman in her 30s, chopped into three pieces, was found in two sacks and a bag abandoned on a vestibule of the Azad Hind Express at Howrah station on Tuesday morning.        
	The identity of the woman could not be established. On November 22, a 28-year-old man was found hanging from the ceiling fan of the train, which runs between Pune and Howrah.         
	Preliminary investigation indicated that the woman was strangled to death and then her body was cut to pieces. Apart from body parts, one of the sacks contained a pair of chappals, a pair of womens leather shoes, a pair of womens gloves and a cardigan. Police said the train reached platform No. 17, in the new complex of Howrah station, around 4.45am. GRP and RPF personnel found the sacks and bag on the vestibule between S5 and S6 compartments during a routine check.         
	As the bag and the sacks were unclaimed, GRP officers opened them and found the body parts.         
	Accident: An autorickshaw heading towards Shyampur was hit by a bus on the Bagnan-Shyampur Road on Tuesday evening. Police said five of the six passengers travelling in the auto had to be hospitalised.

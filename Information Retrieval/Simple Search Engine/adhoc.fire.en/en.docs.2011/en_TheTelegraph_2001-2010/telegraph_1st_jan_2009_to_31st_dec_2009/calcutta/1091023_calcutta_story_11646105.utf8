                                                                                                               Teachers dues for husband
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                               
	The high court on Thursday asked the primary school education department to pay the dues of a teacher who had died of cancer to her husband within four weeks.        
	Sunil Kumar Das, a Baguiati resident, had moved the court, alleging that the district school authorities had claimed he did not have the right to demand the arrears and retirement benefits due to his late wife Sandhya.        
	Justice Soumitra Pal, in his verdict, observed that husbands had the right to claim the arrears due to their late wives. But they do not have the right to demand family pension. Only dependants can claim family pension, the order said.        
	The judge asked the director (pension and provident fund) of the primary school education department to clear Sandhyas dues within four weeks. The court also directed the official, the North 24-Parganas district primary school council secretary and the headmistress of the school where Sandhya last taught to sort out problems related to disbursement of dues.        
	Sandhya had served in primary schools from 1963 to 2007. The district primary school council did not grant her increments from 1986. As a result, she did not benefit from the revisions in pay scales in 1990 and 1998, said Dass lawyer.

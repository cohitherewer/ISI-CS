The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Dhaba goes to the mall
                                                                                                               Dhaba goes to the mall
        ZEESHAN JAWED                          The Balwant Singh dhaba on New Years eve                                        
	Balwant Singh da Dhaba is bridging the gap between Bhowanipore and the Bypass. Come April, the 79-year-old dhaba at 10/B Harish Mukherjee Road will open a 100-seater restaurant at Mani Square.         
	The Five Rivers (English translation of the word Punjab), on the fourth floor of the Bypass mall, will offer guests a taste of undivided Punjab and Kashmir. The cooks, being sourced from north India, will be guided by chef and food critic Jigs Kalra. Unlike the dhaba, The Five Rivers will cater to non-vegetarians.        
	The newly formed Dhanoa Food and Hospitality Pvt Ltd, which is launching the restaurant, plans to start more such eateries across the country.        
	There is a big difference in the way a dhaba and a restaurant is run. The company was formed to inject professionalism and corporate culture in the running of eateries, says 27-year-old Kiranjeet Kaur, one of the brains behind Dhanoa Food and Hospitality.        
	Her great grandfather had started the dhaba hoping to attract those who came to pray in the nearby gurdwara. Last Christmas and New Years eve, it was the most sought after dining destination for party-hoppers. Hundreds had made a beeline for the dhaba in their cars and SUVs.        
	Kiranjeets brother Manish, who is also involved in the new venture, feels the goodwill that Balwant Singh da Dhaba has earned is probably not enjoyed by some of the bigger names in the hospitality business.        
	The young entrepreneurs are not daunted by the downturn either. Eating out has taken a beating in recent months but we are confident as we would offer quality food at low prices and that too in a mall, adds Manish.        
	The Five Rivers is not the first humble eatery to attempt a transition to the swanky environs of a mall. Gautams, a tiny coffee shop on the Bypass that became a favourite long-drive stopover, last year opened a 100sq ft outlet in Mani Square, which has become popular.

                                                                                                               Citu scare at City Centre

	A turf war between the CPM and the Citu over the spoils of billboard advertising in Salt Lakes most happening area sent the Sunday afternoon crowd at City Centre scurrying for cover.        
	A couple of shops downed shutters and guards escorted people to the safety of the malls upper tiers as a group of Citu supporters laid siege to the ring road leading to the parking lot and pulled down hoardings. Police caned the troublemakers and restored normality after around half an hour.        
	It was scary till the police took control. The evening footfall wasnt affected, though, an official of City Centre said.         
	Seven persons were arrested for arson, sub-divisional police officer Subhankar Bhattacharya said.         
	The labour unions show of strength came hours after its Salt Lake office was gutted in a fire that was allegedly sparked by CPM cadres. The 1,600-sq-ft structure, less than 100m from the mall, housed the offices of the Citu-affiliated taxi, autorickshaw and rickshaw unions.        
	Pramod Jha, the general secretary of the Citu taxi union, blamed the CPMs local leaders for the trouble. Some CPM supporters attacked our office and set it ablaze because auto drivers had stopped them from putting up hoardings near our office. We have lodged a complaint with the police.        
	Leaders of the CPMs Salt Lake unit accused the Citu of trying to extort money from advertising agencies. When some of my men went to put up a billboard near City Centre early on Sunday, some Citu supporters demanded money. They assaulted my workers because they did not pay up, Niloy Ghosh, a local committee member who owns a billboard advertising firm, said.         
	Jha did not name the CPM in the complaint but told reporters that the people who attacked the Citu office were all from the party. Around 50 men, armed with sticks and firearms, came to the office after midnight and started beating up the 15-odd union members who were there. They smashed all the furniture, including a computer, before setting the office ablaze.        
	State Citu secretary Kali Ghosh said he was unaware of any dispute between the union and the CPM over billboard advertising but sources confirmed that trouble had been brewing over the past few months.         
	Local leaders of the CPM and the Citu have been fighting for some time over a share of the billboard advertising pie, the owner of an advertising agency said.         
	Bidhannagar Municipality charges between Rs 80,000 and Rs 90,000 annually for a hoarding near City Centre. Local groups collect some money separately, the agency owner said. Sundays fracas added to the embarrassment of the CPMs defeat at the hands of the Trinamul in the Bishnupur West bypoll. This is an internal matter and we will settle it among ourselves, said MP Amitava Nandy, the party leader in charge of Salt Lake.

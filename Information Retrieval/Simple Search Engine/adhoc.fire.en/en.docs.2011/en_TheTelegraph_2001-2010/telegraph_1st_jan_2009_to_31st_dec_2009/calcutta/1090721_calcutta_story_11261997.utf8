                                                                                                               Balloon-borne study
          PRASUN CHAUDHURI                          One of the balloons that will glide at an altitude of 35km with equipment to capture images of the eclipse on July 22                                  
	A city based research institute is planning to use balloons to study the total solar eclipse on July 22.         
	Scientists at the Indian Centre for Space Physics (ICSP)  a non-governmental research institute  want to capture the images of the eclipse through highly sensitive telescopes mounted on balloons at Raigunj in north Bengal.        
	Our balloon experiment is aimed at exploring the moons diffraction effects of the sunlight during the solar eclipse from the upper reaches of the atmosphere, said Sandip Chakrabarti, in-charge of the ICSP and a senior professor at the SN Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences.        
	The ultimate goal is to gain a three-dimensional view of the eclipsing sun from a unique vantage point nearly 35km in space, he added.         
	The ICSP plans to launch five balloonsats on three giant balloons, capable of capturing crystal clear video images of the sun.        
	Balloonsats are minuscule satellites that contain video cameras, X-ray measuring instruments and small telescopes that land on earth after the job is done, said D. Bhoumik, in-charge of the electronics division of the ICSP.         
	Well track the balloonsats with the help of global positioning system (GPS). The data will be received at our end via a technology called telemetry, he explained.         
	The technology was developed at the ICSP and tested by measuring X-rays in space, said B. Bhattacharya, the president of institute.         
	According to Chakrabarti, the balloon-borne equipment will help them defy the possible cloud cover in the monsoon sky.         
	The first balloon will be launched at 5.30am on July 22 and two others will follow within half an hour. A total solar eclipse provides a unique opportunity to carry out numerous experiments that cannot be conducted otherwise, said Chakrabarti.

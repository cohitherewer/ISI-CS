The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Flights missing on screen
                                                                                                               Flights missing on screen

	Flights are still disappearing randomly from the secondary radar screen at the city airport, though the air traffic control had lodged a complaint weeks ago about the lapse that could lead to mid-air mishaps any time.        
	Officials have blamed a snag in the secondary radar in Berhampore, Orissa, for the vanishing act. The radar covers a radius of around 200 nautical miles and gives the speed and altitude of aircraft.        
	Metro had on May 4 reported that at least five flights had gone missing from the radar screen though regional executive director P.K. Singhal denied the problem, saying the radar system was working fine.        
	But around 2am the next day, a Qantas Airways flight from London to Singapore suddenly disappeared from the radar screen after crossing Bhubaneswar.        
	The aircraft was on the screen after it entered the Calcutta region from Khajuraho. But it could not be traced after it crossed Bhubaneswar. The pilots position had to be recorded through voice communication, said an official.        
	Within 10 minutes, the ATC faced a similar, but more alarming, problem. A Singapore Airlines flight from Singapore to London did not appear on the screen at all while it was flying through the Calcutta region.        
	We were unaware about its existence till the pilot spoke through the voice communication system. Had we assigned a flight the same altitude as the one from Singapore Airlines before we came to know about its existence, there could have been a collision, the official said.        
	In both cases, the official added, other aircraft were visible on the screen.        
	The secondary radar was installed in 2004 and commissioned two years later. Officials said the radar had never functioned satisfactorily, as its coverage area comprises several dark zones, such as hills, which prevent proper transmission of signals.        
	According to pilots, when the ATC maintains surveillance through radar the separation between the two aircraft is reduced.        
	In such a situation, if one aircraft is not appearing on the screen, safety is compromised, a senior pilot pointed out.        
	An official had earlier admitted that the ATC had lodged a complaint about the disappearance of aircraft and said the authorities were trying to fix the snag.

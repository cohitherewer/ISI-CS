The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Order, order, fall in love
                                                                                                               Order, order, fall in love
										      Free radical                                    
	Sometime last year, on a visit to Puri, I thought I had seen a beached whale. In the fading evening light, it lay inert and looked like a dark blob close to the edge of the water. But then, as a wave crashed in, the body came to life and, much to my horror, split into two separate halves. It was then that I realised that the creature was, in fact, not one but two portly human beings  a man and a woman, who lay with their bodies entwined as a dead whale.         
	The rushing water had disentangled them momentarily; the man floated away gently from the woman before being washed back to her by another wave. I could hear the womans laughter ringing above the sound of the crashing waves.        
	I never quite did find out who they were, but I like to imagine them as a couple who had come to Puri to save their marriage under the courts orders. That kind of longing, surrounded by sand and salt water, in the midst of bathers clad in colourful towels, sweetmeat-sellers and camel-drivers, could only have been brought about by years of painful separation.         
	The marriage law was amended in 1976, but the judiciary has taken upon itself the responsibility of bringing estranged couples together only recently. These days, the courts apparently throng with men and women solemnly pledging their irreconcilable differences, and also accusing each other of violence perpetrated with bontis and khuntis.         
	There is also evidence of other sordid conduct: locking up kitchens to deny food to spouses and soiling toilets. Marriage, that venerable cog in the wheel of social existence, is under threat, and as is the case in every other crisis in this country, the courts have come to the rescue, sending couples off to places away from their squabbling relatives to resolve their differences.         
	Some are sent to Puri. On one occasion, a man and a woman found themselves cooped up in Hotel Pushpa in Sealdah without a spare set of clothes or even their toothbrushes and mobile phones. Be it the sea, or inside unfashionable hotel rooms lacking essentials, men and women have laid down their kitchen knives and spatulas and apparently fallen in love with each other all over again.        
	But the courts, in their intention of liberating couples from oppressive, intrusive domestic arrangements, have fallen back on a model that is no less intrusive. The modus operandi of this supervision is illuminating.         
	The courts send couples on patch-up leave, and decide for them the quantum of time. During that period, which is often not more than a few days, they are expected to keep their respective lawyers informed about developments. The officer-in-charge of the police station under which the leave destination falls is also notified. Under such relentless supervision a few days are all they need to reassure themselves about the infallibility of companionship.        
	What is also fairly evident is that the judiciary, much like society in general, shares the anxiety to preserve the institution of marriage. This urgency to defend a time-honoured social contract, and the tendency to frown upon alternative ways of living, have not changed appreciably, despite occasional rulings that have sought to protect and grant equal rights to women living-in with their partners.         
	That marriage, or for that matter, divorce, is a matter of individual choice, and that adults need not be tutored by courts to choose either option, still look like unthinkable propositions.        
	And what about the elderly? They, we have been repeatedly told, are incapable of desire, even the desire to put an end to prolonged conjugal misery. Applications for divorce from those above 40 are a rarity, assured one public prosecutor. But that may only be because of prejudice and the absence of an adequate support structure.        
	But not everything is lost. Even though romance is being rekindled under the watchful eyes of the law, there abound some incorrigible souls.         
	One couple, directed to move to Puri by the court, got as far as the bus stand. Once there, the man and the woman started quarrelling, and he even refused to pay for her trip. In a world in search of perfect happiness, these two seemed content to be beautifully flawed.

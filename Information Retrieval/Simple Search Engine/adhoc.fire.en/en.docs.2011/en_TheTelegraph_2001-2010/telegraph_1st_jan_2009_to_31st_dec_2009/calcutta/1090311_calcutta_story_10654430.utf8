The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Poison hint in baby death
                                                                                                               Poison hint in baby death
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The two-year-old boy found in a bag on the bank of the Hooghly, near Sankrail police station, might have been poisoned before being thrown into the river, said the doctor who conducted the post-mortem.         
	The injuries on the babys body could not have caused his death. Only the viscera report can confirm whether the baby had been poisoned. Nail, hair, blood and contents of the babys stomach have been sent for forensic examination, said the surgeon.         
	An investigator also said the baby, yet to be identified, might have been given milk laced with poison.        
	A feeding bottle was found inside the bag which contained the body.        
	A three-member team of the Criminal Investigation Department, along with a photographer, visited the Howrah police morgue on Tuesday afternoon to inspect the body.        
	Only a couple from Tikiapara visited the police station and the morgue on Tuesday. But after seeing the body, they said the baby was not theirs, said an officer of Sankrail police station on Tuesday.         
	All police stations in the state have been informed about the baby, he added.        
	We are trying to gather clues from the babys clothes and shoes as well as the travel bag in which the body was stuffed and thrown into the river, said another officer.

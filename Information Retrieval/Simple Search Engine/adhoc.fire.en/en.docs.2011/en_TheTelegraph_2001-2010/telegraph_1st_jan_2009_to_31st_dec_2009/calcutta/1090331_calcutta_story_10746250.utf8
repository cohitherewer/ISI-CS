The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Factory closed after blaze
                                                                                                               Factory closed after blaze
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Firemen try to douse the blaze at the chemical factory near the airport on March 23. A Telegraph picture                                  
	The illegal chemical factory near the airport that had caught fire on March 23 has shut down permanently.        
	The owner wrote to inform us that the factory has been closed down and shifted from the site, Tapas Chatterjee, the chairman of Rajarhat-Gopalpur municipality, said on Monday.        
	We had lodged an FIR and asked the owner to shift the factory, he added.        
	The factory being within 100 metres of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport, aircraft parked in the hangar closest to it had to be moved as a precautionary measure during the fire.        
	The Airports Authority of India (AAI) later requested the municipal authorities to seal the factory since it was posing a safety risk.        
	It is good that the factory has been shut down but how could the municipal authorities allow the factory to operate without a licence? asked a senior official of the AAI.        
	We have requested the state government to identify and remove commercial units that can be safety hazards for the airport, he added.        
	Firefighters found it difficult to reach the factory and then put out the blaze. Firemen from the airport had to lend a hand in the operation. They sprayed foam on the factory from inside the airport compound.        
	According to AAI sources, there are a number of buildings around the airport that are safety hazards. These houses do not abide by fire safety rules, said an official.        
	While the AAI clears building plans around the airport in regard to height, the local municipalities are responsible for ensuring that the other norms are adhered to.        
	During meetings of the environment committee (which co-ordinates between the airport and the municipalities), we had asked the civic bodies to take action against buildings violating norms but nothing has been done, alleged an airport official.

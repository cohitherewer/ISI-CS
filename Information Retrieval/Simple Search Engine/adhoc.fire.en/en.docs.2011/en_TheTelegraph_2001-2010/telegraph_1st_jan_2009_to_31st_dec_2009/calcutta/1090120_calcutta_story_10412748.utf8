	State home secretary Ardhendu Sen met advocate-general Balai Ray on Monday to discuss the status report on the two-stroke autorickshaw ban that the government will place in the high court on January 27.         
	Lawyers on the state panel in the high court later said the advocate-general had asked the home secretary to provide him with all the documents on the progress in the drive against two-stroke autos.        
	The report has to be prepared by January 27. So I went to the advocate-generals chamber to meet him and discuss the issue, Sen said at Writers.        
	The home secretary also met senior officials of the transport department during the day to discuss the drive against autos.         
	According to sources at Writers, the government will pray for an extension of the April 1 deadline to phase out commercial vehicles that are more than 15 years old from the Calcutta Metropolitan Area.        
	We will pray for another three months to carry out the order, said a lawyer on the state panel.        
	The case relating to the ban on two-stroke autorickshaws will be taken up by the high court division bench headed by Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar on January 30.         
	On January 8 , the division bench had stated that it would decide whether to allow the state government time till July 31 to convert all two-stroke autos to LPG or not after going through the status report.        
	The 15-day deadline to file the report ends on January 23, a holiday. The matter will come up for hearing on January 30.

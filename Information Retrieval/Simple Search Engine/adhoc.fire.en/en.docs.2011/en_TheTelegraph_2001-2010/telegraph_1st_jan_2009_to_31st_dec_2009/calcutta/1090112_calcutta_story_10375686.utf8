	A patient went missing from SSKM Hospital on Saturday after being allegedly deserted by a Group D employee who was escorting him for a test.        
	Raghunath Rajak, 45, was suffering from hernia and was admitted to Curzon Ward. Doctors had prescribed bone and pus tests.         
	On Saturday morning, he was being taken to the hospitals orthopaedic department for an X-ray by his son Dipak. Ward attendant Bhim Chowdhury was accompanying them.        
	I had to deliver the pus sample to a private centre. Bhim said he would take my father back to his bed if I paid him Rs 50, said Dipak. But Rajak was nowhere to be found when Dipak returned.        
	When Bhim turned up for money, he denied any knowledge about the patient and fled on the pretext of looking for him. Police were informed about the incident on Sunday. Bhim admitted he had left the patient at the entrance to the main block, an officer said. A missing diary has been lodged by the hospital. Its difficult to man every patient, said Pradip Mitra, the director of the Institute of Postgraduate Medicine and Research, SSKM.

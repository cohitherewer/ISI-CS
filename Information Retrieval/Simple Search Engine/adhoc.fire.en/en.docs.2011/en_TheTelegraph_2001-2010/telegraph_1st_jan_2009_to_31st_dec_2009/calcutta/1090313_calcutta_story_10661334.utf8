The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hospital lost to land lock 
                                                                                                               Hospital lost to land lock 
  - Israeli unit wooed by three cities after 2-year wait in town          RITH BASU                                    
	Delhi, Bangalore and Jaipur have handed over to an Israeli healthcare company within a few months what Calcutta has not been able to for two years.        
	With the Bengal government sitting on a requisition for land from Elbit Medical Imaging (EMI), the proposed 1,000-bed multi-speciality hospital looks set to be the latest venture to bid bye to Bengal.        
	Though the company is yet to make its exit from Calcutta official, recent developments  from the groups shifting of focus to other cities to its severance of ties with local partner Ambuja Realty Group  suggest that the pullout is just a matter of time.        
	Our research told us that Calcutta had both the need and demand for the sort of state-of-the-art hospital we had in mind. We had set ourselves a deadline to complete 500 beds by 2010. But sadly, we did not get the required land here, something other cities did not lose much time in providing us with, said Tomer Gelbert, the vice president (development and marketing) of Elbit India Healthcare.         
	A 25-acre plot of land was identified in Chakgaria, off the EM Bypass, for the project in early 2007 but the acquisition could not be completed till February 2009 because of litigation on land title rights.        
	As the issue of land acquisition in Bengal became a political hot potato following Nandigram and Singur, the government chose not to intervene and Ambuja Realty Group  which was supposed to acquire land for the Neotia Elbit Healthciti  pulled out of the project last September.         
	It usually takes time here in India but things moved fast in all other cities. At this moment, we are ready to begin construction in all three cities, said Gelbart.        
	Delhi is getting a 500-bed hospital, Bangalore 400 beds and Jaipur a 350-bed unit. The company has plans to build 20 multi-speciality hospitals across India with an average investment of Rs 400 crore in each project.        
	An investment of Rs 1,000 crore (for 500 beds in the first phase) had been earmarked for the Calcutta hospital with modern facilities like non-invasive treatment of tumours and biotech research centre offering stem cell therapy.         
	The 15-acre plot would also have serviced apartments for the patients families, a medical mall, an alternative medical centre and a nursing training institute.        
	Harsh Neotia, the managing director of Ambuja Realty Group, said litigation on some portions of the identified land had resulted in inordinate delays in acquisition.        
	Then, Elbit started getting offers from other states.

										      flashback                        Prasad on Prasanna Coomar Tagore Street in 1962				                           
	I do not know who paints the picture of life on memorys canvas. But whatever the identity of the one who paints, he paints pictures. In other words, he does not take up the paintbrush to produce an exact likeness of what is happening. He retains or deletes so many things in accordance with his whims and fancies. These lines are from the opening paragraph of Rabindranath Tagores Jiban Smriti.        
	Sreejit Tagore should vouch for the pickiness of memory. In keeping with family tradition, he was adopted by Prabirendra Mohan Tagore in 1965 when he was five. Sreejit was Prabirendras nephews son, and at the time of his adoption he used to live with his parents in Kankulia Road. When he came to live in the palace Prasad in Pathuriaghat, he was floored.         
	To say that Prasad was awesome would be an understatement. There were three of us  my parents and I  but we had a retinue of 100 employees. At that time, the house was not rented out, says Sreejit, who has turned 50 and works for a UK company.        
	There were more than 200 rooms  for clothes, stationery, a room in which signboards were painted for provisions in the larder, and another for trunks and luggage and suitcases. There was also a dheki ghar (room of the husking peddle) and a kennel. Bibhuti Pal, who painted the signs, also modelled the clay images.         
	In 1965-67, Prasanna Coomar Tagore Street used to be lined with trees and whenever somebody drove down we used to go to check whose car it was, says Sreejit.         
	The child Sreejit absorbed everything, and as he grew up, observed the gradual decline of the splendour of Prasad, till at one point of time, the palace almost turned into a colossal ruin, when water seeped through the roof and the windows had no panes. The wall paper had started peeling. When I started living here, the durbar hall was still luxuriously appointed and portraits hung from the walls, he says, sitting in what was once the dining room. The wainscoting in this room, some of the heavy wooden furniture, the many-branched Osler lamp made of bronze hanging from the ceiling and grandfather clock are from the past, but the air-conditioner, music system, including turntable, and floors are all new. Tagore himself says that once when there was talk of selling off this huge property and shifting to their house in Varanasi, the Italian marble was removed from the floors of this house and transported to their home in UP. The Varanasi house on 235 bighas is a township, and it belongs to the Tagores only in name.         
	Everything was on a gargantuan scale. The treasury was a suite of two rooms with two huge doors at the entrance. The first was barred and the second was a sheet of solid steel made by Chubbs, lock and safe makers of UK. Silver dishes of various sizes, designs and shapes were kept there. He was never sure if the family jewellery was also kept there. Next to the treasury was the armoury where 300 to 400 firearms were kept. Once a month, Manton amp; Company came from Dalhousie Square to clean the weaponry. During the Naxalite movement, six to seven truckloads of arms were sent to Lalbazar.        
	Prabirendra Mohan Tagore was Justice of the Peace, and thereby was exempted from taking out an arms licence. Whenever they went for dinner to Government House, the driver would wear his special police badge given specifically to some Calcutta families to allow unhindered movement of their cars.        
	Sreejit admits he was not fortunate enough to see a fleet of cars but there was a Jaguar, Rover, Aston Martin, Wolsley, Sunbeam Talbot, and his mother, Surity Tagore, drove a Standard Herald.        
	But even more interesting was the larder where provisions were stored. Although only Sreejit and his parents lived in Prasad, there were 100 employees to serve them and look after the establishment. There were cleaners, drivers, maids and masseurs. Provisions like rice, flour, mustard oil and ghee were stored in giant barrels to feed them. The storekeeper would measure out provisions for that day and make entries in a huge accounts book with a red cover in the presence of his mother.        
	Then Sreejit went away to his school in Hazaribagh in 1965-1969, and when he would return during vacations he noticed the decline. In 1970, he noticed that everything was locked up and there was only one darwan. In 1972, a part of the mansion was rented out. There were structural changes in the building and changes in the demography as well. The house had seven courtyards. A school has come up around one of them.       SOUMITRA DAS

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hottest May day in seven summers
                                                                                                               Hottest May day in seven summers

	Calcutta suffered its hottest May day since 2002 on Friday, with the mercury soaring to 41.8 degrees Celsius, six degrees above normal, and the Met office issuing a heat wave warning for Saturday.        
	Friday was also the hottest day so far this summer, breaking the April 19 record of the highest maximum temperature: 41.2.        
	As hot, dry westerlys are sweeping across south Bengal resulting in a drastic rise in temperature, we have issued a heat wave warning for the next 24 hours. The conditions are quite similar to what prevailed between April 18 and 27, said an official of the Regional Meteorological Centre, in Alipore.        
	A hot spell is called a heat wave when the maximum temperature on more than two consecutive days exceeds the normal mark by at least five degrees.        
	With a loo-like condition prevailing in the afternoon, Fridays discomfort index  measured on the basis of temperature, humidity, wind flow and other factors  touched 64 degrees Celsius, a cruel nine degrees above normal. Even the minimum temperature, at 28.6 degrees, was three degrees above normal.                  
	Loo is characterised by strong hot and dry wind blowing over northern, western and parts of eastern India during the day time in summer. When the maximum temperature ranges between 40 and 45 degrees, it can cause sunstroke.        
	Every time the temperature rises like this, hot and dry wind from the western parts of the country gains in strength and moisture-laden wind from the south becomes weak. This time, too, dry and warm wind from the west has been sweeping across south Bengal, the official explained.        
	Is there any respite in sight? Not for at least the next 24-48 hours. The lower troposphere does not have enough moisture to trigger a Norwester, which alone can bring some relief in the middle of summer. Indications are that the westerlys will continue to blow over south Bengal, not allowing the mercury to drop, the weatherman told Metro.        
	As for Saturdays forecast, the official said: It will be quite hot, with the temperature likely to range between 41 and 28 degrees Celsius. The heat will be dry and there could be loo in the afternoon.        
	Calcutta reeled under a 10-day heat wave from April 18 to 27, the period which saw the mercury cross the 40-degree mark on eight days  unprecedented in six decades of recorded summers in the city.        
	On April 20, 2002, the mercury had touched 43 degrees Celsius, resulting in seven deaths across south Bengal. Calcuttas hottest ever day in May was May 28, 1958, when the maximum temperature was 43.7 degrees Celsius.

	A woman wanted to buy an air-conditioner. At the home appliance section in the mall, she was spoilt for choice. There were window ACs, split ACs and multi-split ACs. One had dual display, another combined art  the front of the AC had a painting  with technology. One promised to save power, one to kill the bird flu virus while another claimed it would work wonders for her skin. But being a true-blue representative of the middle classes, the woman gravitated towards the one brand whose box bore the most irresistible word in the world  free. A premium brand had waived the installation fee, usually around Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,200.         
	The next day two men came to her house for the installation. Taking a look at her room, they said she would need an angle to place the condenser in the balcony. Thatll be Rs 1,200, one said. But I thought the installation was FREE, she shrieked. The men were adamant so she called up the store.         
	Yes maam, the installation is free, but you will have to pay for any accessories required, said the glib salesperson.         
	But an angle costs Rs 750, why should I pay Rs 1200? the woman asked.        
	Okay, pay Rs 750, came the reply.         
	The workmen started the installation. An hour later, they called out: You need a 20ft hose to drain the water from the AC.         
	But shouldnt the AC come with a water hose? Yes it does, but this ones too short, you need an extension. Thatll be Rs 300.        
	The woman could feel her blood pressure rising. They settled for Rs 250.         
	Another hour later. You need a three point electrical wire.         
	Doesnt the AC have it?         
	Yes it does, but its too short. You need a 3ft extension. Thatll be Rs 200.         
	The woman took out her purse and shelled out Rs 1,200.        
	The workmen left. She turned on the AC  the cool air cured her of her freebie fixation for life.

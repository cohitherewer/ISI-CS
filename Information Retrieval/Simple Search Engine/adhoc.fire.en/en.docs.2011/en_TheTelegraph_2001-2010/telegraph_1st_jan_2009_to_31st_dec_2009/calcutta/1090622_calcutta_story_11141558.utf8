The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Monsoon flow out of sight for 48 hours
                                                                                                               Monsoon flow out of sight for 48 hours
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Sundays sweltering heat will continue for at least another 48 hours with the weatherman ruling out the possibility of the dormant monsoon current over Bengal being activated in the next few days.        
	There isnt a possibility of activation of the monsoon flow in this part of the country. So the next 48 hours will be as hot and humid as the past few days, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.        
	The situation looks grim in some parts of south Bengal, such as Bankura and Purulia, where a heat wave-like condition could prevail even a month after the monsoon was dragged to the state, much ahead of schedule, by Aila.        
	The mercury soared to 38.1 degree Celsius  four degrees above normal  on Sunday, making it the hottest June day since 2005.        
	The maximum temperature on June 2, 2005, was 40.6 degree Celsius.        
	Sundays minimum temperature was 29.7 degree Celsius, three points above normal, and the humidity ranged between 93 and 56 per cent. The discomfort index, at 67 degree Celsius, was 12 degrees above normal.        
	Is there any indication of the monsoon being activated this week? Its too early to say but it seems the flow would gain strength and bring rain towards the end of the week, said a weather official.        
	Till the monsoon is energised, the only source of relief from the oppressive heat could be the occasional thunderstorm. Though chances are thin, we are not ruling out the possibility of localised, isolated thunderstorms. But thunderstorms bring only temporary relief. Respite will come only when the monsoon flow gets activated, Debnath told Metro.        
	A silver lining, though, emerged during the day  the southwest monsoon, after remaining almost static for 26 days, finally started moving into the mainland and conditions seemed favourable for its further advance.

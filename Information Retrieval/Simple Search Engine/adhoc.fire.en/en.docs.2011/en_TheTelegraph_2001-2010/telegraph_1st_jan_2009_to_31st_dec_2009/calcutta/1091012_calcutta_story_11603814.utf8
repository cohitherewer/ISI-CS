The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sainthood halo for city shelter
                                                                                                               Sainthood halo for city shelter
          SUBHAJOY ROY                                          Jeanne Jugans bust at St Josephs Home. (Amit Datta)      
	A nun with a Calcutta connection has beaten Mother Teresa to sainthood.        
	As Pope Benedict XVI canonised five new saints at Vatican City on Sunday, ripples of joy spread across a south Calcutta shelter for the elderly basking in the halo of its founder.        
	Frenchwoman Jeanne Jugan, described by Vatican Radio as an authentic Mother Teresa ahead of her time, died before her name became associated with the city and before the nun she has been compared with was born in Macedonia.        
	But Little Sisters of the Poor, a Catholic mission Jugan helped set up in 1839 at St Servan in France, has had a Calcutta address for 127 years.         
	This is in fact the first of our 15 homes for Indias indigent elderly, and was set up way back on November 30, 1882. We now have 150 inmates and 15 sisters in service. We receive support from many young volunteers, Sister Jean, the Mother Superior of St Josephs Home on AJC Bose Road, told Metro.        
	Born Marie de la Croix, Jugan died in 1879, three years before Little Sisters of the Poor ventured into India through this city and 31 years before Mother Teresa was born.        
	We are extremely happy at Jeanne Jugans canonisation. This will inspire us to continue serving elderly people and achieve our objective of giving them an honourable existence, said Sister Jean.        
	St Josephs Home, run by the mission, now spreads over 450 acres.        
	For former marketing executive Anand Kumar, 75, this is more than a home. I have been a happy man for the past seven years that I have been staying here, he said on Sunday evening. Kumar hadnt bothered to save anything for his future while working for a pharmaceutical company. Disowned and disillusioned after retirement, he ended up at St Josephs Home. I cant imagine staying anywhere else.        
	So how does Kumar and the other inmates intend celebrating Jeanne Jugan being canonised?        
	We have been waiting for Sundays ceremony since the announcement was made in March. I am sure the authorities will arrange a befitting celebration, he said.        
	According to Sister Jean, Little Sisters of the Poor will celebrate its founders sainthood on Monday.         
	We will celebrate it with the inmates, their families and our volunteers, she added.        
	A carnival to raise funds for the organisation is scheduled to be held at the shelter on October 25.

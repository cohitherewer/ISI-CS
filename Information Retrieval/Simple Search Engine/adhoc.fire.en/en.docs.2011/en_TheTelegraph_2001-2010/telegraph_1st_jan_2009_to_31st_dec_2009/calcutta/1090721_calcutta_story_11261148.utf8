The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cloud over eclipse experience
                                                                                                               Cloud over eclipse experience
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Rain is threatening to eclipse Wednesdays total solar eclipse.        
	A good view of the eclipse from the city and its adjoining areas appears unlikely, warned Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre, in Alipore. Calcutta and the rest of south Bengal are likely to experience heavy to very heavy showers in the next 24 hours. The condition may persist on Wednesday, too.        
	The cloud cover and the grim prediction have dampened the spirits of scientists and skygazers who had been planning for long to watch the celestial event that will occur again in India after 105 years.        
	We are keeping our fingers crossed, hoping the sky will clear up at the right moment, said Debiprosad Duari, the director (research amp; academic) of the MP Birla Planetarium. As long as the sun is visible, the eclipse can be watched.        
	As eclipse enthusiasts woke up to the ominous sight of an overcast sky, the planetarium was flooded with enquiries about whether the event could be visible through the clouds. Not willing to take chances, many enthusiasts have shifted to safer locations such as Patna or Barauni.        
	The Birla Industrial and Technological Museum has organised a show on simulated solar eclipse to ensure Calcuttans do not lose out if the sky on Wednesday turns out cloudy. We have decided to host the show because of the weather, said museum director E. Islam.        
	Birla Planetarium was also bombarded with queries stemming from misconceptions, which scientists tried hard to dispel. Many pregnant women were worried that something bad might happen to the foetus. The eclipse is a natural phenomenon and it cannot harm human beings in any way. But one must take precautions while gazing at the sun, said Duari.        
	Others wanted to know about the best locations to watch the event from and the percentage of the eclipse to be visible from Calcutta. The city, Duari said, will witness 90.2 per cent of the total solar eclipse.        
	There was a series of calls from students who sought scientific explanations of various aspects of the eclipse.        
	Another common query was about the availability of solar goggles and filters, through which one should look at the sun. The protective eyewear is being distributed by the planetarium and also various amateur scientific groups, such as the Paschim Banga Vigyan Mancha.

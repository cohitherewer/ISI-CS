The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A sports club by the river
                                                                                                               A sports club by the river
        SUBHRO SAHA                          An artists impression of Calcutta Riverside Club                                        
	A 100,000sq ft sports club coming up on the Hooghly, a 20-minute drive from Taratala, is set to raise the clubbing bar.        
	The Rs 30-crore Calcutta Riverside Club, expected to be ready by 2011, is part of the 262-acre Calcutta Riverside integrated township in Batanagar and will apparently be the largest composite private sports club in the country. It will also be the only such facility attached to a golf course and a landscaped marina with docking and servicing facility for private boats and yachts.        
	The club will of course boast an internationally benchmarked design and state-of-the-art features. But what will set it apart is that itll sit next to a five-star hotel, a nine-hole executive golf course with a driving range and a riverfront promenade, says Sumit Dabriwala, the managing director of Riverbank Developers, the company developing the township.        
	Facilities will include a fully equipped gymnasium, library, theatre, two swimming pools, synthetic tennis courts, conference rooms, childrens play area, a bar and a health spa. It will also have bar games, darts, pool, squash, table tennis and badminton.        
	The clubs design is developed to obtain dynamic spaces within the building. Each level is connected visually providing a panoramic view of activities on other floors. The adjacent 9-hole, 1,785-yard, par-3 executive golf course is spread over 28 acres, with a clubhouse.        
	The developers are planning to tie up with coaches and sports personalities to operate coaching clinics for budding talent. A sports club of this magnitude is a great idea to popularise sports among kids, many of whom are hooked to TV or video games, says former Indian Davis Cup coach Akhtar Ali.        
	The marina will have jogging tracks, landscaped lawns, elaborately designed street furniture and light fixtures reminiscent of the cast-iron work of old Calcutta. To accentuate the river experience, F amp;B outlets, signature shops and galleries with a direct river view would come up on the promenade.

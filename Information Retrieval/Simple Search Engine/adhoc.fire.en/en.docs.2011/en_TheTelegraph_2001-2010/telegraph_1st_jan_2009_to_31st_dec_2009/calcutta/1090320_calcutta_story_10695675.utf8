                                                                                                               Hoax call triggers airport scare
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A hoax call made from a satellite phone triggered a bomb scare at Calcutta airport on Thursday afternoon.         
	The caller, claiming to be an LTTE militant, dialled the city airport around 3.30pm and said a bomb had been planted on a flight and timed to explode in two hours.        
	A telephone operator took the call and informed senior officials.        
	Security was immediately tightened in the domestic, international and cargo terminals and anyone other than passengers was barred from entering for two hours.        
	The terminals were cordoned off and security personnel and the bomb squad scanned all public areas. Vehicles were stopped 50 metres from the buildings.        
	All flights due for take-off between 3.30pm and 6pm were searched, but nothing was found. No flight was delayed because of the search operation, though, the official said.        
	Normality was restored around 6pm.         
	The caller hadnt been traced till late on Thursday.

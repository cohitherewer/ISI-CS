          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The government is trying to speed up the replacement of old commercial vehicles and conversion of two-stroke autos to LPG by offering waivers and sops to operators.        
	Transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury met operators on Tuesday and promised to remove roadblocks in the conversion process. He is scheduled to meet banks and oil companies soon.        
	The secretary announced a partial waiver of penalty for default on payment of taxes by auto operators.         
	The penalty, Rs 20,000-30,000 in most cases, has been fixed at Rs 2,500, Chowdhury said.

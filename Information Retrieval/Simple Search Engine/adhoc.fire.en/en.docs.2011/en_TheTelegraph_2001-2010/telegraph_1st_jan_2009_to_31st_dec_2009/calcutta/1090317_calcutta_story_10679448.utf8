The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bomb scare near CMs house
                                                                                                               Bomb scare near CMs house
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	An abandoned black bag triggered panic in Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees Palm Avenue neighbourhood on Monday.         
	The bag was spotted a few hundred meters from the chief ministers home in the afternoon and the bomb squad and sniffer dogs were rushed to the spot. People were shouting about a bomb in the bag but we found only clothes inside. It was a false alarm, said an officer of Karaya police station.        
	A probe revealed a 22-year-old student, who was carrying a black bag, and a 35-year old employee of a private firm had together hired a taxi at Howrah station around noon. After keeping the bag in the boot, they had directed the driver to go to Palm Avenue.        
	The older passenger got off near 73 Palm Avenue and the driver took out the bag and kept in on the road, thinking it belonged to him. The man didnt notice the driver had brought out his co-passengers bag. The taxi sped away, leaving the bag in the high-security locality, the officer said.        
	The student took the taxi to his hostel in Tollygunge. When he asked for his bag, the driver realised his mistake. They returned to Palm Avenue and found the place teeming with cops.         
	The student told us about the goof-up and we returned his bag, the officer added.

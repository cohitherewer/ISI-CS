The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Blame game in risky skies
                                                                                                               Blame game in risky skies

	The cockpit and the control tower are locked in combat, triggering turbulence both in the air and on the ground.        
	Pilots have blamed archaic air traffic control (ATC) procedures followed at Calcutta airport for the recent spate of close shaves, saying that time and information crucial to flight safety are often lost in allegedly redundant communication.        
	Those in the control room counter the allegation by insisting that many pilots are careless and arrogant to the point of ignoring routine questions and instructions.        
	For the passenger, the war of words between the cockpit and the control room can only spell trouble.        
	A veteran flight commander said the authorities had repeatedly ignored complaints from pilots about the difficulties faced by them while communicating with the city ATC.        
	Nowhere else do we have to confirm visibility within minima when it is bright and sunny or answer several times how many passengers have gone through the security check. Pilots find such instructions irritating, and their concentration could waver by the time the information they actually need from the ATC finally arrives, he told Metro.        
	The flight commander said this was the reason why Calcutta was reporting too many close shaves for an airport with thinner air traffic than the other metros.        
	The latest in a line of near-misses at Calcutta airport occurred on June 12, when a SpiceJet aircraft scheduled to take off for Delhi around 5.25pm was waiting six feet beyond the holding point adjacent to the runway while a Kingfisher plane was just about to land. The pilot of the Kingfisher flight, which was coming from Jamshedpur, was asked to abort landing and circle the airport till the SpiceJet craft backed off six feet.        
	According to an official, the Kingfisher plane could have landed safely even with the SpiceJet plane stationed beyond the holding point. But you cannot rule out the possibility of the plane landing a little to the right of the runway instead of the middle, in which case its wing would have hit the nose of the stationary aircraft, he added.        
	The Directorate-General of Civil Aviation is investigating whether the SpiceJet pilot or the air traffic control was at fault on that day. We are running the recorded communication between the ATC and the pilot to spot any instance of miscommunication or misinterpretation of information, said H.N. Mishra, the air safety officer (eastern region).        
	An official source confirmed that incidents like these were occurring frequently at the city airport.        
	In almost all such cases it has been found that pilots are at fault. Several pilots have been put through cockpit familiarisation training in recent times after being found to have made potentially dangerous mistakes, said a senior DGCA official from Delhi.        
	Pilots tend to ignore instructions from the ATC. They are at times careless and at times overconfident, the official added. A senior pilot contested the allegation, saying most near-misses were the result of miscommunication.         
	The authorities need to review all obsolete procedures before blaming it on pilots. Standard ATC phrases are overused, and many of those used are not required. The strain on pilots increases when they deal with ATC personnel in Calcutta, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Wait-and-watch for flu amp; flight 
                                                                                                               Wait-and-watch for flu amp; flight 
  - Bookings for foreign holidays poised to pick up late this festive season          SANJAY MANDAL                                                  
	Four weeks to go for Puja and wanderlust-struck Calcuttans wanting to holiday abroad are playing the waiting game with airlines and travel operators.        
	There is a definite shift in trend. We expect more last-minute bookings this year than in previous years because of factors both positive and negative, said Anil Punjabi, the chairman (east) of the Travel Agents Federation of India.        
	While the swine flu scare has prompted many to wait and watch, the rest are betting on cheaper deals from desperate travel operators closer to Puja and the advantage of the visa-on-arrival facility in some countries. The prevailing exchange rates of some currencies also seem to be a deterrent to advance bookings, said Punjabi.        
	An official of the Airlines Operators Committee confirmed that bookings on international flights from Calcutta were lower this year than in the run-up to last Puja. Usually seats are sold out by now but this year most international flights have recorded 60 to 70 per cent bookings for the Puja week, he said.        
	So does that mean that fewer Calcuttans would be holidaying abroad this Puja?         
	People have definitely been travelling less this year. But we hope travel will pick up as the festive week draws nearer, said a representative of Kingfisher Airlines.         
	Kingfisher has just launched its all-economy flight to Bangkok, a favourite with holidaymakers from the east.        
	 We have been receiving 100 to 300 visa applications every day. We hope to host a good number of tourists during Puja now that we have checked the spread of swine flu and eased visa rules, said Manop Mekprayoonthong, the Thai consul-general in Calcutta.        
	Businessman Kaushik Ghosal, who holidays abroad with his wife and two daughters every alternate Puja, intends going to a south Asian destination this year but hasnt yet decided which. I usually book at least two months in advance but I would prefer to wait this year and see where I get the best deal. The fact that I dont need to apply for visas in advance for Thailand, Mauritius and Sri Lanka is an incentive to wait longer, he said.        
	An Air India spokesperson said there was a heavy rush for bookings on the low-cost Air India Express flights to Bangkok and Singapore. But full-service airlines are feeling the pinch of fewer bookings than usual, according to travel operators.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Weekend rain hope
                                                                                                               Weekend rain hope
                            
	The weatherman on Thursday held out hope of weekend rain after weeks of hot and dry weather.        
	There is respite in sight, said an official of the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore, in the form of rainfall in parts of south Bengal, including Calcutta, in the next 48 hours.        
	Calcutta on Friday would see a cloudy sky. Theres possibility of thunderclouds towards the afternoon. Temperatures are likely to stay within the normal range. Parts of north Bengal are already getting rain and south Bengal should get rain over the weekend, he said.        
	On Thursday, Calcutta saw no rainfall though the minimum relative humidity was a very high 60 per cent. The high humidity resulted in a discomfort index of 64 degree Celsius, nine degrees above normal, though the maximum temperature was normal at 35.7 degree Celsius.        
	The weathers steadily improving now. The hot, dry westerlys and northwesterlys from central and north India, responsible for the heat wave between April 18 and 28, have been arrested. There is significant moisture incursion in the lower troposphere from the Bay of Bengal, making the conditions conducive to rain, said the weatherman.

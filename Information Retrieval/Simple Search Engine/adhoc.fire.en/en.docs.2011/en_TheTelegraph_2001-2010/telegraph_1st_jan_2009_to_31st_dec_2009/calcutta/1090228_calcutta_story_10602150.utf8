The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Life term for dowry death 
                                                                                                               Life term for dowry death 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The second additional sessions judge of Howrah on Friday sentenced five members of a family to life imprisonment in connection with a dowry death.        
	Husband Dipak Jaiswal, a 34-year-old trader, mother-in-law Phoolmoni Debi, 53, and sisters-in-law Arati, Mina and Rina had abetted the suicide of 22-year-old Rina Jaiswal in their Jolapara Masjid Lane house in Howrah in 1999. Since Rinas marriage in February 1997, the five had tortured her for dowry. Her family members gave in to some of the demands but failed to broker peace. On April 21, Rina was found hanging from the ceiling of her bedroom.        
	Her father Keshab Jaiswal filed a complaint at Golabari police station the same day. He said on Friday: I am happy that those who drove my daughter to death have been punished. I would have been happier if they were sentenced to death.

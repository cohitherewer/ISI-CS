The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sweat amp; fret over power cuts 
                                                                                                               Sweat amp; fret over power cuts 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcuttas power woes worsened on Friday with snags forcing two more units to shut down, leaving the city with a massive shortfall that affected students writing their board exams the most.        
	Officials had no explanation for one unit after another crashing  Kolaghat and Santaldih are the latest  in the span of a few days.        
	The chief minister has asked the power secretary to ensure that both state and private power agencies carry out repairs and maintenance on a war footing. He is particularly worried because various board exams are underway, an official said.        
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee went into a huddle with chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti and power secretary Sunil Mitra to take stock of the available options till the shut power units are up and running. We are trying to organise 200MW from Rajasthan, 100MW from Chhattisgarh and 29MW from Tata Power, said an official of the West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd.         
	The chief secretary told reporters at Writers Buildings after the meeting that the power department had been asked to ensure adequate back-up for such an emergency. The chief minister has also made it clear that power plants must be operated and maintained properly.         
	The managing director of the State Power Development Corporation, S. Mahapatra, headed for Santaldih later in the day to supervise repairs.        
	A senior official said the situation could improve over the weekend. The 210MW fifth unit of the Bandel plant has been repaired. A 300MW unit of the Sagardighi plant that had to be shut down because of a choked condenser has been repaired. We expect these units to be fully functional by Saturday.        
	The combined shortfall in the city and the districts shot up to 700MW. The duration of power cuts ranged between one and two hours in the city and up to three hours at a stretch in the districts.

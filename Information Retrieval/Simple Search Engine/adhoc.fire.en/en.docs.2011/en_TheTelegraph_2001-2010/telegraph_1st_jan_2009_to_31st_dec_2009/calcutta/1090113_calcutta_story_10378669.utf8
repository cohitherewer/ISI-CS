                      Sauntering through art lane                    Im not an abstractionist. Im not interested in the relationship of color or form or anything else. Im interested only in expressing basic human emotions: tragedy, ecstasy, doom, and so on  Mark Rothko        Any artist, for that matter, interprets the world around him/her through the creations and conveys his/her basic human emotions, trying to bridge the gap between the artist and the viewer. The stage is set for a silent yet vibrant dialogue. The on-going month-long exhibition of art works, Bengal 2009, by both eminent city artists as well as upcoming ones is a testimony of this. Here distinguished artists, including Prakash Karmakar, Aditya Basak, Amitava Dhar, Partha Pratim Deb, Sunil De and Shekhar Roy, display their works along with artists like Tapash Biswas, Debasish Barui, Nantu Behari Das. Mixed media works by Supam Adhikary, Sourav Jana and Anindya Roy share space with wood cuts by Rajesh Deb (one of his exhibits appears here), bronze sculptures by Subrata Biswas, acrylic on canvas by Dipak Kundu, Ashoke Mullick and Ritendra Roy. Also on display are paintings by Kartick Chandra Pyne and Paritosh Sen. The assorted range of artists and their works allow viewers to contemplate on the present art scenario. The show leads one to travel the transition of the phase to complete the cycle of discovering a new moment of experiences and vibrating expressions.

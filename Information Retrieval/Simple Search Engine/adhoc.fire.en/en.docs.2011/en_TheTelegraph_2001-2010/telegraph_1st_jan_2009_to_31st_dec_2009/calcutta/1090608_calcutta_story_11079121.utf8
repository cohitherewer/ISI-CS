The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Samaritans for Sunderbans line up to provide healing touch
                                                                                                               Samaritans for Sunderbans line up to provide healing touch

	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee may have failed to walk the talk on flooding the Sunderbans with relief, but Calcuttans are walking the extra mile to reach out to the Aila-struck islanders.        
	From organising street gigs to raise funds for the disaster zone to networking for collection of food and other relief materials, Samaritans for the Sunderbans are doing what the government should have done.        
	Vehicles carrying food, clothes and other materials donated by residents of the city have been lining the highway that leads to Godkhali Ghat, the starting point for despatch of relief materials by large and small mechanised boats, every day.        
	A group of six friends from Sonarpur collected relief materials worth Rs 1 lakh in two-and-a-half days. Last Sunday, all of us met for our regular adda and were discussing how the government has failed in reaching relief to the interiors of the Sunderbans when it dawned on us that we should be doing our bit, recalled Deepankar Bose, an employee of Indian Overseas Bank.         
	While the government has been supplying mostly puffed rice, jaggery and water, citizens are filling in the relief gaps with biscuits, baby food, clothes, candles and even matchboxes.        
	Kids need nutrition, they cannot survive on puffed rice and jaggery. So, we arranged for some biscuits and baby food, said Mithi Chatterjee, a homemaker who joined her friends and their spouses on a journey to Satjelia island on Wednesday.        
	A 60-member citizens group that had arranged for a Scorpio to collect relief materials on Middleton Row had to bring in a truck.         
	Someone came from Park Circus with a truckload of relief materials. Another came with 1,000 bottles of water. A person we didnt know brought 400kg of rice. Officials of a company with an office on Middleton Row saw what we were doing and arranged for a truck, said activist Mudar Patherya.         
	The group, which has already raised Rs 7 lakh, is now drawing attention to the cause through gigs on Park Street by Francis Lepcha, Ben Wesley, Sumit Ramachandran and Nondon Bagchi from Hip Pocket, and singers Rila Banerjee and Rianne Selwyn. Actor, film-maker and singer Anjan Dutt joined the group over the weekend.        
	We came to Park Street for dinner and were surprised to see them performing. We contributed some money on learning that it was for the victims of Aila, said Vaishali Kathuria, waiting to enter Peter Cat.        
	Even the parking attendant wants to do his bit. On the first day of our collection drive on Middleton Row, the parking attendant demanded money for all 12 hours that our car stood there. He settled for Rs 50, which he later put into our box, said a volunteer.         
	Samar Chowdhury, 51, is one of those who wants to do more than donate money and materials. He wants to be there among the victims.        
	Ten of us from Garia-Mahamayapur School Road, aged between 22 and 60 , will head for the Sunderbans on Monday with chire (200kg), gur (20kg), buns, biscuits, batasha (60kg) and medicines. We have also collected clothes, he said.        
	The price of hiring a mechanised boat is steep, though. A launch to Kumirmari costs around Rs 3,500. Samaritans have to pay Rs 500 more if they want to travel to Lahiripur and Luxbagan, on Satjelia island.        
	Since May 26, my three mechanised boats have been on relief duty each day, said Babla Das of Chandana Tour amp; Travels.        
	Sushanta Roy Chowdhury, an IT professional from Khardah who has just returned from a trip, says much more needs to be done. Me and my friends thought we were carrying adequate relief materials. But once we reached there and saw the extent of devastation and the number of needy people, we realised that we should have brought more food and water with us.         
	Sukumar Houli, a Gosaba-based teacher who has been accompanying groups of volunteers to the interiors, said he was touched by the support of Calcuttans. In many parts of the Sunderbans, people survived the first few days after Aila struck on relief provided by citizens. I receive at least 20 calls every day from people who want to come with relief materials.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Job fraud with fake website
                                                                                                               Job fraud with fake website
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A Delhi-based computer student has been arrested by city police for allegedly cheating job seekers through a fake Railway Recruitment Board website.         
	Subh Prakash Singh, in his mid-20s, took bank drafts of Rs 25,000 to Rs 1 lakh from each candidate who approached him for a railway job, said the police. The website run by Singh (www.railwayrecruitmentboardkolkata.com) is similar to the original Railway Recruitment Board website (www.rrbkolkata.org) in every respect, except the contact numbers, said an investigator.        
	The police are looking for Singhs associates. The fraud came to light in February this year when D.K. Srivastava, the chairman of the board, which has its headquarters in Calcutta, lodged a complaint with Ultadanga police station.        
	Singh was arrested in his home in Delhis Pandav Nagar on Tuesday.        
	Incriminating documents and a hard disk were seized from his house, added the investigator.        
	Singh was brought to the city on transit remand on Thursday and produced in Sealdah court. He was remanded in police custody.         
	Singh,who is pursuing a Master in Computer Applications degree, had provided an address in Delhis Vasant Kunj while buying the domain space to upload the website. We have no clue how many people he has duped, said an investigator.

	The column Autumn Flush is welcome. The first instalment Log on, be in touch (9 August) was touching and helpful. The writer has analysed well the problems of elderly people who are not computer-savvy. Grown-up children have little time to teach parents, forgetting the fact that once their parents showed a lot of patience to teach them. Kudos to Sajni Mukherji for starting computer classes for senior citizens.

	Many have drawn great pleasure from Satyajit Rays films, especially the Goopy-Bagha series. They have given the industry outstanding actors, such as Rabi Ghosh, though not much has been written about him. The article Forty years of magic (May 10), commemorating 40 years of Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne, should have mentioned Ghoshs genius.

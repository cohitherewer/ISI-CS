                      In full bloom                    A self-taught artist who turned professional at the age of 56, Pushpa Bagrodia only uses watercolour in her paintings that depict the splendour of nature. Her love for nature, vivid thoughts about it and a keen eye for detail are translated into her paintings. The softness of the watercolours she uses is unique and intense, and portrays nature in all its glory. In Your Garden, the ongoing show of her paintings, her study of the flowers makes it clear that her inspiration is numerous and varied. Yet, each creation exhibits a similar voice, a distinctive tone and style. Frequently, she employs the first person glimpse in the flowers that she paints, which lends her work the immediacy of a dialogue between two people, the creator and the viewer. Her flowers convey distinct and elegant emotions and thoughts rather than objective, concrete truths. The viewer is thus invited to compare his own experiences, emotions and thoughts with those expressed in the lyrical construct present in these flowers.                  Event: An exhibition of watercolour paintings by Pushpa Bagrodia When: Till November 17; 11 am - 8 pm Where: Gallery Sanskriti, 5C Alipore Park Road

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Presidency naysayers rear head
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Presidency naysayers rear head
          OUR BUREAU                           Presidency College                                  
	A CPM-backed teachers association has vowed to oppose the move to confer unitary university status on Presidency College, drawing charges that the traditional opponents are again putting their interest ahead of that of the 192-year-old institution.        
	We will oppose the unitary university status for Presidency. We want the college to become an affiliating university, a senior leader of the West Bengal Government College Teachers Association said on Monday.        
	According to him, the association members are unanimous that all 36 government colleges in the state should be affiliated to Presidency College to ensure their overall improvement.        
	Sources said that behind the cleverly crafted official line  which also calls for an upgrade of the college  there was the vested interest of the teachers lobby at work.        
	Once the university status is granted, the current teachers of Presidency College will have to go through a rigorous selection process to retain their jobs in the institute. And even if they are allowed to stay on, they will no longer remain government employees and lose their eligibility to continue as members of the association, said an education department official. The association, he added, will lose its prominence once the Presidency teachers exit its fold.        
	The teachers in other government colleges, too, have their vested interests. Now, they are routinely transferred to Presidency. But once the College Street campus is declared a university, they will lose out on the opportunity, the official pointed out.        
	A retired Calcutta University professor said freeing Presidency of the varsitys control would trigger demand for autonomy from other government colleges as well, which in turn will further weaken the 1,300-member association.        
	Several city-based government colleges  such as Bethune, Maulana Azad, Lady Brabourne and Goenka College of Commerce and Business Administration  have been toying with the idea of asking for autonomy or the unitary university status.        
	It is clear that the association members are not bothered about Presidencys upgrade. They are only trying to serve their own interest, said an alumnus of the college.        
	Those rooting for Presidencys autonomy think the affiliating university status will come in the way of the institutes pursuit of academic excellence.        
	We are demanding autonomy mainly because we want the college to become a world-class institution. If it is given an affiliating university status, the focus of the institute will shift from academics to administrative affairs as it will have to conduct examinations and award degrees, said a Presidency alumnus.        
	Besides, he pointed out, an affiliating university status for Presidency will violate a policy decision of the Centre.        
	The Union human resource development ministry is trying to reduce the load of affiliating universities by encouraging upgrade of prominent undergraduate colleges to unitary universities.        
	The association members, however, are sticking to their demand and offering their own logic. We want Presidency to become an affiliating university so that some good government colleges can come under its umbrella, said an association leader.        
	Aware that the government will push for the unitary university status for the college during the ongoing winter session of the Assembly, the association held a marathon meeting on Sunday night to chalk out its plan of action.         
	We will start wearing black badges to protest the government move and then call a days strike. If our demand is not met, we can even go on an indefinite strike, said a member.        
	But as of now the government is in no mood to bow down to the teachers demand.        
	The process of drafting a bill seeking to declare Presidency a unitary university is on. The bill is being drafted exactly according to the model announced by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, said a source in the education department.

	Walk in to drive out is the way to go this weekend as the festive fun revs up at 22 Camac Street with SBI presents The Telegraph Auto Carnival 2009.        
	A look-touch-feel-drive experience awaits customers trooping in from October 9 to 11 as a dozen-plus models of the major auto makers will be showcased.        
	From small cars like the time-tested Hyundai Santro and Chevy Spark to the latest mudpluggers like Toyotas Fortuner and Fords Endeavour, the fair will have them all. Plus, premium sedans like the Altis and the Skoda Superb. The two SUVs, the latest entrants in the market along with the new Endeavour, are sure to be crowd-pullers.        
	Actor and wildlife enthusiast Sabyasachi Chakraborty will have his eyes set on the Toyota Fortuner when he goes to inaugurate the fair on Friday. I really liked the auto fair last year. This time, I want to take out the Toyota Fortuner for a spin, said Feluda.        
	Apart from the soft purr of four-wheelers that can be taken for a test spin, there will be the vroom of super bikes. The carnival, in its third year, is expanding to include two-wheelers with both Yamaha and Hero Honda showing off their power bikes on the last weekend before Dhanteras-Diwali.        
	Calcutta will get a first look of the 223 cc ZMR as Hero Honda launches its Rs 1 lakh bike. We will showcase our new product and reach out to the citys youth, offering them an affordable yet technologically advanced bike, said Rajib Chakrabarty of Hero Honda.                                
	Giving ZMR competition on the two-wheel turf will be Yamahas R15, a 149cc super sport bike.        
	The auto carnival gives us an opportunity to reach out to a larger audience. We intend to show our 153cc Fazer along with the R15, said Ravi Rastogi of Yamaha.        
	On the four-wheeler front, Tata Motors, a regular at the carnival, will be showcasing Indica Vista and Indigo CS.        
	The fair has always given us good leads that we have managed to convert into sales. With Dhanteras-Diwali round the corner, we are looking for good response this time, said Gautam Mukherjee, the regional manager (east).        
	Gagandeep Singh, Chevys zonal sales manager (east), recalled the spot bookings for Spark at the last fair. This time the Spark would be joined by the U-VA and Singh is looking forward to a good response.        
	To make the carnival more consumer-friendly, there will have an SBI kiosk for on-the-spot car loans.         
	By participating in this carnival we hope to get a bigger chunk of the car loan business. We are offering extremely competitive rates of 8 per cent in the first year and we have streamlined the paperwork, said an SBI official.

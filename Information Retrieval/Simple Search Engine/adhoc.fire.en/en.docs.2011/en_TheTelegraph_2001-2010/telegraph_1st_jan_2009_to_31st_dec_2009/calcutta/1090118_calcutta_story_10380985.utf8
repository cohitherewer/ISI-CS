The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Too crowded for comfort
                                                                                                               Too crowded for comfort

	The 42nd anniversary exhibition of the Birla Academy of Art amp; Culture has attracted many big names of Calcuttas art world. But it is too crowded for its own good.        
	Even a cursory glance revealed some works by young artists that looked different in a jungle of cliches and pastiche. Paresh Hazra from Birbhum has created what looks like a ball of strings in pastel shades of blue, red and black with paper on pulp. It is a tightly structured work, and one can use the same phrase to describe Uday Mandals diptych of a young woman in bed in lively shades of pink, blue and cream. The effect is photographic, yet far from photo-realistic.         
	Banshemphang Langlong has thought up a plausible alternative to common representations of the man-woman binary. The sculptor shows the single breast of a woman with a well-rounded arm conjoined with a mans shoulder. The contrast is striking.                 
	The art of Laxma Goud, the artist from Andhra Pradesh, goes hand in hand with eroticism. He brings to the fore the basic instinct that we have learnt to cleverly conceal. In his current exhibition at Galerie 88, the veteran artist again explores how the sexual drive is often the stimulus of creativity in his prints (intaglio), drawings and terracotta sculpture. His favourite goats with massive members are there, and so are the lusty men, and women with high breasts, who would never say no to a tumble in the hay.               
	Life in crowded Indian metropolises comes alive in Nisreen Moohchhalas works now being exhibited at the Seagull Media and Research Centre. Jugglers perform on streets, people enact the daily drama of their lives in box-like flats in highrise buildings, pavement dwellers fight it out in their box-like shanties, that are slices of ageless Bharat, goddess-like women devote their lives to drudgery, families embark on long journeys in crowded box-like trains. With all their colour and playfulness Nisreen may be mistaken for a light-hearted artist but the sadness of all her protagonists is unmistakable.               
	An exhibition of young artists has opened at K2. While most of the exhibits were run of the mill, there were two artists who stood out.         
	Soumya Kanti Mukhopadhyays cowherd in grey turns into a divinity as two pairs of blue arms sprout behind him. Dibakar Karmakars paintings are non-figurative but there are suggestions of organic forms in his acrylic paintings.              
	Amal Ghosh and Peter Daglish, both senior artists practising in London, are holding an exhibition of their enamel paintings and lino cuts, respectively, at Ganges Art gallery.         
	Enamel colours add lustre to Ghoshs abstract works with their brilliant, contrasting shades. Daglishs bold and brazen style is best suited to the girls with hot lips and afros. His bars and stripes are eminently suited to these tigresses.       SOUMITRA DAS

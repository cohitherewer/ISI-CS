                 Gone to the head                  
	The Indian Museum boasts of one of the finest collections in Asia, a treasure trove of archaeological, geological and zoological wonders which warrants the utmost care in its curation and conservation.           
	The museum is of immense cultural significance to the nation as a whole and, in particular, to the people of Calcutta. While its refurbishment is to be welcomed, it is vital that this does not destroy the qualities that make it unique.           
	The museum was completed in 1875 to the designs of Walter Granville, the accomplished architect of the General Post Office and high court.           
	It is a fine classical composition of major architectural significance, and an important part of the cultural heritage of both the city and the nation. The current proposal for a mansard roof extension raises fundamental issues for the future integrity of this fine heritage building. It is likely to be severely detrimental to its character and appearance which has already been marred by the flyover.           
	There is a wealth of expertise in India and the UK in the sensitive adaptation and modernisation of historic buildings and museums in ways which reinforce rather than diminish their architectural and historic interest.           
	K.K. Basa, the director of the museum, has stressed that the community is the new curator of the cultural heritage. Given the architectural and cultural importance of the museum, let the community have its say. The plans should be published and subject to the widest possible consulation so that the best advice can be obtained from heritage and museum experts across the world before any irrevocable decisions are made.           
	Philip Davies

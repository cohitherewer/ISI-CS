The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Coal supply snag triggers power cuts 
                                                                                                               Coal supply snag triggers power cuts 
          A STAFF REPORTER                           Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi launches a CD of songs composed by Raja Rammohun Roy at Raja Rammohun Roy Memorial Museum on Amherst Street on Monday morning with the lights and fans not working. The museum went without power for over 30 of the 45 minutes that the governor spent on the premises                                   
	Heavy rain in south Bengal over the past two weeks made Calcutta sweat in the dark for hours on Monday.         
	The showers flooded mines, dampened coal and impeded supply to power plants, triggering a shortfall in the city on Monday.        
	At 7pm, the shortfall in the CESC-served areas was about 135MW. There were rotational power cuts between 60 and 90 minutes in most areas.        
	Bowbazar, College Street, Maniktala, Kankurgachhi, Phoolbagan, Beleghata, Shyambazar, Bagbazar, Hatibagan, Sovabazar, Girish Park, Chandni Chowk, Bhowanipore, Ballygunge, Gariahat and Hazra were some of the areas affected.        
	The power cuts were because of restricted import. The other agencies have been hit by erratic and dwindling supply of coal for around the past 10 days, said a CESC official.        
	At 7pm on Monday, the shortfall in the West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Limited-served areas was around 500MW.         
	The shortfall can only be attributed to the hindered supply. The supply has been severely hit by last weeks showers, said an official of the company.        
	Officials of the power agencies expect the situation to improve in a day or two with the coal supply likely to increase from Tuesday.        
	Metro learnt from the state electricity distribution company official that Eastern Coalfields Limited (ECL) had agreed to supply five rakes of coal (1.5 crore metric tonne) daily for power generation        
	Since September 6, ECL has been supplying just three rakes (90 lakh metric tonne), which has affected power generation over the past eight days. The lower supply, according to ECL, is because of heavy rain flooding the mines, said an official.        
	Debashis Sen, the managing director of the West Bengal Power Development Corporation Limited met Smarajit Chakraborty, the chief managing director of ECL, on Monday to sort out issues affecting the supply of coal.        
	The meeting was fruitful and we were assured that the supply would become normal in a day or two, said Sen.

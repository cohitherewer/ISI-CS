The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Highrises deplete water stock
                                                                                                               Highrises deplete water stock
          OUR BUREAU                              
	The mushrooming of housing estates and their overdependence on groundwater have caused a drastic fall in the citys groundwater level, experts say.         
	Metro had reported on January 16 the findings of a survey by the Central Groundwater Board, which revealed that Calcuttas water level had receded by seven to 11 metres between 1958 and 2003. The fall has been the steepest  11 metres  in the Park Street area.         
	In around 30 per cent of the city, the water level has shrunk to an extent that there could be subsidence in the near future.        
	The spurt in the number of highrises over the past couple of decades and excessive withdrawal of groundwater without any replenishment have contributed to the problem, said Tapas Ghatak, who looks after the environment cell of the CMDA.         
	The highrises have no option but to depend on groundwater as the supply of filtered surface water is far from adequate.        
	The problem would have been less severe had the extraction of groundwater been uniform across the city. The large-scale extraction is restricted to certain zones, resulting in a void in the aquifer. The problem is more pronounced in areas close to the Bypass, where many housing estates have come up, Park Circus and Park Street, said S.P. Sinha Roy, a former member of the groundwater board.         
	The city should be declared a no-extraction zone, the sooner the better, said Sinha Roy.        
	Experts feel the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) is not serious in curbing groundwater extraction.         
	As the chairman of the groundwater board, I had suggested to the CMC a few decades ago that withdrawal of underground water be banned in areas that get filtered surface water. But the authorities did not act on the proposal, said Sinha Roy.         
	Ghatak cited the lack of sops from the administration to promote water recycling, which would have reduced the need for groundwater.        
	A Bypass housing estate developed jointly by the CMDA and a private partner had considered a recycling scheme that would have saved 40 per cent water. But the proposal was dropped as the authorities turned down our pleas for tax concessions, without which the scheme could not have been implemented, said Ghatak.         
	Rainwater harvesting, another way to reduce the dependence on groundwater, is mandatory for housing estates spread across 20,000 sq m or more. The experts demanded similar conditions for smaller estates, too. Such measures are badly needed, as the dwindling number of water bodies and concreting of roadside space have hardly left any room for natural recharging of aquifers, said an expert.         
	Defending CMCs role, municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said licences for deep tubewells were not being issued in areas where the groundwater level had dropped alarmingly. The number of CMC deep tubewells has been reduced from 300 to 210. Efforts are on to boost the supply of filtered surface water.

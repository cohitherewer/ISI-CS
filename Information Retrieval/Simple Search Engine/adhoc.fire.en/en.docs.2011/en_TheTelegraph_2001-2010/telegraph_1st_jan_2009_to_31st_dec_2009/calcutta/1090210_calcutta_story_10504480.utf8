The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Solar power lights up city homes
                                                                                                               Solar power lights up city homes
          SUBHAJOY ROY                          Ram Chandra Dey uses a solar-powered light in his studio. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha                                  
	Ram Chandra Dey saves Rs 350 on his electricity bill every month. Thats because the artist runs nine bulbs and a fan at his home on solar energy. I have two solar lights in my studio, which are enough for the evening, said the resident of Tanwar Colony in Dum Dum.         
	Asim Burman, who installed a solar panel in his house last month, isnt scared of the summer anymore. One can use the fans even during power cuts. At present I run two lights and a fan on solar power. I want to increase the usage, said the resident of Airport gate number 1.        
	The demand for solar lights and solar water heaters is increasing in the city.         
	Around 700 houses in the city have switched to solar lights and heaters, said S.P. Gon Chowdhury, the director of the West Bengal Renewable Energy Development Agency (WBREDA).        
	Many residents in Salt Lake, New Town and Golf Green are using solar-powered devices. In Kalindi, 17 homes recently installed solar lights and heaters.        
	According to the standard model, if four Compact Fluorescent (CFL) bulbs of nine watts, a fan and a television set are used in a household for six hours every day, a panel worth Rs 25,000 would be required. The government pays a subsidy of Rs 4,800, the consumer has to pay the rest, said Gon Chowdhury.         
	The subsidy has been reduced over the years. When I installed the lights four years ago, I got a subsidy of around Rs 10,000, said Ram Chandra Dey. But the WBREDA director said the subsidy was being reduced to make solar lights commercially viable.        
	If a resident wants to run all the fans and lights as well as other gadgets in the house on solar power, that option is available too. It will cost him between Rs 30,000 and 60,000, said Gon Chowdhury.        
	The initial cost may be high, but there are many benefits. Consumers dont have to worry about power cuts. Power theft is not possible either. One needs to pour some water on the battery once a month by way of maintenance, said Dey.         
	The solar power arrangement, a one-time investment, is energy-efficient too. A nine-watt CFL lamp gives the same light as a 60-watt incandescent bulb. The solar lamp can burn for 8,000 hours, while the latter has a life of around 1,000 hours, said Anupam Boral of Gitanjali Solar Enterprise, which manufactures the solar devices.        
	Solar power will become even more energy-efficient if the Centre subsidises Light Emitting Diodes (LED).        
	A seven-watt LED bulb is equivalent to a nine-watt CFL bulb. An extra bulb can be used with the two watts the consumer saves from each bulb. An LED has a lifespan of 1 lakh burning hours, added Boral.        
	Solar heaters are catching up, too. The 100-litre water heaters are available in two models  with an evacuated collector or with a flat plate collector, costing Rs 17,000 and Rs 25,000, respectively. There is a subsidy of Rs 2,000 on both, said Boral.

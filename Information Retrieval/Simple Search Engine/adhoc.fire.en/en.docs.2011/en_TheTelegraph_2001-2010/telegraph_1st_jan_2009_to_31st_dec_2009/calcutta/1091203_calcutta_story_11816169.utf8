	Abhijeet Sen 12, loves to draw. He also enjoys stitching and makes thermocol models. But he uses his legs for these activities.         
	Aishi Banerjee, 21, is a diehard Bollywood music buff. If you play the tune of a song to her, she can identify it in seconds, says her mother, Parnalekha.        
	Both Abhijeet and Aishi suffer from cerebral palsy, a motor disorder that hampers physical activity and may affect speech, cognition and perception. While Abhijeet is unable to use his hands, Aishi has difficulty speaking.         
	Both of them were participants at the exhibition organised by Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy (IICP) at Birla Industrial and Technology Museum from November 18 to 20. The exhibition highlighted technological tools to aid those who suffer from the disorder.         
	Abhijeet spelled out the word Budge Budge, pointing out the letters with his foot from a specially designed book, in response to queries on where he lived.         
	Aishis friend Sudip Dutta showed visitors how he operated his Gupshup Book, the pages of which held pictures of his Durga puja celebrations. A recorded message explained each picture.         
	Notable was a software called Sanyog, that enables text to be converted to speech.        
	Sanyog and the Gupshup Book were among the software and devices on display at the exhibition.         
	The devices, developed by IIT Kharagpur, Webel in association with IICP, included the Sweepstick, a mouse that lets the user manoeuvre the entire desktop using two switches, and Kathamala, a device that can hold up to 16 pre-recorded messages of eight minutes duration.        
	Said Subhra Chatterjee, the deputy director of communications and resource mobilisation of IICP: Through the exhibition, we want to make people aware of the technology that has opened up the world to cerebral palsy sufferers.        
	We are testing the instruments on patients who come to us for check-ups. If the response is encouraging, there are plans of marketing them commercially through IICP, said computer teacher at IICP, Kakoli Dasgupta.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tribute to first taxman
                                                                                                               Tribute to first taxman
                            
	Not long afterwards, Bhatia located the grave but the inscription was indecipherable. Bhatia convinced the Christian Burial Board that he would restore the writing at his own expense, and now even the name of the well-known mason  T. Gaffin, 63 Regent Street, London responsible for making the marble headstone can be clearly read.         
	Wilson, the son of a wealthy woollen manufacturer, continued his studies while being apprenticed to a local hat maker. His early hero was the economist Adam Smith who wrote the famous Wealth of Nations. Wilson became wealthy himself, by dint of hard labour.         
	It was not The Economist alone that Wilson, who also wrote most of its content then, founded. During the Australian gold rush of 1851, he laid the ground for the formation of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China.         
	In India, he imposed an income tax, created a government paper currency and remodelled the whole system of finance.         
	There is still a riddle about Wilson that remains unsolved. By all accounts, his statue used to stand in Dalhousie Institute, which was demolished in 1960 to construct Telephone Bhavan. Where was it removed from there?         
	Had Wilson been around he might have said only two things are certain in life: taxes and death. What happens to you after death is not certain at all.

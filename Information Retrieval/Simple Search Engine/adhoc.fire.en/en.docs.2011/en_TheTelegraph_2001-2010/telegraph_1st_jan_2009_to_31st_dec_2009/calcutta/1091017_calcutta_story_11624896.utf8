The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Kin claims tourist body
                                                                                                               Kin claims tourist body
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The husband of Kathleen Mary OBryan, the 38-year-old American woman found dead in the Calcutta home of a Facebook friend on Sunday, arrived in the city on Friday morning and claimed her body.        
	Yukio Okamoto, in his mid-30s, arrived in Calcutta from Japan along with a relative. He had married Kathleen five years ago. They had separated last year. Kathleen used to work as a counsellor in Tokyo, said a police officer investigating the death.        
	The autopsy surgeon, in his report, said Kathleen had overdosed on sleeping pills after a spicy, oil-rich dinner on October 10.        
	We are awaiting the viscera report, which will take at least a month, said a cop. After spending two days at a south Calcutta guesthouse, Kathleen had moved to Rohan Prakash Yellores Hindusthan Park flat.

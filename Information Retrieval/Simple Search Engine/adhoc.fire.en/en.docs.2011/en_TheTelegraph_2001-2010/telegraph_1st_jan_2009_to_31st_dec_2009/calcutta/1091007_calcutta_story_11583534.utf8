           Smooth Ride: Hand-pulled rickshaws have a nostalgic association with Calcutta, so they should be allowed to ply in the city (CMC to decide rickshaw fate, July 8). Besides, these vehicles serve as a boon when streets across the city remain water-logged in monsoon.                                     
	This is with reference to the report Parents face testing times, July 2. St Augustines Day Schools plan to introduce a novel system that involves parents in their wards progress and makes them (parents) accountable for their childrens overall performance is welcome.           
	According to the plan, 25 per cent marks would be awarded in terminal and annual examinations on the basis of how parents have groomed their wards physically, mentally and academically.           
	It is a good concept worth trying out, but I dont think all guardians would be pleased with it. Everybody is busy these days and may not be able to devote the extra time required for paying special attention to their children.           
	Besides, many parents are not literate or qualified enough to guide their children properly. So they take the help of a governess or tutor. Who would be accountable for such children? Also, how do the school authorities expect one of the parents to converse with the child in English at home if the parents themselves cannot speak the language?           
	There would be some obstacles in implementing the new system of evaluation, but I am sure that C.R. Gasper, the founder-principal of the school who has more than 40 years of experience in the field of education, would soon overcome them.

	I was shocked to know that the Bengal government has tabled a Bill to protect doctors from the ire of relatives of a patient who died due to negligence (Bill tabled for doctor safety, July 2).             
	Not a single doctors licence has been revoked here by the medical council in spite of numerous patients dying because of medical negligence, whereas in the UK and the US, doctors are made to pay huge compensations and sometimes their licences are cancelled if found guilty of negligence.           
	It is an open secret that doctors receive a cut for referring patients to private laboratories for tests, sometimes even unnecessary ones. A few months back, my father was admitted to a private hospital in south Calcutta, where his medicines were billed on the maximum retail price, but we later found out that some of the medicines were available at half the cost at drug stores.           
	It is tragic that the government is more concerned about doctors than patients. Does the government too have a vested interest in this matter?

	Address not mentioned                     
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee must be congratulated for tabling a Bill to protect doctors who get assaulted unnecessarily by patient parties. However, the law must also ensure that in cases of gross medical negligence, the doctors are prosecuted.

	The state governments move to enable police to nab hospital vandals with non-bailable warrants is welcome. But what about other kinds of violence and destruction of property? The government needs to look into burning and vandalism of buses and other vehicles by mobs or those involved in road accidents. Every year, hundreds of state buses are targeted without any rhyme or reason. Such criminals should also be slapped with stringent cases.

	Does urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya hold the additional charge of minister in charge of school education? Otherwise, why is he so keen to pave the way for yet another school in Salt Lake (Minister backs Sourav school, July 1)? Also, where does this Samaritan hide when schools in the state are in ruins, run without teachers, or without midday meals? What keeps him mum then, and hyperactive now?             
	The Salt Lake plot was reportedly earmarked in the master plan for an educational institution, but how did Sourav Ganguly qualify to bid for building a school there? Does the Left Front, in its penultimate year, deem every Commerce graduate an educationist?           
	The deal requires judicial scrutiny. The CA Block Residents Association will do people a great service by moving court on this issue.           
	Md. Motleb Ali,           
	Mahestala                               
	I read with great dismay the report Court salve for jailed wom-an, July 4. The woman languished in jail for 11 years, waiting for the judiciary to wake up and prepare the paper book for her appeal.             
	It is only the tip of the iceberg  the legal corridors abound with such horror stories. But I would like to ask what salve are we talking about? If after hearing the appeal it is proved in court that the woman was innocent, who will give her back her lost 11 years?           
	Those who can make a difference by hauling up those who have made the system unfeeling and uncaring have themselves become insensitive to suffering. They either couldnt care or wouldnt dare to rock the boat. This is the sad truth of our judicial system today.

	I was shocked to read that an 11-year-old child was beaten up mercilessly for stealing a cellphone (11-year-old bleeds in mob trial for cellphone theft, July 3). If a child can be punished so cruelly, what sort of punishment should be meted out to those who drive rashly, killing innocent people almost every day? Or, what about those politicians who have made the common man a scapegoat in their power games?

	Salt Lake                     
	lA child from the weaker section of society who grows up in such an environment of cruelty and violence may become a hardened criminal later in life. There should be stricter laws to prevent children from being abused, no matter what the provocation.

	Kankurgachhi                     
	It is painful to read how little Mohammed Mushtaq was attacked by his senior co-worker in a city restaurant (Skewer attack on child worker, July 21). Such an incident happened in a city, that too, in broad daylight. The attack could have turned fatal had the police not sent Mushtaq to hospital.             
	This is not new. Child workers are tormented at homes and business establishments but most of these tales of torture are never reported. The government banned the employment of children below 14 years from October 10, 2006, but the ban has remained on paper.           
	These little workers can be seen toiling at roadside dhabas and tea stalls. The enforcement of the ban is a tall ask as it is difficult to crack down on each home and rescue child labourers. One must also remember that if these children are forced out of work, they will starve as the government has not planned for their rehabilitation.           
	Subhankar Mukherjee,           
	Burdwan                     
	lThe incident underscores the state of child workers in our state. What has happened to the pledge of right to education? It is shameful that no step is being taken by the government to rescue the children.           
	Ratan Kumar Halder,           
	Behala                               
	The incident of a pedestrian being punched and kicked by some hawkers allegedly for touching their ware with his foot is most shocking (Punches for pedestrian on pavement for hawkers, July 16). It is certain that the man did not do this on purpose and the footpath was crowded. So the question that arises is whether the pavement is for pedestrians or for hawkers.

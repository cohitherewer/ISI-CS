                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Carnival buzz in fun and food hub

	A carnival has added to the festive frenzy in the citys favourite fun and food stop.        
	The aim of Park Street Carnival, organised by the Society for Park Street Rejuvenation Kolkata (SPARK) in association with t2 and the West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation (WBTDC), is to promote street culture. And no street can be better than Park Street, said Monica Bhargava of the society.        
	Its so common these days to go to malls and coffee shops. We want to make people more aware of Park Streets culture, history and heritage, she added.        
	The festivities started on Saturday with a heritage walk, from Asiatic Society to the South Park Street Cemetery, conducted by Calcutta Walks. An exhibition of pictures of Park Street and the rest of the city was mounted on the Apeejay lawns.        
	An Open Mic session, where people from various walks of life spoke on Park Street, followed.         
	A short film festival at Oxford Bookstore featured diploma films by students of Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute. The selection included the award-winning Laal Juto by Shweta Merchant and Din E Intzaar, made in collaboration with HFF Berlin.        
	While Laal Juto is based on a short story by Kamalkumar Majumdar against the backdrop of Calcutta, Din E Intzaar is a spoof of Bollywood potboilers.        
	The storyline was simple. Boy meets girl. They fall in love. The girls parents dont approve. Theres a villain. There are songs. There is a dream sequence, laughed the cinematographer, Rupanjan Paul, a former student of the film school.         
	The carnival was officially declared open by US consul-general Beth Payne and WBTDC managing director T.V.N. Rao on Saturday evening, before the start of the music fest.        
	Carlton Kitto Jazz Ensemble was first up with popular jazz numbers like Art Blakeys Moanin and Horace Silvers Senor Blues.        
	The best thing about the performance at Allen Park was that it was open to all and free. There were listeners who werent quite familiar with our kind of music but they stayed and listened. It was wonderful, smiled Anjum Katyal, who sang a couple of numbers for the group.        
	Jamination, an Indo-American fusion project with influences of jazz, funk, rock, Afro-Cuban and Latin and reggae in their music, followed next with their take on popular numbers as well as originals.        
	Sunday, the final day of the carnival, saw a dance workshop, a photography contest and more short films. Bands Los Amigos and Yidam took the stage at the Allen Park music fest.         
	Conducting an event or a festival is one of the best ways to promote a place, said Rao.

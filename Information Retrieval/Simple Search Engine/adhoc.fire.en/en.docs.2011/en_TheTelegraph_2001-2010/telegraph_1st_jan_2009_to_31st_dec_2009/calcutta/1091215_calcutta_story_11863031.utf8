The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sure shortcut to disaster
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Sure shortcut to disaster
  - Dividers open at wrong places put lives at risk on NH6           AMRITA GHOSH                          A car illegally switches flanks through an opening in the divider at the starting point of NH 6 the day after a similar breach led to 22 people being killed in a crash; (below) a truck about to commit a similar violation on Kona Expressway. (Gopal Senapati)                                                
	The head-on collision on Bombay Road that claimed 22 lives on Sunday was caused as much by a misconceived opening in the median divider as by the callousness of the trucker who misused it.         
	Calcuttas favourite destination for a long drive or a dhaba dinner has similar unsafe openings in the divider all along the stretch from Kona Expressway to Kolaghat. Throw in lazy police personnel and loutish drivers into the mix and you have a highway where mishaps and near-misses occur every hour, if not every minute.        
	Metro drove down the Howrah stretch of National Highway 6 till Uluberia on Monday and discovered how danger stalks the traveller every few kilometres. Here are five peril points you should watch out for:         
	Howrah truck terminal, 15km from city        
	Trucks and cars headed towards the city regularly make use of an opening in the divider to reach the fuel pump on the right flank, coming in the way of vehicles speeding down the expressway. The intersection neither has a traffic light nor any policeman to enforce a semblance of road discipline.        
	Accidents occur every day but nobody has bothered sealing the breach in the divider or at least regulating traffic. I guess only a human tragedy like the one that we saw less than 50km from here on Sunday will shake up the authorities, said Dipak Das, a cook in a roadside dhaba.        
	Ankurhati More, 20km        
	The presence of pedestrians along with trucks trying to cross over makes this one of the more accident-prone areas along the highway. The opening in the divider is apparently to spare residents of the villages on either side of the road the trouble of exercising the safer but lengthier option of travelling a few kilometres to do a proper U-turn.         
	On Monday, the lone, lathi-wielding policeman doing duty at the crossing seemed scarcely bothered about trucks on the left flank getting to the right side and driving at least another 500 metres to stop at a fuel pump or an eatery.        
	Shop owner D. Mandal said it was a miracle that someone wasnt getting killed every day. Sundays mishap was a wake-up call but I suspect the fear will be gone in a day or two.        
	Jangalpur, 25km         
	This highway stop has turned into a township of sorts because of the Jalan Complex, where nearly 1,000 small industrial units operate, and assorted factories on either side of the road. Trucks flit in and out of these units day and night at the risk of colliding with speeding vehicles on both flanks.         
	The absence of a traffic signal or police personnel makes negotiating this stretch almost a game of Russian roulette. Sometimes you will see police vans parked on either side but they come not to keep an eye on traffic but for bribes, said tobacco-seller Amit Ansari.               
	Dhulagarh, 30km         
	A small opening in the divider barely 500 metres from the Dhulagarh toll plaza is the gateway to the Sankrail Industrial Park for hundreds of trucks, trailers and other heavy vehicles that bring raw materials and leave with finished goods.         
	The police are conspicuous by their absence here, too. I close my eyes whenever I see a heavy vehicle hurtle across the road to enter the industrial park, lest I see a fatal accident, said Sukumar Patra, a loom operator in a plastic factory.        
	Khalisani-Kalitala, 35km         
	The opening in the divider looks barely enough for a small car to pass through but trucks and trailers regularly use it to get to the other side, sometimes with the wheels going over a portion of the median divider. A traffic policeman mans the crossing on some days but only in name.         
	Food vendor Paresh Mandal saw a cop being injured a few days back when a mini truck that he had tried to stop knocked him down. Drivers rule the road. The only way out is to seal all the openings, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Duo clean chit to zoo staff
                                                                                                               Duo clean chit to zoo staff
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The alleged mastermind of the marmoset theft, Rajesh Singh, and his aide Raj Saikia have told police that zoo employees were not involved in the crime.        
	The police, however, are not yet ready to give a clean chit to the zoo employee and the two guards of a private agency arrested in connection with the August 8 theft.        
	Singh and Saikia have claimed that no zoo employee was involved in the theft. We want to examine the duo thoroughly to be sure that the arrested zoo employee and the guards are indeed innocent, said an officer of the detective department.        
	Ashoke Parui and guards Shyam Ghosh and Ashok Patra were arrested within 72 hours of the zoo authorities discovering on August 9 morning the net of the monkey cage cut open and the eight marmosets missing.        
	Paruis job was checking the condition of the nets of different cages and Ghosh and Patra were on duty the night the marmosets were stolen. The three are out on bail.        
	We had enough reasons to suspect them. But after the arrest of the kingpin, it appears that they did not have any role in the theft, said an officer probing the case.        
	On Thursday, a team from Orissa police reached the city to interrogate Singh and Saikia in connection with the theft of a pair of macaws from Nandankanan zoo in Orissa a few months ago.        
	We have evidence to prove that it was Singh who masterminded the theft of the macaws from Nandankanan. We informed our counterparts in Orissa, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters).        
	Cop teams from other states, including Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Gujarat, are also expected in the city soon to examine Singh and Saikia.        
	According to police, Vivian Solesman, the 72-year-old Pune resident from whom Singh allegedly took an advance of Rs 2 lakh to sell the marmosets, had links with wildlife racketeers in Bangladesh and Dubai.        
	We are trying to find out whether there are buyers of exotic birds and animals in Bangladesh or Vivian sent his consignments abroad through Bangladesh, said an officer.

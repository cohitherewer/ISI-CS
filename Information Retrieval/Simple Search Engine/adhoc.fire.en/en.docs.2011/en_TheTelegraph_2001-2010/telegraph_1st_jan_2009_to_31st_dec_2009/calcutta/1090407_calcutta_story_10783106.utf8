The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A rare treat for Ramsay   Ramsay gets a taste of street food
                                                                                                               A rare treat for Ramsay     - Celebrity chef digs into spicy but delicious alu dum          RASHBEHARI DAS AND MOHUA DAS                      Gordon Ramsay goes hunting for streetfood on Monday afternoon. Picture by Rashbehari Das                                
	The tall blond man seated on a bench in office para and tucking into alu dum and chappati with relish on Monday afternoon was not just another foreigner sampling the citys street food. He was Gordon Ramsay.        
	The most famous cook in the world  famous enough for a certain Paris Hilton to think the Prime Minister of Britain was named Gordon Ramsay (and not Brown)  was in town to get a taste of the city for a BBC Channel 4 shoot.        
	In a sky blue muscle tee shirt, khaki cargo pants and black and orange sneakers (custom-made size 15), chunky blue leather strap watch on hand and aviators (shades) in hand, he was stared at but not stopped. No one in the central business district of Calcutta seemed to recognise the celebrity restaurateur, also voted UKs sexiest chef.        
	Ramsay, 42, hit the crowded streetfood stretch outside Bankshall court  where makeshift stalls served up everything from biryani to bread toast  with a mission. A mission called Gordons Great Escape, billed to be his most exciting food adventure yet.                    
	Standing 6.2 feet tall, the Scottish-born chef out to discover a whole new culinary world  and probably get rid of a bad taste in the mouth left by some poor press back in London  seemed to follow his nose as he checked out what was cooking where on a bustling street of Calcutta.        
	He was soon joined by a local food guide  t2 columnist Nondon Bagchi. Both sauntered through the food trays and egg crates, starting from the south gate of Bankshall court.                                
	Ramsays curiosity got the better of him as he took the lid off a few large steel bins to find out what was being stirred up and sold at what cost.        
	First stop, camera in tow, was a sugarcane juice vending machine, where Nondon explained the working of the crusher and the vendor swiftly squeezed out a khullar of freshly squeezed juice for the special guest.        
	The man with 16 Michelin Stars  the definitive guide to restaurants of outstanding quality  then stopped at the chaat stall, his eye catching a large can brimming with dahi.        
	Finally, lunchtime. Two giant umbrellas were fixed overhead to beat the blazing April sun as Ramsay attacked alu dum and chappati.        
	The verdict from The F-Word man after half-and-hour of chat and chomp?        
	A bit spicy but delicious!

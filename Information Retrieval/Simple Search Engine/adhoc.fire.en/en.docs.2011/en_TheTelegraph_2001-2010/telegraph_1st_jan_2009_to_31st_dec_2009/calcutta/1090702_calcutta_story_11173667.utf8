The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sops for minorities after poll debacle
                                                                                                               Sops for minorities after poll debacle
          ZEESHAN JAWED                              
	The Left Front government has announced a slew of projects for minorities with an eye on the 2011 Assembly elections. The initiatives are aimed at wooing back minorities in the wake of the Lok Sabha poll debacle, sources said.        
	The Muslim community is feeling alienated from us. There is a perception that the Left government has not done anything for them in the last 32 years. We want to break that perception, said a CPM leader.         
	The first project is a paramedical college for Muslim women, to come up on 140 acres behind Lady Brabourne College that has been acquired by the minorities department for Rs 18 crore.         
	It will be a 10-storeyed building with state-of-the-art classrooms and a library. The students would receive practical training at National Medical College, said minority affairs and madarsa education minister Abdus Sattar.         
	The government hopes to inaugurate the college in January 2011, just before the elections. The college would also have a hostel that can accommodate at least 100 students, said Sattar.         
	The government has decided to build another hostel for Muslim girls at a cost of Rs 6 crore on Dilkhusha Street. It will accommodate 60 students.         
	Another project in the pipeline is a credit scheme for Muslim women to start small businesses. The government is planning to roll out the scheme in all the districts by the year-end. Three per cent interest would be charged on the loans. In special cases, the interest might be waived, said Sattar.         
	The minorities department is also fast-tracking projects announced earlier. Sattar said the proposed Haj Tower, whose foundation stone was laid by the chief minister three years ago, would be completed by 2010.         
	But many in the department are sceptical about how many projects will see the light of day. The minister doesnt have much support within the party. There are also differences among the Muslim leaders, said a CPM source.

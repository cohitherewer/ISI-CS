The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Womans body on canal bank
                                                                                                               Womans body on canal bank
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The spot where the body was found in a trunk. (Amit Datta)                                  
	The body of a woman in her mid-20s, whose wrists and throat were slit, was found in a trunk on the bank of Circular Canal in Narkeldanga early on Sunday.        
	The woman, yet to be identified, was dressed in red and black kurta. Police said she had been murdered at least 18 to 20 hours before being dumped near a railway underpass off Canal East Road.        
	Judging by the condition of the body it seems the killer had kept it in an air-conditioned room. He probably bought a trunk, stuffed the body into it and transported it to Narkeldanga in the boot of a car, said an investigator.        
	The place where the body was dumped is secluded. There are no residential buildings in the neighbourhood, only godowns and small factories. So there is hardly anyone in the area at night. The killer took advantage of it, said an officer of Narkeldanga police station.        
	Passers-by spotted the trunk and alerted the police. Rajesh Singh, who runs a makeshift eatery nearby, said a crowd had gathered at the spot by the time he opened his shop at 7am on Sunday.        
	The policemen opened the trunk and laid the body on the side of the road so that it might be identified. Since there are no residential buildings on the road, the crowd comprised mostly pedestrians all of whom told the officers that they hadnt seen her before, said Singh.        
	Jawed Shamim, the city detective chief, said: None of the residents of the shanty within 1km of the spot could recognise the woman. Anyway, she does not look like a shanty dweller.

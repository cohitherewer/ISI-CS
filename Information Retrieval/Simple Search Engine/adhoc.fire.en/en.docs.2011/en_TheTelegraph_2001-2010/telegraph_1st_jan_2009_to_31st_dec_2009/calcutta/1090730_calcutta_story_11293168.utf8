The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hilsa haul raises hope of price cut
                                                                                                               Hilsa haul raises hope of price cut

	The monsoon romance with hilsa will be easier on the pocket from next week, according to wholesalers.         
	The price of large hilsa will drop to Rs 250-300 per kg within 10 days, said sellers at the Howrah, Sealdah, Patipukur and Serampore fish markets on Wednesday.        
	Increased supply from Kolaghat and Diamond Harbour from Monday is likely to bring down the price of the monsoon harvest.        
	Despite large hauls at the Mumbai and Digha coasts and import from Bangladesh, the delicacy has remained out of reach for many families because of the price tag of Rs 400-500 per kg for the large variety.        
	Hilsa weighing up to 800 grams, mostly sourced from Digha and Kolaghat, is retailing at Rs 300-350 per kg.         
	As the sea has become choppy, more and more shoals of hilsa are entering the rivers, resulting in larger hauls at Digha, Kolaghat and Diamond Harbour, said Sheikh Alam of the Howrah fish market.        
	On an average, 25,000 tonnes of hilsa are caught every year in these places. Many, however, consider hilsa from the Hooghly and the Padma to be superior to the Digha or Kolaghat variety.        
	According to Sukanta Das of the Serampore fish market, most of the hilsa being sold as the Bangladesh variety is from Mumbai.        
	The hilsa is transported from Mumbai in packets instead of traditional baskets. In order to preserve the fish and to make it look fresh, chemicals are added to the packets. This type of hilsa is not very tasty, he added.

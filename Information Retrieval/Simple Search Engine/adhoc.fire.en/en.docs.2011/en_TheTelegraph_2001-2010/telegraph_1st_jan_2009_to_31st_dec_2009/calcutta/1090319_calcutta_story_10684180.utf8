                      Snapshots of Indian culture                    Having shared a close, personal association with Rabindranath Tagore, Frenchman Alain Danilou and Raymond Burnier of Switzerland developed a great love and interest for Indian tradition and culture. After retiring as director from Tagores school of music at Santiniketan, Danilou went to Benares and lived there in a mansion (Rewa Kothi) on the banks of the Ganga. He stayed there for 15 years and studied Indian classical music from Shivendranath Basu, from whom he learnt to play the veena like any professional. He also studied Hindi, Sanskrit and philosophy from masters who were among the highest authorities of tradition. Greatly interested in the symbolism of Hindu architecture and sculpture, he made long trips together with Raymond Burnier to Khajuraho, Bhubaneswar and Konarak, as well as to many lesser-known sites in central India and Rajasthan. His infinite curiosity and fascination about Indias arts, philosophy and religion helped him discover the mystical East and make continuous and significant contributions to Indias cultural heritage. Lights of the Ganga, the ongoing photography exhibition, chronicles Danilou and Burniers travels and experiences within Indias traditional society and is curated by Dr Samiuel Berthet. Hosted by Indian Council for Cultural Relations.                  Event: An exhibition of photographs by Alain Danilou and Raymond Burnier When: Till March 20; 11 am - 7 pm Where: Abanindranath Tagore Gallery, Rabindranath Tagore Centre, Indian Council for Cultural Relations, 9A, Ho Chi Minh Sarani

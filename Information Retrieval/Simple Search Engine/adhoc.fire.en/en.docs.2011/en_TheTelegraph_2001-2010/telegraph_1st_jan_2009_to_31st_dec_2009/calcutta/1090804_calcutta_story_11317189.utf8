The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Safety clearance for Metro extension
                                                                                                               Safety clearance for Metro extension

	Metro Railway has received safety clearance for trains to ply between Tollygunge and Birji. Railway minister Mamata Banerjee is scheduled to inaugurate operations on the extended route on August 23.        
	The office of the commissioner of railway safety (CRS) has given the formal clearance to the project. There are no other technical issues pending, said a senior Metro Railway official on Monday.        
	We are ready for the inauguration. Finishing touches are needed at the stations. The work will be completed well in advance, said another official.        
	The CRS office inspected the 6km Tollygunge-Birji route last Tuesday. The clearance was granted on Friday. Nod from the CRS office is mandatory for commercial train operations on any route.        
	The extension will take Metro to Garia but stop 2.5km short of the terminal station at New Garia.        
	It is difficult to say when the entire stretch will be operational since land acquisition is involved, said an official.         
	Trains would take around 15 minutes to cover the extended stretch. Prior to the CRS inspection, Metro had conducted a series of trial runs from May 28 to July 25.        
	New rakes are also on the cards. The first state-of-the-art rake would roll out of a Tamil Nadu factory in October. In a years time, the magnetic tickets will be replaced with smart coupons, which are more user-friendly, said an official.

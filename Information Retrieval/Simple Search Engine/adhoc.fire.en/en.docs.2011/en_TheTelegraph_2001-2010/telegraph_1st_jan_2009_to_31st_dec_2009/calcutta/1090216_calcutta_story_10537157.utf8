                                                                                                               Press amp; the city over centuries 
  - Exhibition at ICCR on printing and book production          A STAFF REPORTER                          Visitors study exhibits at Printing and Book Production in Bengal. Picture by Pradip Sanyal                                        
	Photographs began to be taken in India around the same time the technology was invented in 19th Century France. However, it had taken about three centuries since the invention of printing by the German goldsmith, Johan Guetenberg, for the first printing press to be set up in Calcutta in 1777 by the maverick, James Augustus Hicky.         
	The city had been at the epicentre of the intellectual upheaval that led to the spread of learning and the triumph of the printed word, which, of course, would not have been possible without the press.        
	The exhibition, Printing and Book Production in Bengal, which was opened at the Rabindranath Tagore Centre of the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) by Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi on Saturday evening, takes viewers on a journey of the progress of printing technology and its application down the decades through viewer-friendly charts and illustrations, and the display of some very old printing presses.        
	The oldest of these, dating back to 1869, is a hand press manufactured by Hopkins amp; Co and used by P.M. Bagchi amp; Co that still publishes almanacs.        
	This, however, is not an exposition on either printing technology or book design, and so only books that had made a technological breakthrough have been included. While the title-page from K.K. Chatterjees Syphilis in General Practice is there as it was part of the nationalist enterprise of early 20th Century and indigenous scientific research, Sahajpath is not, however striking its design.                            
	Research on the exhibition (to continue at the Ho Chi Minh Sarani centre till February 21), presented by the School of Cultural Texts and Records, Jadavpur University, began almost a year ago by Swapan Chakaravorty, who was assisted by Aritra Chakraborti, Hrileena Ghosh and Meghdut Rudra. The easy-to-follow layout was conceived by Sukanya Ghosh.               
	Sukanta Chaudhuri, the director of the School, said it was an exhibition of great value. Chakaravorty added that the School was interested in printing technology, the stress being on book production. The long-term plan was to set up a museum in the old mint on Strand Road. The exhibition is meant to make us aware of what we have got and what we are throwing away, he said.               
	The Russian, Gerasim Steppanovich Lebedeff, whose adaptations of Moliere and Jodrelle were the earliest plays in Bengali to be staged in Calcutta, was said to have founded a press in the city. Patronised by the Czar, Bengali books were printed here but the playwright was bankrupt and was thrown out of the country. The founding of the governments own press and the other printing presses that came up in the White Town turned Calcutta into the hub of printing not only in English but in vernaculars as well. The exhibition gives viewers some idea of the richness and the diversity of the material published.               
	Relatively sophisticated technology was used to print maps and illustrations and well-known artists like Daniell and Upjohn did prints and engravings. The accompanying photographs of actual maps and illustrations, some that have become iconic images, and pages from books brought this complex history alive.               
	The early days of the printing of Bengali characters and the origin of Bengali types designed by Charles Wilkins, aided by Panchanan Karmakar, were similarly traced through portraits and title-pages of actual books.               
	Tracked down till recent times, the history is divided into 10 sections like Mission Press and Fort William College, Battala, Learned Printers and Scholarly Publishing, Educational Texts and College Street, Technical Innovations and the Periodical Press, Literature and Print Culture: Rabindranath Tagore and Printing in the Sylhet Nagri script. Some naughty asides and illustrations have leavened what could have become an exercise in pedantry.               
	The opening was marred by the poor acoustics in the foyer of the exhibition space. None of the speakers could be heard.

                      Beyond the form, a riot of colours                          When the creative urge in an artist transforms into his creations, they are truly splendid and original works and become what Daniel Barenboim says, every great work of art has two faces, one toward its own time and one toward the future, toward eternity. Both Bhaskar Lahiri and Manas Biswas have been prolific artists and have been participating in exhibitions regularly despite their personal and professional commitments. Biswas enjoys working with watercolour and his use of bright, vibrant colours creates a dramatic effect. Lahiri, on the other hand, is fascinated by mythology and the various connotations of the mudras that are associated with Indian gods and goddesses, specially Kali. His depiction of the various moods of the Goddess and Her kundalini shakti are recreated graphically in dark, contrasting colours.                    Event: Exhibition of paintings by Bhaskar Lahiri and Manas Biswas When: Till October 21; 3 pm - 8 pm Where: Academy of Fine Arts

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The National Commission for Minorities has summoned the Jadavpur University (JU) vice-chancellor to Delhi to explain why a Muslim applicant was not appointed as a lecturer in the geology department last year.        
	The applicant, Babar Ali Shah, who is a research scholar at the university, had lodged a complaint with the commission in October claiming that he was more qualified than the candidate chosen for the post.        
	The commission, which safeguards the rights of minorities, wrote to vice-chancellor P.N. Ghosh that his responses to its queries were unsatisfactory and directed him to appear before a bench on June 25 with all relevant documents.         
	Ghosh denied Shahs allegation and stressed that appointments were made only on the basis of merit.        
	A representative of the university will attend the commissions hearing in Delhi, said the vice-chancellor.

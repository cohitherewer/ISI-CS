The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Guest house of friendly spirits 
                                                                                                               Free radical      Guest house of friendly spirits 
										                                    
	At the dead of a sultry night in May, as I was trying to tire myself to sleep by wiggling my toes constantly, I thought I saw a face at the window. My sleep-starved brain told me that it was the local grocer, whose face, incidentally, I have never seen because he always remains perched on a ladder with his head among the cartons on the mezzanine floor. Whatever it might have been, the vision wiped out the last vestiges of sleep from my eyes, and in the burning clarity of wakefulness it became apparent that I needed a break.        
	Two days of anxious planning followed that involved haggling with my senior for leave, buying a new toothbrush and a ticket for Darjeeling. And then Aila struck, destroying my plans. But for once the extremity of the resultant despair spurred me on to action. I shoved some clothes into my jhola, tucked two volumes of Lila Majumdars complete works under my arms, and booked myself for three days at a guest house adjacent to the Ballygunge railway station. The guest house was a five-minute walk from my home in Jamir Lane.         
	Once lodged in the hotel room, I discovered heaven. For one, the room was air-conditioned, and so what if Kanchenjungha was not there sheltered from the heat outside, propped up with Batashbari and Gupir Guptokhata, I was in my very own Darjeeling. And then there were the trains that kept coming and going all through the day well into the night. They might have been just electric trains but for me they sang tong ling, tong ling, tong ling, and I felt their presence in the tremor beneath the feet.         
	From the height of the balcony, I rediscovered the bazaar where I shop every day. I observed intently the bespectacled man who sells achar and surmised that he has a newspaper fetish. He reads all the Bengali dailies, puts them on his head when the sun becomes unbearable, and stares belligerently from between their pages when customers approach. And having watched the office-going babus who commute by local trains, I have concluded that they chomp on all kinds of junk food at the station before settling for the boring, homemade fare awaiting them.         
	But the most fascinating characters at the station are the fishwives and women working as domestic help who descend in a gang in the morning and depart at the days end. These women never walk but run, speak a language enriched with the choicest cusswords, and share a camaraderie that made me quite envious. The fishwives also contribute considerably to the characteristic smell of the station  a mix of the fishy, sweaty, shitty with the sharp odour of chillis and the morbid fragrance of tuberoses.         
	My maid had warned me that the spirits of people who have died on the tracks roam the station at night. In my last night at the guest house, I saw one. By that time, after two days sans anxiety, I was sleeping regularly without the routine toe-wiggling. As I was nodding off in the balcony, I saw a lovely old woman, at least a hundred years old, sitting content on the steps of the overbridge, chewing paan and swatting mosquitoes. I could almost smell the jorda on her breath and was reminded of my grandmother, who had a partiality for Baba jorda. Then the last train hooted into the station and as a few tired passengers rushed up the stairs, the lady evaporated before my eyes. I slept well that night and dreamt of my long-dead pet cat, Giribala.       ANUSUA MUKHERJEE

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Theatre thrill for children

	On the concluding day of theatre group Sayaks 10-day camp held in June at Minerva theatre, the participants (aged six to 14) seemed as joyous as the singers of Sukumar Rays Abol Tabol who, undaunted by the adversity and pandemonium of daily living, sing Daarey daarey drum, dere dere dere.         
	The evening began with some lusty singing. An original song written and scored by the children with the help of music designer Murari Roychowdhury, was followed by song versions of the Abol Tabol limericks.         
	Roychowdhury was one of the faculties Sayak had got together for the camp, sponsored by the ministry of women and child development. There was no entry fee. Many more children turned up than the 35 we could accommodate. We hope to do this every year, said director Meghnad Bhattacharya, who heads Sayak.         
	The camp director was Maloy Mitra and supervisor Bivas Chakraborty.        
	Among those who guided the children was Manoj Mitra. In his acting classes, he made children deliver the same dialogue in different ways and discover the different meanings each conveyed. It was an eye-opener for us too, said Bhattacharya.         
	Suresh Duttas classes on puppetry and puppet-making were a hit with the kids too.         
	Gadhar Gaan/gyan, scripted by Debashish Majumdar with the help of children (during his script-writing classes) was a well-enacted narrative about a poor and timid washerman and his intelligent donkey. Masks and trees made of paper, sponge and cloth were used in the play.        
	Given a boon by the goddess of fortune that whatever he says would come true, the washerman finds he is in deeper trouble than before. His greedy family makes life miserable for him and even his donkey cant save him. He wants to return the gift of the magic tongue, but his selfish wife does not let him.         
	The training by Niranjan Goswami in mime, Kabir Sen Barat in dance, Bijoylakshmi Burman in recitation and Ashok Pramanik in light showed in the performance of the kids, especially in the play Alor Pothey, written by youngsters Suparno and Subhamita. It touched on the bonds between generations and friends.         
	But in the end, the biggest prize for Rwithom, Rishita, and Chandrika was friends. All were miserable at the thought of losing touch with their new friends and teachers. We dont have a place to play near our house, this was like a dream home, said one 11-year old.         
	 Sebanti Sarkar                              EIGHT FOR THE BARD: Students and the director (extreme right) perform at the attestation ceremony of Alliance Francaise du Bengale at Calcutta School of Music
            Tagore tunes sung in French
    
	Rabindrasangeet in French? Thats what one got to hear at Calcutta School of Music on a June Sunday. The occasion was the attestation ceremony of Alliance Francaise du Bengale.   
	The evening got off the block with the familiar Ami chini go chini, translated into the not-so-familiar Je te connais parfaitement. Joining the seven on song was the affable Alliance Francaise director Alexandre Martinez, in his fifth month in the city.         
	It was fun singing Tagore in French. Our director has a nice voice, said Swati Roychowdhury, a member of the group, who also picked up a prize for getting 98 per cent in class tests.         
	If Tagore got a French treatment, so did singer Hemanta Mukherjee. Ei meghla diney ekla from the Uttam Kumar-starrer Shesh Porjonto became Jour en nuage, tout isole.         
	Though certificates were given out by the dozen, a special round of applause was reserved for Krithika Govindarajan. The 18-year-old who scored a perfect 100 in the French proficiency test received a promise of being sent to Paris next year by Nusrat Hussain of CampusFrance.         
	I had taken up French in school as the easiest option available to bypass sewing and art and craft, admitted Krithika in fluent French. The Class XII student of GD Birla Girls High School, who has completed post-diploma higher studies in the language, has Tamil as her mother-tongue. What about Bengali? Ektu boli, beshi boli na, she grinned.        
	It wasnt only Bengali-to-French that was the musical tenor of the evening. Monami Basu sang Celine Dions My heart will go on before handing over the mike to Madhuchhanda Dutta and Anasuya Ghosh for a French rendition.         
	On stumbling over an Indian name, the announcer muttered: Ive become stupidly British. One cant get more French than that.

	Wipro launched Mission 10X, a faculty training programme in West Bengal on July 1, in three engineering colleges Heritage Institute of Technology, Jadavpur University and Bengal Engineering and Science University.         
	This venture will bring teachers up to date with new methods of teaching and help them make students industry-ready, said Clayton Moses, the student adviser of The Heritage. The initiative that will commence on August 14, has been started in five states.            
	Annual day        
	Ballygunge Shiksha Sadan celebrated its annual function and prize distribution ceremony on June 23 at the Kala Mandir auditorium.         
	Subir Kumar Dhar, the head of the department of English of Rabindra Bharati University, was one of the guests. N. Vincent was given a special felicitation for her contribution to the school for 55 years. The students put up William Shakespeares Julius Caesar. The play portrayed how the common people had allowed themselves to become pawns of unscrupulous people in power.         
	 Vasundhara Josh                      The winners of the TTIS Suthol Super Cool Mom Kaun contest
              
	My mom the best, cheers tot brigade               
	If you are used to your mother cheering you from the sidelines in a contest, you would have been surprised to attend this one. Held on June 28 at EZCC, Salt Lake, TTIS Suthol Super Cool Mom Kaun had 150 moms proving whose maternal instincts were the strongest.         
	First up was a selection round, carried out on the basis of recipes sent by the participants, along with a short write-up by the children on why they considered their mothers cool.         
	Preparing something new every other day for my son Sukrits tiffin is a perennial worry. If he doesnt like it, he just throws it away. My tiranga sandwich, made in different colours, with cheese and green lettuce, is his favourite, said Monalisa Chandra.         
	The 40 moms shortlisted in this round then faced a general knowledge quiz. This was followed by a time management session, where child and mother teamed up to collect coloured beads and make a necklace, all in one minute.         
	Sambrita Barua, the winner of the Three Minutes to Fame contest in last years The Great TTIS Challenge, performed to an eastern folk number to keep the fun going. A lucky draw for all participants on the sidelines of the contest offered six winners a voucher for a two-night-three-day stay at a Club Mahindra resort.        
	A quiz session that cut the list of 40 participants to 20 was followed by a fitness round where moms and children participated in a hurdle race with props. The last three rounds, judged by actors Saheb Chatterjee, Mithu Chakraborty, Piu Sarkar, and psychologist Malavika Desai, tested the 10 finalists on their ability to handle uncomfortable questions from their children with a sense of humour. Chandras 12-year-old son asked: You say that studies are vital for me. But dont poor people have as much right to educate themselves?        
	Chandra, Purba Roy and Puloma Sen emerged the winners. They won a two-night-three-day tour package from Club Mahindra, along with gift vouchers.        
	Im very proud of my mother, said Archana Sen of Class V, the daughter of second runner-up Puloma. She manages her career as a classical dancer and has her own dance school, but always has enough time to take care of me.

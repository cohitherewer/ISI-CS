The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Parking fee at Book Fair
                                                                                                               Parking fee at Book Fair
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Visitors to the Book Fair will have to fork out a fee for parking their vehicles this year.         
	The civic authorities and the fair organisers have earmarked around 8.5 acres behind the Milon Mela ground, where the Book Fair will be held between January 27 and February 8, for parking of nearly 700 cars. The authorities have decided to charge a parking fee.         
	Car owners will have to pay Rs 10 per hour. Those manning the lot will collect the fee and also scan the vehicles for security reasons.         
	The city police asked us to identify a space where visitors to the Book Fair could park their cars. This was necessary to ensure better traffic management on the arterial roads near the fair venue, said Alapan Bandyopadhayay, the municipal commissioner.        
	The issue of parking was discussed at Thursdays meeting between the chief secretary, the police brass and members of other government departments.         
	With senior officers of the city police and their counterparts from South 24-Parganas demanding a designated car park to avoid a traffic mess on the Park Circus connector and EM Bypass, it was decided that five acres belonging to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation would be used for parking along with 3.5 acres belonging to the Calcutta Stock Exchange.         
	We have decided that those arriving in cars would not be allowed to get off midway. They would have to drive to the parking lot and enter the fair through designated entry gates, said Ranvir Kumar, the joint commissioner of Calcutta police (traffic).         
	The parking lot will be manned by a co-operative society, which will be selected by floating a tender.

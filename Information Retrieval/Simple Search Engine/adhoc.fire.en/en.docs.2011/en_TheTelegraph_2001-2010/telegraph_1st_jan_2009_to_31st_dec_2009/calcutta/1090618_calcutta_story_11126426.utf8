The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Web window for admission
                                                                                                               Web window for admission
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The state information technology department on Tuesday claimed to have developed a software that would allow students to apply to multiple colleges through a website.        
	Physical distribution and submission of forms lead to complications that can be avoided using this software, IT minister Debesh Das said at a programme to celebrate the launch of the software on the Vidyasagar College website.        
	The college is accepting online applications from students with the help of the software. Next year, more colleges are expected to join Vidyasagar on a common platform featuring the tech tool.        
	We want to create a website with the admission criteria of all colleges. It would allow students to apply to courses of their choice in their preferred colleges, added Das.         
	According to the minister, a student will have to enter his/her name, roll number and marks just once on the website. The department will process the data on the basis of admission criteria and send them to the colleges concerned.        
	If a student wishes to change the online submission, he or she can log on to the site and make modifications, said Das. Such a platform can make the admission process hassle-free. But the success of the project depends on its execution. Given the track record of the department, one should keep fingers crossed till the portal is online, said a professor of a reputable college.

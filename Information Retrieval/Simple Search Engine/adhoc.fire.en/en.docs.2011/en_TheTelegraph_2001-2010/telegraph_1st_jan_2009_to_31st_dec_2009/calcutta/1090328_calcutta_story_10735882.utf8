The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Ladder man in kid rescue act
                                                                                                               Ladder man in kid rescue act
          A STAFF REPORTER                           Jahar Pandit. (Amit Datta)                                  
	Jahar Pandit is no Akshay Kumar. But on Friday evening the way he conquered the fear factor and rescued seven children from atop a building on Bentinck Street would have made the Bollywood braveheart proud.        
	The sattu seller in his early-30s responded to the cries of the kids trapped on the terrace of 66 Bentinck Street where a fire had broken out on Friday evening by carrying them over a metal ladder to the safety of the adjoining terrace.        
	The fire broke out around 7pm in a godown on the terrace of the two-storeyed building. Four fire tenders doused the flames while a team of firemen and local residents evacuated residents through the stairway. But seven kids remained trapped on the terrace till Jahar got into the act.        
	A ladder was placed to bridge the gap between two terraces and Jahar clambered across to bring back the children, one at a time. Neither the fear of a 30-ft fall from the ladder nor the threat of the fire spreading could slow the tall man down.        
	I told myself I had to remain calm and rescue all the children. I told them to hold on to me and not look down, said Jahar, also known as Nanak.        
	Once the deed was done, the braveheart from Bihar allowed himself a breather  and a glass of water.

	A nano technology-based solar cell development centre is coming up in the city with the aim to make solar power more affordable.        
	The centre is being set up by the West Bengal Green Energy Development Corporation Limited in association with the Washington DC-based Catholic University. Calcutta University (CU) and the state science and technology council will also be involved in the project. The centre is expected to start functioning from November 2009.        
	Once the new technology hits the market, a home light set (two lights and one ceiling fan) that comes for Rs 10,000 is expected to cost Rs 6,000. Similarly, an entire solar set-up of three lights, two fans, one air-conditioner and one TV, which costs Rs 120,000 now, will be available for Rs 65,000.        
	The director of the corporation, S.P. Gonchowdhury, said the project would cost Rs 8 crore, which would come from the state and central governments and the US university. Last month, an MoU was signed between the Indian partners and the US university.        
	Gonchowdhury said the centre would come up on CUs Salt Lake campus. Six scientists would go to Catholic University for training and the expenses would be borne by the US institute. On their return, the scientists would train other researchers.         
	He also said the centre would try to tie up with industries for production of solar cells using the new technology. With increase in production, it is expected that the price of solar cells will come down by half and more people will be benefited. The target is to reach solar power to every household and help reduce electricity bills, he added.

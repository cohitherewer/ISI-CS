The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fresh marksheet after varsity mistake
                                                                                                               Fresh marksheet after varsity mistake
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Friday ordered Calcutta University to issue a fresh marksheet to a law student after her marks increased in a review of a supplementary paper, conducted by mistake.         
	Subhra Seal, who completed the five-year LlB course from a college affiliated to the university this year, was not satisfied with her marks in a supplementary subject (mandatory subjects that must be studied along with the honours subject) in the final examination.        
	Subhra had approached the Calcutta University for a review of the answer script of the subject. The university authorities asked her to deposit an amount for the review.         
	After she did so, the review was conducted. When Subhra approached the authorities to find out the outcome of the review, she was told her marks had increased and but as there was no provision in the university rules for a review of supplementary papers, a fresh marksheet would not be issued.         
	After approaching several university officials for getting a fresh marksheet issued, Subhra had moved a writ petition in the high court. The plea came up for hearing before Justice Dipankar Dutta on Friday.        
	The judge asked the Calcutta University lawyer why his client had taken money to review the paper when there was no provision to do so.        
	The university lawyer informed the court that his client had taken the amount by mistake.        
	Not satisfied with the response, the judge directed the university authorities to issue a fresh marksheet to the student showing the revised marks she had obtained in the supplementary paper.

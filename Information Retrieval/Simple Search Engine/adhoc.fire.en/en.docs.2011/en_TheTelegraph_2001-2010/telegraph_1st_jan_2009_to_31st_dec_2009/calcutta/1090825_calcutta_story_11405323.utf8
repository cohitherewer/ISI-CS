The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | UK pilot recounts axe chase   Shelter in Vedic Village bathroom 
                                                                                                               UK pilot recounts axe chase 
  Shelter in Vedic Village bathroom           KARO CHRISTINE KUMAR                                                  
	On Monday afternoon, Vedic Village wore a deserted look. There were barely five families on the sprawling resort braving the aftermath of Sunday evenings arson that left vital parts of the resort gutted.         
	Metro tracked down one of the guests, a British pilot, who refused to be photographed but agreed to relive the horror that had unfolded at the idyllic hospitality address the previous evening.        
	This is what Mark, 25, suffered on Sunday:        
	I was sitting with my friends Amaya and Michelle, having a drink at the bar, when we heard loud voices and saw a large crowd of people marching into the club house, with shovels and sticks.        
	One of the men, with an axe in his hand, began to chase me. Amaya and I ran towards the bathroom, locked the door, switched off the lights and hid there in silence.        
	We heard the shouting for a long time. After a while Amaya slipped out but I was too scared to move. I sat there messaging Michelle from my cellphone. She had managed to return to her Lake Villa.        
	It was red hot and I thought it was just the heat, until I heard voices shouting Fire! Fire!. I was scared.        
	I ran out through the kitchen where some more men started to chase me, but I managed to escape.... I later informed the British embassy who helped shift Amaya, me and some other British guests to Hyatt Regency. I returned here this morning.        
	I dont know whether I want to continue staying at Vedic Village. I was here because it was a resort, but after what happened on Sunday, it is not one anymore.        
	Metro spotted some Vedic Village employees with injury marks on their hands and legs, suffered while jumping off 10 to 20 feet high walls in desperation to escape the mob.        
	And there were a few farmhouse and villa owners who arrived at the spa-resort the morning after to check if their prized property was safe.        
	We have been staying here for the past few months, but had to leave last night because of the fire. This morning we were back. We have to be here for the resort in good times and bad, said Sandeep Shah, who along with wife Bhawna and their nine-year-old daughter, was among the last to leave on Sunday and the first to return on Monday.

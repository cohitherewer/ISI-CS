The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Nine more flu positive 
                                                                                                               Nine more flu positive 
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Eight persons in the city and one in Midnapore East tested positive for swine flu on Tuesday.        
	The gradual spread of the disease has prompted the state government to request the railway ministry to set up isolation wards at two of its hospitals in the city.         
	The government also decided to open more isolation wards at state-run hospitals. Now, such wards are functioning at Infectious Diseases Hospital in Beleghata and MR Bangur Hospital.        
	Among those who tested positive in the city was 10-year old Dolon Saha, who has been admitted to the Beleghata hospital. Abhishek Kumar, of Tamluk in Midnapore East, has been admitted to Tamluk Sub-divisional Hospital.        
	A 53-year-old resident of Diamond Harbour, Balasubramanium Govindrajan, was admitted to Infectious Diseases Hospital after he was found to be suffering from swine flu symptoms on his return from Singapore on Monday night.        
	Tapas Sen, the nodal officer for swine flu in the state, said: We will request the railway ministry to set up isolation units at BR Singh and Garden Reach hospitals. The government will also ask the ministry to set up flu screening booths at Howrah and Sealdah stations.        
	It is not possible to screen all passengers arriving at the two stations. But at least those arriving from Mumbai and Pune should be screened, chief secretary Ashok Mohan Chakrabarti said.         
	Officials said isolation wards would be set up at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, Command Hospital in Alipore and ESI Hospital in Maniktala. Such units have also been set up in district and sub-divisional hospitals.        
	The chief secretary urged the people not to panic and said there was no need to shut down schools, malls and cinemas as a preventive measure. There are some sporadic cases of swine flu in the state. Most victims have recovered and returned home, he said.        
	The government has also decided to send a proposal to the centre to allow private laboratories to conduct the swine flu test.        
	Last week, the government had asked some private hospitals whether they wanted to set up isolation wards for swine flu patients. There has been no response yet from the hospitals.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rap on rule-flout Kali puja pandal
                                                                                                               Rap on rule-flout Kali puja pandal
          A STAFF REPORTER                           The Naba Yubak Sangha pandal                                  
	Police on Monday issued a notice to Naba Yubak Sangha, popularly known as Fatakeshtos puja, asking it to alter its Kali puja pandal to abide by the high court-approved norms. The pandal was one of the five the cops inspected in north Calcutta on Sunday.         
	Naba Yubak Sangha has not left the mandatory 4ft space on all sides, which we pointed out during our inspection, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters).        
	The organisers, however, said they had not received any written order from the police. We have not received any verbal communication from the police since Sunday either, said Prabandha Ray, the president of the puja committee.         
	A senior officer told Metro that not receiving the notice would not exempt the puja from police action since the high court norms in this regard were clear.         
	According to an estimate, over 2,000 community Kali pujas are held in the city. The police have promised tough screening and stern action  revoking puja permission  this year.         
	Organisers also have to leave a portion of the road free for movement of fire tenders. The space to be left free will depend on the width of the road.         
	Naba Yubak Sangha members, along with representatives of other puja committees, attended a briefing on pandal norms at Amherst Street police station on Monday evening.         
	At the meeting, the police said leaving 4ft free on all sides of the pandal was mandatory and they wouldnt show leniency towards any puja that flouted the court-approved norm, said Dhananjay Dhar, a member of the Naba Yubak Sanghapuja committee.        
	We have issued pamphlets from the 48 police stations mentioning the norms to be followed. We will also hold a meeting with organisers on October 10, said Shamim.         
	The police will carry out more inspections by the end of the week, he said. The number of Kali pujas may be more than Durga pujas but the scale of arrangement is lower. Most pujas have not yet started erecting pandals. Most of the well-known pujas are in Chetla and the Amherst Street area, added Shamim.

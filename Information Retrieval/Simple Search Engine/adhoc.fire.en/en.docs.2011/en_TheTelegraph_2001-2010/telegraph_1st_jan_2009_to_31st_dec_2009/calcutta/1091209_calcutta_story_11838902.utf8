The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pool cars: two steps back for one forward
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Pool cars: two steps back for one forward
          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	Any vehicle below six-seater cannot be used as a pool car for schoolchildren and Maruti Omnis are out despite seating eight, according to guidelines proposed and opposed at yet another inconclusive meeting between the government and operators.        
	The guidelines, tabled on Tuesday at the fourth meeting in a fortnight between two sides that have dilly-dallied on regulating the pool car business for years, were opposed by the operators on the ground that the main issues were yet to be resolved.        
	We are keen to find a permanent solution to the problem of pool cars operating without licences but the government hasnt worked out even the permit fees, Abir Roy, the secretary of the Pool Car Owners Welfare Association, told Metro.        
	The tax proposal that has been handed to us is very complicated. We cant make out anything, he alleged.        
	So is it status quo again on the licensed pool-car sham?        
	We will meet again on December 14 to finalise the tax structure for pool car operators, said an official of the transport department.        
	The official admitted that pool-car safety, or the lack of it, was cause for concern but said the process of regulating the business was stuck over issues like taxes and permit fees.        
	The tax and fee structure is being worked out and will be finalised after taking into account the observations of the pool car operators. We have given the operators some time to get back to us. We have also given them a sample of the logo that is to be used on all such vehicles, said Ujjal Sengupta, the secretary of the Regional Transport Authority.         
	A pool car owner said he and other operators had hoped the transport department would arrange for the logos instead of just handing out a sample.        
	The city has around 4,000 pool cars, most of them ferrying children to and from school every day without adhering to any norms. The transport department had drawn up and then dumped a set of guidelines in 2007, following the death of schoolboy Kaustav Bhattacharya in a pool car crash on VIP Road in July that year.        
	Since then, a lobby opposed to the proposal to issue licences only to vehicles registered from 2001 onwards has called the shots.        
	This time, we have decided that no car registered before 2000 will be allowed to ply. The operators need to apply for a replacement scheme before seeking permits, said an official.         
	Operators argued that the government first needed to publish an advertisement inviting applications.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      D-I-Y mothers step   in for missing cops

	Four mothers worried about their childrens safety on Calcuttas killer streets have taken to managing traffic at a busy unmanned crossing on VIP Road, showing Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees police force how to do it.        
	Aruna Banerjee, 42, was too busy with my own life until the day her elder son Ayan  a student of Class XII  was hit by an auto at the VIP Road entrance to Bangur. Her neighbour Saswati Nath, 54, was no different till one of her daughters narrated how she had fallen while getting off a bus after a rogue auto blocked her path.        
	Something told us we must do what we expect others to do. So here we are trying to make a small difference, smiled Aruna, standing on VIP Road on Thursday morning with a stick in her hand.        
	Aruna and Saswatis partners-in-traffic management are 57-year-old Sulekha Ghosh and 45-year-old Rita Roy, all residents of Block C of Bangur Avenue. Kalyani Mukherjee has also offered to join the D-I-Y (do it yourself) team.        
	The quartet, whose campaign went on the road on Wednesday, have decided to (wo)man the busy intersection for four hours every day  from 9 to 11am and 5 to 7pm. They have pooled in Rs 4,000 to create a fund from which they will pay two helpers  rickshaw-pullers Bapi Mondal and Chhotu Das  Rs 100 each per day for standing in whenever they are unable to do what the cops should be doing in the first place.        
	Surprised by the activism of the four women, police officers played the we-are-short-of-manpower card. An officer of the Lake Town traffic guard said 11 cops  against a sanctioned strength of 36  were being forced to man six crossings, four on VIP Road and two on Jessore Road.        
	A yellow board with bold letters in red at the VIP Road approach to Bangur Avenue now announces that vehicles wont be allowed to stop other than at the designated point.        
	But is it working? The most appalling thing is their attitude. They behave as if no power on earth can stop them from flouting the rules, said Sulekha, a widow who works in a private healthcare centre.        
	Sulekha has been managing traffic during the morning rush hour before leaving for work. Its tough but I know I can do it, she said.        
	Son Subhankar, a regional manager in a pharma company, is encouraging, as are the families of the other women.        
	Arunas husband Taraknath, an engineer with the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority, said he didnt object to his wife managing traffic because it was something she wanted to do from her heart. Younger son Sayan said he was proud of his mother. I will be happy to join her. But she is not allowing me because my board examinations are approaching, said the Class X student.        
	Although some people have been making snide remarks about the four-woman army, many residents of Bangur have pledged their support. Trader B.K. Saraf, a resident of Block B, said: This is the need of the hour. Its easier to tell others how to do something than setting an example for others to follow.        
	The Lake Town traffic guard has promised to step in if anybody tries to bully the Bangur women.        
	For now, the only ones with a reason to feel bullied are the chief ministers just-dont-do-it men in uniform.        
	Is D-I-Y the way to curb road rogues? Tell ttmetroabpmail.com

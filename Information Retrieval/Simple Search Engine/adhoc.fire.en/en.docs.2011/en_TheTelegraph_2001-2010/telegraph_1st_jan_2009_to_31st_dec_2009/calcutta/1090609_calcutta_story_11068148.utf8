The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Norms soon for Xaviers batch
                                                                                                               Norms soon for Xaviers batch
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          The first batch of students admitted to St Xaviers College after it became autonomous is about to graduate                                   
	Calcutta University is likely to finalise the criteria for admitting graduates from autonomous colleges that were once affiliated to it, such as St Xaviers, this week.        
	A committee set up by the university in February to fix the norms for admitting students of the autonomous colleges to postgraduate departments will place its recommendations before the syndicate for approval on Thursday, said a CU official.         
	The syndicate is one of the two highest decision making bodies of the university.        
	An autonomous college can frame its own syllabi, conduct examinations and award degrees. The marksheets and certificates bear the stamps of both the college and the university.         
	St Xaviers College in 2006 became the first college affiliated to CU to be granted autonomy. The batch admitted to the college that year will graduate this year.         
	After St Xaviers, two colleges run by the Ramakrishna Mission were granted autonomy.        
	The recommendations regarding admission of students from autonomous colleges that were once attached to our university will soon be placed before the syndicate for approval. We can finalise the admission procedure to be followed by the university for admitting graduates from the autonomous colleges only after an unanimous decision by the syndicate in this regard, said Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee, the CU pro vice-chancellor (academic).        
	The admission for the universitys postgraduate courses starts in August.        
	According to sources, the panel is not of the view that graduates from the autonomous colleges should be treated on a par with their counterparts from the colleges affiliated to CU. It has recommended a separate procedure for admitting students from autonomous colleges.        
	Admission through entrance tests and on the basis of percentile are among the steps suggested by the committee, said a source.        
	Under the existing rules, graduates from colleges affiliated to CU are offered 95 per cent of the seats in its postgraduate courses and do not necessarily have to seat for entrance examinations. Five per cent of the seats are earmarked for students of other universities.        
	The panel feels that students of the autonomous colleges should not be treated as outsiders and offered the five per cent seats meant for students of other universities as was proposed by a section of officials last year, said the source.        
	The committee has reached the conclusion that graduates of the autonomous college should be offered seats from the 95 per cent slot but the selection process should be different from that for students of colleges affiliated to CU, he added.

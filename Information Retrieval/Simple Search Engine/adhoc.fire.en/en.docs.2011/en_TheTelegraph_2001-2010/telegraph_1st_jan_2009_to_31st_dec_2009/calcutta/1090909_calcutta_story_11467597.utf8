The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Golden chance gone: architect
                                                                                                               Golden chance gone: architect
          SUBHRO SAHA                            Architect Hafeez Contractor, who had been engaged by the developers of the now shelved IT park at Kolkata Links near Vedic Village (Telegraph picture above)                                 
	...Infosys also engaged the renowned architect, Hafeez Contractor, whose services are extensively used by the company for their projects... the state IT department in its note announcing the scrapping of Bengal Diamond Vedic IT Links, the 1,200-acre IT township next to Vedic Village.        
	When Metro broke the news to Hafeez Contractor on Tuesday, the architect said from Mumbai: Its a golden opportunity lost for Calcutta.... Im extremely sad to learn that the project has been scrapped. One must think beyond politics to get such defining projects off the block.        
	Contractor, who already has a design imprint in the city with his signature 22 Camac Street project and the DLF IT park in New Town Rajarhat, was the lead architect engaged by the developers of the now-abandoned mega IT township.        
	We had planned an eco-friendly township with almost 70 per cent green, open spaces and lots of water bodies. An 18-hole golf course was also part of the master design, besides an integrated sports complex and a clutch of recreation opportunities, including retail malls, said Contractor.        
	The total area proposed to be constructed and developed off Rajarhat was 21 million square feet. This included commercial office space for IT and ITeS as well as non-IT offices, retail and residential formats, including condos and bungalows, plus healthcare and social amenities.        
	The architect who has also designed Varnaparichay  the countrys first integrated book mall on College Street, replacing the ramshackle College Street civic market  felt that the shelving of the IT project would hit perception of Calcutta to a large extent.        
	Contractor, who started out in 1968 with T. Khareghat as an apprentice architect, has dabbled with post-modernism forms, but has often been criticised for being gimmicky in his designs.

                                                                                                               Figure fib in House
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Trinamul Congress MLA Sovandeb Chattopadhyay said in the Assembly on Wednesday that transport minister Subhas Chakraborty had given contradictory figures on the number of two-stroke autos converted to four stroke.        
	The minister had said in the Assembly on Tuesday that 4,336 autos had converted from two-stroke to four stroke. But a week earlier, the state had filed an affidavit in the Assembly saying only 1,066 had been converted.        
	Chakraborty was not in the House when the issue was raised. The Speaker told Chattopadhyay he could raise the matter in the form of a question.

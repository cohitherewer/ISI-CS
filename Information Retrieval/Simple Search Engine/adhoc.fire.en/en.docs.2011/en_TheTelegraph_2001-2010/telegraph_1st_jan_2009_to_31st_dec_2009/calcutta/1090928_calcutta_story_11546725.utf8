The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | If this was the spirit for 52 weeks!
                                                                                                               If this was the spirit for 52 weeks!
  - Why is this grand festival hidden from the global scene?          SANJAY WADVANI                                                Wadvani at True Spirit Model Puja Mitali on Saturday. (Sanat Kr Sinha)        
	I left this city when I was just seven years old. It was 35 years ago and its more of sensory memories as a child than about the meaning of Puja.        
	From what I remember there used to be small pujas, the size of the stalls I saw at the pandals on Saturday. It was very basic with bright lights and loud music. The scale has definitely changed.        
	The festival has become very commercial. It reflects how society is increasing in wealth. It also signifies certain success in society. But then it is also a reminder of people who dont have access to all the good things around.        
	Puja perhaps is a leveller. It brings everyone together. They are all out feeling happy and enjoying the same things. Its not so much about the religious significance but the lights, music and sweets. The Durga puja is also a very good message on greater tolerance in terms of religion.        
	For these few days, it doesnt matter who wins or loses. Everyone takes part and enjoys, putting aside their troubles. Its good to see all the kids enjoying themselves. Its like a family day out for four days. The whole vibe seems such that people come out feeling happy. They experience the lights, music and drum beats.         
	One thing thats great about the pujas is people think about giving. It would be good if they could show that kind of social conscience for all 52 weeks. It was nice to see people fasting before offering flowers on Ashtami and then feed everyone from the community. It would be nice if such charity work could be sustained throughout the year.        
	Themed pandals are a good idea and a lot of people have picked up on climate change and educating people on what is happening in the modern world as well as the use of greens since Bengal is under great threat of climate change.         
	Why is Durga puja well hidden from the global scene? This seems like one of the largest outdoor festivals in the world and it could be presented to people living outside to attract non-Indian visitors.        
	Its such a great time that maybe Tourism India could advertise the festival in terms of selling the pujas as an event. Not simply point people to Kerala and Rajasthan. Instead, make this one more inviting for all the attractive food, lights, people and music at hand. Even the way the idols are submerged in the waters make for an interesting experience.        
	If it was me, Id definitely opt for Durga puja!

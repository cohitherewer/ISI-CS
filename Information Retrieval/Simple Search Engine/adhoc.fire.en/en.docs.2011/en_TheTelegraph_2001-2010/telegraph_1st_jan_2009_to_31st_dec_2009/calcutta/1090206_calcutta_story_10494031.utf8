The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Natures moods in colours   Paintings as natures last redoubt 
                                                                                                               Natures moods in colours     - Paramjit singhs show begins in Cima gallery today          SOUMITRA DAS                          Paramjit Singh in front of his canvas of flaming gulmohars at CIMA Gallery, where an exhibition of his latest works opens on Friday. Picture by Pradip Sanyal                                        
	Paramjit Singh is in a relaxed mood. In CIMA Gallery on Thursday, on the eve of the opening of his solo exhibition there, he says with a chuckle in an obvious reference to the economic recession: These are the best days to paint. No pressure. Nothing is happening. So he is taking his time to paint large works  a triptych  in Delhi.        
	The artists favourite kikkar and gulmohar trees are here again, and so are the grassy dales. He uses soft pastel, oils and charcoal to evoke nature in a pristine state, a world that mostly inhabits the artists memory and imagination. It is not just his walks in Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Delhi of bygone days that he is trying to conjure up.        
	His landscapes could justifiably be interpreted as abstract works where the artist is experimenting with space, form and light and where representation is not his primary concern. The pigment itself becomes Paramjits medium of expression for capturing the various moods of nature.              
	But the riot of red and gold, of pink and viridian, yellow and green in gaudily contrasting shades is also most certainly forests in flame, grassy knolls bristling with wild cane (kaas phool) heavy with their feathery bloom glistening in sunset, golden sandbanks, still pools and rills gurgling through forestland.        
	Paramjits palette is rainbow hued and he stabs his canvases with pigment to create a thick layer that adds body to his landscapes. It is interesting to take a close look at his brushwork and discover the intricate web of conflicting and dissimilar colours he uses to create the impression of trees heavily laden with leaves, without actually depicting them in detail as his favourite Pahari miniature painters did in the past.        
	Paramjit is deeply influenced by the modernist movement and the Impressionists and juxtaposes complementary shades to create a sense of harmony. The paint application is rigorous to begin with and gradually my hand becomes softer. The emerald, viridian and cerulean blue become very poetic. The white grass is in flower in August-September and it brilliantly catches the sunset. I made it more linear to create the impression of the movement of breeze.        
	Paramjits charcoal drawings with their dark forests, moonlit pathways and brooding groves are imbued with a sense of mystery, as if the viewer is in the presence of nature, as Wordsworth conceived it.        
	The artist says: When I am doing them it is all about form, space and light. The whole thing is concentrated. It is very intense, mysterious drama. But after doing it I think of so many colours. The colours emerge. The black and whites are small essays.        
	Ultimately, it is the Jackson Pollock-like flurry of brushstrokes and the busy tango of hues that turn Paramjits canvases into natures last redoubt.

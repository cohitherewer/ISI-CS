The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Safe house for donors
                                                                                                               Safe house for donors
  - Arrested eatery owner a key member of kidney racket          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	The nation-wide kidney racket had a system in place to entice prospective donors, choose the best and shift them to a safe house before preparing documents needed for a transplant, according to investigators.        
	A rented building in Dakshinpara Morepukur in Rishra, on the outskirts of the city, served as the safe house, said police. All those who donated their kidneys in 2007 and 2008 were allegedly put up in the house.         
	The modalities of the transplant were jointly handled by Manik Chowdhury and Joydipta Roy, alias Laltu, with their boss Dipu Dutta overseeing operations from Chennai, said an investigator.         
	While Partha was arrested on February 19, cops caught 38-year-old Joydipta outside Sealdah station on Monday evening before he took a train out of the city.        
	Joydipta would place advertisements in newspapers for kidney donors, posing as a patient in immediate need of a transplant. Those who responded to the advertisement would be thoroughly screened and the best selected. The details of the rest would be kept in a data bank, said an investigating officer.        
	Joydipta, the owner of a fast food shop in Nonachandanpukur in Titagarh, North 24-Parganas, told interrogators that he had handled a Rs 3-lakh transplant last December. He allegedly persuaded Ranjan Hela to donate his organ for Nidhon Roy. The transplant was carried out in a private hospital on the Bypass.        
	Joydipta paid Hela Rs 90,000, the highest a donor had received from the racket. Investigators said Joydipta was instrumental in roping in a donor named Amit Ghosh for a transplant carried out in a Chennai-based hospital. The cops are still in the dark about the deal but have found out that Ghosh had met Dipu, the alleged mastermind.        
	Joydipta had come in contact with Dutta while donating his kidney in 2002 to Parveen at a Chennai-based hospital.        
	Investigators are yet to ascertain the number of transplants Joydipta and Manik had jointly arranged.        
	It appears that Manik was instrumental in carrying out at least six transplants in a New Delhi-based hospital. Manik used to stay in a rented house on the outskirts of New Delhi and oversee the transplants carried out in the capital. After police started looking for him, Manik fled to the village in South 24-Parganas from where he was caught, said an investigator.

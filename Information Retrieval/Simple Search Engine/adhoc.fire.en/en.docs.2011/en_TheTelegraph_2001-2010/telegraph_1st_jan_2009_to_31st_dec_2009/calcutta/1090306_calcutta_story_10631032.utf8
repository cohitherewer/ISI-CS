The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Poll to push back HS result
                                                                                                               Poll to push back HS result
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The results of this years Higher Secondary (HS) examinations could be delayed because of teachers from state-aided schools being engaged in election duty.        
	Sources in the West Bengal Council for Higher Secondary Education said another factor could be school premises being used as voting centres for the three-phased Lok Sabha polls in the state.         
	This years HS exams are scheduled to start on March 16 and continue till April 16. Polling in Bengal will be held on April 30 and May 7 and 13.        
	A Supreme Court ruling makes it mandatory for all boards across the country holding Class XII exams to declare the results by June 10. Most boards declare the results between May 17 and 30.        
	We intend declaring the results before June 10 but wont be able to do so on or around May 20, unlike last year, a senior official said.         
	Swapan Kumar Sarkar, the secretary of the Higher Secondary council, said everything would depend on how many teachers the election department requisitioned for poll duty.         
	We will appeal to the election department not to engage our examiners in any election-related activity, he said.        
	The council would require around 28,000 teachers to evaluate the answer scripts of 4,67,576 examinees this year.        
	The council will set up a control room to register examination-related complaints from students, teachers, schools and guardians. The control room numbers are 23374945, 23596525 and 23379661.

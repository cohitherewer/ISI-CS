The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Smart scanner for landmarks
                                                                                                               Smart scanner for landmarks

	Howrah bridge and Metro Railway, among the prominent landmarks of the city, may soon come under intelligent surveillance.        
	As part of the drive prompted by recent terror strikes across the country, the authorities are planning to install intelligent gadgets that emit signals at the hint of danger and help cops track down the source.        
	The Calcutta Port Trust (CPT), the custodian of Howrah bridge, has decided to instal trackers in the six cameras that scan the 65-year-old structure round the clock. The high-resolution cameras, which can rotate 360 degrees and record the registration numbers of moving vehicles, were installed last year.        
	The special software will track erratic behaviour of any object, animate or inanimate, and trigger an alarm, a CPT official said. We have sought details of the project, including the cost, from the company that has installed the cameras.        
	The cameras can scan traffic movement and other activities on and under the bridge and can also record accidents. The intelligent trackers will pick up signals of any imminent danger, the official pointed out.        
	One officer now mans all six cameras in a shift. It is not always possible for one person to monitor the feed captured by six cameras simultaneously and there are always chances of some suspicious movement going unnoticed. The new software will help fill in the gap, the official said.        
	The cameras have been installed in a way that they cover the entire 705-metre-long and 30-metre-wide structure.         
	Two of them have been placed on the underside to track the movement of barges, steamers and boats on the Hooghly.        
	The other four are on the bottom boom chord (the first layer of beams)  one at each end and two in the middle. They monitor vehicular movement on the bridge. The CPT has spent around Rs 60 lakh on the project.        
	Similar cameras will soon be installed at Netaji Subhas Dock and Kidderpore Dock, two other gateways to the city.        
	The move by the CPT comes close on the heels of a proposal sent by Metro Railway to the Railway Board for intelligent scanners for all 17 stations. The Rs 42-crore proposal focuses on upgrading the cameras at the stations with sophisticated software to spot any unidentified or abandoned object on the premises.        
	Surveillance has taken on a different dimension, with cameras doubling as identifiers and setting off alarms at the hint of danger. This helps bring down the reaction time of security forces, said Jayanta Mitra, the chief operating officer of the Metro Railway.        
	The proposal includes controlled access to the stations, installation of baggage scanners and explosives detectors and an increase in the number of personnel manning the facilities.

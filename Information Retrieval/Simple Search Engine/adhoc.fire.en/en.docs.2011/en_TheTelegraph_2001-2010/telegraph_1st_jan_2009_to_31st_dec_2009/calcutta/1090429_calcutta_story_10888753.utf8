The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Poll shirt with Dev-Nil tips
                                                                                                               Poll shirt with Dev-Nil tips

	Designer wear seems to be the dress code for comrades this poll season. The CPM on Tuesday unveiled its campaign shirt, inspired by suggestions from designer duo Dev R Nil.         
	The shirt comes just two days after the partys campaign kurta designed by Agnimitra Paul made its debut. A fortnight ago, the CPM revealed its campaign saris 2009, based on tips by designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee.        
	CPM activist Tapas Das of Jorasanko couldnt stop talking about his new shirt. Its got an emphatic look, isnt it? Its bound to grab eyeballs. I love this shirt, he beamed.        
	The shirt has been designed by Indra Madhab Dutta, the convener of the CPMs ward 23 committee, and the brains behind the Sabya-inspired campaign sari.        
	I read about Dev R Nils suggestions for a campaign T-shirt in Metro (April 16). Inspired by their tips, I designed T-shirts and shirts for the CPM. Weve all seen saris and T-shirts being used in campaigns. My daughter Ishani and I wanted to do something unique, hence the shirt, said the 58-year-old graphic designer, who has been creating pamphlets and souvenirs for the CPM since 1995.         
	Dev R Nil had suggested: T-shirts for the younger party members, with a bold Karl Marx face printed on it. But Dutta decided to dump Marx for the hammer-sickle-and-star.        
	Using Marx, Lenin, or Che would make artistic sense, but the shirts and T-shirts are for a local campaign; they would be used in the civic elections next year too. So we did not use images of international stalwarts, said Dutta.        
	In all cotton, the beige shirt sports nearly two dozen small party symbols on the collar, sleeves and body. A larger hammer-sickle-and-star symbol adorns the breast pocket. On the back is another large party symbol with VOTE C.P.I. (M) written in bold letters.         
	The white cotton T-shirts are simpler, with just one large CPM symbol in front.         
	A CD bearing the design at one-third the actual size was handed over to A. Saheb in Metiabruz, who manufactures T-shirts for the CPM.        
	At Rs 75 a piece, the shirts and T-shirts will cost the CPM around Rs 15,000, said party leader Debanjan Chakraborty.         
	We have ordered 100 T-shirts and 100 shirts for now, which we should receive in a couple of days. They will be handed out to comrades by our local committee, said Dutta.

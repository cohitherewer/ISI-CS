The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Next weekend you can be at ... Palash Parban
                                                                                                               Next weekend you can be at ... Palash Parban
                                          
	Palash Parban is a festival held during Dol at Deulghat, Garjoypur, in the Joypur block of Purulia district. A group of Purulia lovers has been organising the event for the past nine years.        
	Next to the fairground, on the bank of the Kansai river, tents that can house up to six people each, are put up for visitors from Calcutta and beyond.                  
	About 700 people visit the three-day festival, including about 200 from Calcutta. Bed and board are provided against a registration fee.        
	From 6pm, folk programmes are held on the fairground. About 12,000 villagers from the surroun- ding areas watch the performances.        
	During the day, one can undertake trips to nearby tourist spots like the Ayodhya Hills, Balarampur, Jhalda, Tulin, Raghunathpur and Manbazar.        
	The Ayodhya Hills, a part of the Chhotanagpur plateau, are the primary tourist attraction of the region. With an average altitude of about 200m, the highland attracts rock-climbers and trekkers. Many of them make their way to the rocky cliffs of Bagmundi, to the west of the Ayodhya Hills.        
	The trail from Sirkabad to Ayodhya is ideal for jungle trekking. The 13km journey through a jungle dotted with simul and palash takes about six hours.                  
	Red soil, dense forests and old temples characterise the picturesque landscape. The tribal villages are an added attraction. The deul (which means temple) beside the fairground is a favourite among visitors.        
	The river, palash and simul trees in full bloom and performances of Chhau, Jhumur, Nachni, Natua, Baul, Gambhira and Domni make for a wonderful holiday during Palash Parban.        
	The fair is not merely a means to draw tourists. Its organised by local residents, whose warmth is the biggest bonus of a trip. The event is also a celebration of cultural forms that they have managed to protect in the face of abject poverty.        
	Facilities are excellent for city dwellers. The organisers even set up a stall in Purulia station to guide visitors.        
	I used to spend Dol in Santiniketan. After attending Palash Parban in 2005, I have gone back to Deulghat every year.        
	Going         
	Take a train from Howrah to Purulia. Rupasi Bangla in the morning, Purulia Express in the afternoon and Adra Chakradharpur Express at night are some of the options. Take a bus or a car to Joypur, 24km down Ranchi Road towards Jhalda. Turn left and proceed another 1.5km to the festival venue. Overnight buses are available from Esplanade to Joypur in the late evening.                
	Staying         
	Tents on the festival ground.         
	Hotels and guest houses are also available. This years festival starts on March 10, 5pm.

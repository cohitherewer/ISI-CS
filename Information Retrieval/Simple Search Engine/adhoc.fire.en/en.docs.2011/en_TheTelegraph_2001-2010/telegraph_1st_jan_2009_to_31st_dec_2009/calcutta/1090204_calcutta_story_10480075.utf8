The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Wanted: truth amp; damages
                                                                                                               Wanted: truth amp; damages
  - Parents of girl allegedly killed by teacher slap move HC          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                                                      Iftesham		      
	The parents of Iftesham Chowdhury, the eight-year-old girl who died allegedly after being slapped by her yoga teacher, have filed a petition in the high court seeking Rs 50 lakh in compensation from the state.        
	Chowdhury Mansur Rahman and Najneen also prayed for a CBI probe into the sequence of events at Mominpurs Vidya Bharati School on November 27 that led to their only childs death the next day.        
	Hinting at a collusion between the school and police, the parents sought to know why the accused teacher, Anita Das, was booked under the bailable offence of death due to negligence (IPC Section 304A), instead of the more stringent culpable homicide not amounting to murder (Section 304). Section 304 carries a punishment of 10 years rigorous imprisonment, while Section 304A carries a two-year jail term.        
	Iftesham, alias Muskan, was allegedly slapped by Das so hard that she lost her balance and rammed her head against a wall. According to her parents, the Class II student was crying in pain but the teacher still forced her to perform yoga. Iftesham started vomiting and then went into a coma.        
	She was taken to Calcutta Medical Research Institute, where she died of cerebral haematoma on the night of November 28.        
	Chowdhury Mansur Rahman told Metro that he had sought a CBI probe to know the truth about what had happened to their daughter.        
	I have been hearing many versions of the event. I have heard that my daughter was hit by more than one person that day. At times I feel like believing the yoga teachers statement that she had been framed. We want the truth to come out, he said.        
	The case is likely to come up for hearing soon. Since Iftesham was their only child, the petitioners have every right to claim compensation, said Tapas Bhanja, the lawyer for her parents.        
	Bhanja pointed out that the Supreme Court had banned corporal punishment in schools, terming it a criminal offence. According to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, teachers found guilty of assaulting students should be punished.        
	The lawyer also questioned the chief judicial magistrates order granting bail to the accused teacher. The magistrate should have slapped more stringent charges on the teacher.

          A STAFF REPORTER                          Sheibalak Singh at the hospital. (Gopal Senapati)                            
	A centurian has been operated on at a private hospital in Howrah and a tumour removed from his urinary bladder.        
	Sheibalak Singh, a resident of Asansol, underwent surgery on November 2 and was released on Monday. Doctors said he was recovering satisfactorily.        
	Singh, according to his voter identity card, is 101 but he claims he is 108. Singh was losing blood through urine and suffering from severe respiratory problems when he was admitted to West Bank Hospital on November 2.        
	A cystoscopy conducted on the patient revealed a medium-sized tumour in the urinary bladder.        
	A medical board, led by laparoscopic surgeon Partha Sen, was set up to decide on the course of treatment.        
	The doctors finally decided to perform the operation  Trans Uretheral Surgery  to remove the tumour. A team led by uro-surgeon Arnab Dey performed the procedure.        
	It was a huge challenge to operate on a man of such an advanced age. Besides, the patient was weak from sustained blood loss. His respiratory disorders further compounded the problems, said Sen.        
	Singhs youngest son Kuber said his father was under the treatment of a doctor in Asansol who referred him to Sen.        
	My father has always maintained good health. He became weak only after he started losing blood through urine, said 56-year-old Kuber.

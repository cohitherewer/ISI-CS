The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bay key to Diwali
                                                                                                               Bay key to Diwali
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	A low-pressure area over the Bay of Bengal may cast a cloud on Diwali though the weatherman is in wait-and- watch mode.        
	The 2.5mm of rain the city received on Wednesday was because of localised thunderclouds and not the Bay formation.        
	The low pressure has formed over the east-central Bay. We will get a clearer picture by Thursday. Till then we cant say for sure whether itll be a wet Diwali this year, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.        
	Met officials said the low pressure has started weakening and chances are it may fizzle out by Thursday.

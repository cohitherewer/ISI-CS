The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Luxury hotel chain eyes city
                                                                                                               Luxury hotel chain eyes city
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	A luxury hotel chain with owners from Kenya and funding from the Gulf wants to set up shop in the city, bringing hope at a time when Calcuttas hospitality dream lies in tatters. Not even 20 per cent of the projected 2,000-plus new five-star rooms in the city are expected to be ready by 2010.        
	The Zuri Hotels amp; Resorts, part of a multinational conglomerate promoted by a consortium of investors from West Asia, with its India headquarters in Bangalore, on Tuesday made its initial overtures for a slice of the citys hospitality pie.        
	We are bullish on Calcutta because of its cultural heritage. Initially we are looking at a management model, tying up with an existing property having around 150 keys, Priti Chand, director (communication) of the group, told Metro.        
	The Zuri group is also open to setting up its own property soon. We are looking for around two acres, preferably around the central business district, for a Rs 200-crore five-star deluxe hotel with 150 to 200 rooms, Chand said.        
	To create a brand recall, the group is offering Puja packages (priced at Rs 6,000 per couple per night) for The Zuri Kumarakom Resort and Spa in Kerala, one of the four luxury properties under its India operations.        
	The other properties under the Zuri brand in India are the Whitefield in Bangalore, the Varca White Sands and The Retreat in Goa, both erstwhile Radisson hotels.

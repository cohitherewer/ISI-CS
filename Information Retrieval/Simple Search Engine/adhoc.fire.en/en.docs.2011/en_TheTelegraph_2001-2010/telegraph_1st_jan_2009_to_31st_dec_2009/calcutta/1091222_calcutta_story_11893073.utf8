          DEEPANKAR GANGULY AND SUBHAJOY ROY                              
	Raj Bhavan and Writers Buildings lead a list of state-run addresses that owe more than Rs 250 crore to the civic body as property tax dues.        
	An official said the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) was saddled with property tax dues of more than Rs 700 crore, which has accumulated over the past decade.        
	Apart from a host of private buildings, the defaulters on CMC lists include Raj Bhavan, Writers Buildings, New Secretariat, Presidency College, NRS Medical College, the fisheries department and the state housing board. A CMC office, too, owes money to the headquarters.        
	Sources said Raj Bhavan owed the CMC Rs 5 crore while Writers had run up dues of Rs 3.8 crore. Presidency College has an outstanding of Rs 3 crore and NRS, Rs 6 crore.        
	The civic revenue department has published two lists of defaulters. There are 241 names on the first list, each owing Rs 1 crore or more to the civic body. The second has 350 buildings and the dues of each varies between Rs 50 lakh and Rs 99 lakh.        
	A finance officer of Raj Bhavan said: We have received the notice and will clear the dues in time.        
	Fisheries minister Kiranmoy Nanda, slapped with a default notice, said: This is something the officials can clarify. Its not possible for a minister to keep track of everything.        
	The CMC started sending notices to the defaulters from December 14. We are asking the owners of the buildings to clear their dues within a fortnight of receiving the notice, said Aniruddha Mukherjee, the chief manager (revenue).        
	Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya has apparently asked municipal commissioner Arnab Ray to be prepared to attach the properties of the defaulters if they failed to pay up within the deadline.        
	Defaulters must pay up. We are empowered to take legal steps if they dont. But well be happy if that unpleasant situation can be avoided and the defaulters pay up within 15 days of receiving our notice, the mayor said.        
	Some CMC officials suggested at a meeting on Saturday that the interest on the dues  18 per cent annually  be waived to ensure prompt realisation of the principal, but the mayor shot down the proposal.

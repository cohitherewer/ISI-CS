The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pay civic fees in cash
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Pay civic fees in cash

	House taxes and licence fees up to Rs 10,000 can soon be deposited to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation without the hassle of getting demand drafts.         
	Since the funds defalcation at the Gariahat treasury three years ago, the civic body has been accepting payments over Rs 2,000 only in demand drafts. The CMC collects over Rs 400 crore a year in house taxes and other fees. Thousands of people who deposit the money are forced to run to the banks first to get demand drafts. They also have to shell out service charges between Rs 10 and Rs 50 to the banks.         
	We have received several complaints about the demand draft system from those who pay taxes and licence fees. We are planning to change the system, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.        
	The chief of municipal finance and accounts, Debotosh Dasgupta, said fake Rs 500 notes and bounced cheques had also forced the switch to the bank draft system. Most house and flat owners in the city pay the civic body an annual property tax of over Rs 2,000. Many house owners would like to pay their property tax for the four quarters at one go. After the introduction of the draft system, they have started depositing money every quarter to avoid the hassles of getting demand drafts issued by a bank. Some of the house owners feel the charges for getting a draft are an additional burden, said a civic official.

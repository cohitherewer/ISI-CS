The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 50-crore scheme to clean city canals
                                                                                                               50-crore scheme to clean city canals
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The civic authorities are preparing a blueprint to clean up three city canals with financial help from the Centre.         
	Calcutta Port Trust and the state irrigation department are the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC)s partners in planning the Rs 50-crore scheme to clear the Chetla Boat Canal, Tollys Nullah and the New Cut Canal.         
	The Ganga River Basin Authoritys refusal to allow untreated municipal sewage and industrial waste to be dumped in the waterways and canals connected to the Ganga has necessitated the plan, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.        
	While the Chetla Boat Canal is maintained by the CMC, the New Cut Canal and the Tollys Nullah are looked after by the irrigation department and Calcutta Port Trust, respectively.        
	All three canals are from the colonial era and have become breeding ground of mosquitoes because of a lack of maintenance and misuse.         
	Municipal commissioner Arnab Roy said the Ganga River Basin Authority would shoulder 70 per cent of the project cost while the stakeholders would pay 30 per cent. The scheme will be a part of Mission Clean Ganga 2020, announced by the authority earlier in the month.         
	We have drawn up a Rs 10-crore scheme for the rejuvenation of the Chetla Boat Canal. Besides beautification, the canal will be lined with tiles and in some parts, the embankment and the canal bed will be re-excavated, said civic chief engineer (drainage amp; sewerage) Amit Kumar Roy.        
	Over 2.5km long, the canal originates from Kidderpore dock area on Bhukailash Road and meets the Tollys Nullah at Chetla. The Chetla Boat Canal, which is over 12 feet wide, was excavated during the British period to provide water to the Kidderpore dock.         
	The Tollys Nullah is the longest and the oldest of the three canals. It will celebrate its bicentenary next year. About Rs 29 crore has been spent on it during the extension of Metro Railway to Garia.         
	The state irrigation department had also started cleaning up the New Cut Canal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Snags galore in Metro mess
                                                                                                               Snags galore in Metro mess
  - As politicians tussle over tamasha, passengers wait for chaos to end          SANJAY MANDAL                          Mamata at Sundays Metro function                                        
	Metro Railways starry start has been eclipsed by passenger peeve over delays, overcrowding and mismanagement. The spotlight may be on the political tug of war over the route extension  Mamata Banerjee on Friday termed Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees jibe at the inaugural tamasha as being in bad taste  but what thousands of commuters need to know is why the flag-off happened without proper planning and when the Metro mess will be sorted out.        
	Things were rushed and we should have spent some more time on planning to avoid such a mess, admitted a senior Metro official. The mess being referred to is the on-time performance dipping by more than 10 per cent after the launch of the Tollygunge-Garia Bazar extension, and rising commuter anger over crowding and chaos. On the first three days of the week, 12 trains had to be cancelled and around 10 per cent of the 212 trains were delayed, which is unprecedented in the 25-year-old history of the Metro Railway.        
	When Metro pinned down senior Metro Railway officials on Friday, this is what they blamed the mess on.        
	Lack of route familiarisation: Trial runs were conducted for the new 6km stretch but most drivers have not been familiarised with the route, forcing delays. The average speed is around 35kmph on the Dum Dum-Tollygunge stretch and around 31kmph on the extended stretch. Some trains are running slower on the new stretch, affecting the time-table. Trial runs are different from daily operations and the drivers will take some time to get familiar with the route, said J.K. Mitra, the chief operations manager of Metro Railway.        
	Slow track changing at Birji (Shahid Khudiram): Lack of familiarisation is slowing down track switching. We are trying to create a through signalling system for the empty rakes to prevent this, said Mitra.        
	Overcrowding: On Monday, Metro had more than 100,000 extra passengers while the estimate was for 80,000 extra passengers. Overcrowding on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday prevented doors from closing, causing a total delay of around 10 minutes for a train, said Mitra. Things have improved now.        
	Old signalling system: The absolute block system forces one train to wait two stations behind the earlier one. The new automatic signalling system, to be implemented soon, will reduce waiting time.

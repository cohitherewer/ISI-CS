The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | JEE shadow on seats
                                                                                                               JEE shadow on seats
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	A number of first-year seats in science subjects in prominent city colleges may remain vacant or have to be filled up with less deserving candidates because of the late start to the counselling session of the state joint entrance examination board.        
	Never in the past has JEE counselling begun so late, said the principal of a college.        
	Most students who have cracked the JEE have already taken admission in colleges to keep both options open.        
	Once the counselling is done, many of the first-year students will switch to engineering and medical courses, said Sanjib Ghosh, the principal of Presidency College.        
	The admission process in general degree colleges is almost over, while the counselling for the engineering and medical streams will begin on July 5 and 2, respectively.        
	According to a Calcutta University directive, the first-year classes in general degree colleges will begin by July 7.        
	Till 2007, only the last phase of counselling would remain unfinished when the colleges started admission.        
	Last year, the counselling started on June 20, three days before the college admission began.        
	A member of the JEE board said the counselling was deferred this year following a decision by the All India Council for Technical Education to grant the final approval to new colleges on June 30.        
	Those who will get a berth of their choice in the counselling will not join the college. The seats will either remain vacant or have to be filled up with undeserving candidates, a college principal added.        
	The authorities of Scottish Church, St Xaviers, Lady Brabourne, Bethune and Asutosh colleges fear the same problem.        
	First-year classes will begin in the first week of July. We will have to organise special classes in mid-August for those who will be admitted in the vacant seats. This will hamper smooth functioning of the college, said Dipak Kar, the principal of Asutosh College.

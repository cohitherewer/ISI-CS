The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tech colleges seek admission slack
                                                                                                               Tech colleges seek admission slack
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	At least 2,500 seats in private engineering colleges are lying vacant after the third round of counselling, prompting the managements to plead for relaxation of the admission criteria.         
	Of the 600-odd students who turned up in the third round for the 2,700 seats in private colleges that were left vacant after the first two phases of counselling, only 200 took admission.         
	The vacant seats are mostly in computer science and related courses which found fewer takers this year as the global downturn has robbed them of their job prospects.         
	In some institutions barely 30 per cent of the seats could be filled up after the third round of counselling. The colleges may be forced to shut down if the government does not take immediate measures to fill up the vacancies, said Dhurjoti Banerjee, the director of the Mallabhum Institute of Technology and an assistant secretary of the Association of Owners of Private Engineering Colleges.         
	A source in the higher education department said minister Sudarshan Ray Chaudhury would meet owners of the private colleges and officials of the West Bengal University of Technology on Tuesday to try and find a way out of the impasse.         
	Sources said the colleges would table a string of proposals at the meeting, including one on pushing back the cut-off rank on the JEE 2009 merit list from 60,000 to 75,000.         
	Candidates ranking up to 60,000 were called to the first two rounds of counselling. Those who did not turn up  around 50 per cent  were called to the third round.        
	The colleges hope to fill up most of the vacant seats if the minister agrees to fix the revised cut-off at 75,000.        
	According to the rule, a student cracking the JEE could be admitted to an engineering college if he scores at least 50 per cent each in physics, chemistry and mathematics in the Higher Secondary or equivalent examination. Sources said the representatives of private colleges would press the government to lower the criterion to 45 per cent.         
	A third proposal of the colleges would be to extend the cut-off on the merit list of the All India Engineering Entrance Examinations (AIEEE), through which a private institution fills up 10 per cent of its seats.         
	The norm is to call students ranking within 3.86 lakh on the AIEEE merit list for counselling.         
	An official in the higher education department, however, said: The government has to examine the proposals well as it cannot allow colleges to admit students of low merit for the sake of filling up seats.         
	But will a fresh counselling be organised for the vacant seats in the private colleges? Only if the government asks us to, said Sidhartha Dutta, the chairman of the joint entrance examination board. He, however, admitted that some private colleges might suffer because of a drop in interest among students in IT, computer science and related subjects following the slowdown.

                      Artists protest against inhumanity                    Urban life, with its inevitable ebb and flow, has inspired the works of Arindam Chatterjee. However, to claim that he simply portrays experiences of life in the metropolis would be an understatement. The ongoing show of his recent works, done in oil, acrylic, charcoal and pastel on paper, reflects his despondency and desperation with the decadence of the human value system, particularly within the urban, educated mainstream of contemporary society. His works are an illustration of his personal musings, of his shocked response at mans insensitivity to the grief, distress, perils and exigencies of his fellow beings. His artistic efforts are, in fact, a part of his attempt to break out of the alarming wall of apprehension and despair within which he feels entrapped. Painting like a man possessed, he encapsulates his own experiences of life, revealing the horrifying suicidal anti-joy he finds himself surrounded with. Contemplating the incertitude, fear, misgivings and scepticism of modern, urban life, the artist dedicates his work to these fragile, restless, helpless and despairing times, with the hope that the human race will soon overcome its predicament and rise above the condition to usher in a peaceful, promising future.                  Event: An exhibition of art works on paper by Arindam Chatterjee When: Till August 25; 3 pm - 8 pm Where: Chitrakoot Art Gallery, 55 Gariahat Road

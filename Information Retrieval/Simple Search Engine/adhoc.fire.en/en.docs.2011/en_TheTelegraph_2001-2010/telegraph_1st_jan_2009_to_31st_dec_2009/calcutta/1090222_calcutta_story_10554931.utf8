The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A lifetime of films
                                                                                                               A lifetime of films
										      Book bazaar                        The cover of Chalacchitro Ajiban				                           
	For the first days of shooting for Kabuliwala, veteran actor Chhabi Biswas turned up in the zari-embellished finery that Kabuliwalas wear only during festivities, but no one dared to ask him to change. It was only after three days of shooting that director Tapan Sinha, then a youngster, sent word to him that something more ordinary would perhaps be more appropriate for the role.         
	These and many other anecdotes, insights and intimate experiences of Tapan Sinha can be found in Chalacchitro Ajiban, recently brought out by Deys Publishing. The 496-page tome, priced at Rs 350, is a must-have for any admirer or student of Sinhas films. The book is a collection of all his writings. There are three memoirs  Bioscoper Banke Banke (1978), Mone Pore, on his childhood, friends and colleagues (1995), and Kichhu Chhaya Kichhu Chhobi (2006).         
	The book includes Sinhas articles on filmmaking and personalities and his interviews published in various magazines. It also contains songs written and composed by Sinha for his films and his play Galpo Hekim Saheb. A selection of movie stills and other pictures are added attractions.         
	Picturesque tales        
	To an entire generation of Bengali illustrators Saila Chakraborty was the ideal cartoonist  the unbeatable substitute of the written word. Known primarily as the illustrator of Sibram Chakrabortys stories (they were often mistaken for brothers) Saila played illustrator and cover-designer to Rabindranath Tagore too. His cartoons appeared in Sanibarer Chitthi, Sachitra Bharat, Dainik Basumati, Sandesh, Ananda Bazaar Patrika and Amritabazar Patrika.         
	But his artistic skills unfortunately eclipsed his ability to write. Throughout his life Saila has written countless childrens stories, rhymes, fairy tales, science fiction, skits, craft guides and handbooks. He used to write scripts for his puppet shows (he is an acknowledged pioneer of modern Indian puppetry) and contribute columns on science to Anandabazar Patrika.         
	His anthologies, the few that were published, have long gone out of print and it took College Street publishers Mandakranta quite an effort to collect the scattered writings into a 320-page volume to commemorate Saila Chakrabortys birth centenary in March.         
	Senior artist Ganesh Haloi has designed the cover of the book and artists Wasim Kapoor and Debashish Deb are also contributing illustrations to go inside.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Awareness drive for pig handlers 
                                                                                                               Awareness drive for pig handlers 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The civic health authorities have launched an awareness campaign on swine flu among pig handlers and pork sellers after receiving an alert from the state health department.        
	The drive is directed at residents of civic sweeper colonies, pig keepers, pig handlers at the slaughterhouse on Gobinda Khatik Road and pork sellers in New Market, Beleghata, Tollygunge, Entally, Tangra and Poddar Court areas.         
	Asit Biswas, the assistant director of health services (in-charge of public health and communicable diseases) had sent the alert notice to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) last week. Acting on the alert, municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay directed civic health officials to visit these city pockets regularly, even on Sundays.        
	Civic health officials visited the pork market housed in Hudco Building opposite New Market and the pig slaughterhouse on Gobinda Khatik Road and advised the workers to handle pigs and pig products cautiously. They also spoke about the symptoms of swine flu and advised the workers to visit the Infectious Diseases (ID) Hospital if needed.        
	According to chief municipal health officer DebDwaipayan Chattopadhyay, anti-viral drugs are also available but timely detection is more important. Since the symptoms of swine flu are similar to those of common cold, its impossible to distinguish the HINI strain on the basis of symptoms alone, he pointed out. Swine flu can be confirmed by clinical tests of sputum or nasal swab.         
	The most common symptoms of swine flu include fever, cough, sore throat and fatigue. Nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea can also occur. The symptoms vary in severity from person to person.

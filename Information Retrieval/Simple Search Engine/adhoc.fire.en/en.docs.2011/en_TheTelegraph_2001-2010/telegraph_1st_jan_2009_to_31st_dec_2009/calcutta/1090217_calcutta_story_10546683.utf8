	The Howrah-Bhubaneswar-Howrah Janshatabdi Express will not run between February 17 to 20.         
	The other cancelled trains include the Howrah-Puri-Howrah Garib Rath Express, which was supposed to leave Howrah on February 16 and 18 and the Down trains, scheduled to leave Puri on February 17 and 19.

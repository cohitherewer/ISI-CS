                                                                                                               Campus rocked by   form-and-fee fracas

	Admission of first-year students to Bhawanipur Gujarati Education Society College was disrupted on Thursday as around 2,000 applicants held a demonstration alleging irregularities in the system.        
	The students blocked Elgin Road  on which the college is located  for an hour, from 11.30am. The protesters alleged that they were lathicharged by police but officers denied the allegation.        
	The agitating students later gheraoed the house of Mangaldas Singhvi, the chairman of the society that runs the college, and raised slogans demanding transparency in the admission process.        
	The students alleged that the college authorities were selling seats at a premium and had abruptly stopped distribution of admission forms to ensure that only those who had paid a hefty sum were taken in.         
	Heena Gorsia, the secretary of the society, rubbished the charge, saying: The students who are being denied admission have failed to meet our criteria.        
	Sources said the distribution of admission forms, which started well before the declaration of the Plus-II results, was stopped on Wednesday.        
	I came today to submit my admission form but the authorities are refusing to accept it saying it did not bear the signature of Mangaldas Singhvi. It was just an excuse... the management is accepting the forms of those who have paid a premium, said Avishek Singh, a student who joined the blockade.        
	Sukhvir Singh, the father of an applicant, said that following the authorities advice, he had brought a bank draft for Rs 20,000 to get his daughter admitted to the college.        
	She has fulfilled all the criteria but the college is still refusing to take her in, said Singh. Its apparent the authorities are selling the seats to the highest bidders.        
	Gorsia countered: The students and their parents should understand that buying admission forms does not guarantee admission. Its not possible to admit all those who have been issued forms. Only the deserving candidates will be taken in.        
	Some college officials said most of the students who took part in the protest had bought the forms before their Plus-II results were announced but did not opt for provisional admission.        
	Its the colleges policy to give priority to those who have taken provisional admission. Those who had not opted for it are now demanding that they be admitted just because they had bought the forms. The demand will not be accepted, said an official.

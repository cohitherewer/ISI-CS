          RITH BASU                                  SIEGE SAGA: Actors Dhritiman Chaterji and Raima Sen, who will present the Mumbai terror attack anniversary events at St Xavier rsquo;s. Telegraph pictures               
	The old boys of St Xaviers Collegiate School will commemorate the first anniversary of the Mumbai terror attacks with a medley of music, words and images, presented by Raima Sen and Dhritiman Chaterji.        
	The programme, named A-shanti, will feature songs by Tagore (in Bengali as well as Hindi and English translations) and Bob Dylan and readings from his works and those of Leo Tolstoy, Martin Luther King Jr and Mahatma Gandhi, said Anirudh Kajaria of Alsoc (Alumnorum Societas), the alumni association.        
	The songs and readings will be interspersed with footage of the Mumbai siege on a giant screen and scenes from films like The Ten Commandments, Ben Hur, Taare Zameen Par and Pearl Harbor.        
	Raima and Dhritiman will be the narrators of the 105-minute programme, to be held on the school premises exactly a year after 26/11.        
	The fight for peace is a never-ending one and Id take part in any event which promotes it. Also, Id never turn down an invitation from my old school. Id like to take this opportunity to express solidarity with people from across the border whore facing an ordeal every day, said Dhritiman.        
	The other performers will include Pramita Mullick, Neel Adhikari and Sounak on vocals and Alokananda Roys dance troupe.        
	In our first meeting after 26/11, there was shock and anger among members. We decided that we needed to do something concrete, said Noomi Mehta, the honorary secretary of Alsoc. There was a consensus that the works of great men would help people come to terms with the loss and voice protest.        
	Fr George Podonath, the rector of the institute, lauded the initiative. I feel very proud that the old boys have taken up this issue. More such efforts are needed across the country to reach more people and build awareness against such cowardly acts, he said.

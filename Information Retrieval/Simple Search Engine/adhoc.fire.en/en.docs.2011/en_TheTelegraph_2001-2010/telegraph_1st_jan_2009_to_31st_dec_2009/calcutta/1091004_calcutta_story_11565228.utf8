The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A landscape of artificial furs; a toy-monster 
                                                                                                               A landscape of artificial furs; a toy-monster 
										      Eyewitness                        A work by Dipta Bhattacharjee				                                 
	It would not be far-fetched to write that it is one of the best shows of young artists, mostly from Bengal, one has seen in recent times.         
	There are participants from abroad, too, as in most GenNext shows. The quality of their works this time is exceptional.         
	There are just enough works on display to engage the attention of viewers, instead of, as in previous years, them having to watch their step inside the gallery for fear of stumbling on art work strewn all over.        
	A wide range of materials, technologies and formats have been used and the mood ranges from funny to risque. Even more outstanding is the fact that these are all very young artists for whom this is the very first break.         
	There is a touch of humour that may make some viewers feel hot under the collar in Atul Mahajans sculpture of the flaccid prophylactic in red that gets an erection the moment a viewer stands on the plank stretching across the floor. If one looks carefully, engorged, it actually comes closer to a rhino horn rather than something more obvious. It is bound to catch ones eye for more reasons than one.         
	Most of the sculptures are worth a second look or even more. Dipta Bhattacharjee turns artificial fur in garish colours into landscape and a cuddly toy that could be a monster. She creates an extreme form of pastoral beauty in viridian that perhaps Marie Antoinette would have loved.         
	Amit Kumar Debnaths woman is in full bloom, quite literally, and she stands on a single lions paw like a precious piece of furniture.         
	Nantu Behari Dass sculpture was always meant to appeal to ones tactile sense. This time fibreglass and lead types add up to create humanoids devoid of emotion, their apparent infancy notwithstanding. There is something sinister about children with frozen features, skin bristling with spikes.        
	Understatement is the primary appeal of some of the works. Mansoor Alis etchings on mirrors with black or blood red surfaces are elegant without being decorative.         
	Romicon Revolas acrylic and print on canvas demonstrates how images that have the potential of being turned into an advertisement can be transformed into art work by paring off the banality of hard sell. Culture should be handled with care. Partha Guin finds the correlative of this statement in his box of crackers made of international culture icons. The gallery has avoided the temptation of going to town.       SOUMITRA DAS

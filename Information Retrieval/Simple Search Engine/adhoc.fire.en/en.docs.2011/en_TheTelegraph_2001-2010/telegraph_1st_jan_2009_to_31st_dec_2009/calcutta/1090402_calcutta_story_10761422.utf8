The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | First day, first show
                                                                                                               First day, first show
          ANASUYA BASU                                            
	One hundred and eighty days after Ratan Tata announced the pullout from Singur, three Nanos rolled in from Pantnagar in Uttaranchal and became the talk of the town on April Fools Day.        
	This troika  all silver and all Lunar Silver Nano LX, the top-end variant  was exclusively for display but others are on their way for test drive and display at more outlets around town.        
	The first look of the Nano  available in Calcutta for an on-road price ranging from Rs 1,54,668 (Nano STD Solid) to Rs 2,10,047 (Nano LX Metallic)  drew curious onlookers and serious buyers alike on Wednesday.        
	Metro drove to all three Nano stops  in a Maruti 800, Indias cheapest car on the road today  to take a closer look at the cheapest car in the world.        
	9.30am. Lexus Motors, AJC Bose Road.        
	A sizeable crowd of onlookers peered into the glass-enclosed showroom, off the Shakespeare Sarani crossing, as cleaners worked on the silver body for the perfect shine.        
	On special request, the Nano rolled out for a quick spin on AJC Bose Road. All of 3,099mm long and weighing 600kg  against the 3,335mm long Maruti 800 weighing 683 kg  the pint-sized car turned out to be a real traffic stopper.         
	Ei dekh, dekh... Nano! was the cry on AJC Bose Road even in peak hour traffic.        
	Soon after the Nano was back in its park-and-preen spot, the shadow of Singur  around 42km away  crept up in the form of two Trinamul supporters raising slogans against the 1-lakh car being sold for 1.5 lakh followed by a large posse of policemen to guard the small car.        
	So what brought so many to the AJC Bose Road showroom? The reasons ranged from first car dreams to second car drive.        
	Hena Navait, 30, who works in a share brokerage firm, could not conceal her excitement. I am learning to drive just so that I can drive a Nano. Its a beautiful car that will help many women.        
	Policeman Subrata Banerjee represented a vital target audience for the Nano  the two-wheeler man for whom it meant a streetcar named affordable desire. I have a Hero Honda bike. I was on duty here so I decided to check out the Nano. I like it very much and hope to buy one.        
	Unicef employee J.R. Naidu, 53, was there to check out a prized gift for his son. I drive a WagonR but am planning to buy a Nano for my 24-year-old son who is an IT engineer. It looks good and I am impressed with the space inside. But I will be back for a test drive before deciding.        
	11am. KB Motors, Ballygunge Circular Road.        
	The thoroughfare in front of the showroom was chock-a-block with vehicles. A flex outside heralded its arrival. Here too the silver Nano was parked right in the middle of the showroom. Here too the visitors ranged from must-see to must-buy.        
	I own a Santro and might buy a Nano as my second car. I like the tall boy design and I find it quite spacious; the boot space is the only if, said businessman Sheikh Mubarak Hussain, 37.        
	Gaurav Shah, the 28-year-old owner of a car accessories shop had no doubts about the Nano being great for city driving and as a second car. He suggested body graphics, alloy wheels, sun film and parking sensors to jazz up the look.        
	Noon. RD Motors, VIP Road        
	The last of the three Nanos rolled in here. A ring of serious buyers checked out the car while asking for all technical details. The queue for forms grew longer by the hour.        
	I have already bought a form. I own a two-wheeler but I can afford this car. Its quite spacious but with the engine in the rear, will the car become too hot? wondered Nazrul Nanda, 42, a Jessop employee.        
	And so the first day of the Nano show saw hope and hype in Calcutta, barely 40km from where the car was meant to roll out of.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Black Cats land at airport base
                                                                                                               Black Cats land at airport base

	If Cobra has slithered into Lalgarh to neutralise the Maoist threat, the Black Cats have slipped into Calcutta to set up a quick-reaction counter-terrorism camp.        
	A 25-acre plot belonging to the Airports Authority of India at Kaikhali, a bullet shot away from the southern end of the runway, has been handed over to the National Security Guard (NSG) to set up barracks and other facilities for 200-250 personnel.        
	The first batch of commandos is already in town and is staying at Salt Lake stadium. Two more are scheduled to arrive by Tuesday. They will officially start operations on July 1, though it could be a while before the Kaikhali camp becomes functional.        
	The choice of plot defines the NSGs priority after the Mumbai attacks  be close to an airstrip so that time isnt lost in transit. Kaikhali was just what the NSG was looking for, said a home department official.        
	Commandos of the NSG had taken nine hours to reach Mumbai from their base at Manesar during the terror attacks on November 26. The Black Cats travelled to Delhi by road before boarding a flight to Mumbai. Manesar does not have an airstrip, and that resulted in time being lost. The NSG obviously doesnt want a repeat, the official said.        
	While the operational base for Calcutta will be Kaikhali, the Eastern Regional Centre of the NSG is likely to be on the citys outskirts. A team of NSG officials was here a few weeks ago to look for land to set up the regional centre. We showed them around 1,000 acres in Kanchrapara. The modalities are being worked out, a senior IPS officer said.        
	The 7,500-odd Black Cats are trained for close-quarter encounters, air strikes, emergency evacuation, anti-hijacking operations and counter-terrorism. They are also experts in defusing bombs and improvised explosive devices. The anti-terror unit, called the Special Action Group, almost exclusively comprises personnel drawn from the army. Paramilitary personnel constitute the Special Ranger Group, which handles VIP security.        
	It isnt clear how the NSG will operate in the four cities  Mumbai, Chennai and Hyderabad are the other three  but sources said personnel trained at its Manesar base would initially be stationed at the quick-reaction camp. The regional centre, once it comes up, will train more commandos for future deployment.        
	The centre will have long and short-range firing grounds and other heavy-duty training facilities. That is how the NSG operates  constant training and performance evaluation, said an officer overseeing NSG operations.

                      Classical concoction                    There was a time, even in the Nineties, when classical musical soirees were a regular feature of the citys cultural calendar. However, there was a lull and city connoisseurs of classical music and dance were deprived of their staple diet. Hence, a two-day concert of Indian classical music and dance, hosted by Sangeetam and Beams, is like a whiff of fresh air, providing music lovers of the city a splendid opportunity to witness the performance of veteran masters and upcoming artists alike. This evenings programme features a Bharata Natyam recital by Rama Vaidyanathan and Dr N Rajams violin recital. Trained under icons like Yamini Krishnamurthy and Saroja Vaidyanathan, Rama Vaidyanathan is one of Indias leading young exponents of Bharata Natyam. Violinist Dr Rajam, of course, needs no introduction. She studied initially with her father, Arupathi Natesa Iyer, before training with renowned vocalist Omkarnath Thakur. Tomorrow at 9.30 am: Hindustani classical vocal by young, versatile artiste Mahua Chatterjee to be followed by a solo tabla recital by Pandit Kumar Bose. At 6:30 pm: Sugato Nag will present a sitar recital. The concluding programme will feature khayal by Pandit Rajan Mishra and Pandit Sajan Mishra.                    Event: Programmes of Indian classical music and dance When: Today at 6.30 pm and tomorrow at 9.30 am amp; 6.30 pm Where: G.D. Birla Sabhagar

                      Hope and realism                    Art is a symbolic expression of life and is thus shrouded in mystery, concealing within itself several layers of meaning. However, unlike the works of modern artists, whose art may be subject to constant re-interpretations, the works of Maitreyi Banerji are in most cases clear and accessible. No painting by her is controversial enough to be at war with itself or with art critics. Never lacking in freshness, her paintings seldom bog down the viewer in a glut of details. To common art gallery visitors, her frank and direct renderings are a relief, releasing them from the tyranny of abstract understanding. The messages conveyed through her paintings are reflective, but never wry or cynical. Hope shines through the haze of even the most grim and melancholy of her works. In her paintings, the medium is not the message, but the content is. A natural artist, a gifted watercolourist, an inspirational art teacher and a prolific painter with an unquenchable thirst for excellence, Banerji always retained faith in lifes sundry events. She found epic grandeur in the life of common people and portrayed it with great sensitivity. The ongoing exhibition of a selection of paintings from her lifes works showcases images that are local in theme but universal in spirit.                  Event: An exhibition of paintings by Maitreyi Banerji When: Till April 3; 3 pm - 8 pm Where: Academy of Fine Arts, New South Gallery

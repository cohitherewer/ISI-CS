                                                                                                                 We Ask You Answer      Stern action needed for raggers 
          Todays question: Should the college authorities go soft on raggers? More responses will be published next week                    Relatives of ragging victim Aman Kachroo take part in a candle light march in New Delhi. (PTI)

	Ragging is nothing new. Even 30 years ago, ragging in hostels was common but never life-threatening. Now, ragging sometimes violates human rights. There is no point in going soft on raggers as the effect of ragging on most students is trauma. The authorities should conduct seminars to impress upon students the baneful effects of ragging.                Ahana Sen Gupta ,

	Ragging has become a social evil. The college authorities should be strict against raggers and should not hesitate to take decisive steps. Students come to study in the city colleges from other cities and even remote areas. Raggers have no to right to torment and instil fear in such students, especially because they dont have a support system in place. The college authorities should provide proper guidance and legal support to the victims of ragging and urge them to continue their studies. Raggers should be punished severely.

	The authorities should not go soft on raggers. The college authorities, teachers and guardians should be present at the programmes to welcome freshers organised by the senior students. Ragging can be prevented in this way. Generally, senior students rag their juniors because they were ragged when they joined college.                Indranil Sanyal

	Harsh punishment should be meted out to raggers to set an example. The death of Aman Kachroo, a 19-year-old medical student who suffered multiple head fractures and brain haemorrhage while being ragged by seniors at a Himachal Pradesh college, was shocking. Despite that, management student Akhil Dev was severely injured during a ragging session at his college in Chennai. Devs head was repeatedly banged against the wall, which resulted in damage to his retina. This kind of inhuman brutality has to be stopped. If the college authorities go soft on the offenders, the crimes will continue.                 Shounak Banerjee, 
  Baranagar         
	The college authorities are there to make the right decisions at the right time. It is not about being soft or hard on raggers. The reaction of the authorities should depend on the incident. Ragging within limits is healthy but can be dangerous if it goes out of control. College authorities should keep ragging in check by setting guidelines.

	The college authorities should not go soft on raggers. At present, ragging is an offence and anybody involved in it or supporting it should be punished. Students go to colleges to study, and not to suffer grievous physical and mental damage. Ragging can be done in a friendly manner to build friendship with newcomers. But the raggers often cross the line.     Kajal Chatterjee, 
  Sodepur   
	Far from going soft, the college authorities should not only suspend those accused of ragging but also expel them if the charge is proved. The authorities should make sure they cannot enrol themselves in any other college in the country. Raggers can also be handed over to police so that they are awarded exemplary punishment by the court of law.

	Raggers should be dealt with strictly. It is shameful that freshers are being subjected to inhuman torture by their seniors for the sake of fun. Victims of ragging get psychologically scarred at the start of the most significant phase in their lives. I dont see any reason for the college authorities to go soft on raggers. Anyone who rags should be expelled or severely reprimanded.

	Ragging is an inhuman act. It has ruined the lives of many students. The college authorities should not go soft on raggers. In fact raggers should be given severe and exemplary punishment. This is the only way to stop ragging. Making laws against ragging but not implementing them will only encourage wrong-doers.There is no room for any debate on this issue.                 Pramit Maity
  Girish Park									      
	Ragging is an offence. I think this practice should be eradicated from our education system. It does not help anyone to achieve anything. It happens only in developing countries like India and not in the developed countries like the US, Canada and Japan. I think the college authorities must penalise raggers.                Samita Pal, 
  Kalindi         
	The college authorities should be stern towards the raggers. This cruel act not only ruins a students mental and emotional stability but also his academic career. Ragging should be treated as an unpardonable crime because sometimes it even leads to suicide.

                                                                                                               Bike gang loots bank
  - Robbers herd hostages into vault, flee with Rs 25 lakh          A STAFF REPORTER                          The Baguiati bank  the door of the locker room circled in red  from where Rs 25 lakh was looted on Monday.   Picture by Amit Datta                                      
	Six armed men robbed a bank of Rs 25 lakh after knocking the lone, unarmed guard unconscious and herding the staff and customers into the empty vault before fleeing.         
	Soumitra Roy, 42, walked into the Baguiati branch of Indian Overseas Bank around 1.45pm on Monday to withdraw cash and was greeted by an eerie silence.         
	 Imagine walking into a bank and finding not a soul there. It spooked me out, he told Metro.        
	Roy, who had a fleeting glance of the robbers on two motorcycles before he had entered the bank, realised what had happened when he heard a thumping sound from behind the iron door to the vault. I turned the wheel knob and there were 15-odd people inside, some of them injured and all of them in shock.        
	The hostages included manager V. Raman, who was in his chamber when the gang of six had entered the bank around 1.30pm with countrymade pistols. Three of them trained their guns on me and asked for the keys to the vault. When I refused, they kicked me off my chair and snatched the keys, a police officer quoted him as saying.        
	One of the robbers was keeping an eye on guard Md Sharif Ali, unconscious after being hit on the head with a revolver butt. The other two asked the customers and the rest of the bank staff  in Bengali  to lie on the floor with their hands on their heads. Anyone who looked up was assaulted. Two customers were injured, the police said.        
	After stashing the cash into two bags, the robbers told the bank employees and customers to get up and walk single file towards the vault. They completed the operation in just 15 minutes, Amitabha Nag, one of the two injured customers, said.        
	Rakhi Dey, a homemaker who lives in the five-storey apartment block whose ground floor houses the bank, was feeding stray cats when she noticed the robbers rev up their motorcycles and head towards Sahapara. They were carrying two black bags. One of the motorcycles was brown and the other red, she said.         
	Deputy inspector-general (CID) Sanjay Mukherjee said identikits of the robbers were being prepared on the basis of the accounts of witnesses.        
	No bank official was available for comment.        
	This comes within a week of three youths robbing Rs 30 lakh from the unguarded cash room of a biotech companys office in the citys central business district.

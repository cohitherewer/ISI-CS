The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Result signals CU seat crunch
                                                                                                               Result signals CU seat crunch
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The results of BA, BSc and BCom Part-III examinations under the 1+1+1 pattern of Calcutta University (CU) were declared on Thursday. With over 99 per cent successful candidates, the results may lead to a seat crunch in the CU masters programmes.         
	The pass percentages stood at 99.68, 99.35 and 99.34 for arts, science and commerce (honours) respectively this year.        
	In 2008, the figures were marginally higher in all three streams  99.8, 98.89 and 99.62 in arts, science and commerce, respectively.         
	We are happy with the results. But those who have scored below 60 per cent may find it difficult to secure a postgraduate berth, said Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee, the CU pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs).        
	Nearly 36,000 students have passed the Part-III exams this year of whom 4,423 have scored above 60 per cent. There are around 6,000 seats in the MA, MSc and MCom courses offered by CU.         
	The crisis of seats is likely to be felt most in the commerce stream.        
	There are 900 seats in MCom, while 2,090 students have scored 60 per cent and above in BCom Part-III.         
	The trend is not new. We have noticed an improvement in the performance of students after the 1+1+1 system was introduced, a CU official said.         
	A large number of students do not opt for postgraduation. But we will try to ensure that a willing first-class graduate is not deprived of a postgraduate seat, said the official.         
	BA, BSc and BCom Part-III (major) exam results were also declared on Thursday.

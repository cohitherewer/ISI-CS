                      Gems of Indian art                    Since the dawn of the 21st century, the contemporary art scene in India has become as varied as never before. Though artists continue to be influenced by historical traditions and folk styles, the emergence of newer forms and styles can also been found which cannot be categorised into any specific existing artistic genre. Despite the fact that contemporary Indian artists take inspiration from various sources and styles, Indian art still retains its distinct Indianness. nav-Ratna, the ongoing group exhibition of art works by eminent, veteran artists, bears testimony to the rich, immense variety and creativity in the field of the visual arts. Featuring paintings, drawings, etchings and lithographs, it celebrates the virtuosity and genius of its nine participants, each of whom has distinguished himself throughout his long, illustrious career. Participants: K.G. Subramanyam, Akbar Padamsee, Jogen Choudhury, Suhas Roy, Prokash Karmakar (a painting by him appears here), Dipak Banerjee, Kartick Chandra Pyne, Sunil Das and Shuvaprasanna.

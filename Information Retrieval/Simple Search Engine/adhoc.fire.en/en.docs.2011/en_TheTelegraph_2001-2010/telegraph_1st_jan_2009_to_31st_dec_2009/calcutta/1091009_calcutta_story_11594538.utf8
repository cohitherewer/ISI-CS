                      Ode to the five elements of life                    In the Bible, there are a number of references to clay and pottery wherein humankind is compared to clay and God is equated with the potter, who creates and moulds complex beings from a simple lump of earth. Yet, Lord, thou art our Father; we are the clay, and thou art our potter (Isaiah 64:8). Clay as a medium is mystical and philosophical to work with, insists Aanupamaa G Jalan, a studio potter, whose initiation to this medium began in 2000 in Calcutta . Jalans intention is to keep to functional objects used universally by people across the globe. To her, pottery is a creation of a vocabulary of form and surface touched with contrast. It radiates a universal spirit, and that is the spirit she wants to express in her works. Her treatment focuses on softness, the way in which clay can take up an imprint and be manipulated and transformed into reality. It always denotes continuity of life. Her range of work leads from simple, organic forms to those which are bulbous and yet elegant, solid as well as porous, floral yet linear, lavish and restrained  which all go in establishing her skill at mimicking different thought processes. Often covered in varied hues, these forms evoke emotion. Her utility tableware work has graduated over the years and now culminates in an impressive range in varied shapes, designs and colours, many of them inspired by nature. At times she accessorizes her ceramics and tableware with a touch of metal. She has also created a dazzling range of candles which is aesthetically pleasing as well as utilitarian and just perfect to usher in the festival season.

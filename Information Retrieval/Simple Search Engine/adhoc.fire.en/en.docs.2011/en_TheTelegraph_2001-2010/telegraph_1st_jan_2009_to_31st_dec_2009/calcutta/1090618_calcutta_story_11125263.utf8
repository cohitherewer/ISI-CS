The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rain yes, but not monsoon flow
                                                                                                               Rain yes, but not monsoon flow

	A thunderstorm lashed the city on Wednesday evening, offering rare respite from the swelter, but the weatherman was quick to point out that this was not monsoon rain.        
	What we experienced in the evening was a thunderstorm typical during the monsoon. This would bring only temporary relief, for a few hours at the most. The normal monsoon flow is still 48 to 72 hours from activation, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	The thunderstorm lasted about two hours between 5pm and 7pm, lowering the temperature by three to four degrees Celsius and pushing the minimum humidity down around 10 per cent.        
	The average windspeed was around 50-60km per hour, peaking at nearly 70km per hour. From 6.05pm to 7.06pm, flight operations had to be suspended at the airport. Eleven flights hovered for 40-45 minutes on an average, waiting to land, an airport official said. At least 10 aircraft waiting to take off were put on hold.        
	Circular Railway services were hit and there were reports of disruptions in the Sealdah-Ranaghat sector.        
	A giant scaffolding put up for the renovation work in block II of Great Eastern Hotel came crashing down. Several cars were damaged but no injuries were reported.        
	A tree in front of Victoria House at Esplanade also came crashing down on some parked cars. Another 14 trees were uprooted in various parts of the city, disrupting traffic on Rabindra Sarani and Harish Mukherjee Road.        
	Before the storm hit in the evening, the city had sweated through yet another hot and humid day, with the mercury touching a maximum of 37.6 degree Celsius, four points above normal. The humidity ranged between 92 per cent and 59 per cent.        
	Calcutta will have partly cloudy sky over the next 24 hours, with the possibility of rain or thundershower towards evening or night, said the weatherman.        
	According to weather analysts, the monsoon flow will not be activated before June 20. Current meteorological analysis and numerical weather prediction models indicate strengthening of the monsoon surge with the formation of a low-pressure area this weekend over north Bay of Bengal, said a senior official of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) from Pune.        
	Once the revival takes place by June 21-22, one can hope for medium to heavy rainfall that one associates with the monsoon, he added.

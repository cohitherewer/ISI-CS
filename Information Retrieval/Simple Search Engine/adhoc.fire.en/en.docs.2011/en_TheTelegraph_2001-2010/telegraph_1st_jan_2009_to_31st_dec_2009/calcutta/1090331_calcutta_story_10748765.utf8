The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Youth held for online fraud
                                                                                                               Youth held for online fraud
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The 24-year-old son of an iron scrap trader in Howrah was arrested on Monday for allegedly duping a credit card holder of Rs 64,182 by booking air tickets online.        
	Sumit Agarwal, a commerce graduate from a north Calcutta college, had accessed the Internet using the GPRS-enabled cellphone of an acquaintance, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of the detective department.         
	In India, GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) is a data transmission service used to surf the Net on a cellphone.        
	The youth, who was arrested on Shakespeare Sarani on his way to meet friends, did not run a travel agency but was known to offer air tickets at a discount.        
	Pramod Mahapatra, the credit card owner, had lodged a complaint with the police after receiving his monthly statement. He found a number of air tickets were booked using his credit card number without his knowledge, said an officer of the detective departments cyber crime wing.        
	With the help of the airlines and the Internet service provider, investigators tracked down the cellphone that was used to buy the tickets. The owner of the phone was picked up. He told us that Sumit had used his phone to book the tickets, added the officer.        
	During interrogation, Agarwal broke down and confessed to the crime. He is yet to disclose how he found out the particulars of Mahapatras credit card, said an officer. Some other complaints of air tickets being fraudulently booked online using GPRS have been lodged with the detective department. Sleuths suspect Sumit was behind some of the cases. We tried to trace the owners of the cellphones but the SIM cards were issued against false addresses, said an officer.

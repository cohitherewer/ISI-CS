                                                                                                               Autonomy for tech colleges
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          Sudarshan Ray Chaudhury    
	Private and government engineering colleges in Bengal are set to enjoy more autonomy.        
	The state government has decided to grant more academic, financial and administrative freedom to the state-run engineering colleges for their upgrade and smooth functioning, higher education minister Sudarshan Ray Chaudhury said on Thursday. He was addressing the annual convocation of the West Bengal University of Technology (WBUT), to which the private engineering colleges are affiliated.        
	Vice-chancellor Sabyasachi Sengupta announced that the university had decided to grant academic autonomy to select colleges for running postgraduate courses.        
	According to the minister, the management structure of government engineering colleges will be changed so that they can enjoy more academic and financial freedom.         
	The government hopes that more autonomy for state-run engineering colleges will result in more industry-academia interaction. Participation of industries has become extremely important for the running of engineering institutions. The All India Council of Technical Education has suggested that the government increase the involvement of industries in engineering institutions. We are taking steps in that regard, said the minister.        
	The government granted certain financial and academic freedom to four out of eight government engineering colleges that were selected for the World Banks funding under its Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme.        
	There is a lack of qualified and experienced faculty members in private engineering colleges in Bengal as well as other parts of the country. The WBUT is directing its efforts towards improving postgraduate education imparted by the affiliated colleges so that they can produce efficient engineering teachers, said Sengupta.        
	We will maintain close watch on the colleges teaching MTech courses. The affiliations of institutions that do not perform up to the desired standard may be cancelled, added the vice-chancellor.        
	E. Sreedharan, the managing director of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation and the chief guest at the convocation, suggested that the university tie up with the East-West Metro project so that students could gain practical knowledge.

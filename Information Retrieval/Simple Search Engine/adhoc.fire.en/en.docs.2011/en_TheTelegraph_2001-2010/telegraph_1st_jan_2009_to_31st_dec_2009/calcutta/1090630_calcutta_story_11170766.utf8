The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Buddha prod for vertical growth
                                                                                                               Buddha prod for vertical growth
  - CMC proposal to modify building rules and allow highrises catches CM eye          A STAFF REPORTER                          Metro report on June 22 on the height hurdle                                        
	The city centre has taken a step towards greater vertical growth with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee urging his municipal affairs minister and his law minister to fast-track the new building rules drafted by Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC).        
	The proposal  with a key component being that the CMC be allowed to sanction highrises on regular-sized plots in the central business district  has been lying idle at Writers Buildings from last December.        
	Metro had on June 22 reported how the modification of the building rules could add five million square feet of commercial floor space to the citys prime business areas within two-three years, and add around Rs 200 crore to the civic coffers annually.        
	Following the prod from the chief minister, municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya will return from Siliguri this week and meet law minister Rabilal Moitra to take stock of the revision of building rules.         
	We are not demanding any special privilege. The CMC had this power till 1984. There is no reason why the municipalities should enjoy discretionary powers to allow highrises  following an amendment in 2007  while the CMC continues to be denied that, said an officer in the law department of the CMC.        
	At present, the civic body cannot allow a building on a regular-sized plot to rise beyond five-six floors. Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, who has apprised the chief minister of the urgent need for change, said: This will add a lot of commercial space. The owners of tenant-infested unsafe buildings and of rundown private markets can also be offered better packages for reconstruction.        
	The stunted vertical growth of Calcutta is crippling its commercial potential, added the CMCs director-general of buildings, Gora Chand Mondol. It is impossible to expect growth of trade and commerce when the space is already saturated and there are such rigid restrictions on vertical growth.

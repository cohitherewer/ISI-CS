The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bitter lessons for schoolchildren
                                                                                                               Bitter lessons for schoolchildren
          
	The environment in and around most schools in the city is hardly conducive to learning. Metro lists the problems outside some schools              
	La Martiniere for Girls        
	Problem: Blaring horns drown out the voices of the teachers at the Rawdon Street address. Starting from 7.30am till 1.20pm when the school gives over, classes are held amid continuous honking. Classes V to VIII, in Lawrence Building, are the worst hit.        
	Impact: It is impossible to hear the teacher if we are sitting on the last few benches, said Class VI student Krittika Ray. Every morning between 7.30 and 8, members of the schools Nature Club stand on the pavement holding no horn placards. Car owners listen to our plea but their drivers dont, said Sakshi Sureka, a club member.         
	Who is to blame: Traffic police for allowing the honking. We prosecute drivers but most of the honking takes place when the school starts and gives over, said Dilip Banerjee, the deputy commissioner of police (traffic).         
	We will chalk out an action plan soon, said Biswajit Mukherjee, the member-secretary of the state noise monitoring panel.        
	Official word: We are in touch with the pollution control board and the police. No-horn zone placards have been planted in front of the school, but there has not been any noticeable change, said principal H. Peacock.        
	Akshar        
	Problem: An unpaved, uneven road leads to the Diamond Harbour Road school, where regular and differently abled students study. It is muddy in monsoon and so dusty in summer that some children are forced to wear masks.        
	Impact: Students fear tripping while walking to school. My wheelchair often gets stuck in the mud, said Class V student Parijat Banerjee.        
	Who is to blame: Calcutta Port Trust, under whose jurisdiction the road falls. I have been asked by the deputy chairman to look into the matter, said A.K. Mehra, the land manager of CPT.        
	Official word: We have approached CPT but they have not repaired the road yet, said principal K. Khullar.        
	St Marys Orphanage and Day School         
	Problem: Hawkers have encroached on the pavements adjoining the Dum Dum Road school.        
	Impact: Walking from Dum Dum station to the school is very risky as the footpath has been taken over by hawkers, said a Class VIII student.         
	Who is to blame: The public works department, under whose jurisdiction the road falls, and South Dum Dum municipality, in whose area the school is located.        
	We have just assumed office. We will discuss the problems with the administration, police and the PWD, said Prabir Pal, the Trinamul Congress councillor of ward 14.         
	PWDs version: We tried to remove the hawkers but faced resistance from the residents and the municipality. Cleaning the area has to be a joint venture by the PWD, administration and the municipality. We need to decide if the hawkers can be relocated, said a PWD official         
	Official word: Both the PWD and the municipality are mute spectators to the daily chaos in front of the school. The hawkers must have political backing, or else why were they not removed? said a senior teacher of the school.         
	Loreto Day School         
	Problem: The footpath leading to the school on Lenin Sarani is packed with hawkers. The noise from the road disrupts academic activities.        
	Impact: We cant hear lectures if the classroom windows are opened, said a student.         
	Who is to blame: The Calcutta Municipal Corporation. I had complained to the police. Cops often conduct raids and remove the hawkers but they return after a few days, said local councillor Sheela Kapoor.        
	Official word: Dharamtala is the hub of political meetings and rallies and the vehicles plying on Lenin Sarani honk in front of the school, said principal Sister Mercy. Hawkers display their ware on the window railings and cook on the pavement, so we cannot open the windows of the chemistry laboratory facing Madan Street, said principal Sister Mercy.        
	Jhinuk Mazumdar and Subhajoy Roy

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The city is all set to expand its fleet of swanky buses this New Year. The buses, to be bought under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) scheme, are expected to arrive by the second week of January, transport minister Ranjit Kundu said on Tuesday.        
	The Calcutta State Transport Corporation (CSTC) is running 60 buses under the JNNURM scheme and will introduce 40 more by the second week of January. Around the same time, the Calcutta Tram Corporation (CTC) will start plying 100 buses, Kundu said. This will be the first time the CTC will operate buses under the JNNURM scheme.        
	The minister said 2,500 buses and minibuses had been taken off the road when the ban on old commercial vehicles came into effect in November. Of these, 448 were replaced with regular buses and 293 with JNNURM buses.        
	He added 2,618 taxis and 11,508 autos had been replaced till date.        
	Speaking on pool cars, Kundu said: Pool car owners will have to register their vehicles as commercial vehicles and obtain a special permit. These cars will have to display a logo.        
	The minister added Maruti Omni vans would not be allowed as pool cars.

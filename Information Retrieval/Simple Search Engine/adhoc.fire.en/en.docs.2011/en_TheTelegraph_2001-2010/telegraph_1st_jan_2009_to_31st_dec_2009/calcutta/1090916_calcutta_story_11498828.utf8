The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Captains at ease at any crease   A leader and a host
                                                                                                               Captains at ease at any crease     - Kapil Devs day out at school, Sourav Gangulys day in at studio          RITH BASU AND PRIYANKA ROY                          Kapil with a student at The Heritage School.   (Anindya Shankar Ray)                                                  
	Kapil Dev strode out for the toss on Tuesday afternoon. Not to call heads or tails, but to toss the coin. Not in whites, but in a blue-and-white striped shirt and grey trousers. Not cheered on by his team but by some students and teachers.        
	Sourav Ganguly was calling the shots on Tuesday afternoon. Not setting the field for the next ball, but setting things right for the next shot. Not in whites, but in a grey pinstriped suit. Not flanked by his team-mates, but by Tollywood stars.        
	Indias only World Cup-winning captain spent Tuesday on a school campus and Indias most successful captain did so in a TV studio. Both were at ease at the crease.        
	In Sourav city, Kapil spoke of him during his day out at The Heritage School. Answering Nandini Ghosh of Class XII, the all-rounder who retired in 1994, said about the batsman who hung up his boots in 2008: He gave his best years to the Indian team and did extremely well. Now he has moved on.                  Sourav with Prosenjit at the quiz show shoot.   (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)       
	That Sourav has was apparent on the sets of his popular quiz show Dadagiri, at the HMV studios on Jessore Road, where he was busy playing host to special guests led by Prosenjit. Gently advising the star  Thanda mathay khelben (keep your cool) Bumbada  or shouting out instructions to his crew  Ekhon break newa cholbe na (No break now)  he was clearly in charge.        
	If Sourav spent four hours playing a different game with the stars, Kapil had quite a ball with the students for five hours on campus off the Bypass.                                
	From inaugurating a mini golf centre to inspecting the campus, from flipping the coin for a 15-over match to mimicking the baritone of a teacher, Kapil was, well, Kapil.        
	From urging the kids to excel in their chosen fields  so that you give away autographs rather than ask for one  to underlining the virtue of teamwork  without it the World Cup could never have been won  he was spot-on with each delivery.        
	If Kapil was an inspirational leader on Tuesday, Sourav was a hands-on host  from adjusting the brightness on Ranjit Mullicks plasma screen to rushing backstage to bring in the prizes.

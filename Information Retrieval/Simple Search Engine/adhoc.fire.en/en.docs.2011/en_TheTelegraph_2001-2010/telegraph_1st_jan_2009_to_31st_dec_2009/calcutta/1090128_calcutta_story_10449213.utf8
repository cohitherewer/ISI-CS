The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hooch cry in deaths
                                                                                                               Hooch cry in deaths

	Five persons died in Mahestala on Tuesday, allegedly after consuming spurious liquor.        
	State finance and excise minister Asim Dasgupta, however, said only two persons had died and denied that hooch was the cause.        
	Following unconfirmed reports attributing the deaths to hooch, the minister said he had asked the excise department to conduct a probe and submit a report, possibly by Wednesday.        
	The deaths sparked protests, with a mob pulling down several illicit liquor dens and setting some ablaze. Local CPM MLA Mursalin Mollah said all five died after consuming spurious liquor.

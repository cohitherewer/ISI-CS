                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Busted: Rs 5cr car racket
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The owner of a city-based travel agency has been arrested in Patna on the charge of duping more than 100 people of around Rs 5 crore.        
	Rajiv Gupta, who also owns a car showroom in Patna, is being brought to the city. Sleuths have recovered the Tata Indica of an armyman, which Gupta had illegally sold in Bihar.        
	Damayanti Sen, the deputy commissioner of police (detective department), said Gupta and his associates had opened a travel agency  M/S Trancity Travel Co. Ltd  on Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road early this year.        
	They announced that if anyone bought a car by taking a bank loan and let it out to the agency, they would pay the equated monthly installments as well as pay the owner Rs 10,000 to Rs 25,000 a month, depending on the make of the car, said Sen.        
	Aloke Jana, an armyman, approached the agency in January. He brought a car and handed it over to the agency, which gave him cheques for two EMIs and paid him Rs 22,000 for two months. Jana bought two more vehicles and handed them over to the agency. He was assured of Rs 19,000 and Rs 25,000 a month for the two cars. But in March, he received neither any cheque nor the monthly payment, said an officer of the detective department.        
	Jana went to the agencys office and found it closed. He tried to call Gupta and his associates but could not get through to them. Jana then lodged a police complaint.        
	The sleuths traced Gupta to Patna. A team went there in September and recovered an Indica that another armyman had handed over to the agency. We could not arrest Gupta then. A second team was sent following a fresh tip-off and Gupta was rounded up on Monday, said the officer.        
	A probe revealed that the racket had taken cars from more than 100 people and sold them by forging documents. We suspect the agency duped the victims of Rs 5 crore, said Sen.

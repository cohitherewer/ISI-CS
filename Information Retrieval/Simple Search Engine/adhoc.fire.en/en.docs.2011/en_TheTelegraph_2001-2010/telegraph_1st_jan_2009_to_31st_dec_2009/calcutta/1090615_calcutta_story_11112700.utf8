                      Into the heart of darkness                    Watercolour is a medium that can be as demanding and temperamental as those who choose to paint with it. But it is a colourful and exciting medium all the same  well suited to describing the many moods of the subject, as well as those of the artist wielding the brush  Jean Burman.        Veteran artist Shyamal Sens favourite medium of expression is watercolour. Sens paintings are all about light. In contrast to other media, the effects of light are not painted. They are revealed. That is to say, in transparent watercolours available light reflecting off the artists painting surface is what creates the sense of luminosity. The artist leaves the white of the background material, or tints it in various ways, providing value contrasts, setting up colour relationships and allowing colours to blend. Taken together, these brush strokes reveal the moment, character and effect of light. Sen uses his brush to communicate with his inner self and with the natural world around him. Force, dynamism and lyricism are the salient features that he brings out through his treatment, thereby unfolding the mystery dormant in life and nature. Transforming the common aspects of nature into multi-layered mysterious objects remains the essence of his paintings. In most cases, when he achieves this goal, his works glow radiantly.                  Event: Recent watercolour paintings of Shyamal Sen

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Plea plan against Sourav school
                                                                                                               Plea plan against Sourav school
  - Residents fear congestion          A STAFF REPORTER                          Bound for court: The CA block plot                                         
	Residents of Salt Lakes CA block on Sunday decided to move court against the school being built in the area by Sourav Ganguly.        
	The CA 222 plot, spread across 63 acres between Salt Lake School and Haryana Vidyamandir, was recently leased out to the former India captain by the urban development department. Residents fear construction of a third school in the area will lead to pollution and congestion.        
	We have formed a six-member panel and are planning to seek a stay on the construction of the school, said Rajat Moitra, the treasurer of the CA Block citizens association after a two-hour meeting between members.        
	The cricketer had met residents of the block last Wednesday in an attempt to resolve the issue. At the meeting, Sourav had promised to stop construction two weeks till the matter is resolved through talks. But he did not keep his promise and construction is on, added Moitra.        
	We will approach the state government under the Right to Information Act to find out the price of the land and the way it was allotted to him, said another resident.        
	The residents had earlier staged a demonstration and approached Bidhannagar Municipality and urban development department officials to stop the construction but with little success.        
	Souravs relative and a member of the schools administrative body, Sanjay Chatterjee, said: The residents have not informed me about their decision to move court. We have been trying to carry on with construction causing as little disturbance to the residents as possible.

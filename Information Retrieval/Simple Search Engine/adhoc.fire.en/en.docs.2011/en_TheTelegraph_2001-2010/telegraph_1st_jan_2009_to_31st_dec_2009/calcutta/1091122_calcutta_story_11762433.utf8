The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Lasting dander
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Lasting dander
                              Michael Longley. (Pabitra Das)                            
	Last week, a delegation was in Calcutta to promote Queens University Belfast. It brought one of Irelands foremost poets to town, who is also the current Ireland Professor of Poetry, which entails residencies at universities including, Queens.         
	No, he is not Seamus Heaney, but Heaneys contemporary and close friend and is spoken of in the same respectful breath as his Nobel Prize-winning peer. Michael Longley carries his accomplishments  Whitbread Poetry Award, Hawthornden Prize, TS Eliot Prize  lightly.         
	On his first visit to India, the 70-year-old is jovial, chatty, tired but eager to take in life bursting at the seams.        
	Seated in a city hotel, he talks of the mornings expedition to the Botanical Gardens in Howrah to see the banyan tree. It looks as though it is walking very slowly across the landscape. To Langley, it is a symbol of the perseverance of ancient culture.         
	He calls himself old-fashioned. I believe in the Muse, in waiting for poetry to come. That is why despite the stimulus of being in strange places, he is unsure if his next poem will be on India.         
	But the mornings trip did inspire a line. There is this lovely dialect word in our language, dander. It means to stroll. I thought of The everlasting dander of the banyan tree. If the line branches out into a poem, it will take a succinct form. Chattiness destroys poetry. Poetry cant exist without compression, says the poet who regularly prunes his lines. He has an imagery to describe his belief. Prose, he says, is a river. Poetry a fountain. A fountain is shapely yet free-flowing. In free verse, you miss the shape.         
	Life in Ireland amid three decades of ethno-political conflict since the 1960s, Longley says, induced poets of his generation to write about what is called The Troubles.         
	But the poet is not like a journalist. It takes time for things to settle to an imaginative depth. There is a notion in Ireland that civic unrest is good for poetry. I think that is a repulsive idea as is the idea that art must provide solace to people. Poetry cannot set out to be relevant. Most of the poetry that came out of Vietnam, he feels, is rubbish. We have a term for it  Troubles Trash. He quotes war-poet Edward Thomas: Anything, however small, may make a poem, nothing, however big, is certain to.        
	Perhaps his own poem The Ice Cream Man is an example. It deals with the death of an ice-cream seller, who had a shop in the same Belfast street where Longley stays. He was killed by the IRA. Later, I got a letter. It was signed: the Ice Cream Mans mother. It means more to me than all the good reviews.         
	Both Longley and Heaney recently turned 70. We took part in a concert. I wonder what theyll do when we turn 80, he guffaws.        
	I live for the next poem, he says. Longleys wife Edna, accompanying him on the tour, is a critic (the best, he mutters, grudging and gloating). Had it not been for her, my oeuvre would have been three times in volume. His most acclaimed poetry  including the award-winning Gorse Fires (1991) and The Weather in Japan (2000)  came after eight years of silence. Middle age is not good for poetry, he feels.        
	For his India tour he is reading an anthology of Indian poetry. The poems seem attached to the Romantic tradition in English literature but I dont feel qualified to pass judgment yet. But he has found out that potato comes to its own in Indian cooking. I cook Indian food at home, says the corpulent chef.                    SUDESHNA BANERJEE

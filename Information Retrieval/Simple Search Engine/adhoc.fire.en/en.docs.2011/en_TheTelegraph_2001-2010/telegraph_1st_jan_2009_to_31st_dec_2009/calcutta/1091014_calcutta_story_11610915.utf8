	Some passengers of the Shri Jagannath Express from Puri were robbed on their way to Howrah early on Tuesday.         
	GRP sources said four passengers on AC and sleeper coaches were robbed of cash, cellphones, credit cards and other valuables while they were asleep. The gang boarded the train before Kharagpur and jumped off the running train, said a GRP officer.

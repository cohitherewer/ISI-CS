          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	London residents Saurangshu Sekhar Wadedar, 35, and his 10-year-old daughter Sanjukta have tested positive for swine flu. They flew to the city from London on Saturday and were sent to Infectious Diseases Hospital, in Beleghata.        
	Both were running a temperature but their condition had improved, said a hospital official. They will be given Tamiflu tablets and kept under observation for the next few days.        
	The father-daughter duo are the third and fourth swine flu cases detected in the city. We were given beds in different parts of the hospital but I moved into my daughters cabin, said Wadedar, who works in a law firm.        
	Flu tests: The National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases in the Beleghata hospital compound received permission from the Centre on Monday to conduct swab tests for swine flu, said an official of the institute.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Nod for organ law change
                                                                                                               Nod for organ law change
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	The state government will give its nod to the Centres proposal to amend the Human Organs Transplants Act and include grandparents and grandchildren in the list of near relatives who can donate organs.        
	State health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra announced this in the Assembly on Tuesday and expressed hope that the proposed amendment would increase availability of organs for patients suffering from renal failure or some other terminal illnesses.        
	A large number of such patients, Mishra pointed out, do not survive because there are inadequate donors.        
	The minister also announced that the government would take steps to boost organ harvesting from the brain dead.        
	The Bengal governments response to the Centres proposed amendment to the Human Organs Act, 1994, follows a letter from the Centre to all states seeking their views on the issue. The proposed amendments include a proposal allowing grandchildren and grandparents to donate organs as near relatives.        
	Under the existing law, an organ can be donated by a near relative (parents, children, spouse, siblings) or by someone whose only motive is to save a life.        
	In the first category, a series of medical tests are conducted to establish that the donor and the recipient are near relatives.        
	The second category of donors, apart from undergoing medical tests, have to face an ethics committee of the government.        
	The panel meets twice a month to interview donors and recipients. Both sides have to declare that money will not change hands before or after the transplant.        
	The transplant racket still thrives because declarations are often false and there is no foolproof method to detect fraud.        
	Minister Mishra said inclusion of grandparents and grandchildren in the list of near relatives will not only take the steam out of the racket but also save more lives.        
	As many as 1.5 lakh people need kidney transplantation in our country every year but donors are too few. There were only 2,000 donors in 2004 and 3,600 in 2002, he said. The problem can be solved if there are more organ harvest from the brain dead.        
	Trinamul Congress MLA Partha Chatterjee said all necessary precaution should be taken before organs are harvested from grandparents. The Medical Council of India should frame a guideline.

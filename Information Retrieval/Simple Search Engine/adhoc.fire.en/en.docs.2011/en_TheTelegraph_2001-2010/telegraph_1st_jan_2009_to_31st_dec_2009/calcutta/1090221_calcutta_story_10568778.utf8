The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CU extends deadline
                                                                                                               CU extends deadline
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta University (CU) has fixed two fresh dates  February 26 and 27  for filling up forms for the BA, B.Sc and B.Com Part II and Part III examinations after many students missed the February 12 deadline. The decision was taken at a meeting of the CU syndicate on Friday.        
	Around 700 students from colleges across the city had been demanding an extension after they missed the deadline because of a communication gap.        
	We will look into why there was a miscommunication between the colleges and students, said Suranjan Das, the vice-chancellor.        
	The syndicate has also decided to form a review committee to monitor administrative and financial aspects of 10 self-financed postgraduate courses run by colleges affiliated to CU.        
	The committee has been set up to step up vigil on the colleges. There have been reports of irregularities in matters like fees, number of seats and syllabus completion, which will be looked into by the committee, said Das.

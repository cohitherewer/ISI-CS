The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Two sides of the celeb divide
                                                                                                               Two sides of the celeb divide
          
	THE AFTERGLOW

	Everybody wanted a change this time. People were tired of what was happening, especially in Nandigram and some suburbs. The Trinamul has won on its own merit. The party mattered more than its candidates. I am a huge fan of Mamata Banerjee. She has always been there for a cause and has always stood beside everyone, whether a celebrity or a footpath-dweller.                        
	Bratya Basu
  Theatre actor-director  
	The face people opted for is Mamata Banerjees. I believe it is more a loss for the CPM than a victory for the Trinamul. It has been the defeat of arrogance, mediocrity and megalomania. Those who have won have a lot of responsibilities. I hope that the winds of change continue to blow till 2011. I expect Trinamul to pay attention to the overall development of the state.

	The Opposition will become more enthusiastic and united before the Assembly elections. I wont be surprised if the Left slowly disintegrates. Manmohan Singhs popularity has worked in the Trinamuls favour. If the party sticks to the Congress its chances of winning the Assembly elections will improve.                     
	Bibhash Chakraborty
  Theatre director         
	Like most people, I wanted change and that has come about. From daily wage earners to officers, all those who took part in the Singur and Nandigram agitations, deserved change. We wanted to jolt the Left Front and make it irrelevant at the Centre. If the trend continues there might be further change. It will depend on how both the ruling and Opposition parties conduct themselves over the next two years.                           
	Shaoli Mitra
  Theatre actor-director         
	People wanted change and have expressed uncertainty about the current Bengal government. Those who come to power will have to facilitate the change. Who sits on the throne is not our lookout, we have protested against anything that is wrong. We want things to be fair for all and the Opposition can achieve that by not repeating the mistakes of the ruling party.                
	THE AFTERMATH                        
	Arindam Sil
  Aactor        
	I dont see this as a defeat of the CPM; people have voted for a stable government at the Centre and not for Mamata. This will be proved in the Assembly elections. The people of the country will soon understand what they have done. Last year, the Trinamuls attendance in the Lok Sabha was only 17 per cent. If they are for the people, as they claim, then I sincerely hope that they spend some more time in Parliament!                          
	Anindita Sarbadhicari
  Telefilm-maker        
	In democracy, the other side of victory is defeat. I feel depressed but the defeat is not a local phenomenon. There has been a sweep for the Congress across the country. I dont take it as an anti-Left mandate but a countrywide vote for stability. The Left should definitely sit down and take stock of what went wrong. Im a supporter of the Left since they always admit mistakes and go back to the people.                           
	Rudranil Ghosh
  Actor        
	I think people got carried away. They voted for the Trinamul because they didnt want to vote for the CPM. Besides, this is the Lok Sabha poll, lets wait for the Assembly elections. I dont think Calcuttans are deeply affected by what happened in Nandigram and Singur. With the CPM in power, we walk on the streets devoid of fear. I am not sure if we will continue to do so if the Trinamul comes to power in the Assembly elections.                           
	Sabyasachi Chakraborty
  Actor        
	People have decided to give another party a chance. Lots of factors have led to this decision. There has been a lot of misinformation about the Left trying to take over land. Plus, there has been minority cross-voting. I think the Left has been getting wrong feedback from the grassroots. The sudden withdrawal of support from the Centre may also have been reflected in the results.                          
	Mrinal Sen
  Film-maker        
	The loss can be good for the Left Front in a way. They should think about the mistakes they have been making. The future will be tough and we all know why.

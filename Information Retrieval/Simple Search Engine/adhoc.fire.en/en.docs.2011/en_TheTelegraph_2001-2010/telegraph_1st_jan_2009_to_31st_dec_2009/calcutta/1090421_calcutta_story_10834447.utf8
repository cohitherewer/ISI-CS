The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Relax amp; play after studies

	For most students, there is little scope to relax after school. Alphaville, a tutorial institute launched on April 15, claims to change this. While providing academic guidance to students from preparatory to Class X, according to the ICSE syllabus, it will also include after-study activities like yoga, games, quizzing and debating.         
	Students are too saturated with information by the end of the day to take it in any more. Here, study will be intermixed with breaks, said Sujata Dey, director, Alphaville. The coaching institute, located at 18 Dover Road, has made participation in recreational activities compulsory.         
	Classes will begin with meditation and breathing exercises. Students will be taught using audio-visual aids and mind-mapping, where diagrams are used to represent complex ideas.         
	Other activities include a weekly kids club, with quizzing, debating and dramatics. After every class, students will have a session for indoor games, like scrabble, table tennis and carom.         
	Classes begin in May with a starting fee of Rs 800 per month, varying according to classes and choice of subjects. We also plan to provide coaching to underprivileged children and the mentally challenged in future, said Dey.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pension relief for 80-yr-old after 28 yrs
                                                                                                               Pension relief for 80-yr-old after 28 yrs
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	A high court order on Thursday came as a reprieve for an 80-year-old woman who has been running from one office to another for the past 28 years for family pension.        
	Justice K.J. Sengupta asked the treasury department in Kalna sub-division of Burdwan district to clear the pension dues of Gayatri Goswami within 12 weeks.        
	The amount due to the woman  at one-third of the salary last drawn by her husband per month  is around Rs 1,44,000.        
	Goswamis husband, Rajendramohan, was an assistant teacher at Kurumba Junior High School (Now Purba Gopalpur SMP Vidyapith) at Burdwans Kanaidanga Uttarpara village when he died on May 15, 1969. His salary was around Rs 900.        
	The petition submitted by Goswami states that the school, privately owned when Rajendramohan joined as assistant teacher on January 2, 1960, became a state-aided institution in 1981.        
	According to rules, teachers of state-aided schools are entitled to pension and other benefits, such as provident fund and gratuity.        
	The families of teachers who die in service are entitled to family pension.        
	Rajendramohans widow got her provident fund and gratuity dues but not the family pension. She met the director of school education in Calcutta, who sent her to the district council of school in Burdwan, said the petitioners lawyer, Idris Ali.        
	The lawyer said that since the school became an aided institution, the widow had been moving from one office to another and got only assurances.         
	She moved the high court a month back.        
	My client had to face great hardship to bring up her only child. The paltry amount she received in 1982 as the provident fund and gratuity dues of her husband was her only source of sustenance, Idris said.        
	The lawyer appearing for the state government, however, claimed that the education department had taken steps to ensure that the widow got her pension but the Kalna treasury was delaying in disbursing the amount.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Nip not winter
                                                                                                               Nip not winter
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The nip in the air over the past week should not be mistaken for winter which is still at least two weeks away, the Met office said on Sunday.        
	The minimum temperature is likely to drop to around 18 degrees Celsius in two weeks or so, marking the onset of winter, said an official of the Pune-based India Meteorological Department.        
	The minimum temperature over the past few days has been around 20 degrees Celsius, two degrees below normal.        
	Strong easterly and east-northeasterly winds are active over the Bay, keeping the weather comfortable in south Bengal, the official said.

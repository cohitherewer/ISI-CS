The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Class IX girl dies on campus
                                                                                                               Class IX girl dies on campus
          OUR BUREAU                              
	A Class IX student of a south Calcutta school collapsed on campus on Tuesday morning and died before receiving medical attention, raising questions about the preparedness of educational institutions in tackling emergencies.        
	Vedika Goyal of Class IX C at Ashok Hall Girls Higher Secondary School, off Minto Park, was declared dead on arrival at Belle Vue Clinic around half an hour after she was spotted gasping for breath and collapsing near the water filter in the first-floor corridor.        
	She was brought in around 9.30am. We suspect she suffered a cardiac arrest, the CEO of the hospital, Pradip Tandon, told Metro.        
	Belle Vue is less than 200 metres from the school.        
	Vedika, 15, had undergone open-heart surgery in March last year to repair a damaged valve but had apparently recovered well to lead a normal life. Until Monday, she had been practising hard at the Rabindra Sarobar stadium along with other students for a school festival.        
	She fainted while walking towards the filter on the first floor. The vice-principal rushed upstairs and saw her vomiting and gasping. So we took her to Belle Vue, said principal Patralekha Ghosh.        
	Classmates said Vedika might have been under physical stress after the month-long practise under the blazing sun for Spectrum, a festival of the Ashok Hall Group of Schools held every four years.        
	But the teenagers father R.K. Goyal did not blame anyone for the incident, insisting that his daughter died a natural death triggered by her heart condition.        
	Vedikas body was taken to the Goyals rented house at 21C Jatindra Mohan Avenue, in north Calcutta, around 1pm. Classes at Ashok Hall were suspended for the day.         
	Friends described Vedika as a quiet but active girl. She was the younger of the Goyals two children, the elder one being a son.        
	While some students and parents said that the punishing schedule of classes and extra-curricular activities might have taken its toll on Vedika, for most guardians the larger issue was the lack of trained medical attendants on school campuses.        
	 A school must have at least one teacher who should be trained in emergency medicine and resuscitation methods. We had approached several schools to send teachers for such training but the response was poor, said Apurba Ghosh, the director of the Institute of Child Health.        
	According to doctors, epilepsy, asthma and other forms of respiratory distress are common among children in the city. Each of these can be fatal if medical care is delayed by even a few minutes. At least one teacher in each school must undergo training in cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, management of acute asthma, convulsion, injury and other emergency medical situations. Its standard practice across the world, said Ghosh.        
	Some private hospitals do run health check-up programmes for select schools but there are no round-the-clock facilities. We offer occupational health centres to companies where there is a doctor, a nurse and an ambulance always on standby. We can provide such services to schools, too, said Rupali Basu, the CEO of Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals.        
	Some guardians of Ashok Hall students, in shock over the Vedika tragedy, felt that it was time to take stock of the torture inflicted on children in the name of Spectrum.        
	Satadal Saha, a city-based general surgeon, whose two daughters study in Ashok Hall, threw in a note of caution: Before a child joins the strenuous outdoor drill that comprises practise for the event, the authorities should conduct a comprehensive medical screening.

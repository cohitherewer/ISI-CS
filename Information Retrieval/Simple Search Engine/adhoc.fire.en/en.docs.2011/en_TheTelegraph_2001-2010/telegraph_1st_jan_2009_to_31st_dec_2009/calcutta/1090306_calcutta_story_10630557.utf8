The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Unsafe factories ravaged by fire
                                                                                                               Unsafe factories ravaged by fire
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Fires broke out in two factories in Howrah on Thursday, damaging goods worth lakhs. Firefighters doused the flames before they could spread to other units or adjacent houses. No one was injured.        
	A preliminary probe revealed both factories lacked firefighting preparedness.        
	Prafulla Kumar Dutta, the Howrah divisional officer of the fire service department, said: We will lodge police complaints against the factory owners. They have not installed even the basic fire-prevention measures.        
	The first fire broke out in a dye factory at Jalan Complex in Jangalpur at 4.30am. The unit was stacked with chemicals, which fed the flames.        
	Six tenders fought the blaze and brought it under control at 8.30am. The cause is yet to be ascertained as there were no workers in the factory when the fire broke out. The security guard of another factory in the complex spotted the flames and informed the fire brigade. Fire officers suspect the blaze originated in a factory furnace.        
	The second fire was reported from a plastic factory on GT Road, under Shibpur police station, around 3.30pm. The adjacent houses and a school next door were evacuated as a precautionary measure.        
	According to the workers of the unit, the fire broke out in the store and spread to the first floor.        
	The fire brigade has started a probe. A fire brigade officer said: The factory, stacked with inflammable materials, had not taken any safety measure. I do not know how the owner managed to get a trade licence.

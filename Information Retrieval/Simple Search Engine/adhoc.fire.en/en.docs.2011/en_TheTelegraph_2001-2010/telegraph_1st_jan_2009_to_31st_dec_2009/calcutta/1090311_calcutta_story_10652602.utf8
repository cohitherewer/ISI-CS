The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | JU staffer guilty of paper leak
                                                                                                               JU staffer guilty of paper leak
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	A non-teaching employee of Jadavpur University (JU) has been found guilty of leaking the question paper of the BA Sanskrit entrance test last year, sources said.        
	An inquiry committee set up in September 2008 to probe the allegations of a leak found the employee guilty and submitted its report to the JU executive council on Monday. The authorities have decided to take action against the employee.        
	The punishment, however, is yet to be decided as some members of the council felt certain aspects of the case needed to be probed further.        
	The panel has been asked to submit the clarifications within a month, a source in the university said.         
	The university will take a final decision after the committee submits its second report, said Siddhartha Dutta, the pro-vice chancellor.         
	A section of teachers, however, claimed that some members had delayed the process of punishing the employee as he was a member of the CPM-backed JU workers union.        
	In August 2008, students of JUs arts faculty had lodged a complaint with the authorities alleging that the BA Sanskrit question paper had been leaked. They said a non-teaching employee had sold photocopies of the paper.        
	According to the complaint, a teacher of the Sanskrit department had asked the employee to photocopy a printout of the question paper. He allegedly made more copies than required and sold the extra ones for a hefty sum.        
	In 2008, around 500 students had applied for BA Sanskrit, which has 40 seats.

The Auer String Quartet was formed in 1990 by four students of Budapests Ferenc Liszt Academy of Music. Invited by the Royal Academy of Music in London, the ensemble attended the Amadeus String Quartets quartet courses from 1991 to 1995, as well as those directed by distinguished violinist Gyrgy Pauk. The Auer String Quartet has won many prizes in numerous Hungarian and international competitions, including first prize at the 1991 Leo Weiner Chamber Music Competition at the Ferenc Liszt Music Academy. The quartets most important breakthrough came in 1997 when it was awarded first prize in the 7th London International String Quartet Competition, with Lord Yehudi Menuhin as jury chairman. The quartet also won the Special Audience Award and the Sydney Griller Trophy for the best interpretation of a contemporary composition. Since then, the Auer String Quartet has established itself internationally, collaborating with many distinguished guest soloists, including Mikls Pernyi, Paul Meyer, Tams Vsry, Zoltn Kocsis, Steven Osborne and Peter Frankl.

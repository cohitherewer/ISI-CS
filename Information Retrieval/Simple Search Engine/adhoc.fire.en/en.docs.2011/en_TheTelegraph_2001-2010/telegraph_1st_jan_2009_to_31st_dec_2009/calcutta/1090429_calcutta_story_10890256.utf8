The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Blade slash in court 
                                                                                                               Blade slash in court 
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A 29-year-old undertrial, accused of possessing narcotics, brought out a blade from his mouth and slashed his hands and neck at the Alipore court on Tuesday.         
	The incident happened at 3.30pm when Budhiya Dass case was being heard by Narendra Rai, the fourth additional divisional magistrate. During the hearing, Das suddenly pulled out the blade and slashed it across his hand and neck while standing in the dock with co-accused Akash Maity.         
	Blood started spilling out of Dass wounds and the hearing was suspended. Cops took him to SSKM Hospital, where he was treated and sent to Alipore central jail, where he was lodged.        
	The police said Das, a resident of Behala, was arrested in June 2007 with a few grams of ganja. The trial began in end-2007. On Monday, Das protested against the delay in the trial and wanted to know why he was being denied a bail. He then pulled out the blade, hidden under his tongue, and slashed himself.

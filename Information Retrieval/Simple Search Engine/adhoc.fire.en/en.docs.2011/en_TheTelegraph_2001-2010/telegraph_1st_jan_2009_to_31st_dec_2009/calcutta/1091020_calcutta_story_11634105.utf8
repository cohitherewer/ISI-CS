                                                                                                               Building work norm
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Municipal commissioner Arnab Roy issued a circular last week directing the building department to ensure that houses are built, repaired or painted only after covering the outer walls with plastic sheets.         
	Complaints from city residents prompted the directive, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.        
	The civic building rules advise builders and owners to cover the outer walls of houses where construction work is on with plastic sheets but few do so in the absence of monitoring.         
	According to the civic building department, over 12,000 buildings in the city are under construction or undergoing repairs at any given time.

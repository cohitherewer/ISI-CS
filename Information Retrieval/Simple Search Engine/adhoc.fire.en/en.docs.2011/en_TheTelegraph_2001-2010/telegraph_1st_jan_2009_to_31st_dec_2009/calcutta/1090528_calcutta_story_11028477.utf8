The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Nigerians arrested for SMS fraud
                                                                                                               Nigerians arrested for SMS fraud
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two Nigerians, who allegedly defrauded a Calcuttan of over Rs 1.2 lakh by sending her a text message stating that she had won 200,000 in a lottery, were arrested in Delhi on Tuesday.        
	The two, identified as Anthony Obinwa and Ernest Uchenna Ughabugo from Isiozi in Nigeria, were key members of a racket that had cheated people across the country by sending such text messages and emails, claimed police.        
	A laptop with a data card and five cellphone handsets were seized from them.        
	Investigators said the Nigerians were held on the basis of a complaint by Sunanda Banerjee, a resident of Narkeldanga Main Road.        
	She had received an SMS in March stating that she was the winner of a lucky draw organised by a multinational company among cellphone users across the world. Sunanda responded by sending an email to an address mentioned in the message.        
	The duo told Sunanda that a diplomat from the UK named Ben John Kennedy would reach Delhi shortly and hand over 200,000 to her. They even sent her a winners certificate and scanned photographs of a passport supposedly belonging to Kennedy, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of the detective department.        
	Anthony and Ernest claimed they were in Delhi and gave Sunanda a cellphone number to communicate with them. Once they became sure that she had fallen into their trap, they asked for a processing fee of nearly Rs 70,000. The duo then asked for a customs clearance fee, said an investigator.        
	A Calcutta police team left for Delhi seven days ago to arrest the duo.

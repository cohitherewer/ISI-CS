	Shaw Public School, Behala, stepped into its third year with celebrations on Thursday and Friday.         
	All 600 students of the girls school took part in the programme, which started with a procession by members of the four houses  Emerald, Ruby, Sapphire and Topaz, representing Earth, Fire, Water and Sun, respectively. A prayer session followed.        
	The ceremonial lamp was lit by the guests of honour, film-maker Aniruddha Roychowdhury and his wife Indrani.        
	Education teaches you where you come from and where you ought to go. Its important to have a dream and then follow it to completion, said the film-maker.        
	Pritha Basu, of Class VIII, said: We worked hard for this and are excited to perform before such a large audience. I am not nervous at all.         
	The main attraction was a play on protecting the environment, staged by Kolkata Sanved, an organisation that tries to heal people through dance, along with students and faculty of the school.        
	The teachers performed the rock classic Winds of Change, and dedicated it to the guests of honour.         
	A performance by city band Friends of Fusion brought down the curtains in the evening.

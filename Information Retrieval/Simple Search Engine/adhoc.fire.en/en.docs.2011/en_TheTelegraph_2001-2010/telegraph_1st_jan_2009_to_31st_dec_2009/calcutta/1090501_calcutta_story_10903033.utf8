                      Bohurupee 61                    Generally acknowledged as the leading group of the new drama movement that rejuvenated Bengali theatre in the 1950s, Bohurupee was founded in 1948 by several active members who left the Indian Peoples Theatre Association (IPTA). With stalwarts like Manoranjan Bhattacharya and Sombhu Mitra at its helm, Bohurupee was always distinctive in conception and presentation of plays, at the root of which lay intense study and thought, disciplined practice and preparation, adherence to the idea of viewing a production as a collective endeavour, integrated artistic creation and, above all, loyalty to theatre. Over the years, Bohurupee has acquired a rich and diverse repertoire of productions, including original plays and adaptations, classical and contemporary productions. To celebrate its 61st anniversary, the group is hosting a three-day festival of plays beginning today. To be staged today: Beerja Sulka (3 pm) and Kaalsandhya (6 pm; a scene from it appears here). Todays programme will also include the launch (by Mrinal Sen and Sankha Ghosh) of a photo album with images from Bohurupees productions over the last 60 years, as also of some rare pictures of legendary theatre personalities. Tomorrow: Nisidhha Thikana (3 pm) and Deepadanda (6.30 pm). The concluding day of the festival will feature Chhanch Bhanga Murti (3 pm) and Phulla Ketur Pala (6.30 pm).

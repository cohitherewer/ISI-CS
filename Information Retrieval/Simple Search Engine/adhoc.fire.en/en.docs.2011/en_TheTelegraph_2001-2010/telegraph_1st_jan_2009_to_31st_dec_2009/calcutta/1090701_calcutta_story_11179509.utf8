The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Minister backs Sourav school
                                                                                                               Minister backs Sourav school
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Sourav Ganguly                                  
	Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya met the two joint secretaries of the CA block residents association on Tuesday afternoon to allay their fears about Sourav Gangulys school coming up in the area.        
	The local councillor, Ila Roy, also attended the meeting at Unnayan Bhavan, which lasted about 20 minutes.        
	The association alleged that the school, coming up on the 63-cottah CA222 in violation of the township master plan, would lead to congestion and mishaps in the primarily residential area.        
	The plot handed over to Sourav was earmarked in the master plan for an educational institution. I tried to address the concerns of the residents. I even showed them documents to prove that there were no irregularities in the procedure, the minister said after the meeting.         
	I have appointed an urban planner to find ways to avoid congestion in the area. I will meet the residents again after he submits a report, added Bhattacharya. The association had written to the minister against the project.        
	Rajat Moitra, the treasurer of the association, said after the meeting that they would proceed with their plan to move court.        
	The plot was earmarked for a three-storeyed college, and not a seven-storeyed school, in the master plan. We have no problems if a three-storeyed college comes up on the plot. We will proceed with our plans to move court against the project, said Moitra.        
	Another member of the association said: We have nothing against Sourav Ganguly. In fact, we are his fans. But we will not allow his school to come up violating the master plan.

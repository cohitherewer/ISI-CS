The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Golf focus on grassroots
                                                                                                               Golf focus on grassroots
  - Project to churn out pros          SUBHRO SAHA                          A new programme will aim to find champions from the middle class like S.S.P. Chowrasia                                        
	Calcutta, home to the worlds second oldest golfing greens, will soon tee off a grassroots programme aimed at churning out more champions like S.S.P. Chowrasia from the middle rungs of the social spectrum in the next five years.        
	Vision 2014 will target the nearly 80 per cent of the citys youngsters who are neither very rich nor are poor caddie boys, giving numbers a chance to begin with and then, sharp-focusing on a select group to hone them into pros.        
	In sync with our philosophy of broadening the base of the pyramid, we want to catch that mass which now goes to cricket or tennis coaching camps, making it even cheaper to play golf, says Indrajit Bhalotia, the chief coach and director of Protouch, the golf academy launching Vision 2014.        
	The project has come up with a two-pronged strategy to scout for talented kids below 13 years of age. Ten top city schools are being approached by the academy for start-up lessons on campus, and a once-a-month talent-hunt scheme on the Maidan is expected to throw up more.        
	We are looking at a pool of 20 select under-13 children by December this year. They will then receive intensive training for two years, including video analyses, sports psychology, nutrition, yoga and conditioning. We hope they can be eventually absorbed by the IGU (Indian Golf Union) elite programme, says Bhalotia.        
	Lessons will come at Rs 500 per session, while the shortlisted score, who are expected to be tournament-ready by 2012, will pay at a subsidised rate of Rs 200 for two weekly lessons, irrespective of social status.        
	IGU, which is rolling out its own programme to catapult the city back to pole position in Indian golf through a centre of excellence and satellite facilities, is ready to support Vision 2014 in every way possible.        
	We do have constraints of space and are on the lookout for unused patches of green to create driving or chip-and-putt ranges. We are ready to partner the civic body or CMDA in this initiative. More public facilities would go a long way in ensuring success of a structured scheme like Vision 2014, IGU president Ashit Luthra tells Metro.        
	Protouch feels golf talent can come from aspirants in other sports like cricket and tennis as well. For instance, a decent batsman can potentially become a good golfer and vice-versa. So, we are also putting up posters of Vision 2014 at reputable cricket coaching clinics like Ashok Malhotras, and some tennis camps too, says Abhishek Ghosh, a coach in the golf academy.

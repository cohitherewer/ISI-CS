The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | HS mark hurdle for Joint seat
                                                                                                               HS mark hurdle for Joint seat
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT      
	More students have cracked the Joint Entrance Examination this year compared with 2008 but private engineering colleges are still unsure about filling up all their seats.        
	The doubt stems from the rise in the seat count and the decline in the number of Higher Secondary candidates scoring 50 per cent or more in physics, chemistry and mathematics  a must to secure a berth in an engineering college.        
	The names of as many as 60,000 students figure on the merit list of JEE 2009 (engineering)  the results of which were declared on Tuesday  against around 25,000 seats in government and private institutions.        
	The merit list for JEE (medical) has 1,797 names, against 1,107 seats.        
	Swarnabha Chattaraj, of Bankura Zilla School, topped the engineering list. The first slot in JEE (medical) has been bagged by Ahanjit Bhattacharya, of RK Mission Vidyalaya, Narendrapur.        
	Last year, the engineering merit list contained 45,000 names. But data from private colleges reveal that more than 100 seats remained vacant as only a handful of students who had ranked beyond 35,000 had scored 50 per cent or more in the three science subjects.        
	The situation can be worse this year, as the number of engineering seats has gone up by around 7,000. Add to that the fact that the number of students securing B grade (45-59 per cent) in HS 2009 has gone down by 1 per cent compared with 2008. Its unlikely that any student ranking below 40,000 will fulfil the criteria, said a senior official of a private college.        
	The seat count has gone up as around 20 more colleges are likely to get the approval of the All India Council of Technical Education this month.        
	Board chairman Siddhartha Dutta, however, allayed fears of more seats in the private colleges remaining vacant. Its too early to comment... but we hope the situation will be better as the overall performance of the JEE candidates has improved.        
	Echoing the chairmans view, a senior official of the board said the lowest mark in JEE 2009 (engineering) was 20 per cent, compared with 15 last year.        
	Sources in the West Bengal Joint Entrance Examination Board said the merit list contained more names than the number of seats as several students opt out of the race after failing to bag a berth in a college or course of their choice.        
	As for the budding engineers, many of those denied admission to premier institutions, such as Jadavpur University or Besu, or top-rung private colleges, tend to opt for engineering courses in other states. Some prefer to study a general course in science for a year and then reappear in the JEE.        
	The counselling for allotment of seats  to be held in three phases  will start on July 5.         
	Board chairman Dutta had a word of caution for students eyeing berths in the private colleges under the management quota.        
	Till last year, the colleges were allowed to reserve up to 10 per cent seats under the quota. But the high court has directed certain institutions to cut the quota count. Students should verify the exact number of seats a college can set aside for quota students, said Dutta.        
	The average tuition fee for a regular seat in a private college is Rs 43,000. For a quota seat, the minimum fee is Rs 1 lakh.        
	The board announced on Tuesday that JEE 2010 would be held on April 18.

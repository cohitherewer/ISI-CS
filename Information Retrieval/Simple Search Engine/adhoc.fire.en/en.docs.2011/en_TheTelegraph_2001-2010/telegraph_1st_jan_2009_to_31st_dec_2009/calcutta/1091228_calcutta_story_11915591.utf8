                      Simply ceramics        The word ceramics comes from the Greek   keramikos, meaning pottery, which in turn   comes from keramos, meaning potters clay.   Most traditional ceramic products were made   from clay (or clay mixed with other materials),   shaped and subjected to heat, and tableware and   decorative ceramics are still made like that. The   quality or type of ceramic art varies according to   the shape of the object, its decoration by paint  ing, carving and other methods, and the glazing   found on most ceramic ware. The Glaze, the on  going show of ceramic art works, features cre  ations by Delhi and Calcutta based artists. It pro  vides unique, original and durable home and gar  den pottery and accessories. Featuring more   than 100 ceramic objects that express themes   and details from everyday life, it has on show   functional ceramic wares including mugs, vases,   teapots, wall pieces and more.

	The owners of dud IT firm Infogen Global on Thursday blamed the global downturn for their failure to pay salaries to their 1,200-odd employees.        
	But the additional chief judicial magistrate of Salt Lake, Ramesh Kumar Pradhan, refused to buy the line and remanded the seven directors of the company in judicial custody till April 23. They were in police custody.        
	All seven have been charged with conspiracy, criminal breach of trust and forgery.        
	Thanks to the downturn, my clients did not get enough orders from abroad as well as from within the country. As a result, they could not pay their employees, the lawyer of Anirban and Debarchana Ghosh, two of the directors, submitted before the magistrate while seeking bail for the accused.        
	The lawyer even claimed the stalemate could have been resolved had the employees not turned violent, forcing Ghosh, the self-styled chief visionary of the company, and the other directors to flee.        
	The assistant public prosecutor countered the submission, saying there were enough evidences to prove the fraud and the directors involvement in it.        
	We have proof that the trainees were showed fake invoices, which the management claimed were issued by various firms, and asked to pay Rs 50,000 each as security deposit. Company officials had even taken out the hardware from the computers hired from a Salt Lake-based company, said the assistant public prosecutor.        
	The CID produced a long list of items the sleuths had seized from the seven accused.        
	Among the items were a number of cellphones, SIM cards, expensive cars, computers and laptops. We are scanning the laptop of a senior official in search of more details of the scam, said a CID official.        
	Around 200 former employees of Infogen and members of various student bodies gathered in front of the court, demanding a speedy trial and exemplary punishment for the accused.        
	The cops stopped the protesters, many of whom were carrying banners, at the gate and allowed only five to enter.        
	The government should take steps to reopen the company and ensure that we are reinstated. We also demand our dues, said Sayan Ghosh, a former employee.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Next weekend you can be at ...   Jamshedpur
                                                                                                               Next weekend you can be at ...   Jamshedpur
                                                
	Going to Jamshedpur was a home-coming of sorts. I was born in Jamshedpur but we had moved out when I was a toddler  so Ive no memories of the place.         
	A few hours journey by train brings one to Tatanagar  the Steel City of India. But what strikes the visitor is the cleanliness and greenery all around. I had heard that Jamshedpur is known as the Green City first and then the Steel City, thanks to its visionary founder, Jamshedji Tata.         
	Jamshedpur is surrounded by the beautiful Dalma Hills. Nestled at the foot of the hills is the vast Dimna Lake, about 11 km from the city. The scenic beauty is enchanting. The hills in the distance, the clear blue rippling waters and the greenery make Dimna Lake an ideal retreat for the metropolis-weary traveller. The lake has facilities for boating and water sports.         
	Within the city, there are many places of interest. Jubilee Park is a favourite haunt of the local people and tourists are also enraptured by the sheer beauty of the park spread over 225 acres.         
	The manicured lawns are dotted with branching trees like ashok, trimmed and well-shaped bushes, myriad- coloured flowers and fountains. At night when these fountains and cascades run with coloured lights weaving magical patterns on them, they have a mesmerising effect.         
	We also went to a laser show. The musical fountains and the laser show are quite a spectacle and we thoroughly enjoyed.                       
	The Hudco Lake in Telco Colony  with its lovely park, artificial waterfall and lake  is a popular picnic spot.         
	The devout can visit the many places of worship  Bada Masjid, St Georges Church and temples, including a Parsi temple. We offered puja at Bhubaneshwari Mandir, which is situated atop a hill with a motorable road. From here one can get a panoramic view of the city.         
	If one can manage to get permission to see the Tata plants, one must make the most of it. We were lucky to be shown around Tata Motors. The complex is meticulously maintained and is a pleasure to behold. We also visited the Centre of Excellence, which is a unique structure of angled buildings and huge columns, housing the Tata Steel archives.         
	We made short stops at the Keenan Stadium, XLRI, The Sacred Heart Convent School where my older sisters had studied and Beldih Club.         
	As we boarded the train for the return journey, I was filled with a sense of fulfilment at having visited my place of birth after so many years.  
	Going   
	Jamshedpur is 251 km from Calcutta. There are many trains like Janashatabdi Express, Tata Steel Express. Bus services are also available.   
	Staying   
	There are hotels to suit all budgets. Hotel Siddhartha is a comfortable, government-approved hotel on the main road. Ph: (0657) 2425435, 2433008.      (METRO ON SUNDAY THANKS

                                                                                                               Man held for killing wife
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 33-year-old man and his mother were arrested in Rabindra Nagar, South 24-Parganas, on Friday for allegedly killing his wife and dumping the body in a well.        
	Police said Tapas Das strangulated Mamoni on Wednesday evening, stuffed the body into a gunny bag and dumped it into a neighbourhood well. He then tried to cover the body with sand and cement.        
	Since the well is not used, residents of the locality had no clue about the body. Till late on Friday, cops and firemen were trying to drain out water from the well to recover the body.        
	Tapas admitted that he had murdered his wife. He and mother Sandhya would torture Mamoni as she failed to bring money from her parents. The mother has been arrested for helping Tapas kill Mamoni, said an officer of Rabindra Nagar police station.        
	Tapas, who collected samples for a local diagnostic centre, and his three-year-old daughter went missing on Wednesday evening. Mamonis parents launched a search for the trio. Tapas, along with his daughter, returned on Friday evening but failed to give satisfactory replies about his wifes whereabouts. Neighbours then informed the cops.

                                                                                                               Twin losses for SFI in varsity elections
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Arts students celebrate the poll results on Wednesday. (Sanat Kumar Sinha)                                  
	The Forum for Arts Students and We the Independent on Wednesday won the Jadavpur University arts and science faculty polls, respectively, but the SFI managed to wrest both posts for assistant general secretary (evening).        
	The elections in the faculties were held on Tuesday. The counting was completed on Wednesday without any incident though there was a skirmish between SFI and FAS supporters the previous evening.         
	The FAS, which won all the four seats for the past two years, retained the posts of general-secretary, vice-chairperson and assistant general secretary (day).        
	Arindam Dutta, a second-year history honours student, will be the new general secretary.        
	FAS supporters blamed the decline in the victory margin on low turnout. Many students, especially those in the evening section, did not vote, said Lokeshwari Dasgupta, a third-year history honours student who will become the vice-chairperson.        
	In the science faculty, the WTI hadnt lost a seat in the past four years. Its candidate Anirban De, a second-year student of zoology honours, will be the general secretary of the faculty union.        
	Our margin of loss has come down significantly from last year in the arts department election. It shows our organisational strength. Our aim is to win all the seats next year, said Anunoy Chakraborty, the president of SFIs local committee.        
	The SFI had failed to win a single seat in the engineering faculty elections of the university last month.

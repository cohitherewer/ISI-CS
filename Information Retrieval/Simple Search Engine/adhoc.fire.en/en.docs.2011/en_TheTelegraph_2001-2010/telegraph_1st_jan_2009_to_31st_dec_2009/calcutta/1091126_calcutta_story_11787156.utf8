	He was speaking after the first meeting of the mission, chaired by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, at Writers Buildings on Wednesday.         
	For a new house, the government will provide Rs 1 lakh and the beneficiary will have to pay Rs 20,000. For repairs, the government will pay Rs 50,000 and the beneficiary Rs 10,000, said Dasgupta. The municipalities will choose the beneficiaries.

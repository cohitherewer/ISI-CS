The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Training for tech teachers
                                                                                                               Training for tech teachers
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	West Bengal University of Technology, to which 71 private technology colleges are affiliated, has tied up with Wipro to train teachers in a bid to produce better engineers.         
	Over 15 per cent of the engineering teachers are not meant to teach. They may be highly qualified but that does not make them good teachers. Shortage of quality teachers tells on the employability of engineering students, said Sabyasachi Sengupta, the vice-chancellor of the university.        
	The 71 private engineering colleges affiliated to the university produce around 25,000 graduates and diploma holders every year. There is a question mark over the employability of many of them, according to industry insiders.        
	Mission 10X by Wipro is expected to improve teaching and learning practices in engineering colleges, said Sengupta at the recent launch of the programme in the state.        
	A five-day Mission 10X workshop for engineering faculty members was attended by teachers from Jadavpur University, Heritage Institute of Technology and Institute of Engineering and Management. Mission 10X, run by a not-for-profit trust of Wipro, was launched two years ago to train 10,000 engineering teachers across the country by September 2010.         
	Over the next few months, more workshops will be organised in Calcutta, Durgapur and north Bengal for private engineering colleges.        
	Within a year, we hope to train 6,000 more faculty members. By September 2010, the programme will cover 360 engineering colleges in India, S. Nagarjuna, the general manager of Mission 10X, told Metro.

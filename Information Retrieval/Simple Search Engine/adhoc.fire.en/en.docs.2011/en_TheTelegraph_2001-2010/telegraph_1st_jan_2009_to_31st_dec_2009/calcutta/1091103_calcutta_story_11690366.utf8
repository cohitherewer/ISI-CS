	College students will take the mandatory environmental science exam at the end of their third year once the Calcutta University syndicate ratifies a proposal.        
	Environmental science currently makes up the Part I syllabus (under the 1+1+1 system) of the universitys BA, BSc and BCom courses.        
	The proposal will be placed before the syndicate in its next meeting. All the colleges will be informed about the decision once the proposal is ratified, said Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee, the pro-vice chancellor (academic).        
	The next meeting of the syndicate is likely on November 10. The proposal was approved by the universitys undergraduate council before the Puja vacation.        
	The change is likely to be effected from the current academic session and will apply to those who have taken admission in colleges this year.         
	Till this year, the environmental science examination was on 50 marks. The full marks has been increased to 100.        
	According to a Supreme Court ruling, it is compulsory to score pass marks in the subject though the marks obtained is not taken into account while determining the overall performance of an undergraduate student.        
	Students will find it difficult to take the 100-marks test in Part I as they will not get enough time to prepare, said a university official. According to him, the environmental science syllabus has been revised to include a practical paper and students will need time to do fieldwork.        
	College heads want the decision to be taken quickly. The first-year classes started in August. Environmental science is currently being taught. It is useless to teach the subject now if the examination is going to be held after third year, said a principal.

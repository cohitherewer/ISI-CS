	A tiff between neighbours over a cigarette snowballed into violence that left a physically challenged man dead and three others seriously injured in Gobra on Wednesday night.        
	The trouble started around 11pm on Tuesday when Dabbu Singh, a 32-year-old starter at Esplanade bus depot, stepped out of his house on Gobra Gorasthan Road for a smoke. Mukesh Shaw, an iron scrap dealer and transport operator who was walking past, allegedly drunk, asked him for a cigarette.        
	When Dabbu replied he didnt have any, Mukesh swore at him and pushed him around. Neighbours stopped the scuffle that ensued and sent the duo home.        
	On Wednesday evening, Dabbu and his wife Santana, 28, were allegedly stopped on their way to a grocery shop and slapped by Mukesh. According to police, Dabbu took Santana home and then went looking for Mukesh, chopper in hand. He allegedly hit Mukeshs brother Umesh on the head with the chopper.        
	Around 11.30pm on Wednesday, Mukesh, five of his brothers and a dozen associates armed with choppers, rods and sticks, barged into the Singh residence looking for Dabbu, said the police.        
	Dabbus three brothers  Ganesh, 50, Raju, 38, and Munna, 28, all of whom work in the bus depot  were home. The Shaws and their associates allegedly dragged Ganesh, who was physically challenged, into the courtyard and rained blows and kicks on him for nearly half an hour. He died on the spot.        
	Neighbours alleged that when Santana tried to stop them, they ripped her sari and punched her in the face. The Shaws then dragged Raju out and struck him on the head with a stone. They then stripped him and started beating him up on the road. When Raju slumped to the ground, barely conscious, the attackers walked away, said Munna.        
	Deputy commissioner (detective department) Jawed Shamim said the police had registered a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder against Ganeshs assailants since they had not intended to kill him.        
	We have also received a complaint against Dabbu who had struck Umesh on the head and have registered a case of attempt to murder, added the deputy commissioner.        
	Munna denied that his brother had attacked Umesh. Around 10.30pm on Wednesday, I found Mukesh and Dabbu squabbling on the road. Mukesh had whipped out a chopper and was going to strike Dabbu on the head. I tried to intervene and the blow landed on my hand, almost severing my fingers.        
	Munna could not say where Dabbu was on Thursday. The Shaw residence was locked and the family members were not available for comment.

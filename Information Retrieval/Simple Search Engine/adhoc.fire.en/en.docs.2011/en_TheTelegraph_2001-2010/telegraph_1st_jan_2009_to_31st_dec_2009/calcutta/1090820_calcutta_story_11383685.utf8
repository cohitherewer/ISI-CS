The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rain balm on power cuts
                                                                                                               Rain balm on power cuts

	The city suffered extensive power cuts on Wednesday but steady showers kept the temperature and demand down.         
	The power supply fell short of the demand by 140MW. By around 7.45pm, however, the daylong drizzle had helped narrow the gap to 100MW. Sources in the power department said a 140MW shortfall would result in rotational loadshedding stretching up to one and a half hours.         
	The Met office attributed Wednesdays rain to a monsoon trough that passed through Calcutta.         
	The city and several other parts of Gangetic Bengal received substantial rain on Wednesday. Similar conditions will persist for at least the next 24 hours, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.         
	The city received 45.9mm of rain as the temperature varied between 32.9 and 27.4 degrees Celsius.         
	Sources said the primary reason for the afternoon shortfall was low generation at the Titagarh plant since Tuesday evening. Workers hired by contractors at the plant struck work demanding better pay and refused to clear fly ash.         
	Coal wagons could not reach the plant as the tracks were blocked by fly ash, said an official. The agitation was withdrawn on Wednesday evening, after which production picked up.         
	The four units at Titagarh generated about 200MW during the evening peak hour but the shortfall still could not be bridged as a 65MW unit at CESCs Southern Generating Station collapsed following a tube leak. CESC could send only 813 MW to the grid in the evening, 70-80MW lower than what it usually supplies.         
	The state electricity distribution company supplied 484MW to the CESC grid in the evening, about 66MW less than its quota.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Gaffar the land shark in shoal of small fish
                                                                                                               Gaffar the land shark in shoal of small fish
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	When Vedic Village was taking shape in the late nineties, farmer Anil Mondal would wonder why anyone from the city would come to the interiors of Rajarhat to stay in mud houses surrounded by paddy fields.        
	In less than a couple of years since the first brick was laid at the 125-acre luxury resort, the land sharks were at his door to make an offer he dared not refuse.        
	Me and one of my four brothers had initially refused to sell our share of the family plot to the people building Vedic Village. But Gaffar Mollahs mastan bahini (local toughs) threatened us into submission, the 45-year-old told Metro.        
	Mondol not only lost his share of the eight-cottah plot in Shikharpur village but was also allegedly paid less than what three of his more willing siblings got. I was promised Rs 2.2 lakh but received Rs 88,000 less, he said.        
	He doesnt know whether the promoters of Vedic Village paid the balance amount to Gaffar as commission for clinching the deal.        
	Brothers Kishore and Kanoj Kali were the first local contacts for realtors wanting to explore this virgin territory that now teems with under-construction farmhouse complexes and wellness centres with exotic names like Rejuvenate and Galaxy.        
	The Kali siblings and other land brokers operating in the area were relegated to the background once Gaffar entered the fray. He quickly became the chief troubleshooter for realtors eyeing land in the five mouzas surrounding Vedic Village. We have only managed to facilitate small deals, said Kishore, a resident of Begu village.        
	While Gaffar used muscle to force landowners reluctant to sell, his modus operandi was more cloak-and-dagger than in-your-face intimidation, said villagers. Other land grabbers followed his style of operation.        
	The unwritten rule for all of us in the property business is not to create a law and order problem that might scare off builders and property buyers, said Kishore.        
	Until Sundays flare-up at Vedic Village following a youths death during a football brawl triggered by Gaffar and his men, residents apparently hadnt heard a gunshot being fired. I have been here since I was born, and I can tell you that what happened on Sunday was unprecedented, said 26-year-old Sudip Mondal, a technician with a mobile service provider.        
	So was the mob attack an incident that occurred in the heat of the moment or a manifestation of pent-up anger over land-grab tactics?        
	The USP of this area is that it is not far from the Rajarhat Expressway en route to the airport, it is largely unspoilt and peaceful. But I suspect the real estate lobby made the mistake of ignoring the sentiments of those who have been forced to part with their land, said a police officer investigating the attack.         
	Land is fertile in these parts but prices have gone up only recently. Several acres of land on which now stand clusters of expensive farmhouses were purchased at Rs 15,000 a cottah. The current rate of roadside land is Rs 3.5 lakh a cottah.

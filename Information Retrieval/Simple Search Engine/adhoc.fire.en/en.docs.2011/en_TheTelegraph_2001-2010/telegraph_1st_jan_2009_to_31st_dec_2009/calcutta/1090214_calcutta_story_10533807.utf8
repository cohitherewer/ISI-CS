                Three men claiming to be Bangladeshi nationals were arrested at the city airport on Friday after they failed to explain why they were carrying Nepali passports. Officials said Aman Mian, Mohammad Shahin Mian and Mazharul Islam were on their way to Singapore.    Power supply may be affected in the Canning Street (west), Clive Row, Bonfield Lane, NS Road (south), JL Bajaj Street, Noormahal Lohia Lane, Brabourne Road (north) and Pageya Patty (west) areas between 9.30am and 1pm on Saturday because of maintenance work by CESC. Parts of Kankurgachhi, Ultadanga and Maniktala, too, may suffer power cuts.

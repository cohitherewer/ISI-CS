                                                                                                               Protection for cops in Riz case
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Two Calcutta cops, accused of threatening Rizwanur Rahman who later committed suicide, will continue to have interim protection from arrest from the Supreme Court.         
	Interim protection to continue, a bench headed by the Chief Justice of India said on Friday while refusing to hear the bail pleas of former deputy commissioner (detective department) Ajoy Kumar and assistant commissioner Sukanti Chakraborty for the time being.        
	Whats the urgency, the bench remarked.         
	Kumar and Chakraborty will not be arrested till the apex court decides on their bail pleas. They are facing charges of criminal intimidation and conspiracy.         
	The state government has not sanctioned their prosecution on the graver charge of abetment to suicide.         
	Their bail had earlier been cancelled by the high court. But they were subsequently granted protection from arrest by the Supreme Court.         
	Rizwanur had married businessman Ashok Todis daughter Priyanka against his wishes.        
	Todi, who is facing charges of abetting suicide, criminal intimidation and criminal conspiracy, is on bail along with the other key accused in the case.         
	Apart from Kumar and Chakraborty, another cop, Krishnendu Das, is facing charges of criminal intimidation and conspiracy. Acting on a plea by Rizwanurs family members, who had argued that the cops could influence witnesses, the high court on November 18, 2008, cancelled the bail bonds of the cops and asked them to surrender.        
	They then appealed to the Supreme Court.

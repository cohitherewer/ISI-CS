	The Dalhousie Square area has, apart from grand buildings that are there for us to see, office buildings that are tucked away inside lanes. These are of massive proportions, although they may not have faades or other architectural features that were meant to create an impression.         
	The workaday Government of India Stationery Office at 3 Church Lane is one such. It faces St Johns Church, stretches up to Strand Road and is adjacent to Metcalfe Hall. It has a red exposed brick faade, and the high walls that encircle it make it impossible for passersby to catch a glimpse of the giant quadrangle inside.        
	This open space is hemmed in by red buildings that were once used as stores in the heyday of this organisation. But now its headquarters in Calcutta boasts a staff strength of 500, against 120 in Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai combined. There are actually three buildings inside the compound at 11 Strand Road, 11/1 Strand Road, and at 3 Church Lane, which is the most visible. All of them are uniformly red with green doors and windows and other highlights.         
	Once Metcalfe Hall too was in its possession but now the Archaeological Survey of India has taken it over. According to the Calcutta Municipal Corporations list of heritage buildings, it is Grade I. The oldest at 11/1 Strand Road (Stamp building) was constructed in 1890 and the other two are of 1896 vintage. Together the three buildings cover over 10 bighas, and there is open space besides.         
	Could not the election commission have used it instead of the National Library during the recent Lok Sabha polls? Recently, the ministry of law has been accommodated in one of the old buildings and a separate building was constructed for the Sports Authority of India four or five years ago.        
	This is one of the oldest offices of the government of India and its function is acquisition and supply of stationery to all government organisations. At one time it used to send supplies abroad too.         
	The rooms of senior officers still have some gleaming teak furniture. However, its troubles began in the 1980s, and it was closed down in 1987. Trade unionism was one of the reasons but it is also true that the officers who headed the organisation were not powerful enough to take any decisive action.        
	There have been many ups and downs in the organisations fortunes. In 1991, the Union Cabinet decision was reversed, and a study by the Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances held that the office should continue to function. However, the Economic Reforms Commission dealt another blow when in 2001 it announced that the office would be closed, a verdict that was set aside by a parliamentary standing committee report. The ministry of finance has come out in its support. The Internal Staff Study Unit, however, limited its staff strength, which, in 1980 was 1,300.        
	As in most office buildings of those times, the rooms are large and airy. It has verandahs facing the St Johns Church graveyard. The top floor verandah is colonnaded and has wooden jalis. The most showy feature of the Church Lane side is its pedimented entrance. In the groundfloor store rooms, squat pillars support the ceiling. As in most government offices, some, but not too many, belligerent posters do adorn the walls, but there are smaller ones announcing Rabindranath and Nazrul performances as well.       SOUMITRA DAS

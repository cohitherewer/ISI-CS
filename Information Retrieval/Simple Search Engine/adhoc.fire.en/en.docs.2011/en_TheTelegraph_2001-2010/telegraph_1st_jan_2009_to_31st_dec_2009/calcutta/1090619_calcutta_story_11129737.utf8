                                                                                                               Kids voices deny cop father bail 
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	A constable of Calcutta police, arrested for allegedly abetting his wifes suicide, was denied bail by the high court on Thursday on the basis of his childrens statements and the contents of her diary.        
	Kakoli Chakraborty, 44, had killed herself by jumping in front of a moving train near Belanagar station in Howrah on March 24. A day later, Uttam Kumar Chakraborty, 48, was arrested following a complaint by Kakolis parents.         
	Chakraborty, a resident of Bally in Howrah, was charged under sections 498A (torture of a woman by her husband and/or in-laws) and Section 306 (abetment to suicide).         
	Opposing Chakrabortys bail plea, state advocate Pinaki Bhattacharya told the court that the constable, posted at Sinthee police station, used to beat his wife regularly.         
	The couples 14-year-old daughter Mausumi has recorded her statement before a Howrah magistrate while their 10-year-old son Utsav has given his statement to the police. Both have described how their father would return home drunk every night and beat up their mother, Bhattacharya told the court.        
	Placing Kakolis diary before the court, the lawyer said: In her diary Kakoli mentioned several times that she was fed up with her husbands torture. The diary also reveals that Chakraborty did not give her any money to run the household. Kakoli had to ask her father to pay her childrens school fees. The cop spent all his earnings on alcohol.        
	After going through the police records and Kakolis diary, the division bench of Justice D.P. Sengupta and Justice T.K. Giri dismissed the bail plea.         
	Fraud cry: A former secretary of the Calcutta Police Association has sent a legal notice to the police commissioner asking him to take action against the current association secretary for defalcating funds.        
	Advocate Asim Ganguli, on behalf of Pradyut Kumar Mondal, stated in the notice that police chief Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti would face a lawsuit if he did not act against the secretary of the Calcutta police association, Arindam Mukherjee.        
	The lawyer alleged that Mukherjee had collected money by holding cultural programmes and other events.         
	The secretary of the police association did not take permission from the government before holding the programmes and there was no audit of the accounts. Moreover, he illegally used letterheads of various ministers while contacting artists through event management companies, alleged the lawyer.

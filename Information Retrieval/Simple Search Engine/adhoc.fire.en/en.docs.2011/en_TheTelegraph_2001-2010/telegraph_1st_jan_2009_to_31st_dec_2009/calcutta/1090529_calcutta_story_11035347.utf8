The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Roll call of exam records 
                                                                                                               Roll call of exam records 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	A record number of examinees (8,42,979), a record success rate (81.74 per cent) and result publication in record time (92 days)  the results of Madhyamik 2009, announced on Thursday, gave students, their parents, and the board something to cheer about.        
	For the first time in the history of the examination, the success rate has crossed the 80 per cent mark. Thats quite an achievement given the total number of examinees, said board president Mamata Ray.         
	According to her, the highest ever success rate  a 9.28 per cent surge over last years 72.46 per cent  was the result of a slew of initiatives the board had undertaken in the past few years.        
	Before this, the highest pass percentage in Madhyamik was 74.57 per cent in 2007.        
	From switching to grades to ensuring round-the-year tests, introducing oral exams in mathematics and English to conducting training programmes for teachers, the board had rolled out a set of measures from 2007.        
	We also changed the pass criteria this time, said Ray. Till last year, students were required to score at least 272 out of 800 and a minimum of 20 per cent in each of the eight subjects in order to pass. But this year, students with 25 per cent and above in each of the eight papers were declared successful.         
	The record success rate is indeed a positive development. But the trend has to continue and only then can we say that the examination and evaluation system has improved, said an academician, who did not want to be named.         
	Despite this years record success rate, the pass percentage in Madhyamik is several notches lower than CBSE and ICSE.        
	Around 97 per cent students appearing in ICSE 2009 cleared the examination. Though this years CBSE results are awaited, the board usually throws up over 90 per cent successful candidates.        
	A lot of innovations that we have introduced in the Madhyamik curriculum and the evaluation of students are modelled along the methods followed by the ICSE and CBSE, said a board official.         
	Thanks to the new system of grades  introduced to curb the rat race among students  the board did not announce any merit list this time. Even the marksheets of students did not show the total marks obtained or any divisions, just a seven-point grading system.        
	But as cardinal marks were given in each subject, the students and the school authorities added up the individual marks and worked out an unofficial merit list.        
	Going by such a list prepared by the school authorities in the city and the districts, Prerona Jana, a girl from Santanamoyee Girls High School in Birbhum emerged as the topper with a score of 756 out of 800.         
	Among city students, Atish Roy Choudhury, a student of Ramakrishna Mission Boys Home High School, Rahara, scored 748.        
	The highest score this year was lower than last years highest of 798 out of 800.         
	The formula of arriving at aggregate marks has changed this year as marks scored in the additional subject are no longer added. Till last year, the aggregate included marks in additional subject, scored over and above 30, explained a board official.        
	According to the success rate data maintained by the board, the pass percentage increased by around 20 per cent in 1989 and 10 per cent in 1992 but then dropped in subsequent years.        
	This years record can be treated seriously only if the percentage doesnt dip and improves further, stressed an academician.

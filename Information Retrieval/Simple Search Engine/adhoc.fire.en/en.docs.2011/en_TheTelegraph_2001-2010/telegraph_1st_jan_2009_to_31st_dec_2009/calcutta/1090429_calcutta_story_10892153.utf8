The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Blame it on local warming
                                                                                                               Blame it on local warming

	Local, rather than global, warming is to blame for this being Calcuttas cruellest April in six decades.        
	Its a myth that global warming is solely responsible for the mercury hitting new highs so early in summer. The main reason is the citys failure to stop its water bodies and greenery from disappearing, says Dipak Chakrabarty, the chief scientist of the state pollution control board.        
	The decline in humidity levels reveals how the Calcutta weather has been changing. Humidity has been less than 30 per cent on nine days this April, while in the summer of 2006 the minimum humidity dropped below 30 per cent only once, says a Met official.        
	Plummeting minimum humidity levels this April has brought in a strong, hot and dry wind (loo in weathermans parlance) that is common in Delhi rather than Calcutta.        
	According to weather scientists, water bodies and greenery influence the micro-meteorological state of an area, creating favourable conditions for formation of moisture and cloud droplets that grow around a million times and go on to become raindrops. This natural process is bound to take a beating if the resources within the system diminish, explains Chakrabarty.        
	Once a city of tanks, Calcutta has very few water bodies left. Most of these ponds and wetlands have disappeared over the past decade and a half, and been replaced by building blocks.        
	A study by the environment cell of the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority revealed that water bodies in the city have shrunk 38 per cent over the past two decades. Nearly 1,000 water bodies have been allegedly filled during the past decade. The civic body lists around 3,500 water bodies, though we suspect many of them no longer exist, says Mohit Roy of Vasundhara, an NGO that works for conservation.        
	As for green cover, the city is ranked last among all Indian metros. We do lag behind the other metros, admits Somnath Bhattacharya, the conservator of forests (parks and gardens).        
	G.C. Debnath, a director of the regional meteorological centre in Alipore, sees a clear local link in the high-heat-no-rain phases that the city has been suffering. Low moisture levels are the result of moisture-filled winds from the Bay of Bengal being stalled by hot and dry north-westerly winds blowing towards south Bengal from central and north India, he says.        
	Apart from loss of greenery and water bodies, experts blame concrete growth for the city getting hotter each summer. The huge number of multi-storeyed buildings are releasing heat from metallic surfaces and triggering a heat-island phenomenon. That happens when heat gets trapped in narrow confines, says Aniruddha Mukherjee of the department of environment science at Calcutta University.        
	And then there are the traffic fumes. According to a study by the water resources department of Jadavpur University, the vehicular population of Calcutta has risen from 1,72,323 in 1981 to 7,62,924 in 2001. Correspondingly, the total carbon di-oxide emission from vehicles in Calcutta has gone from 205.53 tonne per day in 1981 to 265.87 tonne per day in 2001.        
	Carbon dioxide has significant warming potential and the gas generated from vehicular sources has surely contributed to the local temperature trend, says professor Asis Mazumder of Jadavpur University.

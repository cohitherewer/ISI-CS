                      Understanding life through theatre                    Besides essential theatre practice, Nandikar has always been involved with a number of other socio-cultural ventures. Perhaps the most significant among these is its annual National Theatre Festival, which Nandikar has been hosting since 1984. Over the years, it has grown to be a prestigious cultural event of national importance, with participation from leading theatre troupes from across the nation, and occasionally from abroad. Luminaries including Sombhu Mitra, Ebrahim Alkazi, Habib Tanvir, Vijay Tendulkar, Girish Karnad, Utpal Dutt, Badal Sircar, Khaled Chowdhury, Amol Palekar, Birju Maharaj, Sanyukta Panigrahi, Pt Ajoy Chakrabarti and Ustad Amjad Ali Khan have been directly involved with Nandikar in this cultural odyssey. To be inaugurated this evening at 6, Nandikars 10-day 26th National Theatre Festival is being dedicated to the memory of Habib Tanvir. This years festival will feature plays by troupes from Assam, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur and Bengal. International participation comes in the form of groups from Bangladesh and Pakistan. Apart from the performance of plays everyday, there will be plays for children and young people, and exhibitions and seminars on Rabindranath Tagore and Habib Tanvir. After the inaugural ceremony, Dhaka Theatre of Bangladesh will stage the Bengali play, Dhaboman (dir: Shimul Yousuff; a scene from it appears here), which narrates the story of a bull, who allows his own life to be sacrificed to save the life of his masters son.

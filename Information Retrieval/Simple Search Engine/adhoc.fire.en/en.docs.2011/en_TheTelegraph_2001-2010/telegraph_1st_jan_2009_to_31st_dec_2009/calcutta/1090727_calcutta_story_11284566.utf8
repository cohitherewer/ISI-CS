The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Boost needed for boom
                                                                                                               Boost needed for boom
  - Bengal not on biz radar, rue speakers          A STAFF REPORTER                          Soumitra Chatterjee speaks at the meet. Picture by Aranya Sen                                        
	The east has a vast pool of talent but lags behind other parts of the country in terms of infrastructure and government support. From acting legend Soumitra Chatterjee to channel head Rajesh Kamat, participants at Rising East  The Melting Pot for Technology, Media and Entertainment Opportunities reached this consensus at The Oberoi Grand on Friday.        
	The day-long meet organised by the Indo-American Chamber of Commerce in association with The Telegraph focussed on why the east was slow to adopt technological innovations and did not offer as many opportunities in the fields of media and entertainment as the rest of the country.        
	Be it information technology or films, opportunities in West Bengal are limited. It is heartening that local cinema now has corporate backing but a lot more needs to be done, said Satyajit Rays favourite actor, the guest of honour at the programme.        
	The other speakers echoed him. Shooting a film or setting up a production studio costs much less in the east yet few are willing to invest their time and money here. Bengali films should be allowed to reach out to a pan-Indian audience. Even Bangladesh presents a huge potential as a market for Bengali films but nothing has been done so far to tap that market, said film-maker Goutam Ghose.        
	Lack of infrastructure and state government apathy were cited as the reasons why the entertainment and media boom has bypassed Bengal.        
	We dont even have proper cameras to shoot with. The condition of the studios here is deplorable. Unlike Mumbai, Chennai or Hyderabad, no one is willing to come forward to invest in our films and television shows, said Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury, the director of Anuranan and Antaheen.        
	But why is Bengal still not on the radar? What keeps outside investors away can be blamed on the perception that this part of the country is generally lackadaisical in its approach. The strikes and political unrest do not help, said Ratikant Basu, the chairman and CEO of Broadcast Worldwide Limited.         
	Bengal, along with the rest of the east, should make an earnest effort to abandon the frog-in-the-well mentality. We should be open to more innovations. Only then will we have investors coming in, felt Chatterjee.        
	Sumedha Saraogi, the vice-president of DQ Entertainment, which has recently set up operations in the city, was optimistic. She felt advantage Bengal is a reality.        
	State IT minister Debesh Das assured the guests that the government was trying to boost infrastructure. Rajesh Kamat, the CEO of Colors channel, was not convinced. We need incentives in the form of superior infrastructure and guaranteed returns on investment to invest in the east. And most importantly, is the east willing to accelerate its pace? he asked.

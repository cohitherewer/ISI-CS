          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The Centre wants to turn Acharya Bhavan, the house of Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose, into a museum.        
	Jawhar Sircar, the secretary of the Union culture ministry, on Saturday invited a proposal from the Sir JC Bose Trust-I, which looks after the 93 APC Road address, to convert it into a museum.        
	We can utilise our assistance to local museum scheme to convert this treasure-trove into a heritage institution, said Sircar at the inauguration of a series of lectures to commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of the scientist on November 30.        
	Five years ago, the state government had requested the Union government to make the house a museum but did not receive a response, added Sircar.        
	The Centre is now ready to shell out up to Rs 3 crore for the project. The state government will have to pay 20 per cent of the cost for conversion. The rest will be given as a one-time grant to the institute.        
	The first round of meetings for the project is over and it is now up to the trust to submit the proposal.        
	The trust has been hesitant to come up with a proposal since it is not sure whether the state government will bear 20 per cent of the cost, according to sources.        
	We have been trying to convert Acharya Bhavan into a memorial and are very happy with the offer by the culture secretary. But we will have to consider a number of factors before taking a decision, said Parul Chakrabarti, one of the trustees.        
	The house, which was built by Bose in 1902, has his personal belongings, scientific instruments, art collection and other memorabilia, some bearing evidence of his involvement in the Indian national movement.

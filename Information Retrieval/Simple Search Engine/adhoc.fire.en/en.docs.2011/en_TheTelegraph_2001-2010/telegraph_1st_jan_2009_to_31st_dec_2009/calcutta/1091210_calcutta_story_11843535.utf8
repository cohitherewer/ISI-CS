	Do-it-yourself Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee dumped the new Writers Buildings work ethic on Wednesday to stand up for the 10,000-odd employees who deserted their offices after lunch to hear him speak at a traffic-stopper rally.         
	Newspapers have made a mockery of the new attendance code at Writers. But if you check what the situation was a week to 10 days after it was introduced, you will see the difference. I thank all of you for reaching and leaving your offices on time, and I request you to maintain this habit, the chief minister said, ignoring the fact that they were at a rally when they should have been in office.        
	Ganesh Modak (name changed), a lower division clerk of the agricultural department, said he took half-casual leave to attend the rally on Rani Rashmoni Road, organised by the CPM-controlled State Government Employees Co-ordination Committee in protest against price rise and Maoist insurgency.        
	We were told on Wednesday that everyone must attend the rally, he said.        
	The 42-year-old clerk left his second-floor office in Block B around 2pm, defying the governments circular on November 17 barring employees from leaving Writers Buildings before 5.15pm.         
	Those who stayed back in office were in no mood to work either. Some dozed off while others were glued to their cellphones.        
	Finance minister Asim Dasgupta, who initiated the new attendance code, said taking half the day off was tantamount to violating the official timings.        
	The service rules do not mention anything about half days, he said.        
	At 4pm, with still an hour and a half to go for the office gates to shut, most of the departments at Writers Buildings were almost empty while the city centre was chock-a-block with CPM supporters listening to the chief ministers speech.        
	Traffic had gone haywire from noon itself with police blocking all the approach roads to Esplanade, triggering snarls on SN Banerjee Road, Lenin Sarani and Chittaranjan Avenue.        
	Leaders of the employees co-ordination committee argued that members were within their rights to take half the day off.         
	Manoj Kanti Guha, the joint secretary of the committee, said: People who attended the meeting since morning took casual leave. The rest took half days leave. Employees work hard round the year. They surely are entitled to take half a day off once in a while.        
	Permanent employees are entitled to 14 days of casual leave a year, though the standard practice around the world is to abolish this privilege if the five-day week is followed. As for half casual leave, theres nothing official about it even at Writers.        
	Home secretary Ardhendu Sen pegged attendance at Writers on Wednesday morning at 72 per cent. But he failed to provide figures for the second half.         
	I am yet to receive the attendance statistics for the second half, he said.        
	Office timings for the majority of the employees are 10am to 5.30pm with a grace period of 15 minutes. According to the new code, if an employee comes in late for more than three days in a month he or she would have to forfeit a days casual leave.

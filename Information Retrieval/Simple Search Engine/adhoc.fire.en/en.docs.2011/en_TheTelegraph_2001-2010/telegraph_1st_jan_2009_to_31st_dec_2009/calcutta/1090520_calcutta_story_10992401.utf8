                                                                                                               Guard, help arrested on rape charge 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The guard and a domestic help of a south Calcutta flat have been arrested on the charge of raping a 14-year-old who worked for the same household.        
	Dulal Baidya and Santosh Mouar were rounded up on Tuesday after the landlady, a Jalpaiguri resident who often comes to Calcutta for her husbands medical treatment, lodged a complaint with Lake police station.        
	Baidya, 38, a resident of Jalpaiguri, always accompanied the family to the city. Mouar, 32, is from Bihar. The family had appointed him as the guard of the Motilal Nehru Road apartment.        
	The landlady had no inkling of what was happening in her flat till the girl, also a resident of Jalpaiguri, was taken ill on Sunday and was admitted to a nursing home the next day, said an officer of Lake police station. The family had appointed the girl as domestic help eight months back.        
	At the nursing home, the doctors realised that she had been sexually assaulted several times. The victim then narrated her ordeal to the landlady and told her that the duo had threatened her with dire consequences if she opened her mouth.        
	The victim told the police that Dulal and Santosh had raped her on May 14 and May 15. For the next two days, the child could barely move and complained of illness. With the landlady busy with the treatment of her husband, the duo kept threatening the child not to speak up.        
	nMishap: Kavita Mondol, 50, died on Tuesday afternoon after being crushed between a Matador and a private bus on Tobin Road in Baranagar. Police said the Matador was overtaking the bus from right.

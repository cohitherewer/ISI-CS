The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Raids for cop death
                                                                                                               Raids for cop death
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The CID on Sunday raided the houses of five people in Dum Dum and Sinthee in connection with the death of GRP sub-inspector Arindam Manna.        
	Officers said the names of all five had figured on the call list of Mannas cellphone. The cop was found dead beside the railway tracks in Mankundu last Wednesday.         
	We got the five names after going through Mannas call records. They were in touch with him. We are trying to zero in on the people he had spoken to a couple of days before his body was found, said an investigating officer.         
	The sleuths refused to disclose what leads they had come across during the raids but sources said Arindams professional and personal acquaintances were under the scanner.         
	The cops have also learnt that some of Arindams acquaintances in Dum Dum and Sinthee have criminal antecedents. We are trying to find out how close he was to these people, the officer added.        
	A source in the CID said Arindam had made several calls on Tuesday evening to the girl he was supposed to get married to in April. The CID spoke to the girl and her family members.        
	The last time he spoke to her was at 11.30pm, when he asked her to forget him. She wanted to know why Manna was saying so but he kept repeating the line. The girl is mentally shattered and we could not speak to her for long, said an officer.         
	The officer-in-charge of the Dum Dum GRP, Manab Chakraborty, too, is under the scanner.        
	After talking to a Dum Dum GRP officer, we learnt that Chakraborty had a tiff with Manna last month. The sub-inspector felt humiliated as Chakraborty had rebuked him in front of some of his colleagues. But Chakraborty denied having had any tiff with Manna, said a CID official.         
	We are trying to find out the reason for Arindams tiff with the officer-in-charge and why he was harassed by some of his colleagues, the official added.         
	Chakraborty had told Mannas relatives that he had come to his office on Tuesday and begged forgiveness.

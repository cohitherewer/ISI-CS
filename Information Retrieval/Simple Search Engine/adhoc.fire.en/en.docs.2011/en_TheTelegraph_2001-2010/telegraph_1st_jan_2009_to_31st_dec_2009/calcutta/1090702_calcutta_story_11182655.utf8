The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fewer orders from abroad hit idol hub 
                                                                                                               Fewer orders from abroad hit idol hub 
  - Kumartulis export earnings decline as NRI Puja budgets shrink in meltdown heat          POULOMI BANERJEE                          A fibreglass Durga idol Kumartuli exported last year                                        
	Downturn has struck the abode of the deity.        
	Puja will begin early this year  September 24  and work has begun at the idol-makers hub in Kumartuli, but the artisans are not quite counting their blessings.        
	Non-resident Bengalis who usually place orders for idols months before Puja are not calling up anymore, at least not in as many numbers as they used to.         
	 An order from abroad is always lucrative, said Babu Pal, the secretary of the Kumartuli Mritshilpa Sanskriti Samity. The idols that are sent abroad are now mostly made of fibreglass. It takes longer to make these idols, but they are more expensive.         
	A fibreglass idol takes a month to make and costs approximately Rs 1 lakh. A clay idol of the same size would cost Rs 10,000-12,000. More orders from abroad mean more money from fewer idols, said Pal.         
	For idol-makers who cater mainly to clients abroad, it is already looking like this could be a year of big losses.        
	 I am making only two Durga idols for clients abroad. I usually sell six to seven idols to NRIs every Puja. My overall income this season will be around 50 per cent less than what I had earned last year, said Prodyut Paul.         
	Kaushik Ghosh, the son of master craftsman Amar Nath Ghosh, is also bracing for a dip in his earnings because most of his clients are NRIs.         
	I usually send around 18-20 idols abroad on an average. I have received only 14 orders so far this year, said Ghosh.         
	According to Pal, Kumartuli sends about 44 idols abroad on an average every year. But till now we have orders for only 30.        
	Some artisans have received calls from NRIs cancelling orders placed months in advance.         
	Four of my orders were cancelled. I asked them what the problem was, and they said they could not afford a new idol this year. They have had to trim their Puja budgets because of the meltdown, said Paul.                     
	Puja organisers abroad confirmed that their budgets had become smaller.         
	 I have not heard of anyone deciding not to get a new idol because of the recession, but it is true that Pujas are being organised on tighter budgets. So many people have lost their jobs, the future is very uncertain, said Anirban Mukhopadhyay, a chartered accountant involved with the London Sharad Utsav.         
	The Durga Bari in Houston does not require a new idol because it has a permanent one made of ashtadhatu (an alloy of eight metals). But organisers are still going to cut costs.         
	 We have decided to keep the subscription rates low as so many members are going through a difficult time. We are trying to raise more money from those who can afford it, said Jayanta Bandopadhyay, one of the organisers at Durga Bari.         
	Bandopadhyay said he knew of a Puja in Kentucky that would complete 25 years this year but not get a new idol. They will make do with an idol purchased from Kumartuli four-five years ago.

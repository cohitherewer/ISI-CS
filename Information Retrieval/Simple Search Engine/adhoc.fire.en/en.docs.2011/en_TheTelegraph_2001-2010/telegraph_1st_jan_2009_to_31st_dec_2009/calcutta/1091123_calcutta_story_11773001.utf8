The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pool cars on till talks
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Pool cars on till talks
          OUR BUREAU                               
	Pool car operators have decided to postpone their indefinite strike till a meeting with transport minister Ranjit Kundu on Monday afternoon, adding to the confusion of parents and school authorities.        
	We took the decision on Friday evening and we are trying to ensure that students and their parents are not inconvenienced on Monday morning. But we are not sure how to inform all the pool car operators, said Abir Roy, the secretary of the Pool Car Owners Welfare Association.         
	The city and its surrounding areas have around 7,500 pool cars and a significant proportion of schoolchildren depend on this mode of transportation. With the government deciding to crack down on pool cars  most of which run without proper registration and safety norms  the operators had called an indefinite strike.        
	I spoke to the representatives of the pool car operators over phone this evening. I told them that the government was willing to listen to them if they called off the strike, said minister Kundu.        
	As a carrot to bring the pool car owners to the talks table, he assured them that there wont be any crackdown on Monday.         
	I have instructed the transport secretary to request the police commissioner not to crack down at least on Monday, added Kundu.        
	Parents of school-going children were left confused by the flip-flop . I will call up the operator on Monday. My son will be able to appear for his Class VII geography unit test only if the pool car turns up, said Mitali Banerjee, a widow living in Dhakuria.        
	What happens if they decide to go on a strike after their meeting with the minister? Will our kids then be stranded in school? demanded others.        
	Pool car operators claimed that children taken to school in the morning would be dropped back home.         
	We also want to run our business properly and we want the government to help us by granting separate permits, said Roy.

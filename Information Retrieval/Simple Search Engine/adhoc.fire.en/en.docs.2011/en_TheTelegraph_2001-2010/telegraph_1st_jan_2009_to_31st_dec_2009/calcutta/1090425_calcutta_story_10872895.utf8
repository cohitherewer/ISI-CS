          OUR BUREAU                          A mother and child brave the heat in south Calcutta on Friday afternoon. Picture by Pabitra Das                                  
	The mercury breached the 40-degree mark for the fifth time in seven days on Friday to reach 40.6 degrees Celsius, five degrees above normal. There was nothing to cheer in the forecast for the weekend either  the weatherman said the heat wave would continue, with loo in the afternoons.        
	The minimum temperature on Friday also stayed three degrees above normal at 28 degrees Celsius. Humidity ranged between 12 and 94 per cent.         
	The low minimum humidity eased the discomfort index from Thursdays 66 degrees Celsius to 62.2 degrees on Friday, seven degrees above normal.        
	The power situation in the city and its adjoining areas improved marginally, but rotational cuts continued. The power shortfall in the CESC-served areas in the city was 115MW on Friday evening, a shade better than Thursdays 185MW.         
	In the districts served by CESC, the supply fell short by about 250 MW. On Thursday, it was 435MW.        
	City households suffered power cuts for about an hour, while in the districts the power cuts ranged between two-and-a-half and three hours.        
	To keep the power cuts in the city restricted to about an hour, we resorted to a 40MW loadshedding in the industrial areas under CESC in Howrah, Hooghly and North 24-Parganas, a CESC official said.        
	The demand for power in the CESC-served areas in the city and the districts was 4956MW on Friday evening.        
	The West Bengal Power Development Corporation Limited (WBPDCL), which runs the state-owned power plants, on Friday operationalised a 210-MW fifth unit at Bakreswar and a 300-MW unit at Sagardighi.         
	However, the 210-MW second unit of the Bakreswar plant had to be shut down after it developed a snag. We plan to restore the second unit of Bakreswar to working condition by Sunday, said S. Mahapatra, the managing director of WBPDCL.        
	Speaking about the weekend forecast, G.C. Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore, said: Saturday will be hot and uncomfortable, with the temperature ranging between 41 degrees Celsius and 27 degrees Celsius. There will be loo in the afternoon.        
	Loo is a strong, hot and dry wind, which blows over northern, central and parts of western India during the daytime in summer.         
	With high temperatures nearing 45 degrees Celsius, it can cause heat strokes, which may turn fatal.        
	The hot, dry northwesterlys are continuing to blow in over south Bengal from the heat wave zones in central and north India, causing a heat wave here, the weatherman said.         
	The only relief this time of the year comes in the form of Norwesters, which cause rainfall. But the conditions over the last seven days have been far from conducive for Norwesters. Till the time there is adequate moisture in the lower troposphere and an anti-cyclonic formation over the Bay of Bengal, Norwesters wont show up, he said.

                      Emotions in bronze                    The bond between a mother and child cannot be expressed simply in terms of love. It is fundamental, universal yet unique and is, perhaps, the most beautiful relationship of all. From time immemorial, artists have derived creative inspiration from this special relationship, idolising and glorifying it in their works. In Europe, Renaissance pictorial artwork frequently depicted Mary and the infant Jesus, often surrounded by angels or saints. Many renowned painters and sculptors, including Mantegna, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo and Raphael, turned their skills toward the creation of Madonna images. Mother and child imagery in Indian art has also centred around religious icons, like baby Krishna or baby Ganesha ensconced in their mothers arms. Secular art followed this tradition and hence we commonly come across images of an affectionate mother nursing her helpless newborn or caressing her mischievously playful child. In Mother amp; Child, the ongoing exhibition, 14 artists of Bengal have come together to put forward their interpretation of this wonderful bond through bronze sculptures. Anchored by Tapas Sarkar, it features works by senior artists Shanu Lahiri (a sculpture by her appears here) and Partha Pratim Deb. Better known for their paintings, they have tried their hand at bronze sculpture for the first time at this show. Also featuring sculptures by Shankar Ghosh, Tapas Sarkar, Anil Sen, Subrata Biswas, Sudarshan Pal, Srilekha Sarkar and others. Their forms express a joyful response to life and celebrate the mutual affection and identification between mother and child.                    Event: An exhibition of sculpture by eminent artists When: Till March 31; 5 pm - 8 pm

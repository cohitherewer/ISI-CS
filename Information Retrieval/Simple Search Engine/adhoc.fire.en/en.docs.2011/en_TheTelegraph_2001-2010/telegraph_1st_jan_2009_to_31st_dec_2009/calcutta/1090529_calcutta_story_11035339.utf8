The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Power lines limp back
                                                                                                               Power lines limp back
  - Pockets still in dark, Buddha pats utility on the back          OUR BUREAU                                                  
	Power would be restored to 99 per cent of the Aila-affected pockets in the city by the time Friday dawns, CESC has announced.        
	On Thursday evening, while countless families reeled under power-cuts stretching up to 80-90 hours, a CESC official claimed that chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had expressed satisfaction over the utilitys success in restoring supply to the storm-ravaged city.        
	CESC representatives on Friday afternoon presented a progress report of their work since Monday at a meeting the chief minister had held with officials from various departments.        
	The utility also handed over a status report to chief secretary Ashok Mohan Chakrabarti at Writers Buildings.        
	We have mentioned in the status report the areas where repairs have been carried out and the ones where supply is yet to be restored, said a CESC official.        
	Dilip Sen, the executive director of CESC, said: We have completed 95 per cent of the work and will complete 99 per cent by tonight. Workers and technicians are working on a war-footing.        
	Around 1,700 workers in 200 teams are at work.        
	The figures did little to soothe the frayed nerves of the residents of Panchasayar, Regent Park, Bijoygarh, Belghoria and parts of Thakurpukur and Birati, who are still without power and are blaming CESC for their ordeal.        
	The utility is indifferent and ill-prepared, is the verdict of the people in these areas.        
	Residents vented their ire by blocking the tracks between Dum Dum Junction and Belghoria stations and setting up a blockade on Diamond Harbour Road in Taratola.        
	CESC officials said the most difficult task was to restore supply to Panchasayar, where as many as 16 electric poles had been uprooted.        
	Technicians are making temporary arrangements to bring back electricity to the Bypass neighbourhood and some other areas where the entire supply network has collapsed. It will take some time to erect new poles. So we are focusing on temporary arrangements, said an official said.         
	We could not start any repair work on Monday because of the storm. On Tuesday morning, when our men started work there were uprooted trees all around. Repairs gathered pace only after civic men started clearing the trees from Tuesday afternoon, said a CESC official.

          A STAFF REPORTER                           Sunil Roy                                  
	Bad investments in real estate projects and the stock market may have driven CPM local committee member of Rajarhat, Sunil Roy, to suicide, a preliminary investigation has revealed.        
	The 55-year-old leader was found hanging in a room he had checked into in the boarding complex of a Mayapur temple on Saturday, two days after he had left home.         
	Investigators believe Roy had committed suicide and are awaiting the post-mortem report for confirmation.        
	We found out that Roy had invested a lot of money in real estate projects in the Rajarhat area that had got stuck because of lack of customers. We are also looking into his investments in the stock market, said an officer of Nabadwip police station.         
	Roys activities as the president of Kalipark United Sporting, a club near his residence, is also under the scanner.         
	Members of the club refused to accept that Roy might have committed suicide after being insulted by some of them. We argued bitterly several times in the past and settled our differences later. Sunildas family members told us that he was upset for a week whereas the arguments in the club took place only on Wednesday night, said Subrata Boral, a member of the club.        
	Roy did not take his mobile phone when he left home early on Thursday. The journey from Rajarhat to Nabadwip takes around four hours. But Roy checked into the temple under an assumed name on Friday. It is important to know what he did in between, added the officer.        
	Sunil took part in the evening puja in the temple on Friday. The temple officials said he looked quite normal, said Pals friend Tapas Chatterjee, the chairman of Rajarhat-Gopalpur municipality. Chatterjee accompanied Pals body from Nabadwip to his Rajarhat residence on Sunday afternoon.

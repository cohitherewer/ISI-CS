The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Woman found hanging, husband held
                                                                                                               Woman found hanging, husband held
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 33-year-old homemaker, Moon Moon Pan, was found hanging in her bedroom in Regent Park in south Calcutta early on Friday.        
	A complaint by her father Tushar Kanti Das led to Moon Moons husband Himangshu being arrested and charged with murder. The cops are looking for Himangshus mother, who has also been named in the complaint.        
	Though Himangshu has been booked under IPC sections 302 (murder), 498A (wife torture) and 34 (crime committed by more than one persons), the police said Moon Moons death appeared to be a case of suicide.        
	It seems to be a case of suicide but we are looking into every possibility. Nothing can be said for sure till we receive the post-mortem report, said additional superintendent of police S.K. Chowdhury.        
	Moon Moon lived on the second floor of a four-storeyed building with her husband and a five-year-old son. Himangshus parents live barely five minutes away.        
	Police said Moon Moon and Himangshu had a love marriage seven years back. But of late, their relationship had soured. Himangshu used to drink heavily and return home late at night. He would allegedly beat up Moon Moon when she objected to his ways.         
	Himangshu runs a travel agency in Sonarpur and is also involved in real estate.         
	Himangshu told the cops that on Thursday, he went to sleep with his son while Moon Moon retired to an adjacent room.         
	Around 2.30am he woke and found the door of his room locked from outside. He called up two friends, who came to his house and opened the door. They found Moon Moon hanging from the ceiling fan.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Trucks roll out relief
                                                                                                               Trucks roll out relief
          A STAFF REPORTER                                          
	Consumers can finally breathe easy. The nationwide transporters strike that began last Monday and sent vegetable and fish prices soaring was called off at 6.15pm on Monday after the Centre and the All India Motor Transport Congress arrived at a consensus.        
	With the unconditional release of our leaders and the agreement to form a joint committee with an equal representation from us, we agreed to call off the strike. It is a victory for our struggle, Raja Roy, the convener (east zone) of the transporters body, told Metro.        
	The strike led to a price hike for most daily commodities in Calcutta, prompting many consumers to buy less quantities of necessities to stay within their budget.        
	Prices would have escalated further on Tuesday had the strike not been called off as the city remains dependent on other states for many essential commodities.         
	Foodstuff like sugar and atta, vegetables like onion, garlic and ginger and fruits like apples and oranges became dearer in the city in the past few days. The price of mutton, fish and eggs also rose steeply (see chart).        
	Onions generally come to Calcutta from Maharashtra and ginger and garlic from Meghalaya and Jharkhand. Rohu, a Bengali staple, comes from Andhra Pradesh.         
	Prabhat Kumar Das, the spokesperson for the Federation of Traders Organisations, echoed the sense of relief among traders after the strike was called off.         
	Almost all items that come in trucks from other states had become costlier. The situation would have worsened from Tuesday, he said.        
	On Monday, barely 15 per cent of the nearly 3 lakh trucks that normally ply across the state rolled out.        
	Biswanath Agarwal, the general secretary of the Posta Bazar Market Association, said: If the strike didnt end by Tuesday, people would have faced a major problem. Even the intra-state movement of trucks had thinned considerably.        
	It would, however, take some time before the supply becomes normal. Though truckers are expected to resume work from Tuesday, transporters said it would take at least five days for the supplies and the distribution network to get back on track.        
	Trucks will ply from Tuesday. But the situation wont normalise till at least Sunday, said Roy.         
	Over 70 lakh trucks in the country and some 2.5 lakh trucks across Bengal were off the roads for eight days. The damage cannot be undone in a few hours, he added.

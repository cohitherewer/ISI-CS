	The state government intends collecting cess on the motor vehicles tax of commercial vehicles in an attempt to provide a social security cover for all employees in the sector.        
	The West Bengal Transport Workers Welfare Bill, which calls for levying the cess on all commercial vehicles, will be tabled in the Assembly during the upcoming winter session.        
	Commercial vehicles include buses, minibuses, trucks, Matadors, taxis and autorickshaws, labour minister Anadi Sahoo said. Finance minister Asim Dasgupta said the cess would be less than 10 per cent of the motor vehicles tax.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Chitpur faces
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Chitpur faces

	It is impossible to reduce the multiplicity of faces that Chitpur has to a single exhibition of a limited number of photographs. For Chitpur, the ancient arterial road coursing from north to south Calcutta and running parallel to Chittaranjan Avenue of 1941 vintage, is also a state of mind, the personification of the spirit of Calcutta, a young city without the grandeur of Mughal Delhi but with a quaint albeit sad charm that has an appeal of its own.        
	Saibal Das in his current exhibition at the Seagull Media and Arts Resource Centre brilliantly captures some, if not all the facets of ancient Chitpur, whose Islamic, Marwari and Bengali stretches can quite easily be identified. A photojournalist, Das can instantly fix on black-and-white film images that are there for an instant and gone the next moment. At the same time, he can discern the magic in everyday things. The alchemy of his vision turns them into images hovering midway between dream and reality.         
	Kumartuli is one of the biggest cliches of Chitpur and Calcutta. But Das has the eye to look beyond them all and discover the old, bare-bodied artisan, his back curved at an angle Krishna-fashion, and his arms outstretched like that of the deities he is creating. The artist and his art become indistinguishable.        
	In another gem of a shot, the centurion and the nymphs of Putulbari emerge from the grotty walls of a pissoir, complete with a urinal. Das has the nerve to bring all those incongruous elements together with such disconcerting effect yet not miss the poetry that such natural conjunctions can yield.         
	Das is also a great one for getting the much-hyped decisive moment. The faithful  eyes bright with longing in the presence of divinity  spread out their saris mid-air as prasad is being flung at them like manna from heaven. A Shiva devotee in silhouette does a jig in front of the Hooghly while his dhoti flutters above him in a vertical frame. In the boldest shot, a man sneaks a glance at an ample derrire as he walks past a Sonagachhi house (picture above).        
	Das also composes some memorable shots with advertisements, political slogans and the writing on the crazy china walls of Siddheswaritala. The fresh paint of the graffiti glows against the battered walls, transporting them to hyper-reality.        
	Dass photographs of Muslim Chitpur look almost casual besides these. He could not have devoted much time to them. This shortcoming notwithstanding, it is a revealing exhibition.       SOUMITRA DAS

                                                                                                               Super kid right from the womb
          PREANCA ROY                              
	The foundation for a childs development is laid during the first four years of his or her life. If the brain can be stimulated in this period, it improves memory, concentration and intelligence in later life.         
	This is the guiding principal of two programmes being started by Aspire Superkids, a Chennai-based learning centre for children with its Calcutta branch on Bondel Road.         
	On April 26, a session illustrating the concept was conducted at Birla Planetarium by G.M. Paulraj, the chief trainer, who explained that the learning ability of a child can be enhanced right from the womb.        
	Welcome home, baby is for expecting mothers who will be taught skills to communicate with the child in the womb.         
	The second, My Smart Baby, is a multiple intelligence development programme for infants and toddlers. Each programme comes for a fee of Rs 5,000, including the follow-up session.         
	The four-month long programmes, comprising two one-hour sessions a month, will focus on developing the emotional, intellectual and social development of babies.         
	For the second programme, mothers will be provided with a learning kit, comprising pictures and flash cards, using which they will teach their children, elaborated Paulraj.         
	The mothers will also be taught to cultivate a calm state of mind while interacting with their children, he added.         
	Said Shalini Secsaria, a mother-to-be who plans to register for one of the programmes: In todays cut-throat world, a programme like this might give my child an edge over others.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Gear up for Nano add-ons
                                                                                                               Gear up for Nano add-ons
          SUBHRO SAHA                                            
	The CPMs ploy to use Nano as its poll plank may have come undone, but car detailing agencies are revving to do up the small car.         
	To cater to the price-conscious Nano-owner, car accessory showrooms are readying customised solutions that wont pinch the pocket.         
	For Rs 10,000, a Nano-owner can get a music system, plush seat covers, floor mats, sun-control film and a hi-tech security system.        
	The Nano will be the switchover vehicle for many two-wheeler owners and youngsters. Also, we expect a large number of women behind the Nano wheel. All of them will want to do up the car. We will cater to this emerging segment, said Vinay Daga of car detailing agency Glix.        
	Calcutta, which sells around 3,000 new cars a month, expects to add another 2,000 Nanos to the monthly tally.        
	We expect the base version of the Nano to sell most, and since this is a non-AC model, our basic accessories package is being designed keeping this model in mind, said Neeraj Banka, a city distributor of automobile accessories.        
	The Rs 10,000 entry-level package will have upgrade options too. Glix is launching Silver (Rs 10,000), Platinum (Rs 25,000) and Diamond (Rs 35,000) packages with monthly instalment options.        
	This is great news. I can opt for the package that suits my requirement. I want graphics on my Nano body, cavity protection and better quality speakers, said Ankit Baid, who has booked a silver Nano.         
	We plan to display four decked-up demo Nanos at our four city showrooms to underline what you can do with the car. Also, looking at the sheer volume we will have to handle, we are training a separate set of technicians to fit only Nano cars with customised accessories, Daga added.        
	According to Banka, companies like Garware, which makes sun-control film, and Panasonic and Delphi, makers of car audio systems, have come up with pocket-friendly variants of their products to suit the owners of the worlds cheapest car.        
	The Nano is emerging as a favourite gift item too, and one would always want to doll up a gift before delivering it, said Dinesh Prasad, another auto accessories supplier who hopes to make big bucks on the small car.        
	Other companies are working on innovations like folding trays for bottles, boxes and ice-coolers and detachable storage modules for the boot.         
	Some accessories retailers are looking at the possibility of tying up with multi-brand outlets for dedicated kiosks vending Nano accessories.

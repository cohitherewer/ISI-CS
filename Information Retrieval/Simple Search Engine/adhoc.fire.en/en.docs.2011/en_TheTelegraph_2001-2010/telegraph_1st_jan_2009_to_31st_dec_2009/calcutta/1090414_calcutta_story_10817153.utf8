The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Court survey on plot
                                                                                                               Court survey on plot
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court has appointed two surveyors to file a report on the over two-bigha plot opposite Tata Centre that is at the centre of a legal tussle between the civic body and the army.        
	The surveyors will check whether the plot was part of the original land map of the Maidan. Justice Sanjib Banerjee will determine on the basis of the report whether the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) had the right to let out the plot to the Tatas.         
	The local army authorities, by taking advantage of their control over the Maidan, cannot claim the rest of Calcutta as their property. I will request the chief minister to take up the matter with the Centre at the earliest, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya told Metro.        
	CMC lawyer Alok Ghosh said: Many clubs with tents on the Maidan are refusing to pay taxes, claiming their premises are in the army area. Some of the clubs had moved the high court against the CMC for claiming civic charges. In all the cases, the court held that the civic body had the right to claim taxes from the clubs for providing civic services.        
	The 48-cottah plot, adjacent to Elliot Park, is being used by the Tatas for parking cars, on the basis of an agreement between Tata Steel and the CMC on February 22, 2000, which was registered in 2005. The plot, on which Elliot Park has been constructed, was handed over to the Tatas later.         
	According to the agreement, the company would have the right to park cars on the 48-cottah plot till December 31, 2015, against a payment of Rs 10 lakh a year as rent.        
	The local army authorities had issued a notice to the company asking it to vacate the plot. Challenging the legality of the notice, the Tatas had moved a case in the high court.        
	The dispute was triggered by a petition by environment activist Subhash Dutta, who alleged that a part of the Maidan had been grabbed by the Tatas. The petitioner stated that parking of cars by the Tatas had created a traffic bottleneck on Jawaharlal Nehru Road.        
	A division bench headed by Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar had disposed of the plea by observing that the plot belonged to the army.        
	The chief justices observation empowered the army authorities to ask the company to vacate the plot, said an army spokesperson.

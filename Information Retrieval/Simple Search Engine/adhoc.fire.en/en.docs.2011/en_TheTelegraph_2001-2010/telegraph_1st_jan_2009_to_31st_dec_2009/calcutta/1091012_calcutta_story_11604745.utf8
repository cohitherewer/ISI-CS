                      A toast to youthfulness                    Youth is what Bengalis associate with sarat (autumn), which, in our country, is more akin to spring in Europe. And what better way to raise a toast to the spirit of the season, than with a burst of intellectual yet youthful brainstorming, synthesised with a unique visual experience. GenNext IV, Aakriti Art Gallerys fourth annual art exhibition, thus offers the city art lovers an opportunity to witness works of art by young, upcoming artists and also to interact, discuss and discover the relevance and metamorphosis of art as a whole.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cancer patient awaits blood for surgery
                                                                                                               Cancer patient awaits blood for surgery
          RITH BASU                                              Abdul Hakim Mollah in hospital      bull;Bombay blood group (Oh) is named after the city where it was identified 
  bull;Those with Bombay blood group can only donate and take blood from people of the same group      
	A peasant with four children has spent 20 days in a city hospital waiting for blood of the rare Bombay group so that he can undergo a surgery that could cure him of cancer.        
	Abdul Hakim Mollah, a 28-year-old Sandeshkhali resident, was admitted to a free bed in Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute on April 1. The surgery to remove a portion of his stomach and food pipe has been delayed since blood of the required group is unavailable. The consequence can be fatal.        
	Abdul needs at least six units of blood. He must be given three units of blood to raise his haemoglobin to a level where he can be operated on. We havent yet found a single unit of the Bombay group, said Jaydip Biswas, the institutes director.        
	Abduls haemoglobin count is 2.6 per cent. The normal figure is 14.5.        
	Gautam Mandal, the in-charge of the institutes blood bank, said: In my 13 years at blood banks, I have come across just two recipients of this blood group. We cannot say exactly how rare the group is because there isnt enough data to work with.        
	Doctors feel there should be a list of donors with this blood group. We tracked down a man in Pathuriaghata with this blood group. He donated a unit of blood to my brother a month and a half ago, so he wont be able to donate blood for a couple of months, said Abduls brother Haque.        
	Abdul, who experiences severe pain whenever he takes food, is worried about his three girls and 15-month-old son Sulaiman Habib.        
	My wife has sold off whatever jewellery she had. We have also sold our one-bigha plot. The money has been spent on my treatment. I cant imagine what will happen to my kids if we cant find the blood and I die, said Abdul.        
	Haque has been bringing their 10 siblings and other relatives in batches to the city to check whether anyones blood group matches with Abduls. Its like searching for a needle in a hay stack, said Mandal.        
	Members of the Patient Welfare Association of the institute have also been trying to get blood for Abdul but with no luck. Our members have searched the blood banks of all hospitals and nursing homes as the condition of the patient is deteriorating daily but we havent found even one unit of the blood. Donors can contact us at 9836535815, said Abhijit Mujherjee of the association.

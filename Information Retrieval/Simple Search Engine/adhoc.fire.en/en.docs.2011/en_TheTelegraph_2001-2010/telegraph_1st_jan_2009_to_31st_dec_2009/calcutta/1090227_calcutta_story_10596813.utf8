The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mother accused of killing baby
                                                                                                               Mother accused of killing baby
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A one-and-half-year-old baby died in Belgachhia trenching ground in Howrah on Thursday, with neighbours alleging murder by the mother.        
	Police questioned Arati Balmiki, 34, but didnt arrest her as no complaint was filed.        
	There were some marks on babys forehead and cheeks, which the cops suspect were sustained after a fall. But Arati claimed the marks were sores caused by an illness. The police have started an unnatural death case.        
	Neighbours insisted Arati had killed her son Rahul by hitting his head against the wall.        
	A neighbour said: At 2.30pm I heard the boy crying for food. Then I heard a sound suggesting something was being dashed against the wall repeatedly. I rushed to the shanty and found the baby vomiting blood. He died within minutes. When I asked Arati why she killed her son, she said she was angry at his repeated demand for food.         
	Arati denied the allegation, saying the child was suffering from an illness for a long time.

                      Wings of fancy                    In their quest to fulfil material ambitions, human beings have lost touch with the earth and nature. But the women in Arpita Khaskels paintings show a distinctive urge to be in harmony with their environment. Almost always female, her subjects reject the chaos and cacophony of urban life to embrace the freedom and spontaneity found in nature. Winged with enthusiasm and joy, they look eager to discover and rejoice in its all but forgotten beauties. Flying high above the ground, they look down upon the world, soaking themselves in rain and their world of dreams. Such a fantasy-like atmosphere envelops the canvases of Khaskel, who tries to depict the fulfilment of their desires through her compositions. She makes her women-figures touch the little joys of life, the little nothings that can make big differences. In her works, loneliness transforms to freedom and freedom to joy. In the ongoing solo show of her works, a lady stands beneath a graceful krishnachura tree; the flowers beckon her and she ventures to lose herself in the gorgeous colours of nature, perhaps as she would lose herself in her lovers embrace. In another painting, the morning sun creates an illusion wherein a slum girl forgets her drab and dingy dwellings. She is overwhelmed by the lush greenery, fragrant flowers and lithe butterflies and, forgetting her unrealised desires, she becomes, for a brief moment, queen of all she surveys.                    lEvent: A solo exhibition of paintings by Arpita Khaskel lWhen: Till October 18; 11 am - 7 pm lWhere: Jamini Roy Gallery, Rabindranath Tagore Centre, ICCR, 9A Ho Chi Minh Sarani

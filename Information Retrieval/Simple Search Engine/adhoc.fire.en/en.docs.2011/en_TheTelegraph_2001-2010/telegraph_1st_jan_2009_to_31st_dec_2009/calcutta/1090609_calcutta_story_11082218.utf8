The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Dud firm no more with Nasscom 
                                                                                                               Dud firm no more with Nasscom 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Assurgent Technology Solutions did not renew its membership with Nasscom last year, the city office of the tech trade body said on Monday.        
	The Hyderabad-based company shut shop in Sector V and Durgapur recently without paying the dues of around 1,800 trainees and employees. Trainees at the company were required to pay a security deposit of Rs 1 lakh, which was not refunded.        
	Assurgents membership had lapsed last year. Our officials visited the Hyderabad headquarters of the company today and found that it had been shut for the past two weeks. None of the employees was around, Suparno Moitra, the head of Nasscoms Calcutta office, said on Monday.        
	Chief executive officer Soumitri Mukherjee, chief technology officer Sanjay Sanyal and chief finance officer Prem Prakash Gupta of the firm are absconding.        
	Moitra added the company had registered with the Survey Technology Park of India, a central government society for promoting software export, on February 20, 2008.         
	Around 80 trainees and employees of the firm met Partho Chattopadhyay, the leader of Opposition in the Assembly, on Monday and aired their grievances.        
	We narrated the entire incident to him and gave him photocopies of all our documents, said Mohammed Server Pervez, an employee who was duped of the security deposit and his salary.        
	I asked officials of Nasscom and the state IT department to dig up information about the company. If the police refuse to take strict action against the company executives, I will forward the matter to the central IT ministry, said Chattopadhyay.

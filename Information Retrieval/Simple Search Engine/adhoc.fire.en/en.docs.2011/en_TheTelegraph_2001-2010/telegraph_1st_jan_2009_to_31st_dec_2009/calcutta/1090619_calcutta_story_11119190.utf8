                                                                                                               Fear of flu ward grounds fliers

	Calcuttans are rescheduling their overseas trips as much for fear of being quarantined at the ill-equipped Infectious Diseases Hospital on their return as for fear of the flu.         
	According to tour operators, five out of 100 international travellers from the city are postponing, if not cancelling, their trips. The Union health ministrys advisory  dont travel to the H1N1 zones for two to three months  could trigger more cancellations over the next few days.        
	We have been receiving calls from clients, mainly tourists, saying they want to put their travel plans on hold, said Anil Punjabi, the chairman (east) of the Travel Agents Federation of India.         
	City-based business consultant Abha Bhargava, who was scheduled to leave for the US on May 29, postponed her trip because she feared being sent to the Infectious Diseases Hospital if she returned with even a normal bout of cough and fever.         
	I have postponed the trip by at least a month. I am horrified by the idea of going abroad, catching a cold and being dragged to the Beleghata hospital. Even if I dont have flu, I could end up catching some other infection, she said.        
	Rajesh Gidwani, who frequently travels to Bangkok, Singapore and other southeast Asian countries on business, revealed that his family was pressuring him to put his tour plans on hold for the time being. More than the flu, it is the nightmare of spending nights at the isolation ward of the ID hospital that is causing panic in the city, he said.        
	The sordid state of the isolation ward at the hospital came to light after Toronto resident Sushmita Biswas and toddler Gibson, Kalyani homemaker Sutapa Bhattacharya, and Salt Lake resident Asif Iqbal spent nights battling mosquitoes and braving unhygienic conditions till their test results arrived from Delhi. All four tested negative for swine flu.        
	A city resident who is to make an overseas trip shortly said he intended changing his return schedule so that he landed in Delhi instead of his hometown. If I happen to be running a fever on my return I can draw comfort from the knowledge that I will be quarantined in a Delhi hospital, where I am told the facilities are much better, he added.        
	Metro had reported the stark contrast between the Infectious Diseases Hospital in Beleghata and the Airport Health Organisation in Delhi, which is the designated swine flu facility in the capital.        
	Students who study abroad are also stretching their mid-year vacations because of the flu alert. My daughter would earlier return a week before the start of an academic session but this time she will be reaching maybe a day before, said the father of a girl studying in the US.        
	Representatives of airlines, however, said they were not expecting a spate of cancellations immediately.

                                                                                                               Wow, my daughter will be a beauty queen!   Mom backs beauty bid
  - Parents anxious or aggressive stand by girls bid to qualify for biggest pageant in town          POULOMI BANERJEE                          THE ECSTACY: A contestant who made it to the finals of Tilottama 2009 is hugged by her mother. (Pabitra Das)   THE AGONY: The anxious mother of a Tilottama contestant waits for the verdict. (Pabitra Das)                                        
	Mothers praying. Fathers pacing. Not outside a Madhyamik or Higher Secondary exam centre, while their children write their papers. But in the lounge of Princeton Club while their daughters battle it out for a place in the biggest beauty pageant in town.        
	I am tense, admitted a mother with a sheepish smile. This is my daughters dream and I want her to get what she wants.        
	That would mean a crack at the Dabur Gulabari Sananda Tilottama 2009 crown.        
	Some mothers sat in a huddle, silently. One put her head in her hands. I took her out of one school because they had a problem with her missing classes, and got her admitted in one that is not so strict about attendance. After all, she has to swim, go to a gym, a slimming centre and a modelling school for grooming. I often accompany her, said 18-year-old Kaviyas anxious mother Sucharita Roy.        
	Not so long ago, girls would run away from home to take part in a beauty pageant. Last Thursday, at the Prince Anwar Shah Road club, parents were right behind their daughters bid to be beauty queens.        
	Trishita Chakraborty was in a burgundy dress that her father got for her tryst with Tilottama. From the time she stepped into her teens people would tell me your daughter is very pretty and should try modelling, said proud papa Soumendra Chakraborty.        
	Trishita making the final round means more work for her father. My father will be helping out with college admission forms, so that I can concentrate on Tilottama, said the girl who has just cleared her ISC.        
	This kind of parental support was almost unheard of when Nayanika Chatterjee was making it big about a decade back. I knew of so many girls who had a problem at home. Parents didnt perceive it as a good profession. This is such a welcome change, said Nayanika, who will groom the 10 chosen finalists to help them  and their parents  pursue the dream.        
	For a few mothers it is a case of my daughter should do what I could not. Hear it from Hena Das, mother of 21-year-old Dipshikha. My parents were conservative. I would never have been allowed to participate in something like this. But my daughter has talent and I want her to do what makes her happy.        
	There are a few misgivings still. Mainly to do with what she is eating and what she will be showing. Would they show the swimwear round on television? That will be a little embarrassing for the elders in the family who will be watching, said one worried mom.                                      
	My niece has lost a lot of weight for this contest. She is living on soups and boiled food, and going to the gym a lot. We are scared that she might be taken ill but we support her dreams, said Nandini Dutta, Diya Chakrabortys aunt.        
	And then there is the lurking fear of how their little girl will cope with the big mad world of modelling. I keep telling my daughter to take it easy and be steady, said Sucharita, mother of Kaviya. And then as if reassuring herself, she added: I think the industry has developed so much that today girls dont get used the way everyone thought they did; if she sticks to her values there shouldnt be a problem.        
	Glamour world veteran Dipannita Sharma agrees. Fashion is not a novelty any more. Parents of todays teenagers have been watching beauty pageants for years. Also, fashion has become a good career option.        
	The model-actress, however, has a word of caution. Mothers shouldnt push their daughters into the glamour world, just because maybe its something they couldnt do when they were young.        
	She could easily have been referring to an overzealous mother at the beauty contest prelims who was overheard urging her daughter to pull her skirt up a bit to show more of her shapely legs to the judges.

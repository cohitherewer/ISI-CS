The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Police blind to helmet-less ride 
                                                                                                               Police blind to helmet-less ride 
          A STAFF REPORTER                            Riders without helmets in the BBD Bag area (top) and Sealdah. Telegraph pictures                                 
	A couple on a motorcycle died after being hit by a lorry in Howrah last Wednesday. Their five-year-old son was critically injured. None was wearing a helmet.        
	Officers of Calcutta police said cases of people riding two-wheelers without the mandatory helmet were on the rise. More than 6,000 riders  a small fraction of the total number of violators, according to cops  were booked in the past three months for not wearing helmets.        
	A couple of days after the Howrah mishap, Metro scanned a few busy crossings only to find that heads without helmets were a norm rather than an exception. And in almost all instances of law violation, cops were mute spectators.        
	It is impossible to book every violator, said an officer of the traffic police. During peak hours you will find countless bike-borne people without helmets in every crossing.        
	The fine for riding, or pillion-riding, a two-wheeler is Rs 100. Its too low an amount to act as a deterrent, the officer added.        
	And if biker Lucky Ghosh is to be believed, a violator, if caught, can always bribe his way out by coughing up Rs 20. If it is that easy to escape law, why bother wearing a helmet, said Ghosh, while zooming down BB Ganguly Street in central Calcutta without the headgear.        
	While law violation is rampant across the city, senior officers at Lalbazar only expressed helplessness. Despite repeated appeals and warnings, motorists are not bothered to wear helmets. Sergeants have been asked to prosecute each and every offender, said Dilip Banerjee, the deputy commissioner of police (traffic department).

                                                                                                               Trader files contempt plea
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The South 24-Parganas district magistrate will face a contempt of court charge for not returning a Tata Safari requisitioned for poll duty to its owner, Sachin Halder.        
	Dipankar Basu, who is representing Halder in the high court, said he had filed a contempt plea against the district magistrate which will be heard on Tuesday.        
	Justice Sanjib Banerjee of the court had on May 4 ordered the administration to return the car after the owner, a trader in Canning, submitted that he needed the vehicle for his wife who could not step out in the sun because of a skin ailment.        
	But instead of returning the car to Halder, the district administration moved the high court on May 8 challenging the legality of Justice Bannerjees order.        
	The division bench headed by Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar is scheduled to hear the appeal on Tuesday.        
	The sub-divisional officer of Canning had requisitioned the car on April 15 .        
	Munna Seikh, the driver of the Tata Safari, said the vehicle travelled 150km on Monday.

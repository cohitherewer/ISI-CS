The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fee hike alert for private   schools
                                                                                                               Fee hike alert for private   schools
										      MITA MUKHERJEE              Tuition fees in private English-medium schools in the city are set to rise by up to 30 per cent, following the state government rsquo;s decision to implement the Fifth Pay Commission rsquo;s recommendations on salary hike for its employees.  The fees in the private schools now range from Rs 750 to Rs 2,500 a month. Post-hike, sources said, they may rise to Rs 900-Rs 3,000.  The government has announced a 32 per cent hike in the salaries of its employees, including teachers and non-teaching staff members of state-aided schools. The new pay scales, which will have retrospective effect from April 2008, will come into force in April 2009.  But why will a hike in government employees rsquo; salaries result in an increase in the fees of private schools?  According to the rules, private schools mdash; even the ones that do not accept state grant mdash; are required to give an undertaking to the government while applying for a no-objection certificate stating that their pay scale would be the same as state-aided schools.  ldquo;It rsquo;s a must for us to pay salaries to our employees on a par with government and state-aided schools. We will have to increase students rsquo; fees to pay salaries according to the higher pay scale. There is no other option left as our school is entirely dependent on fees, rdquo; said Krishna Damani, of South Point School.  ldquo;There will be no immediate change in our school but a fee hike is inevitable next year, rdquo; said Terence Ireland, the principal of St James School.  There are around 450 private English-medium schools mdash; other than the ones run by Christian missionaries and Anglo-Indian organisations mdash; across the state. In the city, the figure stands at 250.  The Association of Christian Missionary Schools and the Bangiya Christiya Pariseba have called a meeting on March 12 to discuss the quantum of fee hike.  ldquo;The schools are taking all steps to keep the fee hike at a minimum. The issue will be discussed with the members of the managing boards of our schools, rdquo; said Herod Mullick, the general secretary of the Pariseba

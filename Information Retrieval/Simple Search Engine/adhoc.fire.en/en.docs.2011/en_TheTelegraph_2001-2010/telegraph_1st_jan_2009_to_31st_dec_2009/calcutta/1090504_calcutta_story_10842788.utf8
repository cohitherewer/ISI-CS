The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Voter cards in party hands
                                                                                                               Voter cards in party hands

	CPM workers have allegedly collected electoral photo identity cards from the election commission on behalf of residents of a Dum Dum locality without permission.        
	In February, D.N. Chowdhury, a resident of Rishi Bankim Chandra Road, under South Dum Dum Municipality, received his voter card from local CPM activist Arunabha Bose.        
	I asked him why he had collected the card on my behalf though I had not requested him to do so. He said he just wanted to help me, said Chowdhury, a retired SAIL employee.        
	I was reluctant to take the card from him and told him that I might get into trouble if I did so, but he insisted, added Chowdhury.        
	Within a week, Bose was back at Chowdhurys flat with the voter card distribution list. Arunabha had signed on the list against me and my wifes name. He told us to sign on the column for authorising somebody to collect the cards on our behalf. He said a complaint had been lodged against him with the election commission, said Chowdhury.        
	Several other residents of the area alleged that local CPM activists and councillors were collecting their voter cards without asking them.         
	CPM workers told us that they did not want us to take the trouble of going to the election authorities and collecting the card, said another resident.        
	Bose denied the allegations. CPM candidate from Dum Dum and sitting MP, Amitabha Nandi, too denied the charges.        
	Chief electoral officer Debashis Sen had said last week: I have not received any complaint till now. But if we receive a complaint, we will probe the matter seriously as it is highly irregular.         
	District election commission officials, however, said they were conducting an inquiry. The officials probing the matter have been asked to file an action taken report as soon as possible, said an election official of North 24-Parganas.

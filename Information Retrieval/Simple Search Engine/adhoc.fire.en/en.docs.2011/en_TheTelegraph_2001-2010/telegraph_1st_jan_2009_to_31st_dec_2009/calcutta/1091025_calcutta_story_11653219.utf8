The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Asha at last
                                                                                                               Asha at last
                              Asha Bhosle at the event on Friday. (Rashbehari Das)                            
	Asha Bhosle was in town on Friday for the finale of the Bharatiya Lok Sanskriti Utsav 2009 at Netaji Indoor Stadium, entertaining an audience that stayed back late to hear her.         
	I have never taken the stage so late. I should be in bed by now, said the 76-year-old diva looking at her watch. It was past 10.30pm. Before her, Shaan and Mika had done their bit, but it was Asha the crowd was waiting for. Kolkata ashte ami khub bhalobashi (I love to come to Calcutta), she smiled and started off with the sensuous Yeh mera dil.         
	When she asked what her audience wanted to hear, someone shouted Pancham da. Baatein unki karti hoon, gaanein unke gaati hoon aur biwi bhi unki hoon (I talk about him, I sing his songs and am his wife), she responded. But she was Asha Tai (big sister) too, scolding the over-excited with Ei chup! Chechamechi amake bhalo lagena (sic).         
	She spoke about the extent to which R.D. Burman would go in search of inspiration. Nassersaab (Hussain) wanted a melodious score for a film starring a 16-year-old girl. He (R.D.) tried in Mumbai, came to Calcutta  nothing happened. So we went to Nepal. While driving down Pokhra Valley, a Nepali girl walked by, singing. E kanchi, tum kya ga rahi ho? he asked. Shyly, she repeated the song. Asha, gana ban gaya, he shouted. The song was Puchho na yaar kya hua, capturing the freshness of the original, yet so different.        
	At 11.10pm, she was happy to go Dum maro dum, till a request from the security drew the evening to an end.                    SUDESHNA BANERJEE

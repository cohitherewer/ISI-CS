The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Biz boom along Bypass link
                                                                                                               Biz boom along Bypass link
          SUBHRO SAHA                                          
	Shop stops to dine dens, hi-tech offices and business hotels to multi-speciality hospitals. A rush of real estate activity along the Rashbehari connector to the EM Bypass is fast turning the corridor into a secondary business district.        
	After The Acropolis, a Rs 300-crore mixed-use destination being developed through public-private partnership between the CMDA and Merlin Projects Ltd, the latest high-profile project on the happening stretch is The Chambers, a 140,000-sq ft commercial-cum-retail development by realty major Bengal Unitech Universal.        
	We had originally planned a boutique hotel on the plot opposite Siemens. But looking at the market situation, we have re-jigged plans to do an office building with some top-rung retail and F amp;B on the ground level, Sameer Bahri of Unitech tells Metro.        
	McDonalds has already expressed interest to open an outlet alongside other restaurants and a food court in the Rs 40crore project.        
	The Chambers, a G+8 structure concept-designed by Callison of the US, is targeting small and medium enterprises with small office-space units ranging from 1,200 to 1,700 sq ft.        
	The Acropolis at Kasba Rajdanga, with 600,000 sq ft of retail and office space, will also house several theme restaurants and food courts. We are also building a 200,000sq ft car park across three levels and hope to open the property in early 2011, Merlin Projects managing director Sushil Mohta says.        
	These projects will complement the existing hi-tech office buildings, the Shrachi and Emami Towers on the other side of the Bypass, besides an array of retail outlets and restaurants/lounge bars that have sprung up in the past two years along the Rashbehari connector.        
	The Taj Gateway opposite Ruby General Hospital, a 200-room luxury business hotel from the Taj Group, is under construction and will become operational by early 2011. Also, South City Projects will soon launch a 600,000-sq ft office building on the EM Bypass near the Ruby roundabout. Quite a few large car showrooms have come up in the area as well.        
	It makes sense for corporate houses to set up offices in this location because it is well connected to the central business district, Rajarhat and the airport and also major residential areas. Besides, the cost of occupancy is lower than in the central business district, while on offer is better infrastructure and new-age buildings, says Abhijit Das, the joint managing director of property consultants Lemongrass Advisors.        
	The area has also been developing as a healthcare hub, with a clutch of new hospitals coming up to add to the bed count of Ruby General Hospital, the Rabindranath Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences and Peerless Hospital.

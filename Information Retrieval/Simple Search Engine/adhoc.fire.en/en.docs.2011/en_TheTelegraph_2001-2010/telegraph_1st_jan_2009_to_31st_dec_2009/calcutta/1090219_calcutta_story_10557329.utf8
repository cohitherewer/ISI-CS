  - Deadlines set for projects          A STAFF REPORTER                           Fast-moving mass transit system is the solution to the citys traffic woes, said the chief minister at the launch of the LRT project on Wednesday. (Sanat Kr Sinha)                                        
	The state government on Wednesday launched two major infrastructure projects aimed at improving the citys mass transit system.         
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya inaugurated the Light Rail Transit (LRT) project at Taj Bengal, while urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya laid the foundation stone for the construction of the first phase of the Vivekananda Road flyover at Girish Park.        
	The state government claimed the LRT project would be completed in five years and the flyover in 18 months. A transport department official told Metro that the projects were launched hurriedly as the Lok Sabha elections are approaching.        
	More projects will be launched over the next few weeks. No one can say when these projects will be completed, added the official.         
	The LRT will connect Joka in the south with Barrackpore in the north through air-conditioned coaches plying on elevated tracks.        
	Minutes before the inauguration, the government signed an MoU with Srei  an infrastructure and finance company which is leading a consortium of Czech company Amex International and the West Bengal Transport Infrastructure Development Limited  for executing the project.        
	The cost of the project, which will be executed in two phases, has been estimated at Rs 6,000 crores.         
	We have planned a Ring Road apart from the East-West Metro and the LRT, said transport minister Subhas Chakrabarty.        
	Earlier in the day, Asok Bhattacharya launched the Rs 153-crore flyover project from Howrah bridge to Girish Park. A ramp of the flyover will lead to Nimtala.

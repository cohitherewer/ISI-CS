                                                                                                               Teenager drowns while saving friends
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Sarfraz Akhtar                                  
	A 16-year-old boy saved two of his friends from drowning but was himself swept away in the Hooghly on Monday afternoon. Sarfraz Akhtars body could not be recovered till late at night.        
	The mishap occurred at Chain ghat, near Marine Club, in the port area. River traffic police have launched a search for the Ekbalpore residents body along with two divers.        
	We have also alerted our counterparts in nearby districts, said an officer of the river traffic police.        
	Alerted by the cries of friends Faraz and Rohit, Sarfraz dived into the river around 12.45pm. A good swimmer, Sarfraz reached the duo quickly, grabbed their hands and pushed them to the shore, police said.        
	It was high tide and Sarfraz got stuck in the middle of the river before being swept away. He saved two lives by sacrificing his own, said an officer of South Port police station.        
	Sarfraz, a Class VIII drop-out, had gone to the ghat with four friends to take a bath. While Faraz and Rohit dived into the river, Sarfraz stood on the bank talking to the other two boys  Nadeem and Irfan.        
	Faraz and Rohit could not swim and kept close to the bank. While playing in the water they somehow moved farther into the river. Finding themselves out of their depth, they started flailing their arms and shouting for help, recalled Nadeem, who works in Five Star Market.        
	Realising that his friends were drowning, Sarfraz dived into the water and swam towards them. He grabbed them and helped them reach the bank but himself got caught in the strong current. We saw him tossing in the water and then disappearing, said Nadeem, wiping his tears.         
	The boys returned to their locality in Ekbalpore and broke the tragic news. Rohit, who had gulped water, was taken to a nursing home.         
	Sarfraz was our best friend and we are alive only because of him. His death will always haunt us, said Faraz.         
	Sarfrazs father Nasim, 40, was shattered. He used to help me run my business, cried Nasim, who runs two meat shops in Bhowanipore.

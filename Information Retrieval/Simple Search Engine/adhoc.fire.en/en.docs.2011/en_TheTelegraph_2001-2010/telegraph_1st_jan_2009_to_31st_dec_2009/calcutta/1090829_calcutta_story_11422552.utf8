The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Schools bow to rally raj
                                                                                                               Schools bow to rally raj
  - On yet another michhil day, plans to duck Monday blow          OUR BUREAU                                    
	Biman Bose has managed to scare many city schools into declaring a holiday or a half-day on Monday to spare the children the travails of yet another traffic-stopper rally day.        
	The CPM state secretary had on Thursday announced Mondays rally to commemorate 50 years of its food movement and admitted that people would be a little inconvenienced, especially students in exam time, but that they should bear with us.        
	Calcuttans having to bear with Fridays four-in-one rally raj in the city centre seemed fed up at being at the receiving end all the time.        
	When will those who wield political power care about the problems that weekday rallies cause to the citizen? wondered Ranjana Banerjee, stuck in a taxi for 45 minutes on Chowringhee while taking her eight-year-old daughter Ritu back home from school.        
	On Friday afternoon, Mayo Road was the stage for a Trinamul rally, Metro Channel played host to an Aituc protest meeting, Rani Rashmoni Avenue was where a Citu michhil converged and Mahajati Sadan was the venue for a Congress congregation.        
	So the heart of the city was clogged from noon to 4pm, just like Bose has warned it will be on Monday.        
	Schools like Loreto Day School Dharamtala and Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School have decided not to put the likes of Ranjana and Ritu through the ordeal of bearing with the rally.        
	In August, because of so many unscheduled holidays like the transport strike, we have had just 17 working days, rued Malini Bhagat, the principal of Mahadevi Birla, which has declared a holiday on Monday.        
	Apeejay Schools principal Rita Chatterjee, who is planning to ring the final bell early on Monday, seemed to sum up the citys sentiments: It will be another day of disruption; we are sick and tired of this.        
	If Fridays traffic snarls slowed the central business district down for four hours, police warned that things could be worse on Monday with most roads leading to Esplanade expected to fill up with rallyists from 11am and not be unclogged till the evening rush hour.        
	No wonder Welland Gouldsmith has asked students not to come to school if they have a tough time on the roads.        
	While schools like St James plan to give over by 10.30am, exams could keep the likes of Calcutta Girls and Birla High open a bit longer. Modern High School will be giving over at noon instead of 2.35pm.        
	Food for thought, Mr Bose?

                      Music and memories                    Arriving at Santiniketan as a 17-year old barely three weeks after the death of Tagore, Suchitra Mitra decided to devote her entire life to the songs of Rabindranath. Blessed with an unerring ear for music and a natural gift of voice and expression, she blossomed into perhaps the most flourishing proponent of these songs on being trained there by some of the greatest exponents Indira Devi Chaudhurani and Shantidev Ghosh. Today, she still remains the one of the most versatile and finest exponents and authorities on Rabindrasangeet. This evening, the grand old lady of Tagore songs will recount and share with the audience the wonderful, unforgettable experiences of her stay in Tagores abode of peace, friendship, music and learning. Besides touching upon memories of music lessons, she will reminisce about the sheer joy of life that she felt every moment amidst its pure, glorious and enchanting surroundings, and how her earnest involvement in Santiniketans many festivals and cultural programmes enormously enriched her spirit. The programme will be interspersed with readings by Subir Mitra, along with rendition of contextual Tagore songs by Anita Pal and other artistes. Also, a dance performance by Bimbavati Devi and dancers of Manipuri Nartanalaya. Overall concept: Amit Dasgupta. Hosted by Parampara.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Reward for work of lifetime
                              Rita Sen                            
	For Rita Sen, the National Award to Teachers came as the recognition of the work of a lifetime. The 59-year-old principal of Barrackpore Girls High School, due to retire in December 2010, has been with the school since 1984.         
	On September 5, Sen was one of seven from the state to receive the award, given by the ministry of human resource development in recognition of her work, at Vigyan Bhavan in Delhi. She was recommended by the West Bengal school education department.         
	Sen feels that a school should give equal importance on studies and extracurricular activity. So, quizzing, debating, theatre and dance feature prominently in the schools calendar.         
	Sen has come a long way from 1972, when she joined as assistant teacher at Biswanath Sriti Girls High School in Tribeni. The Class X life science teacher started spoken English classes in the Bengali-medium school seven years ago at the request of former students.         
	Some of my ex-students, who are doing well in their field and often travel abroad, urged me to start the classes. I agreed, for in todays age, one needs to be in touch with the outside world, she said. Fifty minutes are allotted every day to the classes, mandatory for all from classes V to XII.        
	Sen has given away the prize money of Rs 25,000 to her school to buy benches.                     JM

                      Society, psychology and suspense                    Inspired by the adventures of Byomkesh Bakshi, the sauve and soft-spoken Bengali investigator in Saradindu Bandyopadhyays detective novels, Checkmate is a thriller set in the turbulent Calcutta of the 1970s. It is a murder mystery set against the backdrop of the Naxalite movement, the Hippie cult and the gradual decadence of Bengali middle-class society. The play also addresses a number of existential issues under the garb of a whodunit. The main characters of the play, the detective, his wife and his publisher, are clearly influenced by characters created by Bandyopadhyay  Byomkesh, Satyabati and Ajit. Recreating the violent, amorous, complex, yet quintessentially Bengali social milieu which the author portrayed in his novels, the play also evokes nostalgia about a bygone era, albeit with its bitter-sweet references. Characterised by a gripping storyline that has its fair share of dramatic twists and turns, this production by Pandoras Act is embellished with a period soundscape that has works of Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen, Joan Baez and Simon amp; Garfunkel, along with an ensemble cast and crew and a blend of realistic and abstract sets. Drama and direction: Srijit Mukherji.                  Event: Play in English, Checkmate, produced by Pandoras Act When: May 15, 16 amp; 17 ; 6.30 pm Where: G.D. Birla Sabhagar

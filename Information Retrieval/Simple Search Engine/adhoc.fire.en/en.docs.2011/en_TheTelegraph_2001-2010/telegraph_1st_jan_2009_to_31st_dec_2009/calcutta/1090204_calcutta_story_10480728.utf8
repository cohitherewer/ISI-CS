The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Racket of postal papers busted
                                                                                                               Racket of postal papers busted
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The city police have busted a racket involved in preparing fake postal instruments, including Kisan Vikas Patras (KVPs), that were used for seeking bank loans.        
	The racket came to light on Monday when officers of Hare Street police station arrested Anirban Adhikari, 28, while he was waiting for a client on NS Road, near the GPO. Seventy-seven blank KVPs, each worth Rs 5,000, was found on him.         
	During interrogation, Adhikari admitted he was part of a gang that prepared fake KVPs and other postal instruments.         
	Anirbans elder brother Biplob is also a part of the racket, said Jawed Shamim, the city detective chief.         
	Biplob was arrested a few months back in connection with a fake currency racket and for stealing cheques and cashing them by opening bank accounts. He is now out on bail.        
	It appears that this gang is also involved in making fake postal instruments, said a detective department officer.         
	Anirban was carrying three fake voter ID cards, including one issued in Balasore, along with CESC bills, which were to be used for opening a bank account. The KVPs would have then been used to seek loans, said Shamim.        
	A resident of Dr AN Pal Road in Bally, Howrah, Anirban told the cops that a man named Sandip had given him the fake documents without revealing how and where they were prepared.        
	Sleuths said Anirban and his gang had realised that following recent reports about corporate fraud and the economic meltdown, most banks would ask for collaterals from loan applicants. The gang wanted to cash in on the demand for such documents among those looking for speedy loans.        
	Sleuths said associates of Anirban and Biplob were spread across Calcutta. They would tip off the two about courier agents carrying high-value cheques.        
	The gang would take into confidence courier boys, steal the cheques and encash them. There were a few such incidents in the city last year, after which Biplob was arrested, said an officer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Why we the people must guard the greens from the government
                                                                                                               Why we the people must guard the greens from the government

	Beware, Team Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is at it again. After robbing us of our right to breathe clean air, the government has now cast its rapacious eye on Calcuttas most precious patch of green.        
	The governments petition to the defence ministry for possessional right of the Maidan  the army is its sole custodian  and state transport Subhas Chakrabortys follow-up meeting with defence minister A.K. Antony have unmasked the governments motives about the Maidan.        
	What the government cannot do because of judicial intervention, it is trying to do through the backdoor, warns green activist Subhash Dutta.         
	Metro explores why we must save the Maidan from the government.        
	What makes the Maidan so important?        
	It is the citys lungs.        
	At 620-odd hectares, the Maidan constitutes 61 per cent of Calcuttas public open space. That makes this patch of green in the heart of the city integral to the health and general wellbeing of its population.        
	According to international standards, an urban population size of 1,000 requires at least seven acres of open space. A committee appointed by the high court in 2000 found the citys organised open space to be less than 1 per cent of its area.        
	New Delhis organised open space is 8.49 per cent of its area and Bangalores is 8.60 per cent.        
	 Take away the Maidan and you take away the little breathing space that the city is left with, says Dutta, whose petition had led the high court to shift the Book Fair, ban the use of chullahs within a 3-km radius of Victoria Memorial and turn the Maidan area into a no-parking zone.              
	What will the government do if it gains control?        
	Maul and murder the Maidan.        
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee could bring the Book Fair back to the Maidan  he has been sulking about it being shifted out under court orders allowing a million feet to trample on the greens again. Political rallies will be held every other day, turning the green belt into a kitchen-cum-dormitory-cum-toilet. Sprawling parking lots will spring up on the Maidan, to be used by vehicles that ferry people to the ground on rally and fair days and by buses, taxis and two-wheelers on rest days.        
	Subhas Chakraborty, whose plans include closing down the racecourse because a valuable place is being used for bogus things, will have a field day. He might even organise a soiree with his own army to celebrate the victory.              
	Why does the army need to be in charge of the Maidan?        
	To safeguard it from the politicians.        
	The Maidan is officially divided into three zones  red, blue and yellow. The red zone is the Victoria Memorial area, the blue zone includes Brigade Parade Ground, Shahid Minar and the playgrounds under the armys control. The state government manages the yellow zone, including Curzon Park and the indoor stadium.        
	 Take a look at the yellow zone and you will know what will happen if the government takes charge of the other two zones as well, says Dutta.        
	This is not the first time that the government is trying to wrest control of the red and blue zones of the Maidan.        
	In 2003, pleader Rabilal Moitra (now the law minister) tried to convince the high court that the Maidan was originally under the state government and should be handed back to it. Thankfully, the court rejected the petition, recalls Dutta.              
	What will be the environmental implications of a mauled Maidan?        
	Disastrous.        
	A green belt works like a sink into which all the dust and carbon dioxide goes, keeping the air relatively clean. A city shorn of its last remaining green oasis will become a gas chamber.        
	Shrinking greenery also means warmer climate, even in winter.        
	Apart from the obvious impacts like loss of biodiversity, lack of green spaces in an urban setting can have a psychosomatic effect on residents. Stress levels will rise and claustrophobia will set in, says neurosurgeon Swapan Kumar Mondal.

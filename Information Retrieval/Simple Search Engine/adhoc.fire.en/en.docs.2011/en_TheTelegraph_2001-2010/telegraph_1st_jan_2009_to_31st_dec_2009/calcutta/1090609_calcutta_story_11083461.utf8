The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Flu docs drag back suspect
                                                                                                               Flu docs drag back suspect
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A team of officials brought swine flu suspect Sutapa Bhattacharya back to the Infectious Diseases Hospital late on Monday, around 44 hours after she had walked out for being quarantined in an unhygienic isolation ward without treatment.        
	Eight medical officials landed at 46-year-old Sutapas Kalyani residence around 8.30pm, allegedly bundled her into an ambulance and drove off.        
	Officials of the Beleghata hospital had agreed to let Sutapa return to the hospital on her own on Tuesday but changed their decision later and forced her to accompany them, said husband Debesh.        
	Sutapa returned from a holiday in Singapore with her family on Saturday night and was quarantined immediately because she had fever.         
	Like NRI Sushmita Biswas and her two-year-old son Gibson, who had spent three nights last month in a mosquito-infested ward of the hospital before testing negative for swine flu, the Kalyani homemaker was put in a dirty ward and allegedly not even examined.        
	The doctors admitted that they did not find any swine flu symptom other than mild breathing trouble. Then why are they taking me back to the hospital? cried Sutapa on Monday evening.        
	Debesh, a bank official, said he feared his wife would be taken ill if she stayed in that dirty ward.        
	Sutapas brother-in-law, a doctor, followed her to the hospital on Monday to make sure she is not kept untreated in unhygienic conditions.        
	Aniruddha Kar, the director of health services, said Sutapa would have to stay in hospital at least till her swine-flu test results were known.

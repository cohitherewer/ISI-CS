The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | School children on Maidan mission
                                                                                                               School children on Maidan mission
          KARO CHRISTINE KUMAR                          Khalsa High School students clean up a Maidan water body on Sunday. PWD minister Kshiti Goswami had joined the students on Thursday                                  
	For three weeks, 70 students of Khalsa High School have been queuing up for morning attendance not on their school ground but in the middle of the Maidan.        
	After their names are marked on the register, the boys and girls in blue-and-grey uniform roll up their sleeves and slip on gloves. For they have volunteered to clean the lungs of the city.        
	Instead of taking attendance in school, we take it on the Maidan. That way all the students are present, says Satnam Singh Ahluwalia, the secretary of the school.        
	The result? A much cleaner Maidan in less than a month.        
	The Maidan has changed so much from the first day we came here. We pull out weeds and dried-up plants and collect discarded glass and plastic bottles. It feels good to do social work, says Pawan Kumar Pandey, a Class XII student of the school.        
	On Sunday, too, 40 students were at work on the greens, clearing hyacinths from a water body opposite Chatterjee International Centre.        
	Because of the effort of the students and the teachers, the Maidan is a different place today. You can actually see the water body from the main road. During the clean-up, we have found an old fountain under debris. We are planning to revive the fountain, says Mudar Patherya, a green activist associated with the drive.        
	The fountain of youth that has sustained the campaign. Different sections of different classes of the Bhawanipur school turn up each day for Operation Clean-up. The students have already covered 50,000sq ft, between Park Street Metro station and Elliot Park.        
	Action is always better than words. The drive has imbued students with a sense of cleanliness. Now, they are aware that they must not litter. Earlier they would throw away food wrappers, now they are self-conscious, says Parminder Kaur, the headmistress.        
	After working two hours, either from 6am to 8am or 7am to 9am, the students take the Metro back to school. We are penning a pledge that the students will take during morning assembly after the clean-up drive is over. We have dedicated this clean-up to Guru Nanaks birth anniversary on November 2, says Ahluwalia.        
	Students of MC Kejriwal Vidyapeeth lent a helping hand to Khalsa High School students on October 11.

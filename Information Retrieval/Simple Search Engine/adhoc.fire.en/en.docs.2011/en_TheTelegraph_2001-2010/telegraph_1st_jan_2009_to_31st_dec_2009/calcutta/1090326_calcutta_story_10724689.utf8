	The environment department on Wednesday banned polluting vessels on state waterways after a prod from the Union government.        
	Nearly 100 vessels that broke down and were left on the Hooghly, perennially polluting the water, will face penal measures if the ban is implemented.        
	More than 50 of these vessels can be found between Jagannath Ghat and Rajabagan dockyard.        
	Though official data are not available, a large percentage of vessels plying in the state violate pollution norms.        
	Following an order from the director-general of shipping, a wing of the ministry of shipping, road transport and highways, the state environment department issued a notification, under the Environment (Protection) Act, prohibiting polluting vessels on waterways.        
	The notification was issued to combat oil spills and other forms of pollution by vessels. If they fail to adhere to the norms, they will be penalised, said M.L. Meena, the secretary of the environment department.        
	The director-general of shipping, Lakshmi Venkatchalam, earlier wrote to state chief secretary Ashok Mohan Chakrabarti stating that according to the international protocol for prevention of pollution from ships ratified by India, all vessels registered under Inland Vessels Act, 1917, need to comply with pollution control norms laid down by Merchant Shipping Act, 1958.        
	The ministry was activated by a Bombay High Court order in connection with pollution on Goa beaches as a result of oil spill.        
	We have received the central directive and are currently finding out how many vessels need to be scrapped, said a transport department official.        
	According to him, about 200 vessels of the state surface transport corporation, Central Inland Water Transport Corporation and the Inland Waterways Authority of India ply in the state.        
	Officials of Calcutta Port Trust, which keeps tab on non-propelled vessels, were clueless about the number of such vessels in the state.        
	There are around 1,500 wooden non-propelled vessels and 150 non-wooden non-propelled vessels, said a source.        
	We use the space around Babughat and an area near Tribeni for parking our vessels, said Praful Tayal, the chairman and managing director of the Central Inland Water Transport Corporation, which has close to 100 vessels.        
	Some of the vessels in Babughat have broken down but we have not been granted funds to repair them, added Tayal. Oil and grease leaks into the river from the vessels. Corrosion of their metal body also contributes to pollution.        
	This is an important directive as till date not much has been done about vessels polluting the water, said Biswajit Mukherjee, the chief law officer of the environment department.

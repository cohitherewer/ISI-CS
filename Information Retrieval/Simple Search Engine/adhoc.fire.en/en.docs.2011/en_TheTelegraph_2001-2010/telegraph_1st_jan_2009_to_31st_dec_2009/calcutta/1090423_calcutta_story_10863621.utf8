          OUR BUREAU                          A weary student on his way back from school on Wednesday afternoon. Picture by Pabitra Das                                        
	Schools in the city are starting their day early, truncating classes and serving energy drinks to give heat-struck students some respite from the cruellest April in nearly three decades.  
	Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School has declared Thursday and Friday as half-days and four other private institutes have announced summer timings to ensure that their students come in early when the sun is milder and leave before the mercury peaks.        
	The heat is unbearable and regular power cuts have doubled its effect. Students have been taking ill regularly; we had to send a few students home on Wednesday, said Malini Bhagat, the principal of Mahadevi Birla.        
	The weather forecast being grim, St James, Calcutta Girls and St Xaviers Collegiate have also decided to trim their schedules. Classes will start at 7.15am instead of 7.45am from Monday and give over at 12.30pm instead of 1.30pm, announced Neville Holt, the senior co-ordinator of St James.                
	The summer schedule of St Xaviers Collegiate includes one break less and shorter classes. School will start at 8.30am instead of 9am and give over at 1pm, two hours earlier than normal. We have shortened some classes by five minutes, said Merlin DSouza, the co-ordinator of the schools senior section.          
	Most of the private schools that have decided to stick to the normal schedule are the ones with air-conditioned classrooms. Our students arent facing any problem. We have only shifted our physical education classes to the hall, said Mukta Nain, the principal of Birla High School for Boys.        
	Some schools have arranged for energy drinks to prevent students and staff members from suffering dehydration. Heritage School, which is centrally air-conditioned, has been serving lemonade twice a day.         
	Vivekananda Mission School has stocked a saline solution for students who take ill, said principal Keya Sinha.         
	Will the schools declare a heat holiday if the mercury rises further? It is difficult to manage with 240 working days, So, its best if we can make do with a change in timings. We have advanced ours by 15 minutes, said Reeta Chatterjee, the principal of Apeejay.

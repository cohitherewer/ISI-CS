	The security system of Calcuttas transport lifeline is graduating from beep and scan to sniff and wag.        
	After 27 air-conditioned coaches, an automatic signalling system and upgraded surveillance cameras, Metro Railway is investing close to Rs 2.5 lakh on two Labrador pups to lead a canine squad trained to sniff out any bomb threat to the tracks.        
	Cute, barely five months old, and Rex, two months older, are being groomed for training at the Railway Protection Force (RPF) kennel in Narkeldanga. The duo are scheduled to leave for Gwalior soon on a special rail coach to undergo rigorous training for 24 weeks.        
	So why has Metro Railway woken up to the need for a dedicated sniffer squad after doing without one for 25 years? The times are changing, and we are expanding our network as well. So far, we would hire sniffer dogs from Calcutta police whenever we needed them. But it has become necessary to have our own squad, especially with the police sniffer dogs being saddled with so many assignments, said a Metro official.        
	According to an RPF official, Cute and Rex will be trained by experts at the Border Security Force dog school at Tekanpur, near Gwalior, to give confirmatory signals without barking whenever they detect an explosive device.        
	Sound-sensitive explosives are the latest threat, and sniffer dogs need to be trained to give signals without barking so that these bombs dont go off, he added.                          
	Metro Railway paid a city-based dog breeder Rs 28,000 for Cute and Rex. Another Rs 2 lakh will be spent on their training.        
	The cost includes the fees of three handlers who will be escorting them to Gwalior, said an official.        
	Life for Cute and Rex has been anything but puppy love even before they face the rigours of field duty.         
	They were initially fed four times a day but now they get only two meals a day, though their calorie intake remains the same, the RPF official said.        
	The duos calorie requirement comes from meat, milk, eggs, rice, vegetable, breads, chappatis and dog food. They are apparently being trained to make do with two meals a day so that they can work long hours without food, if the need arises.        
	The pups, who have been in Narkeldanga since they were a little over a month old, will get a new home on the Metro Railway campus near Belgachhia station after returning from training.        
	The dog squads of various security agencies include German Shepherds and Doberman Pinschers but Labradors are the favourites.        
	Labradors are the best of the lot on several counts, especially intelligence and loyalty, said a handler.        
	Metro Railways decision to raise a dog squad is part of a derailed expansion plan that has been recently brought back on track.         
	Over the next 10 months, nearly Rs 1,000 crore worth of projects will be implemented to give commuters faster, safer rides in air-conditioned comfort by next Puja.        
	Metro Railway intends increasing the peak-hour frequency of trains to two minutes once more rakes are pressed into service.

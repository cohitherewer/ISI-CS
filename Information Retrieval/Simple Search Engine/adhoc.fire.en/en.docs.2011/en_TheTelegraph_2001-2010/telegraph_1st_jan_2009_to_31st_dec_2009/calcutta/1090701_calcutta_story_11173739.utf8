                      Revival of Odissi tradition                    An annual Hindu festival, Rath Yatra or Car Festival celebrates the journey of Lord Jagannath to his aunts home and his return to his own abode. A festival which shuns discrimination based on caste or creed, it is a symbol of the essential equality of mankind. Utkala, the cultural wing of Sri Jagannath Seva Samiti, Calcutta, is celebrating the spirit of Rath Yatra with a colourful Orissa Festival showcasing the music, dance and other folk and classical art forms of Orissa. This evening, Aloka Kanungo (picture here) and the students of Shinjan Nrityalaya present an Odissi performance, bringing down the curtains on the week-long cultural extravaganza. Having evolved under the patronage of Puris Jagannath Temple, Odissi dance is very much a part of Orissas ancient religious tradition. Temple dancers (maharis) performed within its premises and gotipuas (male dancers) danced outside it during ceremonies. The two items to be performed this evening, Nritya Vilash and Mahavidya, will showcase these age-old traditions. The presentation will also feature Bandhya Nritya, an acrobatic style of Odissi, and Sabdya Nritya, a form on the verge of extinction. Participants: Arpita Venkatesh, Srabanti Bhattacharya, Sangeeta Talapatra, Triparna Bhattacharya, Surendra Pradhan and Raghunath Pradhan. Choreography and direction: Aloka Kanungo.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Factory blaze next to airport
                                                                                                               Factory blaze next to airport

	A fire broke out in an illegal paint factory about 25 metres from the airport and surrounded by residential buildings for the third time in five years on Monday morning.        
	The flames leapt as high as five floors, prompting airport firefighters to join hands with fire brigade personnel to put out the blaze.        
	Three Air India planes parked in the hangar nearest to the Kaikhali factory were shifted, the walls of the airport sprayed with water and the aged and ailing evacuated from adjacent buildings on stretchers.        
	Sixteen fire tenders rushed to the factory from 10am, an hour after residents of a nearby housing estate saw thick black fumes emanating from the factory.        
	The firemen had to draw water from the estates swimming pool after running out of other options.        
	Three of the five crash fire tenders the airport had imported last year joined the operation later. Those on the tenders sprayed foam from inside the airport compound into the flames, which leapt so close to the adjoining buildings that residents rushed out with LPG cylinders.        
	If the breeze helped the fire cross a 10ft wide road to an adjacent chemical factory, the flames would have reached the hangars, said an airport fireman.        
	The fire started from stored chemicals and was brought under control around 2pm, said Bibhas Guha, the divisional fire officer. By then, the damage had run into lakhs and a labourer had suffered minor burns.        
	The local fire station was not equipped to fight chemical fires and sought our help, said an airport official.         
	According to fire brigade officers, the factory had been issued a fire licence but it is no longer valid since the unit does not have a trade licence.        
	No one lodged a complaint with us about the factory running illegally. It is not our duty to check whether a factory has a licence or not, said an officer of airport police station.        
	Tapas Chatterjee, the chairman of the Rajarhat-Gopalpur municipality, said the factory was allowed to operate since it employed about 60 people. We will take stern action against the factory now.        
	Residents alleged more than 25 factories in the area stored inflammable goods without taking precautions.        
	Officials of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) alleged that they had repeatedly complained to the civic authorities about illegal structures near the airport. In our meetings with the environment management committee, headed by the state chief secretary, we have pointed out the illegal buildings, said an AAI official.        
	The Air Traffic Control warned pilots of aircraft flying to Calcutta about the fire.

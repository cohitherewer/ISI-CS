The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tug-of-war for city centre
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Tug-of-war for city centre
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Mamata Banerjee are set to end the year just as they had begun it  fighting a turf war in which no matter who wins, the Calcuttan will be the loser.        
	Both Citu and the Trinamul Congress are eyeing the city centre for traffic-choker rallies on December 31, triggering a war of words over which side applied for permission first and whose cause is greater.        
	Police said the Citu-affiliated All India Bidi Workers Federation applied for permission to hold a rally starring the chief minister a month ago. Trinamul, on the other hand, wrote to Lalbazar two days ago seeking a nod to hold a five-day programme starting Tuesday at the Metro channel to commemorate Mamatas 26-day hunger strike in 2006 over land acquisition in Singur.        
	The current practice is to allow those who approach us first to hold a rally at the Metro channel. In this case, the Bidi Workers Federation approached us much before the Trinamul Congress did, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters), Jawed Shamim, told Metro.        
	So how does Lalbazar intend following the norm (and obliging Citu) without rubbing Mamata the wrong way?        
	We have asked the Trinamul to alter its schedule because it clashes with the bidi workers programme on January 31, Shamim said.        
	Kali Ghosh, the state secretary of Citu, said on Monday that the bidi workers rally would be held at the Metro channel, come what may.        
	The Citu leader hoped good sense would prevail in the Trinamul camp and its leaders would shift the hunger strike anniversary programme elsewhere. We cannot change the venue at this juncture since we have carried out a month-long campaign for the rally, in which the chief minister will be the main speaker, he added.        
	But will Trinamul back down in this battle of egos? Trinamul Youth Congress chief Madan Mitra said the police were asking his party to curtail the proposed five-day programme to two just to please Citu. How can the police dictate to us what the duration of our programme should be? he demanded.        
	Mitra claimed that the party applied for police permission a week ago and not two days back. In any case, the police cannot deny permission to the Trinamul netri (Mamata) to commemorate her 26-day hunger strike at the Metro channel, he added.         
	The Trinamul leader advised Citu to learn a lesson from a religious organisation that suspended a rally slated for Tuesday at the Metro channel to express solidarity with Mamata di.         
	A source said the railway minister, who was informed about the Metro channel muddle hours before she left for Delhi on Monday, expressed her displeasure over arm-twisting by Citu.        
	If Citu resorts to force to get us to shift our programme from Metro channel, then we will hit the streets in protest, said a Trinamul leader.        
	Till late on Monday, there was no confirmation of whether the police would crack down on Trinamul workers if they stayed put at the Metro channel on December 31.        
	Either way, it means Metro channel will be out of bounds for the Calcuttan on the last day of 2009. Holiday crowds descending on the city centre, beware.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Seal on water snap for default
                                                                                                               Seal on water snap for default
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                                            
	Pay up or go dry  thats the choice before property tax defaulters in the city.        
	A seven-year legal battle ended on Monday, with the high court upholding the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC)s authority to snap the water lines of premises defaulting on property tax.        
	The division bench of Justice Asim Banerjee and Justice Prosenjit Mondal, whose verdict gave a boost to the CMCs efforts to realise the outstanding tax, struck down an earlier order of the court that had termed any attempt to cut off a defaulters water lines as unconstitutional.        
	After considering all facts, this court is setting aside the judgment passed by the trial court and upholding the Calcutta Municipal Corporations decision to recover due property taxes by applying the provisions laid down in the CMC Act, the bench ruled.        
	According to an estimate of the civic revenue department, around 2,300 residential and commercial premises owe the civic authorities more than Rs 500 crore in property tax. Some of the premises have been defaulting since 1976.        
	This is a landmark judgment which will help the civic body mop up longstanding dues, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.        
	Mondays order followed a petition by the CMC in the Supreme Court challenging the earlier order of the high court. The apex court then directed the high court to hear the case afresh.        
	Section 275(1)(aa) of the CMC Act, 1980, empowers the civic authorities to take punitive action, such as discontinuing water supply, to realise outstanding property tax.        
	Civic officials said the section was first invoked in 2001, when mayor Subrata Mukherjee realised more than Rs 45 crore in outstanding property tax by snapping the water lines of some prominent hotels and other business establishments.        
	A defaulting private firm, Nilambar Finvest, had moved the high court in 2002, challenging the the legality of Section 275(1)(aa).        
	The company termed the section unconstitutional and argued that since water was on the list of essential services, the CMC could not stop its supply under any circumstance.        
	Ashok Das Adhikary, counsel for the civic body, said Nilambar Finvest had been issued a notice under Section 275(1)(aa) of the CMC Act which stated that water connection to its premises would be cut off if it did not cough up outstanding property tax of Rs 55,000.        
	Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya, who was hearing the petition, ruled in favour of the the petitioner.        
	The civic body moved an appeal in the apex court challenging Justice Bhattacharyas judgment the same year and the case was referred back to the high court.        
	Metro had earlier reported, quoting civic records, that prominent defaulters at various points of time included the railways, banks, stadiums, hospitals and government offices.

          A STAFF REPORTER                        Jyoti Basu signs the first form of Pranam at Indira Bhavan; Suchitra Sen (below) was the second senior citizen to sign up (for the 24-hour helpline (signature on the form circled) at her Ballygunge Circular Road home.

	Form No. 1: The citys most famous senior citizen.        
	Form No. 2: The citys most elusive senior citizen.        
	Jyoti Basu and Suchitra Sen were the first two Calcuttans to sign up for Pranam, a 24-hour helpline for senior citizens unveiled this weekend.        
	The project is a joint initiative of Calcutta police and The Bengal, a year-old organisation of prominent Calcuttans.        
	At 11.30am on Saturday, the 94-year-old politician signed the first form in the presence of writer Sunil Gangopadhyay, police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti and Sundeep Bhutoria, the secretary-general of The Bengal, at his Salt Lake residence.         
	A few hours later, the 78-year-old actress-turned-recluse signed the second form  behind closed doors, of course  at her Ballygunge Circular Road residence.         
	For this work I congratulate you people, said the former chief minister, who turns 95 on July 8. Such a project can really benefit the elderly in the city.... I hope there is an office, said Basu, and seemed reassured when told there was one at Ballygunge police station.        
	At the Sen home, daughter Moon Moon handed over the form signed by Suchitra. It is a good initiative by the police and a voluntary organisation, especially for senior citizens who live alone. Its the first such project and I wish it luck, she told Metro.        
	At the official launch of Pranam, by Ray favourites Soumitra Chatterjee and Madhabi Mukherjee, on Saturday evening at Ballygunge police station, top cop Chakrabarti said: It will be a unique project, but the police alone cannot make this a success. I appeal to all senior citizens to come forward and register themselves, so that we can help them feel secure.        
	The helpline is an attempt to reach out to the elderly in a city that often resembles an old-age home because of the lack of opportunties for the youth. Pranam will give them the psychological support that they need, said Bhutoria.        
	Priority medical support should come from the 15 private hospitals that comprise the Association of Hospitals of Eastern India. Whenever there is an emergency call, we will try and rush our ambulance along with a doctor. Hospitals will admit patients after assessing their needs and the facilities available, said Pradip Tondon, the president of the association.        
	As for the financial aspect, hospitals will provide support to the extent possible. If the patient is not in a position to bear the cost of a private hospital, after support and stabilisation, he will be transferred to a government hospital.        
	To register with Pranam from July 1, senior citizens staying alone or with spouse, must approach their local police station. The helpline number is 24190740, the fax number is 24190741.

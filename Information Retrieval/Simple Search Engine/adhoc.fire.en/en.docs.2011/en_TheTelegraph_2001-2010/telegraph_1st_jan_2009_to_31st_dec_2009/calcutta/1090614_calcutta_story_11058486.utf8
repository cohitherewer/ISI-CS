	The best way to beat the sweltering heat and humidity is to head for the hills, and what better way to do so than in regal style! Himachal Pradesh offers tourists the grandeur of its snow-capped mountains, natures bounty as well as beautiful old palaces. Most visitors to this abode of snow make the usual round of Shimla, Kullu and Manali. But to experience royal splendour we made a trip to Chail and stayed at Palace Hotel, a heritage hotel run by the Himachal Tourism Development Corporation, and kept on the royal trail.         
	Chail is about 45 km from Shimla via Kufri through thick forests of oak, chir pine and deodar. The green cover is interspersed with bright red rhododendrons. Chail was the summer capital of the former princely state of Patiala and the Palace Hotel is housed in the Maharajas mansion on Rajgarh hill.                   royal route: Naggar Castle (above) and Chail Palace             
	Built in 1891, it has all the trappings that Indian royalty was once heir to. The palace reflects the gone-by era with its imposing structures, richly decorated interiors with magnificent chandeliers, huge mirrors with carved frames, lavish paintings, rich carpets, elegant drapes, antique furniture and even a grand piano. The hotel is a blend of Western and Indian styles.         
	The palace complex is spread over 75 acres and has beautiful flowerbeds, firs, chinars, magnolias and deodars. We sat on an elegant swing in the lawn and savoured the old-world charm and surrounding scenic beauty.         
	Close by is the highest cricket ground in the world at 7,500ft. It was built in 1893 after levelling the top of a hill. We stood on the cricket ground, marvelling how such a feat could be accomplished. One can also visit Sidh Baba Ka Mandir and Mahakali Mandir. Wildlife enthusiasts can visit the nearby Chail Sanctuary.         
	The palace offers a wide variety of accommodation, including maharaja and maharani suites, deluxe rooms, cottages and log huts (outside Palace Hotel but within the complex) with tariffs to suit all pockets. Visitors are allowed inside Palace Hotel for a fee.         
	Our next destination was Manali. About 22 km from Manali is Naggar, which was the capital of the former princely state of Kullu for over 1,400 years.         
	High above the left bank of the Beas river, resting on a wooded slope and surrounded by lofty snow-capped mountains, stands the grand Castle Fort, built in the early 16th century. We were wonder-struck by the splendour of the medieval castle. Built of rough stone and old wood around a courtyard, bordered with intricately carved balconies, the castle offers a breathtaking view of the valley with the meandering Beas down below.         
	This historic castle is also being run as a heritage hotel by Himachal Tourism. The rooms are tastefully furnished. We got up at dawn and experienced an unforgettable sunrise from our balcony, as a rosy hue tinged the snow-capped mountains. Later in the morning, we visited a small temple in the courtyard. There is a slab named Jagtipatt here, which is highly revered. We enjoyed our breakfast sitting in an upper storey balcony overlooking the valley while a gentle breeze caressed our faces.         
	Close to the castle is the beautiful grey sandstone Gauri Shankar temple, the pagoda shaped Tripura Sundri Temple and the famous Nicholas Roerich Art Gallery. We ambled along the winding roads and came across quaint little shops selling exotic fruit wines. The Beas trout is also a delicacy here. Anglers can go trout fishing at various points on the Beas.

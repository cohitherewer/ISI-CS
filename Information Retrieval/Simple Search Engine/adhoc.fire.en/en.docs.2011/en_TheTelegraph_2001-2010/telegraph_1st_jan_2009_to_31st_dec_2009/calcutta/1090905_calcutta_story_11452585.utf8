The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Six in fraud net
                                                                                                               Six in fraud net
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Six men, including an accountant of a nationalised bank, were arrested on Friday for allegedly withdrawing nearly Rs 50 lakh from the bank by submitting forged cheques.        
	The six allegedly transferred over Rs 1 crore from the account of the West Bengal Power Development Corporation to their account but could withdraw only Rs 48 lakh before being caught.        
	Joint commissioner (headquarters) Jawed Shamim said Nitai Tapadar, an accountant in the Stephen House branch of Allahabad Bank, played a key role in the fraud.        
	Tapadar identified the power development corporation account to the members of the racket as one from which a huge sum could be withdrawn. He also passed the forged cheques, said an investigator.        
	According to police, Tridib Das, in his early 40s, was the mastermind of the operation.        
	Apart from Tapadar and Das, Pradip Shaw, Manas Chakrabarty, Asit Deb and Sanjay Chowdhury were arrested. Cops have so far recovered only Rs 1.54 lakh.

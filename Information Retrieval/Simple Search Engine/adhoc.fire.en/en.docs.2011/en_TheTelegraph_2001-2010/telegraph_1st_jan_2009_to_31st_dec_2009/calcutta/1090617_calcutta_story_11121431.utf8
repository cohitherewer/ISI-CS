The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | JU cold feet over fee-hike move
                                                                                                               JU cold feet over fee-hike move
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The Jadavpur University authorities are in no mood to bell the fee-hike cat at a crucial executive council meeting on Wednesday.        
	On the eve of the meeting, the buzz on the campus was that a 500 per cent hike was set to be tabled.        
	But an executive council member told Metro late on Tuesday that the authorities would not dare risk a backlash over fee hike at this juncture.        
	There is no way that the authorities are going to take up the fee-hike issue this year, said the official, on condition of anonymity.        
	According to sources in the university, the authorities developed cold feet fearing that the fee hike would trigger trouble and student unrest at a time when the CPM-led government is struggling to cope with the poll debacle and is busy fighting political fires in various parts of the state.        
	There is no doubt that a fee hike is long overdue and we need to raise the fees because the university is totally dependent on state government aid and needs to increase its own source of income, said a JU faculty member. But the time is not right, given the political uncertainty in Bengal.        
	In January, the executive council had set up a nine-member committee, headed by pro vice-chancellor Siddhartha Dutta, to work out the fee hike for the arts, science and engineering faculties. Their report was to be placed at Wednesdays meeting.        
	The fee hike, if it was passed, would have been the first revision at the university in eight years. Postgraduate and undergraduate students of the engineering faculty now pay a monthly fee of Rs 200, students in science courses pay Rs 150 and those studying BA or MA pay Rs 75.        
	Dutta said that the university would not take any steps that would inconvenience students or guardians as there are many from the rural areas as well as from lower and middle class families on campus.        
	Student unions on campus were not taking any chances on Tuesday and gearing up to protest the fee-hike proposal. In a fee review committee meeting last week it was proposed that there would be a 500 per cent fee hike. We are going to protest against the decision, said a student.        
	Dutta however stressed that no decision regarding the fee hike had been taken as the report was incomplete. There are many components of the fee-hike process for which we have to take the views of students, teachers, research scholars and guardians, he said.

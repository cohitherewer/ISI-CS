                                                                                                               Parents hopes die young
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Ashok Manna had saved as much as he could to send both his sons  Arindam and Animesh  to St Thomas School, opposite which he ran a tea stall.        
	Wife Malati used to make paper bags as Ashoks income was not enough to fund the education of their sons, who did go to the Dasnagar school, and daughter Antara, who studied in Netaji Girls High School in Dasnagar.        
	I wanted my sons to study hard and be like the other boys of the school. Arindam realised my dream But I never imagined he would leave us thus, cried the 62-year-old, who still runs the tea stall.        
	My sons told me several times to close down the shop. But I refused as it brought us good luck and changed our lives, he added, sitting in the drawing room of the single-storeyed house the sub-inspector son had built with a bank loan.        
	Around 11.30am on Wednesday, the Mannas learnt that Arindam was found dead on a railway track in Mankundu.         
	We were preparing for his marriage. Now, we are waiting for his body, said Soma Senapati, a relative, as an inconsolable Malati lost consciousness once again on Thursday afternoon.         
	Relatives and friends trickled into the neatly done house, which got a fresh coat of paint last month, recalling their memories of Arindam, better known to them as Bachchu.         
	I saw the couples struggle in their early lives to ensure education for their children. They were so happy when Arindam got the Government Railway Police job, said Malatis younger brother Jiten Pal.         
	After school, Arindam did B.Com (honours) from Goenka College of Commerce and Business Administration. Brother Animesh  seven years junior to Arindam  did engineering from a private college last year and is now working in Bilaspur.         
	Arindam was very sincere and responsible to his family members. He started giving tuition since his school days He shouldered most of the expenses of Antaras marriage two years ago, recalled Jiten.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Poll toll on transport
                                                                                                               Poll toll on transport
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	City commuters will feel the poll pinch from Monday when public transport will be trimmed to a trickle.        
	Around 2,300 taxis will be On Election Duty from Tuesday but many more will be off the road from the day before.         
	Close to 5,000 taxis will be withdrawn from Monday as the owners do not want to risk last-minute requisition, said Bengal Taxi Association secretary Bimal Guha. To add to the commuters woes, 30 per cent of the 8,000-odd buses and 4,000 minibuses will be off the road.        
	The shortage will be on beyond Thursday as the requisitioned vehicles will not be returned at one go, said a source.

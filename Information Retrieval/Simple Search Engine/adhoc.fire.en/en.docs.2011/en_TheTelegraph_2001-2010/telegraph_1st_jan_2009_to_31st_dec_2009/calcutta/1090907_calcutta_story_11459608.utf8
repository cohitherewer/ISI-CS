The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rain alert for 48 hours
                                                                                                               Rain alert for 48 hours
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The city and its neighbourhood will receive significant rainfall over the next couple of days but with steadily decreasing intensity, the Met office said on Sunday.        
	In the 24 hours since 8.30pm on Saturday, the city received 89.7mm of rain, the highest since May 25 (93.1mm) when cyclone Aila ravaged large parts of south Bengal.        
	The deep depression that caused heavy rainfall across south Bengal over the past two days was moving deeper into Jharkhand, weakening on the way.        
	At 2.30pm on Sunday, the system was centred 50km northeast of Ranchi. It is likely to move further in the northwesterly direction and weaken gradually, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	Though the weatherman predicted showers of lower intensity over the next two days, heavy to very heavy showers could not be ruled out in some parts of Gangetic Bengal.        
	Saturdays showers left 30 trees uprooted. Two persons were injured when a tree on SC Mullick Road fell on a settlement of civic labourers. A Sirish tree fell on Jawaharlal Nehru Road between Park Street and Maidan Metro stations. Trees were also uprooted in Topsia, Mominpur, Behala and east Calcutta.        
	Chief engineer (civil) Debasish Chakraborty said all uprooted trees were cut into pieces and removed.

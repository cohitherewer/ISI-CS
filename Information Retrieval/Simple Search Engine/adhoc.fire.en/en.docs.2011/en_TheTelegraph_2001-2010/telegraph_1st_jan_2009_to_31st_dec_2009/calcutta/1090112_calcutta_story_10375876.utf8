The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Youths held for girl abduction
                                                                                                               Youths held for girl abduction
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Cops from Bihar arrested a young man in Howrah on Sunday for allegedly abducting a girl five days before she turned 18 and forcibly marrying her.        
	Safia Parvez, who became an adult 12 days ago, said she had married Shahid Imam, 24, of her own accord.        
	The two and Shahids 35-year-old brother Mohammad Khalid Kamal, a ticket examiner with Eastern Railway, were picked up from their Alam Mistri Lane home on the basis of a complaint by her father Parvez Akhtar.        
	They were produced in the Howrah chief judicial magistrates court. The brothers were then taken to Nalanda in Bihar on transit remand. They will be produced in the chief judicial magistrates court in Nalanda on Monday.        
	Safia told the judge that she wanted to stay with her in-laws in their house in Alam Mistri Lane.        
	According to Shahids advocate Sukanta Ghosh, he and Safia, a first-year BCA student in Nalanda, were in touch ever since he had mistakenly dialled her number a year ago. Three months ago, Shahid had visited Nalanda and met her near her college.        
	On December 26, 2008, the couple married under the Special Marriage Act. Akhtar lodged a complaint with Baktiarpur police station recently alleging that Shahid had abducted his daughter while she was a minor.        
	About 4am on Sunday, a team from Baktiarpur police station, accompanied by officers of Golabari police station, raided Shahids house to pick up the three.         
	Khalid has been falsely implicated in the case. His name was not mentioned in the FIR filed by Safias father. Yet, he was taken to Nalanda by the police, added Ghosh.

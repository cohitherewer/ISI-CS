The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Drug-and-rob masseuse held
                                                                                                               Drug-and-rob masseuse held
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 45-year-old who would masquerade as a masseuse to enter homes she intended robbing and drug her victims was arrested on Thursday for causing the death of an elderly woman she had targeted last year.        
	Police said Manju Das had confessed to using dhatura seeds to sedate Sushma Niyogi and her sibling Uma Banerjee, both in their seventies, and robbing their Manoharpukur Road apartment in the Lake area in April 2008.         
	Sushma died after spending three days in a nursing home.        
	Manju told interrogators that she robbed two other elderly women in the same manner last month. After fixing a target, she would gain access by posing as a masseuse specialising in herbal treatment for knee pain and skin diseases, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of the detective department.        
	Sushmas death had prompted Manju to mend her ways but greed overcame her and she fell back on her old drug-and-rob ploy last month. She drugged 75-year-old Amala Roy of Gariahat, and robbed her on June 5. Within a fortnight, she visited 71-year-old Pushpa Roy in Tollygunge and tried the same trick but it didnt work. Manju then put Plan B into action. She visited Pushpas house one day and offered her prasad from Kalighat temple. This time, she bit the bait, a police officer said.        
	Investigators started hunting for Manju after realising that the modus operandi in all three crimes was the same.         
	We prepared an identikit, based on which we traced her to Sonarpur, the officer said.        
	The police found jewellery and other stolen articles in Manjus house.

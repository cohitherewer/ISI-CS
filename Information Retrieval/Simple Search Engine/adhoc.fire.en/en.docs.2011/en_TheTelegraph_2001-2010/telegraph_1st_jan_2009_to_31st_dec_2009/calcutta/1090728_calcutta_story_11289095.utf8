The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fight against fare and fume   Assaulted for standing   up to auto goons
                                                                                                               Fight against fare and fume     -  Assaulted for standing   up to auto goons
  - THEY PUNCHED, KICKED AND HIT ME WITH A ROD                                                            
	Pradip Basu, the Baguiati trader who was assaulted by a gang of auto goons on Sunday night, was targeted because he not only refused to pay more than the usual fare but also made sure other passengers didnt.        
	The 35-year-old braved blurred vision in his left eye, concussion, muscle and ligament sprain  all caused by the assault  to narrate to Metro how the horror story unfolded.              
	I am a resident of Ambagan, in Baguiati, and often commute by auto. The Ultadanga-Baguiati route is notorious for drivers demanding more than the normal fare of Rs 7 at night, and most passengers dont complain because they are either in a hurry or dont want to get into an argument.        
	On Sunday, around 8.15pm, me and a friend (Kushal Chakraborty) reached Ultadanga from the Khanna crossing and waited for an auto to take us home.        
	Several three-wheelers were parked at the stand but none of the drivers was willing to ferry passengers for the normal fare.        
	When I asked a driver whether he would go to Baguiati, he curtly told me: Baro taka dite hobe (You will have to pay Rs 12).        
	I moved on to the next driver, who repeated the demand. I remember telling Kushal at that very moment that come what may, I wouldnt pay a rupee more than the legal fare.         
	We were about to walk towards the Ultadanga bridge after arguing with yet another driver over the extra fare when a man arrived and asked him what the matter was.        
	Arre, niye ja na dosh taka kore (Take them for Rs 10 each), he advised.        
	The driver asked us to get in, at which I clearly said that we would pay only the regular fare. He then tried to seal the deal at Rs 8 per passenger, but I didnt reply. I dont know if he assumed that it meant I had agreed to pay Rs 16 for the trip. Three more passengers boarded the auto after us.        
	After crossing the bridge, I asked the driver again why autos were demanding almost double the fare for no reason. Raat hole ei rokom-i dite hoy (At night, this is the rate), he replied.        
	I continued arguing with him even as one of the passengers got off midway after paying the fare that the driver demanded of him.        
	On reaching Baguiati, I gave the driver a Rs 20 note and he returned Rs 4.        
	I protested. He argued that I had agreed to pay Rs 8 each at the time of boarding the auto. As he reluctantly returned Rs 6 to me, the two passengers at the back asked why they should pay more than the normal fare when me and my friend were being charged Rs 7 each.         
	More autos arrived, and the number of protesters mounted. I noticed that the auto drivers were glaring at me, though I had no inkling of what was to follow.        
	Around half-an-hour later, Kushal and I were walking down the lane leading to our para when three autos came racing towards us. Before we could react, 10-12 men alighted from the autos and started punching and kicking us. I shouted at Kushal to run and get help. He managed to free himself and scamper to safety but I couldnt. The assailants tried to bundle me into one of the autos but I wriggled out of their grasp. As I tried to run away, one of them hit me on the head with a rod and I fell.         
	I struggled back to my feet but my head was spinning. The only thing I remember after that is that two acquaintances came to my rescue and the gang fled.        
	My protest will not be in vain if more people stand up to these goons.

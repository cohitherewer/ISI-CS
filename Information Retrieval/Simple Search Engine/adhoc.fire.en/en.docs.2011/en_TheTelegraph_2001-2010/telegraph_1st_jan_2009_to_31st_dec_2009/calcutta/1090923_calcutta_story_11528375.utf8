The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Powerless on Puja-eve
                                                                                                               Powerless on Puja-eve
  - DEITY IN THE DARK          OUR BUREAU                          Idol-makers in Kumartuli were forced to apply the finishing touches by candlelight on Tuesday. Just when we thought our prayers for the rain to stop had been heard, our work was stalled by the power cuts, rued artisans. Picture by Pradip Sanyal                                        
	A falling branch (the likely, though unconfirmed, villain according to CESC sources) rendered large parts of Calcutta powerless on Tuesday, adding to the moody blues of price rise and pitter-patter on Puja-eve.        
	Minutes after a 132 KV wire at CESCs Chakmir substation in Mahestala snapped at 10.47am, the lights went out at Writers Buildings, the high court, Metro Railway, Raj Bhavan, SSKM and most of the city.                
	Both units at CESCs 500MW Budge Budge power station and the two units at the 135MW Southern generating station shut down and the CESC grid at Howrah substation was isolated.        
	The shutdown and isolation was a preventive measure to safeguard against tripping, that can cause large-scale damage to the system, said a CESC official. The sudden shortfall of 635MW, around 65 per cent of our total generation, was tough to make up.        
	Power to key establishments was restored at 11.30am, as CESC went into overdrive to import 600MW (maximum permissible limit) from the state electricity distribution company. Parts of north, central and south Calcutta, however, went without power till late evening.        
	Calcutta High Court officials described Tuesdays power cuts as unprecedented. All three buildings went without power for about 25 minutes. A lift full of passengers was held up between the first and second floors of the centenary building.        
	Metro Railway went without power for seven minutes. Trains were stranded at various stations and train schedules went haywire during the peak hour, said a senior official of Metro.        
	Long after power was restored, escalators at various stations remained out of service and lifts in the extended sections were stalled. Power cuts apart, the turnstiles at almost all stations malfunctioned in the morning and afternoon, forcing Metro officials to free the gates.        
	The power cuts hit last-minute Puja preparations on Chaturthi, from idol-making to lighting arrangements to pandal preparations.        
	First the rain and now the power failure, the divine powers are really testing us this time, said Sibshankar Basu at a gloomy Maddox Square.        
	Things were dark and depressing at the abode of the gods. It didnt rain today but power cuts slowed down the final detailing work. About half of the puja organisers are yet to take the idols away, and so these power cuts are making it difficult for us to finish work and despatch the idols, said Babu Pal of Kumartuli Mritshilpa Sanskriti Samity.        
	I wont be able to finish everything today because of the power cuts, rued Asim Dey, who is lighting up the College Square and Ekdalia Evergreen pandals. The artiste from Chandernagore is dreading the prospect of the organisers not managing to display all the lights. Money is not everything. As an artiste you want your work to reach the people, Dey said.        
	At the College Square puja, inaugurated on Tuesday evening, there was no power for five hours. We already have two generators and we will be getting another one, but even then we wont be able to have all the lights on, said Bikash Majumdar of the puja where the USP is illumination.        
	Getting additional generators, even at the risk of pushing up budgets, is the need of the hour. All our finishing touches for the pandal and mandap and light-testing are held up, said Aroop Biswas of Suruchi Sangha in New Alipore. It seems this Puja we will have to depend totally on generators.        
	Power back-up is what shop stops depended on for last-minute festive buys. There was no power till 4pm, the longest power cut we have suffered, said Bijay Lenka, the chief engineer at the South City mall.

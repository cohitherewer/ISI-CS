The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Freedom fetters on Presidency 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Freedom fetters on Presidency 
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees bid to upgrade Presidency College to a world-class unitary university could yet remain a distant dream with the old tools of political meddling finding their way into the draft bill for freedom.        
	The 36-page Presidency University Bill 2009, a copy of which is available with Metro, retains clauses that former CPM state secretary Anil Biswas had devised to retain control over academic institutions of the state.         
	The bill is nothing but a reproduction of the acts governing Calcutta University, Jadavpur University and Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu). The purpose of awarding freedom to Presidency will be lost as the institute cannot enjoy academic, administrative and financial freedom if the bill is passed in its existing form, said an education department official.         
	Drawn up by the state legal department in consultation with the higher education department, the bill is likely to come up for discussion in the Assembly on December 16.         
	Unless amendments are made to the draft bill, Presidency will become an ordinary university, the official said, referring specifically to Clause 16 of the draft bill.         
	At the heart of the politically motivated bill is the attempt to include registered graduates, who are primarily political appointees, in the Court, which will be one of the main decision-making bodies of the proposed university. The efforts of graduate representatives in pursuing political agenda in the decision-making process would be complemented by representatives of the non-teaching staff, trade union leaders and MLAs.        
	It is difficult to understand how trade union leaders or non-teaching staff members can have a say in academic decisions, said a Jadavpur University professor.         
	Criticising the existing process of involving graduate representatives, he said only distinguished past students should be invited to be part of the Court. But since the days of Biswas, the ruling CPM has been filling up CU, JU and Besu with its members by using the graduate representative route, said a former CU professor.         
	According to him, though all these academic institutes had separate acts to govern their affairs, Biswas got them amended to include party loyalists in the courts, or executive councils, of academic institutions.        
	JU is governed under the Jadavpur University Act, 1981, framed in 1955 and later amended under Biswass leadership. The former CPM state secretary played a role in the framing of the Besu Act 2004 and amendments made to the CU Act of 1979.         
	In the draft bill, the provisions related to appointment of vice chancellors are almost the same as in JU, Besu and CU, where the party has the final say in the selection of vice-chancellors. The VC shall be appointed by the chancellor on the unanimous recommendation of the Court, states the provision in Clause 7 of Chapter II of the bill.         
	It adds that in the absence of a unanimous decision, the VC would be appointed by the chancellor in consultation with the higher education minister from a panel of three persons elected by the Court.         
	According to a Presidency alumnus, the process  heavily skewed with political appointees  would invariably throw up favourites of the ruling party as the VC.         
	Mumbai University, currently in the process of recruiting a new VC, is following the standard process with Andre Beteille, emeritus professor of sociology at the University of Delhi and a former National Knowledge Commission member, and M.S. Ananth, the director of IIT Chennai, as the members of the search committee.

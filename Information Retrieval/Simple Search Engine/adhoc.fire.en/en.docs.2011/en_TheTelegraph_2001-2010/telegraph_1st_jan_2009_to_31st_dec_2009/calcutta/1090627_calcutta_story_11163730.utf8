The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | High flu threat within ward   Suspects beware of flu ward
                                                                                                               High flu threat within ward   Suspects beware of flu ward
  - Hospital flouts rules by keeping suspects with patient          A STAFF REPORTER                                                  
	Six is turning out to be a crowd in an ill-equipped, 20-bed quarantine ward where swine flu suspects are being forced to share toilets and stay in close proximity with a confirmed patient.        
	The Infectious Diseases Hospital in Beleghata stands accused of violating basic WHO guidelines by bundling swine flu suspects into a room where an NRI girl who tested positive has been moving about freely.        
	On Friday, a four-year-old girl and her parents joined the seven-year-old flu patient, Shruti Ghosh, her mother and a 48-year-old Bangkok resident in the rat and roach-infested ward.        
	A senior virologist at the National Institute of Communicable Diseases in Delhi said this was a recipe for disaster. Swine flu is not a debilitating disease but it is highly contagious. If a hospital does not follow guidelines, it would defeat the purpose of quarantining people.         
	Tapas Sen, the nodal officer for swine flu in Bengal, admitted that more isolation wards were required to cope with the rush of swine flu suspects. We are looking to open another ward. If necessary, we will create wards in other hospitals.        
	Aniruddha Kar, the director of health services, said the authorities were doing their best to make the swine flu suspects comfortable in the isolation ward. We are arranging to serve them special food. A water purifier has already been installed.        
	Sunita Das, 31, who was brought in on Friday along with husband Partha and daughter Suchismita, 4, after they arrived from Bangkok, said a doctor had reprimanded her when she complained about being put in the same ward as a flu patient.                                                  
	He told me that one cannot get the virus if the distance with the patient was more than a metre, said the resident of Assam, whose daughter is suffering from fever and cold.        
	The doctor may have been right in theory but an investigation by Metro revealed how everything about the isolation ward is contrary to swine flu guidelines.        
	WARNING: If a patient coughs or sneezes and he/she does not cover the mouths, droplets can spread about a metre (three feet). You could be infected if you are too close to that person.        
	IN THE WARD: Sunita Das and her daughter Suchismita have been allotted beds opposite Shruti and her mother. Barely two metres separate them. A curtain has been used as a partition between the male and female units. Sunitas husband Partha, who does not have symptoms and has been quarantined as a precaution, and flu suspect Prem Chand Yadav from Bangkok are in the male section.        
	WARNING: Droplets and the virus they carry are easily transferred to surfaces that a patient touches. The virus can live on a hard surface for up to 24 hours, and a soft surface for around 20 minutes.         
	IN THE WARD: The two women and the second child in the ward are sharing a toilet with Shruti, who has the virus. The seven-year-old could contaminate anything she touches.        
	WARNING: A mask reduces the risk of catching or spreading the virus.        
	IN THE WARD: Even doctors and nurses often dont wear masks. How can you continue wearing that mask in this heat? The authorities should have installed at least an airconditioner, complained one flu suspect.

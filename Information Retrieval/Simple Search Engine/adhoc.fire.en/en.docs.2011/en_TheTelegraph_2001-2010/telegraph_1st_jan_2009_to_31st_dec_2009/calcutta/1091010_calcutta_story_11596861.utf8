                                                                                                               Job racket accused denied bail
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	A high court vacation division bench on Friday rejected an anticipatory bail plea by Chandernagore-resident Sumit Goswami, who is apprehending arrest on the charge of duping thousands of students by promising IT jobs.        
	According to the public prosecutor, Sumit Goswami and five associates approached students by posing as executives of a Sector V firm and collected about Rs 15 crore.         
	The six had allegedly claimed to be executive officers of a company named Assoser Mail. But the police did not find any such firm in the database of companies in Sector V, said the public prosecutor.        
	Over the past six months, the cases of Salt Lake-based dud IT firms ANI Infogen Private Ltd and Assurgent Technology Solutions that had used the same technique to dupe students have come to light.         
	The division bench expressed concern about such incidents.        
	An investigator said Goswamis arrest was vital for busting the racket.

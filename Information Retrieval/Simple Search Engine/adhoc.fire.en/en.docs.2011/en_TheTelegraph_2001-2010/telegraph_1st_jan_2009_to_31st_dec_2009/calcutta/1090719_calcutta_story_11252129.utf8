                              Conservation conundrum: Indian Museum                            
	Will a mansard roof be the crowning glory of the Indian Museum as part of its bicentenary celebrations in 2014? Nobody, neither the trustee board nor the Central Public Works Department (CPWD), which is responsible for undertaking a feasibility test and a study of the museum fabric, has a clear answer.        
	A vision and development committee has been appointed to take charge of the work. Sadly, the committee is itself divided over two points in the plan submitted by DBA Partners, shortlisted from among a group of architects  the mansard roof and a canopy over the courtyard to turn it into an exhibition area. And the CPWD is not sure of its role.        
	DBA Partners has submitted a concept plan at an estimated expenditure of approximately Rs 92 crore. The plans are for the restoration, upgrade and renovation of the museum, as reported in Metro on Sunday.        
	According to the DBA Partnerss proposal, a mansard roof will be constructed keeping in mind Walter Granvilles original plan for the museum.         
	The museum will be divided into a display area, forum space for seminars and for programmes and material that will be made available digitally to visitors. The quadrangle at the centre will be converted into a covered archaeological space.        
	The ground floor will be devoted to art, architecture, history and anthropology.        
	On the first floor will be the science and natural history galleries. The second floor will house the donor galleries. Another floor will be added to create forum space and the basement will be used for storage and to set up a laboratory.        
	There are plans for improved lighting so that radiation does not harm the exhibits and visibility is enhanced. Air quality and fire safety measures will also be improved, and a hi-tech surveillance system will be installed. A bookshop, library, and a cafeteria will be introduced and a parking lot created for 200 cars. The tank will be landscaped.        
	Although the CPWD will be involved in the project, it is not clear whether it has the requisite skills for this kind of job. Museum director K.K. Basa says: The trustees have decided that the CPWD will be engaged to carry out a comprehensive structural and constructional feasibility test of the proposed concept  feasibility from the angle of development control and applicable municipal by-laws, and feasibility of the execution of concept from the heritage point of view.         
	It is, however, unclear if the CPWD can double as conservation architect. Additions and alterations in the context of historical buildings have to be handled very sensitively, and I hope that the CPWD will contract the necessary expertise if they do not possess them in-house, wrote A.G.K. Menon, the convener of the Delhi chapter of INTACH, in an email.         
	The CPWD, on its part, insisted that it is only a constructional agency and that private consultants have to be appointed to carry out all modifications in the plan. We have been informed by the museum authorities of their decision to involve the CPWD in the renovation work and told them to firm up the process of finalising the private agency of architects, who will work as consultants on the project, and also to sign the MOU with the CPWD, said CPWD chief engineer C.S. Prasad. He stressed that the architects will have to do all the feasibility checks and come up with a design conforming to all existing rules to be executed by the CPWD.        
	Culture secretary Jawhar Sircar said over the telephone that it was too early to worry about execution. Everything is in a nascent stage. No one has been given any powers of execution. The CPWD will test the soil and structure and the strength of the load-bearing walls, because it is a very old building. The CPWD has the engineering skills for that. Everything else about the design, including the mansard roof, will depend on that.

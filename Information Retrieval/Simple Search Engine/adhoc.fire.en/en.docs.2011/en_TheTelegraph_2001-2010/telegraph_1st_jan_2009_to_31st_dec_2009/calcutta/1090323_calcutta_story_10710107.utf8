                      Artists protest against violence                    Creative minds have always been spontaneous in their response to any form of violence, whether it is war, anarchy, revolution or any other form of political turbulence. Their sense of social responsibility and wisdom, demonstrated through their works of art, has paved the way to bring about significant social changes. At this time of global insecurity, fear and disharmony, with the threat of terror looming large over our lives everyday, the theme, Art Against Terrorism, has brought together artists and art galleries in an expression of solidarity with the people and the country as a whole. An initiative by the Art Activists of Calcutta, it comprises a series of art exhibitions to be held in the city, with a mission to raise a voice in protest against the mindless acts of terror and violence happening in the world today. Featuring works by 160 leading artists and upcoming talents at nine galleries across the city, the shows provide them a platform to express and share their ideas, opinions, suggestions and remonstrations through the powerful visual language of art and aesthetics. The first among them, to be inaugurated this evening at 6, is being hosted by Aakriti Art Gallery. Participants: Amitava Dhar, Habibur Rehman, Jogen Chowdhury, Kartick Chandra Pyne, Partha Pratim Deb, Sekhar Roy (a painting by him appears here), Akhil Chandra Das, Ashoke Mallick, Rabin Mondal, Samindranath Majumdar, Sunil De, Tapas Konar, Sourav Jana, Tapas Biswas, Rajesh Deb, Priyanka Lahiri and Apurba Nandi.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Three of the five Calcuttans who died in a boat mishap in Kerala two days ago were cremated on Wednesday.        
	The three victims are Anu Bhandari, Nirmal Kanti Das and his wife Meena.        
	Bhandaris body was flown in late on Thursday. Her elder son Vikram brought the body to Calcutta via Chennai. The last rites were performed at the Keoratala crematorium at 11.30am, said a relative.        
	Bhandaris son-in-law Vishal Kochar, who was on the same vessel, had a lucky escape. My wife, our two children, my brothers child and I were sitting on the right side of the upper deck. My mother-in-law was sitting on the left, Kochar recalled.        
	In Kerala, some people had alleged that all tourists had gathered on one side of the vessel, causing it to topple. But that is not true. We were all in our seats, he added.        
	The bodies of the Das couple have been cremated in Mumbai where their two daughters live with their families. The bodies arrived in Mumbai at 1.20pm, said Alok Chowdhury, a son-in-law of the Duttas.        
	The mortal remains of the other two victims from the city  Dipak Kumar Dutta and wife Kalpana  were flown in around 9.30am on Friday and have been kept at Peace Haven in central Calcutta.         
	The bodies will be cremated after the couples only son Rupak, who lives in the US, arrives. He is expected by 11.30pm on Saturday, said Kalpanas brother Bikash Bose, who had rushed to Kerala on hearing about the tragedy.        
	The Kerala government had arranged a special flight to transport the bodies. We started from Kerala at 1.30am on Friday and reached Delhi around 4.30am. There were 11 victims from Delhi. Another flight left Delhi for Calcutta at 6.30am, added Bose.

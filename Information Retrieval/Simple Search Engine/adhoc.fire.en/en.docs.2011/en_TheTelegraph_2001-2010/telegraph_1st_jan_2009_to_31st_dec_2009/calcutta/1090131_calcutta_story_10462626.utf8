                The high court on Friday could not hear a case related to the phasing out of two-stroke autorickshaws in the city because Justice P.C. Ghosh of the green bench was out on an assignment. The government was supposed to submit an affidavit on the progress of the phase-out on Friday since the green bench usually sits on that day. Earlier, the division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice P.C. Ghosh had directed the government to file the progress report after 15 days but the court was closed on that day. The case will now come up for hearing on February 6.    An inquiry was ordered against Atanu Mukherjee, the superintendent of a civic chest clinic, on the charge of financial misconduct. Mayoral council member (health) Subodh Dey said auditors had pointed out irregularities in the purchase of medicines during his tenure. The authorities have also accused him of not returning unutilised state funds given to the civic body for buying medicines.    Six girls and four men were arrested in a beauty parlour in Jadavpur on Friday for allegedly running a sleaze racket. A search is on for the owner of the parlour.    A disability awareness programme will be organised by Trinayani in the US stall at the Book Fair from February 5 to 7. The sessions, to be held from 4.30pm to 5pm, will be conducted by counsellor Ritika Sahani. Short films on disability will also be screened on the occasion. Teachers and students can write to sahniritikayahoo.com for details.    Shiuli Das, 21, was found hanging in her Thakurpukur home on Friday. Police said she had married Sanjib two years back and had been tortured for dowry since. Sanjib and his mother were arrested.    Mamata Banerjee on Friday spoke at a rally organised by the Nandaram Market Banchao Committee on Friday in front of the market. Traffic on Brabourne Road came to a crawl during the rally.

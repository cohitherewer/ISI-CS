The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bindra to Bagan, with tips for mind amp; muscle
                                                                                                               Bindra to Bagan, with tips for mind amp; muscle
          RITH BASU                          Amit Bhattacharya with Abhinav Bindra, who is carrying the gun that won him the Olympic gold                                  
	After hitting the bulls eye with Abhinav Bindra, the mind behind the man with the golden gun is coming to the Maidan this summer to score a goal with Mohun Bagan.        
	Ranaghat boy Amit Bhattacharya, who has been the mental conditioning coach of Indias lone individual Olympic gold medallist for 13 years, is returning to his roots to help players of the Mohun Bagan SAIL Football Academy in Durgapur realise their potential the way his most famous ward did.        
	The training will start in July with a six-day camp. The next session has been planned for September.        
	I was thrilled on being invited by Mohun Bagan. The junior teams manager, Tapan Bose, had contacted me in Chandigarh last year to conduct a few sessions with his players and the results were good. They were beaten in the final but the matches they won were by huge margins, Bhattacharya, 41, told Metro on Friday.        
	Academy in-charge Tapan Roy said the junior footballers had told him after returning from the tournament in Chandigarh that the highlight of their trip was interacting with Bhattacharya. He taught them breathing patterns and small things that make a big difference to a teams performance. The team management, including our coach Roy Maicol Barreto, said they wanted more sessions with him. The fact that Bindra speaks so highly of him helped us take the decision.        
	Rival club East Bengal is also aiming to use Bhattacharyas expertise. He is scheduled to have a session with Subhash Bhowmicks red-and-gold brigade on Saturday.         
	A club official said that Bhattacharya, who has a Ph.D in sports psychology from Milan, had been requested to focus on goalkeeper Subrata Pal and teach him to be calm.         
	Its all in the mind. The mind even has the power to heal injuries or cure ailments, Bhattacharya said.        
	The mental conditioning coach uses yoga and meditation along with modern techniques to bring the best out of those he trains.         
	I use techniques like the psydynamic theory, which is the study of the impact of the physical and emotional system on human movements, as well as biokinetic programming and alternative therapies like meditative asanas.        
	His wards include Asavari Tayal, a Class IX student who is good in shooting as well as academics, and eight-year-old horse rider Zorawar Singh, who holds a national equestrian record but was once afraid of making his horse clear a hurdle.        
	Asavari has already won two junior national shooting events, Bhattacharya said.        
	His association with Bindra started when the shooter was 13.         
	Mohun Bagan felicitated Bhattacharya and Bindra, who was in town this week, at a city hotel on Thursday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | City police plan for the outskirts 
                                                                                                               City police plan for the outskirts 
          KINSUK BASU                               
	Calcutta police has drawn up a traffic management plan for the fringes which are set to be brought under its jurisdiction.        
	The blueprint for Great Calcutta Metropolitan Police envisages city police taking over the control of police stations and setting up traffic guards in areas like New Town, Salt Lake and Garia.        
	The idea is to bring about a change in the quality of civic and traffic policing on the outskirts. We have submitted our proposal to the government. Once it is accepted, the fringes will be policed more intensively than before, said additional commissioner Banibrata Basu.        
	According to the plan, the jurisdiction of Calcutta police will extend to Behala and Garia in the south and New Town and the airport in the north.        
	The road space under the control of city traffic police will increase from 104sq km to 175sq km.         
	Six more traffic guards, with 250 constables and 25 sergeants each, have been proposed to prevent traffic congestion on the fringes, often blamed on shortage of manpower.        
	Four of the traffic guards will be in the south and other two in the north. Traffic guards have been planned at Behala, Jadavpur, Kasba and Metiabruz in the south. At the other end of the town, Salt Lake and Airport guards are expected to handle traffic in Salt Lake, Lake Town, Baguiati, New Town and a part of the airport.        
	Salt Lake will have a dedicated traffic guard. The Behala Traffic Guard will cover Behala and Regent Park. Two deputy commissioners will oversee traffic management in the added areas. Two more traffic control rooms will be set up, said a senior officer involved with the project.        
	Key roads and intersections to come under Calcutta police include Raja Subodh Chandra Mullick Road, Prince Anwar Shah Road and Behala Chowrasta. Kasba and Tiljala stand to benefit from increased police presence.        
	Lalbazar estimates a bill of around Rs 300 crore to extend its area of control.        
	Sources in the state home department indicated that a nod to the project was only a matter of time. Offering better policing on the fringes is a priority of the government, said a senior officer of the state home department.

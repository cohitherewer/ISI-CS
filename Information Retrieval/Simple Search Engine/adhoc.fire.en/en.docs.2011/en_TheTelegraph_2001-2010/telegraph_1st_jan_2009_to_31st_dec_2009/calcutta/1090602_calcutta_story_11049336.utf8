The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Warfare in skies to woo fliers
                                                                                                               Warfare in skies to woo fliers

	The battle this season is as much between Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Mamata Banerjee, as it is between airlines aiming for the heart (and purse) of the city.        
	Lower leisure travel in the time of downturn has triggered price slash and sops to lure the wary flier.        
	This season, travel is around 15 per cent lower than what it was last year, with few takers for regular fares. So airlines have been forced to come out with tempting fares, said Anil Punjabi, the chairman (east) of the Travel Agents Federation of India.        
	Emirates, Singapore Airlines, Thai Airways, Air India, Jet Airways have all rolled out low fares and innovations.         
	The short-term promotions are all aimed at netting leisure travellers  the segment which has become most vulnerable in the downturn, pointed out a senior official of a private airline in the city.        
	People are now thinking twice before taking a flight for leisure trips. These special promotions will make them travel, he hoped.        
	And there seems to be something for everyone  from the CEO to the teenager.        
	The price cuts have come at the right time, just when the mood is shifting from crisis to confidence, said industrialist Sanjay Budhia.        
	The election of a stable government, the upswing in the markets and the slash in ticket prices will combine to boost air travel, added the president of the Indian Chamber of Commerce.        
	According to aviation industry sources, apart from offering special fares for the business class traveller, the airlines have also kept the economy class fares lower than in previous years.        
	Usually, the economy class fares go up by 10 to 15 percent in peak tourist season compared to the non-peak season. But this time there has been no hike fearing a drop in passenger count, admitted the official of an airline.        
	If Jet Airways came up with a limited business class return fare offer of Rs 60,000 (plus taxes) for Calcutta-London , Thai Airways has a monsoon special fare of Rs 11,585 (plus taxes) to Kuala Lumpur, Singapore and Penang.        
	In the domestic sector Air India is offering summer special one-way fares to most destinations from Calcutta, and rock-bottom return fares to Singapore, Bangkok and Dhaka on Air India Express.        
	Emirates has opted for special features over fare slash. Its Kids Go Free scheme allows one child below 16 years to fly free or a maximum of two children to stay, eat and play in Dubai free when travelling with two paying adults.         
	In these tough economic times it is important to provide families with a holiday option that allows them to escape and relax without the financial strain an international holiday can bring, said Nabil Sultan of Emirates.        
	The sops seem to be working already, at least for the Basus of Ballygunge Circular Road. We were feeling guilty about planning a short holiday to a foreign destination, but with the revised fares we can now go ahead with a smile, said Sanjay and Smita, in their mid-30s.        
	An exception to the fare slash rule till now is Lufthansa. Our flights are going full and so there are no special fares, an airline official put it bluntly.

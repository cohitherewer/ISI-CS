                                                                                                               Revelry within safety ring

	The evening may have started under a veil of security, but it lifted fast to reveal the face of a Calcutta that loves to party.        
	Car checks, metal detectors, bag searches and even body frisking were patiently endured at almost every New Years Eve party venue in town. Once inside, the crowd left every trace of gloom behind to bid 2008 goodbye.        
	Many hopped from party to party. A sea of revellers held up traffic in the Park Street- Shakespeare Sarani-Jawaharlal Nehru Road belt from around 11pm.        
	At CC amp;FC, where the footfall rose from about 2,200 last year to about 3,000, eight police personnel were posted. The club had also bolstered its private security team from eight guards to 40. The front and back gates had door-frame metal detectors and bags were checked with hand-held detectors. Random frisking, too, was conducted.        
	There were metal detectors and women police officers at CC amp;FC this year, which was good, said Reshmi Bose, 42. I did not mind the security checks because it was all well-planned and smooth. It would help if there was such security every year.        
	At Tollygunge Club, thorough checks were conducted at three points. One was at the main gate. Then there was one at an intermediate point. Guests identified themselves at the venue entry. We were assisted by the police, said K.B. Menon of Tolly Club. Cars were checked, too.        
	The BTP bash at Swabhumi had a thick security cover. There were over 45 uniformed cops and plainclothesmen at the venue, more than 100 private security guards and bouncers. A closed-circuit camera was positioned near the main entrance to spot trespassers and police cars did the rounds to monitor the surrounding area. The VIP zone had an additional layer of security.        
	The security was tight. If there is a problem, people will blame the organisers. So I think it is fair, said a young woman partying at BTP.        
	At Spring Club, in the high-security Bypass belt, security was strict but not severe. All guests had to walk through a metal detector. Men were frisked and ladies purses were not spared.        
	We had metal detectors and CCTVs at the entry point and in the hall. We ensured that the 1,000-plus visitors were checked quickly, said Sanjeev Ghosh, the general manager of Spring Club.        
	The Nokia XpressMusic party at Nalban had strict entry rules. There were long queues as visitors and their bags were frisked. Another security ring was thrown around the VIP section.        
	Dalhousie Institute had posted about 12 private security guards along with two police personnel at the gates. A team from the local police station inspected the premises before the party.        
	At Shisha, the Camac Street nightclub, a crowd of 1,500 had to pass through a door-frame metal detector and scan by security guards. Where necessary, a thorough search was conducted, said Sovan Mukherjee, the manager of Shisha. Policemen from Shakespeare Sarani police station, too, were posted at the nightclub.

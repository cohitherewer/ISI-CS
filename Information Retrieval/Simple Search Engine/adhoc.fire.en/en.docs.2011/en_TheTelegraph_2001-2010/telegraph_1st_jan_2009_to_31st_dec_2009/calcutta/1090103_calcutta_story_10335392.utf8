          A STAFF REPORTER                          An inmates relative at one of the gates of Howrah jail. (Gopal Senapati)                                  
	Police have lodged complaints against 18 inmates of Howrah jail in connection with the riot on the premises on Thursday.        
	The inmates, including Rahul Mullick and Suraj Mullick who sparked the unrest as they were about to be transferred to Alipore Central jail, have been charged with arson, rioting and heckling government employees.        
	Additional superintendent (town) Sukesh Jain said they would be produced in the chief judicial magistrates court on Saturday.        
	The 50-odd inmates who burnt down the superintendents office on Thursday had also looted about Rs 90,000 from the room.        
	Assistant district magistrate (general) Chayan Chandan Guha said: So far, Rs 13,000 has been recovered from the inmates. A search is on for the rest of the money.        
	Some undertrials could not be produced in court as documents pertaining to their cases were destroyed in the fire, said a jail official.        
	On Friday, the inmates refused lunch and threw away dishes and glasses. They shouted slogans demanding that they be allowed to meet relatives at least thrice a week and have lunch with them.        
	Relatives of undertrials and convicts demonstrated near a gate of the jail after they were denied entry. Jail authorities said the relatives were not allowed inside for security reasons.         
	Inspector-general (prison) B.D. Sharma visited the jail and talked to officials and inmates. He said: Yesterdays incident is rare in the state. We are investigating whether there was any negligence on the part of the jail authorities.        
	Sharma added: I have spoken to inmates. Many told me that they were not involved in the violence.        
	The inspector-general ruled out the possibility of allowing inmates to meet relatives thrice a week. The jail would be run strictly according to the jail manual.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Foreigner fetish
                                                                                                               Foreigner fetish
                                          
	Location: A crowded Dum Dum-bound Metro; Time: Afternoon.         
	Which countries you are froms? a middle-aged man asks a group of foreigners.         
	Location: A Tollygunge-bound Metro; Time: Mid-morning. A man vacates his seat for a foreigner and exclaims: Sit, sit you guest our country.         
	The fixation with foreigners (sada chamra our grandparents would have said) persists even as the world becomes a global village. Is it curiosity, awe or courtesy? Or is it greediness (hyanglamo)? Another Bengali word for it is aadekhelapona (adekhela meaning the vulgar eager).         
	Whatever it is, its on full display in the Metro.         
	The moment a foreigner boards the Metro, a silence descends with all eyes sizing him/her up. Ogling is perhaps the most common manifestation. People take in every minute detail of a foreigners appearance and hang on to every word, says Bhaskar Bhattacharya, a commuter.         
	Chatting up is common and can get a little out of hand at times. There was once this gay man in the Metro hitting on a blonde guy. The guy kept waving his hands trying to ward him off. The Indian probably thought it would be easier to pick up a foreigner, says Diya Sharma, another commuter.         
	A conversation with a foreigner (if you call asking for direction a conversation) is something to be flaunted. I have heard people narrating tales about how a foreigner asked them for a particular address. They seem almost flattered, says Devangi Banerjee at the Park Street Metro station.         
	But its not with every foreigner that we do this. The well-heeled receive the best treatment. And whites. Blacks are looked down upon. Barack Obama is different.

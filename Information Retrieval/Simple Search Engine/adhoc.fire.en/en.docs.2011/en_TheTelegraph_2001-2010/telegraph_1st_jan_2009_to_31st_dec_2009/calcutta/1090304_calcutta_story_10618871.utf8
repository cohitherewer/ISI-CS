          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta University will have to reschedule several undergraduate examinations as they clash with the election dates announced on Monday.        
	An official said the university would have to change the dates of some BA, BSc and BCom Part III (honours) exams under the 1+1+1 system and Part II (honours) tests under the 2+1 system, which are scheduled to start on April 20. The general course examinations will begin from May 5.        
	The general elections will be held in three phases in the state  on April 30, May 7 and May 13.        
	The Part II environmental studies exam was scheduled for April 30 and a number of BA, BSc and BCom (general) tests were to be held on May 7 and May 13.        
	We will have to reschedule the exams that fall on the three election days. If necessary, the dates of all tests between April 30 and May 13 will be changed as several colleges will be taken over by the authorities for the entire duration of the polls, said an official of the universitys examination department.        
	A final decision on changing the dates will be taken following talks with the state government, said Debashis Biswas, the deputy controller of examinations.        
	The university on Tuesday contacted the states election and home departments to get a list of colleges to be used for the elections.        
	Students  around a lakh will sit for the Part II and Part III exams  fear the rescheduling would upset their academic plans.         
	I want to do an MSc in applied chemistry from Benaras Hindu University, where the session starts early. I will lose that chance if the B.Sc Part III results are declared late because of the deferment of the exams, said a student.        
	The other two universities in the city  Jadavpur and Rabindra Bharati  said the three-phase Lok Sabha elections would not affect their exam schedules.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Monday shows the week: weatherman
                                                                                                               Monday shows the week: weatherman
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	A wet Monday provided a hint, or foreboding, of how the weather gods will behave through the rest of the festive week, the Met office said.        
	The city received 60.6mm of rain in 24 hours till 5.30pm on Monday, leaving vast stretches waterlogged and underlining fears of a wet Puja.        
	Local thunderclouds brought the rain. Such showers are likely to continue through the Puja, said a senior official at the Regional Meteorological Centre, Alipore.        
	The only silver lining, the official added, was the absence of any major system  such as low pressure, depression or cyclonic circulation  that could lead to heavy rain.        
	But the hope of the Puja being wet but not washed-out came with a rider. Just because there is no system today doesnt mean there cant be one in a couple of days, the official said.        
	The weatherman said Tuesday, Chaturthi on the Puja calendar, would be partly cloudy with the possibility of a few spells of rain and thundershower. Puja organisers like Manicktala Chaltabagan, which has a gala opening lined up on Tuesday, are taking cover and praying for relief.        
	Civic data revealed that Mominpur, Kidderpore, Beleghata, Tangra, Sealdah, Narkeldanga, Paikpara and Belgachhia received the maximum rainfall on Monday  around 70 mm. Parts of CR Avenue, Amherst Street, AJC Bose Road, MG Road, Sukeas Street, Muktarambabu Street, Thanthania, Behala, Kasba and Salt Lake Sector V were waterlogged till the evening. Kumartuli, too, was hit hard.        
	Amit Kumar Roy, the chief civic engineer in charge of drainage and sewerage, said the water receded slowly because of high tide in the Hooghly. The lock gates of the drainage channels leading to the river had to be kept shut from 12.30pm to 4pm because of high tide. All of our pumping stations operated to their capacity, said Roy.        
	Metro, however, spotted a pump near Mohammed Ali Park lying idle with no one around to operate it. Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya denied the allegation. Our men worked very hard. All employees on emergency duty had turned up though offices were closed on Id.        
	While the city was being pounded by the rain, residents felt mild tremors of a quake that originated in Bhutan. The first tremor lasted 40 seconds at 2.24pm, followed by another for seven seconds at 2.42pm. No damage was reported, said the Alipore Met office.

										                          Students watch a robot perform in the event Terminator at the Besu tech fest, Instruo.   Picture by Gopal Senapati              
	In Latin, the word instruo means creation, and the name for the Bengal Engineering and Science Universitys (Besu) tech fest was justified, with the best creative brains at work in the various events.         
	Students got together to shake off the tarnished image of the institution that has seen repeated instances of violence, and put on their innovation hats. The campus was abuzz with activity of a different kind on April 11 and 12, with more than 20 private engineering colleges, including Techno India and Institute of Engineering and Management (IEM) participating.         
	The fest began with a lecture by newly-appointed vice-chancellor, Ajay Kumar Ray, who congratulated students for organising the fest at barely a months notice.         
	Though we have had tech fests at Besu earlier, this is the first time it is happening on such a large scale, said Gaurav Kunar, a third-year student of electronic engineering and telecommunications, who was on the organising committee.        
	A series of seminars on nanotechnology and popular science, and on energy and environment were organised at the alumni auditorium on both days. While Kamaniyo Chatterjee of Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, spoke on nanotechnology as an inter-disciplinary subject,        
	Joyashree Roy, a professor of economics at Jadavpur University, spoke on ways of changing lifestyle to reduce energy consumption.         
	The real fun, however, was outside the air-conditioned halls. The open-air auditorium, Netaji Bhaban, was abuzz with events involving programmed robots built by the participants.        
	Robot cars outmanoeuvred, damaged and raced each other in Terminator. Robots, played soccer on a board in Robo Soccer and walked without deviating on a white line in Automaton. JIS College of Engineering, Kalyani won the first prize in Automaton. In Ad Blitz, debates and a quiz were organised on management concepts. Jadavpur University took the first position for the quiz, followed by Calcutta University and Presidency College.         
	Among the participants was Omkar Singh Gujral, a Class VII student from La Martiniere School for Boys. I enjoy building cars and robots. I wanted to to check out the robots here, he said.         
	The hosts took away most of the prizes, though some were spared for others. The first prize for Programista, where participants had to write programmes to illustrate a concept, went to IEM.         
	Korak Sengupta of Academy of Technology, Adisaptagram, enjoyed participating in Robo Soccer. Unlike other tech fests, we were allowed several trials for our robots. It was well-managed, he said.

	The Diary  
	A moonlit night        
	As twilight gives way to darkness 
  And evening draws to night, 
  Nature gradually wraps herself 
  In transparent silken light. 
  Creation reaches ecstatic heights, 
  When a full moon illuminates a dark midnight. 
  Like a candle glowing in the dark, 
  She holds her lamp to wayward life. 
  As if a passing veil had shaken a bud, 
  Fantasies and feelings find their words! 
  Unspoken words are heard 
  When moonlight bathes the earth. 
  As the glistening rays on the sleeping world are sprinkled, 
  Heaven comes down and the whole world twinkles! 
  When the earths existence was bereft of moon, 
  Perhaps paradise was still unknown. 
  For the radiant glory of a moonlit night 
  Has revealed Beautys delight. 
  Years have come, and years have gone; 
  A moonlit night still needs expression. 
  Moment by moment , as night grows old,
  Mesmerising hours show dreams untold!

	Indian Statistical Institutes (ISI) annual inter-college drama fest, Protichhobi, was held from April 25 to 27. Visva-Bharati, Rabindra Bharati University (RBU) and IIT Kharagpur participated in the second installment of the fest, with three teams from ISI.

	On the final day, The comedy Atmohotyaar Upokaarita by the ladies hostel and the M.Tech hostel of ISI was followed by the concluding performance of the festival, a Kafkaesque satire, The Vitriol, by the boys hostel Drama Club.

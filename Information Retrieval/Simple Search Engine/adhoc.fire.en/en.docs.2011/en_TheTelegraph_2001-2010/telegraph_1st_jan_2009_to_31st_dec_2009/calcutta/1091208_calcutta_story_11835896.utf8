	NGO Turning Point will tie up with New York-based organisation, Fountain House to make people with mental disabilities, financially independent.                   UNITED COLOURS OF INDIA Children dressed up to play their role in Bohurupee, a fancy dress competition at Ullas, the annual inter-school festival organised by South Point School, at Madhusudan Mancha on Monday. The fest, inaugurated by actor Sabyasachi Chakraborty, had 450 students, aged six to 12 years, representing 17 schools. Picture by Aranya Sen        
	Known as the clubhouse model in the US, it helps patients by providing them with training, helping them with their education and liaising with corporate houses to provide them with suitable jobs.         
	In New York, we help patients apply for higher studies, raise scholarships and even provide space and tutors for the patients, said Alan Doyle, of Fountain House.        
	Since we do similar work, we decided to collaborate. We might send some of the work our patients have done to the US through their network channels, said Ishita Sanyal, of Turning Point.         
	Explaining the need for finding jobs for the mentally ill, Sanyal said: We have calculated that a family spends up to Rs 1 lakh a month on a patient. This takes a toll on the family. Utilising the potential of such people would not only help the families, but also create confidence in the patient.        
	Before sending them for jobs, we check two things: whether they can handle money and if they can travel long distances alone to their assigned jobs, said Doyle.

	Kamal Nandy, 27, suffers from schizophrenia. He often faces ill-treatment when he is out on his own. People push me out of the queue when I am in line for an auto. When I ask for something in a shop, I am ignored sometimes, he says.         
	Nandy was one of many people whose plight was highlighted at a seminar organised by the NGO Turning Point on the employability and empowerment of people suffering from mental illness, held at Deshapriya Park on November 12.         
	While lawyer Sutapa Chakraborty spoke on the human rights aspect, Alan Doyle, the CEO of Fountainhouse, an American company that works with mentally ill people, spoke about the clubhouse model, a rehabilitation programme.        
	Said Ishita Sanyal, the director of Turning Point: Not only is it necessary to change the way people look down upon mentally ill people, it is also important for them to develop self-confidence so that society can give them the respect they deserve. This will be possible only when they are economically empowered.         
	Suggesting areas where sufferers could find jobs, Chakraborty said: Areas that require predictable, repetitive work, like bakeries and handicrafts, would find use for such people. Agreed Doyle: The handicrafts may even be sold in the US, where they have a thriving market.         
	Psychiatrist Dr Abir Mukherjee felt that rehabilitation was as important as medicines for treating mental disease. This can happen through centres where patients will be given vocational training according to their aptitude. This will help them to be integrated into mainstream society by providing them employment options, he said.         
	The seminar also saw patients, along with their families sharing experiences of dealing with their illnesses. Said Prakash Mathur, father of 26-year-old Sanjay, who suffers from depression: Training in basic computer skills helped my son get a job. He has been working for four years now and currently works in the finance department of a private firm. It is more than we had ever hoped for him.         
	The NGO also organises awareness visits by the mentally ill to colleges. As part of this programme, a writing competition on the subject of employability of mentally ill people, with prizes from the American Center Library is also on the cards.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Delay in transplant permission
                                                                                                               Delay in transplant permission
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A private hospital has accused the health department of sitting on its application for permission to carry out heart transplants when more than 50 people are awaiting the procedure in the state.         
	No hospital in Bengal is authorised to carry out heart transplant.        
	Despite having the infrastructure for heart transplants and despite repeatedly approaching various wings of the health department, we have not received any response, said Kunal Sarkar, the head of cardiac surgery at Rabindranath Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences, a super-speciality hospital on the EM Bypass.        
	All major state capitals have institutes conducting heart transplants, except Calcutta, he added.        
	On Wednesday, the hospital sent two letters to the director of medical education seeking approval for heart transplant. S.N. Banerjee, the director of medical education, said: For getting authorisation, the hospital must apply to the department concerned. My department approves only the method of transplant.        
	After a heart transplant, 60 per cent patients live at least 10 years and 90 per cent patients at least two years, said doctors. A heart transplant costs Rs 7 to 9 lakh.         
	According to Sarkar, the governments delay in granting permission to the hospital to carry out heart transplants was holding up the treatment of patients with complete heart failure, when transplant is the only hope. A patient at the hospital, recently had to fly to Bangalore for heart transplant.        
	Hospital officials claimed the institute had state-of-the-art immunology laboratory as well as organ and tissue typing and advanced haematology units.

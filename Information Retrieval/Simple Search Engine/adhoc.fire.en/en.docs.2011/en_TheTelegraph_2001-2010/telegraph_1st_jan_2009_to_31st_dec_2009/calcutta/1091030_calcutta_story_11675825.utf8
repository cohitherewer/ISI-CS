	Security will be stepped up at Bhawani Bhavan, the CID headquarters in Alipore, where Chhatradhar Mahato is being interrogated for his alleged links with the Maoists.        
	Members of the striking force of the city police, armed with Insas weapons, will be deployed around Bhawani Bhavan from Friday. Besides, the Heavy Radio Flying Squad and plainclothesmen will be on duty.        
	There will also be a special force  comprising an inspector, three sub-inspectors and two assistant sub-inspectors  to run a final check on visitors.        
	Security is being beefed up following reports of secret meetings to mobilise support for the Maoists, said an officer. Inside the building, guards have been posted on all floors and movements are being scanned by the Special Branch.

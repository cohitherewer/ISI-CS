The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Grand guard rails gone one night, back the next 
                                                                                                               Grand guard rails gone one night, back the next 
  - Barricades removed for 24 hours after argument between judge and hotel guards on scan jurisdiction          OUR BUREAU                          The guard rails outside The Oberoi Grand were missing in action on Tuesday. (Amit Datta)                                        
	The guard rails on Chowringhee set up outside The Oberoi Grand after the Mumbai terror strikes on November 26 did the disappearing act from Monday night till Tuesday night, allegedly after an argument between a high court judge and the private security guards at the hotel gates.        
	The judges red light-flashing car was apparently stopped on Sunday and checked by the guards just outside The Oberoi Grand as it was about to enter the hotel. The judge protested, claiming that private security guards could not scan a car on a thoroughfare  in this case the stretch of Chowringhee leading to the hotel driveway. Such scanning is par for the course at all high-security addresses, from hotels to consulates, post-26/11.        
	The judge later alleged that the Tata Safari Dicor he was driving was thoroughly frisked near the guard rails in front of the hotel despite his protestations. His personal security officer showed the guards the judges identity card and told them not to check the car but they insisted on doing what they said was their duty, said a source.        
	The judge is learnt to have registered a complaint with the hotel authorities and the police about private security guards overstepping their line by checking his car on a thoroughfare, which was the polices jurisdiction. On Monday night, a team of about 50 policemen from New Market police station arrived at the hotel door and removed all the guard rails on Chowringhee that formed a lane for vehicles entering the hotel. Throughout Tuesday, the private security guards outside The Oberoi Grand checked vehicles on their way in on a Chowringhee minus the rails.        
	Asked about the sudden removal of the barricades that had been set up as an essential security measure by the police and the hotel authorities, a senior police officer at Lalbazar said: The incident in the barricaded area in front of the hotel involved a high court judge. So, as an immediate measure, we removed the guard rails.        
	On Tuesday evening, city police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti blamed it all on a miscommunication and said that the guard rails would soon be back where they belong. There was a miscommunication which led to the removal of the guard railings in front of The Oberoi Grand, Chakrabarti told Metro. But they will soon be back.        
	Sure enough, around 10pm on Tuesday, the 10-odd guard rails leading to the portico of the star hotel were back in place after a 24-hour absence caused by alleged misdemeanour and miscommunication.        
	Repeated efforts to get the hotel authorities to comment on the matter failed on Tuesday.

										      BOOK BAZAAR                        US Consul General Beth A. Payne and Stephen P. Huyler at the book launch. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta				                           
	Two days after International Womens Day, a power-packed gathering of city women, with Bharati Ray, Krishna Bose, Mandira Sen and Shamlu Dudeja, led by US Consul General Beth A. Payne, cheered the launch of Stephen P. Huylers Daughters of India: Art and Identity, published by Mapin.         
	Mapin Publishing is known for its list of coffee table books, magnum size books on Indian art, crafts, photography, architecture and museum and gallery catalogues. Daughters of India is an addition to its list: a well-produced large format book, it is a pictorial narrative of the lives of 20 women who have used their creativity as a means of empowerment.         
	Daughters of India narrates the tale of Surabai of Chhattisgarh, who was confined to the outskirts of her village by her psychopath husband and found release in sculpting jalis and toys that would win her the Presidents Award and change the economy of the entire region.         
	It also tells the story of the urban Achama Joseph of Kochi, who after being abandoned by her merchant navy husband, started night classes on computers and went on to build a $13-billion empire employing 200 women.         
	Huylers lens captures the colours and conditions of their lives in vivid details. The book is as much about women as about art and photography.         
	Scavenger amp; artist        
	What catches the eye about A Triptych is its stark cover in black and white with the image of a mask. Or is it a doll? Dipanjan Rai Chaudhuris three novellas, packed between the two covers of A Triptych and published by Niyogi Books, tell tales of a scavenger and an artist, of a city girl and a country outcaste, a rebel and a child in a village who looks upon the rebel as his own.         
	Given Rai Chaudhuris background of studying physics in Presidency College in the turbulent Sixties and early Seventies, one is not surprised by this strangely diverse yet convergent worlds.         
	What is even more striking is the authors wide-ranging eclectic interests. A physicist by training and profession, he dabbles in philosophy, poetry and politics.         
	A prolific writer, Rai Chaudhuri has already published two volumes of poetry in Bengali, several books on the political economy of West Bengal and childrens books on science. With A Triptych, he has now turned to the art of fiction.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Met is music to Mamata ears
                                                                                                               Met is music to Mamata ears
          OUR BUREAU                          COLA COMRADE: A CPM supporter on Sunday morning sports a Che T-shirt and carries a cola drink. Political leaders and foot soldiers are struggling to beat the heat this election season. Picture by Aranya Sen                                  
	With three days to go for the Calcutta polls Mamata Banerjee is more bothered about the Alipore Meteorological Office than about Alimuddin Street.        
	Ufff... ki gorom. Para jachche na... Aaj brishti holey khub bhalo hoy (Its so hot Unbearable Would be great if it rains today), sighed Mamata, dabbing the sweat on her brow with her pallu, before leaving the Press Club after meeting reporters on a sultry Sunday afternoon.        
	The maximum temperature on Sunday slid nearly three degrees to 38.6 degrees Celsius but the maximum relative humidity rose five points to touch a sweltering 92 percent.        
	Mamatas prayers of rain in the poll week could be answered, with the Alipore Met Office forecast of rain and thundershower in south Bengal over the next 24 hours, which should significantly lower temperatures in and around Calcutta.        
	On Monday there is a possibility of respite in the form of isolated rain or thundershowers in south-west south Bengal and in various parts of north Bengal and Sikkim, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the regional meteorological centre at Alipore.                    
	The man whose words seem to hold more worth than Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees for Mamata in the final countdown, went on to elaborate why the week ahead could be better than the weekend.        
	A trough of low pressure over Bihar and Orissa, coupled with a cyclonic formation over north Bengal, make the conditions favourable for rain in south Bengal. The showers would lead to a significant lowering of temperatures in and around the city, said Debnath.        
	If the Trinamul boss with a sore throat betrayed signs of the heat getting to her on Sunday afternoon, the only tell-tale sign from the chief minister earlier in the day, on a makeshift podium near Deshapriya Park, was the wiping of his spectacles as sweat trickled down his brow.        
	After the hottest day this season on Saturday, when the mercury touched 42.1 degrees Celsius, Sundays temperatures ranged between a moderate 38.6 degrees Celsius (three degrees above normal) and 29 degrees Celsius (three degrees above normal).        
	But the rise in humidity levels made up for the Celsius slide. With the humidity readings ranging between 92 per cent and 49 per cent, without any rainfall, the discomfort index soared to 14 degrees above normal at 68.6 degrees Celsius.        
	The discomfort index, a measure of the degree of discomfort experienced by an individual in warm weather, is a combination of temperature and humidity. In Calcutta, the normal level for the index is 55 degrees Celsius.        
	The discomfort was all too visible in a sweat-drenched city on Sunday, from political meetings to Tollywood studios. They should seriously think of holding the elections in winter from next time. This is inhuman; the leaders come and go in air-conditioned cars but we have to brave the sun for hours, grumbled Anup, a political foot soldier.        
	Leading lady Rituparna Sengupta was also hot under the collar after shooting in sauna city. The heat is taking a toll on everything we do, she said, but added that the election results were also on her mind (see box).        
	The maximum temperature eased a bit on Sunday because the hot, dry westerlys were partially arrested. But the cyclonic formation over north Bengal and a trough of low pressure over Bihar, parts of Jharkhand and Orissa pushed the humidity up, which resulted in the high discomfort index, said the weatherman.        
	G.K. Mohanty, the director of the neighbouring Met department in Ranchi, said that in the next two days Jharkhand and its neighbourhood would witness partly cloudy skies with a possibility of thunder activities towards afternoon or evening.

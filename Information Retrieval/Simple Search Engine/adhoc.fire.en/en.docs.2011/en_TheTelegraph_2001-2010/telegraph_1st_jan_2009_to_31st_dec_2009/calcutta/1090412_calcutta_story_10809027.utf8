The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | The R-word regime
                                                                                                               The R-word regime
          The recession is ripping our vocabulary apart, online, off-line, at pubs, at marriage bureaus. Metro eavesdrops                                      
	Want to catch up on Need for Speed ProStreet and ditch the girlfriend for the evening? Blame the recession.               
	Recession has not struck India, where the economy, so far, has not shrunk. Thats happened in the US. In India, we are only suffering a downturn  though that may mean job cuts, salary cuts and a constant fear of opening e-mail from the management.         
	But has not recession struck India? The dreaded word and its synonyms and its approximations, are everywhere. More than Nano, even at the height of Mamata Banerjees protests. Our language has changed forever. Also in Calcutta, though the distance between the city and New York may be around 13,000 km.         
	So wherever you go, its hard to escape the phrase: Ei recession-er bajare.         
	There may be enough reason. The global meltdown is getting widespread exposure. And even the vernacular press is focusing on enormous loss of employment in the US and the constant parallels drawn between the Great Depression and this meltdown isnt helping, says sociologist Prasanta Ray. The 1930s Depression wasnt as widely reported. It is thus natural for this to feed on the apprehensions of people and build up this fear psychosis, he adds.         
	A part of it can be called recessionitis.         
	The website www.urbandictionary.com describes the advent of the word in the western world. Recessionitis, the website says, stands for using the recession as an excuse to avoid anything that the purse may not allow. But as in the world abroad, so in the city.         
	Do not be surprised, therefore, if a friend cannot join you for dinner at a swank restaurant for fear of recession, though his company may not at all be considering job cuts. That is, if you have not already said no to what seemed like a dreadful but expensive dinner invoking the recession.         
	The slump is the saviour  ei recession-er bajare.         
	A friend of mine is not really affected by the downturn, but uses it as an excuse not to go partying or eat out with his girlfriend. It works most of the time and he gets to catch up on his soccer, with his girlfriend none the wiser, says Golf Green resident Pawan Sharma.        
	People are wary of popcorn. If conversations online and off-line were monitored, it would lead to countless instances of the dreaded R-word being bandied about and weekend plans going haywire. Existential angst in Calcutta has just got a sharper edge.         
	Web of woes        
	At 11.15pm, two friends are chatting online. Be prepared for the calm, resigned tone and a sense that nothing is right with the world. It never was, but its definitely worse now.         
	So Debjani says: What we doing on Sunday?         
	Mandira: Janina rotting at home probably.         
	D: Wanna catch a movie?         
	M: Erm okay, cant afford a multiplex though. I cant not do popcorn, and cant afford to spend Rs 70 on them. No movies at multiplexes.         
	D: Hmmm, recession.         
	Life outside the multiplex is no better. The security personnel at the shopping mall entrance are not the only forbidding factor. Neither is alcohol a soothing idea. Escape routes are closing. One is trapped, in ones own misery.         
	So Debjani says: No shopping. Or going to malls.         
	M: Booze? Oly?         
	D: Costs money. Must save save save.         
	M: So what does that leave us with?         
	D: Recession.         
	Is boredom a creation of the recession too? asks Rupa in her Facebook status message.         
	The virtual world, in fact, is teeming with recession, in more than one sense.         
	Mrinalini Sengupta, 26, logs into her Gmail account as soon as she reaches her office. Out of the 7 new messages, three are recession-related forwards. Out of the 12 people showing online on her friends list, four have their status messages lamenting the downturn.         
	The word Slumpdog is gaining currency, too. Kanchan Jaiswal claims to be one. (And so do a bunch of real estate businessmen from Chennai, who are calling themselves Slump Dog Paupers, perhaps with more reason).         
	People are being forced to make the right choices. Madhumita declares the downturn has imposed vegetarianism on her: she is going greenmeat is too expensive.         
	Mrinalinis fortune for the day on Orkut is the ultimate philosophical statement: Recession is a state of mind. Though she doesnt add that it may have been true for Calcutta for a long time.         
	PSU boys in, IT out        
	If theres paranoia about IT, there is widespread fear about the IT boys in the marriage market too. The IT groom is no longer that desirable  ei recession-er bajare.         
	My mashi understands nothing of the recession, but shes suddenly wary of the new rishta from an NRI software engineer thats come her daughters way, says a 27-year-old employee of a publishing house. The Silicon Valley dude is no longer the catch, but the public sector employee, on the brink of a pay revision, is. That is good investment.         
	For the past six months, we have been getting more enquiries for government and public sector employees, especially those in the railways and the income tax divisions. Interest in IT grooms has waned in the last two months, says Geeta Chanda of Bandhan, a Salt Lake marriage bureau.         
	But you are not expected to ditch your partner  ei recession-er bajare. Deepanjan Mullick, dumped by his girlfriend of two years, is not left alone. How could she do this to him, ei shomoye? Especially when he is so tense because his company has started laying off employees in its US office, says an outraged common friend. Its like sensitivity has been hit by the recession! she adds.         
	The workplace, too, is teeming with the word recession. Even offices spared by salary cuts. So a colleague drops by a younger one. The latter is engrossed in work. Why are you working so hard, ei recession-er bajare? he asks.         
	We are waiting for someone to say: How can I put on weight, ei recession-er bajare?  
	the dark night and other rules  
	Some Calcutta organisations are looking beyond handing out pink slips or holding back the annual increment to tide through the trying times.             
	 A hotel, a telecom major and a manufacturing concern have adopted the lights off, AC off policy from early evening. ldquo;We walk into office by 10am every day and exactly at 7pm, the power is shut off. Pending work, including presentations, have to be finished at home, rdquo; says an employee of the telecom company.   
	 An Indo-Japanese company in the city has asked its employees to stay away from office on most days of the week, preferring them to work either from the field or from home.   
	 The downturn has forced some software companies in Sector V to do away with free meals ndash; lunches and/or dinners ndash; for the employees. ldquo;One day in early March we received mail asking us to get food from home henceforth. The mail even specified the amount the company spends to feed each one of us, rdquo; says an employee.   
	 Unlimited cups of tea or coffee in a day ndash; something that most offices did not even bat an eyelid over even a few months ago ndash; are vanishing. ldquo;It rsquo;s now no more than one cup in the morning and one in the evening. The office-boy has been instructed to lock the vending machine so that no one can have more than the designated two cups, rdquo; says an employee of an Elgin Road firm.   
	 A telecom service provider now rations office stationery mdash; even keeping a count of the A4 sheets and clips handed out to an employee. ldquo;At a time, we are given just enough to last us a week. The approval for even a box of board-pins has to travel through various levels of hierarchy, rdquo; says a company source.   
	 Another company has reduced the use of toiletries, which includes tissues and soap, in its employee washrooms as well as the number of washrooms. ldquo;Our office is spread over four floors with each floor having a washroom. But now only one washroom is available while the others are closed to save costs, rdquo; says an employee of the south Calcutta firm.   
	 And have you noticed how some city theatres have reduced the size of their tickets and how home-delivery pizza joints are not as generous with their pamphlets anymore?      PRIYANKA ROY AND MALINI BANERJEE

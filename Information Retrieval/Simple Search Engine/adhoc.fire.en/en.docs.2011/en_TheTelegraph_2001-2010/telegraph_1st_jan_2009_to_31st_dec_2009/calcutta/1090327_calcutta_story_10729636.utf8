The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fugitive in net after 11 years
                                                                                                               Fugitive in net after 11 years
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Murder accused Mohammed Sajjad was arrested from a fair at Pathar Chapari in Suri, Birbhum, on Thursday morning after being on the run for 11 years.        
	In his mid-40s, Sajjad was arrested in connection with the murder of Ram Chandra Singh on July 14, 1993.        
	Singh, the caretaker of a building, was strangled to death with a leather belt and a handkerchief and dumped outside a house on Dhiren Dhar Sarani in Muchipara. Investigations revealed the assassins wanted a share of the lakhs Ram Chandras wife had earned by selling kerosene in the black market.        
	Cops from the detective department arrested Sajjad and his accomplice Mohammed Sahid three years later. A lower court convicted the duo in 1997. Sajjad moved the high court and sought bail, which was granted. He went missing soon after.        
	We had received a tip-off that Sajjad would turn up at the fair in Pathar Chapari this year. We arrested him as he was setting up his stall, said a senior officer.        
	Late on Thursday, a team comprising officers from the detective department and the officer-in-charge of Sinthee police station returned to Calcutta with Sajjad. We will try to find out where he was all these years, said the officer.         
	Friends arrested        
	Three friends of 24-year-old engineering student Ashis Banerjee who died on Tuesday in Bally were arrested on Thursday and produced in a Howrah court.         
	Abhishek Roy, in whose house Ashis was found dead, Arpan Banerjee and Suman Maity were remanded in police custody for five days. They have been charged with murder and tampering with evidence.        
	Abhishek and Ashis were part of a band and had spent Monday night jamming, with the other two watching. A preliminary post-mortem report suggested that the Agarpara resident had been smothered to death.         
	There were injuries on his neck and other parts of the body, said an investigator. He added that the trio admitted to attacking Ashis with sharp objects after an argument.

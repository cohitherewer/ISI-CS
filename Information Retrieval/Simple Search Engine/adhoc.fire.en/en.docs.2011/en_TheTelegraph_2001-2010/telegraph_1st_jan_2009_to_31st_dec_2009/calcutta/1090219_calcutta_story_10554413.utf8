                                                                                                               25 bogies jump rails, block track

	A goods trains derailed near Benapur in West Midnapore, six days after the Coromandel Express mishap further south on the same line, throwing services haywire on the Howrah-Chennai route for at least 36 hours.        
	Twenty-five wagons of a coal-laden train jumped rails between Narayangarh and Benapur stations around 5.25am, blocking both Up and Down lines, a South Eastern Railway official said. Services on the lines have been affected, with several trains being cancelled, short-terminated or diverted.        
	The divisional railway manager (Kharagpur), Anil Handa, said two cranes had been pressed into service to remove the bogies but the tracks were unlikely to be cleared in the next 24 hours.        
	Sources said normal services could resume only after 36 hours.        
	Following the Coromandel accident at Jajpur-Keonjhar Road station in Orissa, the railway authorities had taken around 30 hours to clear the tracks though they had set themselves a deadline of 60 hours.        
	The authorities arranged for buses to ferry the stranded passengers of the Howrah-bound Sri Jagannath Express and Mysore Special to Kharagpur, where they were put on a special train to Howrah.        
	Officials said trains to and from Bhubaneswar, Chennai, Hyderabad, Bangalore and Ernakulam would be disrupted in the next two days. Trains from north India that usually take the Howrah-Chennai route will be diverted.        
	Divisional railway manager Handa and other senior officials visited Benapur and are monitoring the situation.

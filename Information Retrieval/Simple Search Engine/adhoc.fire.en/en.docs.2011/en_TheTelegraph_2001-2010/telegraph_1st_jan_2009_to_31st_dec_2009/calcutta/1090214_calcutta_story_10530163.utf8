The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Afghan vs Afghans
                                                                                                               Afghan vs Afghans
          A STAFF REPORTER                          AVENGING AFGHAN: Said Khan on Friday                                  
	Hell hath no fury as an Afghan duped.        
	A resident of Kabul has landed in Calcutta looking for two fellow Afghans who borrowed money from him five years ago and didnt repay, proving once again that a Kabuliwallah never gives up on his cash.        
	They have troubled me a lot and I will return home only after recovering my money, Said Khan, 55, told Metro on Friday.        
	Khan told CID officials that Rahmatullah and Rahmanullah, who allegedly duped him of Rs 20 lakh, were staying in Howrah and he met them after arriving in the city last week. The duo misbehaved with me when I asked them to return my money. They threatened to hand me over to the police if I did not leave the flat, he said.        
	The businessman, who runs a fuel pump in Kabul, and his 30-year-old son Arif had first met deputy inspector-general of police (operations) S.N. Gupta. Father and son then lodged a complaint with the CID on Thursday.        
	Khan said Rahmatullah and Rahmanullah were from Ghazni, near Kabul, but hadnt returned to their families since fleeing that country with his money. They have made more money in this city and even own a car each. I have informed the duos wives about their whereabouts, he added.         
	Khan said he obtained the address of the flat in Howrah town where Rahmatullah and Rahmanullah have been living for a year from Afghans involved in moneylending. More than 1,000 people from Afghanistan stay in the city and its suburbs.        
	According to Khan, Rahmatullah and Rahmanullah have been staying in the country without valid papers. They came here as tourists and stayed back. I have heard from other Afghan nationals that they are involved in hawala transactions, he said.        
	This is Khans second visit to Calcutta. He first came six years ago for medical treatment.        
	Gupta confirmed receiving a complaint from Khan and said he referred the businessman and his son to Howrah police. The complaint against Rahmatullah and Rahmanullah is being investigated.        
	A CID official said this was the first instance in town of an avenging Afghan complaining against two persons of his community. People who take loans from Kabuliwallahs are hounded if they default on repayment. It took two Kabuliwallahs to dupe another.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Next weekend you can be at ...   Kaluk
                                                                                                               Next weekend you can be at ...   Kaluk
                                                          
	Tucked in the midst of the undulating mountains of west Sikkim is the village of Kaluk. Its solitude and pollution-free environment is a world away from the hustle and bustle of city life. And you get a breathtaking view of the mighty Kanchenjungha and lush green slopes right from your hotel room.        
	We stayed at the Ghonday Village Resort, which was a home away from home. Well-furnished and beautifully decorated with traditional Sikkimese handicrafts, the village resort was as comfortable as it was welcoming. Not many people know about this place, making it an ideal destination for a quiet weekend.         
	On our arrival, we were greeted by the resort staff in traditional Sikkimese style and served tea in local ware.         
	There is no chef here, no F amp;B manager, no GM operations. Instead, the hospitality is entirely personal with a motley staff of four village women and three men looking after your every need. They are extremely courteous and serve guests with a smile that lingers on. There are a dozen beautiful rooms and cottages and the food is organic  fresh and healthy.         
	The dining hall is serviced from an open kitchen and even guests can participate in the cooking if they wish to.        
	Our daily grind of city life often takes a toll on our health and we land up at the doctors chamber with various ailments. A stay in the lap of nature in Kaluk will cure you of most of your ailments!         
	The best thing to do in Kaluk is to laze, and enjoy nature at its pristine best.         
	We enjoyed a leisurely holiday and experienced the sound of silence at the dizzy height of 5,500 feet above sea level. We walked to Richenpong village, 3 km from the resort and to a nearby small bazar, which is flush with imported Chinese goods.         
	We also ventured towards the forest, which beckoned the nature-lover in us. Some tourists also make day trips to Ravongla, Geysing, Pelling and Hilley.         
	One can visit Kaluk round the year, except perhaps the monsoon. A winter trip is particularly recommended as it offers a panoramic view of the snow-capped Himalayan peaks. Though winters are chilly in west Sikkim, the resort kept us warm and comfortable.        
	While we were leaving, village girls in traditional attire bade us farewell, with the hope that we would return soon.  
	Going   
	Take a train to New Jalpaiguri or a flight to Bagdogra and hire a car. It will take around four and a half hours to reach Kaluk via Jorethang.   
	Pick-up and drop services are provided by Ghonday Village Resort.   
	Staying  
	Ghonday Village Resort is a good option. Tariff is between Rs 1,200 and Rs 2,500. Room heaters are provided at an extra cost.   
	Other resorts are also available.

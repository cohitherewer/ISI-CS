The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | PG must with autonomy
                                                                                                               PG must with autonomy
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta University will make it mandatory for autonomous colleges earlier affiliated to it to start postgraduate courses for their students.        
	The decision follows a controversy over fixing the criteria for admitting students from St Xaviers College  the first undergraduate institution in the city to have been declared autonomous  to PG courses of the university. The 2009 class is the first to graduate from Xaviers since it was granted autonomy in 2006.        
	Ramakrishna Mission Residential College, Narendrapur, is the only other college in the city functioning as an autonomous institution. The first batch since the college received the tag will graduate in 2012.        
	Autonomous colleges once affiliated to CU will have to ensure that all their students who are willing to pursue postgraduate studies can do so in their own institutions, said vice-chancellor Suranjan Das.        
	Senior officials of the university will discuss the issue on June 22 before writing to the authorities of St Xaviers and the Ramakrishna Mission college.        
	We have already started some postgraduate courses and are planning to scale them up to cover all subjects, said Father Felix Raj, the principal of St Xaviers College. No deadline has been set yet for launching more courses.        
	The Ramakrishna Mission college has been running PG courses in chemistry and physics and is set to introduce one in English in the 2009-10 session. Vice-principal Swami Puratanananda said: We are yet to hear from the university but given the present infrastructure of the college, it will be difficult to launch any more PG course right now.        
	Sources said once the autonomous colleges start PG courses in all subjects, the university will not have to face the unpleasant task, as it has on its hands this year, of fixing the admission criteria for students from these institutions.        
	Several university officials and college principals are of the view that students from the autonomous colleges should not be treated on a par with those graduating from affiliated colleges.        
	A committee set up in February, however, suggested that students from autonomous colleges should not be deemed outsiders and should be accommodated within 95 per cent of the seats in PG courses reserved for students from affiliated campuses.        
	But the members also pointed out that since Xaviers followed the semester system  holding exams every six months  and the university held tests once a year, a method should be worked out to establish a parity between the sets of marks.        
	The university syndicate has formed a six-member panel to suggest how to achieve the balancing act.

	It feels good to be recognised in, and recognised by, ones own country, says Neel Mukherjee, after winning the 2008 Vodafone-Crossword book award for fiction for his debut novel, Past Continuous. Mukherjee shares the award with Amitav Ghosh (for Sea of Poppies), who had the odds firmly on his side right from the beginning.         
	Mukherjee now has nothing to regret the last-minute decision he made to fly in from London for the July 23 awards function in Mumbai. But with such big names as Salman Rushdie and Jhumpa Lahiri on the fiction shortlist, he didnt pin his hopes too high. He had,in fact, begun to relax a bit when Ghoshs name was called out and the music began to play. The suspense was finally over, he thought. But not quite. The music stopped abruptly, and the Past Continuous author heard his name being announced as the joint winner.        
	Mukherjee says he did not have a Miss Universe moment. Instead, he calmly proceeded to dedicate his award to those who have been fighting against Article 377 in India.         
	The paperback edition of Past Continuous, with a new cover, has just been brought out by Picador, and the novel will be published in the West by Constable and Robinson in January 2010, under the new title, A Life Apart.        
	Four out of the seven authors shortlisted this year (besides Ghosh, Mukherjee and Lahiri, there was Anuradha Roy) are Bengalis, and not a single years shortlist has been without a Bengali name. Is this pure coincidence?        
	Mukherjee, a Jadavpur University department of English alumnus, feels secretly thrilled imagining a rest-of-India literary fraternity enviously trying to find out what makes Bengalis such successful writers. If asked ever, Mukherjee has a good mind to say that the secret lies in the diet of fish heads and fish eyes that Bengali children are brought up on.        
	The invisible man        
	A man in his 40s now, who like his siblings was born and raised on the pavement of Prinsep Street in front of Commerce House, had about a decade ago gone missing.         
	When he was in his 20s, puny and underfed, he had lost his mind. He used to wander around aimlessly, muttering to himself. He had a shaggy head of hair and a straggling beard, and looked like he hadnt had a bath for ages.         
	Then one day he disappeared. Since his parents had lived on the very same pavement for about half a century, and people of the neighbourhood had seen them grow up, the mans absence had been noticed.         
	Where had he disappeared, people wondered. Had he been run over by a passing vehicle? Or was he killed in some other horrible accident? Perhaps drowned in Laldighi in Dalhousie Square, as vagrants occasionally do? But then that would not have gone unnoticed. Had he fallen victim to an organ racket? Or had he decided to walk away from family? But why should he do that considering that his siblings always fed him the scraps they gathered all day?         
	He may have led a barely human existence, but there was no denying that his disappearance was mysterious.        
	Then 10 years or perhaps more later, the man was suddenly back in Prinsep Street. The young man had turned middle-aged but it could not have been anybody else. He was seen having a free meal offered to beggars and vagrants. Then the police swooped down on the man and his neighbours on the pavement. The man was picked up. There was nobody there to bail him out. So he rotted in jail (or was it the vagrants home?) for a decade. Fortunately, his sisters had found out that he was to be released and he was rescued at last.         
	Now he is back again on the pavement. Will anyone count how many years of his life he has spent missing or behind bars? Does anyone bother?         
	Has anyone really seen him at all?         
	Party fashion        
	Underground, they were busy making plans. The Chandni Chowk Metro station, with barely minutes to go for the start of the July 21 Mamata Banerjee meeting, was chock-a-block with men who crowded in front of the fare chart and discussed which station would be closest to the zoo. They were Trinamul supporters bunking the event.         
	Above, on Central Avenue, their more dutiful colleagues flaunted their party colours with pride. In the majority were those with paper badges, led by local leaders brandishing the party flag as Bheema would wield his mace. A lucky few had more on them to prove their political identity. A youth wore a tricolour cap which sought votes for Mamata in south Calcutta. A woman from Sodepur came in a sari with the party symbol  ghash phool  blooming all over it.         
	But once it started to pour, it was those with the Trinamul umbrellas who were sporting the broadest grins.         
	Goto vote-ey Arunda amader chhata diyechhey. Arundar naamta please ektu note korben, said a cadre mindful of mileage for his para leader.         
	The umbrella have-nots soon struck back. The flex banners that were lining the iron railings in the divider were ripped off and served as shelter for Didis legions.

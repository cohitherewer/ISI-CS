          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Political will and a common-sense approach are key to solving the land-for-development riddle, feels real estate guru John D. Macomber.        
	The 53-year-old lecturer in real estate at Harvard Business School was speaking as the guest of honour at a Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) session on sustainable development in urban infrastructure and the construction sector on Wednesday.        
	There cant be a global template for land-taking. The issue is best addressed through regional knowledge about the needs and aspirations of the landholders, backed by a strong political vision, succinctly explaining the spin-offs of development, Macomber said.        
	The professor, whose professional background includes leadership of real estate, construction, services and technology businesses, stressed that creation of urban infrastructure would always involve a certain element of risk.         
	But the long-term benefits are always more than worth the risk. So ways and means must be found to attract the private sector to plug the gap in infrastructure needs, said Macomber, who is using the upcoming Bengal Shrachi township project in Burdwan as a case study for his students.        
	A partner in several real estate projects in Massachusetts, Macomber has worked in several urban infrastructure and sustainable development initiatives around the world.         
	He and his students have also studied the Dharavi slum-rehab project in Mumbai and are keen to take up more such case studies in India.        
	The US expert also advocated aligning the private sector in environment-protection initiatives besides entry-level housing, while stressing the need for the government agencies to extend honest assurances and guarantees.

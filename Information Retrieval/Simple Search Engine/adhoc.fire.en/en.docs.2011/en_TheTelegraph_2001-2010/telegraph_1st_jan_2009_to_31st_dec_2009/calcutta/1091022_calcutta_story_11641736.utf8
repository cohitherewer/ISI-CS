The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Plea for CBI probe into Vedic
                                                                                                               Plea for CBI probe into Vedic
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Two residents of Chandpur village in Rajarhat filed a public interest litigation in the high court on Wednesday seeking a CBI probe into the August 23 flare-up at Vedic Village.        
	Court sources said the division bench headed by Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar would hear the plea on October 24.        
	The petition was filed by a former panchayat pradhan of Chandpur, Badruddin Ahmed, and the president of a local club, Prosenjit Ghosh. Their lawyer, R.N. Das, said: About two months have passed since the incident but local residents are still in the dark about the details and the government has not taken concrete steps to punish the culprits.        
	The area around Vedic Village erupted during a football match on August 23. A youth was shot before a mob attacked the resort and set it on fire.        
	The arson attack on Vedic Village opened a can of worms and brought into focus how a promoter-politician nexus was forcing villagers to sell their land at rates below the market price.        
	The government will not allow any of its investigating agencies to conduct a thorough probe into the matter. So we have demanded that the CBI investigate the case, added Ahmed.        
	Anwar Ali, the advocate- on-record of the petition, said: The government had sent some officers to probe the incident. The officers had submitted a report, but the government did not reveal the findings. Now the government has announced that another investigation would be conducted. Is it not a farce?         
	Counsel representing the state refused comment. Whatever we have to say, we will say in court, Subrata Mukhopadhyay, the standing counsel of the state, said.

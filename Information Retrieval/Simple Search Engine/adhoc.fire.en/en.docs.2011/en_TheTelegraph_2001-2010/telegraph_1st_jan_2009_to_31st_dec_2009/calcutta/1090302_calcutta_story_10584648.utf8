The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Goof-up in green management
                                                                                                               Goof-up in green management

	The state of the greens managed by the state government proves why the defence ministry should not take kindly to Team Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee laying claim to the citys lungs: the Maidan.         
	If Curzon Park has been reduced to a colony of rats and the old Howrah Maidan to a maze of concrete, Subodh Mullick Square is a filth-ridden club and commercial zone and Subhash Sarovar a colony of squatters.        
	Metro reports on the degeneration of the historical central Calcutta square and the citys eastern oasis under the governments care.        
	SUBODH MULLICK SQUARE        
	Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose resigned as president of the Indian National Congress here in 1939, a plaque at the entrance to Subodh Mullick Square informs you.         
	You try to imagine what this central Calcutta complex looked like in Netajis time but your sense of perception is overpowered by the sights and sounds beyond the gate.         
	An assortment of waste  polythene packets, torn shoes, banana peels, paper plates and broken concrete slabs  lies scattered across the dustbowl that was once a lush carpet of green.         
	Some teenaged boys are playing cards behind Netajis statue, caked in dust. Stacks of bamboo in a corner announce an impending event.         
	You will find urchins loitering here at any time of day. They drink, gamble and smoke ganja. This place has lost its glory, says Shaktipada Das, the caretaker of the park for 19 years. I cant do anything if the authorities themselves dont care about the maintenance of the complex.        
	Dass only task is to lock the main gate every evening. Not that he seems to mind the lack of work. He uses his free time to make some extra money by running an eatery, Hindu Hotel, on the premises.         
	There are more shacks elsewhere in the square, most of them canteens attached to the clubs of the area  Bowbazar Byam Samity, Jog Byam Kendra, The Gymnasium and The School of Physical Culture. One of the shacks is a furniture storeroom.         
	The chaos caused by shops and food stalls on the pavement leading to the square mirrors the state of affairs beyond the walls.         
	The councillor of ward No. 52, Sanchita Mondal, said the Calcutta Municipal Corporation was aware of the problems and had lodged a complaint about encroachment with Muchipara police station around two months ago. The police have to take action if the square and its surroundings are to be restored to their original state, she said.              
	SUBHASH SAROVAR        
	The 97.9-acre oasis in the eastern part of the city, opposite Swabhumi, is a lesson in how not to manage a place as precious as this.         
	Subhash Sarovar has been overrun by squatters, some of whom have built semi-concrete structures across the complex. The ones who cannot afford brick homes or mud shanties live under tarpaulin tents or inside the Hume pipes dumped by government agencies.         
	Debris floats on the sprawling lake where the squatters and residents of the nearby slums bathe and wash clothes every day. The greens are dumping grounds for waste and free parking spaces for rickshaws and taxis.         
	The fountain on the Beleghata side has long ceased to work and the playing arenas around the water body have become storage sites for scrap dealers.         
	Some of the other grounds, like the one shared by Beliaghata Mahadeb Club and East Calcutta Medical Club, do not have a blade of grass. A family of settlers  and their goats and pigs  has taken over one portion. Washermen hang clothes out to dry on the other patches of green.        
	The Calcutta Improvement Trust and the West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation had announced a grand plan to develop Subhash Sarovar but work has yet to begin.              
	 Rith Basu

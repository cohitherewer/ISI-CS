The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Resurgence? Sorry, its stuck in rally raj
                                                                            Tuesday , November 10 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Resurgence? Sorry, its stuck in rally raj
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	A motion debated and defeated over the weekend at Calcutta Club  that a resurgent Bengal is an impossible dream  was passed unopposed on the rally-choked streets of Calcutta on the first day of a new week.        
	If Mamata Banerjees pitch at The Telegraph-Calcutta Club National Debate on Saturday was about dreaming the impossible, two rallies showcasing the politics of disruption on either side of town  and on either side of the political divide  on Monday were all about waking up to reality.        
	The reality of rally raj in a city where political colours can change but not the brand of politics.        
	Mamata led a 1.5-km Trinamul Congress march from College Square to the Metro channel around noon to protest CPM-sponsored terrorism, while the CPM rally brigade descended on north Calcutta later in the day to drum up a campaign against price rise and Maoists. In the end, neither side did much more than heap misery on commuters.        
	The thing that hurts is not so much the disruption caused by a rally as the intention to disrupt. A dais that occupies almost an entire flank of a busy thoroughfare like this says it all, said Arimita Ghosh, pointing to a platform built for CPM leaders less than 100 metres from the crucial Shyambazar five-point crossing.        
	In terms of disruption, the Trinamul rally was the traffic bully of the day, bringing the central business district to a standstill between noon and 2.30pm. Lenin Sarani, SN Banerjee Road, College Street, Madan Street, parts of AJC Bose Road, CR Avenue, Jawaharlal Nehru Road and APC Road bore the brunt of the Mamata march.         
	Maniktala resident Alokananda Chowdhury, stranded along with her ailing daughter in a taxi at Lenin Sarani for 30 minutes, said it was frustrating to see the party-in-waiting and those it aspired to dislodge resorting to the same disruptive methods in the name of protest. I wonder how blocking roads in this manner can endear anyone to the electorate, added Alokananda, consoling her coughing daughter.        
	Ratna Mukherjee, a student at Calcutta University stuck in traffic, said Bengal could never be resurgent as long as the ruling party and the alternative were two sides of the same coin.        
	By the time traffic was back to normal in central and south Calcutta, snarls started building up in the north with a rally organised by the CPMs north Calcutta zonal committee slowing down evening traffic at Shyambazar.        
	The meeting started at 6.30pm with just about 50 people but the assembly grew larger as the minutes ticked away. Why do they choose locations like these. Dont they know that this is the heart of north Calcutta? I think they know but dont care, said 35-year-old Timir Mitra.        
	With half of one flank of Bhupen Bose Avenue being blocked by the dais, commuters waiting for transport had a difficult time boarding buses. I dont think political parties are at all concerned about the ordinary commuter. Otherwise, would they hold rallies and take out processions at such locations? said a 60-year-old man at the bus stop.        
	Student Sourav Ganguly, pursuing a bachelors degree in computer applications, hit Mamatas argument that there was nothing to fear for a six. Let her and her political rivals first stop organising traffic-stopper rallies.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Makeover for defence shipyard 
                                                                                                               Makeover for defence shipyard 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A modernisation project has set sail to provide defence shipyard, Garden Reach Shipbuilders amp; Engineers Limited, an extra edge.        
	Two concrete jetties, a dry dock (180m long, 29m wide and 10m deep) and portable shelters for ships under construction will be built and a Goliath Crane of 250-tonne capacity acquired under the scheme.        
	The modernisation of the 125-year-old company, a public sector unit under the ministry of defence, will cost about Rs 525 crore. The ministry will provide the funds.         
	The minister of state for defence productions, Rao Inderjit Singh, flagged off the project at the 43/46 Garden Reach Road address on Thursday morning.         
	Once the modernisation is completed, Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers will be able to construct four large warships simultaneously. The time taken to build a ship will also come down with the adoption of modern methods and elimination of stoppages because of bad weather, said Singh.        
	The drive to modernise the shipyard had started in 2001 with the objective to build better ships in shorter time. The current project is a continuation of the drive, said a quality control officer of the company. The modernisation of the yard is scheduled to be completed by mid-2011.        
	The shipyard at Garden Reach is one of the three  the others are in Mumbai and Goa  that supply to the navy and the coast guard. Some of the most sophisticated vessels in the navys fleet, including the recently inducted INS Car Nicobar and INS Kesari, have been built at Garden Reach.        
	Submarines, however, cannot be constructed in the city shipyard because of inadequate depth of water.

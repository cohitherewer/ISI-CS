The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Man held for mid-air harassment
                                                                                                               Man held for mid-air harassment
          A STAFF REPORTER                                             
	A young NRI flying back home from Saudi Arabia was arrested on Tuesday on the charge of making indecent proposals to the American woman seated next to him on a four-hour flight from Dubai.        
	The victim told police that Anindya Mukherjee, in his 30s, made a pass at her immediately after she boarded the Emirates flight in the morning and harassed her throughout the journey. He was reeking of alcohol, she said.        
	The woman, who is in Calcutta to do her post-graduation, said she chose not to complain against him to the cabin crew because she did not want to create a scene. I thought we would go our separate ways after disembarking in Calcutta, and that would be the end of the story, an officer quoted her as saying.        
	But Anindya, whose family is based in Garia, allegedly pursued her even after stepping out of the international terminal. He was arrested after being spotted at the taxi stand allegedly pestering the woman to travel with him into the city.        
	Police personnel on duty outside the airport made enquiries after noticing the victim crying. They arrested Anindya after the woman said she was being harassed and some taxi drivers confirmed that he was insisting she accompany him, said an officer of the airport police station.         
	The victim filed a police complaint only after being assured that action would be taken against Anindya.         
	 She was crying all along and said that she had never felt so humiliated before, a police officer said.         
	The accused, who claimed to be an airline employee based in Saudi Arabia, has been charged with indecent behaviour and harassment.        
	He will be produced in court on Wednesday.         
	Anindya is not the first person to be arrested at Calcutta airport for allegedly misbehaving on a flight.        
	Dinesh Kumar Gupta, a 23-year old courier returning on a flight from Bangkok, was put behind bars a year ago for drunken misbehaviour with cabin crew.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rivalry takes toll on gym and pool
                                                                                                               Rivalry takes toll on gym and pool

	A swimming pool and a state-of-the-art gymnasium has been gathering dust over the past four years because of the rivalry between the CPM and the Trinamul Congress.        
	Built at a cost of Rs 1 crore, the APC Park Sports Complex in Kankurgachhi has been lying unused since it was unveiled by external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee in March 2005.        
	The tiled 7ft deep swimming pool, which has six tracks, is designed for children, but adults can use it for practice. There are provisions to fill the pool with filtered water from the Tallah pumping station. A filtration plant was installed in the complex to recycle the water.         
	The pool has attached facilities for steam bath, a changing room, toilets and a snacks corner.         
	Now the bed remains dry and the edge of the pool is used by civic workers to tend to potted plants.         
	The walls of the multi-gym have developed damps. Inside, costly equipment like treadmill, exercise cycles and bench press are turning rusty.         
	Face-off        
	The construction of the APC Park Sports Complex started in early 2004 following the initiative of former Trinamul Congress councillor Paresh Pal, when Subrata Mukherjee was the mayor.         
	Subrata Mukherjee had asked the Purba Kolkata Subhas Mela committee to look after the complexs upkeep, but the CPM took over the CMC before the agreement could be signed. So much money has been spent on this complex but the CPM-run CMC is yet to do anything about it, said Pal, the general secretary of the Subhas Mela committee.         
	Though the CPM-led civic body denies the clash of interests, it is wary of letting rival party members hold the reins at this sports address.         
	No committee was formed to run this pool when it was inaugurated in 2005. The Subhas Mela committee is not a civic body, so how can they run the complex? said the Maniktala MLA and chairperson of borough 3, Rupa Bagchi.         
	The swimming pools owned by the CMC are usually maintained by local clubs or organisations. But for the smooth running of the APC Park Sports Complex, we are planning to form a committee that will have sportsmen, the local councillor and local people as representatives, said Faiyaz Ahmad Khan, member, mayor-in-council of parks and gardens.

    ldquo;We will benefit if the CMC keeps the political rivalry aside and spares a thought for us. The rooms have termites as they are under lock and key. If the complex lies unused for a few more years, it will be completely destroyed. rdquo; mdash; Ram Narayan Nandy, who lives opposite the sports complex  ldquo;We were very happy to have a swimming pool in the locality and I had even collected a form to enrol my son for swimming lessons. But the complex is of no use. rdquo; mdash; Anima Goswami of 38 Kankurgachhi Second Lane  ldquo;My son attends swimming classes in Salt Lake, which is both time-consuming and expensive. rdquo; mdash; S.D.

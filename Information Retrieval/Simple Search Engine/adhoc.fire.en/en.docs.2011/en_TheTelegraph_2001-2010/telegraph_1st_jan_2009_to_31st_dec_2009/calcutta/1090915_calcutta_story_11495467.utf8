The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Techie duo held for cop assault
                                                                                                               Techie duo held for cop assault
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Two engineers of a software company were arrested on Monday morning on the charge of assaulting a traffic sergeant when he tried to book them for violating traffic laws.         
	Soumya Chatterjee and Abhishek Chatterjee, both residents of Behala, were taken to Alipore police station and later released on bail.         
	The police said that around 9.15am, traffic sergeant Sandipan Sarkar spotted a Maruti 800 speeding near the intersection of Diamond Harbour Road and Burdwan Road. While overtaking another vehicle, the driver of the speeding car allegedly breached the central line that demarcates the two flanks of a road and Sarkar asked the driver to stop.        
	The duo stepped out of the car and asked me why I had stopped them. I said they had violated traffic rules under Section 316 (III) of the Motor Vehicles Act, which deals with violation of the central line, Sarkar said.        
	According to the sergeant, he then filled out the compound slip  the receipt given to a traffic rule violator on the spot  and asked the duo to sign it.        
	But they threw away the slip. Then they caught me by the collar and started beating me for slapping a case on them. I tried to reason with them but they didnt pay heed to what I was saying. Their behaviour left me stunned. I informed Alipore police station and the two were arrested, Sarkar said.

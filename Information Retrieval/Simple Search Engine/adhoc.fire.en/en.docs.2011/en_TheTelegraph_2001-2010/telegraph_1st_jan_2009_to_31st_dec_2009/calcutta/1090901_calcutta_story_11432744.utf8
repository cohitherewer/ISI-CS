The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Their rally versus her rally   Footfall the party pooper
                                                                                                               Their rally versus her rally
   Footfall the party pooper																		      CROWD COUNT THROUGH HIS BINOCULARS, MAMATA ON HIS MIND      OUR BUREAU                        A plainclothes policeman (in picture by Amit Datta) keeps an eagle eye on the Left Front congregation at Esplanade on Monday afternoon, not to spot troublemakers but to match the headcount with that of Mamata Banerjees July 21 rally (in file picture right) that had drawn lakhs of supporters.				                                             
	The Left Front finished second-best in the battle of the rallies 40 days apart as it observed the golden jubilee of the food movement with an obsessive eye on the crowd and Mamata Banerjee on its mind.         
	Dekhe ja Mamata, CPM-er khomota (Come and take a look, Mamata, at what the CPM can do)  the party chant left nobody in doubt about what the rally that brought the city centre to a halt on Monday was all about. But by the end of the day, Mamata  more than the CPM bosses  would have liked what she saw.        
	Aami ja dekchhi 1.3 lakh-er kom hobe na, sir (As far as I can see, it wont be less than 1.3 lakh), one of the two plainclothes policemen perched near the dome of the Metropolitan Building at Esplanade with binoculars was heard saying over his walkie-talkie.        
	The duo were apparently stationed there not to keep an eye on troublemakers but to update their bosses about the crowd count every few minutes. As they scanned the gathering, a bevy of leaders spearheaded by Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Biman Bose and held fort on the ground.        
	The Left Front chairman, who had declared in the run-up to the rally that he expected a footfall of five to six lakh, said the turnout had exceeded our expectations.        
	Those who are worried about peoples participation in our rallies, and those sceptics who claim that footfalls are decreasing at Left Front gatherings should come and see this turnout, he thundered.        
	The chief minister said that the lakhs of people from distant villages in the gathering represented a turnaround for the Left Front.        
	But police personnel who were on duty on both July 21 and Mondays rally said that the Trinamul Congresss Martyrs Day congregation was larger.        
	A senior officer of the traffic department said spontaneity made the difference between the Trinamul congregation and the Left Front rally.         
	I was on duty that day, and I have not seen a more aggressive crowd. They were straining at the leash. The Left Front rally had a more organised crowd lacking the vigour of Mamatas show of strength. That showed in the numbers, he added.         
	So was the late Subhas Chakraborty, the most efficient crowd organiser in the CPM ranks, missed on Monday?        
	He was a peoples hero. He will forever be missed, said senior party leader Rabin Deb. But that doesnt mean his absence made a difference to the turnout, he added.        
	According to a conservative estimate, nearly 13 lakh people had joined Chakrabortys funeral procession last month.         
	Subhasdas funeral and a political rally cannot be compared. People from all walks of life had taken to the streets spontaneously, and across party lines, Deb said.        
	The CPM had been preparing for the rally for nearly a month, determined to show Mamata that when it comes to organising rallies nobody does it better than the Left.        
	No headcount was available but Mondays turnout proved that the challenger had caught up with the champions in yet another round of the political game in Bengal.

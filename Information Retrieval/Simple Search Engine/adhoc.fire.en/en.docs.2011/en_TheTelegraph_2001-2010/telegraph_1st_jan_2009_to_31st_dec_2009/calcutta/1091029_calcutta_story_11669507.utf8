The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Architect rues lack of ideas
                                                                                                               Architect rues lack of ideas
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Doshi at the interactive session. (Anindya Shankar Ray)                                  
	Poverty of ideas and a lack of social commitment in many of Indias contemporary architects could leave us with no skyline we can call our own two decades from now, fears visionary architect-planner Balkrishna Vithaldas Doshi.        
	What will happen to our cities after 20 years? We have no public realm, no urban development, no museums, no civic spaces and no institutions to inspire us, the Padmashri awardee lamented while speaking at an interactive session organised by Ambuja Realty at the CII Suresh Neotia Centre of Excellence for Leadership on Tuesday evening.        
	Doshi gave the city its first large-format, socio-economically tiered housing in the shape of Udayan, The Condoville. The architect, who had worked for four years (1951-54) with Le Corbusier as senior designer in Paris, and then in India to supervise Corbusiers projects in Ahmedabad and Chandigarh, felt modern India wasnt creating any architectural heritage we could be proud of 20 years on.        
	We should have more mixed-use clusters instead of segregated commercial, residential and administrative districts, Doshi said. He called upon students in the audience to draw inspiration from our ancient architecture, which was sensitive to the needs and aspirations of the people

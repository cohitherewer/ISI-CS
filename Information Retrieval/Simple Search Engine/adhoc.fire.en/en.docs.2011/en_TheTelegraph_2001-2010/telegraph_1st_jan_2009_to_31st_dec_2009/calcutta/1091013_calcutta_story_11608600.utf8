The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Enter, IT space within city limits
                                                                                                               Enter, IT space within city limits
  - 200,000sq ft building boost for beleaguered government, civic body          DEEPANKAR GANGULY AND CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE                                                  
	Singed by the Vedic Village fiasco and slowed down by infrastructure bottlenecks in Rajarhat, the state government is poised to create over 200,000sq ft of information technology (IT) space off the Bypass but within city limits.        
	The move by Webel and Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC)  months after the Vedic Village flare-up and months before the municipal polls  underlines the role of an IT zone as a vital calling card. If the government is desperate to regain some lost ground, the beleaguered CPM-steered CMC is keen that an IT flag flies high on its turf.        
	The new IT address will be behind Science City, with an investment of Rs 50 crore by the state government and the CMC. According to the agreement on Monday, the CMC and Webel will make initial investments of Rs 5 crore each. The two-acre plot will be provided by the CMC from the five acres that the Science City authority has handed over.        
	A memorandum of understanding is already in place and we are going to float an expression of interest for the IT Technopolis soon, state IT minister Debesh Das told Metro on Monday. We are positive that because of its location there will be no dearth of clients, he added.        
	If land cost is taken into account, the CMC will be investing Rs 120 crore at Rs 1 crore per cottah as well as a paid-up capital of Rs 5 crore initially, said municipal commissioner Arnab Ray.        
	This will be the governments fourth crack at creating an IT zone, but the first in the CMC area. The proposed IT city in the Jagadishpur mouza of Rajarhat was abandoned, an IT hub planned on 100 acres in Kalyani found no takers and the Kolkata IT Link project adjoining Vedic Village was buried under murky land deals.        
	Now, hopes are pinned on the IT building off the Bypass. We expect it to be functional by the end of 2010 and it will generate employment for around 2,000 people, said Das. A steering committee has been set up with two representatives from Webel and three from the CMC, along with Ray and IT secretary Siddharth. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is slated to lay the foundation stone next month.

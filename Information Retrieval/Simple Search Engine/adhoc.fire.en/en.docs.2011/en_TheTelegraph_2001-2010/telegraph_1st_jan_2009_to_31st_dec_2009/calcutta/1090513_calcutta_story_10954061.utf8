The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Three days of planning in highrise horror
                                                                                                               Three days of planning in highrise horror
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Sujit Kundu had planned the murder of his wife and father-in-law and his own suicide in advance, sleuths said on Tuesday.        
	The marine engineer did not act on the spur of the moment. He had possibly planned the act on Thursday night, said an investigating officer.        
	Kundu was found hanging from the ceiling fan and Pinki and Ajay Nath Pal lying murdered in separate rooms of the second-floor flat of a riverside housing estate in Watgunge on Sunday morning.        
	Sujit had possibly made up his mind when he left the flat in Merlin Riverview for his family home in Behala on his Royal Enfield motorcycle on Friday morning, the officer said. While returning, he left his two-wheeler in Behala and hired a taxi.        
	Family members said he was so fond of his motorcycle that he never left it at his Behala home. On Friday morning, he made an exception possibly because he knew he would never have to use it again, the officer added.        
	We suspect the twin murders and suicide occurred some time between Friday night and Saturday noon.        
	Sleuths said Sujit suspected his wife had an illicit relationship. He was also unhappy with Pinki because she continued to be friends with a female neighbour despite his objection.        
	We spoke to the two persons named by Sujit as being responsible for the tragic act but could not find any hint of foul play. Both were friends with Pinky, said an officer.        
	The investigators, however, are yet to trace the murder weapon, Pinkis cellphone and the three mobile phones that Sujit used.        
	We have searched the entire flat but the phones could not be found. We have asked the service providers for call details of the four cellphones, the officer added.        
	The husband of the 38-year-old whom Sujit had named in the suicide note said his wife was not in any way responsible for the tragedy. My wife is on friendly terms with all our neighbours as she is a member of the governing committee of our estate. She was close to Pinki, too, said the husband, an NRI.

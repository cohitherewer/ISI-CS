                      Novel inspiration                    With more than 170 books to her credit, Jnanpith award winner Ashapurna Devi was known for her stories of simple folks with whom readers could easily relate. Though she depicted the mundane lives of common women in their ordinary surroundings, yet she was by no means a simple teller of womens tales. Beneath her straightforward narration of everyday life can be found subtle layers of experience that cover the lives of women over generations. Her stories trace the changes and contradictions between rural and urban milieu, revealing the inner conflict in women as they seek to break free of the traditional roles assigned to them by a rigid, patriarchal society. To commemorate the late authors birth centenary, 26 well-known artists have come together at the ongoing exhibition to showcase creations inspired by her writings. The challenge for the artists was to delve through the linear interpretation of her novels and seek out their inner truth, at the same time building myths out of a literary narrative.                    Event: An exhibition of paintings and sculptures on Ashapurna Devis novels When: Till February 1; 2 pm - 8 pm Where: Samokal Art Gallery, 23 Gariahat Road, Gol Park

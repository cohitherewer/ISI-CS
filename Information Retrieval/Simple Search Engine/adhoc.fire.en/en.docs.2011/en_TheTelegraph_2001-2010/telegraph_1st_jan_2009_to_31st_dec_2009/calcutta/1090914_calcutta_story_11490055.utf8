The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Visitor food ban   in zoo
                                                                                                               Visitor food ban   in zoo
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Outside food will not be allowed inside Alipore zoo from next month to protect the animals and keep the premises clean.        
	Visitors will not be allowed to enter the zoo with food from October 1. They leave behind leftovers and even tend to feed animals, which is strictly prohibited, Raju Das, the zoo director, told Metro.         
	The move is also aimed at restricting the entry of plastic bags into the zoo. Visitors litter the premises with plastic packets. People will, however, be allowed to carry infant food and water bottles into the zoo, he added.         
	According to him, outside food is banned in every other zoo in the world.        
	Visitors to the city zoo often throw food items, especially fruits, at animals, disturbing them. Notices asking them not to do so have proved ineffective.        
	The zoo authorities have also asked the owners of restaurants inside the zoo to replace plastic bags with paper packets. They will also not be allowed to serve beverages in plastic cups, said an official.         
	The director said the zoo authorities were trying to provide safe drinking water to all visitors. Once we manage to do that, even water bottles will be banned inside the zoo, said Das.        
	Mishap: Ram Bahadur Chhetri, a resident of Posta in his mid-30s, was seriously injured after being knocked down by a private car on KK Tagore Street on Saturday night.                    
	Cops said Chhetri was crossing the road when the vehicle dashed him. Chhetri was rushed to a local nursing home, where he was admitted with fractures in his right foot. Cops arrested the driver and impounded the car.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Desi beats rule festive floor
                                                                                                               Desi beats rule festive floor
          POULOMI BANERJEE                          The Chiggy Wiggy number from Blue by Kylie Minogue                                  
	Theres no fun without desipan, preens Kareena in the ad of a snack brand. And Calcutta concurs.         
	DJs across town say Bollywood beats are ruling the consoles at dandiyas, private parties and nightclubs this festive season. Hindi film tracks are a must this Saturday because its Diwali and people will dress ethnic, said DJ Girish of Shisha.         
	Right from Durga puja, I have been playing more of Bollywood  the Kaminey superhit track Dhan te nan and numbers from Love Aaj Kal and Dil Bole Hadippa! are still going strong, now joined by Wake Up Sid and the soon-to-be released Tum Mile, he said.         
	DJ Harish of Dublin voted for Kylie Minogues Chiggy Wiggy from the Diwali release Blue. Agreed Girish. This track is very popular, especially among the ladies, he said, adding that he also played retro and Michael Jackson for the Bengali crowd during Puja.         
	The reason, he said, was the festive mood of the party crowd. During festivals, a lot of people come out to party who otherwise dont. They want more of Bollywood.         
	The scene was the same at Venom. The 30-plus crowd prefers Bollywood, though the youngsters want international tracks. To strike a balance, we are playing 40 per cent Bolly now, up from the usual 10-15 per cent, said DJ Kunal of Venom. I am getting a lot of requests for Chiggy Wiggy.... Diwali will definitely be about Bolly numbers , he added.        
	The DJ said his trump card was Dhol, an exclusive track that was very popular with his patrons. We play it for all the festivals and get a lot of requests for it too, he smiled.        
	Desi found favour at Tantra too. We played more of Bollywood on the Puja nights and also brought guest DJs specialising in Bollywood beats, said DJ Vishal of Tantra.         
	But desi is not just Bolly this season. If Bengalis took pains to don the dhoti and sari on Puja, they wanted Bengali music to jive too. I played Sadher lau and Pagla hawa from Bong Connection during the Puja weekend because I got requests for them, laughed Girish.         
	Harish, who also plays at private parties, agreed. Sadher lau, Barandaye roddur and Telephone are regulars among the young crowd, he said, but rued the lack of fresh Bengali tracks.

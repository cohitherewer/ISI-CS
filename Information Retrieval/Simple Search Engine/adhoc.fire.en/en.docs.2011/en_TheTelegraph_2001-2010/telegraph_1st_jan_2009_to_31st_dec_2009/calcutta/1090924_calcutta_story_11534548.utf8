The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Blackmail manager held
                                                                                                               Blackmail manager held
  - Victim goes to cops after videos and pictures pop up on porn sites          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A 42-year-old senior manager with an IT company has been arrested for allegedly blackmailing a Salt Lake woman with private pictures and videos uploaded to pornographic websites.        
	Swapan Jhawars arrest comes a week after a Mumbai businessman was nabbed for blackmailing sitar player Anoushka Shankar, the daughter of maestro Ravi Shankar, with some photographs stolen from her email account.        
	Police said Jhawar, who is married and has a 12-year-old son, had been blackmailing the woman into continuing their extra-marital relationship.         
	The victim, who is in her early thirties, lodged a complaint with Bidhannagar North police station on Tuesday.         
	We immediately contacted Gariahat police station, which helped us arrest him from his south Calcutta residence. It takes guts for a woman to lodge a complaint by putting her reputation at stake, and we applaud the victim for doing so, said Debabrata Das, the additional superintendent of police, Bidhannagar.        
	Jhawar was produced in the court of the Salt Lake additional chief judicial magistrate on Wednesday and remanded in police custody for three days.        
	According to investigators, he had met the woman during an official meeting earlier this year and entered into a relationship with her.         
	Apart from taking embarrassing photographs of her, he used a hidden camera to film her when they secretly met at his Gariahat residence whenever his family was away, an officer said.         
	Jhawar has been booked under as many as nine sections of the IPC and Information Technology Act. The charges against him include extortion by putting a person in fear of death or grievous hurt; criminal intimidation; defamation; words, gestures and acts intended to insult the modesty of a woman; and publishing pornographic material on the Internet.        
	The victim said in her complaint that Jhawar started blackmailing her after she decided to stop seeing him.         
	The accused immediately emailed her links to the pornographic sites where he had uploaded her pictures and the videos shot with a hidden camera. He threatened to upload her private pictures and video clips on several other sites if she stopped meeting him, the officer said.        
	Jhawars family was unavailable for comment. The identity of the complainant is being withheld.

                                                                                                               Kin struggle with poll loss
          OUR BUREAU                          Jainul Mollahs mother Somajan. (Sanat Kr Sinha)                                  
	The CPM leader who was killed in election violence on Wednesday was the primary earning member of a family of seven. The teenaged Trinamul supporter who met with a similar end has left behind a pregnant wife.        
	Jainul Mollah was a panchayat member of Narayanapur (West) in Canning for several years. He supported his mother, wife and five sons with his income from farming and odd jobs. The couples two daughters are married.        
	Jainuls 50-year-old widow Sabiran Bibi is worried about how they would make ends meet.         
	I dont know how I will run the family. The sons are not interested in agriculture and have a meagre income. My husband was always busy with the work the party gave him and did not bother about savings, she said.        
	Jainuls 75-year-old mother Somajan was hit on the right cheek by splinters of the bomb that killed his son. I implored them to spare my son but to no avail. I fell on the ground after I was injured and became senseless. They killed him in front of me and I could do nothing, Somajan kept saying on Thursday.        
	Jainuls eldest son Momin Mollah said the attackers were Trinamul supporters from the area and were absconding. Eight people have been arrested in connection with the murder.        
	In Baganpara at Baligori in Rajarhat, hundreds of people attended the last rites of 17-year-old Khijir Ali Molla.        
	Khijirs parents are concerned about his 16-year-old pregnant wife Arjina Biwi.        
	She has been crying all day and has fainted several times, said Khijirs father Wahidul.        
	His wife Adari Biwi, 55, kept asking people on Thursday why her son was killed.        
	Khijir and two of his friends were attacked when they stepped out of his house hearing the sound of bombs in the locality.

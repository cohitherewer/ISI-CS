The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Ford in expansion drive
                                                                                                               Ford in expansion drive

	Ford India is ramping up its dealership network in the city ahead of the launch of its small car, scheduled early next year. The company, which has a dealership in Topsia, will open a second outlet in the city next month. This was disclosed by Michael Boneham, the president and managing director of Ford India, at the panel discussion on Presenting American Investor Interest: Positioning West Bengal held recently at a city hotel.        
	Boneham, who was here to talk about his investment experience in Tamil Nadu where the company has a Maraimalai Nagar plant near Chennai, said: We are majorly revamping our sales and service centres before we get into the volumes segment. We will have four dealerships in the state, to cater to what we expect a huge demand.        
	Ford has dealerships in Durgapur and Siliguri. The company will strengthen its sales and service centres to 153 from the current 90 countrywide.         
	The American company, which sold 600 units in Calcutta last year, has done 300 units till June this year. The figure is expected to significantly increase next year after the Ford hatch is launched. Small cars account for 70 per cent of the market and we plan to have a fair share of it with our new global model, said Boneham.         
	The car with a sub 1.2 litre petrol engine and a sub 1.5 litre diesel engine will have 85 per cent local components that will help keep the price competitive, he added. While we cannot have 100 per cent localised components for the car because Electronic Control Modules and others still need to be imported, we are slowly working towards that.        
	According to sources, the hatch is expected to shore up Fords fortunes in India to about 100,000 units a year. The company sold 30,000 units nationally last year and is looking to do the same figure this year too. The new hatch will be exported to Asean countries, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.        
	Fords engine plant, which produces 60,000 units, will be ramped up to produce 2,50,000 units by the first quarter of next year and will turn into a sourcing hub for engines. We are also looking to produce more and more low displacement, high performance engines, said Boneham.

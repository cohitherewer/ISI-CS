          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Three youths who were sentenced to life by the city sessions court for the kidnap and murder of a Vivekananda Road trader were acquitted by the high court on Friday.         
	The prosecution has failed to prove the guilt of the accused, stated the division bench headed by Justice P.K. Chattopadhyay before setting aside the judgment passed by the sessions court.        
	The prosecutor told the court that Nizer Akkar, Raju Dutta and Sukhbir Singh had kidnapped Kishore Herwat from his residence on October 10, 2000, and demanded a ransom of Rs 3 lakh from his family members.        
	Around midnight the same day, the police found the traders body in a bush near the EM Bypass.        
	The cops arrested the trio, who were aged between 25 and 30 years, in November that year.         
	The trial started before the chief judge of the city sessions court in January 2001. In mid-2006, the court pronounced the three guilty and sentenced them to life.        
	During his stay in jail, Akkar, now 34, played Valmiki in Rabindranath Tagores Valmiki Prativa, directed by Alokananda Roy. The dance drama, with inmates in the cast, was staged by the state jail department in various parts of Bengal.        
	Akkar performed his role extremely well. Many directors have met him in jail and expressed their desire to cast him in their plays after he was released from jail, Jayanta Narayan Chatterjee, the lawyer representing the state government, told the court.        
	The high courts order was sent to Alipore Central jail, where the trio are lodged. They are likely to be released on Saturday.

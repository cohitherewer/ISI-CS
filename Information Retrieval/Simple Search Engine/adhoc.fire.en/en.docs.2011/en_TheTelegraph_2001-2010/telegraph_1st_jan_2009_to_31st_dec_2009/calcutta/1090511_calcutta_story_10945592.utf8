The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Teen drowns in bid to beat heat
                                                                                                               Teen drowns in bid to beat heat
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Abhishek Agarwal (Gopal Senapati)                                  
	A 14-year-old boy who could not swim but still jumped into the Hooghly to beat the heat drowned near Ramakrishnapur Ghat in Howrah on Sunday afternoon.         
	Abhishek Agarwal lived in Bon Behari Bose Lane and studied in Class IX in a local school. He along with three of his friends from the locality dove in around 1.30pm.        
	The other boys, too, could not swim. Two of them were rescued by a rickshaw-puller while one made it to the shore by himself.        
	Siraj Mohammad, one of the boys who had accompanied Abhishek, said: Since we cannot swim, we dont take a dip in the river. Today we could not stand the heat and decided to enter the water. We were near the shore but did not realise the high tide had started.        
	Residents fished out the body around 3.30pm. Abhisheks father Surender, a trader, and mother Nisha were at their ancestral home in Bihar.

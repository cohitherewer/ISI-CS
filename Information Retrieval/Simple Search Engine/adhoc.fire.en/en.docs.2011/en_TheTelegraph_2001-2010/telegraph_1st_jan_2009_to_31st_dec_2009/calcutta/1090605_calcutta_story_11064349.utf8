The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | More seats in colleges
                                                                                                               More seats in colleges
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The state higher education council on Thursday asked the vice-chancellors of the Bengal universities to prepare to increase seats in the most popular undergraduate courses, infrastructure permitting.        
	Each college will be asked to determine the subjects most in demand and seek permission from its affiliating university to increase student intake provided it has the adequate infrastructure. The seats can be increased up to 10 per cent, said a senior council official after a meeting with the vice-chancellors and senior officials of various universities.        
	The move has been prompted by the rise in the number of successful candidates in the Plus-II examinations.

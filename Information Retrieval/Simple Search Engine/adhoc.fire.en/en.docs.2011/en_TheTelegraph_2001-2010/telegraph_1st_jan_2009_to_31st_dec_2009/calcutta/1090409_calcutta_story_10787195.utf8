The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Security revamp for museum 
                                                                                                               Security revamp for museum

	The authorities of Indian Museum are planning a slew of measures to revamp security at the heritage building, which will turn 200 in 2014.        
	We have a number of plans for the bi-centenary of the museum, including overhauling the security set-up, said Kishor K. Basa, the director of Indian Museum.        
	The authorities are planning to upgrade the galleries and restructure the lighting and display systems. Only after the upgrade is through, we will get a clearer picture about the security requirements, Basa added.        
	At present, the museum has a number of layers of security jointly manned by museum security staff, Calcutta police and private guards. There are also 119 closed-circuit television cameras on the premises.        
	The average daily footfall at the museum is around 1,700. There are 35 galleries, of which 22 are operational.        
	Talks are on with the Centre about the deployment of CISF personnel on the museum premises. We want the central force to man the museum right from the entrance to the last gate, Basa said.        
	The number of CCTVs, too, will be increased. We will decide on the exact figures after the galleries are upgraded. A committee has been formed to draw up a revamp plan for the galleries, he said.        
	Sources said the museum was planning to introduce intelligent surveillance system instead of the present electronic surveillance system, which has a few drawbacks. Though there is round-the-clock surveillance, the system does not facilitate instant reaction to a crisis, said a museum official.        
	The intelligence surveillance system not only records images and incidents, but also sends out alerts to persons concerned during an emergency. If a fire breaks out or there is an intrusion, the new system will immediately send a call to the cellphone of the designated securityman, the official explained.

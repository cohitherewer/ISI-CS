                                                                                                               Girl, man killed in twin mishaps
          A STAFF REPORTER                       Sanchayita Sardar                          
	A 12-year-old girl and a man were killed in two accidents in Howrah on Sunday.         
	Sanchayita Sardar, a Class V student, was run over by a speeding truck moments after she got off a bus on the busy Andul Road around 11.30am.         
	She was taken to a nursing home in the locality where she was declared dead on arrival.         
	Police said Sanchayita was returning home on a private bus from her dance tuition at Argari.         
	She got off the bus at Deullipara, a five-minute walk from her home. A truck from the opposite direction mowed her down while she was trying to cross the road, said an officer of Sankrail police station.         
	Father Raghunath Sardar, a garments trader, said Sanchayita had been going to the dance tuition for the past two years.         
	Every Sunday, she used to attend the class from 10 am till noon. Today she was returning early as the class was cancelled, said Sardar.         
	The truck fled the spot after the mishap but the driver was later arrested.        
	A case under Section 304A (causing death by negligence) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered against him, said the officer.         
	Residents blocked Andul Road for an hour, demanding better policing and immediate setting up of speed-breakers.         
	Accidents occur almost daily on the stretch. But no policeman is posted despite several pleas, said Shibnath Porui, a local resident.         
	The protesters dispersed after the police arrived and traffic movement became normal around 1pm.         
	In the other mishap, on Foreshore Road in the afternoon, a 32-year-old man bled to death when the motorcycle he was riding crashed into a truck and his head banged against iron rods it was carrying.         
	The police said Bakhtiyar Alam, a resident of Shibpur, was riding the two-wheeler without wearing a helmet.         
	Alam, who drives cars, was taken to Howrah District Hospital, where a doctor declared him dead on arrival.         
	The iron rods were jutting out of the truck. Alams head hit the rods when the truck driver suddenly slammed the brakes. He was bleeding profusely from the head while he was being carried to the hospital, said an officer of Shibpur police station.         
	The driver tried to flee but residents caught hold of him and handed him over to the police.

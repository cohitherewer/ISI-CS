	A high court judge on Wednesday decided to watch the Bengali film Poran Jai Joliya Re to verify whether it was a copy of Namastey London as alleged by its maker Vipul Shah.        
	Shah had moved court on Tuesday accusing the Calcutta-based Shree Venkatesh Films of copying frame-by-frame from his 2007 release starring Akshay Kumar and Katrina Kaif.         
	Shahs advocate Ranjan Bachwat urged the court to pass an order to stop the screening of Poran Jai. The Bengali film, starring Dev and Subhashree, is on its second week at 115 halls in the state.        
	The plot, theme, sequence of events, dialogues and characters of Poran Jai are similar to Namastey London, which means it is an infringement of the Copyright Act, 1957, said Bachwat.         
	Advocate Anindya Mitra, appearing for Shree Venkatesh Films, replied: The case has been moved under the Copyright Act but taking ideas from a particular film does not fall under the purview of this Act. Besides, the story and the sequence of events of the two films are not similar. Bachwat argued that though obtaining of ideas did not come under Copyright Act, the expression of ideas did.         
	After hearing both parties, Justice Nadira Patheriya asked Shree Venkatesh Films to arrange a screening of Poran Jai and inform the court of the venue and time. of screening on Thursday.

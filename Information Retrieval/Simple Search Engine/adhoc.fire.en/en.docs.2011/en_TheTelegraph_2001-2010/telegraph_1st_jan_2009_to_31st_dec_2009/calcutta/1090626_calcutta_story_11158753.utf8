The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | State frowns on plan to scrap board exam 
                                                                                                               State frowns on plan to scrap board exam 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                      (Top) Kapil Sibal and Partha De      
	The state government on Thursday rejected the Centres proposal of making the Class X board examination optional to reduce stress on students.        
	The Bengal government is also against the Centres plan to have only a single school board at the national level.        
	The measures suggested by the Centre are aimed at curbing the powers of the state government in the field of school education. We will strongly oppose the proposals, said state school education minister Partha De.        
	He countered the claim that scrapping the current system of multiple boards holding Class X exams would reduce stress on students.        
	The state government has introduced a number of schemes to reduce trauma and make examinations student-friendly. We are still working to make examinations more stress-free, said De.        
	Human resource development minister Kapil Sibal recently announced in Delhi that the Centre wanted to make Class X board examination optional for students wanting to continue in the same school. According to the plan, if a student wants to study Plus-II in another school, he or she may appear in the Class X exams conducted by a national board. Otherwise, the student can be promoted to Class XI after internal assessment.        
	De claimed the measures were aimed at privatising school education.        
	There will be disparities in assessment if such a policy is implemented. It is not possible for all schools to maintain a uniform assessment pattern. Only those studying in well-known private schools will reap the benefits of the system, added the minister.

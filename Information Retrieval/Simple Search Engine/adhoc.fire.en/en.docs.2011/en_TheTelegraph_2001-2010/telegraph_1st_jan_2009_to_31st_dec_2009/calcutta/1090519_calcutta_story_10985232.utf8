The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Dumped patient dies unattended 
                                                                                                               Dumped patient dies unattended 
          SANJAY MANDAL                                        Metro report on the two men who are now recovering   at a private hospital    
	A critical patient apparently dumped by family members at Medical College and Hospital on Sunday afternoon died unattended hours later.        
	The unidentified man, in his 50s, was found lying on a trolley in the emergency ward around 2am. He was unable to speak and his condition was critical. He was gasping, said Pranab Mukherjee, the social welfare officer of the hospital.        
	Being a Sunday, there was no senior doctor in the emergency ward. The interns were requested to provide some supportive treatment to the patient, like putting him on oxygen, but they did not do anything, he alleged.        
	Around 7.30pm, more than five hours after the man was spotted in the ward, a senior doctor examined him and found him dead. The body was handed over to police, said Mukherjee.        
	Metro has reported about the plight of two similar patients who were lucky enough to have found shelter in a private hospital after lying naked and unattended for more than five days at Medical College.        
	Officials of the Mission of Mercy Hospital, on Park Street, said the condition of the unidentified duo had improved. One of them ate semi-solid food today, said Sanjay Prasad, the chief executive officer of the hospital.        
	Anup Roy, the superintendent of Medical College, blamed Group D employees and the shortage of medical staff for the inability to attend to patients who were dumped by their families. These patients need supportive therapy but Group D employees are not ready to clean or feed them.        
	Does the hospital have any plan for such patients? The problem is social rather than medical. Several patients are dumped by relatives near the hospital. Local residents then bring them here.... There is also the problem of rehabilitation. At least 20 aged patients who have recovered are still occupying our beds as old-age homes are unwilling to take them in, said Roy.

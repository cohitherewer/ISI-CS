The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Differing versions on murder
                                                                                                               Differing versions on murder
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Pintu Paul, the prime accused in the murder of beautician Gauri Bagal, has given contradictory statements, an investigating officer said.        
	While recalling the March 11 murder, Pintu told us that Gauri had taken ill near Santragachhi station. But we later learnt that on the day of the murder, Pintu had told one of Gauris friends that she had fallen ill near Lake Land Country Club, said an officer.        
	Residents of Howrahs Garfa Sitalatala spotted a limp Gauri wedged between two youths  Pintu and Potla  on a motorcycle.        
	The duo took the woman to a house in the locality. Alerted by local residents, police raided the house and took Gauri to hospital where she was declared dead.        
	Pintu told the cops that Gauri, a patient of gastric ulcer, had vomited and passed out before falling off the motorcycle. He claimed that the woman had suffered fatal head injuries during the fall.        
	But Gauris family members claimed that she was fit in the afternoon.        
	We are awaiting the viscera report which will throw light on the case, said the officer, adding that the sleuths were trying to find out the motive behind the murder.        
	Potla is yet to be arrested. We think the police are going slow on the probe, said Gauris elder brother Gopal.        
	The day Gauris body was found, Potla called up Pintu. The cops could have tracked him down using Pintus cellphone, he added.

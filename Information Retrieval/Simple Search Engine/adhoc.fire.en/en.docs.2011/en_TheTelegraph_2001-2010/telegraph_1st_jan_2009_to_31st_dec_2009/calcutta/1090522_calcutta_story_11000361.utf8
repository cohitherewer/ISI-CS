The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | NSG security plan for Metro
                                                                                                               NSG security plan for Metro

	The National Security Guard (NSG) has drawn up a blueprint for protecting Metro Railway, which experts have identified as a potential soft target for terrorists.        
	The standard operating procedure, drawn up by the elite anti-terror force in the country with inputs from the Intelligence Branch, city police and railway advisers, envisages a multi-tier security ring in and around Metro stations.        
	The operating procedure specifies the roles of senior officers, detective department and the city polices special branch in making Metro secure. The plan tries to make those on duty accountable, said a senior security officer of Eastern Railway, who has received a copy of the document. The operating procedure sets a security protocol not just for emergencies but also during normal services.        
	The disaster management plan developed by the NSG takes into account possibility of terror attacks and hijacking of trains. The role of health and fire services and the state-level disaster management authority in such situations have also been specified, said Jayanta Kumar Mitra, the chief operating manager of Metro Railway.        
	After 26/11, the home ministry asked the NSG to prepare a security plan for Metro Railway with the help of inputs from security agencies. An NSG team recently visited the city in this connection.        
	We took a close look at the Metro security arrangements during our visit and collected inputs from various agencies. We took into account the chinks in the system before developing a fool-proof blueprint for Metro security, said A.K. Gupta, the inspector-general (operations) of the NSG.

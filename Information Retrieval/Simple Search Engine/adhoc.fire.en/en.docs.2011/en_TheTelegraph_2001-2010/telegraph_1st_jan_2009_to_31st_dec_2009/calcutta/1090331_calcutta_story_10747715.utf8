The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Meter check PIL by taxi lobby
                                                                                                               Meter check PIL by taxi lobby
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          A taxi meter being tampered with. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Three taxi owners and drivers associations have challenged the transport departments authority to get check taxi meters checked by a private agency against a fee, twice a year.        
	Admitting the petition, Justice J. Biswas of the high court on Monday gave the state two days to clarify whether the transport department was empowered to order such checks on taxis plying in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area.        
	The petitioners, citing a department notification issued on February 18, submitted that only the public vehicles directorate could check the meters and issue certificates twice a year against a fee of Rs 300 each time.        
	But in reality, a private organisation  Bhagwandas and Company  has been entrusted with checking meters and issuing certificates, Arunava Ghosh, the petitioners lawyer, told the court.        
	Ghosh claimed that the Motor Vehicles Rules did not have any provision for checking taxi meters against a fee. He also alleged that Bhagwandas owned a company that manufactured taxi meters. How can a company that manufactures taxi meters be allowed to check meters? Ghosh asked in court.        
	The petitioners claimed that the transport department had stated in the notification that the process of checking meters was finalised abiding by Rule 265 of the Motor Vehicles Act, which was in turn based on Rule 264 of the act. Rule 264, the state claims, empowers the department to check taxi meters.        
	But the transport department, through another notification in 2003, had struck down Rule 264. How can a rule that is made on the basis of a non-existent rule be valid? asked a lawyer assisting Ghosh.        
	Manirujamman, the state lawyer, said his senior colleague had sought instructions from the transport department to make a submission in court. The judge asked the state lawyer to come on Wednesday.        
	The three petitioner associations are  the Calcutta Taxi Association, Progressive Taxi Owners Association and the Calcutta Metropolitan Taxi Drivers Association.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Five schoolgirls went missing on Tuesday morning while walking to their tuition classes from their homes in Bally, Howrah.         
	According to police, Durgapur Pallimangal School students Amrita Rang, 14, Juin Halder, 13, Tuktuki Chakraborty, 12, Suparna Das, 14, and Shamima Khatun, 13, left their houses around 6am. Their guardians called the tutor around 10.45am and were told they had not turned up.         
	The relatives lodged police complaints in the afternoon. Suparna was carrying a cellphone. When her father Amar called the number, she picked up but a male voice rudely asked her to switch off the phone. The phone was switched off after that.         
	The police said they were investigating all possible angles.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Chowringhee in London
                                                                                                               Chowringhee in London
										      caleidoscope                         The cover of the hardbound edition				                           
	Indian English writing is celebrated abroad. Some would say much of it is written for those abroad. But writing in Indian regional languages? Perhaps even Sankar never thought his Sata Bose and Marco Polo would find readers 40 years later in far western shores. But then such is the appeal of the goings-on at Shah Jahan Hotel in Sankars Sixties potboiler Chowringhee.         
	After being translated into a dozen Indian languages and sold in thousands in the country and made into a blockbuster film, the novel has now found a new readership in London.         
	The British and Commonwealth hardbound edition of the English translation of Chowringhee published by Atlantic Books of England was released on the eve of London Book Fair held between April 20 and 23.        
	Among all Indian heavyweight writers, including Vikram Seth, Amartya Sen, Amit Chaudhuri, Suketu Mehta and Amitav Ghosh, it was the 75-plus Bengali novelist from Bongaon-Howrah-Calcutta Mani Shankar Mukherjee, alias Sankar, who stole the show at the three-day fair.         
	From The Guardian, which listed Chowringhee as the book of the week, to The Independent, where Boyd Tonkin hails it as an utter treat, the novel and its author received a rousing welcome.         
	There were many listeners at Sankars lectures, of which one was at the British Library where he talked on cities in literature and why he wrote only about Calcutta.         
	My father shifted to Howrah, where I grew up and came to be called a Bangal. My friends pointed out at least 200 dilapidated buildings as high court to me (a common Bengali joke points out the high court to the Bangal, someone from the former East Bengal). The only revenge that I could take was to write about the court later.         
	This was his much-acclaimed Koto Ajanare, based on his first employer Noel Barwell, the last British barrister, who also initiated him into the corporate world of Calcutta.         
	Sankars revenge on his friends and critics who hailed him back then as an illiterate who has taken to writing has been sweet.         
	Today he is relaxed and enjoys the fruits of jobs well done. As an acclaimed author.       ANASUYA BASU

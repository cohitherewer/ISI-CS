The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Scan on SMS clue in murder
                                                                                                               Scan on SMS clue in murder
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The threat message on murdered schoolgirl Bithi Roys cellphone that led to the arrest of four boys was prompted by a prank, according to one of their common friends.        
	Madhumita Naskar said her boyfriend Sanjay Adak, one of the accused, was repeatedly trying to call her up on March 31.        
	I had asked Bithi to take the call and tell him that I was not around. He sent her the message after she did that, Madhumita, a 16-year-old student of Aryabani Girls High School, told Metro.        
	Bithi was last spotted with Madhumita and two of their friends, Priyanka Mondal and Srabonti Naskar, on Tuesday evening. The body was found near Kona station on Wednesday morning.        
	Residents of Kona Shitalatala have also questioned the significance of the SMS.        
	Police havent found the murder weapon and are not even sure about the place of the crime. It seems the cops are framing the boys to avoid a political turmoil before the elections, said Ratan Das, a resident.        
	The post-mortem report stated that Bithi was raped and murdered. Then why have the police charged the boys only with murder? asked a lawyer representing the boys.        
	Niraj Kumar Singh, the superintendent of police, Howrah, refused comment.        
	The police had earlier claimed that the four boys had confessed to the murder.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Nip n tuck at Singur home for Nano
                                                                                                               Nip n tuck at Singur home for Nano
          ANASUYA BASU                          Snehasish Bhattacharya                                  
	The first thing Snehasish Bhattacharya did after receiving a text message from Tata Motors was sign up for driving lessons. The resident of the stillborn Nano factory site, Singur, is among the chosen 1 lakh applicants in the country to be allotted the car.        
	I was caught unawares by the message, smiled the soon-to-be first-generation four-wheeler owner.        
	His three-storey house at Satmandirtala will need some alterations to welcome the Nano though. The entrance will have to be widened and a garage built, said the state government employee.        
	I had booked a Nano because of its Rs 1 lakh price tag, which made the car accessible to people like us, said the 44-year-old father of two. I needed a car to take my ailing 80-year-old mother to hospital every now and then. A hired car costs me between Rs 400 and Rs 500 a day. The Nano will be economical for me.        
	But Bhattacharya is peeved at the price. I booked a red colour standard model believing that I would pay Rs 1 lakh. But now I find the ex-showroom price is Rs 1,30,784. And with insurance and registration, the on-road price has jumped to Rs 1,49,398.        
	Bhattacharya, who is awaiting his loan approval from the Singur branch of the Central Bank of India, will have to pay an instalment of Rs 2,250 for 84 months.        
	When told that his BS III-compliant Nano would cost Rs 1 lakh at the factory gate, he said: Yes, if the factory had been here, we would have got the car for Rs 1 lakh.         
	Dilip Chatterjee, the branch manager of the Central Bank of India, said Bhattacharya would receive his allotment by July-end and his loan would be sanctioned after he submitted the requisite documents. Another applicant from Singur was allotted the Nano too, but he is foregoing it as he cant pay the security deposit, he added.         
	Though Bhattacharya hasnt seen the standard Nano model, he had checked out the LX model at Lexus Motors, where he booked his car. I found the car quite spacious, he said.         
	His son Rocket was excited at the Nanos imminent arrival. I wont have to take the bus to my mamar badi (maternal uncles home) anymore, grinned the 14-year-old.        
	His fathers 125cc Bajaj Discovery could barely hold his parents and kid sister and Rocket would end up taking the bus. Now, Ratan Tatas dream of putting the two-wheeler family inside a car will bring the Bhattacharyas together on four wheels.

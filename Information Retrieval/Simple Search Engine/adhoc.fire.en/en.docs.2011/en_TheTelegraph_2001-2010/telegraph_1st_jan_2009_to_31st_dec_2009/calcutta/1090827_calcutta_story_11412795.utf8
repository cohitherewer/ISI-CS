                                                                                                               Court boost for scan on private tribunal
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti                                  
	The high court on Wednesday dismissed a petition by a city-based NGO to stop police from investigating the activities of a tribunal it runs.        
	Kirity Roy, the secretary of Manabadhikar Suraksha Mancha (Masum), told the court that the police had no right to conduct an inquiry into the activities of the Peoples Tribunal on Torture, which his organisation ran to protect human rights.        
	Suman Ghosh, who appeared for the police, submitted a report on the activities of the tribunal and a progress report on the investigation by the detective department.         
	The report said the tribunal, which operates from SN Banerjee Road, had recently written to police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti asking him to appear before it or send a representative to state the police version on a particular case.        
	After receiving the letter, the deputy commissioner of the detective department wrote back to Roy, the secretary of the NGO, to furnish documents relating to the functioning of the tribunal, Ghosh told the court.        
	The lawyer said the police had found that prominent people  such as Malay Sengupta, a former chief justice of Sikkim  were on the tribunals jury.        
	The police then lodged a complaint against the tribunal. Armed with a search warrant, the cops raided the NGOs office in Howrah and seized some documents.        
	The document showed the organisation had received funds from a foreign organisation called European Union and Fredrick Nueman Stiffung. The money was being routed through the foreign organisations unit in Madurai, called Peoples Watch, Ghosh told the court.         
	He also claimed that the papers submitted by Roy to the police were fake.

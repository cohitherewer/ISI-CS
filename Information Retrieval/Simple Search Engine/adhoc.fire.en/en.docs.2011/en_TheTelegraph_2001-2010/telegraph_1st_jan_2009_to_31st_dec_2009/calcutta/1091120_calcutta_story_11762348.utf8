                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Entrance test after admission for PhD students
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Nearly 300 students who had enrolled for PhD at Calcutta University (CU) between July 11 and August 7 will have to qualify in an admission test to continue their doctoral studies.         
	The new PhD regulations drawn up by the University Grants Commission were announced on July 11 but were not implemented before August 7 as the circular did not reach the university.         
	Students rushed to enrol for doctoral programmes in July after the UGC made public its plans to overhaul PhD regulations and put in place one set of norms across the country.        
	The introduction of entrance tests is one of the changes made by the UGC.        
	That students who enrolled for PhD at CU under old regulations after July 11 would also have to sit for the tests was decided at a syndicate meeting on Thursday.         
	The students will have to qualify in the entrance exam to complete their doctoral programmes, said Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee, the CU pro vice-chancellor (academic). The tests are likely to be held next month.        
	The UGC had made it clear that the revised regulations would come into effect at the universities from July 11, the day the gazette notification was issued.         
	Unaware of the notification, the CU authorities continued to admit students for PhD under old regulations till August 7, when the UGC uploaded the revised guidelines on its website.        
	The university later contacted the UGC to find out how the registrations of those who enrolled between July 11 and August 7 could be regularised.        
	The admission test is the only way we can regularise the students, said a syndicate member on Thursday.        
	The registration of those who do not clear the test will be cancelled and the authorities will refund his/her registration fees.        
	According to the new UGC regulations, the entrance tests will be followed by an interview in which the candidates will have to discuss their proposed areas of research.        
	The faculty councils of CU have restructured the PhD norms in tune with the new UGC regulations. The faculty councils decisions were ratified by the syndicate on Thursday. The university also decided to offer only two-year MPhil programmes to students. Under the old norms, some MPhil courses were of a year.

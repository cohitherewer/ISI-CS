The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Five wanted for arms haul
                                                                                                               Five wanted for arms haul
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Police are looking for five criminals in connection with the arms haul at Thakurdari in New Towns Action Area II on Sunday morning.         
	Ajit Naskar, behind whose single-storeyed house 18 guns, over 1,600 bullets and material for making crude bombs were unearthed, is not one of the suspects, said an officer. The 52-year-old was released on Monday.        
	According to investigators, Ajits son Samar, who is absconding, was ferrying the arms and ammunition for the five, believed to be members of an arms racket.         
	The cops had said that the seized bullets bore the marks of ordnance factories in Pune and Kanpur but did not verify their findings with the authorities concerned.         
	The police have not asked us to check whether we manufactured the bullets. It is impossible for the ammunition to be smuggled out of the factories, said a senior official of the Ordnance Factory Board.        
	We sell bullets of certain bores to the public through a network of dealers. Each of our products carries a unique code, so we can say from our records to whom it was sold. If the police provide us the details of the seized ammunition, we can help them trace the dealer who sold the bullets to people without arms licences, added the ordnance board official.        
	If the ammunition were meant for the armed and paramilitary forces, a probe would be needed to find out how they reached criminals, felt the official.

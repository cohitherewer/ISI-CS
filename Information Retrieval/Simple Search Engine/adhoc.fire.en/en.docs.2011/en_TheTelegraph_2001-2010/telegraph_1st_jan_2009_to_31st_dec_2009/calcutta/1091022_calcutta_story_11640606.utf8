	A 2,500km voyage down the Ganga on inflatable boats by a Swiss explorer and his team has culminated in a river tourism drive by the state government and the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).        
	Andy Leemann led 12 crew members from various countries who embarked on the journey at Gangotri, the source of the river, on September 14 and made their way to Calcutta on Monday, documenting climactic and ecological changes along the way.        
	There is great scope for soft tourism on the Ganga. By soft tourism, I dont mean thousands of people but small groups of travellers who can be taken downstream to see nature at its best. Plus, there are river dolphins, rare species of turtles and birds, which we saw, said Leemann.        
	The 55-year-old stressed the need to encourage river tourism and highlighted its potential benefits for those who live along the banks.        
	More such tours will be undertaken if the CII has its way. The Ganga passes through only three states  West Bengal, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. The CII and the Centre have great plans for tourism on the river. While Bihar has come on board, we are in talks with the UP authorities. Trade and investment is bound to follow. Foreign investors have shown great interest, said Manab Pal, the chairman of tourism for CII, eastern India.        
	On September 24, an MoU was signed between river cruise company Pandaw Cruises India and the state tourism department. The RV Bengal Pandaw, designed like a colonial river steamer, left Calcutta on September 28 on its maiden trip down the Ganga to Varanasi, touching Howrah, Hooghly, Nadia and Murshidabad.        
	The 1,280km tour will cost a tourist between Rs 1.2 lakh and Rs 1.8 lakh. Although it is expensive, we are booked for the next seven voyages, said Pal.        
	With former French colony Chandernagore, Nawab-ruled Murshidabad and Portuguese-influenced Bandel making great stops on river cruises in Bengal, this is one boat the tourism industry wont want to miss.

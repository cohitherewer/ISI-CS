	Indo-US ties, having been through a series of crests and troughs, could only get better, said Ronen Sen, Indias former ambassador to Washington.        
	Indo-US relations have gone through hot and cold phases during and after the Cold War. Contrary to popular belief, it had little to do with our tilt towards the Soviet Union during the Cold War, the former envoy said while delivering the Sarat Chandra Bose Memorial Lecture at Netaji Research Bureau on Wednesday.        
	The worst phases in the bilateral ties, Sen pointed out, were during the reign of Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter. But even after the Cold War ended, it took nearly a decade for India and the US to end their benign neglect of each other.        
	The crucial change in perspective came during the tenure of President George W. Bush, when the US started looking at India as an emerging global power. From the late 1990s, the US started viewing India irrespective of sub-regional contexts and without the prism of Pakistan. That was the key.... Pakistan was no longer considered an impediment to Indo-US relations.        
	With Barack Obama at the helm the ties would only get stronger, felt Sen. An increased trust in India is conspicuous in the US. The nuclear deal is a good example of that trust.        
	The former ambassador sought to allay fears that a closer engagement with the US would call for India to compromise on her sovereignty. Of course, there will be differences. But we have to carefully calibrate our position, defend our interests with the dignity befitting the worlds largest democracy....

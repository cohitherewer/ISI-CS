The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Strike pushes back exams
                                                                                                               Strike pushes back exams
  - Disruptions may also delay Calcutta University results           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Calcutta University has postponed all undergraduate and postgraduate examinations scheduled on Friday because of the transport strike.         
	More than 1.5 lakh examinees were to sit for nearly 40 university examinations, including BA and BSc Part II general (under 1+1+1 system) and business administration (honours) Part I, on Friday. Entrance tests for postgraduate courses have been pushed back, too.         
	Examinees coming from far-off places may not be able to reach the examination venues in time because most buses and minibuses will be off the road. We have no choice but to postpone the examinations, said a university official on Thursday evening.         
	The postponed BA and BSc (general) Part I (2+1 pattern) and Part II examinations will be held on August 10 along with the business administration (honours) Part I test.         
	The time and venue of the examinations remain unchanged.         
	We will announce the dates of the remaining postponed undergraduate and postgraduate examinations later, said Debashis Biswas, the deputy controller of examinations of Calcutta University.         
	The examination department had postponed all undergraduate and postgraduate exams slated for July 17 because of the bandh called by the Congress.         
	The examinations that were to be held on that day were rescheduled to August 8.         
	The university authorities warned of a delay in the announcement of results because of two postponements in a week.         
	Sudden bandhs and strikes are disrupting the examination schedule. The schedule for the entire year will go haywire if the transport strike continues for an indefinite period, said a teacher.         
	The delay is likely to have a ripple effect on the Llb examinations because centres for the BA and BSc exams are used for the law tests, too.         
	Llb examinations had commenced in the first week of August last year. This year, the examinations are unlikely to start before the second week of next month, said an official.         
	The postponements have left students just as irritated as their teachers.        
	My examinations were supposed to end on August 7, and I was to leave for a holiday with my family the very next day. I will have to cancel the trip because my examinations wont be over before August 10, thanks to the transport strike, said a student of business administration.

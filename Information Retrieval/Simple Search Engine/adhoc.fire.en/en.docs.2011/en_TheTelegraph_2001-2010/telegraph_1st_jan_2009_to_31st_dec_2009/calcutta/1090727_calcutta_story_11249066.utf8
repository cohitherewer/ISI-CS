                                                                                                               Test, classes for PhD
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta University has made entrance tests mandatory for MPhil and PhD programmes. Those undertaking doctoral studies at the university will also have to attend classes before focussing on their thesis.        
	Following the instructions of the University Grants Commission (UGC), we have decided to restructure our PhD programmes on the lines of those offered by central universities and institutes like Jawaharlal Nehru University, Hyderabad University and Indian Statistical Institute, said CU vice-chancellor Suranjan Das.        
	The PhD regulations of CU were last revised four years ago.         
	The written entrance test for a PhD candidate will be followed by an interview on his or her area of research. Once through, a candidate will have to attend classes and obtain feedback before concentrating on research. Each thesis will be evaluated by two experts, one of whom must be from outside the state. A viva voce will follow. After the result is declared, a copy of the thesis will be sent to the UGC.        
	MPhil candidates in some departments are already enrolled through entrance tests or oral exams. An entrance test followed by viva voce will be mandatory for all departments from now on.        
	MPhil students will have to submit their dissertation within two years and those pursuing PhD will have to submit their thesis within four years.        
	The tightening of PhD norms is an UGC attempt to ensure supply of quality faculty to higher education institutions. It is a good move but we will have to implement the rules in such a way that potential scholars do not face problems, said Das.        
	For example, he added, 80 per cent of the universitys PhD students are part-timers, most of them full-time teachers in colleges. In order to allow them to attend their PhD classes regularly, the university will schedule them between 3pm and 5pm.        
	We request the state government to ensure that the colleges release the teachers pursuing PhD much before 3pm so that they can attend the classes, said Das.

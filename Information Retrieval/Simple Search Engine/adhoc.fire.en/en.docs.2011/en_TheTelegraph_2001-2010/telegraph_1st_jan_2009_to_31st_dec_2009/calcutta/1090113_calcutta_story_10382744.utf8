The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Land or water body?
                                                                                                               Land or water body?
          ONTHESPOT - PORUI DASPARA POND                          The pond at Porui Daspara, most of which is under a thick cover of water hyacinth, while its edges have become a dumping ground for building materials. Pictures by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                  
	An alleged attempt to fill up a pond in Behala has taken a political turn, pitting rivals the CPM and the Trinamul Congress against each other. The seven-cottah pond at Porui Daspara is in a deplorable condition, with most of it choked with water hyacinth. But no effort can be made towards its restoration as the pond is mired in a legal wrangle, with Calcutta High Court ordering that status quo be maintained at the site.        
	The problem started in early 2004, when members of a local club, Porui Daspara Sammilani, alleged that the owners of the pond had started filling it up.         
	A battle ensued between the owners and the club members. Bablu Das, one of the owners, filed a criminal case against some club members at the police court, said Prashanta Das, a resident.         
	Bablu and the other two owners of the pond  Mridul Das and Tapan Majumdar  are not even sure about the nature of their property.         
	We never had any intention of filling up the pond. There are three owners of the plot. We are not sure whether the two cottahs that my family owns is a water body or land. We approached the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), but even they could not give us a clear answer, said Bapan, Bablus son.        
	Later Bablu filed a title suit in the Alipore judges court, citing that the two-cottah plot he owns has always been a landed property and not a pond. We submitted papers to the court supporting our claim. We petitioned the court to settle the dispute so that we can undertake development work without any resistance, said Bapan.         
	Bablus plea was turned down by the court. We then made a plea before the district judges court. The verdict is still pending, said Bapan.         
	Adding to the legal tangle, the club members moved the high court against the owners. Our petition asked for an injunction against filling up the pond, and requested its restoration to its earlier state. The court has directed maintenance of status quo. The question of restoration is still pending with the court, said Amarendranath Roy, the lawyer representing the club members.         
	In 2004, a letter countersigned by 150 residents was sent to the chairman of the West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB). But the WBPCB authorities have not replied yet. We wrote to Behala police station, the district land revenue officer, fisheries minister Kironmoy Nanda and former city mayor Subrata Mukherjee, among others, said Arun Pramanik, the joint secretary of the club. There has been no response from any of them.         
	Officers of Behala police station once came and stopped work on filling the pond. But that resumed a few days later, said Bapi Das, another club member.         
	The dispute took on political colour after the CPM built a party office on what was allegedly a part of the pond. After the CPM constructed a party office on the premises, the club members increased their agitation, said a resident. The CPM office has come up on land that was donated by us  the three owners of the land, said Bapan.         
	The club members are branding us CPM supporters. They are alleging that we have the support of the local CPM party for filling up the pond. But that is not true, said Bapan. Most of the club members and residents of Daspara are Trinamul supporters, said a resident.         
	Local residents rue the legal and political problems have deprived them the pleasure of having a pond in the vicinity.         
	The pond was used for cultivating fish 15 years back. In the last seven to eight years, waste is being dumped here, said a resident. At present, apart from a heavy growth of water hyacinth, building materials are dumped on the edges of the pond. The club members allege this is being done to fill up the pond. The dust, sand and cement fall into the pond and clog it, said Bapi Das.         
	The CPM councillor of ward 128, Ratna Roy Majumdar, said she has forwarded the complaint of pond-filling to the authorities concerned.         
	I have forwarded the complaint to the assessment department and the mayor. A notice was issued that attempts to fill the pond should be stalled.         
	She, however, refused to comment on the CPM party office. There are no clear records about which portion is land and which is pond. So I wont be able to comment on it.

          A STAFF REPORTER                          An LPG filling station in Burtola. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                   
	Most two-stroke auto operators are glad the transport department and banks are taking long to process their applications for four-stroke replacements, according to officials.        
	The longer this process drags, the better it is for them. Many of those who have submitted their papers are not even eligible for loans, a senior official of the public vehicles department said.        
	Thousands of two-stroke owners have submitted incomplete applications for LPG autos, possibly knowing that they would be rejected. Some of them have hypothecation problems. For example, X had purchased a second-hand auto from Y, who had taken a loan to buy it. Now Y cannot be traced, whereas the name on the documents is his. So that makes X ineligible for the replacement scheme, an official said.        
	Many have not bothered to fill up even the mandatory know-your-customer forms. We have been trying to get the auto owners to complete the process but they havent responded, the official said.        
	A source said advocate-general Balai Rays comment in the high court about auto operators no longer taking the route of physical resistance reflected their mindset. Why should they enter into confrontation when the government has played into their hands by not doing anything about incomplete applications? he wondered.        
	Green activist Subhash Dutta, the petitioner in the case, said the government should not have accepted incomplete applications. How can a bank extend a loan to someone who does not have proper documents? Such applications should be treated separately.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cops block fathers road to justice
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Cops block fathers road to justice
  - Banker alleges probe delay in mentally challenged sons unnatural death          PRONAB MONDAL                           Kingshuk Mukherjee                                        
	A bank officer seeking a probe into the mysterious death of his mentally challenged son in a residential care centre last September is taking the Punit and Rashi Horo road to justice in the face of police indifference.        
	When I first went to Jadavpur East police station to file an FIR, the cops told me: Let the post-mortem report come. When the post-mortem report came, they told me: Let the viscera report come. But I am not one to give up, Pradip Kumar Mukherjee, a resident of Lake Town, told Metro on Thursday.        
	The battle for justice finds a parallel in the tragedy of the Horos, parents of missing teenager Rishensi Neha, whom the police had kept in the dark for four months about her being found dead along rail tracks and cremated within the first fortnight of their frantic search.        
	Pradip and wife Sujatas first-born, 21-year-old Kingshuk, was brought dead to Peerless Hospital from Srijan Sobha  a home for the mentally challenged in Santoshpur  on September 19. The post-mortem report mentions death due to the effects of poisoning and the presence of ante-mortem bruises on the face and right upper body.        
	According to Pradip, investigators at Jadavpur East police station did not register his FIR until October 13, when he lodged a complaint with the superintendent of police of South 24-Parganas. Although an FIR was finally registered after a call from the district police chief to the officer-in-charge, the investigation allegedly hasnt progressed since. They are not even taking cognisance of what the post-mortem report states, Pradip said.        
	The bank officer has accused three members of Srijan Sobha, the home to which he had shifted Kingshuk from another care centre on April 27, of being responsible for his sons death. I chose the home after hearing about yoga being used to minimise mental distress. How was I to know that my son would die there?        
	Urmi Dey, the secretary of Srijan Sobha, denied allegations of torture. I assure you that we do not beat up the inmates, she said.        
	Kingshuk, according to his parents, was a happy child who loved travelling until the mental illness showed up when he was in Class VII. But he was never difficult to manage; he only needed specialised care, for which I was paying Rs 5,500 a month, Pradip said.        
	So what went wrong on September 19? Sunil Chaudhury, the additional SP, said investigators were collecting evidence to strengthen the case.

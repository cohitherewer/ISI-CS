                      Musical communion                    A Chinese hammered dulcimer, the trapezoidal yangqin became known to the Chinese people perhaps through the Silk Route. The santoor, an Indian instrument, is somewhat smaller in size, though of the same shape. Played using two wooden mallets similar to the yangqin, it seems to be a likely predecessor of the latter. However, the technical structure of these two instruments, such as the placing of tuning pegs, bridges and mallets, differ to a great extent. This evening, santoor maestro Pandit Tarun Bhattacharya and noted Chinese yangqin player Professor Liu Yuening present Dialogue, a unique jugalbandi concert that celebrates the magical bond of friendship and harmony that music has the power to create. Hosted by Weavers Studio Centre for the Arts and The Chinese Consulate.                    Event: A duet concert of yangqin and santoor by Professor Liu Yuening and Pandit Tarun Bhattacharya

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Look-out for errant vehicles
                                                                                                               Look-out for errant vehicles
          KINSUK BASU                                    
	Look-out notices, so far issued to catch absconding criminals, are now being used to round up errant vehicles.        
	At least 35 copies of such notices, complete with registration numbers, have been sent in the past three months to all police stations and traffic guards in the city with the order to seize them the moment they are spotted.        
	The regional transport authority, too, has been sent the notices to ensure prompt action against the owners of the errant vehicles.        
	The authorities have come up with the move after failing to curb violation of traffic rules, which include plying vehicles without the mandatory clearances, said an officer.        
	The drive will primarily focus on those who are running vehicles even after their registration has been suspended or plying vehicles with false registration numbers. A number of notices have been issued in the names of bus-owners whose drivers have been repeatedly caught violating traffic rules but have not paid the fine even once.         
	Several notices are in the names of the people whose vehicles are being illegally used as contract carriages.        
	We have learnt about an autorickshaw that was plying with the registration number of a CSTC bus. But the auto cant be spotted now, said a senior traffic police officer.        
	Citing some other cases of rule violation, an officer said Chandan Sharma, a resident of Burdwan, had been receiving traffic violation notices from the city traffic police for a few months. Sharma wrote back to the cops saying the only vehicle he owned, a tractor, had never plied on the city roads.        
	It was then that the police realised that a private bus with a history of traffic rule violation had been plying with the registration number of Sharmas tractor.        
	The cops have also come across vehicles using registration numbers of cars that have been seized by various police stations.        
	There are some taxi drivers who have been repeatedly caught violating traffic rules but have never paid any fine. We tried to track down the owners but most have changed addresses. Most drivers, too, are beyond our reach as they live in the neighbouring districts, said an officer.

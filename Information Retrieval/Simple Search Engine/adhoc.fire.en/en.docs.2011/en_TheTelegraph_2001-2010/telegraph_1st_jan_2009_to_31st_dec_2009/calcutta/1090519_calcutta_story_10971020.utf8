The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Big bookstores beating retreat   Bookstore bids bye
                                                                                                               Big bookstores beating retreat     - Retail-realty slowdown forces 10-month-old address to down shutters          SAIONEE CHAKRABORTY                          Obituary: Odyssey, the 30,000sq ft store on Prince Anwar Shah Road, has shut down. (Aranya Sen)                                        
	The largest bookstore in town has shut shop within 10 months of opening, raising viability questions for new large-format book addresses in the so-called culture capital.        
	Spread over 30,000sq ft, Odyssey on Prince Anwar Shah Road went from boom to bust between July 2008 and May 2009.        
	We shut the store down on May 10, says T.S. Ashwin, the managing director of Odyssey India Ltd, which had brought the Chennai-based chains 31st outlet to the Merlin Residency address last year.        
	So, what went wrong in such a hurry? A combination of expansion plans gone wrong, high rentals and dipping spends that made Mission Calcutta impossible.        
	After travelling to 13 cities, Odyssey had zeroed in on Calcutta for their biggest store. A range of books in vernaculars had been stocked to cash in on the catchment area. Two more stores and 10 express formats were on the radar. But it soon turned out to be a case of being at the wrong place at the wrong time. Our expansion plans in Calcutta were part of the brand expansion strategy across select states. We had signed up for four retail properties in Calcutta, says Ashwin.        
	Two of those were stalled by the realty slowdown, the third  a very large independent store entailing huge investments  seemed foolhardy in the time of retail blues, and the high rentals forced them to stop looking for new options in town.        
	This left us with just one store at Merlin Residency (where too sales were dipping). Maintaining a full back-end for this one store was proving too costly, says Ashwin.                                     
	Till things get back to normal and retail stabilises, Odyssey is out of Calcutta, with the staff being given transfer options to Mumbai, Bangalore or Hyderabad, or a special compensation package.        
	So is there no place for another big bookstore in a so-called books-crazy city? Definitely not in south Calcutta, says Sidharth Pansari of Crossword. Oxford is there, Starmark is there and we are there, so the potential has been exploited. It now depends on how the city expands.        
	Both Pansari and Gautam Jatia of Starmark feel the Odyssey store suffered because of its size and location.        
	So what works in a city that lags far behind a Chennai or a Mumbai when it comes to bookstores? The right size and the right location, chorus Pansari and Jatia.        
	But is the billing of Calcutta as a city of book lovers mere hype? Calcutta is the fifth largest book market after Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai and Bangalore, says Jatia, adding that the majority of revenue from the three Starmark outlets comes from books, not music and films.        
	Some booklovers vote for browsing over buying because of the rising prices. Not many people are buying books. A book that would have cost you Rs 395 two years back, now comes for Rs 695. So new bookstores are not being able to sustain themselves unless they are in malls where people go for some other core activity, says Sagar, an M.Phil student of Jadavpur University.        
	Ashwin does not blame the failed Odyssey on the citys book buyer. Shutting this store has nothing to do with the Calcutta consumer as such, but is a logical and rational decision to focus on select states where our backend expenses are covered better.

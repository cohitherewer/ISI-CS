The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Auto switch runs into bottleneck
                                                                                                               Auto switch runs into bottleneck
          JAYANTA BASU                              
	The worst-hit on Monday, the first full working day since the high court ban on old commercial vehicles came into force on August 1, will be the 40 lakh-odd commuters who travel by autorickshaws.        
	Of the 80,000-odd legal and illegal autos that plied in the city, only around 2,800 are fit to hit the road following the high court order.        
	Sources in the transport department said the government had done nothing to provide the commuters with an alternative arrangement once almost the entire auto fleet went off the road.        
	The solution lies in quick processing of applications for conversion of autos to the four-stroke LPG mode, encouraging the owners of registered autos to apply for conversion and ensuring quick disbursement of bank loans and setting up of adequate LPG outlets, said an official.        
	Sources said less than 5,000 of the 21,000-odd applications for conversion have been processed. Banks have cleared 2,800 applications for loans, while 1,500 more are pending.        
	There are bottlenecks at every stage, said a representative of Bajaj Auto, the makers of most three-wheelers in the city. More than half the applications are incomplete. The transport department and banks are taking a lot of time in processing the valid applications. And even the operators whose applications have been cleared are not getting bank loans.        
	A new twist to the game was transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhurys announcement that autos registered after August 2000 would be allowed to convert to LPG.        
	The conversion cannot take place unless the high court modifies its order, which has imposed a blanket ban on all two-stroke autos, said green activist Subhash Dutta.        
	The centres that retrofit vehicles with LPG kits need to have the state governments approval. Till now, there is no such clearance, said the owner of an LPG kit fitting centre.        
	Among the other bottlenecks is a lack of enough LPG refilling stations, which, Trinamul leader Sobhandeb Chattapadhyay pointed out, was discouraging auto operators from applying for conversion.        
	The leaders point seems to be vindicated by the fact that very few applications have come from Howrah and Hooghly, which do not have any LPG stations.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mishap kills poll official
                                                                                                               Mishap kills poll official
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 45-year-old presiding officer died after being knocked down by a vehicle on Diamond Harbour Road while returning from poll duty early on Thursday.        
	Prabodh Chandra Karmakar was taken to SSKM Hospital where he died hours later.        
	The state government employee, a resident of Thakurpukur, was assigned poll duty in Canning.        
	Witnesses said Karmakar was crossing the road near the 3A bus stand around 1.30am when he was dashed by a speeding vehicle that did not stop after hitting him.        
	We heard a muffled cry and rushed to the spot and found him lying on the ground, bathed in blood, said one of the men who took Karmakar to hospital.        
	S.K. Chowdhury, the superintendent of police (industrial), ruled out foul play. It looks like a road accident. A post-mortem has been conducted.

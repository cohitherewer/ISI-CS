The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fog hits morning flights
                                                                                                               Fog hits morning flights
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Fog disrupted flights at Calcutta airport on Wednesday morning.        
	Between 5am and 8am, visibility dropped to below 350 metres in phases, during which no flight could take off or land, an airport official said. This delayed other flights by 30 minutes to an hour on an average, he added.        
	Airport sources said visibility improved slightly around 6.30am and some flights took off, but it became foggy again.        
	A Calcutta-London flight of British Airways was the first international flight to take off from Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport on Wednesday. The flight left at 8.15am, three hours behind schedule.        
	In the domestic sector, Air Indias Calcutta-Port Blair flight was the first to take off, at 6.15am. It was scheduled to leave at 5.35am. Fifteen flights were delayed during the day as the morning backlog was being cleared.        
	Officials of the Met department at the airport said there was a possibility of dense fog on Thursday, too.         
	The city is likely to feel a dip in the temperature in the next 48 hours. Tuesday was the warmest day in January in a decade, with the minimum temperature soaring to 21.6 degrees Celsius. On Wednesday, the minimum temperature came down marginally, to 21.1 degrees. The North Wind is becoming strong again. We expect the minimum temperature to drop in the next two days, a Met official said.

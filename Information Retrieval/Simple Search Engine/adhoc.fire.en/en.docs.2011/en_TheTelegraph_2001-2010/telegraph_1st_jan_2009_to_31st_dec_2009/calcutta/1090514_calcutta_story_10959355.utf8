The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | More the change, less the change
                                                                                                               More the change, less the change
                            
	As Calcutta went to the polls to elect its next national government I wondered what would happen if the parar mashimas ran the polling booths? Thats exactly what happens when the worlds most powerful democracy votes for its president.        
	At your polling place in the US, you will rarely find queues or gun-toting security. And the officials in charge of giving ballots, matching names to registers  in short, running elections, are typically local civic-minded people, many retired, and mostly women in their 50s and 60s. During the election of the worlds most powerful leader, polling places have the atmosphere of an afternoon tea party.        
	In Calcutta, election day feels like a bandh. All stores are shuttered and the roads are empty. Children play cricket while the adults are tense. Who will win and how much irregularities and violence will be required for the result?         
	After all these weeks of banners, mikes and michhils, voting day is an anti-climax of eerie calm. Didi may be running for MP, but on the ground, the profile of those running elections is young, tough and male.         
	Election day is not a holiday in the US. All shops are open, transport runs and everyone goes to work. Apart from some queues before and after office hours, you can hardly find a crowd anywhere. Schools are popular polling places even in the US, but I have never seen commandos with guns aimed out of classroom windows as I saw in my constituency in Kankurgachhi on Wednesday morning.         
	Voting in the US is not accompanied by threats, recriminations and violence to ensure people dont vote. Most citizens dont vote anyway, especially the poor, and the youth.         
	Republican and Democratic Party workers knock on doors, make phone calls, and drive constituents to the polls to make sure they bother to vote. Civic groups organise voter registration drives in the run up to the polls.        
	Here, when CPM and Trinamul party workers come to your door, they dont want you to vote, so much as they want your vote, with or without your participation. Nothing pleases them more than to find that your uncle and aunt are now abroad, or your cousin has moved house and thus wont be at the polling place.         
	In America, parties try to get out the vote. In India they try to keep the other partys vote out. All of this is not to say that election irregularities dont happen in the rich First World. When you have old ladies in the frontline on democracys D-Day, administrative foul-ups are inevitable.         
	Also, there is no dictatorial Election Commissioner or a centralised top-down command structure for elections. How elections are run, the kinds of ballots and machines that are used are determined locally and vary widely across constituencies.        
	To this day, some polling places still use paper ballots while others have joined the 21st Century.         
	In the 2000 election that brought George W. Bush to White House, badly designed ballots, non-functioning machines and inaccurate voter lists in Florida created chaos. The election was ultimately decided by the US Supreme Court. To this date, many Democrats maintain that Bushs opponent Al Gore had actually received more votes.         
	But there wasnt any blood on Washingtons streets in 2000. And eight years later, after Bushs unpopular term was over, millions of disillusioned Americans returned to the polls inspired by the optimism and eloquence of Barack Obama. Lakhs of immigrants became US citizens to vote for the son of a Kenyan. Obamas 2008 campaign slogan was Change, and after seven years of war, deception and fear-mongering, for many Americans, to vote for Obama was to end a nightmare.         
	On election day in Calcutta, no such catharsis awaits. Those who say Paribartan chai know full well that Mr Paribartan isnt running from any constituency this time.         
	Election in the US is a one-day match. The whole nation votes at the same time, and by midnight the results are declared. Here of course, like all our festivals, elections happen in phases.        
	Even now, that all the votes have been cast, and all the hurly-burly done, another two days of anticipation and prognostication will follow, before the final scores are settled.

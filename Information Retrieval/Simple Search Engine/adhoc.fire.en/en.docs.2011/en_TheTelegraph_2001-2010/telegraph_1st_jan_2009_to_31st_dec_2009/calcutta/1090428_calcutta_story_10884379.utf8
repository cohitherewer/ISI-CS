The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Library holds its breath
                                                                                                               Library holds its breath
  - Election panel move to invade address goes into extra time          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	The Election Commission remained undecided on the eve of its scheduled invasion of the National Library, even as readers and staff members kept their fingers crossed about the Alipore campus being spared by the poll machinery.        
	According to the commissions earlier missive to the library  following which Metro launched a campaign against the move  it would use the premises for 20 days starting April 28.        
	I am yet to receive any official intimation from the Election Commissions office. Let us hope for the best, said K.K. Banerjee, the director of the National Library.        
	Chief electoral officer (CEO) Debashis Sen, who was supposed to take a final call on Monday, appeared to be weighing all options.        
	We are yet to arrive at a decision on the issue. At the moment we are considering possibilities and working towards a conclusion. We dont have much time and the decision must be taken very soon, Sen told Metro.        
	Our exact plan of action is yet to be chalked out but whatever we do, wed keep the convenience of the readers and staff members of the library at the top of our list of priorities, he added.        
	The promise of minimising inconvenience caused to the library is not what readers and officials are waiting to hear from the commission.        
	Once the poll army marches in, all such promises are forgotten. In 2006, the library premises resembled barracks with hundreds of personnel in several makeshift tents on the grounds, recalled a librarian.        
	The horrors of the charge of the poll brigade in 2006 are fresh on the minds of several people on campus. They turned the greens into a dumping ground and left without cleaning up the mess, said a library official.        
	A security official recounted how some readers had been harassed at the gates by policemen. It was only after readers protested did the poll officials take some corrective steps, he said.        
	Amit Basu, a regular visitor to the reading room for two decades, shuddered at the thought of the temporary sheds, littered greens, open-air kitchens, the smoke and stench... returning to the library premises.        
	Why is the Election Commission hell-bent on violating the sanctity of the National Library yet again? asked Basu.        
	Calcutta awaits an answer to that question, CEO Sen.

                Several parts of the city suffered power cuts on Monday evening. Power department officials said the disruption was caused by technical faults in the distribution system. Around 6pm, the Kolaghat-Howrah distribution line that supplies power to the CESC grid tripped and the CESC substations in Kasba and Prinsep Street developed faults. Normal supply was restored around 7pm after repairs, said a CESC official.     A 28-year-old driver was arrested on Monday for attacking two people with a razor in a 14th-floor flat of Saptaparni Apartment in Ballygunge on Sunday. Police said Manoj Singh entered the flat at 10pm and stabbed help Ganga Mondal, 60, and cook Narayan Naik, 65, after an altercation. Police said the three worked for the same family. The duo were taken to hospital with chest injuries.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta University on Tuesday finalised a string of steps to make undergraduate exams easier.         
	The changes will take effect from the current academic session, said Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee, the CU pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs).        
	The changes, proposed by the undergraduate council and ratified by the universitys highest policy making body, the syndicate, include pushing back of the compulsory environmental education exam from Part I to Part III. The full marks have been increased from 50 to 100.         
	Honours students will also not have to clear the pass papers in Part I to appear for Part II. They can clear the backlog along with the Part II papers.        
	The students of the general courses in the three streams will be allowed to appear for Part II even if they clear only one of their three elective papers in Part I. They will have to clear the backlog with the Part II papers.        
	In another student-friendly move, the university will award a grace mark to all honours students who fall short of 50, 55 or 60 per cent by one mark. General students will be granted a grace mark if they fall one short of 40 or 50 per cent.         
	The marksheets of all those who benefit will however state that an extra mark has been awarded.

                                                                                                               Bus kills, pool car wounds
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The mangled remains of the pool car. (Sanat Kr Sinha)                                  
	A 51-year-old pedestrian was mowed down by a racing minibus while 12 kindergarten kids had a lucky escape in a pool car crash caused by rash driving on Calcuttas calamity streets on Thursday.        
	Biman Roy, a clerk with the Railway Mail Service, and a colleague were standing in line with a divider at the Moulali crossing on APC Roy Road when a minibus (WB-04 1816) racing another swerved to the right and hit them both. As Roy fell, the rear wheels of the bus crushed his chest.        
	The driver was at fault, said Tapas Kumar Bose, the officer-in-charge of Muchipara police station.         
	Niranjan Kumar Ram, the assistant postmaster accompanying the victim, was admitted to NRS hospital with hand and leg injuries. He and Roy, a resident of 17/2D Beleghata Main Road, had attended a staff event at Moulali Yuva Kendra in the afternoon.         
	In another accident, three students aged between 5 and 8 sustained bruises while nine others escaped unhurt when their pool car collided with a Maruti Alto at the Hudco intersection around 12.25pm.        
	The police quoted witnesses as saying that the Tata Sumo driver, Madhab Banerjee, lost control at high speed and grazed a private bus and an autorickshaw before colliding with the Alto. All 12 children were on their way back home from Mangalam Vidyaniketan at Lake Town, off VIP Road. The three students sitting in front sustained minor hand and leg injuries. They were taken to a nursing home, a police officer said.         
	The Sumo (WB-02 T4937) is not a registered pool car.        
	Finu Lahoti, the mother of Class I student Raunak, said her son would need time to get over the shock. He is very scared and has been in bed since arriving home, the resident of Narkeldanga said.        
	Two more persons were injured in an accident on Thursday. A speeding bus on route number 205 dashed the duo in front of MR Bangur Hospital. The condition of one of them, Mohammad Alam, is critical.

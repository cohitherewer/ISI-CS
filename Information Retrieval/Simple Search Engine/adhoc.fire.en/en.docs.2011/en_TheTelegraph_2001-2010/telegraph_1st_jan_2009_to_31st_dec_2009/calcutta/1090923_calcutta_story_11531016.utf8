The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | User fee at airport awaits take-off
                                                                                                               User fee at airport awaits take-off
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Passengers flying out of Calcutta will have to pay extra if a proposal taxiing on the Airports Authority of India runway is given the take-off signal by the Centre.        
	The cash-strapped wing of the Union ministry of civil aviation is planning to introduce user development fee (UDF) at 11 airports, including Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport.        
	This will be on the lines of private-run airports like Bangalore and Hyderabad.         
	We will submit the proposal for UDF at our airports to the Public Investment Board and the Airports Regulatory Authority in about a months time, V.P. Agarwal, the chairman of the Airports Authority, said on Tuesday.        
	He, however, sweetened the bitter pill for passengers by stressing that the UDF would be lower than that charged by the private operators in Bangalore and Hyderabad  where domestic passengers have to pay Rs 300 and international passengers Rs 1,300.        
	The proposed UDF is around 70 to 80 per cent of the amount charged at private airports, claimed Agarwal.        
	Whatever be the rates, the imposition of UDF will result in a rise in fares. Any increase in fare is bad news for the industry. But if the development fee is used for augmentation of facilities and smoother entry and exit at the airport, passengers are less likely to complain, said a travel agent.        
	Airports Authority sources said this was part of the plan to raise funds to run the airports better. The authority runs 40 airports but only the 11 that have international operations come under the UDF plan.        
	Once the Rs 2,000 crore modernisation project of the airport is complete by 2011, Calcutta is expected to handle 11 million passengers.        
	Agarwal also said on Tuesday that non-operational land at 24 airports across the country would be leased out to private parties for raising funds. At Calcutta airport, a 45-acre plot would be leased out to set up budget hotels and commercial complexes.        
	The projects would be implemented through public-private partnership (PPP). We expect to raise around Rs 250 crore by leasing out the land, said Agarwal.        
	Calcutta airport officials said some international airlines were poised to come to the city. Cathay Pacific will have Calcutta as its alternative base, said an airport official.        
	Low-cost carrier Air Asia will start operations between Calcutta and Kuala Lumpur in November. Thai Asia, another low-cost carrier, is expected to start operations to Bangkok soon.

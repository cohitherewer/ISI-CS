										      Uddalak Mukherjee meets Rabin Sengupta, who had captured the Bangladesh War of 1971 with his camera                                         From top: A family takes shelter in a trench to escape bombs in Agartala in mid-1971; the photographer (seated, far right), with members of Mujibur Rehmans family in Bangladesh after their release on December 18, 1971; tribal women in Tripura.

	While chatting with Rabin Sengupta, it becomes difficult to separate the raconteur from the photographer. Sengupta, a sprightly man in his late 70s, who started his career as a freelance press photographer in 1952, has captured momentous occasions on film. Sifting through his collection of photographs, many of which were published in Calcuttas newspapers, one can catch the horror of the people and places ravaged by the Bangladesh war, as well as the quiet beauty and rich tribal heritage of Tripura where he was born.         
	But Sengupta is not only a skilled photographer: like Rushdies Rashid Khalifa, he is also a gifted storyteller. Khalifa may have lost his gift temporarily, but Sengupta retains his ability to mesmerise with tales that straddle fact and fiction, time and place.        
	Born in 1930, in Agartala, Senguptas interest in photography was kindled by his polymath father, Prafulla.         
	Prafulla, along with his older sibling, Ramesh, had opened a studio called Sen and Sen in 1910. He was an exponent of medicine and magic. PC Sorcar considered him his mentor.         
	Rameshs interest in photography had blossomed under the tutelage of Sambarna Chandra Deb Barman, the son of Birchandra Manikya Deb Barman, the king of Tripura, who was an able painter and a connoisseur of the arts and literature.         
	Much earlier, in 1840, Surjomani Sengupta, an ayurvedic doctor from Nababpur in Dhaka, had set sail upriver to Tripura on the invitation of the king. The lands beauty and the availability of medicinal herbs made Surjomani stay on, and his descendants continued to share a close bond with the royals.         
	Surjomani is Senguptas ancestor, and the latters eyes twinkle as he reminisces about the afternoons he spent following his father in the andarmahal, peering at the immense rooms, furniture and the princesses from Manipur with milky, white skin.        
	After the completion of his studies, Sengupta started managing the studio, which by then had three branches. But his calling, he knew, lay elsewhere. With his trusted Rolleiflex by his side, he started travelling and taking pictures, and by 1952, his photographs were being published in Ananda Bazar Patrika, Jugantar, Amrita Bazar and Hindustan Standard.         
	His first published photograph, Sengupta remembers, was that of a tribal girl working in a maize field, an image that captured the ties that bind human dignity and poverty. He encountered harsher truths in his long career. In 1971, he travelled extensively in Bangladesh, covering the birth of a nation among the brutalities inflicted by the enemy, as well as the hardship and the ultimate triumph of the Mukti Bahini and the Indian army.         
	In a telling image, Sengupta captures the Mukti Bahini cadre saluting an enlarged, framed photograph of their leader in a training camp in a forest. The faces of the young soldiers are steely and expressionless, symbolising the onset of a scarred youth and lost innocence.         
	Sengupta is dismissive of the modern practice of embedded photojournalism. If a photographer or a reporter were to be embedded with the army, his movements would be severely restricted, pushing him further away from the truth, says Sengupta.        
	Photography has taken Sengupta to many places, won him laurels as well as the affection of many men and women. He has travelled to the former Soviet Union and Brazil.         
	In 1959, he won recognition in an exhibition in Brazil, while three years later, he was honoured with a membership by the Royal Photographic Society of Great Britain.         
	An avid Marxist, he knew Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi personally, and, expectedly, is a great admirer of Jyoti Basu and EMS Namboodiripad.         
	Sengupta has many documentaries and books to his credit. He recounts with great affection his meeting with Satyajit Ray, who leafed through a picture album of his, even as he stood against a wall smoking a cigarette on the road near the Technicians studio.         
	Two of his books, including Chitrasangbadiker Cameray Muktijuddho, have been published from Dhaka.        
	Despite his years, Sengupta still seeks out exhibitions and films. He has a keen interest in politics and predicts that the Left Front would sweep the forthcoming polls. Unlike his photographs however, this may be far from the truth.

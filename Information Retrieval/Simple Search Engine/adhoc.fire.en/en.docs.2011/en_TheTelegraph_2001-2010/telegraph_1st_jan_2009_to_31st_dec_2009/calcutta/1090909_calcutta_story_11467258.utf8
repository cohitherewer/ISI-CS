The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rain no longer in red
                                                                                                               Rain no longer in red
  - Downpour turns city deficit into surplus          OUR BUREAU                                                      
	Tuesdays downpour washed away the citys rainfall deficit this season and pushed it into surplus in less than 24 hours.        
	A low-pressure formation over the Bay of Bengal resulted in 92.7mm of rain in 24 hours till 5.30pm on Tuesday  the highest since May 25 when the city received 93.1mm in the Aila effect  leaving large parts of the city waterlogged and commuters inconvenienced (see page 20).        
	The heavy rain can be attributed to a low-pressure area over the Bay that formed in less than 24 hours. The system caused heavy rain in most parts of south Bengal, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre, Alipore.        
	The intensity of the rain is likely to lessen after Wednesday afternoon but all meteorological parameters are pointing at intermittent showers right till  and maybe through  Puja 2009.        
	Calcutta and its neighbourhood will receive substantial rain till the last week of September, though the intensity is likely to be much less than what we are witnessing now, said an official of the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting, which functions under the Union ministry of earth sciences.        
	If revellers are worried over a wet Puja two weeks from now, idol-makers are struggling to meet immediate deadlines. I cant work. My roof is leaking and the water is spoiling the idols, said Shailen Pal at the artisans hub in Kumartuli.        
	About 10 per cent of our work has been ruined because of the incessant rain over the past few days, rued Babu Pal, the joint secretary of the Kumartuli Mritshilpa Sanskriti Samity.        
	An official at the regional Met centre said the city till Tuesday had received 1,125mm of rain against the average projection of 1,035mm for the entire duration of the monsoon.        
	The deficit of 3.86 per cent till Monday, down from around 18 per cent on August 7, turned into a surplus of 8.7 per cent by 5.30pm on Tuesday. The surplus will keep rising with three to four weeks of the monsoon still to go, said the chief meteorologist of a private agency.         
	In the first eight days of September, the city has received 94 per cent of the average 295.9mm rain for the month.        
	In just five days since Friday, the city has received over 275mm of rain, more than twice that recorded in the entire month of July (130mm) and also higher than the 269.2mm of rainfall in August.

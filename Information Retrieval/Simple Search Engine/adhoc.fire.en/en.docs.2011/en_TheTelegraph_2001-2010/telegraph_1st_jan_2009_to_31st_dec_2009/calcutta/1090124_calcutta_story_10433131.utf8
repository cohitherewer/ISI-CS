The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Runaway robbers back in net
                                                                                                               Runaway robbers back in net
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two undertrials, who had managed to give careless cops at Bankshal court the slip on December 8, were arrested on Friday.        
	Sleuths from the detective department cornered the fugitive duo on a street of Bamunghata in North 24-Parganas.        
	Raju Paswan and Rajesh Prajapati, wanted for a number of robberies, were taken to Lalbazar police headquarters. They will be produced in court on Saturday.        
	Raju and Rajesh had been taken to Bankshal court on December 8 for a hearing. While one policeman went to complete the paperwork, another went to relieve himself, leaving the rear door of the police van ajar. The two slid open the collapsible gate and melted into the crowd. A third undertrial was caught before he could slip away.        
	The police initiated departmental proceedings against assistant sub-inspector Manoj Kumar Chakrabarty and constable Raghunath Digar, who were escorting the duo.        
	The two were on the run together, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police (detective department). They even fled to a remote village in Bihar but then came back with our officers on their heels.        
	The police received a tip-off that the two had entered North 24-Parganas a few days back. Specific information about their location reached Lalbazar late on Thursday.        
	Around 3pm, we spotted the duo walking down a road, accosted them and hauled them into a van, said an officer.        
	This time, the door of the van stayed shut and the cops responded to the call of duty, rather than of nature.

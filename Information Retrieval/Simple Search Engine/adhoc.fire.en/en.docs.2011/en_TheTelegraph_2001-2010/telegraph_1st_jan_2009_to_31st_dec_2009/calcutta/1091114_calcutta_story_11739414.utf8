          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A 35-year-old man who got his friend to stab him so that he could fake a robbery on the road and pocket Rs 4.1 lakh ended up behind bars with 37 stitches on his back.         
	Kapil Nath Gupta, who withdrew the money from a private bank in Middleton Street for his employer, told police that he needed the money for his sisters wedding.        
	A bleeding Gupta walked into Bowbazar police station on Friday afternoon and told cops that he was attacked by two bike-borne youths on Prafulla Sarkar Street, who robbed the money he was carrying to his office in British India Street.        
	Officers rushed Gupta, who hails from Allahabad and lives in Sinthee in the city, to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital.        
	There were large wounds on his back and arms. Even the doctors were stumped at the number of injuries on his body. They took a long time to stitch the wounds, said an officer.        
	Cops then took Gupta to the detective department in Lalbazar where, after almost three hours of interrogation, he allegedly confessed that he rode a bike to central Calcutta from the bank.        
	Riding pillion was his aide Guddu, who later stabbed Gupta, said one of the investigators.        
	Both Guddu and Gupta were arrested and the entire amount was recovered from a shop in Cotton Street in the evening.         
	Fuel haul: Seven men were arrested and 1,000 litres of petrol and diesel were seized on Friday morning from 44A bus stand in Salt Lakes Sector V. Police said the fuel was to be sold in the black market. Cops also seized two vehicles which were being used to transport the fuel.

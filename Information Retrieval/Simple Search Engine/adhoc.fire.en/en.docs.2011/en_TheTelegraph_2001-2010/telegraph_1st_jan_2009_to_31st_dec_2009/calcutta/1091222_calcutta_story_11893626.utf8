The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Celsius on a slide, finally
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Celsius on a slide, finally
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The Calcutta winter has got back its chill with the minimum temperature on Monday dropping to 15.7 degrees Celsius, two points above normal, For the past four days, the minimum temperature was locked at four degrees above normal.        
	Experts feel a host of atmospheric conditions could drag the mercury down by another couple of degrees over the next 72 hours.        
	The drop in the mercury has been primarily brought about by the absence of any formation over the Bay, which has rid the atmosphere of moisture and cleared the way for the cold, dry wind from the north, said a scientist at the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting, Noida.        
	Add to that the passage of the residue of a western disturbance (cool, moisture-laden winds from the Mediterranean region) across eastern India.        
	Another western disturbance, which now hovers over Jammu and Kashmir, could pass through south Bengal during the week.        
	All these factors could result in a drop of the mercury by a couple of degrees across the Indo-Gangetic plains over the next 72 hours, the scientist at the Noida centre said. The minimum temperature should come down to normal (14 degrees Celsius) by Wednesday and slide further later in the week.        
	The Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore said the sky on Tuesday was likely to remain mainly clear and the minimum temperature would hover around the 14-degree mark. There is, however, no guarantee that the trend would last beyond the week.

                                                                                                                   Creativity let loose

	With books at bay, learning was four days of unadulterated fun for city students, courtesy Bal Vividha or the Harek Rokom Ba education fair organised jointly by Birla Industrial and Technological Museum and the Mumbai-based organisation Comet Media Foundation in December.        
	Education for Change was the theme for the fair that turned three this year. Its aim is to induce children to use their analytical and creative faculties to explore their areas of interest. The inaugural day kicked off with theatreperson Saoli Mitra reminiscing her childhood days, followed by a session by artist Hiron Mitra, who shared tidbits with students about his childhood.         
	Hiron Mitra made a mask in a few minutes and showed how it could be used to reflect emotions like gloomy, angry or happy, drawing cheers from the crowd.         
	The fair included activity corners, film screenings and cultural shows. Toys to encourage structure building skills by Comet found place alongside a reading corner by the British Council Library. Stalls demonstrated the use of the ancient calculating device, abacus, calligraphy and Vedic mathematics.         
	Don Bosco Ashalayam, a home for destitute children and Suresh Amiya Memorial Trust displayed craftwork by the inmates. Subhajit Naskar, a Class XI student of Baruipur High School loved Know Your Rights, where issues of protection, participation, survival and education were illustrated through an interactive game format. It is much better than learning from textbooks, where information is only memorised, he said.         
	On the sidelines were puppet shows, an event called Rhyme and Doodle where illustrator Anup Ray drew impromptu sketches to the accompaniment of recitation, plays on global warming and human rights, folk dance and a quiz on biodiversity. Films like The Snakeboy and the Sand Castle and Hirer Angti were screened. About 20,000 students from schools like Don Bosco Park Circus, Sri Shikshayatan, The Heritage School and Lakshmipat Singhania Academy attended the fair.

	YESTERDAY ONCE MORE        
	Many have passed through its hallowed portals since Birla High School for Boys, earlier known as Hindi High School, was set up in 1943 by Lakshmi Nivas Birla. On January 10, its alumni will host its 12th reunion dinner on the school premises in association with The Telegraph.         
	The alumni was formed out of meetings of ex-students in the second Saturday of every January. Today, membership to the group is for a lifetime membership of Rs 3,500.         
	The scions of the largest business families in the city, including the Birlas, the Jhawars and Kejriwals have passed out from here, said vice-president of the alumni committee, Arun Kumar Dalmia. This year, the alumni, which boasts more than 600 members, has set up a benevolent fund that will extend financial aid to retired teachers and needy but meritorious students. The alumni is also considering taking up the maintenance of the park opposite the school.         
	We are starting with a capital of more than Rs 25 lakh, said Dalmia. They have also received help from industry in their efforts.         
	Over the years, the alumni has also organised entrepreneurship development programmes and career counselling workshops for outgoing students.         
	Last year, some of our old students had flown in from abroad for the reunion dinner. We hope this year will see many more of them, said Dalmia.

	CHIT CHAT        
	Little ones win hearts         
	Children of Rose Bud Montessori took part in a cultural programme at Girish Manch on December 28. They sang, danced and even recited before a packed house. A musical on the drama of life was also staged. The performance of the little ones left the audience spellbound.        
	Freshers welcome        
	Music, dance, food, fun and frolic marked the freshers day celebration at Indian Institute of Aeronautical Science. From rap to soulful Hindi film melodies of yore, the seniors sang all to welcome the freshers at the Dum Dum municipality Town hall on December 24. Even Bhojpuri dance figured in the list of activities that continued from 10 in the morning to 5pm. We wanted to have this event for a long time. We even practised for hours without food, said Soumendra Goswami, a third-year student. The third-year band, playing the songs of Rock On, brought the curtains down on the event. The first in six years since the institute started, this event has set the ball rolling for more.         
	Annual day         
	Students of National High School (girls and boys) celebrated their annual day on December 19 and 20. The event started with a cultural programme by the primary section of the girls school, including fusion and folk dance and a play titled Modern Ramayana. The middle school staged a fashion show titled Elements. The high school students staged a play, My Fair Lady.

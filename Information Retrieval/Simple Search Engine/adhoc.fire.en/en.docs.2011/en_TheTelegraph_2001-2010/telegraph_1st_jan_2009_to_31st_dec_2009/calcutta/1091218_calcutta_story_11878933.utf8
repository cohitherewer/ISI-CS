The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Court orders OCs arrest
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Court orders OCs arrest
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Thursday ordered the arrest of the officer-in-charge of Dum Dum police station, Sukumar Nandi, for his failure to attend court and produce a person against whom a contempt notice has been issued.        
	Justice Sanjib Banerjee asked the superintendent of North 24-Parganas police, Rahul Srivastav, to arrest Nandi and produce him in court on January 14.        
	When Metro called Nandi, he said he had suffered an injury on his right knee. A senior officer of the district police backed the statement, saying: The OC could not attend court on Thursday as he has been admitted to hospital and will undergo knee surgery.        
	Justice Banerjee had asked the OC to execute an arrest order issued by a lower court against Tapan Kundu, a Barasat resident who had been held guilty in a land dispute with his brother.        
	As Nandi failed to arrest Kundu, Justice Banerjee asked him to file an affidavit stating why the order was not carried out.         
	The OCs clarification did not satisfy the judge, who then asked Nandi to appear before him on Thursday.         
	But the officer failed to show up during the day, prompting the judge to order his arrest.         
	The lawyer representing the petitioner, Tapan Kundus brother Sukumar, said Nandi had earlier ignored several orders of the Barasat civil court to arrest Tapan.

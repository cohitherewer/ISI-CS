The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Port launches clear-up
                                                                                                               Port launches clear-up

	The port authorities, under fire from exporters and shipping lines, are trying to speed up clearing space in the dock area to facilitate container ship movement.         
	Sources said on Friday that the authorities were trying to move the piled-up boxes to three private container freight stations nearby. The authorities said they would monitor the situation and call in ships if the situation improved, said Ashok Jankiraman, the president of the Association of Shipping Interests in Calcutta.        
	Ramesh Agarwal, the eastern region chairman of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations, said the authorities should have started the clear-up process long ago. The mess cannot be cleared overnight. Goods worth a few thousand crores are stuck, he said. Seasonal goods like dry fruits and gift items meant for Diwali need to be evacuated urgently.        
	Port officials told shipping lines on Wednesday that container ships would not be able to call at the port because of congestion in the dock area.        
	Mukul Roy, the minister of state for shipping, said situation would be under control. Many ships have come in and hence the congestion. It is a sign that Calcutta is getting good business.        
	Port officials said the evacuation had been streamlined. Port officials said five container vessels had been pressed into service and three more were due on Saturday.        
	However, truck drivers waiting to enter the dock said the cranes had started becoming defunct four years ago but no one had bothered.

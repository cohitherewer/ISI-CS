The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Citizen vote goes to library
                                                                                                               Citizen vote goes to library
  - Readers amp; writers protest poll panel playing predator          A STAFF REPORTER                                                        
	The Election Commission may have followed the rulebook but has violated its spirit by treating a two-line requisition notice to National Library as a licence to barge in and take over the premises, say readers and officials.        
	We need a detailed requisition plan, not a cursory notice. We need to know which portions of our premises the commission intends using for election-related work and how. It is not only about us and them, but also thousands of readers who spend time among books every working day, director K.K. Banerjee told Metro.        
	Banerjee and his team at National Library  an imposing Raj-era structure surrounded by around 30 acres of greens  are banking on the support of these readers to stave off yet another invasion of the Alipore landmark. In the eyes of most readers, the commission is guilty of the same misuse of power that it tries to stop political parties from committing.        
	Section 160 of the Representation of Peoples Act permits the Election Commission to take over any public premises for poll-related work, but not by wresting anybodys fundamental right in the bargain. The commission may be within its rights to requisition National Library, but does it have the right to deny me access to the reading room that I visit regularly? asked Dibyendu Das, a member of the readers forum. We will write to the director, expressing solidarity in opposing the takeover. The message to everyone should be: stay off National Library from now.        
	Saibal Chakraborty, the general secretary of the National Library Staff Association, is worried about the trend of the protector playing the predator at the library. The last time the election juggernaut had rolled in, we didnt know what hit us. They saw, they came and they set up camp. By the time they left, everything was in a mess. They did not even bother to clean up. I remember it took us nearly a week to remove the litter, he said.        
	Regulars at the library reading room said they had expected the Election Commission to learn from Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs apology for attending a business meet in 2005 that had inconvenienced readers. It is a library and its sanctity will be violated (if the commission takes over the premises). There are other places; why do they need to requisition this place? wondered Sukumari Bhattacharjee.        
	Director Banerjee intends moving the Union culture ministry, under which National Library operates, if the election panel insists on moving in. The commission is standing its ground. Chief electoral officer Debashis Sen said they would have opted out if they had the option.

	It was a welcome two-day break from studies but it involved as much hard work. In the end, the annual cultural fest of BD Memorial Institute was a grand success.         
	The first days events were held at Nazrul Mancha. The curtains went up with Ek Shaam Apni Maati ke Naam  an adaptation of Rabindranath Tagores dance drama Samanya Kshoti  performed by the middle and high school students. Another dance drama, Akbars Court, threw light on the freedom of religion advocated by the Mughal emperor.        
	Shyamasree Nandi, a Class XI student, did well as the protagonist in Harirani, a musical adaptation of a famous Rajasthani folklore.         
	We had three days to practise but thanks to our teachers, we picked up the dance steps fast, said Shyamasree.         
	The action shifted to Madhusudan Mancha on the second day. The students began with an invocation to God and went on to stage a dance recital, Allah Tero Naam, on equality of religion.         
	This was followed by Come Lets Have Fun, a medley of dances performed by toddlers and students of the primary section. The young ones made a pretty picture as they dressed up in the traditional attire of various states and grooved to catchy numbers.         
	It was great fun helping out the juniors, said Shreya Chowdhury, a Class XI student, amidst the chaos backstage.         
	Boys dressed in dhotis and girls in saris recreated a rural picture onstage as they danced to popular folk songs. Not to be left behind, the pre-primary students presented My India, My Pride, a musical on national integration.         
	Students up to Class VII also presented Anubhutiyan, a dance on emotions and relationships.         
	We mixed various dance forms like Bharatanatyam, Kathak and Tandav, explained the schools dance teacher Sudha Deb Anand.         
	The finale was a dance depicting protest against terrorism. It is a way of making students aware of the sacrifices that our martyrs have made and of instilling patriotism in them, explained Usha Mehta, the founder and director of the school.

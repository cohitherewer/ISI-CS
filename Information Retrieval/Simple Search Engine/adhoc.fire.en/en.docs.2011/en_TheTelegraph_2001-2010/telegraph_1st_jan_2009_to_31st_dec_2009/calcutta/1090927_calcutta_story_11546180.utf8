The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | STRAIGHT FROM THE HEART
                                                                                                               STRAIGHT FROM THE HEART
          SUDESHNA BANERJEE                                                
	A movement begun seven autumns ago found a new champion this Ashtami with Mitali of Kankurgachhi being crowned Model Puja 2009.        
	Winners of CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja, held in association with Rupa, were picked after a day-long tour across town  and beyond the river  by a quintet of judges who had an eye for goodness rather than grandeur.        
	Six pujas had made it to the final list after two days of scrutiny at 267 pandals of facilities and measures that made Durga puja safer for visitors and more meaningful for people in general.        
	The scrutiny was more stringent this year given the high court-ratified rules, which were explained to the judges  the British deputy high commissioner of eastern India Sanjay Wadvani, veteran actor Barun Chanda, actress Paoli Dam, fashion designer Agnimitra Paul and Dilip Samajpati of CESC  in detail by city police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti at the flag-off.        
	In True Spirit Pujas rulebook, budget is not a criterion. So, pujas with moderate budgets like Yuvak Gosthi in Behala (Rs 4.5 lakh) could compete with the likes of Mudiali Club (Rs 20 lakh). Both in fact won Four Star status.        
	Undue ostentation was frowned upon. Whats the point of layering a street corner with marble tiles for four days, when it cannot even be used later, wondered Chanda, at one of the pujas.        
	Mitali scored on this count by using throw-away materials like soiled cloth and strings to form the core of dokra-style figurines that decorated the pandal. The structure would be dismantled and sent to Chandernagore to be recycled for Jagaddhatri puja.        
	Carbon footprint guided consul-general Wadvanis score sheet as did community participation. He was impressed by the all-for-one bond among residents of Olabibitola Sarbojanin Durgotsav Committee in Howrah. Even the priest there was a club member. That is why I dare to take the puja sankalpa in my name, shouldering risk of the Devis wrath if anything goes amiss in the rituals, smiled Somnath Banerjee, after conducting the anjali in which most of the judges took part. The Devi must have smiled on the puja. It was given Four Star status.        
	Last years Model Puja Tridhara Sammilani, near Deshapriya Park, ran Mitali close. The entry and exit points were the most spacious, observed Agnimitra, comparing them with the entry point of 41 Pally Club of Haridevpur where visitors could squeeze in only in a single file from the main road.        
	But 41 Pallys elaborate medical arrangements touched a chord. Both pujas got Five Star status.        
	Two new awards were instituted this year by True Spirit Puja associate The Bengal, an NGO, saluting tradition and compassion.        
	Manicktalla Chaltabagan Lohapatti Durgapuja Committee, a multiple edition*** True Spirit Puja finalist, was the Puja that Cares while Behala Nutan Dal, a Four Star puja last year, was hailed as being True to Tradition.        
	As word got around that Mitali was the Model Puja, the crowds at Kankurgachhi swelled on Ashtami evening.        
	Away from the spotlight, a silent thanksgiving prayer could have been sent up by the thalassaemic patients who are handed injections every year by the puja organisers or the Aila victims who received relief materials or a visitor from Amherst Street who had dropped his wallet at the pandal on Saptami but got it back thanks to a volunteer.

                      Taking Beckett from stage to screen                    Widely regarded as perhaps the most influential writers of the 20th century, Samuel Beckett is considered among the last modernists and one of the key writers of Theatre of the Absurd. The entire literary output of this Irish-born playwright and novelist offers a bleak outlook on human culture, reducing basic existential problems to their most essential features. Thus, his concerns are fundamental, but never simplistic  the evanescence of life, time and eternity, the individuals sense of loneliness and alienation as a result of the impossibility of establishing genuine communication and contact with others, and the mystery of self. Hosted by The Seagull Foundation for the Arts, Beckett on Film is a festival of films based on his plays beginning today. Featuring 19 films, they have been made by an internationally established bunch of directors like Neil Jordan, Anthony Minghella and Richard Eyre, and emerging Irish directors including Damien ODonnell, Conor McPherson and John Crowley. One of the most striking aspects of these adaptations for film is not just the faithful adherence of the directors to every word and phrase in Becketts texts and stage direction, but also the sheer diversity of visual styles adopted by the filmmakers as they have approached his works for screen viewing. To be screened today is Waiting for Godot (a still from it appears here), perhaps Becketts best known absurdist work. It follows two days in the lives of two men, Vladimir and Estragon, who wait for someone named Godot, who never appears till the end.

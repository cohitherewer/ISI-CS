The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rani feels the warmth
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rani feels the warmth

	Calcutta gave Rani Mukerji a warm welcome on Thursday, but for once the queen of hearts could have done with a less warm one.        
	Its pretty warm here and I didnt expect it to be so. I was told that it was pretty cold here a few days ago, but when I landed I was surprised to find that the weather in Calcutta is like that in Mumbai, Rani told Metro.        
	She was right on both counts. The minimum temperature has climbed steadily from the one degree below normal mark of 15.4 degrees Celsius on Sunday to three degrees above normal at 17.7 degrees Celsius on Thursday.        
	The minimum temperature is quite high given the time of the year. The trend is likely to hold for another two days at least. The mercury is likely to dip again from next week, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	Meteorologists blamed a low-pressure trough over the Bay of Bengal and the reduced influence of northwesterlies for the relatively warm first week of December despite winters early onset on November 22.        
	The low-pressure trough over the Bay is adding a lot of moisture to the lower troposphere, causing misty mornings and cloud cover over some parts during the day, said Debnath. The moisture locks in heat and pushes up humidity, resulting in greater discomfort.        
	Though the maximum temperature on Thursday was normal at 28.1 degrees Celsius, the very high humidity range of 48 per cent to 100 per cent pushed the discomfort index to 59 degrees Celsius, four notches above normal.        
	The weaker flow of the cold, dry northwesterlies has contributed to the higher temperature, said O.P. Sharma, the chief meteorologist of a private Met agency.        
	Calcutta is likely to cool down after Sunday. The mercury should slide down to 15 degrees Celsius early next week, provided there are no new atmospheric formations in or around south Bengal, said a senior scientist from the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting in Noida.        
	================                          
	It seems to be as warm in Calcutta as it is in Mumbai. The flight announcement when I landed this morning said it was 27 degrees outside. Thats pretty warm for December here, isnt it?

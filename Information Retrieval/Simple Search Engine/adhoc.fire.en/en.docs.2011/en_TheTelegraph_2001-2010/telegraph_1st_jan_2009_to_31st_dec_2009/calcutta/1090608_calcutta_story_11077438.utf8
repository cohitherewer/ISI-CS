The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Wife killed after fight
                                                                                                               Wife killed after fight
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 26-year-old homemaker was murdered allegedly by her husband in their Sinthee flat early on Sunday after a fight over her going out to work.        
	Arvind Santalia, 40, who works in a different outlet of the same sari company where his wife Pinki was employed, is absconding.         
	Arvind slashed the veins in Pinkis left leg and left wrist and hit her on the forehead with a tawa (an iron utensil for making chapati), said police.        
	The couples four-year-old daughter Khusi has gone to visit an ailing relative in Rajasthan with Pinkis mother, who stays with the family in their rented ground-floor, two-room flat on Kalicharan Ghosh Road.        
	It was a gruesome murder. There was blood on the bedroom walls, the window and the curtains apart from the bed. We informed the police after Pinkis cellphone went unanswered and we found the main door locked, said a relative of the homemaker. We learnt that Arvind had a problem with Pinki going out to work but he did not earn enough to support the family. The two fought over this on Sunday night, said an officer.        
	The couple worked in a sari company owned by the in-laws of one of Pinkis sister. Arvind was irregular at work but the family was not in a financial crisis, said Pradip Singhania, one of the brothers-in-law of Pinki.        
	The owner of the flat, who lives on the floor above, told Metro that he did not hear the couple fight.

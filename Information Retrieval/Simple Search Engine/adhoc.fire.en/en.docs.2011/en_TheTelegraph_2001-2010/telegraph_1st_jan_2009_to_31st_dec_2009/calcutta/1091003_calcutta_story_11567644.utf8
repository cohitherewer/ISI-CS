The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CAS choice upsets users
                                                                                                               CAS choice upsets users
          RITH BASU                              
	The Centres decision to make the conditional access system (CAS) optional in areas where it had not been implemented has left those who were forced to switch to it fuming.        
	The yet-to-be-notified decision was confirmed by Abhijit Sanyal, the nodal officer of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai). He added that it had not been decided whether cable services would be allowed in the CAS areas.        
	Under CAS, pay channels can only be watched through a set-top box. About 3 lakh of the 25 lakh cable homes in the city are in the CAS area.        
	The average monthly bill for 45 pay channels and 35 free-to-air channels provided by city cable operators is Rs 175. The bouquet costs Rs 375 (Rs 91 for the free-to-air channels and Rs 5.25 each for the pay channels plus entertainment tax and service tax) in CAS areas.        
	The government obviously realises that there are glitches in CAS. Isnt it unjust to continue to make a group of people suffer a faulty system just because the experiment had started with them? asked Diptangshu Mitra, a resident of Shakuntala Park in Behala, which is covered under CAS.         
	Consumers in the CAS areas also complained of reception problems caused by poor-quality set-top boxes provided to them and poor service by the last mile operator.        
	The Trai guidelines allow consumers to rent set-top boxes for Rs 45 a month after a down payment of Rs 250 instead of buying them for Rs 1,200 to Rs 1,500 each but few are aware of the option.        
	CAS was meant to bring transparency and one of the reasons for its failure is that this did not go down well with broadcasters, said Mrinal Chatterjee, a former member of the Union CAS committee.        
	Cable operators declare only 30 per cent of their actual customer base. This is taken into account when the TRPs of programmes are calculated. Broadcasters of pay channels fear that they will have fewer viewers under CAS and hence will have to slash their advertisement rates, said an industry insider.        
	Dileep Singh Mehta of Cable Comm, a multi-system operator, said all the stakeholders stood to lose under CAS, which is why the system had to go.

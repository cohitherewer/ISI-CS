The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | LPG line short but officials hopeful 
                                                                                                               LPG line short but officials hopeful 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The owners of only 150 two-stroke autos registered after August 2000 applied for conversion to LPG till Monday, two days after the state government cleared the switch.         
	The Calcutta Metropolitan Area has around 10,000 autos that were registered after August 2000.         
	Monday was the first full working day since the conversion was allowed on August 1 but not many applications could be accepted as government offices closed immediately after transport minister Subhas Chakrabortys death.         
	We expect a long queue from tomorrow. Application forms have also been sent to some police stations for distribution, said an official of the public vehicles department (PVD). On Monday, officials pasted a copy of the circular allowing the conversion outside the registration office along with a copy of the application form and the documents to be submitted.         
	Only 2,800 of the 70,000-odd legal and illegal autos are fit to ply following the high court ban that came into force on Saturday. The governments conversion plan, if implemented, would result in 10,000 more three-wheelers hitting the street after being retro-fitted with LPG kits.         
	We have not fixed any deadline but the process has to be completed in 10-15 days. The auto-unions have been asked to do their bit to expedite the process, said a transport department official.         
	Converting 10,000 autos to LPG within 10-15 days means government offices processing at least 1,000 applications a day. It seems a tall order, said an official.         
	Auto operators willing to switch to LPG will have to buy a retro-fitting kit, priced Rs 10,000-15,000, from any of the 60 approved dealers in the city. The process is simple and does not take much time, said an operator.         
	nProtest: Around 1,000 members of the Auto Bachao Committee marched from the Hazra crossing to the PVDs office in Beltala demanding that all registered two-stroke autos be allowed to convert to LPG.         
	The government is changing its policy every day. How can it arbitrarily decide on a cut-off date  August 2000  while allowing conversion to LPG? asked Trinamuls Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay, who is also the leader of the Auto Bachao Committee.

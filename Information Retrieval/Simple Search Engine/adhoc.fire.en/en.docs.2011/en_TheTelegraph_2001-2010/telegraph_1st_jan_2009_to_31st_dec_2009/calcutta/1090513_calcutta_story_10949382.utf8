The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sachin inspires car owners to speak up
                                                                                                               Sachin inspires car owners to speak up
                            Sachin Halders SUV parked outside the district headquarters of South 24-Parganas				                           
	As Sachin Halder battles the Election Commission to get back his Tata Safari, citizens are speaking out against a rule that allows the poll panel to snatch any vehicle it takes a fancy to.        
	Samir Changoiwala, a resident of the city, would have had to part with his personal vehicle  an SUV that his son goes to school in  had it not developed a serious snag last month. But that did not stop officials from allegedly threatening him with penal action if he did not hand over his car within a particular date.        
	Metro, which has been fighting for Halders cause, reproduces Changoiwalas story.        
	I own a silver-coloured, air-conditioned Scorpio that is registered in the name of my company. The car is around five years old and is my only vehicle. Me and my family use it to commute every day.         
	On April 16, my wife was taking our year-old daughter to hospital for vaccination and a check-up as she was unwell. A team from the public vehicles department stopped the car on Ballygunge Circular Road and said it would be requisitioned from April 22.        
	My wife told them that it was our personal car and that she was going to a doctor. She also told them that we have a son who needs to be dropped and picked up from school every day.         
	They, however, refused to listen and misbehaved with her. They kept her waiting for 40 minutes, by which time our baby was bawling. They took away our drivers driving licence and the cars tax token without giving us a receipt.        
	After my wife returned home, my brother-in-law went to Ballygunge Circular Road and asked the official in charge of the team to acknowledge the receipt of the original driving licence and tax token. He refused. It was only after an argument with my brother-in-law that he relented.        
	On April 18, four days before I was to hand it over for election duty, my cars engine developed a problem and was sent for repairs. On April 22, I sent one of my employees and the driver to the requisitioning authority to submit papers proving that the vehicle was being repaired in a workshop. The officer threatened my driver and told him to report back to him with the car.         
	On April 29, I received a letter from the Election Commission giving me three days to communicate the reason for not sending my car for poll duty. I replied on May 2, stating the facts and attaching all the relevant documents. The letter was personally delivered to the election office on Gopalnagar Road, Alipore.         
	Around 30 minutes later I got a call from the office. The caller said he wouldnt listen to anything I had to say about why the car was unavailable and threatened me with legal action if I did not hand over the vehicle by 11am on May 3. My car is still in the workshop. There have been no calls or letters from the poll panel since.        
	The government spends crores of rupees on elections, but cant it have its own transport facilities? It can requisition commercial vehicles but spare cars meant for personal use, please.               
	Mails from other outraged readers have flooded our inbox. Here are a few:              
	Contesting the court order and forcibly keeping Sachin Halders car, which he had bought for his ailing wife but is now being used for the comfort of poll officials, amounts to violation of human rights. It questions the very purpose of elections in the largest democracy of the world.

	Sachin Haldars plight is a lesson for us. Never buy a car before an election; if you have to buy one, do not get one with a twin AC and a TV!        
	Rajesh Das        
	Sachin Haldar deserves to be congratulated for mustering the courage to fight for his rights and take on the Election Commission. I wonder if Halder will get back his vehicle in proper condition.

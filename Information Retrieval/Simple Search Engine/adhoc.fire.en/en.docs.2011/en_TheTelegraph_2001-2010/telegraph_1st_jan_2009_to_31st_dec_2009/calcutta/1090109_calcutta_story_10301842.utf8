The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Discount hope for phase-out
                                                                                                               Discount hope for phase-out

	A decision by Hindustan Motors to increase the exchange discount on old taxis is likely to facilitate the governments attempt to implement a high court order on phasing out of vehicles more than 15 years old by March 31 next year.        
	The company, which makes Ambassadors that are used as taxis, has agreed to nearly double the exchange discount following a request from the government and persistent demand from taxi operators.        
	A Hindustan Motors spokesperson refused to comment on the hike  the management is considering all possibilities, was what he would say  but a senior official in the transport department said the company had agreed to increase the discount from Rs 25,000 to Rs 45,000.        
	The hike still falls short of the taxi operators demand but they are willing to negotiate. We had asked for Rs 70,000 and will accept nothing below Rs 50,000 but are willing to discuss the issue, said the general secretary of the Bengal Taxi Association.        
	The move followed pressure from taxi operators who had last month asked the state government for permission to replace the 7,000-odd Ambassadors more than 15 years old with new Tata Indigo Marina or Maruti Suzuki Omni cabs.        
	The request followed Hindustan Motorss initial decision not to offer an exchange discount of more than Rs 25,000 on old Ambassador taxis. Taxi operators had asked for a discount of Rs 70,000 while the government had requested the company to fix it at Rs 50,000.        
	We are meeting the taxi operators and Hindustan Motors representatives in a few days to sort out matters so that the ban can be effectively enforced, the transport department official said.        
	A Hindustan Motors official said the company was considering all possibilities and would clarify its stand in a meeting with the government.         
	The transport department could also consider a sales tax waiver of about Rs 30,000 on each new taxi.        
	The government is trying to accommodate our demands. If the final package suits our terms we will accept it, said Tarak Barik, the secretary of Calcutta Taxi Association. We have also asked for a simplification of the registration formalities to avoid paying a bribe of Rs 3,000 per taxi to police for clearance, Guha told Metro.        
	To implement the ban, about 7,000 of the 42,000 taxis plying in and around the city will have to be replaced by March 31.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A junior doctor at SSKM Hospital has been showcaused for allegedly setting the wrong leg of a 94-year-old woman in traction.        
	We will suspend Surajit Kundu, a member of the house staff, if he fails to provide a satisfactory answer, said Pradip Mitra, the director of the Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research at SSKM.        
	Promila Dey, a resident of New Ballygunge, had fractured her right leg but got traction in the left on February 12. After son Rupayan lodged a complaint the other leg was hurriedly put in traction. The implant from the left leg was later surgically removed.        
	The hospital said both procedures were performed by Kundu. The decision to showcause the doctor follows a probe by a medical board.        
	Two postgraduate trainees have also been found guilty of negligence, Mitra said. The findings have been conveyed to the University of Health Science as the two are still students.        
	The probe panel exonerated Samar Gupta, the surgeon under whom Dey was admitted, as he was neither present during the procedures nor supervised them.

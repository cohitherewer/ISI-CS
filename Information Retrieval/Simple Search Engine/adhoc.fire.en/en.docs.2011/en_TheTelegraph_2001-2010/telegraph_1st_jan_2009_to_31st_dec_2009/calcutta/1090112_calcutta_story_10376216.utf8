                                                                                                               Flat robbery cracked, 3 held
          A STAFF REPORTER                                              The Shakespeare Sarani building where Hormuz Burjor Bhagwagar lives in a first-floor apartment      
	Police claimed to have identified the six men, three already under arrest, who had allegedly robbed a businessman by forcing him to sign three bearer cheques for Rs 11 lakh and hand over his credit card on Friday morning.s        
	Around Rs 9 lakh of the amount fraudulently taken out of Hormuz Burjor Bhagwagars account has been recovered from the trio, who were arrested on Sunday.         
	The sleuths, claiming to have identified the accused from the footage of the closed-circuit camera of an ATM counter, said the mastermind was Bhagwagars medicine supplier.         
	He is among the trio behind bars. He had visited the 54-year-olds Shakespeare Sarani apartment quite a few times over the past one-and-a-half year, said an officer of the detective department, refusing to name the mastermind.         
	Around Rs 9 lakh has been recovered. We are looking for three other youths who were involved in the operation, the sleuth added.        
	The police said the six had split into two groups. While the medicine supplier and two others waited on the road, the other three entered the first-floor flat of Bhagwagar in Sukh Sadan  52B Shakespeare Sarani  posing as medical representatives.         
	The trio entered the flat around 11.30am and the entire operation was over in four hours, the officer said.         
	As Bhagwagar was expecting people from his medicine supplier, who he had called on Wednesday, he told the guards of the 10-storeyed building to allow the trio inside.         
	After getting the cheques and the credit card, along with Bhagwagars personal identification number, one of the youths came down and handed them over to the mastermind, who was waiting on the road with two of his accomplices, the officer said.         
	The mastermind then sent two youths with the cheques to the bank and the other to an ATM counter with the credit card.        
	Withdrawing money from the ATM was their biggest mistake, as the counter was fitted with a closed-circuit camera. We got the photograph of the youth who withdrew the money, the officer said.         
	Bhagwagar identified the youth as one of those who had forced him to part with the cheques and the card. The youth was on our list of regular offenders, the officer added.        
	The cops zeroed in on the medicine supplier after getting his name and phone number from the businessman.

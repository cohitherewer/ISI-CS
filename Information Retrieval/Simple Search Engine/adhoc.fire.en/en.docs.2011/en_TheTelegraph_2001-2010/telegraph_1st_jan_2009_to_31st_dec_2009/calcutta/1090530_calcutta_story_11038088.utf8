The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tot test clean, ordeal on
                                                                                                               Tot test clean, ordeal on
        A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Little Gibson Biswas has tested negative for swine flu, but he isnt getting a respite from the mosquitoes, the filth and the unpalatable food at the Infectious Diseases Hospital for at least another night.         
	Mother Sushmitas throat and nasal swab reports did not arrive from New Delhi till late on Friday evening, signalling the third consecutive night of torment for the Toronto resident and her toddler since they landed in the city.        
	Sushmita, 43, and Gibson, a year and nine months old, had arrived by a Lufthansa flight at 11.15pm on Wednesday and were quarantined on being found to be coughing and running a temperature.        
	A health department official confirmed that Gibsons test reports were negative for the H1N1 virus that causes swine flu. The swab reports from Delhi show that the toddler is not suffering from swine flu. But since his mothers report has not reached us yet, they cannot be released. Her report is expected on Saturday morning, he said.        
	Sushmitas family claimed they hadnt been informed about Gibson testing negative.        
	The mother and child are being quarantined in a male ward of the Beleghata hospital that does not have even basic facilities like a clean bed and toilet.        
	The toilet is so dirty that my daughter hasnt been able to enter it despite trying several times. My grandson almost vomited on Friday afternoon because of the stench. The doctors finally acceded to Sushmitas request and allowed her to use their toilet, said Ila Dutta, Sushmitas mother.         
	Mother and son have not had a proper meal since they were quarantined. We are not allowed to provide home-cooked food and the stuff they serve there is unhygienic. My daughter and grandson have had to make do with some fruits and sweets bought by my husband, Sushmitas mother said.        
	Sushmitas father S.K. Dutta, a retired central government official, had requested the authorities to admit his daughter and grandson to a private hospital but they wouldnt budge.         
	This is the first time we are meeting our grandson, and he is having to spend nights in a dirty government hospital instead of home. He has been crying most of the time, said Dutta.        
	A senior health department official said the Infectious Diseases Hospital was the sole designated facility in the city for isolation of suspected swine flu patients.        
	But according to Sushmita, hospital staff walk in and out of the so-called isolation ward without any protective gear. If anybody tries to impose rules, the CPM-backed employees unions step in, complained a doctor.        
	There is no separate ward in the hospital for women patients who need to be quarantined. Fortunately for Sushmita and her son, no male patient with suspected swine flu has been brought in since Wednesday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | He halts Mamata in her tracks 
                                                                                                               He halts Mamata in her tracks     - Neighbourhood priest shares unique bond with political powerhouse          POULOMI BANERJEE                          Amal Chatterjee at his Harish Chatterjee Street home. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                        
	For him, Mamata Banerjees convoy screeches to a halt anytime, anywhere just so that he can place his hand on her head and bless her.        
	She is a politician, he is a priest. The neighbours share a unique bond that transcends politics and religion.        
	Meet Amal Chatterjee, or Pinu thakur, who has the power to do what Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee would give up his Gitabitan to be able to do  bring Mamata to a stop.        
	I was standing on a street at night waiting for someone recently when she saw me and immediately stopped. It was so touching. Thats her. She is very down-to-earth... power hasnt corrupted her at all, says the man in his seventies about his favourite parar meye.        
	So has the politician from 30B Harish Chatterjee Street been consulting the priest from 30/2 Harish Chatterjee Street in her race towards Writers Buildings? I have known her from the time she was born, and our relationship is not for mutual gain. We live two houses apart and our families have always known each other. She is especially fond of my wife Shipra, whom she refers to as her favourite boudi, he says.        
	Regulars at Maddox Square would know Chatterjee from his energetic arati in front of the deity, one of the top draws at the south Calcutta puja. His involvement with the Maddox Square puja is said to be the reason why  though he prefers to play this down  the Trinamul Congress chief visits the pandal almost every Ashtami to offer anjali.        
	She enquires about the anjali timings in advance so that she can work out her schedule. Although I do not oversee the regular Ashtami anjali, I do conduct a special session for her in the morning, says Chatterjee.        
	No wonder the arghya (offering to the goddess, usually floral, placed in a small red cloth covered basket) from the Maddox Square puja makes its way, religiously, to Mamatas bag. Every year after the puja, I bring six arghyas. One of these I give Mamata and tell her to keep it in her bag always, he says with a smile.                                      
	But when Mamatas nephew took ill a few years ago and the family held a Satyanarayan puja at home, they insisted that he conduct the puja. I of course did the puja and I was never in doubt that the child would recover.        
	As Amal Chatterjee, he had many years ago given up a marketing job to follow in his priest fathers footsteps. As Pinu thakur today, he has his hand on the head of the woman they call Bengals chief minister in waiting.

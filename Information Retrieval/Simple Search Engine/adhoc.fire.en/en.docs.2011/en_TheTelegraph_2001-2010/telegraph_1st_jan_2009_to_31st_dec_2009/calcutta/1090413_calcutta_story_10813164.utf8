                                                                                                               Doctors heckled
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 300-strong mob ransacked Diamond Harbour Sub-divisional Hospital and heckled the superintendent and a few other doctors on Sunday morning following the death of a 16-year-old boy.        
	The protesters blamed Bablu Dattaris death on medical negligence. Superintendent Ganesh Prasad denied the charge and lodged an FIR with Diamond Harbour police station. The patients relatives, too, filed a police complaint alleging negligence.        
	Bablu, a student of Class X, was admitted to the hospital with multiple injuries after he was hit by a van at Sarisha, 55km from Calcutta. He was brought to the hospital in a critical condition. Our doctors tried their best to save his life but the boy died at 8am on Sunday, Prasad said.        
	Sub-divisional officer S.S. Chakraborty asked Prasad to conduct a probe.

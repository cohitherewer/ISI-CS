                                                                                                               20-hr wait for helping hand
          A STAFF REPORTER                                          Vishal Shukla at hospital. (Gopal Senapati)      
	A 30-year-old hit by a bus near Howrah Maidan lay on the road for 20 hours in full view of pedestrians and traders before police took him to hospital on Monday afternoon.        
	Vishal Shukla, who arrived in the city from Siwan in Bihar on Sunday evening looking for a job, sustained a serious injury in his waist after being dashed by the bus minutes later. He is now admitted to Howrah District Hospital, 500 yards from the accident spot.        
	The man was writhing in pain on the ground, at the base of a road divider near Bankim Setu, and was praying for water in a feeble voice. We gave him water and called Howrah police station. But the cops did not turn up till 4pm on Monday, said Amit Kumar, a conductor.         
	Lying unattended for so long must have done a lot of harm to the man but no one wanted to take him to hospital because the police would have asked all sorts of questions and unnecessarily harassed us, said another conductor.        
	Drivers, traders and pedestrians who had seen the man lying on the road echoed him. They said they had seen Shukla wandering aimlessly in the area but denied witnessing the mishap, which occurred around 8pm on Sunday.        
	The police said they were not aware that a mishap victim was lying on the road. We have spoken to him and informed his family members in Bihar. A case has also been started, said Sukesh Kumar Jain, the additional superintendent of police (town).        
	Shukla told police that he could not read the route number of the bus that hit him because it was written in Bengali.

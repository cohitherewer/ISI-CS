  - Back after a year          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          German minister Philipp Rsler in the city on Thursday. Picture by Aranya Sen                                        
	Bengal seems to be back in focus of global investors with a large German business team visiting the state after a year.        
	The 30-member team from the Lower Saxony province is the first delegation from Germany since the Tata pullout from Singur dented Bengals image.        
	At least seven large business teams from various German provinces came to India in the past year but all of them gave Bengal a miss.        
	The Tata Nano pullout was a setback. But we want to look beyond that, said Wilfred Prewo, the chief executive of the Hannover Chamber of Commerce.         
	The delegation is led by Philipp Rsler, the minister for economics, labour and transport of Lower Saxony.        
	Rsler is one of the youngest ministers in Germany and is of Asian origin. He was born in Vietnam but was adopted and raised in Germany.        
	Industry observers said German businessmen were back in Bengal to seek a market with a growth potential. Germany, Western Europe and the US are in the grip of recession but the Indian economy is expected to grow at 5-6 per cent.        
	We have brought small and medium-sized groups. They want to build good business contacts here, Rsler said. He met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee for an hour on Thursday afternoon.        
	The chief minister told the delegates that he wanted more investment in the small and medium-scale sectors in Bengal and was looking forward to collaborating with German businesses. Rsler assured him of all possible help.        
	Bhattacharjee also sought Lower Saxonys help in three areas: electrical equipment for power plants, medical equipment manufacturing and tie-ups with German educational institutes, said B.G. Roy, the regional director of the Indo-German Chamber of Commerce, which facilitated the German tour.        
	One of concerns voiced by the delegation was of an inflexible bureaucracy. Rsler said bureaucracy must be avoided at all times, especially during recession. He also called for free trade with India. Economic protectionism during this time would be fatal. We are completely against it. We want to trade, Rsler said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Upgrade plans for varsity PG courses
                                                                                                               Upgrade plans for varsity PG courses
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The postgraduate education system followed by state-aided universities is set to undergo changes, which will include introduction of a teacher sharing arrangement.        
	The West Bengal Council of Higher Education, which frames all major policies related to higher education, has started drawing up a comprehensive plan to improve the standard of teaching, learning and research in every subject taught at the postgraduate level in Calcutta, Jadavpur, Rabindra Bharati and other state-aided universities.        
	There are a string of proposals to upgrade the postgraduate education system in Bengal, said Dipak Bhattacharya, the member-secretary of the higher education council.        
	One such proposal is to start a teacher exchange programme for the varsities. Each university is known to be strong in certain courses depending on its infrastructure and faculty strength. Since the institutions are run with state assistance, the government feels students of one campus should be allowed to use the facilities of another, said an official.        
	For instance, a particular university may have some renowned teachers in chemical engineering while another may be strong in applied mathematics. Once the faculty sharing arrangement is in place, the institutions may share their teachers of chemical engineering and applied mathematics with each other for a brief period every session, the official explained.        
	Apart from faculty exchange, there is also a proposal for sharing of research facilities, under which students of one university will be able attend classes or conduct research in another institution.        
	An official said the council would thoroughly examine the syllabi and examination systems followed by various universities at the postgraduate level.        
	Once the government approves the proposals, the council will start out drawing up a detailed upgrade plan for the postgraduate courses in history in the aided universities, said an official.        
	The council had called a meeting last Friday of the senior teachers of history of Calcutta, Jadavpur, Burdwan and Vidyasagar universities to discuss ways to improve the standard of teaching, learning and research in the subject.        
	The meeting could not be held because of the transport strike.        
	Though the council will prepare the final recommendations, teachers of the departments concerned will have to draw up the initial roadmap for upgrading the postgraduate education system, said an official of the council.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Six weeks for Manna report
                                                                                                               Six weeks for Manna report
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Monday gave the CID six weeks to report its progress in the Arindam Manna death probe. The GRP sub-inspectors body was found beside the railway tracks in Sheoraphuli on February 11.        
	Justice Sanjib Banerjee issued the directive following a plea for a CBI probe by Mannas parents and submission by CID counsel Nisith Adhikari.        
	On March 17, Mannas parents Ashok and Malati Manna had filed a petition in the high court demanding a CBI probe into their sons death. Moving the petition on Monday, their counsel Chaitali Bhattacharya said her clients had no faith in the CID.         
	My clients do not believe the CID will conduct a fair probe into sub-inspectors death. Though briefly, Manna had probed Rizwanur Rahmans death. He was a witness in the case and there was a possibility of him getting murdered, she submitted.        
	Considering the gravity of the case, the court should hand over the probe to a central investigating agency, such as the CBI.        
	CID counsel Adhikari told the court that his client had almost completed the probe. It will not be wise to take the case from the CID at this stage and hand it over to the CBI, he said.        
	He also submitted that if the court granted time, the CID could table a progress report on the inquiry. After hearing both sides, the judge gave six weeks to the CID to submit the report and fixed the next hearing in June.

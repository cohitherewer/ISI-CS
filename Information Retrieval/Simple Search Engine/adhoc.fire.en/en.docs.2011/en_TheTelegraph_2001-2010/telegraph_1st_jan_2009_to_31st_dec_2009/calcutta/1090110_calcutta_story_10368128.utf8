	Ninety more management aspirants will make it to the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta this year.        
	The student strength will go up on the Joka campus to accommodate the second phase of the Other Backward Classes (OBC) reservation.         
	In 2008, the institute had implemented 3 per cent of the 27 per cent OBC quota. The remaining 9 per cent will be implemented in the next academic year.         
	We will increase the intake of OBC and general students by 15 per cent each. We want to admit 408 students from the 1,242 aspirants who have been called for group discussions and personal interviews, said Saibal Chattopadhyay, the dean (programme initiatives) of the Joka institute.        
	Students in the general category who meet the 98.97 percentile cut-off have been called for the second round of screening.         
	The cut-off percentile for OBC candidates is 94.44.        
	The institute from this year will also take into account the work experience of students applying for the postgraduate diploma in computer-aided management course. Those with more than 36 months of experience will be awarded four marks and those associated with information technology and IT-enabled services will be awarded an extra mark.        
	The curriculum for the computer-aided management course has been overhauled and we need suitable candidates, said admissions chairman Subrata Mitra.        
	The cut off marks for the math and data interpretation sections have been set at 38. For verbal ability, its 51.

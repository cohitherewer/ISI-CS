                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Enamelled beauties
										      flashback                        A collage of Mudar Patheryas collection of porcelain enamel signboards that speak for themselves. Pictures by Aranya Sen				                           
	Parimal Ray of Beltala had set the trend of collecting porcelain enamel advertising in Calcutta. Ray has been collecting for decades and has already held an exhibition in Santiniketan. An exhibition of his collection of original artwork for ads dating back to early 20th century will open soon.        
	Ray has inspired a younger collector, Mudar Patherya to wit, to gather about 300 porcelain enamel signboards, mostly belonging to early or mid-20th century. Unlike Ray, who like a magpie had spotted these street signs and bought them before they were discarded, Patherya mostly depends on antique dealers, who have realised that these have turned into collectibles. They cost anything between Rs 500 and a couple of thousands.        
	Whatever the source, this is a fascinating collection, and although many of them are of recent vintage, the older ones throw light on advertising copy, design and typography of those times. So, in a way, it amounts to visualising advertising history.        
	The products being promoted range from daily newspapers, a sports magazine in Bengali, cameras, film and soaps and snuff to vinyl records, a popular health drink (Horlicks), kerosene, hurricane lanterns, matchboxes (Tekka) and tea. Many of these products are either not available any longer or their brand image has undergone a sea change. Many of these companies have folded up, although people of a certain age are still familiar with them  Lily Biscuit, Caltex kerosene and Esso. Some have come full circle  Allianz Und Stuttgarten Life Insurance Bank Ltd is back in a new avatar.        
	A particular one advertising Alpines Pure dairy amp; Farm, Agarpara, takes us back to BN Elias amp; Co Ltd and its extensive estate comprising a jute mill and tobacco factory next to Kamarhati on Barrackpore Trunk Road, among other properties. There is a scrap of old Calcutta too  a signboard of Butto Kristo Pauls Edwards Tonic touted as the panacea for an entire range of ailments, including malaria. Such signboards can still be spotted in Butto Kristo Pauls quaint drugstore in Sovabazar Street. A swadeshi music company, Megaphone, flaunts its Indian capital, labour and management. Such signboards were displayed on trams. The ads for the dailies were hung from the bicycles of newspaper vendors. India Cycle Products of the Indian Cycle Manufacturing Company exhorts the public to buy swadeshi. Warrior cycles of Sen amp; Pandit, Calcutta, were available in Rangoon (Yangon) as well.        
	Most of the signboards are either in solid mono or duotone, save the one for Nasco washing soap in four-colour.        
	A giant HMV signboard with the trademark featuring Nipper the dog before the gramophone is there, but there is another strip of porcelain enamel with His Masters Voice in Bengali script, one of the many such in the vernacular. The weekly Barrackpore Dhwani was available for 20 paise per issue. The advertisements for Sree Ghee, Ganesh brand mustard oil, Annapurna Debi Ghee, Byayam Charcha (the only Bengali monthly fitness magazine) are all in Bengali as well.         
	So is another notice of the Calcutta Advertising Agency to the effect that bills should not be pasted on walls without permission. Bengal Enamels utensils are advertised both in English and Bengali. The notice meant for a womens restroom is in Hindi, while a street sign for Al-Salam Street is in Arabic. Not surprising, for Google says the street is in Abu Dhabi. How did it get to Calcutta?        
	One of the most interesting notices, dated April 1, 1957, introduces the new rates of exchange for what was known as naya paisa at one time.         
	All the signboards are not in mint condition but this is an invaluable collection as production of porcelain enamel advertising stopped way back in the 1960s.       SOUMITRA DAS

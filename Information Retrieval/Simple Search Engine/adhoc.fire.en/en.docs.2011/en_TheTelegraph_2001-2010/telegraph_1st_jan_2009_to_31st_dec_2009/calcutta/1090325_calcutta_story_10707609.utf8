The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Protest shield for killer drivers
                                                                                                               Protest shield for killer drivers
          A STAFF REPORTER                                      
	City cops have bowed to political pressure in dealing with killer drivers, unlike their counterparts in Howrah, Hooghly and the two 24-Parganas.        
	Yielding to protests by Citu-supported bus operators, Calcutta police have gone back on their decision to charge rogue drivers with culpable homicide not amounting to murder (IPC Section 304), a non-bailable offence.        
	Instead, the cops are booking such drivers for causing death by negligence, a bailable offence under Section 304A.        
	Section 304 carries the maximum punishment of life-imprisonment and 304A, two years in jail.        
	Records available with the city police reveal that five killer drivers have been booked under Section 304 in the past three months. The number of road deaths during the period is close to a hundred .        
	Records with the traffic department of the state police show that 83 bus drivers were booked in December 2008 and 125 in January under the non-bailable section. In February, 101 drivers were slapped with the charge. An officer said 70 per cent of the arrests were made in the four districts.        
	We are just implementing the provisions in the lawbook, said D.P. Tarenia, the inspector general (traffic) of the state police.        
	We are not slapping the the non-bailable charge on the drivers immediately after they are arrested. If we are convinced that the death resulted from rash driving, we are invoking it.        
	It was the state police that first decided to invoke the non-bailable section to curb rash driving. The city cops followed suit in October, only to get cold feet within a month.        
	A series of bus strikes called by the Citu prompted Lalbazar to go soft on the drive. Later, the government formed a committee to gauge the mood on the issue.         
	An officer of the city traffic police said: We are waiting for the state to finalise its strategy. If we are asked to, we will follow in the footsteps of our counterparts in the districts.         
	Assessing the public mood, however, was the last thing on the minds of the state cops. There is a provision in the lawbook and we are enforcing it, said an officer in a neighbouring district.

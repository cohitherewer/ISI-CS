                                                                                                               Five held for theft
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Five youths were arrested on Friday on the charge of stealing Rs 25 lakh from an office on Ganesh Chandra Avenue in central Calcutta on Wednesday night.        
	We arrested five persons, including an employee of the company, and recovered Rs 23,10,000, said an officer of the detective department.        
	The five were picked up from Chetla following a complaint by Prakash Roy, the director of Galore Supply Private Ltd, a non-banking finance company.        
	Nandu Kahar, 26, was the mastermind. He was a peon at Galore Supply, the officer said.        
	A probe revealed that Nandu, a resident of Chetla, had planned the robbery with his friends a month ago. Armed with hammers and duplicate keys, the five entered the highrise  Commerce House  around 10.30pm and took the elevator to the eighth floor. They entered the office after breaking open the main gate, the officer said.        
	The gang broke the vault and collected the cash in a leather bag. Before leaving, they ransacked the office. They came out around midnight, hired a cab and returned to Chetla, the officer added.        
	The next morning, the director and employees of Galore Supply found the main door ajar. Roy lodged a complaint with Bowbazar police station.        
	The director first told us that Rs 5 lakh had been stolen but later said the amount could be around Rs 25,00,000, the officer added.        
	Nandu told the cops during interrogation that the desire to make some quick money prompted him to plot the crime. Two of his accomplices worked in a garage and the other two in a grocery shop in Chetla.        
	They had decided to flee to Mumbai and start a business, the officer added.

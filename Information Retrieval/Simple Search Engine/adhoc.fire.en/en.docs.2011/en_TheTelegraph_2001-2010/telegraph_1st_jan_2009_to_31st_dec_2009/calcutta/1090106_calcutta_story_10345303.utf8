                      Moms and harlots                    A sharply intelligent and compassionate exploration of an east Indian social reality, Mothers for Sale: Women in Kolkatas Sex Trade (written by Indrani Sinha and Shamita Das Dasgupta) is notable for its unblinking examination of the complexity and thickness of local culture. With deep insight and in-depth study, the authors have pointed out what the state, community and society should do to ensure the welfare and safeguard the human rights of sex workers. Based on information culled from more than 750 sex workers, including child prostitutes and 300 children of sex workers in the city, it focuses on the lives of mothers involved in the sex trade. It highlights the aspirations and fears, joys and disappointments, triumphs and failures that sex workers share with all mothers. Attempting to offer an understanding of sex workers as mothers, the work goes beyond the current debate on the viability and legitimacy of sex work for women. It also sets the local experience of these women and their children in the context of the global, emphasising their lack of resources and recourses in a patriarchal world. The books official launch this evening will graced by the presence of several distinguished guests from the literary, social and entertainment world.

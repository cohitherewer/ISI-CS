The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Coloured with mother love
                                                                                                               Coloured with mother love
										      eyewitness                        Works by Somnath Hore				                                 
	Somnath Hores account of the Tebhaga movement is well known. Seagull Foundation for the Arts has released a beautifully produced version of The Tea-Garden Journal, that, apart from the text, has the sketches the artist had done in 1947.         
	These sketches, similar to the ones that document the Tebhaga movement, show the tea garden labourers, their leaders, wives and families amid the verdant setting of the hills where these bushes were planted. The older women look careworn, while the younger ones are buxom, and some are radiantly pretty.         
	While many of the figures are impromptu creations, he employs dramatic chiaroscuro to depict the heads of some men, as intense looking as Manik Bandyopadhyay.         
	These drawings are displayed at the exhibition organised at the Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre.        
	Apart from the sculptures displayed on the groundfloor, Somnath Hores drawings and watercolours of 1994 and 1997 are displayed on the first floor. Unlike the forked animals driven to despair and desperation by hunger and the violence of his bronzes, these watercolours and drawings are at the opposite end of the emotional spectrum. Expressive of mother love, they have a lightness of touch and a softness, a quality that this artist rarely displays.        
	While red, blue and yellow with splashes of black dominate the pages from the sketchbook of 1997 with their anguished faces and atmosphere of fear, the mother-and-child series is coloured in the softest of greys and light orange in keeping with the melting sentiments.         
	As in the sculptures, the large head of the mother is juxtaposed with the tiny oval head of a baby. The women, some nude, clutch and kiss the babies and hold them to their breasts in a display of warmth and tenderness.         
	Only Jesus has a careworn face while Mary is old and has a furrowed face. While these sketches are marked by the joys of nurturing, the watercolours in this series are overshadowed by the sadness of blue with touches of red. These paintings with a woman holding a rooster and overlapping faces of babies are surprisingly in European modernist tradition, in striking contrast with his sculptures and their aesthetics stemming from the wound and scars of the mind and the body.       SD

                      Music in his veins                    Alegend in the world of Hindustani classical music, Ustad Alauddin Khan introduced this form of music to the Western world, thus opening up to that part of the world a new musical horizon. Known as Baba to music-lovers in India and other countries of South Asia, he is revered as a saint and considered an institution. He established a distinctive sangeet gharana of his own, the Maihar gharana. The story of Boro Baba (a name by which author Sahana Gupta fondly addresses her great-grandfather Ustad Alauddin Khan), Ustad Alauddin Khan is the story of a simple man who dedicated his life to attain oneness with God through different forms of music. The author draws the story of his life from his handwritten manuscript, photographs and letters, painstakingly archived by her father and Babas grandson, Dhyanesh Khan. In the process, she takes us through his chequered and fascinating life  from the time he survived on alms just to learn music, to his achieving the status of a maestro. The book is a tribute to a legend, an attempt to reflect on the life of a man whose unparalleled ambition, will-power, dedication and discipline placed him among the finest musicians of the world. This evening, Ustad Aashish Khan, grandson of Baba Alauddin, will release the book. On the occasion, Shiraz Ali Khan, great-grandson of Baba Alauddin and brother of the author, will present a sarod recital. Hosted by Roli Books and Oxford Bookstore, Calcutta.

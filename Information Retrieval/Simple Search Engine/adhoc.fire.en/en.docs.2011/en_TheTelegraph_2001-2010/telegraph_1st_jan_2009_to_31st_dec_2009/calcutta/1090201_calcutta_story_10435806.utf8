The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A play-ful time in print
                                                                                                               A play-ful time in print
                                          
	Among theatre books to look out for at the Book Fair could be Bhairaver Boli  a five-act Tagore play brought out as a book for the first time by Dey Book Stores (picture left). Says editor Amritasudan Bhattacharya: The play was part of Tagores constant efforts to better his play Raja O Rani, which continued beyond Bhairaver Boli right up to Tapati.         
	Another notable book would be Sambhu Mitras controversial Abhinoy Natak Mancha, withdrawn soon after its first appearance. It is being published by Saptarshi Prakashan after 41 years with an introduction by Shaoli Mitra .        
	Of Bijon Bhattachryas plays so far only Nabanna and Debigarjan were available in print, said Sudhangshu Shekar Dey of Deys Publishing, but now they have compiled 11 of his best works.         
	Deys is also printing Ramayani Mahabharati, a compilation of Aswathama, Takshak, Ja Nei Bharatey and the new Bhelai Bhashey Sita by Manoj Mitra, with a prologue by Shamik Bandyopadhyay.        
	For theatre scholars, there are books like Stanislavskis views on acting and Jogesh Chandras contributions on stage (Saptarshi). Bagbazar Reading Library has come up with an anthology of writings, among which is Mayuri Ghoshs doctoral thesis on 19th century theatre and the Bengali middle class.        
	Short plays, especially comedies, are in great demand, says Sourav Banerjee of Kalabhrit (Nabagrantha Kuthir) which will club Manoj Mitras Kenaram Becahram, Dampati and Mesh O Rakhash in one book and nine plays of Soumitra Basu as Mancher Opekkhay.         
	The number of plays included gives the anthologies interesting titles as in Chandan Sens Barota (12 short comedies), Jyotishman Chattopadhyays Saptokando (seven shorts), Mohit Chattopadhyay Dashorupak (10 shorts). Among full length plays are three by Soumitra Basu  Yajati, Shani Mangal and Purbo Nirdharita (Kalabhrit)  Arpita Ghoshs Tokolosh (Saptarshi Prakashan), Bratya Basus Krishnagauvar (Abhijan publishers) and the English translation of Shibaji Bandyopadhyays Uttam Purush Ek Bachan (Seagull books).                          SEBANTI SARKAR

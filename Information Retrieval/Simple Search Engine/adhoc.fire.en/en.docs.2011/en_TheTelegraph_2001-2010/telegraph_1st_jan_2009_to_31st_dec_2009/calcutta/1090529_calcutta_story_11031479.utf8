The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | GenX loses heart to Messi at midnight
                                                                                                               GenX loses heart to Messi at midnight
  - Oh-so-cute Barcelona magician steals sexy Ronaldos crown as citys favourite          A STAFF REPORTER                          HE IS OUR HERO: Lionel Messi in his moment of triumph against Manchester United. (AFP)                                        
	On the other side of midnight, young Calcutta found a new love. Lionel Andrs Messi.        
	This is the first football match I stayed up to watch, only for Messi, said Bulbul, 13, who fell asleep in front of the TV soon after her hero headed in Barcelonas winner against Manchester United late on Wednesday.        
	The teenager, like many other Messi fans, was outnumbered at kick-off, with her mother and most of her friends rooting for Ronaldo. But after 90 minutes of magic in Rome, Messi was the king of Europe and his devotees in distant Calcutta were on top of the world.        
	Messi is our new hero, announced Ananya Ghosh, 22, after catching every move of her man (who turns 22 in a month) on the big screen at Roxy. At the nightclubs screening the Champions League final, you were either with Cristiano Ronaldo or with Lionel Messi. And more girls seemed to go with oh-so-cute Messi than with sexy Ronaldo.        
	As Ronaldo fumbled and fumed, Messi soared and scored. He is just 57, but a real giant among footballers, gaped Vinayak Sen, 19, mesmerised by Messi on the giant screen at The Astors Plush.        
	No wonder the man anointed successor by a certain Diego Maradona, is now the most wanted at Maidan market, the pocket-friendly haunt of the soccer crazy. Till Wednesday the Ronaldo number 7 was the hot-seller but all of a sudden everyones wanting Messis number 10. We sold 40 and then ran out of stock. Weve placed a bulk order of 200 Messi jerseys of local make and 100 to be imported from Thailand, said shopkeeper Ashraf Ali.        
	That is a trend the branded addresses too are banking on. Manchester United shirts are the most popular football jerseys, with Ronaldo (followed by Rooney) as the pop pick. But now, we anticipate a jump in the demand for Lionel Messi in Barcelona colours, said Debasish Halder, the retail manager of SSIPL that partners Nike in providing products to six stores in town.        
	ManU maniacs like Shaket Banerjee, 18, may not agree, but Messi now wears the crown of Calcuttas soccer king.

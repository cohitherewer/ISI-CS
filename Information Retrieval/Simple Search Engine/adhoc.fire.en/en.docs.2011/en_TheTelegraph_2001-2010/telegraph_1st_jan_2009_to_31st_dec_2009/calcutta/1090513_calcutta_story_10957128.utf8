The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Contempt notice on car-snatch officer
                                                                                                               Contempt notice on car-snatch officer
  - Sachin takes guard for fresh court battle          OUR BUREAU                                              
	Calcutta High Court has slapped a contempt notice on the election officer who defied its order and refused to return Sachin Halders forcibly requisitioned Tata Safari.        
	Justice Sanjib Banerjee admitted a contempt petition filed by Halders lawyer on Tuesday and asked the sub-divisional officer (SDO) of Canning, Md Shahid, to make a personal appearance on May 22 to explain why he had not returned the vehicle immediately after receiving a copy of the order.        
	If held guilty of contempt of court, the officer will be liable for up to one years imprisonment, a fine of Rs 5,000 or both, said criminal lawyer Uday Shankar Chatterjee.        
	The single-judge bench of Justice Banerjee had issued the order to return Halders vehicle on May 4, but the SDO decided to contest it and moved a division bench last week.        
	Government counsel Subrata Mukhopadhyay even questioned the courts jurisdiction in an electoral matter. We have no intention of disobeying the court order. But in our view the order passed by Justice Banerjee was incorrect. Once the electoral process has begun, the high court has no jurisdiction in a case involving the Election Commission, he said.        
	The mint-green SUV that Halder had bought for his wife a month ago remains on election duty, having covered around 3,000km in three weeks since it was requisitioned on April 23.        
	Halder, who has had to hire a car for wife Gayatri to visit a dermatologist every week for treatment of her chronic skin ailment  exposure to the sun causes red blotches on her skin  said he would continue to pursue the case even if he got back his car in the next few days.        
	I will move the Supreme Court, if need be, he told Metro.        
	Halder has been hailed as a hero for standing up to the bully-boy tactics of the Election Commission, which uses Section 160 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, to requisition any vehicle or premises for poll purposes.        
	The lawyer representing the South 24-Parganas administration, D.P. Majumdar, had on Tuesday argued that Halders contempt petition was null and void because the case had moved to a division bench. The Canning residents counsel, Dipankar Basu, countered that by stating that the SDOs appeal had not come up for hearing yet.        
	While ruling in favour of Halder, the high court had observed that requisitioning a private vehicle meant for personal use was contrary to the Representation of the People Act.        
	Halder, a trader who also owns a bus and two mini-trucks, commutes mostly by a Yamaha motorcycle. But his schoolteacher wife needs a car on most days, especially when she has to visit her doctors clinic 27km from home.        
	He had requested the SDO for an exemption on special grounds, which was turned down. The Tata Safari, which replaced the Tata Sumo that Halder sold off sometime back, has been on election duty with driver Munna Sheikh at the wheel ever since.

          OUR BUREAU                           Anirbans aunt Jharna Chandra being taken to court. (Sanat Kr Sinha)                                  
	Police arrested another directors of dud IT firm INFOGEN Global on Monday even as the high court rejected the anticipatory bail plea of its absconding founder, Anirban Ghosh.        
	Jaya Ghosh, the director to be arrested on Monday, is Anirbans mother. Jaya, 50, was held in her Kalagachhia residence and produced in the court of additional chief judicial magistrate Ramesh Kumar Pradhan and remanded in police custody till March 12.        
	Anirban has been absconding since police started an investigation after receiving complaints that the company had duped hundreds of young trainees and job aspirants in Bengal and Orissa by collecting Rs 50,000 from each as a security deposit.        
	A division bench of the high court comprising Justice P.K. Chattopadhyay and Justice A.K. Roy refused Anirbans bail plea after the public prosecutor explained how the company duped hundreds of youths.         
	The employees have also lodged an FIR alleging that Ghosh did not pay their salaries, public prosecutor Ashimesh Goswami told the court.        
	The police believe Jaya holds the key to nabbing Anirban. Charges of misappropriation of fund and cheating have been framed against her. We demanded police custody to interrogate her and gather details about her son and the other directors, said an officer.        
	The ACJMs court on Monday also rejected the bail plea of Jharna Chandra  another director of the tech firm and Jayas sister  who was arrested in February. The court sent her to judicial custody till March 16.        
	Local people helped the police to arrest Jaya on Monday.         
	When we saw Jaya entering her house, we blocked the entrance and called the cops, said a neighbour. The residents also complained that Jaya had cheated many in the locality through two fraud NGOs  Pallysathi and Nari Kalyan Kendra.         
	According to them, Anirban and his wife Debarchana had fled to Burdwan in a private car hired from a local car rental service.        
	Essar International, which had supplied computers to INFOGEN Global, has also accused the firm of fraud.         
	The company owes us over Rs 4,50,000. When we went to bring back our computers, we found many parts missing, said a representative of Essar International.

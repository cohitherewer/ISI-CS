The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rear-ing to go amp; how!   Butt seriously, shes gone hip
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rear-ing to go amp; how!     - Gluteoplasty catches on among hip women in town          MOHUA DAS                          Role model: Jennifer Lopez                                        
	Butt seriously, theres something growing on women in Calcutta. The idea of getting a butt job, that is.        
	Tailing the news of the death of an ex-Miss Argentina in Buenos Aires following a gluteoplasty (plastic surgery on the posterior), Metro got a glimpse of a trend still under wraps but one thats shaping up slow and steady.        
	Gluteoplasty is more popular in Mumbai and Delhi but it is catching on in Calcutta. More women are enquiring about it and theres been a 30 per cent increase in cases, especially among those from the world of showbiz, says Dr Anupam Golash, a plastic surgeon at CMRI.        
	The butt-job brigade comprises women in the 20-to-35 age bracket in town, who visit the chamber armed with photos ripped off magazines or a vivid description of what they want. They come to me completely aware of the entire procedure, its pros and cons. They all want fuller buttocks to look curvier in fashionable, figure-hugging clothes, adds Golash.        
	A JLo rear  or the promise of one  comes for anything between Rs 50,000 and Rs 1 lakh, depending on the time taken for the procedure (30 minutes to 180 minutes) and the size of implants.        
	For those still behind the cosmetic line, gluteoplasty is the process of surgically adjusting local tissues to enhance and reshape buttocks for a firm and perky look. One method involves the use of ones own tissues, taken from the tummy or thighs, and the other is through implants.                                
	Implants are lifelong and cost more while fat injections are not permanent. One has to keep adding on in gaps of six months since 50 per cent of the fat gets absorbed, explains cosmetic surgeon Manoj Khanna.        
	Implants are safer since there are no chances of pulmonary embolism (that killed ex-Miss Argentina Solange Magnano) but people prefer fat injections as it doesnt involve foreign bodies, adds Khanna, who has a long list of celebrity clients for various procedures.        
	The risk factor of gluteoplasty, stress Golash and Khanna, is low.        
	The one reason why the butt job trend could grow fast in town is the cost factor. Calcutta may still be playing catching up with a Mumbai or a Delhi, but it is the cheapest option when it comes to cosmetic surgery. I got a call from a Bengali model based in Mumbai two weeks ago asking for a date in December for butt enhancement, says Golash.                                                              
	 A better hip makes a girl look nicer in jeans or a sari. Models want a butt like JLo but they usually get a good trainer, do lower body exercises and tone it up. And Bengali girls are any way well-endowed

	I dont think our industry needs gluteoplasty. These days a lot of padded innerwear is available that many opt for. That is safer for making a fashion statement than going under the knife

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Anarchy lurks in corner
                                                                                                               Anarchy lurks in corner
										      eyewitness                        A sculpture by Hema Upadhyay at Bose Pacia and (below) Tapati Chowdhurys Netorous				                                 
	It has become commonplace for contemporary artists to arrogate to themselves well-known works in fragments if not in whole.         
	So it does not come as a surprise that Hema Upadhyay has reproduced wholesale the geometric designs of Tibetan carpets as the backdrops of her works in her show titled Yours Sincerely, now on at Bose Pacia gallery.         
	The harmony and beauty of these designs suggestive of paradisiacal joy are in stark contrast with the huddled figures of male and female mannequins hanging from their throats and bound together like prisoners or souls in a limbo.         
	Along with these painted images is the figure of a woman in white hanging from the same strands of thread, perhaps of the artist herself. Without any artists statement to go by, one can, however, look at her sculpture of the dystopic metropolis for a clue.         
	This is a map of a city complete with a vast shantytown that threatens to devour the highrise buildings and places of worship dotting the urban sprawl.         
	One does not need to take a close look at the map to discover that sections of tin hutments and tall buildings are battered, as if they have experienced a cataclysm.         
	An unknown catastrophe has hit the dolls city with its perfectly shaped tin-roofed huts and concrete buildings. Things have gone topsy-turvy. It is the same with her paintings. Anarchy is always lurking in the corner.        
	Some of the participants of the Ichapore Artist Circles recent exhibition at the Academy of Fine Arts in spite of living on the fringes of the city were quite as talented as some of their counterparts in the rest of the city.         
	There were quite a few participants as in most group exhibitions. Reason enough for the better works to be overwhelmed. Prabal C. Borals horse with an old, bald, pot-bellied naked man sitting with a gun on it was one such. Kingshuk Bhattacharyas self-portrait with a beard and Ujjal Chakrabortys collage deserved better display and more attention.              
	The colossal Art Against Terrorism series of exhibitions is yet to be over and viewers must be by now weary of taking in volumes of mostly not very aesthetically inspiring pieces of work.         
	The only work worth a second look at Gallery Sanskriti was Jaya Gangulys horrific, flabby, grotesque face with a gaping mouth about to let out a yell. But this is the forte of this artist. The installations were pathetic, the artists creating realistic theatre sets instead.         
	Snehasish Maitys time bomb inside a pressure cooker and Timir Brahmas smart superhuman being from a comic strip stood out at K2 because of a certain coherence of thinking.         
	Katayun Saklats piece on domestic violence was too pretty, in spite of all the gore. Shakila has a mind of her own. And this was clear from her bride and the moon.         
	Emami Chisel enjoys the luxury of space and made good use of it. There are videos from Vivan Sundaram (documentation of a Sahmat exhibition) and Pushpamala.         
	Binu Bhaskars photographs with covered faces enacting the Pieta highlighted the fear and anxiety of our times. Tapati Chowdhury has created Netorous, a magical suit of clothing she has fashioned out of chicken wire, thread and fabric. It is a slick and compact piece, and this entire series should have followed her example of sparseness.       SOUMITRA DAS

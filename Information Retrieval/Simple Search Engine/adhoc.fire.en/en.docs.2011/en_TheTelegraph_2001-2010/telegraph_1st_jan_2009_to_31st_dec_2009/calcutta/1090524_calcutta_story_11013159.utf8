The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Officers and historians of Oriental past
                                                                                                               Officers and historians of Oriental past
										      book bazaar                        (From left) Bharati Ray, Achala Moulik and Barun De at the launch of Dialogues of Civilization  William Jones and Orientalists; (right) a page from the Gitanjali facsimile				                           
	Mohandas Moses and Achala Moulik, a husband-wife team of civil servants-cum-academicians, did their jobs in the daytime and spent their evenings in the portals of Asiatic Society to chronicle one of the most fascinating histories of British imperialism. Dialogues of Civilization  William Jones and Orientalists is an account of the movement that began in 1784 led by Warren Hastings and Sir William Jones to rediscover the civilisation of India.         
	Launching the book at Oxford Bookstore recently, historian Barun De lauded Mouliks effort. As a dynamic administrator who infused new life into the Archaeological Survey of India, she still found time to engage in academics and finish her late husbands colossal and critical volume, said De.         
	Moses, he said, while serving as the managing director of the Food Corporation of India, had delved into this great Orientalist project of the western discovery of India. European enlightenment sought to come to terms with the wonder that was India, said De of the project.         
	Bharati Ray, who introduced the book, expressed the doubt about the purpose of Jones and the Orientalists in seeking the cultural roots of a colonised people, particularly in the heyday of imperialist aggression.         
	Achala Moulik put it succinctly when she said: Jones reminds us of a man who after ravishing a woman wants to know her soul.         
	Gitanjali manuscript         
	William Rothenstein was an artist in London born into a Jewish family. He was also a close friend of Rabindranath Tagore. So close were they as friends that Rabindranath had dedicated his Gitanjali to him. This offering of poems was to win Tagore the Nobel prize in 1913, a year after its publication. Rothenstein had preserved the first notebook of Tagores translation of his own poems, while the second remained with the poet.         
	Sahitya Samsad has recently published a facsimile edition of the latter, compiled and arranged by Abhik Kumar Dey, according to whom, Tagore scholars worldwide, however, affirm the first notebook to be the pioneer, which is presently in the custody of Houghton Library of Harvard University, among the Rothenstein papers.        
	Gitanjali was published in 1910, and while Tagore was convalescing at Shelidah on the banks of the Padma river, now in Bangladesh, he had started translating it even before setting sail for England. The present publication is a photocopy of the manuscript.        
	The Bengali originals and their translations, about which Rothenstein was so enthusiastic, are published side by side. There are several standalone pages in English alone. An index of first lines increases the value of this edition for scholars. It is beautifully bound in burgundy.         
	Governance guide         
	With the country just recovering from the polls, The Intelligent Persons Guide to Good Governance, a book authored by academicians Surendra Munshi, Biju Paul Abraham and Soma Chaudhuri, is perhaps timely. Launched at the Oxford Bookstore recently by governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi, who along with Bharati Ray, Krishna Bose, Russy Modi and Rita Bhimani, participated in an interactive session.         
	For the governor, good governance would be one that could tackle the three issues of global meltdown, global terrorism and global warming.         
	US consul-general Beth A. Payne, who has held posts in Iraq and Rwanda, said the guide posed more questions than it answered. Pradip Bose, a retired professor of sociology from the Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, rounded off the discussion with his talk on civil society. A well-governed event.

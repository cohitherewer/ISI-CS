                      Imprints of everyday life        Technological innovations have brought about radical changes in the art of printmaking in the last decade or so. Nevertheless, its traditional form still survives in the hands of diligent printmakers like Chaita Basu Jena, who has willingly made the drudgery, that this art style involves, her vocation. Deriving joy from the long, monotonous process of printmaking, she believes that it also enables her to discover and understand her true self. Her works are usually inspired by nature and its elements as she comes across them in her daily life. Instead of picturising lush, idyllic countryside scenes that are the stuff of fairy tales and legends, she recreates nature in its more real aspects; a bird perched on a tree, a pet waiting at her doorstep, a flower blossoming in the garden or dry leaves being blown away by a breeze. Ultimately, the simplicity of her pictorial ingredients brings home the truth that art is entwined in and thrives in our daily lives more than we realise it ourselves.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Garbage roadblock
                                                                                                               Garbage roadblock
          ONTHESPOT - DUM DUM MARKET                          Garbage piles up beside the Dum Dum Co-operative New Market even after the CMCs clearance service in the morning. Picture by Rashbehari Das                                  
	The huge mound of garbage adjoining Dum Dum Co-operative New Market on Dum Dum Road is a major hindrance for traffic and pedestrian movement but talk of a solution only triggers a blame game between the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and local shopkeepers.         
	While shopkeepers complain the conservancy workers dont collect the trash on a daily basis, the civic authorities allege the shopkeepers of Dum Dum Amrita Bazaar  a hub of fish, vegetable and fruit trade  contribute to the problem by throwing their litter on the road instead of into the bin.         
	Peeve point: The vat, covering about 150 sq ft, is cleaned by civic workers once early in the morning but litter piles up within hours, as the vendors of Dum Dum market, hawkers squatting on Dum Dum Road and ceremony houses in BK Paul Lane dump waste almost round-the-clock.         
	The mound rises during the day and eats up a good part of the road by the afternoon, crippling traffic on the Dum Dum Road underpass. Add to that the stink of decaying vegetables and the swarm of flies and mosquitoes.        
	We have to live with the constant stink. Many customers steer clear of our shops and those who drop by dont like to wait too long. Even after the spot is cleaned, some of the garbage is always left behind, said Sudip Debnath, who runs a garment shop in the Co-operative New Market.        
	At times the garbage reaches my shop and the stink and mosquitoes make it unbearable to stay in the shop, added Mita Das of Book Centre at 14A Dum Dum Road.         
	Lakshman Sen, the secretary of Dum Dum Amrita Bazaar Byabasayi Samity, passed the buck to the hawkers, giving the market shopkeepers a clean chit.         
	We throw garbage into the vat. Its the hawkers who dont do so. We want the vat to have a gate, so that the hawkers cant throw their litter outside, said Sen.         
	Civicspeak: The vat generates about 5-6 tonnes of garbage daily and the litter starts piling up after we clean it early in the morning. But we cant bring carriers later in the day as the traffic police say it would add to the chaos. We have urged the hawkers and the market people to dump their litter in the vat, but most of them throw it on the road. It is a huge problem for commuters, said Arun Kumar Singh, the assistant director of solid waste management, Borough 1, CMC.         
	Councillorspeak: Namita Das, the CPM councillor of ward 3, echoed Singh. The vat does disrupt the traffic. The situation is worse on days when the CMC contractors dont turn up and the garbage piles up. But we report to the borough office then and they clean it up. The hawkers are also to blame as they dump the garbage on the road and not in the enclosed space. We are thinking of shifting the vat to some other place.         
	Policespeak: The vat is a serious traffic hindrance as the garbage spills on to the thoroughfare, narrowing the road space. It should immediately be removed, said a senior officer of Shyambazar Traffic Guard.                     JHINUK MAZUMDAR

          OUR BUREAU                               
	A fast track court in Kandi, Murshidabad, on Monday held five men guilty of kidnapping Jayanta Ghosh from his north Calcutta chamber and murdering him in a village in the district in March 2006.         
	Judge Amarnath Roy will pronounce punishment for Bablu Pal, Swapan Kahar, Raju Mishra, Jagannath Nashkar and Somnath Mistry, all aged between 24 and 30 years, on Wednesday.         
	According to lawyers, the five are likely to be awarded life imprisonment or death sentence.        
	Bablus elder sister Bidyapati and her husband Bikash, who were also accused in the case, were acquitted.        
	The 62-year-old doctor went missing from his chamber on Raja Manindra Road on March 6. Residents found Ghosh with his throat slit on a bridge in the Barwan police station area the next day. He died on the way to a health centre in the area.        
	Around 8.30am on March 7, Ghoshs wife Anima, a gynaecologist, received a ransom call of Rs 2 lakh.        
	The CID took up the investigation and arrested the accused on March 18, 2006.         
	The probe revealed that Bablu had sold off a plot in New Barrackpore, North 24-Parganas, for Rs 18,000 to fund the kidnap plan. He bought a pistol for Rs 2,600.         
	After the five failed to find a place to keep Ghosh confined on the night of March 6, they decided to kill him. Jagannath tried to shoot the doctor with Bablus pistol but it didnt fire. He then slit Ghoshs throat with a knife.        
	Anima said she was happy that her husbands murders would be punished. The progress of the investigation was satisfactory from the beginning, she added.

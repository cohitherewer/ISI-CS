The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bus wheels mow down two women
                                                                                                               Bus wheels mow down two women
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    Nargis Begum (top) and Chameli Ghosh                                  
	A young mother taking her son home and a retired BSNL employee returning from a gym were run over by speeding private buses moments after they got off their autorickshaws on Diamond Harbour Road on Friday morning.         
	The first mishap took place at the intersection of Ekbalpore Road and Diamond Harbour Road around 11am when one of two racing private buses plying on route 12/1 mowed down 36-year-old Nargis Begum.         
	She managed to push her six-year-old son Shakib away from the path of the bus before being crushed under its wheels.        
	The two were headed home to Ekbalpore Lane. The mishap occurred soon after they got off the autorickshaw they had taken from Hazra.        
	Shakib, who was taken to SSKM Hospital along with his mother, is in a state of shock, said Nargiss brother-in-law Mohammed Rafique. Her husband Mohammed Shamim works in a Fancy Market shop.        
	Minutes later, a private bus on route 21/1 hit 63-year-old Chameli Ghosh, who was returning from a gym to her Rai Bahadur Road home, near the No. 14 bus stand on Diamond Harbour Road, killing her instantly.         
	The driver fled, leaving behind the vehicle. Chamelis daughter Sanghamitra Das said her mother had joined a gym a couple of months back on the advice of a doctor.        
	My mother had fallen off rickshaws twice and injured her leg, so her doctor asked her to join a gym to improve her fitness. She left the gym near Simultala Bazar around 11am and took an autorickshaw. The mishap took place as soon as she disembarked, said Sanghamitra.        
	Chameli sustained fatal head injuries and died while being taken to Vidyasagar Hospital.        
	Residents blocked the Ekbalpore Road-Diamond Harbour Road crossing till 1.30pm, demanding facilities for pedestrians and action against rogue drivers.         
	The blockade was removed after senior police officers intervened. Officers of Behala Traffic Guard admitted that racing buses were a major problem on Diamond Harbour Road. Widening of the road had not helped since cars were being parked on both sides.        
	Pedestrians are forced to walk down the road because of encroachments on the pavements and buses dont comply with traffic rules, said an officer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Shout out loud to solve civic woes
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Shout out loud to solve civic woes
                                              
	The PUBLIC-GfK MODE survey in association with The Telegraph, published on November 8 in Metro, found the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC)  the biggest basic utility service provider to the residents of the city  to be among the worst performers in terms of human resources utilisation along with CESC and police.         
	Owning over Rs 32,000 crore-worth real estate in Calcutta, the CMC is the richest land-owner in the city. It has about Rs 1,800 crore from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in its kitty to revamp, in some cases, build, its drainage system. There are over 12,000 sweepers and zamadars on the civic pay roll. The total street network works out to approximately 1,500km; so for every 125 metres, there should be one sweeper. That should ensure a squeaky clean city.         
	CMC officials claim the city generates about 4,000 metric tonnes of garbage a day and 3,800 tonnes are removed.         
	Then why does the city look like it does? Why do citizens dont know, as found by the survey, that CMC is the cleaning agent?         
	The CMC lists its problems.         
	Trade unions and not civic authorities in reality allot work to a sweeper, says an official in the civic conservancy department.         
	It is a long-standing practice in the CMC that one mazdoor may have to sweep not more than 100 yards of one side of a road, says the official. The garbage will be collected later, only by another sweeper. And people from all strata, including highrises, keep throwing garbage outside, reminds Arun Sarkar, the chief engineer of conservancy. But the sweeper will not clean the street twice.         
	The system amounts to an estimated loss of one lakh work-hours every day  Rs 1 crore a day of taxpayers money.        
	Does this explain why 73 per cent of respondents in the survey said garbage was a problem?         
	Of all 600 respondents, 70 per cent said the same of water-logging and drainage and 50 per cent felt that water supply (see chart) was a problem.         
	Engineers in the water supply department admit that while low pressure, hard water and dearth of corporation-enlisted plumbers are the main complaints, only 20 per cent of complaints received by the department are resolved permanently or temporarily, while about 30 per cent of the problems cannot be resolved because of lack of infrastructure.         
	Many complaints remain unresolved or unattended because of political intervention. Sometimes residents of an area draw water by using pumps illegally, with the support of local political leaders, leaving little for the rightful owner of a supply line.         
	How do the citizens expect regular cleaning of surface drains when political leaders allow mushrooming of shanties covering surface drains? asks an engineer.        
	Then there is the CMC Act.         
	Bibhas Maity, the chief engineer (water supply) says that when a complainant is not the tax payer, it may be a problem. I know if each tenant of a particular house were provided with an individual ferrule the problem would be over. But under the CMC Act of 1980 a tax payer can get only one ferrule.         
	There is also a division of labour here. Only underground brick sewers come under the purview of drainage and sewerage department. The rest of the drainage networks are under the roads department.         
	The drainage department has drawn up schemes of over Rs 3,000 crore to revamp the citys drainage system with funds from the ADB and Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, the highest investment in the citys drainage service, says a drainage department official.        
	The CMC may yet have to be citizen-friendly, but at the same time it is a fact that civic administration has become more transparent. We have introduced e-centres, grievance cells, placed complaints and suggestion box and have been organising lok adalats, says mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.         
	Yet in the survey, among those who felt these to be among the top three problems, 17 per cent were not aware of the right agency to approach in case of garbage and 18 per cent were unaware of the agency in case of water-logging.         
	The CMC can be woken up. It is up to the citizens to din the message in.                     DEEPANKAR GANGULY

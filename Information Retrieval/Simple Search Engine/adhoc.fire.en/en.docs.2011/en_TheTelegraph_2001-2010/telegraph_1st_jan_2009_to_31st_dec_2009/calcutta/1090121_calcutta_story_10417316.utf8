           Spell check: The billboard riddled with mistakes near Raj Bhavan welcoming Maradona to the city. A Telegraph picture                             
	The West Bengal University of Technology has come out of its slumber and decided to cut seats in private engineering colleges that lack proper infrastructure before the next admission season (Seat slash cloud over tech colleges, December 13).           
	But there is a rider: the institutions will not face a seat slash if they set their houses in order before the next admission season.           
	So, there will be no punishment for past misdeeds, when these private institutions literally minted money at the cost of students education.           
	The criminal negligence of private engineering colleges and the university is shocking.           
	The proposed step by the university, one is tempted to believe, is more to help the promoters of these dubious colleges than the cause of technical education in the state.           
	With the pathetic quality of education at most private engineering colleges getting more and more media attention, coupled with the economic slowdown, the demand for even half-baked engineers is going down.           
	Seats of such colleges are thus remaining vacant anyway. So, a slash will not hurt the promoters of such colleges now.           
	One wonders that if they lack infrastructure, why were they given affiliation in the first place?           
	It is equally shocking to note that the university has no proper methodology of conducting inspections, and had to rely on the annual reports of colleges blindly.           
	Tapan Pal,
  Batanagar                       
	I disagree with psychologist Mohormala Chatterjee that the wrong spellings on the Maradona hoarding show how irresponsible and careless we are (picture captioned Hand of devil, December 4).             
	The errors reflect the socio-cultural profile of the organisers as well as the target audience of the show. The event was essentially a political exercise, aimed at regaining the lost ground of the ruling party in South 24-Parganas by showing an aged, overweight, rehab-returned, wife-deserter and promiscuous Maradona, who fits perfectly into the image the ruling party wants to sell to todays youth.           
	The growing number of legal foreign liquor off and on shops in Maheshtala in the Batanagar area is a glaring testimony to this.           
	Chameli Pal,
  Batanagar           
	Spelling mistakes in English are very common in West Bengal. This is the direct outcome of the CPMs myopic educational policies, under which English was not taught at the primary level for many years. With the reintroduction of English at the primary level, one expects such blatant spelling errors would not recur in future. Errors like Soccar on the billboard at Raj Bhavan were certainly Benglish since it is a phonetic translation of Benglish pronunciations like bhery good for very good.           
	A.S.Mehta, 
  New Alipore             
	At a time when the nation has yet to come to terms with the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, it is heartening to read about Captain Ryan Chakravorty, who was awarded the Alsoc Award at Xaviers 149, the reunion organised by the alumni association of the school. (Reunion, Ryan and rare resolve, December 13). Ryan was a team leader in the counter-hijack task force for the rescue mission in Mumbai. On the day he was felicitated, Ryan was doing his duty as part of the National Security Guard and so his father collected the award on his behalf.             
	The organisers also upheld the St Xaviers motto Nihil Ultra (Nothing Beyond) amid the celebrations.           
	Incidentally, Ryans father Shyamal Chakravorty is a retired officer of Calcutta police. His illustrious son set an exemplary precedent by carrying out his duty unnerved. A chip of the old block, indeed!           
	P.B. Saha, 
  Salt Lake             
	Apropos the report Telecom titans pass buck on SIM misuse, December 8, it is unfortunate that though terrorist activities have increased manifold throughout the world, many Calcutta shops are bypassing rules and handing over cellphone SIMs without proper verification. Such careless behaviour is risky for our country. Telecom operators also cant shrug off responsibility by blaming the retail outlets. They should conduct proper verification of the documents submitted by customers before activating the SIMs. Hopefully in future, everyone, from cellphone service providers to owners of mobile phone outlets, would be more vigilant.             
	Sourish Misra,
  Salt Lake             
	On the occasion of Vijay Diwas, celebrated to mark the victory in the 1971 war, the Indian Army organised various exciting displays at the Royal Calcutta Turf Club on December 12 and 15, 2008 (Open door for army drill, December 13). On both days, the events were followed by lowering of the Indian flag to the tune of the bugle. I was present on both days and noticed that while this was going on, most spectators were busy leaving. Would it have been a great inconvenience if they waited for 10 more minutes after a two-hour display?             
	Prantik Sanyal,
  S.P. Mukherjee Road             
	Apropos the report Pressure group of minority schools, December 12, it is encouraging to learn that minority groups have formed an organisation to fight the state governments policies that hinder the smooth functioning of their institutions. The ruling party is determined to rob these bodies of their autonomy to keep the education system in its grip. CPM cadres have also taken over a few schools and madarsas, holding party meetings and conducting political activities on their premises, which is shameful. School education minister Partha Dey should take immediate action on the charter of demands submitted by the group of minority schools and stop the illegal occupation of public spaces to preserve the sanctity of educational institutions.             
	Sukumar Ghosh, 
  Mukundapur             
	Apropos the report Cops leave door open for escape, December 9, such incidents are now common on court premises. They are hardly cases of dereliction of duty; they are, in fact, premeditated. Exemplary punishment should be given to the police personnel concerned in order to bring back the peoples faith in the law.             
	Govinda Bakshi,

	It is quite natural for the Centre to have second thoughts about upgrading Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) following the violence on campus and suspension of classes (Doubt over Besu upgrade, December 2). The atmosphere of learning on campus needs to be protected by students, teachers, institute staff as well as the authorities. Nowadays agitation in universities has become common. The Centre should impose a condition that an institute seeking upgrade should have a clean record of maintaining an educational atmosphere, without any disruption over at least the preceding five years. This would help to make everyone on campus cautious about their actions.             
	Dinabandhu Mukherjee,
  Behala             
	Apropos the report Parent protest over death December 3, it was shocking to read about the death of eight-year-old Iftesham Chowdhury after being hit by her yoga teacher. A teacher should be patient and dedicated.             
	Atif Ayaz,
  Serampore                   
	Apropos the report Panel for fatal accident charge, December 11, I fully support the state governments decision to book killer drivers under Section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), which is non-bailable, as rash driving is responsible for 95 per cent of all road accidents.             
	Prahlad Agarwala,
  Majdia, Nadia             
	Apropos your report A crack team to guide suburb makeover (December 10), the Batanagar industrial township did not become a ghost town because of the slump in the Bata factory. Rather, the slump happened because of militant trade unionism of the CPM. The Calcutta riverside township is rising over the skeleton of the Bata township.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bypoll bypassed in party zone
                                                                                                               Bypoll bypassed in party zone
          OUR BUREAU                                Madhyamgram: 84 per cent  Dum Dum: 74 per cent  Rajarhat-Gopalpur: 74 per cent  Mahestala: 73 per cent  Ward 63: 21.54 per cent     
	The citys swish set living in its food-and-fun streets all but bypassed Sundays by-election to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.        
	The turnout in the citys largest and most affluent ward was a meagre 21.54 per cent, reflecting what has always been a factor in civic elections in the area: voter indifference.        
	Even a cloud cover and droplets of monsoon rain could not lure the voter to the booth in the ward where election, what election? was the dominant strain, followed by a it wont make a difference to my life shrug.                
	Many residents of ward No. 63  stretching from Lindsay Street in the north till the Exide crossing on AJC Bose Road in the south, and from JL Nehru Road in the west to Park Street-Mullickbazar in the east  did not know that a municipal bypoll was being held in their area.        
	Some knew but didnt care. A few came to know about the poll only while enquiring why their locality was dry on a normal Sunday while the rest of the city wasnt.        
	Rajiv Agarwal, who lives in a highrise beside the Park Street post office, admitted that he wouldnt have known there was a poll had a Metro report (last Friday) with the words dry directive not caught his eye.        
	While attendance at the ward 63 booths struggled to cross the 4,000 mark, the combined footfall at popular mall and munch outlets on Camac Street and Park Street easily beat the ballot count.        
	It was like any given Sunday for us, crowded with families, said rivals McDonalds and KFC, while Pizza Hut and Pantaloons at 22 Camac Street were both bustling.        
	Residents said no party or candidate made an effort to woo the 21,000-strong electorate or raise any issue concerning the ward. Representatives of various parties claimed people staying in the highrises were generally indifferent to all elections. Residents of this ward do not depend on the municipal corporation for basic amenities. Hence the lack of initiative to select a ward councillor, said a veteran CPM leader.        
	Park Street resident Kanwaljit Singh said he did not know who the candidates were because nobody visited my residence with a voter slip.        
	For the record, the Trinamul Congress candidate is a former school principal, Sushmita Bhattacharya, while the CPM has fielded a former student leader, Mohammad Siraj, for the seat left vacant by the late Ajit Panja.        
	Tollywood film-maker Sudeshna Roy, a resident of Wood Street who was out location-hunting on Sunday, said: I didnt hear about any of my neighbours voting.

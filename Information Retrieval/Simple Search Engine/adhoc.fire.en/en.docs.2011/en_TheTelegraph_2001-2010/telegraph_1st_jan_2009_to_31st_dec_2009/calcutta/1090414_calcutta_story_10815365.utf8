                      Redefining Tagores philosophy                    Tagores poem Samanya Kshati is about a king who has to take the harsh decision of punishing his queen in order to uphold justice in his kingdom and to be true to his own conscience. It ends with the queen being asked to leave the palace. Based on this poem, Natyaloks maiden dramatic production begins where Tagores work ends. Through the language of folk and performing arts of Kerala, the play depicts the mental trauma of the common people upon hearing the kings verdict and what the queen does in the end. A contemporary drama, it presents an amazing amalgam of age-old traditions. Its design is composed of elements of Kathakali, Koodiyattam (the only living tradition of classical Sanskrit theatre), Kalarippiyat (the most ancient form of martial art in south-east Asia), Teyyam (a ritualistic art of Kerala) and Vellichapad. Through its action, the play evinces the philosophy that creation can come in the world only after destruction. Creative directors: Kalamandalam Piyal, Kalamandalam Goutam and Biswajit Das. Hosted by EZCC, Ministry of Culture, Government of India and Kala Bharati, Canada.                  Event: World premiere of drama Samanya Kshati, produced by Natyalok When: Today at 6 pm Where: Bharatiyam Cultural Multiplex, IB 201 Salt Lake

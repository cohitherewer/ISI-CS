The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Para clubs enter poll arena
                                                                                                               Para clubs enter poll arena

	Para or local clubs have appeared in a new avatar this poll season. They are not just organising community pujas and blood donation camps, but have also entered the political arena, becoming the latest propaganda machine for the CPM and the Trinamul Congress at different localities.         
	While Chhadmarupi Club at Sealdah is using its surplus Kali puja funds to put up hoardings for CPM candidate Mohammad Salim, 95 Pally Association at Jodhpur Park has taken upon itself to fund the billboard campaign for Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee.         
	But while Chhadmarupi has inscribed its name on the flexes and banners that it has put up in Sealdah, Park Circus and Tiljala, 95 Pally Association has decided to work behind the scenes and has confined its activities to its own para.         
	There are 100 members in our club and most of us are businessmen. We dont accept any grant or donation. We organise Kali puja and blood donation camps. We are utilising our surplus funds from Kali puja to highlight Mohammad Salim as the CPM candidate in the Lok Sabha election. Besides financing hoardings and banners, we are also distributing red caps and T-shirts with the party symbol printed on them, said Raja Roy of Chhadmarupi Club on APC Road.                  Members of New Abhijan Sangha have painted wall graffiti supporting Mamata Banerjee on Jodhpur Park houses       
	At Jodhpur Park, three clubs  95 Pally Association  93 Bloc Yubak Brinda and New Abhijan Sangha  are campaigning for Mamata Banerjee. Ours is a registered club set up in 1970. We are putting up festoons and banners in favour of Didi. But we are not putting the name of our club on them, said the assistant secretary of Yubak Brinda, Kajal Roy.        
	For New Abhijan Sangha, election is like a festival. If a wall graffiti needs to be painted, all our club members get together and we have a lot of fun doing the job, said Panchu Gopal Haldar, the president of the club. The club has done 10 flexes till now. We all want Mamatadi to win, he added.         
	Chief electoral officer Debasish Sen said: Distribution of T-shirts and vests bearing symbols or slogans of political parties among the electorate is banned.         
	According to him, a candidates upper limit on campaign expenditure is Rs 25 lakh. Even if clubs or NGOs spend from their own coffers in campaigning, the amount will be counted as campaign expenditure for the candidate. Hence, there is no scope for outsourcing, at least in the business of election campaigns.

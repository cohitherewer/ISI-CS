The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Travel guide for rally victims
                                                                                                               Travel guide for rally victims
  - City braces for traffic-choker commemoration of 1959 movement        A STAFF REPORTER                          Chalk a block: Biman Bose inspects the Sunday afternoon lull before Mondays logjam at the rally site. Picture by Amit Datta                                        
	On Monday afternoon, the Left Front will hold what it warns will be a massive rally to commemorate 50 years of its food movement.        
	The point of convergence will be the Esplanade corridor, popularly known as the Metro Channel, and the rally time is 1pm to 3pm, but police fear a logjam in the city centre from 11am to 5pm.        
	An officer of the traffic department said supporters would start arriving from 9am from all parts of the city. Traffic will be diverted as and when required, said the officer.        
	Metro compiles an advisory for victims of rally raj:        
	School children        
	Left Front chairman Biman Bose has said that children attending the morning session are unlikely to face much difficulty in reaching home, and has even requested rallyists not to obstruct afternoon students.        
	That, of course, is not going to happen. So, most schools have either decided to tell students to stay home if they fear disruption on the way back or to ring the final bell early so that students can beat the rally. A few have declared a holiday.        
	Office-goers        
	The police tip for those venturing into the heart of the city for work on Monday is simple: Take the Metro.        
	How Metro Railway, struggling with the confusion and the overcrowding of its longer run, will cope with the additional pressure of surface commuters diving underground remains to be seen. There is no plan yet to run extra trains on Monday as we are using the full capacity of rakes following the extension, said an official.        
	Flights and trains        
	The original advisory came from Biman Bose: I request those going to the airport or Howrah or Sealdah station on Monday to leave home with enough time to spare...        
	The national carrier and private airlines, too, have told passengers to leave home early. While they could keep their gates open longer than usual, there will be no change in the flight schedules. Just as there will be no change in the schedules at Sealdah, Howrah and Calcutta stations.        
	Plus, rallyists        
	Biman Bose has advised rallyists to follow designated routes, avoid Park Street, the AJC Bose Road flyover, Strand Road and Bidhan Sarani, park their vehicles properly, avoid cooking and lighting stoves on the Maidan, and, above all, not to enter into any clash with commuters.        
	How considerate of the captain of chaos!

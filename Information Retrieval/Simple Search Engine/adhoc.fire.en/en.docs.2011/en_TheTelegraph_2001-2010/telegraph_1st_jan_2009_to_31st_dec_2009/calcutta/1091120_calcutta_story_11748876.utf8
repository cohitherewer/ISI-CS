The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fund squeeze on flier safety
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Fund squeeze on flier safety

	Calcutta skies could remain less than safe for a while with a funds crunch prompting the authorities to defer the upgrade of the air traffic control (ATC) at the city airport.        
	The Rs 2,100-crore modernisation plan 15 per cent of the amount has been allotted for the upgrade of the ATC that now banks on dated equipment  had stated that work on all sectors would proceed simultaneously.        
	But P.K. Singhal, the regional executive director (east) of the Airports Authority of India, has clarified that work on the new ATC tower housing new-age equipment to ensure fliers safety might not start anytime soon.        
	Work on building the new tower is likely to be deferred because of a financial crunch. Once the building comes up, the new equipment will be installed, he said.        
	The three-year modernisation project took off in January and construction of the integrated terminal, underground car park and flyovers is on.        
	The delay in the ATC upgrade exposes the authorities flawed approach to airport modernisation. The most important aspect in aviation  passenger safety  is being ignored, said a pilot who did not want to be named.        
	Insiders point out that some of the key components that should have been replaced long ago but are still in operation include the radar, very high frequency omni range and flight data processing system.        
	Most of the crucial surveillance, communication and navigation gadgets at the Calcutta ATC are dated and frequently develop snags. The authorities are compromising on passenger safety by running the ATC with these equipment, said K.P. Mondal, the regional secretary (east) of the ATC Guild (India).        
	The guild has recently written to the AAI, demanding immediate replacement of the old gadgets.        
	The guilds letter states: No attention is paid to the design of the airspace and alignment of the air traffic service routes, which have a direct bearing on the safety of operations. Surveillance tools such as radar have a limited range and are prone to failures making things precarious at times. No standby radar facility is available in Calcutta....        
	ATC sources said Delhi and Mumbai airports had five radar each, three primary and two secondary.         
	Two of the primary radar are used to track flights within 60 nautical miles of the airports where the aircraft density is maximum, an official said. But Calcutta has only three radar, of which only one monitors aircraft within 60 nautical miles.        
	Singhal said three new radar  to be installed in Badu (North 24-Parganas), Katihar (Bihar) and Jharsuguda (Orissa)  will improve things.        
	ATC officials are also demanding dedicated air corridors for flight landing and take-off. Even smaller airports like the one in Ahmedabad has the facility, said an official.

                                                                                                               Air link to south cities
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Paramount Airways is planning to launch flights between Calcutta and Chennai in June. The service will later be extended to other south Indian cities.        
	This was announced by an official in the chief ministers secretariat on Wednesday. Paramount Airways managing director M. Thiagarajan met Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee during the day and informed him of his plans.        
	In response to the chief ministers plea to consider introducing services within the state, Thiagarajan showed interest in the Calcutta-Cooch Behar route, the official said.        
	The chief minister also suggested Bagdogra as another destination, the official added. Thiagarajan said Bhattacharjee had assured him of his governments support in starting the service.         
	Paramount will begin with two to three daily flights between Calcutta and Chennai. Later, the flights will be extended to Coimbatore, Madurai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi, Visakhapatnam and Tiruchirapalli.        
	Thiagarajan said Paramount was interested in West Bengal for many reasons. The airline is looking at expanding its operations to the north and the Northeast and Calcutta will play an important role as it is the gateway to the Northeast, he added.        
	Paramount is a business class airline which launched operations in Chennai in 2005 and soon spread its network across south India.         
	It later headed west to Ahmedabad, Goa and Pune.

                                                                                                               Bus crushes 60-year-old to death
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The spot where the mishap occurred. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                  
	A 60-year-old physically-disabled man was crushed under the wheels of a private bus while he was trying to cross a road in Narkeldanga on Monday afternoon.        
	The bus on route 44 was trying to speed away but bystanders intercepted it, caught hold of the driver and smashed the windscreen.        
	Residents squatted at the site of the mishap on Narkeldanga Main Road and prevented police from removing Mohammed Muktar Ahmeds body, throwing traffic out of gear.        
	Rapid Action Force personnel had to be called in as cops from the local police station were outnumbered by the protesters. The situation was finally brought under control around 6pm.        
	Tanna Singh, the bus driver, has been arrested and the case handed over to the fatal section of the traffic police. A case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder has been slapped on Singh, said an officer of the traffic department.        
	Witnesses said Mukhtar, a resident of Narkeldanga North Road, had waved at the bus to stop while trying to cross the road supporting himself on a walking stick.        
	The driver swerved right in an attempt to prevent another bus from overtaking him and knocked down the pedestrian. The walking stick was flung away and the front wheels smashed his hips, recalled Sunny Singh, a witness.        
	As news of the mishap spread, a 1,000-strong crowd gathered on the spot and chased the handful of cops who had turned up.        
	The protesters were lathicharged before the deputy commissioner of police (traffic), Dilip Banerjee, reached the spot with other officers.        
	In another mishap, an 18-year-old pedestrian, Mohammad Afroz, was crushed by a lorry in Kidderpore on Monday morning. Afroz was taken to SSKM Hospital where he died.        
	The lorry driver, assaulted by residents, was admitted to the same hospital with serious injuries in the head and legs. The vehicle has been seized.

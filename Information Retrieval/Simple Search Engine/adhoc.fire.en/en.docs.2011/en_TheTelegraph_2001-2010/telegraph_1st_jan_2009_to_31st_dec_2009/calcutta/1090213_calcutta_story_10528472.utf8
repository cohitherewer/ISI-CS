The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Second scan reveals marks 
                                                                                                               Second scan reveals marks 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The second post-mortem on GRP sub-inspector Arindam Mannas body revealed at least six injuries not noted in the first, sources in the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) said on Thursday.        
	Doctors who had specialised in forensics conducted the post-mortem on camera at the Medical College and Hospital morgue. They found injuries between Arindams neck and chest and in his legs that were not detected during the first post-mortem at Walsh Hospital in Serampore.        
	We havent got the report so we cant comment, said a senior CID officer.         
	The first post-mortem report had made it more or less clear that Arindam had committed suicide, said another officer. The discovery of more injuries may not change the conclusion but will throw up more details.        
	One of the doctors who carried out the second post-mortem said: There are at least eight ways a person can die after being hit by a train. We can even say whether a person jumped from the left of the train or the right and whether he was run over. We have taken everything into account, including the nature of the injuries we found on Thursday.        
	The doctors paid special attention to the injuries on Arindams left eye and his left hand, which was broken.        
	The team had verbally conveyed their findings to the investigators, said an insider. The report will be sent later.        
	A second post-mortem is invariably more exhaustive than the first since it is performed by experts, a senior CID officer said on Thursday night.        
	According to the cops, they would seek expert help to understand the possible reasons behind the fracture in Arindams left hand, the deep wound in his neck and the cuts on his eyes.        
	Very little food was found in Arindams stomach, suggesting that he didnt eat anything heavy before his death.        
	The investigators said they would speak to the GRP officers on Friday to find out where exactly Arindams body was lying beside the railway tracks and how.        
	They would also look for Arindams missing cellphone and SIM cards. His other cellphone was found near the tracks without the SIM card.        
	We took the measurements today but we will visit the spot once more tomorrow to cross-check the data and gather more information, said an investigating officer on Thursday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 42 pressure points choke city 
                                                                                                               42 pressure points choke city 
          OUR BUREAU                                      
	Mamata Banerjee is a writer, painter, singer  and an acupressure expert, with a twist.        
	If the traditional Chinese method describes how pressure applied at more than 660 points improves the flow of blood in the body, the Trinamul Congress leader demonstrated on Thursday how pressure applied at just 42 points can choke the flow of traffic in the city.        
	From 1pm to 2pm, Mamata Banerjee and her merry men (and women) targeted 42 crossroads in the city  each obstruction lasting for at least 15-20 minutes  to paralyse the city, and claimed they were actually doing it for the people.        
	The muscle flexing by the Mamata camp  clout on the streets of the city where no one really cares is still measured by the disruption index  left thousands of commuters stranded for anything between half an hour to an hour and a half, as the traffic system took a while to absorb the aftershocks.        
	Among the thousands held up in the horror hour was Sudakshina De, a young mother who left her Beleghata Main Road residence at 12.30pm to pick up her daughter from school in Esplanade when her taxi came to a halt at the Moulali crossing. My child will panic on not seeing me there when her school gets over, cried De, setting off on foot in desperation.        
	Indrani Sharmas plight was worse. She was taking her four-year-old son to hospital when the car was caught in the traffic snarl at Park Circus. My son is running high temperature and I have to reach the hospital as fast as possible, she pleaded with a constable, who just shrugged to show his helplessness.        
	Mamata, of course, spared a thought for Sudakshina, Indrani and all others who were caught in Thursdays logjam. We do not want to cause inconvenience to people by organising protests on roads. We are opposed to blockades and bandhs. But sometimes we have to resort to such practices to support a peoples cause, she announced after holding the city to ransom.        
	Mamatas men were more brazen. People were aware of the blockade. Moreover, we are doing all this for people, said Tapas Roy in Esplanade.        
	Thursdays peoples cause ranged from the cover-up of Arindam Mannas death and the demand of a CBI probe to the bail of CPM leaders in the Tapasi Malik case, from the terror tactics of the CPM cadres to the complete failure of the state machinery.        
	The police said the biggest roadblocks were at Moulali and the Park Circus seven-point crossing. Up north, Rajabazar, Beadon Street, Mahatma Gandhi Road, Nimtala Ghat Street and Maniktala were hard hit, while down south Diamond Harbour Road, Prince Anwar Shah Road, Gol Park, Hazra, Bhowanipore and Rashbehari Avenue bore the brunt. Traffic crawled in the central business district and came to a halt on Howrah bridge.        
	There was an attempt to block the chief ministers convoy near Chingrihata, where around 45 protesters were arrested. That apart, there were no arrests, said a senior officer of Calcutta police.        
	At the Moulali crossing protesters even deflated the tyres of vehicles that were trying to beat the blockade. I was waiting at the traffic signal when a few people carrying Trinamul flags came and deflated the front tyres, said taxi-driver Ramesh Sau.        
	Trinamul president Subrata Bakshi justified the partys protest programme even at the cost of the commuter. We admit that people were inconvenienced. But political parties can survive only if they organise road rallies in support of the people, said Bakshi.        
	The government played the matter-is-in-court card (see box). Standing counsel Subrata Mukhopadhyay said: Our government wants to give equal rights to common people and rallyists; we will inform our position to the court.        
	That is what the government has been promising to do since 2005.

	Calcutta University has refused to bow to student pressure and allow those with inadequate attendance to appear for undergraduate examinations.         
	Teachers, principals and officials of the university agreed on the stand after a series of meetings.        
	Agitation by students demanding permission to sit for examinations despite having low attendance is disturbing. The issue was discussed elaborately in the universitys undergraduate council meeting today. We will under no circumstance allow any student to appear for exams if he or she has less than 60 per cent attendance, said Dhrubojyoti Chattopadhyay, the pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs) of CU, on Wednesday.         
	The members of the council have appreciated the stance taken by the principals who have not succumbed to students pressure, he added.         
	The matter was also discussed in the teachers council meetings of various colleges and by the members of the All Bengal Principals Council.         
	The university on Wednesday decided to start a survey to assess if colleges were responsible in any way for students skipping classes.         
	Many youngsters think bunking classes is okay in college. This tendency is most pronounced among first-year students. The habit persists if restrictions are not imposed. We want to find out what the colleges have been doing to stop students from skipping classes, said a university official.        
	A scan of students attendance in colleges affiliated to the university revealed that less than 60 per cent students attend classes regularly in most. Many colleges award 10 to 15 per cent grace attendance to students so that they do not lose a year.        
	We want to stop this practice because this kind of leniency is encouraging the students with abnormally low attendance to demand permission to sit for exams, said the official.         
	Students of Heramba Chandra College, Jogamaya Devi College and Muralidhar College recently gheraoed principals for hours and organised hunger strikes, protesting the authorities decision to debar students who fell short on attendance from appearing for Part I.        
	At City College, 295 students were allowed to sit for Part I after they gheraoed the principal and teachers for over 24 hours from Saturday afternoon.        
	Principals of a number of colleges met on Wednesday to discuss what they can do if students pressure them for permission to sit for university examinations.        
	According to the university rules, each student must attend 75 per cent of the classes in a year to be eligible to sit for Part I, Part II and Part III. Those with attendance between 60 and 74 per cent are allowed to write the examinations after citing reasons for not attending classes and paying a fine.        
	We will have to offer quality education in college given the competition for jobs. We will be strict about not allowing students to sit for examinations if he or she does not attend class regularly, said Biplab Chakrabarti, the general secretary of the principals council.

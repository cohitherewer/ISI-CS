The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Student solidarity in mask movement 
                                                                                                               Student solidarity in mask movement 
                                        A student of Apeejay School on Friday		      So many people in this city are suffering from pollution-related lung cancer that it is scary. I also know of students who have developed breathing problems because of air pollution. The anti-pollution mask is not only for our protection but also a symbol of our protest (against official apathy).

	On Friday, Calcutta saw the birth of the child as activist as hundreds of students trooped into Apeejay School on Park Street wearing anti-pollution masks to protect themselves from pollution and send the message that they had taken their health into their own hands. The yellow anti-pollution mask introduced by the school will become a compulsory part of the uniform on Monday. Metro looks behind the mask to find out what prompted the students to take this radical step and how they intend taking the movement forward              
	Why wear masks to school?        
	So many people in this city are suffering from pollution-related lung cancer that it is scary. I also know of students who have developed breathing problems because of air pollution. The anti-pollution mask is not only for our protection but also a symbol of our protest (against official apathy), says Abhishek Mundhra, a student of Class X.         
	Spandan Chatterjee, another Class X student, nods his head in approval. I will carry the mask whenever I step out of home. If I am stuck in a traffic snarl, the mask will be my protection from noxious vehicle fumes. Classmate Nakshatra Pain hopes the sight of students wearing masks to school would finally make the authorities sit up and take notice.         
	Where does the campaign go from here?        
	Students of Apeejay School have decided to sponsor masks for underprivileged children who attend afternoon classes organised by them. Those who live in and around the slums of Mullick Bazaar are exposed to high levels of pollution. They need protection, too, says Nakshatra.        
	Apart from buying masks for the slum children, the students will make presentations to explain the effects of pollution on their health and what they should do about it.         
	The students have volunteered to buy around 65 masks for these children, says Janardhan Ghosh, the cultural co-ordinator of the school.        
	Apeejay School has also decided to organise an exhibition of different kinds of protective masks. We will hold the exhibition within a week and are looking forward to collaborating with other schools to raise awareness, says Ghosh.        
	According to Reeta Chatterjee, the principal and administrator of Apeejay School, mass participation is the key to the success of the initiative. We hope our initiative will motivate other schools to take the movement forward.        
	What readers think about Apeejays initiative        
	The decision by the Park Street and Salt Lake campuses of Apeejay School to make masks compulsory for students is without doubt a step in the right direction. Educational institutions need to play the lead role in raising environment awareness among children. I request other educational institutions to follow the example set by Apeejay.         
	 Prabhanshu Saha, Salt Lake              
	The mask movement is the most commendable one among the anti-pollution campaigns so far. This should hit where it hurts the most. The sight of children wearing masks in this heat is heart-wrenching enough to make indifferent officials squirm in their seats and take some measures to combat air pollution. Let our children do what the guardians of this city have failed to achieve.

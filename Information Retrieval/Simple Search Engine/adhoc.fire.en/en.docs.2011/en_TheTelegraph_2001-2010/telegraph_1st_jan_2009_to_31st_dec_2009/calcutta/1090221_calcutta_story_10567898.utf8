The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fear factor for films amp; food
                                                                                                               Fear factor for films amp; food
  - Plexes, restaurants feel the Feb blues        A STAFF REPORTER                                                  
	The fun has turned to fear in the film-and-food zones around town this February.        
	The four screens of the Cinemax-IMAX auditoriums at Mani Square flickered to life for two hours after two days before the lights went out once more.        
	People trickling in  no, it wasnt a flood even on a Friday and that is the crux of the mall-multiplex problem  to catch the big Bolly-Holly releases Delhi-6 and Valkyrie were told that the screenings were being suspended for technical reasons.        
	We recorded sizeable footfalls in the morning shows, but the AC plant developed a snag and the entire plex had to be shut down once again, said Cinemaxs operations head Debamita Nag Banerjee.        
	Late on Friday, the Cinemax-IMAX screens came alive again with the technical hitch being fixed.        
	The mall management attributed the stop-start-stop-start to technical issues but sources said the writing was on the mall wall.        
	This is the manifestation of a much bigger problem plaguing the EM Bypass mall where rentals have gone through the roof and the footfall through the floor, said a retailer in Mani Square.        
	Rent revision talks are on between the Mani Square management and some retailers reeling under the ripple effects of recession but the Cinemax-IMAX vs Mani Square matter had apparently come to a head over pending electricity, water and other maintenance charges.        
	All malls and multiplexes in town are feeling the blues with many plexes struggling to cough up the monthly rental, which ranges between Rs 35 to Rs 60 per square feet, depending on the potential of the property.        
	South Citys six-screen Fame multiplex and Big Cinemas housed in RDB Boulevard in Sector V have already approached their respective malls for a revision of the rent agreement.        
	While South City has lowered the rental rates for most of its vanilla stores (the smaller, non-anchor stores) by as much as 10-25 per cent for a four-month period, the rentals for the anchor stores  and that includes Fame Cinemas  has remained unchanged.        
	In these times of dwindling footfall, the anchors need to be given more cushion than the vanilla stores because our investment in the mall is greater, feels Fame.        
	If the big screen has lost its lure, the big bite has lost its teeth this year.        
	February has been one of the worst months in recent memory and business across the city has slumped by almost 25 per cent, said S.K. Khullar, the president of the Hotel amp; Restaurant Association of Eastern India, which has over 150 member hotels and restaurants in the city.        
	Leading restaurants that witnessed weekend queues till Puja and are now counting empty chairs blame it on the double whammy of downturn and duties.        
	Just when people are dining out less comes the added 20 per cent sales tax on liquor served at the table and a hike in staff dearness allowance, rued a restaurateur.        
	This has prompted some diners to down a peg or two at home or at a social club before heading for the restaurant. Wine sales have gone down substantially and so guests tend to order less starters as well, said a spokesperson for Mainland China.        
	With no respite in sight, film and food stops are resorting to survival tactics. Fame South City, for instance, has slashed its post-10pm show ticket prices to Rs 100 on a weeknight and Rs 120 on weekends.        
	If filmstops are tweaking ticket prices to woo viewers, foodstops are serving up buffet or combo meals to draw diners. Some have rolled back card rates, while others are throwing in a complimentary dessert or side dish.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Lost-and-found muddle of the marmoset man 
                                                                                                               Lost-and-found muddle of the marmoset man 
  - Sleuths piece together how handcuffed accused caught four cops napping and how he was traced          A STAFF REPORTER                           The recovered marmosets and (inset) Raj Saikia                                        
	Marmoset theft accused Raj Saikia could slip out of the Down Ahmedabad Express as all four of his minders  an inspector, a sub-inspector and two constables  were asleep in the air-conditioned comfort of the two-tier coach, the city police bosses have confirmed.        
	Raj, rearrested hours later by the same cop team in Chhattisgarhs Durg, was in cuffs  one end of which was locked to his berth chain  but he apparently had no problem slipping them off.        
	Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters), said there might be some problems with the handcuffs, that allowed Raj to make a monkey of his men. But then we use cuffs of the same make when accused are brought by train, he added.        
	Once out on Jharsuguda platform in Orissa, around 4.45am on Monday, he asked some people the way to the nearest motorable road and then headed for a barbers where he had a quick haircut, said a source privy to the reconstruction of events since Rajs disappearance.        
	Constable Shamsher Khan, who was sharing a berth with Raj, woke up while the train was still at Jharsuguda station and was shocked to see the handcuffs dangling from the berth chain. The cops  Khan, inspector Debashis Sarkar, sub-inspector Prasenjit Bhattacharya and constable D.G. Mahato  rushed out but the accused was nowhere to be seen.        
	Sleuths learnt that Raj had walked to the next railway station and hopped on to a truck on his way to Durg via Raipur. We had a hunch that Raj would return to his wife Rekha and two-and-a-half-month-old daughter in Durg. So our men got in touch with Rajs landlord in Durg, a Bengali youth, and he assured us of help, said an officer of the detective department. The Durg police, too, were alerted.        
	The four-member city police team left for Durg in a car and reached the town around 5pm. On the way the officers learnt from their Durg counterparts, who had tapped Rekhas cellphone, that Raj had called one of his friends and told him that he was in need of cash.        
	The landlord and his men as well as Durg police had fanned out in search of Raj. Our men, too, joined them. He was finally spotted entering an ATM and arrested, the officer said.         
	Raj was brought to Calcutta late on Tuesday, this time guarded by 11 men from the detective department.        
	Sujoy Das, also arrested for the marmoset theft, was on Monday grilled by a team from the Nandankan zoo in connection with the theft of a pair of macaws in July 2009.

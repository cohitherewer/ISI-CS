	Debomitra Chatterjee, 20, from the NGO Noble Mission at Mukundapur, off the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, is mentally challenged. But that didnt stop him from participating in Smayan, a fest for the differentlyabled.         
	It was organised by Sneh, the social service unit of Birla High School (Girls) on October 27 at Vidya Mandir auditorium. Dressed as half-Shiva and half-Parvati, Debomitra enacted a dialogue between the two gods of Hindu mythology.         
	Four deaf-and-mute boys from 11 to 18 years of age from the New Alipore NGO, Anubhav, presented a mime show urging the audience not to litter roads with garbage. Debomitra won the first prize in the fancy dress competition, while the boys bagged the first prize in the mime show.         
	In its fourth year, the fest included 250 children of the age group of six to 20 years, some mentally-challenged and others suffering from hearing impairment or autism, showcasing their talents in a variety of events. The participating schools and NGOs included Akshar, Anubhav, Noble Mission, Mentaid, Asha School, Manovikas Kendra, Oral School For Deaf and Dumb, Anjika and Alakendu Bodh Niketan.         
	The off-stage events, like basketball, throwball, sit-and-draw and creative art, took place on October 23 and 24, while the final day was reserved for events like the fancy dress contest, group dance and antakshari. A family of teddy bears made of clay, a hut made with matchsticks and a desert with clay camels were some of the items on display in the creative art section.         
	Youngsters dressed in costumes from Disneys Donald Duck, Goopy Gayen, Bagha Bayen to Bhooter Raja from the Satyajit Ray film, stole the show in the fancy dress competition.         
	The girls of Birla High couldnt stop talking about the participants.         
	Many of them are unable to hear or speak, but they communicate expertly in sign language. The students from Oral School for the Deaf and Dumb are so well-trained that they defeated us in a game of basketball, said Payal Kabra, a Class XII student and president of Sneh.         
	Our girls never sympathise with the challenged. They try to interact as equals, said Rajlakshmi Anand, the teacher-in-charge of Sneh. Sneh organises summer camps for underprivileged children as well as visits to old age homes and calamity-stricken areas.        
	The NGO Noble Mission was judged the winner.

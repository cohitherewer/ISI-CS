                                                                                                               Bank loot untraced
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The Baguiati branch of Indian Oversees Bank on Tuesday started an internal probe into Mondays Rs 25-lakh robbery, the police investigation into which has drawn a blank.        
	Around 1.30pm on Monday, six burglars knocked out the solitary guard of the branch, emptied the vault and packed the employees and customers into it before fleeing on motorcycles.        
	Mohammad Sharif Ali, the guard, had kept his rifle against the wall, away from his stool. He could not grab it before the robbers hit him on the head with a revolver butt.         
	R. Venkat Narayan, the senior manager of the branch, denied any security lapse on part of the bank.        
	A team of regional and zonal-level officials of the bank will try to find out how the robbery occurred and how it could have been prevented, he added.        
	Investigators said the branch did not have an automatic alarm system in the vault. An automatic alarm would have gone off when the robbers tried to enter the vault.        
	The bank held a meeting on Tuesday to discuss ways to tighten security. Senior officials and a security adviser from the banks regional headquarters in Esplanade inspected the branch, said Venkat Narayan.        
	Supratim Sarkar, the superintendent of North 24-Parganas police, said the investigators were exploring some leads. A preliminary probe pointed towards a gang from outside Baguiati, which was assisted by local criminals.        
	Only six of the branchs 16 employees turned up for work on Tuesday.

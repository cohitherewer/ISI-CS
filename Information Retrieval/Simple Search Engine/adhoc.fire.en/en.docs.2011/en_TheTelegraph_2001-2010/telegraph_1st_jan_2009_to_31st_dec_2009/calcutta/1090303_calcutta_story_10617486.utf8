	The innovative side of young minds was brought to the fore at the 34th Eastern India Science Fair for school students and the 8th Science and Engineering Fair for college students, hosted simultaneously by Birla Industrial and Technological Museum (BITM) in association with The Telegraph. The theme of the fair was, Science and Technology for Sustainable Development.         
	The event saw 206 school kids and 96 college students from Bengal, Bihar, Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh displaying their exhibits. The fair hones the practical skills of students and attracts them to core science, said Embadul Islam, the director of BITM.         
	The JC Bose Trophy for best individual exhibit went to Pranjal Das of Vivekananda Kendriya Vidyalaya of Arunachal Pradesh. He showed how electricity can be generated by making water from a reservoir flow through a tunnel to start the turbine. He won a scholarship of Rs 12,000 from the National Council of Science Museums (NCSM). I will use the money for my future studies, said the delighted Class VI student, aspiring to become a scientist.         
	The PC Roy Trophy for best team exhibit went to Class X students Anjali Gupta and Shradha Singhal of Palzor Namgyal Girls Senior Secondary School, Sikkim. They also won a scholarship of Rs 12,000 from NCSM. The girls presented a study on burnt plastic. We chose to treat plastic. Its poisonous gases were chemically treated in a chamber. The treated product has power conductivity and does not always hamper the growth of plants, said Shradha.        
	The best project crown went to a telephone-controlled device presented by Debapratim Sarkar, Saikat Das Adhikari and Sauparna Patra of Techno India College of Technology, Rajarhat. If we are away from home and have to switch on or off an electrical appliance, all we need to do is make a call to a cellphone and enter a code number. The phone is connected to the appliance and the minute it receives the code, the function is performed, said Debapratim. They also won a scholarship of Rs 12,000 each from NCSM.        
	There were five special prizes from The Telegraph of Rs 2,000 each. The winners included Meghnad Saha Institute of Technology for presenting a remote-controlled computer, RCC Institute of Ixnformation Technology for designing a unique face-recognition system, National Institute of Technology, Durgapur, for presenting a vein-detection system using infra-red rays, Future Institute of Engineering and Management for the robotic arm and Techno India for making a cellphone-controlled robot.                         Jaques Valade              
	France beckons        
	To facilitate greater exchange of students between India and France former French senator Jacques Valades visited Calcutta on a two-day trip on February 18 and 19.         
	We have a sizeable student exchange between the two countries and we hope to have more in the coming years, said Valade, the ambassador in charge of decentralised cooperation in Asia.         
	From 650 Indian students in France in 2005, the number rose to 1,700 in 2008. Valades mission was to explore possible areas of cooperation between France and Asian countries. Campus France, based in Alliance Francaise du Bengale, has several activities to aid this collaboration.         
	Campus France was started in 2006 in Calcutta under the ministries of foreign affairs and national education to promote French education among Indian students. We conduct presentations in colleges and schools on applying for higher education in France, including ways of availing scholarships, said Nusrat Hossain, education advisor of Campus France.         
	During his trip, the ambassador made a visit to Heritage Institute of Technology, where he interacted with faculty members. It was a privilege for us to host the French delegation, as we want to initiate exchange programmes for our students, said Probir Roy, the executive director of the Heritage Group.

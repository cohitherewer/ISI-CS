                      Untold tales of life                    Romanticism is a common trait of the art and poetry of any era. Such works may celebrate nature, sing praises of the miracle of life, or simply convey the artists or poets feelings of love for his beloved. The works of Subrata Acharya, however, seem to deliberately avoid being placed in this category. Innocent and childlike though they may appear at first glance, they are clearly shorn of any influence from or resemblance to fantasy and myth. His canvases speak of wisdom and insight that have certainly been born of personal experience. Memory attached.., the ongoing show of his paintings, features works that are deceptively simple in form and design but carry a depth of meaning and significance. Some of them are silent, eerie and haunting, while others shock the viewer into realisation. Similar to a childs irrational sketches, Acharyas paintings are astonishingly bold and stark in terms of presentation, yet touched with a realism that is far removed from being a vapid imitation of life. In fact, they articulate certain obvious, timeless truths of life that are often forgotten in the midst of its uncertainties. They narrate the mundane, little details of life that are important enough to hold in themselves the crux of our existence.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Waugh way for teen talent
                                                                                                               Waugh way for teen talent
          RITH BASU                          Steve Waugh with three of the youngsters he chose from Udayan at the cricket clinic on Friday. (Aranya Sen)                                  
	Surendra Mandi could not stop grinning on Friday afternoon. The most capped Test player and arguably the most astute cricket brain in recent times, Stephen Rodger Waugh had predicted that a season or two of coaching would guarantee the 16-year-old a place in the Kolkata Knight Riders.        
	The Class VIII student was one of the four from Udayan, a rehabilitation home supported by Waugh, who received tips from the cricket great at Subhash Sarobar on Friday.        
	Its so exciting to watch the IPL on TV. We dont miss a single match at Udayan. It would be great if I could be a part of it one day, said a timid Surendra, whose deliveries, however, had the batsmen hopping at Fridays session.        
	Steve corrected the position of my front arm at the delivery stride and I was able to bowl faster and with more control, said the teenager.        
	A day after the World Cup-winning former Australian skipper waded into a Thakurpukur canal to clear the muck, he got down on his knees to help Surendra and his friends from Udayan  Ramesh Gope, Bimal Karmakar, Bapi Lohar  put on batting pads and other cricket gear for the first time in their lives.                       
	They have played with tennis ball all their lives. They took a bit of time to adjust to the equipment and the lower bounce of the cricket ball. But after a while all four boys came into their own and did very well, Waugh told Metro.        
	He had handpicked the boys after a game of tennis- ball cricket at Udayan on Wednesday. It was a great experience playing with the kids. Some of them were pretty smart my stumps were knocked out a couple of times their enthusiasm was amazing, they were charging in... More than their cricket, they impressed me with their athleticism. I was very impressed by the way they moved and their keenness to play.        
	The session was organised by Standard Chartered Bank for children of some of their clients and the four teenagers from Udayan. Waugh distributed cricket kits to the participants. Later, trainees at the Arun Lal Cricket Academy, Beleghata, the venue, also joined in.        
	Now that we have four sets of cricket equipment, all of us at Udayan will play with cricket balls, said Ramesh, who was amazed at the power he could generate after a slight adjustment to his batting stance on Waughs advice.

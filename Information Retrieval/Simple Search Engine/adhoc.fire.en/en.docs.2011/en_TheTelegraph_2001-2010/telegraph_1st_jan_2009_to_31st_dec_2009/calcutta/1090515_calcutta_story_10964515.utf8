					      Todays question: Should the college authorities go soft on ragging? More responses will be published next week                              
	SHREYA MITRA, 
  Rajpur									      
	I am a Class X student. I had planned to study software engineering outside West Bengal. But after seeing the fate of ragging victims, I have changed my decision. Seniors should welcome juniors and help them adjust to the new environment. College authorities should punish such seniors in a way that nobody dares to rag again.               
	

TANUSREE RAY, 
  Address not mentioned									      
	Ragging shatters the ambition of freshers. College authorities should suspend students guilty of ragging without waiting for a probe.      
	CHIRAG MANDAL,     Belur          
	Ragging crosses the limits of tolerance on most occasions. It affects students psychologically, especially the introvert ones. So college authorities should never go soft on ragging. An independent body should be formed, free from political influence, to inspect whether anti-ragging laws are implemented properly by the college authorities. The punishment meted out to students involved in ragging should be exemplary, so that others do not dare to emulate them.               
	

DAULAT RAM AGARWAL, 
  Bangur									      
	The college management cant afford to keep mum on such a serious issue. Ragging should be constructive in nature, not destructive. Playing with students emotions is not acceptable.               
	

SAMIR CASSIM ARIFF, 
  Amartalla Lane									      
	Ragging is a crime and many innocent lives are lost because of it. The Supreme Court has issued directives to prevent such incidents. The college authorities should take stern action against students involved in ragging.               
	

KSHAMA AGARWAL, 
  MG Road									      
	The intention and motive behind ragging has changed drastically over the years. Ragging was meant to be an enjoyable session with seniors and a sort of introductory chapter to college life. But it has become ghastly now. The psychological impact of ragging is often very bad. College authorities need to interfere to stop this evil.               
	

SRIKALA NAIR, 
  Bhowanipore									      
	Ragging, friendly or violent, cannot be justified in any way. It should be completely uprooted from our educational institutions. I cant believe that a concept that had begun for building rapport among the students can go to the extent of taking lives. Strict punishment for the culprits is the only way to prevent it.               
	

KAUSHIK DAS
  Address not mentioned									      
	As a faculty of a college, I feel that ragging should be controlled by the teachers and the authorities of each college. All faculty members should be cautious at the time of admission. There should be anti-ragging posters in all colleges, which I have not seen in most of the colleges. There should be interactive sessions and seminars against ragging. The authority should also take strict measures against the students involved in ragging. They should not hide the fault of the students.              
	

TUHIN PURKAYASTHA 
  Parnashree Palli									      
	I think ragging is a crime. College authorities should take proper action against raggers. Mostly weak students and girls face this problem.               
	

M.K. Kuri 
  Garia									      
	Ragging should be banned from all educational institutions. The idea that seniors and juniors should get acquainted through fun-filled activities has no meaning today. Authorities should save the lives of innocent students.       Send your views to

                      Plays with a purpose        Perhaps one of the biggest events on the Indian theatre calendar, Nandikar rsquo;s National Theatre Festival is an annual affair much anticipated by theatre-lovers in this part of the country. Initiated in 1984 to commemorate Nandikar rsquo;s silver jubilee, the festival has not looked back since. The ongoing 26th edition of the festival began on a sober, serious note, reminding one of the need for universal peace and brotherhood in these troubled times. In its attempts to promote understanding and amity at the grassroots level, Nandikar has welcomed participation by theatre groups from politically disturbed regions like Bangladesh and Pakistan, besides troubled Indian states like Assam and Manipur. It concludes today with day-long performances of a number of thought-provoking, socially-relevant plays by the festival host. To be staged are: Jaai Ekti Baar; a collage of Tagore rsquo;s poetry (dir: Jhulan Mukherjee) and Hariye Jete Nei Mana (dir: Rimi Majumdar) both presented by Nandikar rsquo;s Children rsquo;s Ensemble,10 am; Dulia (dir: Swatilekha Sengupta) and Indian Idol (by Nandikar rsquo;s Children rsquo;s Ensemble; dir: Debshankar Haldar) at 3 pm and Ajnatobass (dir: Sumanta Gangopadhyay) at 6.30 pm.

                      Grounded in reality                    Though very different in their vision and technique, what unites artists Avijit Mukherjee, Atish Mukherjee and Viraag Desai is their quest for original expression. In Fantastic Visions, the ongoing group show of their works, they break away from safe and familiar territory, reflecting thoughts and ideas that have topical relevance, but shaded with a dash of humour. The metaphorical works of Avijit Mukherjee comment on globalisation, environmental degradation, political chaos and changing social mores. Atish Mukherjee depicts human feelings, instincts, emotions and relationships in a style that conveys his closeness to nature. Using motifs ranging from classical Christian imagery to Indian mythological figures, the canvases of Viraag Desai illustrate diverse social behaviours, including struggle and domination, as well as mans age-old desire to hold on to a system of beliefs.

  - Cancer patient goes from hospital bed to poll booth with oxygen support          SANJAY MANDAL                          for that little blue mark: Dilip Kumar Chakraborty, a 68-year-old patient of lung cancer, insisted that he be taken in an ambulance to cast his vote on Wednesday. I dont know whether I will live to vote again.... My vote is precious, he said. Picture by Amit Datta                                        
	A lung cancer patient who was coughing blood on Tuesday went to vote with oxygen support on Wednesday, showing the 28 per cent who didnt enter a booth just what it takes to make every vote count.        
	I dont know whether I will live to vote again because my health has been deteriorating every day. But more than anything else, I think my vote is precious and I wouldnt waste it for anything, said Dilip Kumar Chakraborty, a retired state government employee.        
	Chakraborty, 68, was wheeled out of the Park Street hospital where he is undergoing treatment around 11am and put in an ambulance that took him to the booth at Dharmadas Trust Model School, on Nepal Bhattacharjee Street in south Calcutta.        
	As the frail Kalighat resident was stretchered into the polling booth with a nasal pipe breathing oxygen from a cylinder to his cancer-ravaged lungs, he became one of the heroic faces of polling day along with Sheikh Jamshed, a 60-year-old stomach cancer patient who voted in north Calcutta.        
	Chakrabortys doctors were unsure till around 10am on Wednesday whether they should be taking the risk of allowing him to go to a booth and cast his vote.        
	He was coughing blood and required a blood transfusion on Tuesday. He is unable to eat anything, but his condition improved slightly on Wednesday morning. We arranged for him to go in an ambulance with oxygen support and trained attendants because his right to vote seemed to matter to him as much as his life, said Ashish Mukherjee, the director of the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Cancer Research Institute.        
	Jamshed, a printing press owner, displayed the same zeal to vote against all odds. Like Chakraborty, he was taken from the cancer hospital to his booth in an ambulance, though he did not require oxygen support.        
	I have been bedridden, either at home or in hospital, for the past few months. But that does not mean I have to give up my vote, Jamshed said. I am not sure I will be able to vote again but I did it on Wednesday and am proud of it.        
	Jamshed has a word of advice for each registered voter who did not turn up at a booth. One vote can be the difference between winning and losing for a candidate, and every vote polled is vital to the future of this country, said Jamshed, of Calcutta North.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Govt sits on school plea for recognition
                                                                                                               Govt sits on school plea for recognition

	The future of more than 700 Urdu-speaking children from economically backward families in Belgachia hangs in balance as the state government is allegedly dragging its feet in granting recognition to a Urdu-medium school.        
	The members of Belgachia Education Trust, an NGO that had set up Belgachia Muslim High School in 2000 to promote education among Urdu-speaking children from local slums, said the government had been sitting on its plea for recognition over the past two years.        
	We had submitted our proposal to government seeking recognition for our school in 2006. The government is yet to respond, said Mosharaf Hussain, the secretary of the trust.        
	Hussain claimed the trust had completed all formalities while applying for recognition. The school education department is neither rejecting our proposal nor pointing out our lapses so we could do the needful. We are not being able to do anything because of this inaction, said Hussain.        
	The inaction has prompted the trust to write to the government seeking information about the status of its application under the Right to Information Act.        
	There should not be any delay if the school fulfils all requirements. We have to examine on what grounds the recognition has been kept on hold, said Sukumar Mahapatra, the joint secretary of the school education department.        
	An official in the school education department, who did not want to be named, said: The proposal has been sent to the district inspector schools. The official will inspect the school and verify whether it fulfils all criteria for recognition.         
	The school, with 700 students on its rolls, follows the Madhyamik curriculum and runs classes from Lower Nursery to Class X.        
	In the absence of recognition and affiliation of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education, the students are required to appear in Madhyamik as external candidates.        
	The school can seek affiliation from the secondary education board only after the government grants recognition.        
	In the light of the Sachar Committee report which had highlighted the poor state of Muslims in Bengal in 2007, the CPM had announced a time-bound action plan on education, grant of scholarship, self-employment and madarsa education. We are shocked to see the government has not even bothered to respond to our proposal for so long, said a member of the trust.        
	The school now depends on donation and honorary service by teachers and is run from a makeshift shed on an eight-cottah plot owned by the trust.         
	Since the government has not recognised the school, we are not getting funds from private agencies for constructing a permanent structure, a trust member said. The Maulana Azad Foundation has agreed to sponsor funds for setting up the building. But the money will come only after we get the recognition.        
	Hussain said there was a great demand for a Urdu-medium high school in Belgachia. There is now only one school for the 50,000-odd Urdu-speaking people living in the slums of Belgachia.

  - Aila toll on streetlights          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                          A lamp post felled by Aila near Science City on Tuesday. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha                                        
	Not one uprooted lamp post has been replaced even two weeks after Cyclone Aila brushed past the city. Result: darkness on streets after sundown in pockets across the city.        
	Of the 1.26 lakh lamp posts on 1,700-odd streets in the city, 780 were uprooted during the May 25 storm.        
	We hope to replace all the felled posts by the last week of this month. Its taking time because we have to procure new lamp posts after floating a tender, said Pradip Jyoti Biswas, the director-general (lighting) in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.        
	Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said the civic body had sought the help of two supply agencies in the city  CESC and the state power utility  to restore electricity in the storm-affected pockets at the earliest. Around Rs 2 crore has been sanctioned for the purpose.        
	The streets in Khanaberia (Dhapa), parts of Chowbhaga and Panchannagram (east Calcutta) plunge into darkness after sundown. Patches of darkness also descend on Northern Avenue, some roads in South Sinthee and Paikpara, Southern Avenue, Belvedere Road, Alipore Road, Diamond Harbour Road, James Long Sarani and a few thoroughfares in Behala.        
	In Behala and some other areas we have made a temporary arrangement by installing searchlights, said Biswas.        
	Officials in the accounts department said Aila had left the civic body poorer by around Rs 5 crore. Almost half the loss has been borne by the lighting department.        
	Removal of uprooted trees had cost Rs 6 lakh, the amount mostly spent on hiring labourers and buying implements to cut the trees.        
	A civil engineering department official said around 5km of roadside railings have been destroyed in the storm and would have to be replaced.                                      
	The city has 1.26 lakh lamp posts with 2.32 lakh lamps glowing on them across over 1,700 streets in Calcutta and 95 per cent of them are maintained by the city civic authorities which has a lighting department with an employees strength of 125.              
	Altogether 780 lamp posts, he said, along with fittings have been uprooted by the Aila in money terms the loss has been to the tune of over Rs 2.25 crore.

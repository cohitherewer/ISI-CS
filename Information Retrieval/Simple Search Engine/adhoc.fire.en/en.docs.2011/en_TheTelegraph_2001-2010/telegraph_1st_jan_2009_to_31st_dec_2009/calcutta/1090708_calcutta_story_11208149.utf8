The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Girl snubs abusive father
                                                                                                               Girl snubs abusive father
  - Nine-year-old hopes HC will overrule custody ruling           OUR BUREAU                                    
	A nine-year-old girl scarred by domestic violence has refused to stay with her father despite a court ruling that she would be better off with him than her mother.         
	Arundhati (name changed), a Class V student, was shattered when her father, a senior executive with a power company, was awarded custody on the ground that he was financially capable of taking care of her while his estranged wife was not.         
	Mother Nilima recently moved Calcutta High Court challenging the legality of the Alipore district courts ruling. I cant let her (Arundhati) go. She is all I have, and there is no guarantee that she will be safe in my former husbands custody, the 29-year-old told Metro on Tuesday.         
	Arundhati, mature beyond her years, said she was sure that her father did not care much for her. He had once snatched me from my mother and put me in a hostel. He did not visit me even once, not even when I took ill. I will not go with him, she said, seated next to her mother in their Baghajatin home.         
	The girls parents married in 1997 and she was born two years later. Arundhatis father and his parents next wanted a boy. Nilima was subjected to physical and mental torture because she could not give them what they wanted, Nilimas lawyer, Subrata Mukhopadhyay, said.         
	The district judge had first ruled in favour of Arundhatis mother. Her father immediately appealed against the order in the high court, based on which Justice Tapan Dutta issued a directive asking the district judge to revisit the case.         
	This time the Alipore court awarded custody of Arundhati to her father, saying that she would get better schooling and all other material requirements if she stayed with him.         
	We have since obtained an interim stay (from the high court) on that order, Mukhopadhyay said.         
	Arundhatis greatest fear is being abducted again by her father.         
	He comes to my school to fight with my mother and take me away. I have asked him not to come to school or to our house. My friends often ask me why he treats me like this, the nine-year-old said.         
	For Nilima, the mounting legal expenses are as much a worry as the prospect of her daughter being taken away from her. I am not sure I can continue fighting my former husband because he keeps filing one case after another. He has the money to keep dragging me to court but I dont.        
	Nilimas husband deserted her in 2006 and filed for divorce. The divorce case is still pending.         
	According to Nilimas family members, Arundhati often talks about being witness to the alleged torture her mother faced when her parents lived in the same house.         
	Even if the court asks me to go (to her father) I wont I will cling tightly to my mother so that he cant take me away, she said.         
	Mukhopadhyay hoped the high courts judgment would be based on what the traumatised girl wanted.

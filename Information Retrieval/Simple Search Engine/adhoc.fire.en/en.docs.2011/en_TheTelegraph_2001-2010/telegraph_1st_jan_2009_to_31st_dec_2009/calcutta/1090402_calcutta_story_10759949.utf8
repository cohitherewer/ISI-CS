The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Womans body found
                                                                                                               Womans body found
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The partially decomposed body of a woman in her mid-30s was found outside the front door of a house in a narrow lane in Taltala on Wednesday morning.        
	The woman was wearing sindoor and was clad in her innerwear. The back of her skull was smashed. It seems she was killed at least three days ago. She was possibly hit with a blunt weapon, said city detective chief Jawed Shamim.        
	Investigators said the post-mortem didnt indicate sexual assault.        
	Residents said they spotted the body lying in Kumaden Bagan Lane around 6.10am and immediately informed Taltala police station.        
	Since the lane is too narrow for a car to enter, the police suspect that at least a couple of persons dumped the body outside the house.        
	The woman wasnt identified till late on Wednesday.

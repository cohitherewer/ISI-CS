	The body of a 70-year-old deaf and mute man was found in his flat in Belgachhia on Sunday morning, with neighbours and a relative blaming the death on torture and malnutrition.        
	Gadadhar Ghoshs sister and neighbours said he was regularly tortured by elder brother Prasad, with whom he had been sharing the flat for the past 40 years, and domestic help Monika Ghosh.        
	Monika lives in the same apartment with her daughter. The maid and Prasad were brought to Tallah police station for questioning but were not detained or arrested.        
	Gadadhar had written to me saying he was not being given enough food. He also said my elder brother and Monika forced him to do household chores and even assaulted him, said Gadadhars elder sister Jolly Das.        
	Prasad, however, said his brother had been suffering from TB and died of a massive cardiac arrest around 8am on Sunday. I took the best possible care of him, said Prasad, a retired employee of Calcutta Port Trust.        
	The police sent the body to RG Kar hospital for post-mortem It seems the man was undernourished. We have started a probe following a complaint by his sister, said an officer of Tallah police station.        
	Neighbours said they sensed something amiss when they found out that Prasad was being secretive about his brothers death.         
	I came to know about the elderly mans death from a resident of the estate whom Prasadbabu had called, asking whether there was any doctor around who would issue a death certificate. I sensed foul play and informed the police, said Arun Mukherjee, a neighbour.        
	Some neighbours said Gadadhar had also written to them describing how he was being tortured and made to starve.

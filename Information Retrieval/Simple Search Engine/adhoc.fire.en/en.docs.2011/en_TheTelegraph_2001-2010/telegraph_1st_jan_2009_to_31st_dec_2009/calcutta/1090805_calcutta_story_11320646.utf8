The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Copy slur on Tolly film
                                                                                                               Copy slur on Tolly film
          OUR BUREAU                              Legal tangle: Stills from Namastey London and (above) Poran Jai Joliya Re				                                 
	Mumbai-based filmmaker Vipul Shah moved the high court on Tuesday, accusing Bengali film Poran Jai Joliya Re, produced by Shree Venkatesh Films, of being a frame-by-frame copy of his 2007 release Namastey London, starring Akshay Kumar and Katrina Kaif.         
	Tollywood insiders said this was the first instance of a Bollywood filmmaker taking a Tollywood producer to court for plagiarism.         
	Stating before Justice Nadira Patheriya that Shree Venkatesh Films didnt have the copyrights of Namastey London, Shah sought a court order to stop the screening of the Bengali film. Poran Jai... released on July 24 in 115 theatres across the state. The Bengali films director, Ravi Kinnagi, and scriptwriter Sahana Dutta have been made respondents in the case.        
	Justice Patheriya admitted the plea under the Copyright Act and fixed the matter for hearing on Wednesday. The court asked Shree Venkatesh Films to submit an account of its earnings from Tuesdays ticket sales.         
	We are looking for some relief, lets see how the case progresses. I am in Mumbai and my lawyer is handling the case in Calcutta. If needed, I will fly down to Calcutta, Shah, the owner of Blockbuster Movies, told Metro.         
	Starring Dev and Subhashree, Poran Jai... is the story of an NRI girl who comes to India on her fathers request and gets engaged to a village boy. She then asks the boy to go abroad with her and experience her lifestyle.         
	The matter is sub judice and so we will not comment on it, said Soumya Roychowdhury, the advocate for Shree Venkatesh Films.        
	Tollywood is standing by the makers of Poran Jai.... Vipul filing a case against Venkatesh only proves that Bengali cinema is being recognised nationally. And what does he mean by plagiarism? Also, how can he claim to stop screening in 115 halls? Its not feasible, said Arijit Dutta of Priya Cinemas.

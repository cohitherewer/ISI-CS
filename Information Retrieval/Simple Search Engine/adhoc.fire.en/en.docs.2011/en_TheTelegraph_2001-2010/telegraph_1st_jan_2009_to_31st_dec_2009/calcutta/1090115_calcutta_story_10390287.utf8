                                                                                                               From horror home to parents arms
  - Boys shifted to NGO shelter, govt orders probe          OUR BUREAU                           Inmates at the Jatiya Jaradhi Samsad home in Baruipur on Wednesday. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                                        
	A 15-year-old mentally and physically challenged boy who went missing from his Kankinara home in 2007 and landed in the Baruipur shelter where another teen inmate died of malnutrition on Sunday, was reunited with his parents on Wednesday.         
	Ranadeb Halders vision has been partially impaired since he was admitted to the home and he, too, is suffering from acute malnutrition.        
	He, along with three other inmates of Jatiya Jorodhi Samsad, were shifted to a child care centre in Park Circus on Wednesday for treatment. A doctor there said the children were also suffering from skin diseases having lived in unhygienic conditions.        
	We saw our son in a television news report on the poor condition of the Baruipur home on Tuesday night.. We rushed to Baruipur police station in the morning and told the officers about our son. They took us to the home where our child was with the other boys. As soon as we called him by his name, he responded, said Ranadebs mother Khelarani.        
	She and her husband Ranajit, an electrician, had lodged a police complaint, launched an extensive search and even announced a reward to trace their youngest after he went missing from their drawing room in August 2007. According to the register of the home, Ranadeb was found by GRP personnel near Barasat railway station. He was sent to the shelter because he could not tell his address.        
	The 26 inmates of Samsad other than the four have been shifted to an adjacent home, run by an NGO called Offer, said state social welfare minister Biswanath Chowdhury.        
	The government has ordered a probe into the functioning of the Samsad, which used to receive Rs 750 per month for each inmate, under the Juvenile Justice Act. The state government has given Rs 1,76,000 to the home over the past three years. The Centre hasnt provided funds yet. We have to find out how the money was spent, said Sujan Chakraborty, the MP from the Jadavpur constituency, which includes Baruipur.        
	The state has 24 homes like Samsad, where over 1,300 children live. Six of the homes are run by NGOs with assistance from the government. There are constraints but there is no denying that there were lapses on the governments part in monitoring the home. The supervision procedure must be restructured and strengthened. If we had acted on time, an untimely death could have been averted, added Chakraborty.        
	A nine-member committee, led by local panchayat member Sahidul Islam, was formed on Wednesday to run the home.

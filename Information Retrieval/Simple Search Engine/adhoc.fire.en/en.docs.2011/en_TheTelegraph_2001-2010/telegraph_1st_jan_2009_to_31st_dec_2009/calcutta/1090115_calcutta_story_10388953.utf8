                      Vibrant tableaux of unsung tragic heroes                    City art lovers are currently being treated to a sumptuous fare by Calcutta Painters group as it hosts a solo exhibition of paintings by distinguished artist Rabin Mondal after a gap of four years. The exhibition has works that mark every stage of development in this almost-self-taught octogenarian painters remarkable artistic journey from 1956 till 2009. The current show displays more than 40 drawings and paintings that spans his oeuvre; covering oils, acrylics, pen and ink and watercolours, and is an impressive revival of the old spirit. Mondals works are mainly figurative. He paints in bold strokes and creates tableaux, whose themes are universal. The profiles of his figures stare out of the canvas  strange and pensive, yet strong and defiant, not defeated but surviving by sheer force of the spirit. The artist mostly uses dense pigments in blacks and reds, with occasional moss green and turquoise colours seeping through. His contemporary paintings have a primitive feel and communicate with the viewer at a very primal level. His teeming milieu features tales of tragic heroes in everyday life.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Permit scam under scanner
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Permit scam under scanner
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Police on Monday started a probe into reports of transport permits being issued on the basis of fake challans. Transport minister Ranjit Kundu requested the detective department to probe the matter after a computer in his department detected two challans with the same serial number, which appeared to be issued by the Reserve Bank of India.         
	The minister has also initiated a departmental inquiry into the matter.         
	We cannot say exactly how many permits were issued on the basis of fake challans or for how long this has been going on. We are also yet to assess the extent of loss in revenue, said Kundu.        
	A transport department officials said after the fake challans came to light, senior officials contacted the RBI and submitted preliminary reports with the apex bank.         
	The official blamed touts for the scam. They are responsible for the corruption in each step of seeking a permit, he claimed.        
	Transport department sources admitted that a large number of commercial vehicles had been operating with fake permits in and around the city for years. Autos are the worst offenders in this regard, with at least 30,000 illegal three-wheelers plying in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area (CMA) till July 31, 2009.        
	Officials put the loss to the exchequer at crores of rupees. They said transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury had recently noticed a large number of touts in the offices of the transport authorities. He had instructed us to keep the touts at bay, said an official.        
	According to regulations, an applicant should fill up the challan and deposit the money with the RBI. The challan must then be deposited with the transport department for acquiring a new permit. However, in most cases, touts carry out the procedure for a fee.         
	Asked about the probe, chief secretary Ashok Mohan Chakrabarti said: I am not aware of the issue. Let me first find out what has happened.        
	Minister Kundu said prima facie it appeared that the fraud was restricted to permits for buses. However, we cant be sure. We will run a thorough check for all kinds of commercial vehicles, including trucks and taxis, he said.        
	Kundu added he had asked his department officials to check both the local permits and the all-India permits issued recently.

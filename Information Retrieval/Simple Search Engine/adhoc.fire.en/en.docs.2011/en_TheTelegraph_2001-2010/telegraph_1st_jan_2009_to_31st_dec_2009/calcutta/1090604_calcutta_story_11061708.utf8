	Every photograph tells a story. This is the message traveller and photographer David Trattles from Canada is trying to impart to his 30 charges at a photography workshop by Peaceworks, an initiative of Seagull Foundation for the Arts.         
	From May 15, he has been teaching students from city schools the basics of photography. If their photographs are anything to go by, they seemed to have learned well.         
	Take the one of two young boys in a convulsive fit of laughter, or a face, disjointed from the rest of the body, with a grimy road behind and cloudy skies above.         
	Participation is free and the students have been given digital cameras for the workshop.         
	Paired with those from different economic backgrounds and religious faiths, they were asked to photograph their partners dream.         
	My partner, Bidisha Das, dreams of becoming a filmmaker. So, I took pictures of her with her camera on the streets, said Jaya Vishwakarma, a Class IX student of Adarsh Hindi Girls High School. Jaya, on the other hand, wants to be a teacher. So Bidisha photographed her teaching children at an NGO.         
	The participants, from 14 to 18 years of age, also visited the Howrah flower market. Bidisha, a Class XII student of Patha Bhavan, has taken photographs of the flower-sellers.         
	I wanted to show how flowers are turned into jewellery, used as adornment and for worship, she said.         
	Trattles, who has travelled through 60 countries on a bicycle, had earlier photographed women boxers in the city. Photography is a process. The pictures are the end product, but the process is as important, he said.         
	The students current assignment is to take photographs of their favourite things.         
	The purpose of the workshop, says Indrani Roy, coordinator of Peaceworks in schools, is to make young people tolerant of difference. Bringing children of varied backgrounds together will help foster tolerance at the individual level, she feels.         
	The workshop, to continue till June 27, will culminate in an exhibition at the Peaceworks Festival organised by Seagull every year.

	Nine thousand participants from 400 schools vied to become the most promising pace bowler at the Dabur Glucose-D TTIS Ace of Pace contest. One each from the junior (classes VI to IX) and the senior (classes X to XII) teams were selected as the winners, based on the maximum number of wickets taken in an over.         
	Apart from schools and cricket coaching camps in Purulia, Bankura, Durgapur, Asansol, Siliguri, Midnapore and Calcutta, the search also included students through a wild-card entry.         
	The final was held at Spring Club on May 23. The lucky two won a date with pace bowler Zaheer Khan and a chance to train at the Videocon School of Cricket in Salt Lake for a month.        
	RONY MITRA  
	For this 18-year-old, cricket comes before studies. My parents dont mind if I miss school, but get very angry when I miss practice, says the youngster, who wants to take up cricket as a career. The Siliguri boys strength is the outswinger, though he also contributes as a middle-order batsman.         
	The student of Tarapada Adarsha High School trains at the Agragami Cricket Coaching Centre six days a week and dreams of joining Team India.         
	Such competitions are a big opportunity for people from smaller cities, says Rony, who plans to pick up tips from Zaheer Khan.         
	PRITAM CHAKRABORTY  
	The student of St Thomas Church School, Howrah, has been balancing studies with cricket for the past seven years. The 14-year-old, who practises at the Badal Bose Memorial Cricket Academy, has been trained by his father, a coach at the club. The all-rounders strength is the inswinger.        
	The fan of Sachin Tendulkar and Brett Lee is very excited about meeting Zaheer Khan. I want to ask him how he makes an old ball swing, he smiles.

	Peppy tricks to break the ice                  Magician Shyamal Kumar teaches a card trick to participants at the magic workshop. Picture by Anindya Shankar Ray      
	Sixteen-year-old Anubhab Chatterjee can make a coin or a mobile phone vanish in the blink of an eye. Class V student Soojata Gan can impress grown-ups with her expertise in card tricks.         
	These youngsters were introduced to sleight-of-hand at a daylong workshop organised by magician Shyamal Kumar of the Society of Amateur Magicians on May 24 at Aneek Mancha, on the Salt Lake stadium campus.         
	For a fee of Rs 150, the 30 participants, ranging from classes IV to X, were taught the secrets of tricks like making a handkerchief vanish and threading a needle without touching it .         
	If you are trying to make new friends, magic can be a great ice-breaker. With a simple coin trick, you can become the centre of attention in a group, said Mrityunjoy Saha, a Class X student of Don Bosco, Bandel.         
	The workshop began with a blaze started on the stage, which was then transformed into flowers.         
	The popularity of such workshops has greatly increased over the years, claims Kumar. I had to turn away children from states like Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, he said.         
	I learnt the voodoo trick this time. I also brushed up the tricks I had learnt earlier, said Anubhab, a Class X student of Garden High School, who has been attending the workshop for three years now.         
	In the voodoo trick, a person leaves the impression of his hand on a piece of paper using paint, explained Kumar. When a part of the impression on the paper is burnt away, the mark shows up on the persons hand.        
	Magic need no longer be an unremunerative hobby, feels Kumar. With magic shows becoming a must at office and birthday parties, there are many opportunities, he says.         
	The day came to an end with the participants putting up a show for their guardians, showcasing what they had learnt in the course of the day. The show helps them get a taste of performing before an audience, said Kumar who has been conducting such workshops for the past four years.

	I think I am a voyeur. I realise this every time I am stuck at one of Calcuttas traffic signals, waiting for the lights to change. Unfortunately, my life is a bit different from James Stuarts in Rear Window.         
	I am not a magazine photographer, with one of my legs in a cast, being doted upon by the stunning Grace Kelly. But, like him, I too am content to play the role of the passive observer. Stuart had his binocular to indulge his obsession. My voyeurism is aided by the pole-like structure at crossings that have three blinking eyes.        
	Traffic lights are points of stillness around which life is played out in a series of nearly imperceptible acts. There is always a furtive quality about this action, as well as the desire to transgress acceptable boundaries of human conduct. These innocuous poles, surrounded by the low hum of waiting cars, encourage us to bare our inner lives momentarily. There is untold pleasure in watching this metaphorical act of stripping, in watching people watching others, and, in turn, being watched by them.        
	And what do these solitary, frozen moments reveal? Often, it is the interplay of desire and revulsion, of triumph and defeat.         
	Once, I had watched a middle-aged woman stare at a man much younger than her at a signal. Her car window was rolled down, and in spite of the lines around her eyes, I could see that she had once been pretty. There was no doubt that she liked what she saw. The young man, sitting on a bike beside her, enjoyed her attention initially. His eyes shifted from the mirror on his bike to the woman. The woman continued staring, her lips curled in a faint smile, and the man grew uncomfortable. He started to fidget on his seat, and looked around to see whether anyone was watching what was taking place. Finally, with a signal from the cop, he sped away. I wonder what made him leave in haste. Was it because of being desired by a woman with lines around her eyes?        
	Another time, I had seen a big car purring at the lights. There were three people in it: the sleeping groom, his young bride and the driver. The groom had his eyes closed, and his mouth slightly open. The woman watched him with a look of dread, while the driver watched her in the rearview mirror with brazen longing.        
	I had also seen a man controlling traffic once. He was not a policeman, but one of those people who appear at bottlenecks and, with their flailing arms, direct the vehicles, often with disastrous consequences. On this occasion, even though the lights had turned green, the man stood in the middle of the road, his hands raised in that unmistakable gesture of asking drivers to stay put.         
	A few minutes later, the people driving saw through his ruse, revved and left, leaving the content man reflecting on his triumph of having halted a fleet of machines.         
	Voyeurism is alluring, not only because it opens a secret passage into other, unsuspecting, lives but also because it lends the voyeur the power to re-imagine other lives and relationships in the manner he or she craves. The business of looking, and being looked at, in private is thus always selfish and delightfully twisted.        
	Ours is a republic of voyeurs. We not only watch others secure in private settings, but even while we inhabit the most public of spaces.        
	What I like watching the most is how the faces change the moment the traffic lights turn green. Men and women, who had exchanged glances, and delighted in a shared guilt, turn their faces away and pretend as if nothing had happened. Only the traffic signal knows what had passed between them. It is a collector of stories that are never told.

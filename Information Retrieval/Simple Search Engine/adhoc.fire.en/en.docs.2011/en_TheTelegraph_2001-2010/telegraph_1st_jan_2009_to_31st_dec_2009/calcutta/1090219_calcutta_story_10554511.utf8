                                                                                                               Katatel fire marks green auto drive

	Keys to 52 new LPG autorickshaws were handed over to the owners at Garia on Wednesday, hours after katatel stocked in a shanty at an adjacent auto stand went up in flames, damaging the roof of a sawmill.         
	Sunderbans development minister Kanti Ganguly and mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya inaugurated the autos at a programme organised by the South 24-Parganas District Auto Rickshaw Operators Union, affiliated to the Citu, on Raja SC Mullick Road. The green autos will ply on the Garia-Gariahat route.         
	Ganguly said the government would make an all-out effort to replace the old autos. The mayor criticised those handling the issue for not considering the financial condition of the auto drivers and their family members.        
	Around 6am, the fire broke out in a shanty at the Garia stand of the Garia-Tollygunge Metro station auto route, where several jerrycans of katatel had been stored. The blaze spread to the adjoining sawmill.        
	Premji Patel, the owner of the mill, reached the spot within minutes and found the roof in flames. Some auto drivers were trying to douse the fire. Shortly, two tenders reached the spot and put out the blaze.        
	The incident gave residents of the densely populated area a scare.         
	We were quite nervous because if the flames had spread further it would have been quite difficult for us to save ourselves. Moreover, several autos were parked in the stand, said Swapan Das, a resident.        
	A preliminary investigation by the firemen suggested that the katatel had fuelled the blaze. A cigarette stub might have sparked the flames, said a fireman.

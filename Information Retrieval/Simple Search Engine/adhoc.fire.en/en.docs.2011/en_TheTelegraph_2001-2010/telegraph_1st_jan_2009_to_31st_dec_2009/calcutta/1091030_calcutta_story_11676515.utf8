The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Knee-jerk drive against hawkers
                                                                                                               Knee-jerk drive against hawkers
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The mayor met the police commissioner on Thursday to discuss a joint drive to remove hawkers wares left on the footpaths at night.        
	We have decided to start an operation at night to remove all permanent structures from footpaths. Hawkers, too, will not be allowed to keep their goods on the footpath after business hours. The operation will start soon, said Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya after the meeting.         
	According to him, the civic body and police will also intensify raids to reduce the chaos on the footpaths. Hawkers wont be allowed to occupy more than a third of a pavement. The drive will be conducted on a war footing, the mayor said.        
	A high court order last Friday asking the government to file within a fortnight a report on the parking and pavement chaos in the central business district has prompted the drive.        
	This is not the first time the civic body and police have teamed up against hawkers. After several such operations in the past, hawkers had managed to return to encroach on the pavements allegedly with the blessings of the civic body, police and political parties.        
	The occasional eviction campaigns are an eyewash. The hawker-police-politician nexus is strong enough to defeat any drive to clear the pavements, said a civic official.         
	The civic rules allow hawkers to occupy up to a third of a pavement, at least 50 metres from a crossing. The majority of the 2.5 lakh hawkers in the city have been flouting the norms daily with the backing of the authorities. Its a political issue and everybody has a stake, said an officer of New Market police station.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Noise norm flout on festive eve
                                                                                                               Noise norm flout on festive eve
  - Tight vigil to battle terror threat and banned crackers          OUR BUREAU                                    
	Noise norms are set to go for a toss yet again if Friday night was an indication.        
	Rampant explosion of crackers across the city on Diwali-eve proved true the apprehension that banned crackers had been smuggled into the city from districts.        
	Fearing the influx, police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti had recently written to the director-general of police, Bhupinder Singh: All efforts may kindly be made to seize banned fireworks in the districts adjoining Calcutta, otherwise it will be well nigh impossible either to stop their entry into Calcutta or to prevent these banned fireworks from being used.         
	Surojit Kar Purkayastha, the inspector-general of police (law and order), said vigil had been stepped up on problem spots. We seized 3,000kg of banned fireworks from the two 24-Parganas and Howrah in the past week, he said.        
	The South 24-Parganas administration had allowed manufacture of some banned crackers that were to be sold outside the state. Purkayastha said some of these crackers might have illegally entered the Bengal market.        
	Senior officers at Lalbazar denied any banned cracker had been exploded on Friday. No one has been arrested, said an officer.

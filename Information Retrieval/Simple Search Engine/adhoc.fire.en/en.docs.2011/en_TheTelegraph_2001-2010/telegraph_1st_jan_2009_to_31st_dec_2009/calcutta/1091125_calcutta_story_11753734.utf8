The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Shes a taxi driver with a difference
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Shes a taxi driver with a difference
          SAMHITA CHAKRABORTY LAHIRI                          Papia Ganguly gets ready to answer a passenger call in her cool cab. Picture by Anindya Shankar Ray                                  
	When she first told her husband what she wanted to do, he thought she had gone mad. When she broke the news to her father he threatened to commit suicide.        
	Five years on, Papia Ganguly is happily pursuing her dream and her husband and father are so proud of the the only woman driver of a radio taxi in town.        
	The 38-year-old drives a Blue Arrow air-conditioned Indica and brings home around Rs 20,000 a month.        
	Only my son (in Class VIII) is not too happy with my job, but I am sure he will understand when he is a little older, shrugs Papia, who is also the secretary of the Air-conditioned Taxi Association.        
	The graduate and diploma holder in astrology had earlier tried her luck as a life insurance agent and a medical representative.        
	I was never inclined to do a 9 to 5 job and my earlier professions didnt really take off. Then I saw an advertisement in the paper from Blue Arrow inviting applications from woman drivers, and thought why not? recalls Papia, at her Kankurgachhi home.        
	Hard times had hit home after her husband took VRS from a private firm and Papia, who had learnt driving at a motor training school as a hobby, decided to slip into the drivers seat.        
	The start wasnt smooth. The first two months, I had zero income as I had to pay the company a hefty fee for using their vehicle. But I was determined to succeed and my perseverance paid off. There were days when I would get only three to four hours of sleep, says Papia, who is now the proud owner of two yellow taxis that she rents out.        
	I received a lot of help and encouragement from my employers and colleagues. I wasnt a great driver initially and didnt know the roads of Calcutta well. Traffic cops were a big help too, she smiles.        
	Didnt she feel scared driving strangers around town, sometimes at odd hours of the day or night? Never, she announces. Calcutta is a safe city and I never feel unsafe with my passengers.        
	Papia strikes up a rapport with most of her passengers, and today she has a long list of those who insist on being driven around by her.        
	Visitors from other Indian cities, Bangladesh, and even Germany call me up before arriving in Calcutta to book my cab, she says, her eyes shining with the satisfaction of a job well done.        
	Regular passengers keep her so busy that she often spends days without stopping for strangers. She doesnt mind long-haul assignments, either. I have driven to Asansol, Digha, Jharkhand and enjoyed it, says the cabbie with a penchant for poetry  she recites often and pens occasionally.        
	Calcutta, of course, remains curious about the driver with a difference.         
	Passengers are intrigued the first time I turn up when they call for a cab. I have to answer their questions, much like you are asking me now, she smiles.        
	Any tips for those who want to be like her? It is very important for women to be independent. This profession is good, but they must be careful and maintain their dignity.

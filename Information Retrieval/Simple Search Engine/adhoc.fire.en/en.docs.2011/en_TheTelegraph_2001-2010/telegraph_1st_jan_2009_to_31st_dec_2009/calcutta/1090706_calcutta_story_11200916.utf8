                      An all-consuming passion                    As part of an effort by artists and educators in Mauritius to promote Hindi language and Indian culture through the medium of poems, stories and theatre, Triveni Kala Mandir, a 14-member troupe from Mauritius, presents Raja Aur Rani, a Hindi adaptation of Rabindranath Tagores play Raja O Rani. To be performed for the first time in India, it is expected to find favour with critics and theatre-lovers alike, who will find in it an entertaining mix of romance, tension and violence, along with an interesting contrast of characters. The story about King Vikrama is made all the more absorbing with the addition of an intricately-woven sub-plot, enlivened by intrigue. Its central theme is about the futility of selfish and egocentric love, as King Vikrama neglects his royal duties in his passionate attachment with his Queen. It describes how love, a devouring passion, can cause nothing but tragedy, unless it is chastened by its obligation to humanity. The conflict in the play is between love and duty; between a vain, infatuated man and a proud, humane woman. Direction: Balraj Ramphul.

                                                                                                               EC misses restoration deadline
          A STAFF REPORTER                      Bamboo poles clutter the greens of National Library on Sunday afternoon.				               Holes drilled into the greens have not been filled; (right) two of   the six broken lamps have not been repaired            Garbage has been dumped behind the canteen, raising a horrible stench.

	The clean-up deadline has come and gone but the National Library premises lie scarred and soiled.        
	The Election Commission had requisitioned the library till May 23. They should clear the place and replace whatever has been damaged immediately, K.K. Banerjee, the director of National Library, said on Sunday.        
	When Metro visited the Alipore campus on Sunday afternoon  more than 12 hours after the Election Commission was supposed to have restored the library premises to its pre-poll state  there was no sign of the poll panel taking the deadline seriously.        
	Bamboo sticks were dumped on the greens, the steps and a portion of the road. The greens were littered with waste paper, saal-leaf plates, earthen cups and plastic cups, and bore gaping holes caused by the bamboo poles to erect tents. Two of the six lamps that were broken by the poll marauders have not been restored and three large earthen flowerpots lie in pieces.        
	Contract labourers have also played foul by gathering filth and dumping it behind the canteen, causing an eyesore and a horrible stench.        
	We have closed all the windows but the stench is still unbearable, said a member of the canteen staff.        
	On May 15, chief electoral officer Debasish Sen had met the library director and promised clean-up, repair and restoration within the deadline. Sen could not be reached on Sunday night.        
	Banerjee said an inspection would be conducted and the commission alerted about the pending work.

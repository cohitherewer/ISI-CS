	Shakuntala with a cause
  - PUPPET SHOW and a GREEN message
    
	Sebanti Sarkar        
	Padmagatha, a puppet show directed and designed by puppeteer Sudip Gupta and his Dolls Theatre troupe, will be formally launched in the city this November after doing the rounds of several north Indian cities.         
	Sponsored by Spicmacay, that promotes culture among students, the show uses snippets from the tale of Raja Dushmantya and Shakuntala to convey an environmental message.                    The puppet Shakuntala as Dushmantya rsquo;s beloved in the puppet show, Padmagatha, to be staged by Doll rsquo;s Theatre in November              
	We will be playing at various regional schools and colleges, so we have done away with dialogue, said Sudip Gupta, who presented Naak Kata Raja, on the childrens story by Upendrakishore Ray Choudhury, last year.         
	A simpler version of Padmagatha had been done before, but this time a lot more has been incorporated, with the story being endowed with a green message, explained Gupta.        
	The show will be replete in song, dance, music and sound effects.         
	Three puppets are used for the different stages of Shakuntalas life  as a baby found by sages inside a lotus, as a young girl nurtured by the forest and as Dushmantyas beloved. Most puppets measure four or five feet, except Raja Dushmantyas, which is eight feet tall.         
	This is to convey his power, ambition and anti-nature tendencies. The doe-eyed Shakuntala, on the other hand, is in various shades of green, as she represents nature.        
	Dushmantya and his hunters unleash death and destruction on the animals in the forest for fun. Flaming torches and shadow puppets are used to give a vision of this horror. When Dushmantya kills Shakuntalas favourite deer, she rejects him by throwing the garland that he had given her into the river.         
	The puppeteers (Gupta, Surajit Dey, Pijush Purokait, Kaushik Das, Mandira Banerjee, Soumi Banerjee, Soumen Chakraborty, Barun Kar, Nitai Hembrem) often join the puppets as actors.         
	The puppet Shakuntalas close friends are two girls, while it is the puppeteers who greet the infant Shakuntala and later express fear at the impending marriage of Shakuntala and Dushmantya.        
	Dolls Theatre has always tried to celebrate the bond between Nature and Man, performing in Iran, Israel, Spain and all over India, said Gupta, who has over two decades experience in the medium.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mercedes eyes a ton in town
                                                                                                               Mercedes eyes a ton in town
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	A 100 new Mercedes Benzes may roll out in the city this year with the German company lining up back-to-back launches in the festive season.        
	We are confident of a 20 per cent increase over last years sales, said Hiteswar Singh, the CEO of Interkrafts, the sole Mercedes dealer in the city.         
	That will catapult the dealer to the 100 cars mark. It has sold 82 units last year and has done 47 till mid-2009.        
	Mercs nearest rival, BMW, which started operations in 2007, is close to touching the 100 mark in the city in September, said company sources.        
	Singh was speaking at the launch of the Mercedes C Class Special Edition at a city hotel. The petrol variant of the C Class Special Edition is priced at Rs 30.4 lakh and the diesel version at Rs 33.69 lakh (both prices ex-showroom, Calcutta).        
	Mercs confidence stems from the impending launch of the new generation E Class, the bread-and-butter vehicle for the company. The E Class sales was at its lowest this year since this is its seventh year. We have phased it out, said Debashis Mitra, the director (sales amp; marketing) of Mercedes-Benz India.         
	The C-Class Special Edition will also shore up numbers, with 60 models available across the country for sale.        
	Once it reaches the 100-mark figure, Interkrafts will move from its Alipore Road outlet to a larger showroom, said Singh. We are in the process of identifying the site, said Singh. Interkrafts has upgraded and expanded its workshop in Behala that is equipped to handle all Merc operations till 2012.        
	BMW, too, is set to launch Z4, a rear wheel drive sports car expected to be priced at Rs 62-65 lakh.

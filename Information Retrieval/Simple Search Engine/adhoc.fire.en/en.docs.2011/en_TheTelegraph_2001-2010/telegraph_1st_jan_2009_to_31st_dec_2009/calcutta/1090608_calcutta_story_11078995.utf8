                      Vignettes of feminine mystery                    The artist is a receptacle for emotions that come from all over the place; from the sky, from the earth, from a scrap of paper, from a passing shape, from a spiders web  Pablo Picasso.        Gwalior-based artist Mustak Khan Chowdhury says he derives inspiration from his surroundings. He visits the Gwalior Fort daily and thats how the images of archaeological structure and related mysterious elements emerge in his paintings with symbolic overtones. This post-graduate painter from Visva Bharati, Santiniketan has been painting since late 1980s, and has participated in innumerable solo and group shows, both in India and abroad. Chowdhury is a figurative artist and his works are influenced by religious mythology, inequities and atrocities perpetrated on women in our society. His recent works depict interesting vignettes of women: their thoughts and how they react to different situations. He is particularly fond of emphasising on the mythological powers of women. He uses bright red, blue, yellow and sepia colours in his paintings. In the present series, he has used acrylic and oil pastels on canvas to create a rich and bright effect, and watercolour, oil pastels and charcoal on paper to create a textural effect.

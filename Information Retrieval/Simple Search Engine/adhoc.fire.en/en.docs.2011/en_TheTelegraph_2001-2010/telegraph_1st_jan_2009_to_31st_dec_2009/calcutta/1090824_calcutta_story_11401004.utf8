          A STAFF REPORTER                          Alipore Central jail. (A Telegraph picture)                                  
	A cellphone jammer installed at Alipore Central jail in 2007 by spending lakhs has not worked since Day One.        
	The decision to install the jammer to stop inmates from using cellphones was taken in 2006. It was set up at a cost of Rs 17.98 lakh the next year.        
	The agency which installed the jammer was asked to repair it but nothing was done, said a jail official. According to jail sources, experts were engaged last year to repair the jammer, but they failed to do so.         
	The chief auditor general mentioned about the defunct jammer in his annual report.         
	Prisoners in the city jails have often been found to be using cellphones, with the help of jail warders. In a recent raid, city cops had seized cellphones and SIM cards from the cells of dreaded criminals at Alipore Central jail.         
	If a businessman gets a threat call from a dreaded extortionist who is lodged in jail, will he dare to lodge a police complaint? asked an officer of the detective department. According to him, extortionist Bachha Mehtab had masterminded an attack on cellphone shop-owner on Marquis Street while lodged in Alipore jail.        
	A cellphone was found on extortionist Mohammad Shahjada as he was entering Alipore jail after being produced in court. A probe revealed that Shahjada had been running his gang from jail.        
	Additional director-general (jail) B.D. Sharma refused comment.

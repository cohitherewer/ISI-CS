	Dhriti Malhotra tossed a currency note into a fire, but it did not burn. Astha Seth cut her hand with a knife, but she was not bruised.         
	I dipped the currency note into a solution of ethyl alcohol (nail polish) and water. As ethyl alcohol is volatile, it vapourises fast and the ignition temperature of the paper is not reached. So it does not burn, explained Dhriti.         
	Astha had a lime hidden in the palm of her hand. Potassium permanganate, when mixed with citric acid, produces a red colour. This is how they show blood in television, she explained.         
	These simple experiments were part of a two-day science exhibition, titled Anveshan, organised by Akshar, an inclusive school for children with and without disabilities, on June 25 and 26.         
	Former University Grants Commission chairman Yash Pal, the chief guest, made a round of the rooms, asking questions to students manning the counters. He quizzed one on the properties that make a substance acidic or basic.         
	Children in a room called the Open Basic Education Room displayed how green and red light mix to produce yellow light. The room emphasised the colour green as a reminder of the importance of the environment.         
	Other attractions included a description of the planets by the tiny tots, and a song and poetry presentation on planets to celebrate 150 years of astronomy. One could travel in space with a student dressed as Galileo as guide through a model of a space shuttle, or take a walk through a giant model of the human ear.         
	Kaleidoscopes, pin-hole cameras and optical illusions demonstrated the various principles of light.         
	Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy, a participant at the exhibition, displayed instruments for those with hearing difficulties.         
	An exhibition or a stage show has been a part of the school calendar for the past six years. Every year has a different theme, like Einstein, world travel and newspapers. This year, we focussed on science, in connection with literature and environment, said Neena Singh, the executive director of Akshar.  The topic was decided in May and the students did the research work during the vacations. The final display was put together in 15 days, she added.         
	Prizes were given away in the evening of Day I for general efficiency and good conduct. The evening started with a debate on the subject, success depends on opportunity and not character. Class IV-A bagged the prize for reading the maximum number of books in the year.

	Whats on your mind this week        
	SHOUT OUT LOUD

	What would a world without women be like?   
	What about the housework? How many men cook, scrub, sweep, clean up and look after kids?         
	The fashion weeks would be great flops and God knows what would happen to Gucci, Chanel or Armani! It would mean no Taj Mahal, no tragic love stories, like Shakespeares Romeo and Juliet or Kalidass Shakuntala. And what remains of epics like the Ramayana and the Illiad, with no Sita or Helen to fight for?

	The report Cyclone aid steers students to the fore, June 30, had mentioned that the St Xaviers College Calcutta Alumni Association had approached several organisations for Aila relief. Ex-students of the college had participated in the effort and not the association.         
	The error is regretted.

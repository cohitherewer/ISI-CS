          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 70-year-old Uttar Pradesh resident was found dead on Friday morning on a central Calcutta pavement, below the nursing home room where he was shifted after a cataract surgery on Thursday.         
	Preliminary investigation indicated that Mangal Ram Gon had jumped through a second-floor window of the Prafulla Sarkar Street nursing home. We are investigating whether there was any provocation, said a police officer.        
	Gon was staying with his daughter in her north Calcutta house before he was admitted to the nursing home for the surgery.         
	His relatives lodged a complaint with Bowbazar police station alleging that he died because of negligence on the part of the nursing home.        
	Pedestrians spotted the body around 6am outside the compound of the nursing home. One of the windows of the room where Gon was staying was open. Nursing home officials said all the windows were shut on Thursday night.

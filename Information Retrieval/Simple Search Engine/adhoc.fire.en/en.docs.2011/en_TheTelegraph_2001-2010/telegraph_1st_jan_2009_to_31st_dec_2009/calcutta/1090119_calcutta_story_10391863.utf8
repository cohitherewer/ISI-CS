The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bird count dips in choked water body
                                                                                                               Bird count dips in choked water body
          ROMILA SAHA                          Birds at the Santragachhi jheel. (Sanat Kumar Sinha)                                  
	Fewer birds have made the Santragachhi jheel their home this winter. Overgrowth of water hyacinth in the 13,75,000sq ft lake, the largest hub of waterfowl around the city, could be one of the reasons, according to experts.         
	Last year, 5,152 migratory and local birds were counted at the jheel, said Kushal Mookherjee of NGO Prakriti Samsad, which conducts the annual Asian Waterfowl Census. This year, we have counted only 2,581 birds so far.        
	Many of the birds, like the Red Crested Pochard and the Northern Pintail, fly thousands of kilometres across the Himalayas to roost here.        
	The forest department is responsible for removing excess water hyacinth from the lake and tying up the plants with bamboo poles and ropes to create islands for the birds to roost.        
	We had started work in April last year. The water hyacinth has grown back very fast in the past two months, said the assistant divisional forest officer (Howrah and Hooghly division), Pradip Dutta.        
	Water hyacinth provides a resting surface for birds but it must be present in the right ratio, explained Mookherjee.        
	This season, much less water hyacinth was cleared compared with last winter. The plants were dumped along the banks. The bamboo poles were not laid out properly, said resident Arup Saha. Waste dumped into the lake from houses dotting the banks had not been cleared either, he added.        
	Cleaning is supposed to stop by the time the birds start arriving in October. But it inevitably continues even after they start coming, said Mookherjee.        
	Fifty birds flew off after arriving at the jheel because of the disturbance, said a regular birder at Santragachhi.

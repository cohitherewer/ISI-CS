	The Indian Botanic Garden has escaped Cyclone Aila lightly with only about 40 of its 40,000 trees and plants being uprooted.         
	By the grace of god, we have escaped the worst, said the joint director of the garden, Girija Shankar Giri, on Wednesday.        
	Most of the trees uprooted were over 50 years old, he added. One such tree, a giant mahogany, lay sprawled across the path leading to the office of the garden director, with some of its roots under the soil and the rest suspended in the air.        
	The tree-fall count was less in the Agri-Horticultural Society of India compound in Alipore.        
	Twenty trees were uprooted and almost all the plants suffered some damage, said S.L. Rahman, the joint secretary of the society.        
	In both gardens, only mahogany, jarul, palm and a few other types of trees fell to the storm. Most of these were over 50ft tall.         
	The storm struck terror in the heart of employees of the Shibpur garden. As giant branches swayed and snapped, they along with visitors ran for cover.        
	It was really very scary in the garden, said A.K. Das, a garden official. He pointed to the 50ft tall pankud tree most of whose branches were broken and left dangling by the storm. One couldnt see through the foliage earlier.        
	The damaged trees at the southern end of the garden provided cover to those inside, including the centuries-old Great Banyan Tree. The banyan tree did not suffer a single damage, said Giri.         
	While garden officials surveyed the damage, the joint director chaired meetings to improve the drainage network underground.        
	Its time to rebuild and regenerate. We have saplings of the species of trees that have been uprooted and we will plant them soon, said Giri.        
	Giant trees with shallow roots were prey to the storms. The taper root of a 50ft tall tree should also go down 50ft to keep the tree stable, explained Das. This is possible in a forest, and to some effect in a garden. But it is also necessary to tend to the trees, keep them pruned so that the centre of gravity remains in place.        
	According to garden officials, plants that do not grow in their natural habitat are also vulnerable to storms. Mahogany, for instance, is not a native species. It usually grows in mountainous regions and have been transplanted here. It will not have its natural growth here, said Giri.        
	A gardener had his own take. The topsoil is moist in the garden so trees do not develop deep roots as they get moisture from the surface itself.

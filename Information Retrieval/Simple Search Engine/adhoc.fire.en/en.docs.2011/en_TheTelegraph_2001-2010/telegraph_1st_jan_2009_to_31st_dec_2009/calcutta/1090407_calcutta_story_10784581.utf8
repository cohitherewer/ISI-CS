The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mother, baby die in hut blaze
                                                                                                               Mother, baby die in hut blaze
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Nine-month-old Tuhin                                  
	A nine-month-old boy and his mother died after their room in the Kalabagan slum caught fire on Monday morning. The father of the baby was admitted to SSKM Hospital with 75 per cent burns.        
	Police said Debasis Naskar, 22, and Minu, 21, were sleeping with their son Tuhin in their 10ft x 10ft room on Alipore Road when it caught fire. The room was locked from the inside, hence it took the neighbours a long time to rescue them, said an officer.        
	It appears the fire started from a short-circuit. A forensic team would visit the spot on Tuesday to confirm the cause of the fire, he added.        
	Around 5.30am, residents of the slum woke up to the cries of the family. We broke the lock and brought them out but they were already in flames, said Suresh Roy, a neighbour.        
	Three tenders took half an hour to douse the blaze. The police rushed the three to hospital. The baby was declared dead on arrival, while Minu was admitted with 80 per cent burns. She died in the evening, the officer said.        
	Debasis works as a mechanic in a garage and his parents also live with him. My parents are visiting a relative, said Debasiss sister Tapasi Halder.

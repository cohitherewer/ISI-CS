	Area-wise property tax, under which house owners in prime locations will pay more than those in other parts, is set to be introduced in the city.        
	The West Bengal Municipal Corporation (Amendment) Bill, 2009, which contains provisions for the new tax code, was passed in the Assembly on Tuesday. We are thinking of starting it (area-wise property tax) on an experimental basis in Calcutta, but not in the rest of the state now, said municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya.        
	Over the past 50 years, tax has been calculated on the basis of the notional rent a flat or a building could fetch, if let out. The concept is arbitrary and encourages corruption, feel many. Civic inspectors and clerks are often accused of fudging figures if house owners refuse to bribe them.         
	Introduction of area-wise tax was one of the conditions set by the Asian Development Bank before it sanctioned a $220-million loan to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation in December 2001 for the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project. The launch of the new tax code was pushed back a number of times since then.         
	A committee, comprising a deputy municipal commissioner of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation and representatives of the Institute of Surveyors and Valuers, National Institute of Urban Studies and the Indian Statistical Institute, Calcutta, had been set up to break up the 187sq km city municipal area into blocks, based on valuation of land.

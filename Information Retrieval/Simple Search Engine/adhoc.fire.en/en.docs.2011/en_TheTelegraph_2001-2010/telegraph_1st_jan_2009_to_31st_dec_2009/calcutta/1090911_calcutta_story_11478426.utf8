The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mobile muzzle on college campus
                                                                                                               Mobile muzzle on college campus
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Beware, the beep of the SMS and the beat of the playlist in classrooms and corridors. For, many colleges are taking a cue from the recent blanket ban on cellphones by the CBSE and toughening their stand.        
	Muralidhar Girls College has made a move this week to muzzle the mobile. The Gariahat college had issued a notice a few weeks ago telling students not to use cellphones. With students turning a deaf ear to the notice, the college issued a fresh one on Tuesday.        
	This time enforcement will be strict. Students can bring their phones to college but if they are caught using them we will seize them, warned principal Manjusha Tarafdar.        
	There is no point teaching a class if the majority of students are busy texting. Also, students loiter in the corridors listening to music with earplugs and do not even acknowledge the presence of teachers.... So we have decided that cellphones can only be used in an emergency on the college premises, she added.        
	Many other colleges like Asutosh, Shri Shikshayatan, Scottish Church, Maulana Azad, Jogamaya Devi and New Alipore have banned the use of cellphones outside designated zones like canteens and common rooms.        
	Students across campuses seemed set in their opposition to a blanket ban on cellphones. Banning cellphones in schools is one thing, but in colleges quite another. Many of us do part-time jobs and it is impossible for us not to stay connected throughout the day, grumbled Priyanshu Roy, a second-year student of a south Calcutta college.        
	Added Sushma Agarwal, a first-year student: We are responsible enough to keep our cellphones on silent and just check for texts and missed calls between classes. I see no harm in that.        
	Principals and teachers are not convinced. We used to confiscate cellphones and return them at the end of the third year. But now we are slapping a penalty of Rs 1,000 and calling the guardians before handing over confiscated cellphones, said Anuradha Banerjee, the principal of Shri Shikshayatan.        
	At Scottish Church College, where the use of the cell is forbidden outside the canteen and common room, students caught flouting the rule have their phones seized. They can reclaim the phone for Rs 200. This has reduced cellphone usage considerably, said principal John Abraham.        
	At St Xaviers College, using cellphones in the corridors and classrooms is a strict no-no.

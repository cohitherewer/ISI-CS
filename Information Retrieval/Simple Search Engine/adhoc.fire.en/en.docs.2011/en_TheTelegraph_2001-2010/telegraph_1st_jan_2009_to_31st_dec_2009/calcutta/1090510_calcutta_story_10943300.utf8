The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Voters diary 
                                                                                                               Voters diary 
  - A veteran of many elections dwells on the choices today                                                
	Time was when I tended to agree Parliament was a pigsty with a half-moon seating arrangement. A clever friend  it was also the time when a subterranean rivalry consumed our collective life with each trying to act smarter than the other  said: Why insult pigs? Think of Keventers ham. Alas, Keventers on Lindsay Street is no more.         
	Just as the soul that felt vote was a four-letter word was soon to be no more. From one four-letter word, vote became another  duty, a democratic duty.         
	Now Im a veteran of many votes. Wars I would have said, had it not been just the transition from ballot to button, like pen to pendrive. Voting has never been a problem  were a family of conscientious exercisers of franchise.         
	Even if Im secure in the belief that the candidate will win or lose whether or not I make the trip to the booth, Ill be dragged there to wallow in the company of the perfumed and the unwashed masses. Democracys rare, even hand visible if only on this day, and even if only in the queue.         
	Focus: Immediate        
	It felt good to be among people this one day in five years, unified by a sole purpose, but otherwise so fractious, so resentful of the existence of the other. I liked voting, as do most Calcuttans as the accompanying The Telegraph-MODE survey shows. They all want to vote, for one reason or another.         
	This year feels different, though. The semi-certainties of yesterday that dragged a half-willing, half-reluctant me to the booth have turned into deadening doubt.         
	Why the doubt, why the whiff of swine-stink again, why does the youthful past come revisiting?         
	I must clarify that this doesnt mean a return to sights of the path one then saw to mans freedom from slavery. This is a different world, ruled by the immediate rather than some distant vision. Which is why even if this is a parliamentary election, from provincial Calcutta it looks very much like Buddhadeb versus Mamata. Or, if you are guided by parties rather than candidates as most Calcuttans seem to be, the CPM against Trinamul. Or, to some, Nandigram versus Singur.         
	The CPM is trying to raise this election beyond the immediate because the immediate is uncomfortable while visions of power in Delhi are illusory enough to be put on billboards high up. Mamata drags the stakes back to this land  Ma, Mati, Manush. The immediate is her strength.         
	Honestly, I find Delhi quite befuddling. When every politician says everything will be clear after May 16 when the results are known, Ive every reason to. As a voter I recoil from such uncertainty and come rushing back to my provincial Calcutta self. No uncertainties here: its Buddha or Mamata.         
	Or is it? Look closely and the choice is not so certain unless youre a victim of the firing in Nandigram or upset that Mamata hasnt wheeled into Singur after driving the Nano out.         
	For most of us urban souls who are not suffering from a sense of political victimhood  a word Im borrowing from Priyanka Gandhi  which is not to be confused with the general feeling of victimhood that sticks to us like much-used underclothing, the choice is not easy. Im not counting the committed minority here. They will vote as they always have.         
	So how do I choose  between Buddha and Mamata? Why, Buddhababu likes Gabriel Garcia Marquez, so do you. True. But that makes us fellow votaries  of Marquez. Not me of Buddha.         
	Next youll say vote Mamata because she can paint, write poetry and sing, too.         
	Dhoti vs sari, red vs green        
	The choice would be easy if they did only those things, all within the four walls of their homes.         
	What separates one from the other, other than the fact that one wears dhoti and the other sari? Other than the fact that one has an almost faint lisp and the other a harsh edge? Other than the fact that one sticks the colour red to the mast and the other green? Other than the fact that one believes farmland needs to be taken for industry and the other will not allow that to happen, though she doesnt have an answer where the factories will be built?         
	Ive reached a deadlock.         
	But I know what an agony this city is and Im not aware if either Buddha or Mamata has any wish, not to talk of a plan, to relieve it. Im not talking about the dirty clogged-up roads. Or about the soot that hangs over the city. Or about the year-old boy who lies next to his mother cooking on the pavement of Amherst Street of an afternoon, his dark skin the colour of the shade the red-brick Marwari Hospital casts. Though I very well could.         
	Or I could talk about Banglar mukh ami dekhiachhi, tai ami/ prithibir roop khunjite jai na aar (I have seen the face of Bengal, I do not wish to seek the beauty of the earth). No, Id rather talk, if I wanted to, about the face of Calcutta that makes me not want to see the face of Bengal any more. Id call her my mother but Im afraid of her oppressive silence. In her world of soundless work from house to house there is only the distant purr of her sons autorickshaw that others cant hear. Though tomorrow arrives with inevitable regularity, theres actually no tomorrow.         
	I could talk about many of these things but Im not sure if Buddha or Mamata has a plan for anything at all. Im just curious: do they have a view on whether fiscal or monetary stimulus or the two together will work in this downturn? Or on climate change? Or on same-sex marriage?         
	Unless I know what you stand for, Buddhababu and Mamatadi, how do I vote?  
	WILL THERE BE A CHANGE IN MY LIFE?  
	 Who rsquo;s interested? Will there be any change in my life if any of these parties come to power? 
  Shreya Basu, MA student 
    I really want a change. As an entrepreneur, I am fed up with the system, with the corruption. 
  Tanaji Dasgupta, Theatre professional 
    But their choices will not reflect the grim reality of the state. There will be no solution to the tribal exploitation, or to the 55,000 closed factories. 
  Nabarun Bhattacharya, author 
    This election is not about Mamata versus Buddha but CPM versus anti-CPM.
  Bibhas Chakraborty, Theatre director and actor 
    Here you have a city that is the cancer capital of the country, it has failed every pollution test, but do the parties have anything to offer on that? 
  Meghna Dass, NGO worker 
    There should be a choice for voters to register their opinion that they would not like to vote for any of the candidates. 
  Sankha Ghosh, poet 
    The interaction of the parties with the public here is very opaque. There should be an intelligent way of interaction as there is in the West. 
  Amit Chaudhuri, author

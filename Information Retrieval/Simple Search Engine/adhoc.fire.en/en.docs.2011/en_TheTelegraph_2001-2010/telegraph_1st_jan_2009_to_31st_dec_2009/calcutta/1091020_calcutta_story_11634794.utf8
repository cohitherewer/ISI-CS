The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Chair-man protest in CM path
                                                                                                               Chair-man protest in CM path
        Power back after convoy block      IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                                        The spot in front of Monojit Bararis 30/2 Broad Street residence, where he had plonked himself on Saturday to protest a 15-hour power outage. The CMs convoy was to take this route (in longer arrow) from his Palm Avenue residence round the corner. (Bishwarup Dutta)          
	A protest at the right time and in the right place can work wonders even in Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees protest-happy Bengal.        
	Monojit Barari, a 58-year-old neighbour of the chief minister, got power restored to his house after a 15-hour blackout last weekend by sitting cross-legged on a chair in the middle of Broad Street to block Bhattacharjees convoy.        
	The ploy worked, leaving the police team in charge of the chief ministers security in a tizzy and forcing senior officers to send an SOS to the CESC control room that had till then failed to attend to Bararis complaints.        
	This (the sit-in protest) was the only option I was left with, and I am happy that it worked, Barari, a BSNL engineer, told Metro on Monday.         
	Passers-by had glanced in amusement and the police glared when Barari, in shorts and T-shirt, plonked himself on the chair in the middle of the 15-foot road around 4.30pm on Saturday, minutes before the chief ministers convoy was to set out for the CPM headquarters on Alimuddin Street.        
	I have called the CESC helpline several times but my problem has not been addressed. Without lights and fans, my ailing mother is in great discomfort. I will not move from here unless power is restored to my home, he shouted back at the policemen when they threatened to arrest him.         
	As residents crowded around Barari to support him, the cops called for help. A team from Karaya police station arrived soon after to lift the blockade but Barari wouldnt budge.        
	Sir, give us an hours time. We will do everything to restore power supply in your house, pleaded an officer.         
	Much to the relief of the police, Barari relented after exactly 18 minutes of protest, but with a rider. I will be forced to resort to extreme measures once again if you fail to keep your word, he told the officers before walking back into his two-storeyed house at 30/2 Broad Street, barely 100 metres from Bhattacharjees residence at 59 Palm Avenue.        
	The chief ministers convoy finally rolled out around 4.50pm, and power supply was restored to Bararis house within 25 minutes.        
	So was the BSNL engineers act inspired by Trinamul leader Partha Chatterjees siege of Bhattacharjees office at Writers Buildings a day earlier?        
	I had no political agenda. My 87-year-old mother is a heart patient and is bedridden. I had no option but to stop the chief ministers convoy, if only to be heard. Had power not been restored quickly, I would have had to shift my mother to a nursing home, said Barari, whose father was an IPS officer who retired as an inspector-general of the BSF.        
	Barari stays in the Broad Street house with his mother, wife Arunima, a bank employee, and their daughter Debolina, a software engineer.         
	An officer at Karaya police station said the cops could have charged Barari with endangering the chief ministers security but chose not to do so because he was raising a sensitive matter in the chief ministers para.        
	We would have put him behind bars but took recourse to the more sensible course of action, given the situation. We were also conscious of the fact that the one-man protest could have snowballed into a law and order problem, the officer said.        
	Bararis elder bother Indrajit, who retired as an additional commissioner of income tax last year, was all praise for him. Our mother was suffering, and he did what was required for her at that stage, he said.

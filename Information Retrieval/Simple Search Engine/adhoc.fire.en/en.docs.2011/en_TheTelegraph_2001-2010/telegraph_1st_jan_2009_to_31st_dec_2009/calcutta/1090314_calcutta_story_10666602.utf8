The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mom-in-law murders, walks to cops
                                                                                                               Mom-in-law murders, walks to cops
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A middle-aged woman in a blood-soaked sari walked two kilometres to a police station on Friday to confess that she had stabbed her daughter-in-law several times.        
	My daughter-in-lawGod, what have I done to her? Please do something, Snehalata Malik, 52, screamed after entering New Town police station around 12.30pm.        
	When a police team entered the third-floor apartment at Balaka Abasan in Action Area I of New Town around 15 minutes later, 22-year-old Deepanjali lay bleeding face down on the floor near the kitchen door. A blood-stained knife and a boti were found beside her.        
	She was breathing till then. We took her to Bidhannagar Subdivisional Hospital, where she was declared brought dead, said the duty officer at New Town police station.        
	Deepanjali was the wife of 28-year-old Deepak Malik, an employee of an infotech major in Sector V.        
	A preliminary investigation revealed that she and her mother-in-law had started arguing over something after Deepak left for office around 10am.        
	Snehalata apparently picked up the kitchen knife in a fit of rage and attacked her daughter-in-law, who retaliated with the boti.        
	Going by what Snehalata told us, we assume that she overpowered Deepanjali and stabbed her at least eight times, an investigator said.        
	The police found deep wounds on the nape of Deepanjalis neck, her stomach, arms and thighs. Snehalata had a few cut marks on her arms.        
	We have arrested Snehalata. We will reconstruct the sequence of events once she comes out of shock and is able to speak coherently, said Supratim Sarkar, the superintendent of police of North 24-Parganas.        
	Deepak, who came to know about the incident from the police, said his wife and mother would often squabble but things never turned violent. I am shattered. I have lost them both, he cried.        
	The youth from Rourkela had a love marriage with Deepanjali a year ago but his parents didnt approve of his choice.        
	Deepak said Snehalata came to stay with him and Deepanjali just over a month ago. How could I have known that things would come to such a pass? he mumbled.        
	Deepaks father is in Rourkela and has been informed about the family tragedy.        
	Neighbours at Balaka Abasan said they knew nothing about the Malik family.        
	The secretary of the co-operative society, Sanjib Chakrabarty, said it was only after the incident occurred that he came to know that Deepak was a tenant in the housing complex. The two-room flat belongs to a defence services employee who was transferred to New Delhi sometime back. We had no clue he had rented it out to someone.        
	The guard at the main gate said he had seen Snehalata walk out with blood on her clothes and asked her whether something was wrong, but she didnt reply. She seemed to be in a trance.        
	Investigators are trying to find out whether anybody else had seen Snehalata walking towards the police station in a blood-soaked sari.

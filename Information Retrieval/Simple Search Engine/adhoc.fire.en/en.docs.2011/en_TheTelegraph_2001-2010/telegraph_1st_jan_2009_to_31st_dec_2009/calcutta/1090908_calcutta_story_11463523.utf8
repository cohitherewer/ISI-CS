	A newborn baby was found in a septic tank in Sonarpur, on the southern fringes of the city, on Sunday. The baby boy was rescued by residents and admitted to a hospital in the neighbourhood.         
	Police are trying to trace the parents of the baby even as some couples are queuing up to adopt him.        
	Around 6.30am on Sunday, I heard a baby crying feebly and rushed to the septic tank of our neighbour, the Sarkars, said Bulu Barkandaz, a resident of Peara Bagan, on Monday.         
	Bulus son Gopal and members of the Sarkar family removed the asbestos cover of the tank and brought out a bucket with the help of a bamboo stick.        
	The child was placed inside the bucket, wrapped in cloth. His face was covered with filth. I cleaned him up and took him to the hospital, said Bulu. On Monday, the residents informed Sonarpur police station about the baby.        
	The block medical officer (health) of Sonarpur, Somnath Mukherjee, who is looking after the child, said: The boy has some minor bruises but he is in sound condition. We will hand him over to the social welfare department, he said.         
	Mukherjee said this was the third abandoned child to be found in the area this year. Two newborn girls had been found earlier and handed over to the social welfare department.        
	A number of couples are keen on adopting the boy found yesterday, said an officer.        
	The additional superintendent of police (rural), Nishat Pervez, said: We are trying to trace the babys parents by scanning the records of hospitals in the area.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Apex court claim by bus lobby
                                                                                                               Apex court claim by bus lobby
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The Bengal Bus Syndicate told the high court on Tuesday that they had moved a special leave petition in the Supreme Court against the order on phase-out of old commercial vehicles from August 1.        
	However, Syndicate vice-president Rabi Saha told Metro from Delhi on Tuesday evening that they would try to file the petition on Wednesday.         
	Syndicate lawyers were contesting an appeal by the state against an order stating that buses could not be phased out on the basis of their age. The bench on Tuesday adjourned the hearing for a week as the case was pending before the apex court.        
	Another high court bench on Tuesday refused to hear a plea by the owners of three commercial vehicles in Hooghly challenging the July 17, 2008, phase-out order since the matter was pending before a division bench headed by the chief justice of the court.

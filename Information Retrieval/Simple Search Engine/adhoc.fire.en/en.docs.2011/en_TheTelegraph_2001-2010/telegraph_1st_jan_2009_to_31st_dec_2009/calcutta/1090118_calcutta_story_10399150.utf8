The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | House of dolls
                                                                                                               House of dolls
                                      Dolls at the exhibition and (below) artist Peter Bjorn Franceschi. Pictures by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                    
	They look like toys made by children, beautifully strung up and suspended from the ceiling in an installation at various heights. Some of them have legs that are shrunk, or hands not fully formed. Some are slightly touched with nightmare.         
	One of them, a big, white doll with a huge head, whose legs are planted on the ground, looks ready to walk off.         
	They look like body parts or misshapen bodies. They are, in a way, vital parts of the people who made them. Parts of their life that they have been cut off from.         
	Twenty-six inmates of mental hospitals in the city were asked to think of something  a happy or unhappy memory  and make dolls about it.         
	The exhibition was organised by the NGO Anjali, which works with mental health patients, from January 10 to January 15 at Weavers Studio. The participants were from the Lumbini Park and Pavlov hospitals. They worked for a month with Peter Bjorn Franceschi, an artist from Denmark, from their hospital beds and produced the dolls.         
	The result was extraordinary. It looks like their surrogate family.         
	The participants, hardly visited by their family, mostly made dolls of their loved ones. The reasons were various.         
	How would they feel going over the bodies, so to say, of a daughter, a son, a husband, making them, going over them part by part, touching them, knowing perhaps this is the closest they would ever come to them?         
	Sandhya says she has made a doll thinking of her son, when he was just born and her husband had bought a pillow and a mosquito net. Its a tiny doll, black, kind of bruised with yellow, red and green paint.         
	I have made this doll thinking of her, says Preeti of her daughter. I loved this soft feeling while making the doll. Soft hands, red dress, green ribbon, altogether it made me feel so good.         
	Rupa worked from a more complex motive. She made a white doll with a large head and four squiggly, tentacle-like legs. It could be of Lord Krishna and/or her sir, whom she loved.         
	Says Ranu of her orange, sequinned Bhola fish: I had not wanted to make a fish, but this gradually became a fish. My father used to bring Bhola fish whenever I wanted. I remember my parents whenever I touch this Bhola fish.         
	There is a strong sense of entitlement.         
	Says Jeet: I have made this doll thinking of (my niece) Bhelu. She looks like a doll and also loves dolls. I miss my mother, didi (sister) and Bhelu very much. Even if Bhelu wants, I will not gift this doll to her.         
	Says Ashok, who has made a white doll: One side of the doll is my son and one is my daughter.         
	When normal individuals think this way, they are probably called deep thinkers.                     CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hope for library in next poll
                                                                                                               Hope for library in next poll
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The secretary of the Union culture ministry, Jawhar Sircar, has said that after these elections, a hunt will be on to find a suitable public building within one or two miles of National Library for the Election Commission to use next time.        
	Sircar appeared to be juggling two hats  that of a former chief electoral officer of Bengal and now the secretary of the Union culture ministry under which the library falls  when he told Metro over phone on Wednesday that the commissions decision to take over the library premises was a half-way compromise.        
	The commission has acquired the premises to ensure a necessary democratic process but full precaution is being taken to ensure that there is little disturbance for the readers, he stressed.        
	Sircar said he was aware of the outrage in Calcutta over the library invasion but the commission had taken the decision reluctantly because there was no other way.        
	On a personal note, Sircar said, the situation was charged with irony. As chief electoral officer he had presided over the library grounds being taken over during an election. At the same time, Sircar is a committed library-goer. I am a product of National Library, he said.        
	For many more like him, Sircar will embark on a hunt for an alternative Alipore address, something Metro had done on April 23 under the guidance of academic Sukanta Chaudhuri.

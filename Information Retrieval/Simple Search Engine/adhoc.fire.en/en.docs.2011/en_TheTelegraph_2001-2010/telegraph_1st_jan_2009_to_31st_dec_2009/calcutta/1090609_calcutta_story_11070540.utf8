The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Helping hand for cancer-hit family
                                                                                                               Helping hand for cancer-hit family
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Sandip Sharma with his parents at their north Calcutta shelter. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Sandip Sharma, the Liluah boy who had to quit school after his parents were diagnosed with cancer within 10 months of each other, can now afford a smile with Calcuttans queuing up to help the family after their story was published in Metro (Cancer double blow for boys family, May 22).         
	The 12-year-olds father Ramakant, 40, was diagnosed with throat cancer last May. Sandips mother Sunita Devi, 35, was diagnosed with cancer of the oesophagus in March. Sandip, who himself suffers from a chronic vision problem and needs frequent eye check-ups, had to drop out after Ramakant was forced to quit his job in a sari shop.        
	The treatment of all three had to be discontinued because of lack of funds. The family even had to vacate their rented flat and move in with a friend of Ramakant in north Calcutta.         
	We had lots of visitors and received innumerable calls in the first couple of days after the report appeared. Many of those who offered help were not rich but insisted that we continue Sandips schooling and eye check-ups at all cost. Then Manoj Kumar Jain, on behalf of the Jain Group of Industries, pledged to foot all our medical bills, said Ramakant.        
	Individuals also offered to sponsor one or two chemotherapy sessions for Sunita. We are grateful and will contact them if needed, she said.         
	Ramakant was admitted to a nursing home for tests last week, after an interruption in treatment stretching months. ENT surgeon Tushar Kanti Ghosh, who performed a micro-laryngoscopy on him, said the cancer had spread from his pharynx to the upper part of his larynx.        
	Ramakant had gone into complete clinical remission but had to discontinue medication as he wanted to carry on his wifes treatment. Thus there has been a recurrence, he added.        
	Ramakant cannot be operated upon now and will have to undergo chemotherapy like his wife.        
	The Jains wanted to admit Sandip to a boarding school but the Class VI student wanted to continue his education in a regular school. My fathers treatment has started and my mother is due for another chemotherapy on June 13. I need to stay with them and look after them, he told Metro.        
	Things are looking up at the moment with our chemotherapy and Sandips education being funded but the daily expenses are still a worry. We are still to pay two months rent. Also, the medicines are very expensive, said Sunita.

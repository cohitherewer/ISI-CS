The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Deja vu of deadline amp; duck
                                                                                                              Deja vu of deadline amp; duck
										      JAYANTA BASU      TT FOR CITY - POISON AIR                                          
	It is unfortunate that the state government is not in a position to carry out the court orders in time. We still doubt whether the order will be carried out at all. But still we are providing them time.  Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar on Tuesday        
	If the chief justice is in doubt over the government carrying out the courts order regarding auto pollution, petitioner Subhash Dutta is in no doubt whatsoever.        
	I am convinced that the government will not be in a position to carry out the court orders by July 31, said the green activist, a day after advocate-general Balai Ray cited elections as the latest pushback excuse.        
	Only the governments excuse changes, otherwise everything is like an action replay, said Dutta.         
	Tuesday the 17th was deja vu for Subhash Dutta in court.        
	Yet again, he saw the government expressing its inability to meet a deadline to clean Calcuttas air.        
	Yet again, he heard the bench berate the government and then give it one more deadline.        
	Yet again, he shook his bald pate in frustration for a brief moment, allowed himself a wry smile, gathered his pollution papers and then strode out to fight another day.        
	Duttas present crusade for clean air in Calcutta dates back to March 2007, when  on the high courts suggestion  he had filed a petition for directives and deadlines to be set for the phaseout of old and polluting vehicles that were jeopardising the health of the city, particularly its children.        
	Now that the elections have been declared and campaigns by political parties have started, the police are busy with the election process. So, they cant run after two-stroke autos and seize them. Similar is the case with phasing out old vehicles. This can only be done after the elections are over.  advocate-general Balai Ray in court on Tuesday        
	What was stopping the police from acting against illegal autos, polluting autos and old vehicles between July 18, 2008 (when the high court first set the deadline), and March 2, 2009 (when the Lok Sabha election dates were announced)? demanded Dutta.        
	The high court had on July 18, 2008, set a December 31, 2008, deadline for polluting autos and an end-March 2009 deadline for transport and commercial vehicles more than 15 years old.        
	By their own submission in court on Tuesday, in the past eight months, only 1,066 autos could be converted to clean fuel, out of around 70,000 polluting three-wheelers. Less than 50 illegal autos have been seized, though at least 30,000 such autos ply in the city, pointed out the petitioner.        
	In the case of 15-year-old vehicles, nothing concrete has been done apart from holding some stray meetings. There has been no move to check auto emission test centres and identify rogue ones. A negligible amount of katatel (spurious fuel on which most two-stroke autos run) has been seized. What election was the police force busy with all this while? wondered Dutta.        
	If Delhi, Bangalore and other cities can phase out the old vehicles, why cant Bengal?  the two-judge bench of Chief Justice Nijjar and Justice Pinaki Chandra Ghosh on Tuesday        
	The answer lies in the governments deliberate  and diabolical  act of slowing down the drive against air pollution. Just see the governments track record regarding air pollution. It is nothing but a series of failures to meet court directives and deadlines, said Dutta.        
	The government has scant regard for the health and well-being of the people of Calcutta, especially the children. It has no intention of doing anything about the pollution problem. It will keep pushing back deadlines on some pretext or the other. If required it will trigger pandemonium closer to the next deadline so that the court is forced to give more time on law-and-order grounds, he predicted.        
	So what will the lone crusader do now? Pray for a predominantly non-government monitoring committee to be appointed by the court in yet another attempt to get the government to toe the line.        
	The present monitoring committee chaired by the chief secretary has done precious little.

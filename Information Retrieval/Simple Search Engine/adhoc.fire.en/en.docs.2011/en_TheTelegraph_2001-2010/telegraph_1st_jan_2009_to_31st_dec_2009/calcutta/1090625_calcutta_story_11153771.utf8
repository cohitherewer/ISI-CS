The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hitch in rain hope 
                                                                                                               Hitch in rain hope 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The monsoon in Bengal has run into rough weather over the Arabian Sea, denying the sweltering city rain relief.        
	The depression that the weatherman had warned of on Tuesday strengthened on Wednesday, rejuvenating rain clouds in western India but halting the revival of monsoon flow in Bengal.         
	A fresh revival could take at least another two to three days. Relief might come only in the form of isolated thunderstorms in south Bengal, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.         
	Wednesday was hot and humid, with parts of the city having to make do with traces of rain towards afternoon.        
	The maximum temperature was 36 degree Celsius, two points above normal, while humidity ranged between 58 per cent and 90 per cent. The discomfort index touched 65 degree Celsius, 10 points above normal.        
	Rain prophesies on Ratha Yatra were proved wrong. According to mythological texts, the chariot ride gets divine sanctity with a light shower. It will surely rain, said Santanu Kumar Das, the president of Biswa Janani Kala Parishad of Ganjam district in Orissa, during a Ratha Yatra function in Salt Lake. But a few drops is all that the chariots in the city got.        
	Thursday is likely to be partly cloudy with the possibility of thunderclouds developing towards the afternoon or evening, the weatherman said.         
	Bengals weak monsoon is tormenting Delhi too. The Prime Ministers Office has instructed the cabinet secretary to keep it informed about monsoon flow in Bengal. In meteorological terms, it is a key driver for monsoon across the country, an official in the PMO told Metro over phone.         
	The Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore has been sending data to Delhi several times during the day, though Debnath said he had received no specific instructions from the PMO.        
	The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) said there was no need to panic yet. Bengal is in one of the scanty-monsoon zones but abundant rain in July could make up for the deficit, said an official from Delhi.

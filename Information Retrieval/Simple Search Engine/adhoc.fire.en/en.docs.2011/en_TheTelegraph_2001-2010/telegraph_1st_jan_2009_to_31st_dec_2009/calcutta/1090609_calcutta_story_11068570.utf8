The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mind the flight fare gap
                                                                                                               Mind the flight fare gap

	Foreign airlines may be wooing fliers with discount deals but their fares arent always fair, says the countrys civil aviation watchdog.        
	The Directorate General of Civil Aviation has written to 14 international airlines, asking them to explain why they continue to burden passengers with their agents commission.        
	The IATA (International Air Transport Association)s Resolution 810 (I) states that airlines will remunerate their agents. We have asked the airlines why passengers have been asked to shoulder this burden, said a senior official of the directorate from New Delhi.        
	Most airlines, both domestic and foreign, had stopped paying the five per cent commission fee to travel agents last November. The Indian carriers rolled back the decision a few weeks later but foreign airlines have persisted with the zero-commission system, asking their agents to charge the passengers instead.         
	Agents now levy a transaction fee ranging between Rs 350 and Rs 2,500, depending on the routes and class. The difference in the price of tickets purchased through different agents often causes confusion, according to passengers.        
	City-based businessman Manish Sharma, who is a frequent flier to Europe and the US, said the difference in the price of a ticket ranged between five and 10 per cent. I book my tickets through three travel agents. Last month I was scheduled to take a Lufthansa flight to the US and all three quoted different prices.        
	A passenger can avoid paying the commission by booking online through an airlines website, but he or she would need an agents services for multiple routes involving more than one carrier.        
	Two of the 14 airlines to which the DGCA has written  Singapore Airlines and Lufthansa  operate from Calcutta. The other airlines include British Airways, Japan Airlines and American Airlines, DGCA officials said.         
	The letter was issued after the DGCA convened a meeting of tour operators associations in Delhi.         
	We will reply to the letter soon, explaining our stand to the DGCA, said a Singapore Airlines spokesperson. To avoid confusion over fares, we request passengers to buy tickets online or from our booking counters, she added.        
	A Lufthansa official said the airline was yet to receive the letter. We will take appropriate steps after studying it.        
	Anil Punjabi, the chairman (east) of the Travel Agents Federation of India, welcomed the DGCAs intervention. This letter is a ray of hope for the travel industry. Passengers are being priced differently for the same ticket and the airlines are responsible for this. We hope the problem will be resolved for good, he said.

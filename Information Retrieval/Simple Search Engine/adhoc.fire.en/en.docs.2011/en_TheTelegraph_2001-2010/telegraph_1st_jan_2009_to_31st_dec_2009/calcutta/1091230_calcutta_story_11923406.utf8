The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Shocker for party shopper
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Shocker for party shopper
  - Prices hit host where it hurts         MEGHDEEP BHATTACHARYYA                                                  
	A sharp rise in food prices has dampened the spirit of year-end festivities and forced party planners to keep things simple.        
	Metro accompanied Tulika Mukherjee, a 33-year-old investment consultant, as she went shopping for kitchen supplies to host a small party at home on New Years Eve. The menu? Kadaishutir kochuri, aloo dum, pulao, fried chicken, prawn curry, fruit salad and orange pudding.        
	Tulika, the wife of a marine officer and mother of a nine-year-old boy, spent around 50 minutes at the Gariahat market. By the end of it, the occasional (and reluctant) shopper was in shock. Heres why...              
	Buying vegetables: First stop, the sabji stall of Bashir Haq. As Bashir rattled off the rates, Tulika raised her brows. Eto daam? she asked.        
	Daam toh ei rokomi jachhey (This is what the prices have been), said Bashir, leaving her no room to bargain.        
	Finance ministry data shows that vegetables have become costlier by 37.97 per cent in a year. Some economists fear that things will worsen under the impact of the weakest monsoon in 37 years.        
	Tulika didnt have the time (or inclination) to talk macroeconomics with Bashir. She picked up what she had to, paid Rs 347.50 and moved on. The same basket would have cost her Rs 196.25 last December.        
	Buying grocery: Tulika was bracing for the bad news, but the prices of moong daal, garlic, cooking oil and sugar still managed to stump her.        
	Government data shows that on a year-on-year basis, pulses got dearer by 115.04 per cent while potato prices went up by 41.61 per cent. Food inflation, which measures the rate of change in food prices, stands at a decades high of 18.65 per cent (as of December 12), driven by costlier vegetables, pulses, rice and fruits.        
	Tulika paid Rs 560.50 for her purchases. The same grocery buy would have cost her Rs 325.50 last December.        
	Buying fish, meat and eggs:        
	In less than half an hour, Tulika had learnt how prices are playing party pooper this festive season.        
	Not wasting time on bargaining, she rushed through her purchase of prawn, bekti fillets, meat and eggs. Her payout? Rs 2,024. The pocket pinch 12 months ago would have been Rs 1,688. It really pinches, said Tulika.        
	Buying fruits: Last stop, fruit stall. The bill for the key ingredients of Tulikas special fruit salad and orange pudding came to Rs 184. The same thing last year would have totalled Rs 137, with the fruit basket dearer by 10.2 per cent.        
	At this rate, I would have been better off taking my guests out for dinner on New Years Eve, shrugged Tulika.              
	Till Pranab Mukherjee finds an effective tool to manage prices, consumers like Tulika Mukherjee will continue to reel under the burden of spiralling food prices.

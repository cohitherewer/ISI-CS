  - Govt directive to schools on fighting disease          A STAFF REPORTER                                                  
	Eight persons tested positive for swine flu on Friday even as the state government directed all schools to let students and staff-members showing symptoms of the disease to stay at home for seven to 10 days.        
	The number of swine flu patients in the city went up to 14 over the past two days following the detection of the H1N1 virus in the blood samples of eight persons on Friday. Of the latest victims, four are being treated at MR Bangur Hospital and Infectious Diseases Hospital each.        
	Twenty-eight people have so far tested positive for swine flu in the city.        
	The government directive, to be followed with immediate effect, states: Any student or staff member showing flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat, running nose and difficulty in breathing should be allowed to stay at home for a period of 7 to 10 days. The schools have been asked not to ask for medical certificates when the ailing students and staff members are back.        
	Educational institutions will have to monitor the health of students and staffers, especially those who have come in contact with swine flu patients, and identify those who are showing symptoms of the disease.        
	The authorities of students hostels will have to ensure that the employees wash hands regularly and wear face masks.         
	All schools have been asked to report swine flu cases to the local health officer. The government has also asked schools not to organise excursions to flu-affected countries.        
	All state-aided and private schools will have to follow the directive, said school education director Dibyen Mukherjee.        
	The swine flu clinics at Infectious Diseases, RG Kar and NRS hospitals will remain open on Independence Day, said Tapas Sen, the states nodal officer for swine flu.

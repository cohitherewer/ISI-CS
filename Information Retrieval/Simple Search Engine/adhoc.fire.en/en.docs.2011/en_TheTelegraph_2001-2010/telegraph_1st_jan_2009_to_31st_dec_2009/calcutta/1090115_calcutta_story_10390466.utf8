The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rights panel in limbo
                                                                                                               Rights panel in limbo
          OUR BUREAU                              
	The state human rights commission was reduced to a non-entity on Wednesday following the retirement of one of its three members.        
	The Human Rights Commission Act stipulates that a panel cannot function with less than three members, including the chairperson.        
	N.A. Khan, one of the members, retired on Wednesday, while the tenure of the chairman, Justice (retd) Shyamal Kumar Sen, ended on December 31.        
	The two members still on the panel are Sourin Roy and Justice Narayan Sil.        
	The commission ceased to function after Khans retirement, said an official in the state judicial department. The state government is yet to find a replacement for Justice (retd) Sen. According to the act, the chairman has to be a former chief justice of a high court.        
	After Justice (retd) Sens retirement, Justice (retd) Sil was asked to look after the chairmans responsibilities.        
	Officials said the commission could not probe any case of human rights violation unless the deadlock was resolved. Last year, the panel had received 898 complaints.        
	Sources said the government had considered the names of A.N. Roy, a former chief justice of Sikkim High Court, and S. Roy Burman, an ex-chief justice of Orissa High Court, for the chairmans post.        
	But Justice (retd) Roy has already been appointed chairman of the Sikkim human rights commission and Justice (retd) Roy Burman has taken over the reins of the rights panel in Assam. We are now looking for a third candidate, said an official.        
	One possibility, sources said, was to appoint Justice S.B. Sinha, a former chief justice of Allahabad High Court and a serving judge in the apex court.        
	He will retire in September. Will the commission sit idle till then? wondered an official.

	Students from four city schools can now look forward to visiting Germany, as part of a cultural exchange programme initiated by the German foreign office and implemented by Max Mueller Bhavan, the German Academic Exchange Service and Central Office for Schools Abroad.         
	Called Schools: Partners of the Future (PASCH), the programme inducted Don Bosco School, Park Circus, Birla High School for Boys, Modern High School for Girls and The Heritage School with the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on Friday with Max Mueller Bhavan.        
	As part of the programme, we are creating a network of at least 1,000 partner schools from around the world to create awareness about Germany. Forty Indian schools have been inducted so far, said Reimer Volker, the director of Max Mueller Bhavan.         
	Don Bosco and The Heritage have introduced German as a hobby language from this year for classes VI, VII and VIII.         
	The programme has been running since last year, when five students won scholarships to visit Schlachtensee, near Berlin, for a three-week language and activity camp. This year, 12 students, three from each partner school, will head for a village called Kirchheimbolanden, near Frankfurt, in June, said Amrita Dhara, head of the language department at Max Mueller.         
	The students are now taking first-level language classes at Max Mueller Bhavan as preparation for the camp. Nine others will head for a 10-day environment awareness camp in Yercaud, Tamil Nadu, in June.         
	The programme will also train teachers to teach the German language in their schools as part of a three-year programme.         
	The partner schools will nominate three teachers, each whom will be taught the German language, followed by training in German teaching methods, added Dhara.         
	Last year, two principals from city schools were part of an Indian delegation of teachers taken on a 10-day tour of educational institutions, including schools, universities and research institutes.        
	Mukta Nain, principal of Birla High School for Boys, was a member of the delegation: Some of their techniques can be useful if implemented in our country, she said.         
	Dhara finds the students response encouraging. Said Amatasree Basu, a Class XII student of Modern High School, who attended the camp last year: We interacted with students from all over the world and learnt a lot while working on the projects together. My friend even taught them Bollywood dance steps.

	The department of commerce and home science of JD Birla Institute organised a workshop on substance abuse on April 17.         
	The speakers included members of NGO Kripa Foundation. The session started with a documentary titled One Way Ticket, highlighting the ill-effects of drugs, alcohol addiction and other forms of substance abuse. This was followed by a presentation on drug addiction. It projected that addiction starts with use, misuse and culminates in abuse. At the interactive session that followed, we got an insight on the reasons for addiction. The workshop ended with a poster competition.

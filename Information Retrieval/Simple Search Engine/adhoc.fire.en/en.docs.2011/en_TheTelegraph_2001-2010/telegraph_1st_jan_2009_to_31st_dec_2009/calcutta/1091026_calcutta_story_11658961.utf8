The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Commuter at crisis crossroads 
                                                                                                               Commuter at crisis crossroads
   Old makes way but not for new
          KINSUK BASU                                                   
	The foul-fume fleet may be finally off the road but the citys transport woes are far from over with the government failing to fill the void.        
	Buses older than 15 years have been withdrawn from 165-odd routes since July 31 but most of these are yet to be replaced, reducing the transport options of commuters by more than half in some areas.        
	Only seven replaced buses are out on the road so far, against 355 replacement orders. We know thats a very poor record, admitted a senior official of the transport department a week before the government is due to submit a status report in the high court.         
	Facing flak from commuters and the transport lobby, the government did order 70 low-floor buses under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission but there are apparently few takers for these vehicles.        
	Around 40 of these buses have been rolled out so far. The surface transport department is running some of them but private operators are unwilling to be franchisees, said a source at Writers Buildings.        
	Sadhan Das, the general secretary of the Joint Council of Bus Syndicates, argued that it did not make sense to deploy these buses on low-yield routes        
	 The EMI for a low-floor bus works out to around Rs 22,600 for a term of eight years. That is big money, and not many operators are willing to risk low returns, he explained.         
	But why arent owners of phased-out buses buying new vehicles under the governments replacement scheme?        
	Not a single bus owner who has agreed to replace his old vehicle has yet received the promised government grant of Rs 50,000, said Das.        
	The transport department recently issued a fresh invitation to private operators to ply new vehicles on 112 routes, including 70 for minibuses.        
	On Thursday, transport minister Ranjit Kundu asked his officers to ensure that state buses plied on some long-distance routes even if it meant incurring losses. Commuters are suffering. Route No. 47 (Lake Town-Kalindi) had as many as 52 buses that were 15 years and older. So once the old vehicles were withdrawn, there were no buses to be seen on that route, said a senior official of the surface transport corporation.         
	Routes like 30A, 211 and 223 have been facing the same problem.If private bus operators dont roll out new buses, it will be impossible for the government to fill the gaps, the official said.         
	The state transport corporations shoulder only 15-20 per cent of the commuter load.         
	The crisis could get worse during the monsoon because the governments fleet of low-floor-buses wont be able to ply on water-logged streets.        
	Unlike Delhi or Chennai, roads in Calcutta are not built for new-generation buses. Besides, the deal is that low-floor buses financed under the urban renewal mission will ply only within city limits, said an officer of the traffic infrastructure development corporation.         
	A green activist involved in the campaign against polluting vehicles blamed the governments inefficiency for the city getting cleaner air at the cost of a convenient commute.        
	 The governments initiative to replace old buses with new has been as slipshod as its efforts to enforce the courts deadline for the phaseout of commercial vehicles older than 15 years, he added.

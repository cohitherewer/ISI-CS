	Gaekwad, the brother-in-law of theft accused Raj Saikia, was produced in an Alipore court on Sunday and remanded in police custody till October 1.        
	A probe revealed that he had entered the zoo on the night of August 8 to steal the marmosets, said a senior officer of the detective department.        
	 Gaekwad was part of an international gang that smuggled rare and endangered animals. His arrest will help us bust the racket, added the official.

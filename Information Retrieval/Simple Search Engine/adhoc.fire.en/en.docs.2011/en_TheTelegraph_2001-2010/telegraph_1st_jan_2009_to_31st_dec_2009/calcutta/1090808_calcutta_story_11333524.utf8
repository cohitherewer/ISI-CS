The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Court asks for BPL list
                                                                                                               Court asks for BPL list
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Friday directed the Calcutta Municipal Corporation to submit within 15 days a list of city residents living below poverty line (BPL).        
	A division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice B. Somadder passed the order on the basis of a petition by Griha Adhikar Raksha Mancha and seven other NGOs.        
	The organisations claimed the civic body had not published the list despite the high court asking it to do so in October last year.        
	The advocate representing the NGOs told the court that the municipal commissioner had issued a notification in February last year which stated that the BPL list would be put up either in borough offices or in schools run by the civic body.        
	The NGOs, which had submitted applications by 17,000 footpath dwellers for inclusion in the BPL list to the civic body, had moved court last September.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Scientific rigging of consent
                                                                                                               Scientific rigging of consent
  - Cadres armed with voter list and pre-dated permission forms 
  turn election office into war room for wall graffiti

	At first glance, its just another 600 square feet room on the first floor of a two-storey building in the Rashbehari area.        
	A closer look reveals a wall war room with plastic chairs (all red), a wooden table, a steel almirah, some CPM flags and two containers of paint in a corner. The almirah contains hundreds of computer-generated consent forms and a copy of the voters list.        
	When the graffiti gang is at work, Cadre One sits with a voters list and Cadre Two sits with a sheaf of consent forms. Cadre One reads out the names of the landlord/tenant of a given address.        
	Cadre Two puts down the names at the bottom of consent note  pre-dated to before the wall graffiti came up at a given address.                
	Cadre Two then passes it on to Cadre Three to arrange for a pile of consent notes to be despatched to the local police station (see illustration).        
	Welcome to scientific rigging 2009.        
	Not during the elections at polling booths to grab votes but weeks before the elections at a para address to grab walls.        
	Operation Consent  creation of consent letters with pre-dated permission to beat the system and dodge prosecution for violation of the Election Commissions model code of conduct  is underway on a war footing.        
	What the political parties are exploiting is a loophole in the Election Commission graffiti rule that allows a violator to get away scot-free if the consent form is furnished within 72 hours of receiving a showcause notice from the returning officer.        
	Given the getaway option, the parties are not even bothering to arm-twist house owners and squeeze out a consent. All they are doing is manufacturing pre-dated permission forms to show that it was obtained three days before the paint job, as mandated.        
	We go through the voters list, fill in the names of residents or landlords of a building in the consent letters, and put in a safe date, explains a party cadre in charge of graffiti writing on Pratapaditya Road in Tollygunge.        
	He is seated in a makeshift CPM election office on the first floor of 32 Pratapaditya Road. We set up the office about 10 days ago. We hold meetings twice a day to chalk out strategy, but the rest of the day we churn out consent notes, adds the man in his 40s, pointing to the almirah that contains copies of the voters list and consent forms.        
	The forms  apparently collected from the Calcutta district committee office on AJC Bose Road  are in Bengali and English, used after studying the areas demographic profile. If an area has more non-Bengali residents then we use letters printed in English. Its all done to make the process foolproof, says a cadre.        
	The consent letter is then sent to the local police station, in this case Tollygunge. But we are careful not to submit too many letters at one go even if we have them ready, to avoid suspicion, reveals the cadre.        
	Local police stations are meant to forward the consent letters to their respective returning officers. Its not possible for us to verify each consent note but most of them are bogus. Its obvious even at first glance, with many of them bearing the same handwriting, said an officer of Tollygunge police station.        
	Residents of 68/4 Pratapaditya Road thought they were lucky when cops came calling asking whether the graffiti was written on their walls with their permission. But on March 19, CPM cadres submitted a fake consent letter at Tollygunge police station on behalf of the four tenants, after The Telegraph highlighted the violation.        
	We were surprised to know that a consent letter with our names on it was submitted at the police station on March 19 without our knowledge. It just shows how blas the party activists are. The returning officers should verify these consent letters and not accept them blindly, said one of the residents.        
	The returning officers are receiving a flood of pre-dated permission forms, almost all of them after a show-cause notice has been served on wall graffiti violators. A few are trickling in to pre-empt the notice after a paint job is done.        
	The numbers vary from constituency to constituency, but there have been phases in the past few days when we have received 20-30 consent notes every hour between 11am and 2pm. The total number of such notes received in a day has ranged between 80 and 150, says an Election Commission official.        
	A returning officers reason for suspicion of a consent note being forged must be sustainable and recordable. The case is considered closed in the absence of such a suspicion or a counter complaint.        
	If there is a counter complaint  this time by a resident who can no longer remain anonymous  the returning officer can send a police officer for further investigation. If the note turns out to be fake, the police can file a case of forgery for purpose of cheating under Section 468 of the IPC, which is punishable by imprisonment of up to seven years and fine, said a returning officer.        
	The last word from Prasad Guha, a vital cog in the CPMs publicity wheel in Calcutta South? We are doing everything by the rulebook.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Power cuts clog traffic
                                                                                                               Power cuts clog traffic

	Calcutta relived the Aila aftermath on Thursday, with power cuts for up to five hours at a stretch and traffic chaos triggered by citizens blocking roads over the blackout.        
	The city knew power cuts were coming after CESC had to shut down one of its mainstays on Wednesday evening to repair a snag, causing a shortfall of over 200MW. But the duration of the loadshedding sent temperatures soaring.        
	As the lights went out from Alipore to Lake Town, citizens in parts of north Calcutta poured into the streets in a rerun of the protests that had stalled the city post-Aila. Protesters put up roadblocks at the intersection of Vivekananda Road and Raja Dinendra Street, Canal East Road, Bagmari and the Maniktala crossing late in the evening.        
	With police forced to divert east-bound vehicles from Girish Park, west-bound traffic from Kankurgachhi and vehicles headed south from the Khanna crossing, all connecting roads were also choked.        
	We are trying our best to get the Budge Budge unit up and running by Friday evening, a CESC official said.        
	But power department officials said it was very difficult to repair a boiler tube leak within two days.        
	CESC procured 150MW of power from Chhattisgarh and another 400MW from the state board but the limitations of the transmission network prevented it from drawing more than 600MW from other grids.        
	That triggered a blame game. We have been asking CESC to revamp its transmission network for some time for such an emergency, said power secretary Sunil Mitra.         
	Areas served by the state-run electricity board escaped without power cuts.        
	There was no power at home from 1pm to 3pm. The power went again at 4.30pm and did not return until 9.15pm, complained Uma Debnath of Alipore.        
	Sitarist Purbayan Chatterjee, who stays in Rajarhat, said he lost three hours of work because of the power cuts. We have been suffering from Wednesday night. Some families in our complex slept in their cars with the AC on.        
	Emergency services were also affected, with some police stations being forced to work by candlelight.

                                                                                                               Riz cop verdict pushed back
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta High Court on Friday adjourned its judgment on a plea that the state government was bound to allow the CBI to prosecute three police officers on the charge of abetting Rizwanur Rahmans suicide.        
	The petition was filed by Rizwanurs elder brother Rukbanur. The hearing was completed on Friday.        
	The CBI had filed chargesheets against the officers  former deputy commissioner (detective department) Ajoy Kumar, former assistant commissioner Sukanti Chakraborty and sub-inspector Krishnendu Das  in a subordinate court. The three were charged under IPC sections 120B (conspiracy), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 306 (abetment to suicide).        
	When asked for permission, the state government had allowed the investigative agency to proceed only with the criminal intimidation and conspiracy charges.         
	Rukbanur then filed a petition in the high court saying the government was bound to allow the CBI to prosecute the accused officers under Section 306 of the IPC.        
	On Friday, Rukbanurs counsel Kalyan Banerjee submitted before Justice Nadira Patherya: It is not mandatory for the CBI to obtain the state governments consent before prosecuting police officers in a criminal case. If the CBI asks for permission, the state government must grant it.        
	The lawyer alleged that the state had been trying to shield the officers. CBI counsel Ranjan Roy supported Banerjee.        
	Advocate-general Balai Ray said: It is the state governments discretion to grant or withhold permission to prosecute police officers.        
	A bench on Friday dismissed a petition by an NGO seeking an order to the CBI to stop its probe into the Rizwanur case as one of its officers, Partha Sarathi Bose, has been charged in a criminal case.

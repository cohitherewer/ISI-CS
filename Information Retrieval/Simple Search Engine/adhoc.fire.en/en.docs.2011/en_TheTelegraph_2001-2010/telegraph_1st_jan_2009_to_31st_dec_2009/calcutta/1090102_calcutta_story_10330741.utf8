The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Dance in club but dine in dhaba
                                                                                                               Dance in club but dine in dhaba
  - 79-year-old Balwant Singhs Eating House lures New Years Eve party crowd with paratha and paneer          ZEESHAN JAWED                          At any given point of time between midnight and 3.30am, there were 500-odd people at the vegetarian-only Harish Mukherjee Road dhaba. Picture by Pradip Sanyal                                        
	When: New Years Eve. What: Hungry hundreds. Where: Tolly or CC amp;FC? No, Balwant Singhs Eating House!        
	The crown for the curious footfall on 31st Nite goes to the dhaba on Harish Mukherjee Road, next to the gurdwara. There were more revellers in any of the major social clubs at the midnight moment but the footfall flow at Balwant Singhs between midnight and 3.30am was hard to match.        
	At any point of time in the first few hours of the new year, a 500-strong sip-and-bite brigade could be seen in front of the popular eatery, many gorging on vegetarian delicacies in their cars and some waiting for food parcels with a khullar of tea in hand. A serpentine queue of four-wheelers (from Santros to Innovas) and two-wheelers extended for 500 metres on either side of the 79-year-old food stop. Just like it did on Christmas Eve.        
	What makes the modest food stop  100 square feet premises seating only 35 but luring thousands  such a top draw for the festive crowd? The fact that this is an only-vegetarian dhaba where the food is simple yet finger-licking good. Balwants is excellent value for money and a great hangout for families and friends, said Sunil Agarwal, who partied in clubs on 24th and 31st but came to the dhaba for dinner.        
	The footfall is rising with every Christmas Eve and New Years Eve, smiled Manish Singh, the fourth generation of the family that started the dhaba way back in 1930. Our patrons drink and dance in clubs and then come and eat here, summed up Manish.        
	Like loyalist Veer Mahant, who keeps coming back to the dhaba as the food is tasty and the ambience homely. On 31st night, Veer was there with his gang, between partying at Saturday Club and Shisha.        
	For Jyoti Bajaj, seated in a Swift and relishing the Palak Cream and Lachhedar Paratha with husband Swarup and nine-year-old-son Harsh, it was a memorable debut at the dhaba. We usually eat at the club after partying. But some friends who had dined here on Xmas Eve were raving about the food so we decided to drive here from Calcutta Swimming Club.        
	There were 20 hands  double the usual figure  to serve the New Years Eve rush. We took all measures, including hiring extra serving hands and stocking up enough food, said Manish Singh, not risking a repeat of 24th night when the kitchen ran out of stock at 3am.        
	And what were the pop picks at Balwants  which claims to have fed KL Saigal, Satyajit Ray, Uttam Kumar and Kareena Kapoor  on the last night of 2008? Kaju Paneer, Vegetable Begum Bahar, Palak Cream, Navratan Korma, Lachhedar Paratha and tea.

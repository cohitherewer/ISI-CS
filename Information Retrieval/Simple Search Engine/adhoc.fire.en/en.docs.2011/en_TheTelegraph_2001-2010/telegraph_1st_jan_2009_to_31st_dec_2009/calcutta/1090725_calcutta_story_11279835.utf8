          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A senior official of a realty firm was arrested on Friday for allegedly submitting fake cash receipts of over Rs 2 crore to the civic body.        
	The Mumbai-based firm had purchased a property on Alipore Judges Court Road last year. The company handed over the amount to assistant general manager Ashok Bhattacharya for the mutation of the property.         
	According to police, Bhattacharya submitted three fake cash receipts at the civic headquarters while applying for mutation. The deputy assessee (south division) of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, Shantanu Samanta, lodged a complaint with the police after finding that the receipts were fake.        
	Bhattacharya was arrested in his Khardah house.

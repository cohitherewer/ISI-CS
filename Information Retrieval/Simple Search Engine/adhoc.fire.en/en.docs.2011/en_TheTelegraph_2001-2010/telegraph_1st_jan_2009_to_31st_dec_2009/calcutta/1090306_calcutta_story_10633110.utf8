                      Equation of power in sexual relationships                    A s squeamish as India is today about sex, this is also the land where queens once copulated with dead horses at religious ceremonies, where the art of love-making was declared the revelation of the gods and recorded in elaborate detail in the kama sutras and prostitution was a form of sacred offering at temples adorned with erotic sculptures. Using India as a paradigm, Rita Banerjis Sex and Power: Defining History, Shaping Societies illustrates that sexual morality is not an absolute but a facet of living that undergoes periodic upheavals. The author delineates four major periods in Indian history when there were significant shifts in the collective social perception of sex and sexuality, along with its associated customs and beliefs. According to her, the moral overview of any given period is determined not by a set of pre-existing ethics but by the existent power structure of the period in question. Interestingly, this accepted moral code actually serves the party in power. Playing out her theory in the context of contemporary India, Banerji concludes that the three most important issues facing the country today  population explosion, AIDS and female genocide  are the manifestations of a collective sexual malfunctioning of society, which needs to be redressed in the context of an existent social and economic power hierarchy. This evening, Penguin Books India and Crossword celebrate the publication of the book with a discussion on it by Dr Reimar Volker, director, Max Mueller Bhavan, Calcutta and Surendra Munshi, retd professor of sociology, IIM Calcutta.

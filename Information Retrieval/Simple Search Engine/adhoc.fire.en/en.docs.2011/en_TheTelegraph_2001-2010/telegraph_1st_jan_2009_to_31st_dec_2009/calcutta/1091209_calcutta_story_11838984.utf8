The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | C for confusion in CAT at a click
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      C for confusion in CAT at a click
          A STAFF REPORTER                           Examinees after appearing for CAT 2009                                  
	Complaints and doubts continued to dog CAT on the final day of its first online version.        
	The complaints ranged from disruptions caused by technical glitches to question papers of varying difficulty. Even those who did not face glitches complained that they were distracted by those who did.        
	I just want a fair shot at making it to an IIM. I should not lose out because there were problems in the system, said an examinee who took the test at the Heritage Institute of Technology. According to him, questions appeared on his screen slowly, affecting his performance.        
	About 175 of the 10,000-odd examinees from Calcutta were unable to take the test on the first two days. Many others faced glitches through the 11-day test window.        
	Aspiring managers are more worried about having to sit for CAT again than other entrance tests. Usually we take CAT and then shift focus to the other tests. But this time, we cant stop thinking about CAT. Some of us are waiting for the test to be cancelled while others only want another crack, said an examinee.        
	Adding to the confusion is testing service provider Prometrics statement that examinees whose performances were affected by glitches will be allowed to take the test again.        
	How are the IIMs going to take a call on what would be considered an impact of glitches? What happens to those who had to wait for a long time for questions to appear on screen but completed the test or those who were disturbed by others creating a ruckus about their problems? asked Naveen Saraff, the city head of coaching centre Career Launcher.        
	My computer did not hang but it took more than 15 minutes to download each question. I am going to write to Prometric to ask them if I can take the test again, said an examinee who appeared for the test on Monday.        
	Many felt the difficulty of the questions varied through the test window.        
	The tests on the first few days were easier than those towards the end. The difficulty levels of the mathematics and the reading-comprehension sections of the test varied greatly. How are they going to standardise the selection process? said Kaushik Kapoor of Erudite, another coaching centre.         
	The results of CAT 2009 will be announced on January 22, 2010.

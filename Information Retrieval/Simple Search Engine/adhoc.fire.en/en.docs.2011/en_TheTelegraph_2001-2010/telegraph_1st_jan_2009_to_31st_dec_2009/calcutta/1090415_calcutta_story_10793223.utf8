The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | School faces closure as funds dry up
                                                                                                               School faces closure as funds dry up
          JULIUS GOMES                          Fight for future: A still from Slumdog Millionaire which depicts the growing up struggles  and occasional triumphs  of underprivileged children                                   
	The dreams of around 500 children in the red-light areas of north Calcutta may soon be shattered as their special school which an NGO has been running for the past 38 years can close down any day for want of central funds.        
	The school is supposed to be funded by the Union ministry of women and child development but we have not received any money since 2007. For the past several months, we have been struggling to survive, said Pradipta Kanungo, the general secretary of Bengal Service Society that runs the school.        
	The 20-odd teachers have not been paid for two years, prompting a few to leave, said Kanungo. As a result, the quality of our services has declined drastically.        
	Despite several attempts the secretary and deputy secretary of the Union ministry, Anil Kumar and Anju Bhalla, could not be contacted for comment.        
	But an official of the ministry said the file related to the sanction of the funds was misplaced from the internal finance department a few weeks ago. The funds cannot be released till the file is traced, said the official.        
	According to the centres commitment, the school is supposed to receive more than Rs 21 lakh a year.         
	Students passing out of the school are eligible for admission to Class IX of any mainstream school. Kanungo said there was no problem with funds till the school was under the Union social justice ministry.        
	The jurisdiction changed in October 2007, when the school came under the control of the women and child development ministry. Since then, Kanungo has been running from pillar to post to get the funds flowing but the situation did not improve.        
	The school does not have any building of its own and holds classes on the premises of various local clubs. The clubs are pressing us for funds. Some have asked us to vacate if we cannot pay, which means the school may have to be closed down, said Kanungo.        
	As for the students, most have not received their uniform this year.         
	The schools 72-year-old art teacher, Nemai Adhikary, said stationery has not come for the past year. Children use pencils to draw on a sheet of paper. The drawing is then erased so that the sheet can be used by another student, he said.        
	Earlier, we got eggs, sweets and bread for breakfast. Now they give us only bread and banana, said Anil Mullick, 16, a student of Class VIII. Sports and picnics have not been held for a long time, said Anils classmate Sheikh Salman.        
	Poushali Dutta, a trained teacher who has been associated with the project for the past two years, is among those who have resigned.         
	I live in Bagha Jatin and cannot afford to commute daily to north Calcutta as I am not getting my salary. I wanted to work with underprivileged children and so agreed to take up the job though the salary was a meagre Rs 1,500 a month, she added.

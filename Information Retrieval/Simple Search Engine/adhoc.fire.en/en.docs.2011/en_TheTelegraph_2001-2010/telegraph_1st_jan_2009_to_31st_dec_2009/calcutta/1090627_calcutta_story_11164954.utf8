The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Besu plans tour to attract brains
                                                                                                               Besu plans tour to attract brains
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) has organised a campus tour for the first 1,500 rank holders in JEE 2009 in a bid to attract the best brains.        
	Toppers in the state engineering entrance examination have been preferring other colleges to Besu, where studies had been hampered by violence several times in the past few years.        
	The Open House, from 1.30pm on July 7, will allow the JEE rank-holders a glimpse of life on the Besu campus. The students will be given a guided tour of the campus and told about the different departments, ongoing projects, research and sports facilities and the scholarships available.        
	The session, a brainchild of Besu vice-chancellor Ajoy Kumar Roy, could become an annual affair if this years programme is a success.        
	We have restricted participation to the first 1,500 students to prevent chaos. We are expecting students from both the city and the districts, said Roy.        
	Since higher education is a costly affair, Besu offers 350 scholarships to deserving students of which 88 are sponsored by the Global Alumni Association of Besu, he added. Those wanting to take part in the Open House will have to register on the Internet at www.becs.ac.in or by calling 26687575 (10am to 5pm, June 29 to July 6).

	Thirty puppies huddled in eight tiny cages were rescued on Monday afternoon from a city-based dog breeder who was taking them to an animal fair in Bihar by bus.        
	Police said Manoj Basu, 32, violated rules governing animal transportation and was charged under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act.         
	Basu, who runs a kennel in Garia, was headed for the animal fair at Sonepur with five species of pups  Cocker Spaniel, Labrador, German Shepherd, Spitz and Dachshund. He was arrested just as the bus was leaving Babughat.        
	An animal lover called to say that the puppies were being ferried in a manner that could kill them. We found three to four pups in each cage, measuring just 2.5 by 3.5ft, said an officer at Maidan police station.        
	The police intend handing over the pups to an NGO that takes care of stray animals. According to the law, an animal can be transported only in a container 10 times its size, with proper food and water.

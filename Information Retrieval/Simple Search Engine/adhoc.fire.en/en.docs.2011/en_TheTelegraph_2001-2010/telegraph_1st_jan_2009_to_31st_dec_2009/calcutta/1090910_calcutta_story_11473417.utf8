                                                                                                               Gang steals costly saris
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A gang broke into a shop on Muktarambabu Street taking advantage of the downpour early on Wednesday and decamped with 200 costly saris, worth more than Rs 5 lakh, and Rs 20,000.        
	Shyamlal Agarwal, the owner of Anita Creations, arrived at his shop around 9am to open it and found the locks broken. The showcases and racks were ransacked. One of the drawers was open and the money was missing, said an officer of the detective department.        
	A bundle containing 38 saris was lying on the footpath outside. Police suspect the robbers dropped the bundle while fleeing.        
	A preliminary investigation revealed the burglars spent considerable time inside the shop. They knew saris well. They picked up the costly ones and put them in bundles. They were careful about not letting the rainwater spoil the saris, said an officer.        
	Agarwal had stocked saris worth lakhs for Puja and Diwali. The robbers searched each and every rack. We found saris lying on the floor, said an officer of Girish Park police station.        
	Pavement dwellers told investigators that they saw a group of five to six men walking through the waterlogged Muktarambabu Street with bundles in hand. The pavement dwellers did not notice where the men walked to and could not recollect seeing or hearing any car leaving the area.         
	Joint commissioner (headquarters) Jawed Shamim said the robbers seemed to be from the area or were helped by thieves from the locality.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Crores wasted on soccer stars city visit
                                                                                                                 We Ask You Answer      Crores wasted on soccer stars city visit
          Todays question: Did Diego Maradonas visit do any good to Bengal football?                               
	D.P. Bhattacharya, 
  Sonarpur									      
	Bengal football had a glorious past but due to the lackadaisical attitude of the government the game is in disarray. Talented players in the districts do not get proper coaching. Stadiums are constructed but not maintained. We take foreign footballers in the team at the expense of our own players. Diego Maradonas visit should inspire young footballers but will not do any good to Bengal football.       
	Prabhat Sen SHarma, 
  Chinsurah									      
	Maradonas visit exposed the the organisers whose only intention was to come to the limelight. They are not bothered about the development of Bengal football. The money spent could have been used for the benefit of talented but poor local football players.       
	Suman Pal, 
  Behala									      
	It is unfortunate that the government, which spent money and manpower on the Maradona visit, is not paying any attention to local talent. The event showed us why we cannot produce Maradonas of our own. We will continue to watch World Cups and regret the absence of India, unless long-term strategies are implemented.       
	Subhankar Mukherjee, 
  Burdwan									      
	No magical wind will blow with Maradonas visit that would retrieve our footballing glory. Maradonas visit is the transport ministers bid to pull off a stunt.      
	Satyen Biswas,
  Behala									      
	Maradonas visit is nothing but a gimmick by the sports minister. It cant bring any change in Bengal football. On the contrary, the state ended up paying a lot of money which is meaningless for a developing country like us.      
	Paramananda Pal ,
  Karaya Road									      
	Diego Maradonas visit to Calcutta will definitely encourage footballers. Youngsters must have got tips from him which will help them increase their skill.       
	Indranil Sanyal, 
  Dhakuria									      
	There was no point in spending crores for the tour. A developing country like India cannot afford such luxury. The money could have been spent on a training academy or a sports complex.       
	Debasish Chakraborty, 
  Cossipore									      
	Diego Maradona is a great footballer. I think all Bengal footballers were inspired when they shook hands with him.         
	Sovan Mridha,
  Sonarpur									      
	I think footballers could not learn anything from Maradona because of his short tour.       
	Md Rafi Ahmed, 
  Beniapukur Road									      
	It is great that Maradona visited our city. Thanks to Subhas Chakra-borty who is striving to take Bengal football to the world level. But I cant make out what Maradona did for our football in a day.              
	Suranjan Bonnerjee, 
  Salt Lake									      
	No. The money spent to bring Maradona would have been better spent on our football players.               
	Ranajit Mukherjee, 
  Park Circus									      
	The football academy created in Maradonas name will not bear any result unless the quality of training and infrastructure is very good. People will soon forget Maradonas sincerity, hard work and training. Bengal footballers are far from the international standard.              
	Dilip Kumar Biswas, 
  Green Park									      
	I dont think Maradonas visit can do any good to Bengal football. Footballers could not learn anything from him because he was here for such a short time. But he did point out that Bengal football lacks proper infrastructure. India may participate in the World Cup some day if the infrastructure is developed.
    Rathin Chatterjee, 
  Dum Dum								       
	Maradonas visit is a milestone in the history of Bengal football. Had Maradona visited Calcutta a few years back we would have been grateful to him. But it is a pity he came here eleven years after bidding goodbye to the game.
    Manasi Chakraborty, 
  Address not mentioned									      
	Diego Maradonas visit is nothing but sheer wastage of money. The need of the hour is to help the young footballers to improve their skills with expert coaching and financial help.
    Dinabandhu Mukherjee,
  Behala									        
	Maradona is undoubtedly a great player. But how can a two-day visit by him do any good to Bengals football? The crowd followed him and that impressed him. A few lucky people got the opportunity to have his company. A few magical shots by him impressed the spectators, but it did not help young footballers. Maradona did not have enough time to show his football skills or give tips. He should be invited for a longer period so that footballers can get acquainted with his style.

	Are you riding two-stroke autorickshaws even after they have been banned?

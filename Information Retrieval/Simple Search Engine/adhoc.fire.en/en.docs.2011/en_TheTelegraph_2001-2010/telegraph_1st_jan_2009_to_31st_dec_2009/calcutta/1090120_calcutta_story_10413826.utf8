The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Winter on its last legs
                                                                                                               Winter on its last legs
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcuttas weak winter this year has weakened further, the weatherman warned on Monday.         
	 The North Wind is blowing in from Bihar and Jharkhand. It isnt coming from Kashmir or the extreme north-western part of the country. So, we dont expect a remarkable dip in the minimum temperature over the next few days, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the weather section at Regional Meteorological Centre, in Alipore.        
	The minimum temperature on Monday was 15.8 degrees Celsius and is expected to rise to 17 degrees on Tuesday.        
	The Met office said there was little chance of temperatures dipping over the next 48 hours.        
	The sun has begun its journey towards the Northern Hemisphere, which is why days are becoming longer and warmer. There will only be a trace of cold at night when the North Wind starts blowing in from the north-western parts, an official said.        
	The lowest minimum temperature Calcutta has experienced this season is 12.9 degrees Celsius.        
	It probably wont get colder than that but weather patterns are hard to predict. The coldest day of the season last year was in February, when the minimum temperature plummeted to 10.8 degrees Celsius, the Met office said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sourav in form, with foot
                                                                                                               Sourav in form, with foot
  - Cricket star leads from the front, with skill rather than stamina, in a glam soccer game for Aila victims          PRATIM D. GUPTA                          IS FOOTBALL TOUGHER THAN CRICKET, BABA? Sourav Ganguly takes a breather with daughter Sana in the dugout during the exhibition match to raise money for Aila victims at the Barasat stadium on Sunday evening. (Aranya Sen)                                        
	Just the other day at the Wanderers in far-off South Africa, Sourav Ganguly in black and gold was struggling. The feet werent moving, the ball was whizzing past, the timing just wasnt happening. But on Sunday afternoon at the Vidyasagar Krirangan in Barasat, much closer home, Sourav Ganguly in blue was in form. The feet were nimble, the ball was doing his bidding, the timing was spot-on.        
	The only pity for cricket fans willing him on to end his career on a high with the Knight Riders? Their 37-year-old hero was playing a different ball game, as the captain of the TV XI side in an exhibition soccer match organised by the West Bengal Motion Picture Artists Forum to raise funds for the victims of Aila. Maharaj was up against Mahaguru, Mithun Chakraborty, the skipper of the Film XI team.        
	Denied the captaincy of his KKR team in the second IPL season by John Buchanan and Co, Sourav was quick to strap the yellow arm band on his right arm before kick-off on Sunday as if to say who was boss for the next 70 minutes. But with counterpart Mithun not following suit, the former Team India captain was also quick to drop the captains band. The two skippers, though, were the only players on the field  besides Tolly topper Prosenjit  to turn out in full-length track pants.        
	Once the whistle blew, it took all of 15 seconds for the 15,000-strong Barasat stadium to voice their support for Dada as Sourav sprinted into the rival box to a deafening roar. The touches on the ball, the positional play and the smart kick from the spot that he drilled into the net provided glimpses of a childhood talent that drew gasps and shrieks from Tollywood heroines-cum-cheerleaders.        
	The skill was there, on Sunday, but not the stamina. Seven weeks after returning from South Africa, a match-unfit Maharaj kept turning to the dugout, for sips and substitutions. Midway through the first half, he took a breather and only a head massage during the break revived him for round two. If Sourav the cricketer had seen his team being routed in the last IPL, Sourav the footballer saw his team fight till the tie-breaker, before losing.

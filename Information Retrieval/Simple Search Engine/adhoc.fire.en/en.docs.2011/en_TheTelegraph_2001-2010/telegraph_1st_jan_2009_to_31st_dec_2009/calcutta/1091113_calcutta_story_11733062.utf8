The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Vedika could have been saved
                                                                            Friday , November 13 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Vedika could have been saved
  - Father of 15-year-old who collapsed in school breaks his silence        JHINUK MAZUMDAR                          Vedika Goyal in Gangtok, from the family album                                        
	Tax consultant Ravi Goyal has spent most of his waking hours in the fortnight since his teenage daughters death answering one question: What if?        
	I am not one to dwell on the past but this question keeps coming back to me, and the answer is always the same. I think my daughter would have had a chance of survival if her school had basic medical facilities with at least one teacher trained in resuscitation, said the father of 15-year-old Vedika Goyal, breaking his silence on her death after collapsing on the campus of Ashok Hall Girls Higher Secondary School on October 27.        
	Ravi, in his mid-forties, holds no grudges against the south Calcutta institution but feels it is his duty to raise awareness about city schools lack of preparedness in tackling medical emergencies.        
	What happened to my daughter should not happen to anyone else, he told Metro on Thursday morning, in their rented north Calcutta home.        
	Though the Goyals blamed nobody in the wake of Vedikas death, other students told the family that the teenager received no emergency treatment after collapsing.        
	I was told that the school did not have a stretcher to bring her down from the second floor. There was no oxygen cylinder, which the school can surely afford given the kind of fees they charge (Rs 1,980 per month), Ravi said.        
	Principal Patralekha Ghosh declined comment on the lack of medical facilities and the views of Vedikas parents. We know what we have. We have no comment to make, she told Metro on Thursday evening.        
	Vedika, a student of Class IX at Ashok Hall  off Minto Park  was declared dead on arrival at Belle Vue Clinic around 45 minutes after she was spotted gasping for breath and collapsing near a water filter on the second floor of the school.        
	The teenager had undergone heart surgery at Narayana Hrudayalaya in Bangalore in March 2008 to repair a congenital valve defect but had recovered well to lead a normal life, including participating in extra-curricular activities in school.        
	According to Ravi, someone from the school called him around 8.45am on October 27 to inform him that Vedika had collapsed after vomiting.        
	I remember telling them that they should immediately take her to Belle Vue, just across the road. To my surprise, the caller told me that she could not be shifted to hospital because of protocol. The person told me to please come soon and hung up, he recalled.        
	Ravi and his son Nikhil, a third-year BBA student at JD Birla Institute, set out for the school from 21C Jatindra Mohan Avenue, near Girish Park, within minutes. Along the way, I kept receiving calls from the school. The official first said Vedika would be taken to Woodlands (in Alipore), then called again to say that she would be admitted to Ruby (on the EM Bypass). The constantly changing plans got me even more worried, said the tax consultant.        
	Ravi received a fourth call after five minutes to inform him that Vedika was being taken to Belle Vue, after all. By the time he and Nikhil reached, it was 9.30am and the doctors had declared Vedika brought dead.        
	Our world just crumbled, Ravi said.        
	According to him, the confusion about which hospital Vedika should be admitted to was probably because a clearance was awaited from principal Ghosh, who was not on the campus at the time.

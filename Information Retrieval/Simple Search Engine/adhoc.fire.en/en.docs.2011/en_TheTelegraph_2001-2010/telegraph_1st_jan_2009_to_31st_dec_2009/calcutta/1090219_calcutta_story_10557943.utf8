                                                                                                               Live-in lover denies lying about marriage
          A STAFF REPORTER                           Sanchita Sarkar                                  
	Saupayan Sinha, the youth arrested for allegedly abetting model and aspiring actress Sanchita Sarkars suicide, has contested her brothers allegation that he hid his marital status before moving in with her.        
	Saupayan, a car dealer, was arrested early on Wednesday on the basis of a complaint filed by the Siliguri girls brother, Gautam. He was remanded in police custody till Friday.        
	He told the police that Sanchita, who he had met through common friends, always knew he was married.         
	Gautam had filed his complaint with Lake police station on Tuesday night, blaming Saupayan for his sisters depression and suicide.        
	Abetment can happen in several ways. We are probing what led Sanchita to commit suicide and whether Saupayan had anything to do with it, said Rajesh Subarno, the deputy commissioner of police (south).         
	Sanchita was found hanging from the ceiling fan of her rented house near Jodhpur Park on Monday.         
	She left no suicide note.

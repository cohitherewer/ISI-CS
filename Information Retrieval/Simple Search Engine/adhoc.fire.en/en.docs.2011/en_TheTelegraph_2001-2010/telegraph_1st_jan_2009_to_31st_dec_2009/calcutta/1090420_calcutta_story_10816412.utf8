The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | German business focus on Calcutta
                                                                                                               German business focus on Calcutta
          SUBHRO SAHA                              
	Germany has put Calcutta back on its radar after a years gap as a potential business destination.         
	A 25-member mixed-bag business team from the German state of Lower Saxony will touch down on Calcutta for a reconnoitre and match-making trip from April 30 to May 1.        
	This is a significant development which can not only put Bengal-German business dialogue back on track but also repair the damage, to some extent, our reputation suffered in Germany following the Tatas pullout from Singur, B.G. Roy, the regional director of Indo-German Chamber of Commerce (IGCC), Calcutta, told Metro.        
	Following a flood of biz teams that visited Calcutta after the successful food-processing delegation in 2005 that led to Metro Cash amp; Carry setting up shop in town, the trail had gone cold.        
	The Nano had fired the imagination of the Germans.... There was huge interest, since over 60 per cent of the Nanos components come from Germany, stressed Bernhard Steinruecke, the director-general of IGCC.        
	Wilfried Prewo, the CEO of the Hannover Chamber of Industry and Commerce who will accompany the German team, echoed Steinruecke: Yes, the Nano has done great damage.        
	While the Tatas pullout made a big dent in the perception of the city among German business captains, the inordinate delay by the Bengal government in issuing a key licence to Metro Cash amp; Carry dealt another blow, felt Roy.        
	The picture only got gloomier with Lufthansa reverting to a thrice-weekly flight schedule from the five-times-a-week timetable and British Airways bidding farewell to the city.         
	The Lower Saxony squad with multiple areas of interest is being led by Philipp Roesler, the minister for economics, labour and transport. He will meet chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to discuss possible domains of dialogue. One-to-one matchmaking meetings are on the cards.        
	The team will have representation from the sectors of agri-business, industrial products, navigation, communications, traffic management, biotechnology, education, law and IT.

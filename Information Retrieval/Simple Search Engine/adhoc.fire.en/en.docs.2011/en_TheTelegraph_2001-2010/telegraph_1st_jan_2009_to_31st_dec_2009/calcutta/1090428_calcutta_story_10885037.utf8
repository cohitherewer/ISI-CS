                                                                                                               Youth held for 50-lakh theft 
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A 30-year-old former student of a reputable boarding school in north Bengal was arrested in his Santoshpur home on Sunday for allegedly stealing Rs 50 lakh from the investment consultant he assisted. The cash has not been recovered.        
	Fakiruddin Mondal, alias Rajesh, had been working for Deep Jyoti Banerjee, a consultant to several business houses, for the past five years. He used to visit Banerjees clients in his car, pick up cash and deposit it in banks. Fakiruddins brother Sadik usually drove the car.         
	On April 23, Banerjee called Fakiruddin and asked him to be on Wood Street in the afternoon so that they could visit banks to deposit around Rs 50 lakh. The two met around 2.30pm. Banerjee got into his own car after handing over the amount to Fakiruddin in a briefcase and asking him to follow, said an officer.        
	Fakiruddins car, which was being driven by his brother, followed Banerjees for a few minutes before disappearing. Banerjee tried to call Fakiruddin but found his cellphone switched off. After waiting till evening, Banerjee went to the youths home and found him missing. Even Sadik was gone, added the officer.        
	According to the police, Banerjee and his wife trusted Fakiruddin, who did not continue his studies after passing the Class X board exams, so much that they had even told him their financial details. The consultant had also been to the house in Kankhuli, Santoshpur, where the brothers lived with their parents.         
	Acting on a complaint by the investment consultant, the police activated their sources and learnt on Sunday evening that Fakiruddin had returned home. He was arrested at night.        
	So far Fakiruddin has only named associates who we already knew about. The entire amount has been hidden somewhere, said a senior officer of Shakespeare Sarani police station handling the case.

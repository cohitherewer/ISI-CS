The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Row over spot checking rule
                                                                                                               Row over spot checking rule
  - Schools oppose board move          MITA MUKHERJEE                          Students and parents check the ICSE results at a city school. A Telegraph picture                                        
	Most ICSE/ISC schools have opposed the decision of the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations to introduce centralised evaluation of answer scripts from the next academic session.        
	Some school heads have even threatened not to allow their teachers to attend spot evaluation camps, worried over their safety during their fortnight-long stay away from home.        
	We have requested the council to reconsider its decision. Before going into any confrontation we are trying to explain our problems to the council, said Norton Emanuel, the principal of Methodist School and the president of the Association of Heads of ICSE Schools.        
	The council, however, is firm in its stand to introduce spot assessment from next year. Each school will have to send at least one teacher for each subject at both ICSE and ISC levels. Action will be taken against schools that will violate the rule, said Gerry Arathoon, the officiating chief executive and secretary of the council.        
	In an attempt to speed up the publication of ICSE/ISC results and ensure that the assessment is error-free, the council has decided to end the practice of teachers taking scripts home for evaluation. Instead, the scripts will have to be assessed at designated centres and schools have been asked to grant 15 days leave to teachers who would attend the evaluation sessions. The centres will be set up in cities and towns where there are at least 10 ICSE/ISC schools.        
	The schools fear a fortnights leave for teachers would disrupt their academic activities. It will be difficult to conduct our daily activities if senior teachers do not take classes for so many days in March when the annual exams are held, said a principal of a south Calcutta school.        
	The principals of schools in suburbs fear about the safety of their teachers during their stay at the assessment centres.         
	Who will arrange for safe accommodation for our young lady teachers for a fortnight? wondered the principal of a Hooghly school.        
	Some heads feel the teachers would be taxed if they are asked to sit at one place and correct scripts for seven hours at a stretch. They may make more mistakes because of fatigue, said Gilian Rosemary Hart, the principal of Welland Gouldsmith School and the president of the Association of Heads of Anglo-Indian Schools.

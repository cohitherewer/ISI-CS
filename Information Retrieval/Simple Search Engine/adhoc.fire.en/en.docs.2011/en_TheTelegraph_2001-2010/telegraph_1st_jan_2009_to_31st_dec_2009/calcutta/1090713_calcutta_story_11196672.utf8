The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Colleges in a fix over teacher norms
                                                                                                               Colleges in a fix over teacher norms
  - UGC directive comes in the middle of recruitment process          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                              
	The state government will seek a clarification from the University Grants Commission on its recent notification which states that candidates must clear the National Eligibility Test or the State Level Eligibility Test to be appointed college or university teachers.         
	In 2002, the UGC had exempted MPhil and PhD degree holders from clearing one of the exams to become lecturers. Once the latest notification comes into effect, they will have to clear NET or SLET to teach in colleges or universities.        
	The directive has put the government in a fix since it came while the process of appointing lecturers and professors is underway.        
	A large number of PhD and MPhil degree holders  who have not cleared NET or SLET  have applied for the vacant posts.        
	We will write to the UGC to ask whether we should appoint PhD and MPhil degree holders who had been called for interviews before the revised notification was issued, said a member of the committee set up by the government to examine the notification.        
	The panel comprising Calcutta University vice-chancellor Suranjan Das, Jadavpur University vice-chancellor P.N. Ghosh, Vidyasagar University vice-chancellor Swapan Paramanik and the chairman of the West Bengal Council for Higher Education, Subimal Sen, met for the first time on July 4 and decided to seek a clarification from the UGC.        
	In 2002, the UGC had exempted PhD and MPhil degree holders from clearing NET or SLET to deal with shortage of faculty in higher education institutes.         
	According to UGC sources, the relaxation of rules led to PhD and MPhil degree holders who were not up to the mark applying for the post of lecturers. There was also an increase in the number institutes offering MPhil online and through distance education. The UGC decided to return to the old system to ensure that teaching standards in colleges and universities did not decline.        
	The UGC, in another recent notification, laid down the norms for MPhil and PhD courses. The norms lay stress on proper admission procedure and regular attendance by students.         
	We are examining how to run the PhD and MPhil courses as suggested by the UGC, said Das.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Celsius rise amp; light rain 
                                                                                                               Celsius rise amp; light rain 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	The chill will continue to play hide and seek with the city this week, says the weatherman, as the minimum temperature rises but a light rain falls.        
	We expect the minimum temperature in the city to rise to about 18 degrees Celsius and there is possibility of light rain in the next 48 hours, G.C. Debnath, the director of the weather section at the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore, said on Monday.        
	The minimum temperature started rising from Monday  15.5 degrees Celsius against Sundays 12.9. The normal minimum temperature at this time of the year is around 13 degrees.        
	Met officials explained that a western disturbance in the north-western part of the country had blocked the passage of the North Wind. Also, the wind pattern has changed with moisture-laden winds blowing from the south-east.        
	Under the combined effect of the two atmospheric systems, the minimum temperature has risen to two degrees above normal, a Met official said.        
	The moisture-laden winds from the Bay of Bengal have led to the formation of rain clouds over the city and its adjoining areas.        
	We expect light rain and as the sky remains cloudy or partly cloudy, the gap between the maximum and minimum temperature is expected to narrow. So we will feel colder by day, said a Met official.        
	A series of western disturbances has blocked the North Wind several times this winter. But Met officials said on Tuesday that there would be another round of winter chill before long.        
	Once the western disturbance moves away and the sky clears, the North Wind will blow unhindered bringing in the chill, said an official.              
	Mild quake        
	The city felt a mild tremor on Monday afternoon. No damage was reported.        
	Met officials said it was a mild earthquake measuring 3.4 on the Richter scale.        
	We located the epicentre about 140km north-east of Calcutta. It lasted about 72 seconds, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the weather section at the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.        
	Several parts of the city reported feeling the tremor at 12.34pm on Monday. The tremor settled completely within a minute.        
	The depth of the tremor was over 50km. The epicentre was traced to Assam.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Jackal on runway
                                                                                                               Jackal on runway
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A Mumbai-Calcutta Air India flight was forced to hover in the city sky for 15 minutes on Monday after the air traffic control (ATC) at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport warned the pilot of a jackal straying on the runway.        
	Airport officials said that at 9am, the pilot of a Bangalore-Calcutta IndiGo flight that had just landed spotted the animal and informed the ATC.        
	ATC officials passed on the message to the Air India pilot and instructed him to hover for 15 minutes. The flight landed at 9.15am after the jackal was shooed away, said an airport official.        
	Metro had earlier reported about repeated incidents of jackals entering the runway and disrupting flights.        
	The airport official said a team from the forest department had visited the area around the airport last year to conduct a survey and relocate the animals.         
	A survey was conducted but nothing was done after that, said the official.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cool comfort on wheels for city commuters 
                                                                                                               Cool comfort on wheels for city commuters 
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Style and safety: The low-floor bus that may hit the city streets soon. Picture by Kishor Roychowdhury                                  
	A fleet of Volvo buses could soon hit the city roads if three private operators have their way. They have expressed interest in operating the buses on multiple routes in Calcutta. Such buses already ply in Pune and Bangalore.        
	The state transport department, too, is ready to buy a fleet of buses with funds from the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission. Government sources said 25 to 50 new buses are likely to be introduced in the city soon.        
	Metro took a ride on a Volvo 8400 to check out whats on offer for commuters.        
	Entry and Exit        
	 This is a low- floor bus, so passengers wont have to climb a flight of steps to board the vehicle. Two hydraulic gates  one in the middle and the other at the front  open wide, ensuring smooth access. Private buses currently on the road have two narrow gates at two ends.        
	The floor of the Volvo can be lowered even more and a ramp rolled out for the benefit of wheelchair-bound commuters.        
	The doors remain closed while the bus moves so that people cannot get on or off.        
	Interiors        
	The bus can seat 38 people, about the same as the current crop of private buses. The seats are arranged in two rows. The space above the rear wheels can be used to keep luggage or to seat passengers.        
	With the engine located at the back, the bus is raised at the rear, where there is a long row of seats.        
	There are large glass panes in place of the wooden holes that pass for bus windows now. On one side, above the panes, is an electronic display board for passengers. The drivers section is ergonomically designed.         
	Comfort        
	The bus is air-conditioned. The driver can adjust the temperature depending on the weather.        
	The vehicle has automatic transmission so passengers will not have to contend with jerky gear shifts. Comfortable seats and reduced outside noise make for a smooth ride.        
	Safety        
	The glass panes cannot be pierced or shattered easily. There is also little chance of any object piercing the buss undercarriage and injuring a passenger as had happened recently when the tyre of a private bus burst.        
	The drivers will be trained at designated schools and have to clear tests more stringent than those conducted for handing out licences.         
	The doors will be fitted with sensors so that no one gets trapped.        
	Cost        
	The buses are priced at Rs 78 lakh. Ticket prices will depend on the agreement between the operators and the transport department.        
	It will also depend on a host of factors such as the number of hours an operator would like to run the bus, the maintenance cost and the durability of the bus.        
	Officials of one of the private operators said in Bangalore, the rates vary from Rs 5 to Rs 25.

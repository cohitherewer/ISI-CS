The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | HS teachers boycott evaluation
                                                                                                               HS teachers boycott evaluation
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	More than 300 schoolteachers have refused to evaluate Higher Secondary answer scripts of computer science and computer applications, casting a cloud on timely declaration of the results.        
	The teachers, all working part-time, demanded their jobs be made permanent and that school education minister Partha Dey withdraw his disparaging remarks about them.        
	Starting Tuesday, the state HS council has organised three-day camps across the state for evaluation of the 60,000 answer scripts of the two papers. The 300-odd teachers boycotted the camps on Tuesday and threatened to do so even on Wednesday and Thursday.        
	The minister had allegedly denied the existence of the part-time teachers and said the two computer papers were taught by full-time teachers of other science subjects.        
	What De had said was absolutely wrong. There are 900 part-time teachers in HS schools who have been recruited to teach the two papers. It is not possible for a teacher of physics, chemistry, mathematics or biology to teach computer science or computer application at the plus-II level. Its clear from the ministers statement that the government will never make our jobs permanent, said Tarun Bhaskar, the president of the All Bengal Computer Teachers Association.        
	The council has decided to declare the HS results between the third and fourth weeks of May. But it will be impossible to meet the deadline if we do not get the marks of all the subjects by the end of this month, said a council official.        
	Swapan Sarkar, the secretary of the council, said talks are on with the protesting teachers to find a way out of the impasse.

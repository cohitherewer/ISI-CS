The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Permit raj ends for old vehicles
                                                                                                               Permit raj ends for old vehicles
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The transport department has decided not to renew the route permits of commercial vehicles 15 years and older as part of the first concerted attempt with the environment department to implement the courts phase-out order.        
	Advocate-general Balai Ray informed Calcutta High Court on Wednesday that no commercial vehicle would be considered for renewal of its route permit after completing 15 years on the road.        
	What it means is that vehicles will automatically become ineligible for two mandatory documents at the end of 15 years: the route permit and the pollution-control certificate.        
	The transport department had first issued a notification on the phase-out of commercial vehicles 15 years and older on May 24, 2005, but the Bengal Bus Syndicate moved court and obtained an injunction against the move.        
	Minister Subhas Chakrabortys department did appeal against the stay in a division bench but seemed in no hurry to push for a verdict in its favour. The appeal was twice dismissed by the division bench because nobody representing the government turned up for the hearings.        
	The transport departments move to announce in court that it wont renew the route permits of old commercial vehicles is being seen as a victory for the green lobby. But given the governments track record we will not believe it till we see it being implemented, said an activist.

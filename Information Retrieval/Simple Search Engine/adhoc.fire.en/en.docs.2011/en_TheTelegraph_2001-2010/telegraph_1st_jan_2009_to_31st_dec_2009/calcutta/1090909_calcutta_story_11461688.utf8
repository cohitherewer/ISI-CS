                      Small is beautiful                    Though often overlooked, small format art can provide interesting insight into its owners personality, style and aesthetic sense. Affordable, collectible and capable of becoming eye-catching displays, such works of art are becoming increasingly popular among art lovers. The ongoing group exhibition, featuring small-format works by artists and printmakers, attempts to highlight current trends. One of the last original Kalighat chitrakars, Bhaskar Chitrakar is a young artist living and working in Kalighat. His watercolour and tempera works on paper include unusual versions of gods and goddesses, as well as quirky commentaries on present-day society. Bikas Karmakars acrylics on board also offer humorous, caustic interpretations of everyday living, seen through the eyes of a young artist. Viraag Desais woodcuts and acrylics carry a range of motifs to illustrate different social behaviour; from struggle and domination to resigned acceptance. Goutam Sarkars small acrylics on canvas are a visual delight in their use of bold strokes and vibrant colours, depicting the expressive faces of rural folk. Also on display are small prints of old Bengal-style paintings, and pen amp; ink works by Atish Mukherjee, inspired by nature and based on Indian folk art like Madhubani and Warli.

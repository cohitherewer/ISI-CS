          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 40-year-old railway employee walked into Bowbazar police station on Sunday evening and allegedly admitted to having murdered his wife in their Sonarpur home two days ago.        
	Standing before an officer, Amit Kumar Das gave a blow-by-blow account of how he killed his wife Sharmistha, said cops.        
	According to an investigator, Amit was on the run since strangling the homemaker in their railway quarters on Friday. He suspected her of having an extra-marital affair.        
	Amit called up his in-laws home in Konnagar on Saturday night and told them that he had murdered his wife. He also told them that he was going to surrender before the cops and confess to his crime, said an officer of Sonarpur police station.        
	Sharmisthas parents immediately contacted the local police station and rushed to Sonarpur. The officers recovered the womans decomposed body.        
	Amit, Sharmistha and their three children visited the Konnagar house on Friday morning. They returned home in the evening, without the children.        
	Amit told his in-laws that he would return after a couple of days to fetch the children, said an officer.        
	The couple had an altercation at night. I lost my cool and pounced on her. I strangled her to death, Amit allegedly told investigators.        
	A team of officers from Bowbazar police station handed over Amit to Sonarpur police station on Sunday. We will produce Amit in court on Monday, said an officer of Sonarpur police station.

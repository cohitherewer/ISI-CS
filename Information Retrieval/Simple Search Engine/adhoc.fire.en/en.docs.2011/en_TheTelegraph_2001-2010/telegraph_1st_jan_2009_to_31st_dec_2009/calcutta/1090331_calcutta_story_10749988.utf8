  - City to host its first fashion week with stars and stitches galore          SMITA ROY CHOWDHURY                          M.S. Dhoni is busy in New Zealand but buddy John Abraham with girlfriend Bipasha will be here                                        
	Brand ambassador Mahendra Singh Dhoni will be busy on the Wellington pitch in faraway New Zealand, but buddy John Abraham will lead a star shower on the Kolkata Fashion Week (KFW) ramp later this week.        
	Some of the hottest bods of the glam world will dazzle in designs by some of Indian fashions best from April 2 to 5 at PC Chandra Greens on the EM Bypass, in the high-profile event partnered by t2.        
	Bipasha Basu, Chitrangada Singh, Raima Sen, Ria Sen, Neha Dhupia, Minissha Lamba, Mugdha Godse, Sagarika Ghatge, Mahi Gill the list of showstoppers goes on and on. Yesteryears style icon Zeenat Aman will join todays hotties on the ramp while June and Shreya Pande lend a local touch. Joining John in the boys room will be actor Dino Morea, director Imtiaz Ali and VJ Rannvijay Singh.        
	The showstoppers we have lined up will more than make up for Dhonis absence, said Yudhajit Dutta of Mindscapes Maestros, the organising group of KFW.         
	This is the first time that I have endorsed such an event and I have high expectations from KFW. I will miss being there for the first season but it is a biannual event, so I will certainly be there the next time. I am all geared up, the Team India skipper said from New Zealand.        
	The fashion week celebrates the International Year of Natural Fibre and the theme  Return To Roots  finds shape in one Weaves show on each of the four days. The aim is to showcase the traditional weaves of Bengal like tangail, garad, baluchari, dhuti and gamchha.              
	I am really looking forward to the KFW show. I was part of the first ever fashion week in Delhi and I am glad to be part of the very first fashion week happening in Calcutta, Neha Dhupia said from Mumbai. The city is full of talented artists and really good designers. I had walked the ramp in Calcutta long ago for Ritu Kumar and I am very happy to be going there again.        
	That a fashion week was long overdue in Calcutta is stressed by June. I always used to think why only Delhi and Mumbai and why not Calcutta after all, we have some of the best designers of the country. I am very glad that a fashion week is finally happening here, she smiles.        
	If theres star power on the ramp, the designers clothing the glam brigade are stars by themselves. One can expect a trademark high-voltage finale from king of drama Rohit Bal on Sunday evening. Narendra Kumar will be showing his mens wear line, Wendell Rodricks will bring a black-and-white collection, while Cue by Rohit Gandhi and Rahul Khanna will come with an Ode to Joy.                     
	The design biggies from beyond Bengal include Bibi Russell from Bangladesh, Manoviraj Khosla, Anjana Bhargav, Shane and Falguni Peacock, Zubair Kirmani and Gauri Nainika.        
	The Calcutta story will be stitched together by Sharbari Datta, Monapali, Soumitra Mondal, Dev r Nil and Abhishek Dutta.        
	Theres more to KFW than the star sparkle. Business prospects, for once, seem bright. About 50 to 60 buying houses have confirmed participation. We have got registrations from buyers all over India, as well as international ones from Europe, the US and South-East Asia, reveals Dutta.

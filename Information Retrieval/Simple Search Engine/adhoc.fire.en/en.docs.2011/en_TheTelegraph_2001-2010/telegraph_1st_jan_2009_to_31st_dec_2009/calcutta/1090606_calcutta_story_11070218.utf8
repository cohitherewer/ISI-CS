The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Power returns at dusk
                                                                                                               Power returns at dusk
  - Repaired CESC mainstay kicks in after 2-day torment          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Calcutta sweated and fretted over power cuts for the second consecutive day but the lights came on  and stayed  after CESC switched on its repaired Budge Budge unit by evening.        
	We dont have any shortfall now. The repaired 250MW unit is up and running, a senior CESC official said around 7pm.        
	The central business district bore the brunt of Fridays power cuts, which stretched up to four hours in some places.        
	From Mangoe Lane to Mission Row  dotted with shops dealing in computer accessories and automobile spares  trade volumes dropped as the day wore on and power played truant.        
	Electricity went off as soon as we opened our shop in the morning, said an automobile spare parts shop owner. It returned after a while but four hours of loadshedding from 2 till 6pm ruined the day.        
	Dimple Chattwal, who operates from Mangoe Lane, said traders spent much of the day standing outside their shops because it was stifling in the small rooms without lights and fans.        
	The power crisis also took its toll at the other end of town, in a very different milieu, as Tollygunge Club chief executive and managing member A.R. Mukerji and his team had a difficult time keeping all the facilities going.        
	It (power) came and went on Thursday, and again on Friday. We did not have power for six hours. Guests were inconvenienced because we couldnt run the airconditioners. Squash and tennis were disrupted. We have power back-up but not for such severe power cuts, said Mukerji.        
	The power crisis began after the Budge Budge unit, one of the mainstays of CESC, was shut down on Wednesday night to repair a tube leak .        
	As the duration of the power cuts increased on Thursday afternoon, residents of some areas resorted to roadblocks in a rerun of the post-Aila protests.         
	Fridays shortfall was around 170MW at noon, causing widespread power cuts.        
	We switched on the Budge Budge unit at 3.36pm and it picked up generation by 6.30pm. At 7pm, the two operating units of the Budge Budge plant were generating 454MW, a CESC spokesperson said.         
	The shortfall had ranged between 200 and 290MW on Thursday evening.        
	CESC procured around 150MW from Chhattisgarh and another 100MW from a different source on Friday morning.        
	The West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company supplied 471MW.

                      Masterpieces of Japanese art                    Japanese art covers a wide range of styles and media, including ancient pottery, sculpture in wood and bronze, ink painting on silk and paper, and a myriad other types of works of art. Historically, Japan has been subject to sudden invasions of new and alien ideas followed by long periods of minimal contact with the outside world. Over time, the Japanese developed the ability to absorb, imitate and finally assimilate elements of foreign culture that complemented their aesthetic preferences. Today, Japan rivals most modern nations in its contribution to modern art, fashion and architecture, with creations of a truly modern, global and multi-cultural bent. A typical Japanese lacquer-based art, Urushi is very thick and sticky, and leaves a clear trail of bubbles and brushstrokes behind the stiff brush bristles. But these ridges and bumps completely vanish within a few seconds, leaving a perfect unbroken reflection on the surface. Developing traditional Urushi techniques into new works, eminent Japanese artist Higashibata Yui makes the best use of wooden bases, undercoats, materials, colourings and textures, consistently working on traditional bases and adding innovative styles to them at the same time. Showcasing the traditional techniques and the creative wisdom of Japan, the ongoing exhibition features masterpieces of lacquer and focuses mainly on Japanese pottery, traditional sculpture with Washi, a kind of translucent paper, paper art and bamboo art, which is regarded as a mysterious element and is associated with anything auspicious in Japan. Hosted by Weavers Studio Centre for the Arts, in association with Consulate General of Japan in Calcutta and ICCR.

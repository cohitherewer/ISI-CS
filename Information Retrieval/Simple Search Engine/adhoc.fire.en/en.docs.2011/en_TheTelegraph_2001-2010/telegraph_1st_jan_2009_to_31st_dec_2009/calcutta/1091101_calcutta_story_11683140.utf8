The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pop art on the   wall
                                                                                                               Pop art on the   wall
                                            A poster on display       
	After Magic Wallrush I, II, and 2.8, the third (or fourth?) edition is here and you can catch it hanging from a wall on Sunday, November 1 at the Park Street-Free School Street crossing, near T3.         
	Led by college students Opashona Ghosh, Arka Alam and Arijit Sett, Wallrush is an art experiment that exhibits everything from pop art to photographs, paintings to music.         
	Covered by Levis India on their website, the exhibition will be about many things. From Arjun Vijayas graphic art on paper and converse shoes to students takes on Calcutta and experiments with period photographs, it promises to be a visual treat. There will be art table lamps to posters and T-shirts, and a lot of Beatles covers. Bhaskar Dutta with his Trippy Slippers and a Few Yellow Bricks will perform live with a bunch of musician friends.                    MALINI BANERJEE

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Election data drive launched
                                                                                                               Election data drive launched
          A STAFF REPORTER                          An Election Watch banner                                  
	The Bengal chapter of National Election Watch, a campaign by 1,200-plus NGOs and civil society organisations to help voters make an informed choice, was launched at a city bookstore on Monday.        
	Information about candidates will be made available to voters over the phone, through SMS and on the Net as part of the drive. This is a proud moment for all of us. The Election Watch is an honest effort to put an end to criminalisation of politics and unethical poll practices, General (retired) Shankar Roychowdhury, the chairman of the chapter, told Metro.        
	The campaign was started by the Association for Democratic Reform, an NGO founded by academicians and alumni of leading institutions, in 1999. A PIL filed by it in December 1999 led to a Supreme Court order in March 2003 making disclosure of criminal, financial and educational backgrounds of candidates mandatory.         
	The association has organised election watch for the 2004 Lok Sabha polls and several Assembly elections.        
	Describing the Election Watch as an exemplary initiative, Bengals chief electoral officer Debashis Sen pointed out that the poll panel had issued a circular on April 2 recognising and acknowledging the role of the media and civil society in holding fair elections.

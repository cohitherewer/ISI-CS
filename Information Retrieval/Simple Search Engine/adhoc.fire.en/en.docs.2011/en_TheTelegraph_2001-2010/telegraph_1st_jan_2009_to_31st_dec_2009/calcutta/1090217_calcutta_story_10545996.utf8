The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Scotland on a plate

	Imagine gorging on Scotch eggs, highland meatballs and fish cakes instead of the staple Benfish fare at the Book Fair! Visitors to the recently concluded fair did just that, as the Scottish Food Festival took off near the Childrens Pavilion on February 3, 5 and 6.         
	This is an extension of the theme of the fair. We hoped to introduce a bit of Scotland to Calcutta through the taste buds, said Daniel Martelat, a lecturer on food and hospitality at Telford College in Edinburgh.         
	Martelat, his colleague Hugh McCluskey (curriculum leader, professional cookery), and six students of the college had come to the city on an exchange programme with IIAS School of Management. They intended to learn more about the citys cuisine and impart knowledge about their own.        
	The elaborate spread at the Book Fair included Scotch eggs, scones, macaroons, highland meatballs, croquette potatoes, fish cakes, fish and chips, ginger snap, Scottish cookies and black buns.         
	While the Scotch eggs were a delightful mix of minced meat on egg, the croquettes were a deep-fried vegetarian treat, stuffed with carrot, courgette and potatoe. Needless to say, the festival saw heavy footfall on all three days.        
	The food being served is part of a traditional Scottish spread, said Martelat. Haggis (a preparation made from the offal of lamb), Scottish dumpling and short bread complete the list.        
	Eleanor Watson and Alan Piper, both students of Telford College, could not stop gushing about their experience in the city. The food here is very spicy but Im enjoying it, said Watson. Martelat, who occasionally cooks Indian food at home, also admitted that the curries available in Scotland were very different from the ones cooked here.        
	Students pursuing a Higher National Diploma at IIAS can finish their course in two years and do the second year in Scotland. Im sure the international exposure will help us gain more confidence, said Shayan Banerjee, a first-year student of the course. His friend Atin Das was only too eager to describe the scones and black buns that he savoured. We were taught how to make these delicacies too, he added.

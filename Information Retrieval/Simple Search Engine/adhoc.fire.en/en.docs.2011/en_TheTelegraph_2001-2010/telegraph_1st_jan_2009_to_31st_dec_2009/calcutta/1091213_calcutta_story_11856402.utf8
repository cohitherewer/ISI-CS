	The dig at people who watch shows like Dadagiri Unlimited (50 reasons not to marry a Bengali man, October 4) is totally unwarranted. The show is extremely popular throughout Bengal and all credit goes to Sourav Ganguly, our gourav, our pride. Dada resides in our hearts and will continue to do so.

	My initial reaction to Dadagiri Unlimited was most favourable and I was a regular viewer of show. But as the days passed, the episodes turned out to be just hero worship and now it is blatant idolisation of a lost hero of Bengal.

	The report Calcutta questions(November 8) brilliantly analysed the problems faced by Calcuttans. NGOs should now approach various government departments for redress armed with the facts provided in the article. This would make life of the average Calcuttan much better.

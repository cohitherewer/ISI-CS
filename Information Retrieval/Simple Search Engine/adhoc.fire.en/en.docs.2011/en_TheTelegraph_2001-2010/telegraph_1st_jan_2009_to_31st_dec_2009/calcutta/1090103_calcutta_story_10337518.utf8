Students of Apex Academy of Professional Excellence, Institute of Management Study, Globsyn Business School, IISWBM and other institutes under AIMA attended the meet. It was the fourth seminar organised, as part of an Education Series, the previous ones being held at Mumbai, New Delhi and Bangalore.        
	Rekha Sethi, the director-general of AIMA, kicked off the discussion with a lecture on the prevalent economic crisis.         
	Sam Pitroda, the chairman of NKC, detailed the activities of NKC through a presentation. Set up almost three years ago to look into knowledge structures and institutions, the NKC has already submitted many recommendations to the government. The real challenge now is the implementation, added Pitroda.         
	He also spoke of translation as an upcoming career option. Still in a nascent form, it could provide 250,000 jobs in the future, the NKC chairman said.         
	Sanjiv Goenka, the senior VP of AIMA and the vice-chairman of RPG Enterprise, stressed how local autonomy and better management of funds could improve our education system.         
	About 80% of our children are in government schools, studying in dilapidated leaky rooms. Dont they deserve better? he asked the audience.

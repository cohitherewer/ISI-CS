	A homemaker in her late 30s who had lodged a complaint against a constable for allegedly molesting her on a minibus has been threatened with dire consequences if she does not withdraw the charge.         
	Around 2.30pm last Friday, a tall, well-built man dressed in black entered Shampa Duttas single-storeyed house in Phoolbagan and called out to her from the grille inside the main gate. Shampas husband Subodh, a trader, and their 22-year-old son were away on work. She was home with her 11-year-old daughter.         
	According to Shampa, when she came to the gate and identified herself, the man, around 40 years old, advised her to withdraw her complaint against Dharanidhar Pati of Entally police station for her own benefit.        
	When she asserted that she wanted justice and would not withdraw the complaint, the man reportedly said: Spare me your dialogue. We know everything about you and your family. If you dont withdraw the complaint, the consequences will be severe. He then cycled away.         
	On January 21 evening, the constable in his 50s had allegedly continued harassing Shampa on a crowded minibus, while she was on her way to a dinner with her daughter, until she hit him with her sandal. Pati got off the bus and tried to run away but was caught by other passengers and pedestrians.         
	The constable was arrested after Shampa lodged a complaint with Entally police station. The internal inquiry against Pati is on. He has been suspended and hence is getting only half his salary, said an officer of the police station. A chargesheet is yet to be issued in the case.         
	On Monday, Shampa went to the police station and informed the officers about the incident. They asked her to lodge a complaint with her local police station.         
	After consulting her family, Shampa lodged a general diary with Phoolbagan police station. Some of the constables in the police station asked me to forget the matter but the officer-in-charge gave me his phone number and assured me of help, said the homemaker.         
	Our neighbours had asked us not to lodge a complaint against a cop but my wife went ahead. They also asked us to keep quiet about Fridays incident but we are determined to not bow to pressure from any quarter, said Subodh.

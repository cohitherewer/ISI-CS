  - 11 of a family drugged and robbed        A STAFF REPORTER                                                        
	A newly hired cook drugged 11 members of a central Calcutta household on Thursday night and made off with valuables before the lone witness  a teenager who had skipped dinner to chat online  could seek help.        
	Rishika Jhunjhunwalla, 15, watched in horror as 10 members of her joint family and a help lay in a drug-induced stupor in different rooms and cook Raju went about emptying the cupboards. Her four-year-old brother Kushagra was asleep, too, but not drugged.        
	Two of the victims were in the intensive care unit of Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals till late on Friday. The rest, including Rishikas parents and elder sister, remained under observation in the same hospital, though a medical bulletin described their condition as stable.        
	Raju had apparently spiked the Jhunjhunwalla familys dinner of puri, vegetable curry and mango shake with a strong sedative and waited for everyone to doze off before carrying out the second half of his plan.        
	The cook, recruited to work at 26B Creek Row only three days ago, had an accomplice who Rishika hadnt seen before.        
	I was in my room and had no idea what was going on until I shut down my laptop and came out. I saw Raju in a dark-coloured shirt and blue jeans quickly removing things from a cupboard and putting them into a huge bag. There was another person in light blue shirt and jeans with him, Rishika told Metro.        
	The teenagers first instinct was to scream, but she fell silent when Rajus accomplice charged at her with a sharp object. He hit me in the stomach and asked me to keep mum. I went back to my room and did as I was told, Rishika said.        
	By the time the Class IX student called for help  she dialled Pankaj Jain, the Orkut friend with whom she had been chatting a little earlier  Raju and his accomplice had fled the two-storeyed Jhujhunwalla House with the booty. It was only after the duos departure that Rishika realised another resident  the familys third help, Shiva  was missing.        
	According to police, Pankaj received his online friends call at 12.10am. He and another youth reached Creek Row from Amherst Street, less than a kilometre away, on a motorcycle and sought help from two policemen who were on night duty in the locality. They entered the house to find the rest of the family unconscious and in physical distress, a police official said.        
	A team from Muchipara police station arrived around 1.15am with ambulances and took the victims to hospital.        
	Damayanti Sen, the deputy commissioner of police (central), said the Jhunjhunwallas had recruited Raju on the advice of the absconding Shiva, who had worked for the family for only six months.        
	Sen said the worth of the stolen valuables would be known only after the adult members of the family recovered.        
	While the hospital said the family was sedated with an unknown substance, a forensic expert told Metro that it could be benzo-dizepines.        
	Samples of the food cooked in the Jhunjhunwalla kitchen on Thursday night have been sent for tests along with dahi and rosogolla found in the refrigerator.         
	The police have also created identikits of Raju and Shiva  the family does not have photographs of either  on the basis of Rishikas description. The Jhunjhunwallas deal in plastics and have been residents of Creek Row for decades. The first floor of the house has eight rooms.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Airline unveils city plans
                                                                                                               Airline unveils city plans
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Paramount Airways, which launched operations in the city on Monday with business class only flights to Chennai and Agartala via Guwahati, has ambitious expansion plans in the region.         
	The airline is planning to connect Calcutta to Delhi, Mumbai and destinations in the Northeast. It will also take up a study to assess the viability of operating flights to Cooch Behar. The airport in north Bengal is lying unused for almost a year after an upgrade.        
	We will strengthen our base in Calcutta and start more flights to the Northeast and other destinations, said M. Thiagarajan, the managing director of Paramount Airways who was in the city for the launch.         
	A year back, the Airports Authority of India extended the runway and set up navigational aids at Cooch Behar airport. It is lying unused as private operators feel it is not commercially viable to operate flights to the town.        
	A few days back, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had requested Thiagarajan during a meeting at Writers Buildings to start operations to Cooch Behar.         
	Paramount, which has five small aircraft, plans to buy 15 planes by 2010. The airline operates 72-seater Embraer E170 for business class only flights and Embraer E175, each of which has 11 first-class and 64 business-class seats.        
	Thiagarajan said the airline would launch international operations in a few years with flights to Southeast Asia, West Asia and later to the US and Europe. For this we have to buy wide-bodied aircraft like Boeing and Airbus.        
	Also on the airlines radar are flights from Calcutta to Shillong, Ranchi and Bhubaneswar.

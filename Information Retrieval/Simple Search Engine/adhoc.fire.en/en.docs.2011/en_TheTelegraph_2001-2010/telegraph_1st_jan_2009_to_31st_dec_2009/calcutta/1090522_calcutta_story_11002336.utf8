The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | JU students stinker to firm raises hackles
                                                                                                               JU students stinker to firm raises hackles
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Jadavpur University will be taking disciplinary action against an architecture student for allegedly writing an abusive letter to a company with which he wanted to train this summer.        
	I dont care about your damn organisation, an official quoted the third-year student as saying in the alleged letter to the architecture firm, considered a bulk recruiter of engineering graduates from the university.        
	The firm immediately complained against the student to the authorities in writing and threatened not to entertain any more applications for summer internship.         
	The letter also said the firm felt humiliated and would now think twice before recruiting engineers from the university.         
	The executive council, which is the universitys apex policy-making body, discussed the issue on Wednesday and unanimously decided to penalise the alleged offender for breach of propriety and hampering the job prospects of other students.        
	We were stunned to read the letter that was written by the student to the company. One does not expect a student of a university like ours to use such language when interacting with the authorities of a reputable company, said a member of the council.        
	The council also urged the university to find out exactly what had triggered the students outburst.         
	Vice-chancellor Pradip Narayan Ghosh said the university would summon the student to a hearing soon.        
	We will first seek an explanation from the student. We will decide exactly what action is to be taken against him after hearing what he has to say, said Ghosh.         
	University officials said this was the first time that such a complaint had come from a company against a student.        
	Students nowadays seem to be inclined to cross the line without any provocation, which must be checked. If the authorities do not punish the student who wrote that letter, I suspect similar incidents will recur and the universitys reputation will be tarnished, said a teacher.        
	The university has already barred its students from individually applying for summer internships with any company.        
	From now on, students will be required to apply to various companies for summer training through their respective head of department, an official said.        
	The heads of departments will scan each application before forwarding it to the companies.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Axe attack on grandparents
                                                                                                               Axe attack on grandparents
          A STAFF REPORTER                            Chayanika and Anil Ghosh at SSKM. (Pradip Sanyal)                                 
	A 14-year-old boy, who held his paternal grandparents and aunt responsible for his fathers suicide, attacked the three with a chopper at their Chetla Road home on Monday afternoon.        
	The injured trio were rushed to SSKM Hospital, where Anil Ghosh, 70, and Chayanika, 67, were administered 18 and 41 stitches, respectively. Baisakhi, the 42-year-old-aunt, received 35 stitches.        
	The student of Class VIII of a Hazra school later told the police that he had bought the chopper with money meant to pay his school fee.        
	The teenager, who lives with his mother and younger sister at his maternal grandparents house in Janbazar, has been arrested and charged with attempt to murder.        
	If convicted, he would be sentenced to life imprisonment or 10 years in jail. The accused will be produced in the juvenile court in Salt Lake, said Rajesh Subarno, the deputy commissioner of police (south).         
	The boy, remorseless right through the interrogation, said he wanted to teach a lesson to the trio who he believed had driven his father to suicide. He said he had bought the chopper with money meant to pay his school fees and hidden it in the school bag, said an officer of Alipore police station.        
	The cops learnt that the boys grandparents and aunt Baisakhi, who has been living in the Chetla house since separating from her husband a few years ago, never got along with his mother. The boys parents married in 1991 after courtship.        
	The relationship between the homemaker and her in-laws became so bitter that the boys father, who ran a PCO booth and a fast-food stall, moved to a rented house in Tollygunge with his family in 2004, said a police officer.        
	After he committed suicide on October 5 last year, the mother and the children shifted to Janbazar.        
	The sleuths said the teenager would often visit the Chetla house on his way home from school.        
	On Monday, he came around 11.30am. After lunch, he was watching TV when he suddenly took out the chopper from his schoolbag and lunged at his aunt, said an officer.        
	The boy hit her several times on the head, neck and face. Hearing her cries the grandmother ran in, only to be slashed on her face and right hand.        
	The grandfather, who was taking a bath, rushed out and was hit hard on the head. But the elderly man managed to fight off his grandson.        
	Neighbours, alerted by the sounds, barged into the ground-floor house and overpowered the boy.        
	It was a ghastly sight, Anil and Chayanika Ghosh, and their daughter were standing there, dazed and bleeding, said Asim Saha, a neighbour.        
	Psychologist Moharmala Chatterjee feels children of that age may go through emotional extremes. The anger he felt at his relatives must have been very intense, which made him justify his action.

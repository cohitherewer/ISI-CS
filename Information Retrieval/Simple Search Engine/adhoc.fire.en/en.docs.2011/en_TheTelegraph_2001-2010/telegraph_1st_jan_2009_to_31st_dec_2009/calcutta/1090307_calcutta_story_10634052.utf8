The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | He who steers AshAbhi   Abhis boat ride, Ashs gesture
                                                                                                               He who steers AshAbhi
  - Boatman Boshu gets a gift from him, is charmed by her          MOHUA DAS                          Boshu on the sets of Raavan. (Aranya Sen)                                        
	Boshu the boatman is seeing life through Abhishek Bachchans designer shades these days.        
	When Team Raavan descended on Agarpara last month for Mani Ratnams latest, 32-year-old Boshu was just another boatman who lived with wife Meena in a house overlooking the river and earned a living catching fish and selling scrap.         
	He is now the envy of the neighbourhood after having rubbed shoulders  literally  with Aishwarya Rai Bachchan for a fortnight and Abhishek for a week, ferrying them around from one riverside shooting location to another on his speedboat.        
	Its as good as it gets for the die-hard Nana Patekar fan  he has earned more than he ever has in a month, won the trust of Bollywoods power couple and got a bonus in the form of AB Babys cool grey shades. But more than anything, its Abhisheks easy affection that has bowled Boshu over.        
	The other day, shards of resin (fibreglass glue that he had used to strengthen wobbly parts of the speedboat) flew into my eyes while we were going down the river. Abhishek immediately gave me his sunglasses. I was very surprised. Its a prized possession. Ive kept it safe in my locker, smiles Boshu.        
	Like the rest of the Raavan unit, both Abhishek and Ash call him Basu. And what does the boatman on the Hooghly make of Bollywoods power couple?        
	 Abhishek keeps joking, chatting and patting us on our backs. On the first day of his shoot, he boarded the boat with a bhaar (clay container) of large rosogollas and a box of soft, creamy sweets. He looked at me and my assistant Suraj and wondered if two rosogollas would be enough for our large tummies. He then took out tissue paper from his pocket to give us the sweets, recalls Boshu.                           
	What about Ash?        
	She is definitely the quieter of the two. But when just the three of us (Ash, Boshu and Suraj) were sailing before Abhisheks arrival, Aishwarya would enquire about our daily activities. She was taken aback when we told her about the time we spend on the river. She would order chhaas (buttermilk) for us and make sure we drank it, says the boatman.        
	One of the fun moments with AshAbhi that Boshu wont ever forget is Abhishek replaying a Dhoom:2 scene for his viewing pleasure.        
	He grabbed my cap, put it on his head, took the steering and asked: Mera Dhoom:2 dekha hai na? (You have watched my Dhoom:2, havent you?). He then steered the boat all the way to Dakshineswar.        
	Boshu, who is responsible for arranging any kind of river transport that the unit in Saheb Kuthi might need, earns Rs 10,700 for each day of work. That is inclusive of the charges for labour, three of my personal boats and six other boats hired from Dakshineswar and Babughat, he says.        
	His profit of nearly Rs 37,000 in 16 days is way above the Rs 8,000-10,000 he used to make in a month before the AshAbhi effect.        
	I take up any kind of work that comes my way. I will be on a different assignment after this but Ive never felt so energised before, says Agarparas most famous boatman.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two agents of a nationalised bank have been arrested for allegedly applying force on family members of a Kasba woman in an attempt to make her repay a loan.        
	A neighbour of the woman, Mausumi Roy Chowdhury, has also been arrested on the charge of heckling the agents and some officials of the bank who had turned up at the Kasba house on Wednesday.        
	Finance minister Asim Dasgupta said he had discussed the matter with the chief minister and asked the inspector-general of police (law and order) Surajit Kar Purakayastha to order a probe.        
	The Reserve Bank of India has given specific orders that no borrower can be subjected to torture even if he or she fails to repay a loan in time, Dasgupta said.        
	Roy Chowdhury said she and husband Sambhu, a trader, had taken Rs 4.5 lakh in 2005 as loan to buy a flat. We have paid back a number of instalments but bank officials refused to give us details of the payment whenever we approached them, said Roy Chowdhury.        
	She told the police that some employees and agents of the bank had on Wednesday applied force on her mother and child, alleging that the loan was not being repaid.        
	Neighbours allegedly heckled the team members and drove them away.

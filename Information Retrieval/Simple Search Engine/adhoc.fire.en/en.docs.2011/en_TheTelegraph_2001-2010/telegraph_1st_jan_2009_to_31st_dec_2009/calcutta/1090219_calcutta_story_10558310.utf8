                Kunal Saha, a US-based doctor, moved a writ petition in Calcutta High Court on Wednesday challenging the state medical councils decision to not provide him with details of the probe against three doctors whose alleged negligent treatment resulted in his wife Anuradhas death in 1998. Justice Sanjib Banerjee of the high court admitted the petition and directed the state medical council to file its reply in four weeks, stating why it did not provide the information. The council had given a clean chit to the three doctors in 2005. Saha had also filed a criminal case against the trio. The Alipore district court had sentenced two of the doctors to jail and fined them. The doctors appealed against the judgment in the high court and won the case. Saha moved the apex court against the verdict. The hearing is over and the judgment is expected in a couple of days.

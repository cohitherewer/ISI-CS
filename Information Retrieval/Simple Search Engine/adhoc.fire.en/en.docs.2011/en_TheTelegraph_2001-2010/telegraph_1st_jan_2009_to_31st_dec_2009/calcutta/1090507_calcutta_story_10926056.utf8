The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Contact lens fraud
                                                                                                               Contact lens fraud
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Wednesday rejected anticipatory bail pleas of six sacked employees of Bausch amp; Lomb and another man accused of deliberately selling contact lenses that had passed the sell-by date.        
	According to experts, a contact lens that has crossed the sell-by date loses its oxygen-permeability and can affect the cornea.        
	Y.S. Rawat, the manager (regulatory affair) of the company that produces eye-care products, had lodged an FIR in March against Krishanu Moitra and six others after receiving 93 complaints from dealers about lenses with fake labels.        
	The complaints had shocked the company as it maintains a high standard, said Debasish Roy, who appeared for Bausch amp; Lomb in the high court.        
	The company immediately started a probe and found that some employees had committed the crime. The employees were sacked and a complaint was lodged against them with Park Street police.        
	The division bench of Justice P.K. Chattopadhyay and Justice K. Prasad refused to grant anticipatory bail to the seven accused after public prosecutor Ashimesh Goswami submitted that a probe had revealed that the petitioners were guilty.        
	Eye is the most important organ of the body. The crime which the petitioners had committed could have damaged the eyesight of many people forever. They should not be granted bail, Goswami said.        
	The FIR lodged by Rawat stated that Moitra, who was in charge of the companys business in eastern India, had led the gang in tampering with the labels of contact lenses.        
	The other accused  Abinash Nayek, Rajib Sharma, Ashish Agarwal, Krishna Kumar Sinha and Tirthanu Banerjee  were sales executives who worked under Moitra. The seventh accused is Arun Lathia, who was allegedly involved in the production of fake labels.        
	The complaints sent by the dealers said the sell-by dates written on the labels of the contact lenses did not match what was mentioned on the lenses. The employees removed the labels from the vials of the lenses that had crossed the sell-by date and attached fake labels with new dates, the FIR claimed.

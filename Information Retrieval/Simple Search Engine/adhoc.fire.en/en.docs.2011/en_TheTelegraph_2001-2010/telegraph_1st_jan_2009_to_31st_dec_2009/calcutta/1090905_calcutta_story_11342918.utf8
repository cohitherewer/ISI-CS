The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | City projects in Berlin expo
                                                                                                               City projects in Berlin expo
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Five urban projects conceptualised by Calcutta-based architects and urban designers have been selected to be showcased at an exposition in Berlin later this year.        
	The exhibition  What makes India urban? Challenges towards mobility, infrastructure, energy and perpetual change (October 9 to November 26)  will examine current developments within Indias urbanisation process and the complexity of urban space utilisation.        
	Four of the five Calcutta projects picked for the Berlin exposition being organised by Aedes East  International Forum for Contemporary Architecture are by our member-architects, says Santosh Ghosh, the president of the city-based think tank Centre for Built Environment (CBE).        
	These are Calcutta riverfront: Catalyst for large urban rejuvenation by Partha Ranjan Das; The infrastructure development by Ayan Sen; Urban food production: From waste to wealth by Arunima Guha; and The Park Street rejuvenation project by Monica Khosla Bhargava.        
	Durga Puja pavilions and cultural transformation by Anjan Mitra is the other city initiative to figure on the list of 35 projects selected from across India.        
	Dass riverfront rejuvenation project is based on the theme of bringing the river back to the city. I have tried to highlight the land-use incompatibility, stitching the two riverbanks by stressing accessibility and the need for a vertical hard edge, says Das.        
	Sens project is an effort to showcase infrastructure development in the city over the past three decades. Its difficult to project a positive image of infrastructure in Calcutta. Still I have tried to showcase New Town and Salt Lake, the new flyovers, Metro Railway, slum development and new projects in traffic and transportation, he says.        
	I have tried to highlight the importance of wetlands in our urban planning system, explains Guha. Her project delineates how through age-old indigenous practice, in the wetlands on the periphery of our city, waste water is recycled with photosynthesis which aids fish production. Solid waste is naturally composted and the urban agri-aquaculture is providing food, generating oxygen and creating a blue and green buffer.        
	Bhargavas project is an urban renewal initiative encouraging public participation to restore Park Streets diluting status of the drawing room of the metropolis.        
	Mitra has underlined the magnificence of the Durga puja and how there is a renewed awareness on the preservation of our tangible and intangible cultural heritage.        
	Exposure in such a high-profile global forum is most welcome, says architect and urban designer Das.        
	Sen warns: If all Indian projects are revisited after a decade and its found that Calcutta has made the least headway, it would be a shame.

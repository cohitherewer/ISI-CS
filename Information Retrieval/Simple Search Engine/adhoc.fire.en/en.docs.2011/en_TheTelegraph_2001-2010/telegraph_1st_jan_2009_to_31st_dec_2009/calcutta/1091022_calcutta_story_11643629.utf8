                      Synthesis of form and content                    The works of Shaibal Ghosh are, more than anything else, characterised by authenticity. This is particularly true of his later works that have a directness indicating a full integration of form and structuring with the cries of the deeper levels of the psyche. They do not seek to strike a pose or aspire to be anything they are not. Powerful, yet at ease with themselves, they are lyrical, tragic, beautiful and profound. The ongoing show of small format works by Ghosh features drawings, paintings and sketches that have an embracing mystery about them. There are some exquisite mindscapes: rich in content, allegories and symbols. Some are complex in a structural sense. There is also a great deal of isolation and silence in these works that are brief but eloquent essays on the transience of life. Ghoshs virtuosity is apparent in his strong sense of narrative, dynamic compositions, rich tonality, depth of feeling and hints of abstraction, all of which combine to produce a rare and almost hallucinatory look and feel that is almost graphical in nature. Each work tells a different story and yet they are all linked by the intrinsic qualities and associations of a certain form and structure.                    Event: An exhibition of small format works by Shaibal Ghosh When: Till October 22; 11 am - 7 pm Where: Gallery K2, Supra Court, 35 Lansdowne Terrace

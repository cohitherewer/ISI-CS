                                                                                                               Three Salt Lake houses burgled
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Three houses in a row in Salt Lakes IA Block were burgled early on Sunday.        
	Police said the gang  comprising three men, according to a witness  took away goods worth more than Rs 2 lakh from houses 213, 214 and 215 between 1.30 and 3.30am.        
	The burglars took away a few metal taps and pipes from the lawn of 213 and a few shoes and clothes from 214.        
	From the third house, they stole snickers, sunglasses, watches, branded shirts and two cellphones, said an officer of Bidhannagar South police station. The gang entered 214 and 215 after breaking the padlocks and cutting the iron grilles.        
	At 214, where a doctor lives with his family, the gang broke into a ground-floor dispensary but found only a few shoes and clothes.        
	Sajjan Agarwal, who lives at 215, said the burglars had taken away whatever they could lay their hands on, including a number of silver idols of gods and goddesses from a shrine on the ground floor. They ransacked all the rooms on the ground floor and took away snickers, sunglasses, watches, shirts and two cellphones, including one belonging to my daughter, said Agarwal, a businessman.        
	Agarwals daughter Richa woke up as a member of the gang tried to snatch her chain. I woke up and raised an alarm. The man in his mid-30s pushed me back and fled along with two others, said the 28-year-old.        
	According to the Agarwals complaint, one of the burglars called them from Richas cellphone around 6pm and threatened them not to inform the cops or else they would strike again.        
	The caller said he would return the silver idols against a payment but we refused, said Agarwal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Flat owners win damages from realty firm
                                                                                                               Flat owners win damages from realty firm
          SANJAY MANDAL                              
	The state consumer court has ordered a leading real estate company to pay Rs 7.5 lakh to 15 flat owners in one of its estates for not providing features promised during sale.        
	The flat owners had alleged that Bengal Shrachi Housing Development Ltd, a joint venture of the state housing board and the Shrachi group, did not provide parking space, community halls and other facilities in Greenwood Nook, off the EM Bypass, near the Prince Anwar Shah Road connector.        
	The State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission recently passed the verdict.         
	Rahul Todi, the managing director of Bengal Shrachi, said: We are not satisfied with the state commissions verdict and will move the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission soon.        
	The 15 had booked flats in the estate in 2003 after seeing advertisements published by Bengal Shrachi. They were handed over the flats in May 2006. Soon after getting possession, we noticed that several of the advertised features were absent, alleged Sumit Banerjee, the owner of an MIG flat at Greenwood Nook and one of the complainants.        
	The company had promised covered space for 13 cars for the MIG flat owners. Some of us had applied for covered parking spaces but when we approached the authorities, we were told that the facility was not available, said Banerjee.        
	According to him, an applicant had paid Rs 1 lakh for a covered parking space.        
	The complainants had engaged a chartered engineer, who stated in his report that covered parking space was not made available to the petitioners despite their applications.         
	On reading the provisions of the general terms and conditions it appears that it is the responsibility of the opposite party (Bengal Shrachi) to make an offer of unallotted car parking spaces when found available and on such offers the flat owners were entitled to make applications on which the opposite party was to make allotments, Aloke Chakrabarti, the president of the commission observed in his order.         
	No such endeavour was made by the opposite party making an offer or declaration about availability of unallotted car parking spaces, which could have been applied for by the flat owners, Chakrabarti stated.        
	The commission in its order asked Bengal Shrachi to pay Rs 50,000 each to the 15 complainants. It also asked the company to provide authentic photocopies of the completion certificate and execute the registration of deeds within two months.         
	More than a third of the 1,100-odd cases pending with consumer court pertain to real estate, said an official of the commission. Most of the appeals are by consumers duped by realtors, said Prabir Basu, a member of the State Consumer Protection Council.

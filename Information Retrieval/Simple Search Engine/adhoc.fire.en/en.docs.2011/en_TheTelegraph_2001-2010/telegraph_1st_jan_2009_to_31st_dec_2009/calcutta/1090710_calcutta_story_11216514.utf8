                                                                                                               BMW eyes 100 
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The BMW X6 in the city. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                  
	BMW on Thursday brought to the city the worlds first Sports Activity Coupe, the BMW X6 (xDrive 50i) that will pinch the pocket by Rs 82.9 lakh (ex- showroom, Calcutta).         
	While premium car makers are stumbling at the recession roadblock  a Honda showroom in the city shut shop recently and Audis handpicked dealer opted out earlier this year  the German auto giant is zooming ahead. In 2008, BMW sold 70 units in town and aims to cross the 100-mark this year, said Peter Kronschnabl, the president of BMW India Pvt Ltd.         
	Its German rival, Mercedes, sold 82 cars in the city in 2008 and 43 this year.         
	Having sold 10 units of the X series in Calcutta, including the X3 and X5, in 2008-09, OSL Prestige, BMWs sole dealership in the city, is optimistic about the X6 market. There are discernible customers here who know their BMW models and are willing to shell out the money, said Charchit Mishra, the managing director of OSL Prestige.        
	The X6, launched this January at the Detroit Auto Show, will be available in the city in two variants, the petrol xDrive 50i and the diesel xDrive 30d, priced at Rs 65.9 lakh.

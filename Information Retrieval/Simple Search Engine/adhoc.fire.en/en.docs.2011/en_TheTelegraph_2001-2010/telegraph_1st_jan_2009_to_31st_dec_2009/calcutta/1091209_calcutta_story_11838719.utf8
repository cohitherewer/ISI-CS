The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Vedic accused gets bail
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Vedic accused gets bail
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Tuesday granted bail to Biplab Biswas, the project manager of Vedic Village who was arrested in August on charges of murder, forgery and illegal possession of arms.        
	The court, however, refused bail to Gaffar Mollah, a key accused in the Vedic Village arson and land grab cases.        
	The division bench of Justice P.C. Ghosh and Justice S.P. Talukdar also granted bail to three other accused  Abdul Hai, Laxman Ghosh and Ranjeet Shee.        
	Raj K. Modi, an owner of the luxury resort in Rajarhat, was granted bail in November in the last two of the 14 cases slapped on him.        
	Modi, Biplab, Gaffar and others were arrested in August and September on charges of killing Amarul Sardar, a villager, on August 22 during a football match, forgery, grabbing land in the vicinity of Vedic Village and storing arms on the resort premises.        
	A mob of local villagers stormed the resort in search of Sardars killers and set it on fire.        
	In forgery and arms cases, both Biplab and Gaffar got bail in the high court last week. The duos bail plea in the murder case came up for hearing on Tuesday.        
	Joymalya Bagchi, who appeared for Biplab, submitted before the court that the investigating officers had failed to prove that his client was involved in the crime. Nearly four months have passed but the sleuths are yet to produce any evidence linking my client to the murder.        
	As project manager of Vedic Village, Biplab acted on orders from the owners of the property. One of the owners, Raj K. Modi, has been granted bail. There is no reason why my client should still remain behind bars, Bagchi submitted.        
	Public prosecutor Ashimesh Goswami opposed the bail pleas, especially the one moved by Gaffar.        
	He is a criminal and main accused in the case. One of the co-accused, Khudey, is still absconding. The investigation will suffer if Gaffar comes out on bail, Goswami said.

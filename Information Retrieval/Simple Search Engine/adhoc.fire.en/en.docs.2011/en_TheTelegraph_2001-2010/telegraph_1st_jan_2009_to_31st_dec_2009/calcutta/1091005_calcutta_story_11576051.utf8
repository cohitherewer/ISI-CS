The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Car kills woman at zebra crossing
                                                                                                               Car kills woman at zebra crossing
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The spot on the Park Circus connector where a car hit a woman. (Aranya Sen)                                  
	A middle-aged woman walking through a zebra crossing on the Park Circus connector was killed by a speeding sedan that jumped a traffic signal, knocked her down and ran her over in the drivers desperation to flee.        
	The bleeding woman was taken to National Medical College and Hospital, where she died within 10 minutes of being wheeled in. Police later said the victims name was Johuri Bibi but no other details were available.        
	The Honda City involved in the incident, which occurred near the Steel Junction crossing, was identified as WB-02K 4885 but hadnt been traced till late on Sunday.        
	Witnesses said the car was speeding towards the EM Bypass when the traffic light turned red. The driver slammed the brakes after crossing the signal, causing the car to skid and hit the woman at the zebra crossing.        
	She was flung away on impact but came under the car as the driver tried to speed away. When the victim got entangled in the undercarriage of the vehicle, the car went back a few feet before the driver revved up and zoomed off, leaving the victim lying on the road in a pool of blood, said Rajen Sahu, who owns a paan shop near the accident site.        
	A police officer said the victim might have survived had the driver stopped immediately after knocking her down. Going by what witnesses told us, she was probably not fatally injured at first. But then the car went over the woman, he added.        
	Only 1,000 traffic personnel are deployed in the city on Sundays, against around 5,000 on weekdays.         
	According to residents of Park Circus and its neighbouring areas, speeding is common near the accident site, especially on holidays when traffic is thin and policing almost non-existent.        
	The crossing where the woman was killed is most dangerous because vehicles coming from Mateswar Road take a left turn towards Science City at high speed. The car involved in the accident could have been easily intercepted had a sergeant been on duty at the spot on Sunday, said Md. Salim, a resident of Topsia.        
	In another incident around 12.30pm on Sunday, a 58-year-old man fell while trying to get off a moving bus and was crushed under its wheels on AJC Bose Road.         
	Malay Mitra, a resident of Lake Gardens, was standing on the footboard of a Calcutta-Barasat bus and trying to get off in front of Calcutta Club  near the Exide crossing  when the accident occurred.         
	He was taken to SSKM Hospital, where he underwent surgery but died in the evening. The police impounded the bus but the driver fled.

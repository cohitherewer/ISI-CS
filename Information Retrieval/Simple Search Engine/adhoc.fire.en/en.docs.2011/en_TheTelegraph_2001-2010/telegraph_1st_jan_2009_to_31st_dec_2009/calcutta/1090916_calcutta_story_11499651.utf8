The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Red rally batters driver
                                                                                                               Red rally batters driver
          OUR BUREAU                                          Mohammed Miraj. (Pabitra Das)		    
	Some DYFI supporters, marching to their rally at Esplanade, beat up a 21-year-old lorry driver for daring to speed past them on the Taratala flyover on Tuesday afternoon.        
	Mohammed Miraj suffered gaping wounds on the head but police advised him to leave the spot immediately and they later filed a general diary recording the incident as a heated altercation.        
	The resident of Shibpur, accompanied by his help Mohammad Raju, was driving down from Falta when he spotted the procession by the CPMs youth wing on the Taratala flyover around 1pm.        
	Since the rallyists were walking down the left flank, I took the right. I pressed the accelerator as there was no vehicle ahead of me. Suddenly I heard the marchers screaming, pointing fingers at us. A couple of seconds later a bike screeched to a halt in front of me, forcing me to stop, Miraj told Metro later on Tuesday.        
	A mob then dragged Miraj and Raju out of their cabin, abusing them for their audacity to speed past the rally. The party activists started raining blows on me. Some even hit me on the head with flag poles, Miraj said.        
	When cops from New Alipore police station, alerted by witnesses, arrived on the spot, Miraj was bleeding profusely. Sub-inspector M.L. Biswas allegedly asked Miraj to leave the spot immediately and advised him to consult a doctor. He then returned to the police station and lodged a general diary which described the assault as a heated altercation.        
	A duty officer at the police station said: This was nothing major. We have not named anyone in our record.        
	Police sources said Biswas should have taken Miraj to hospital and got a medical certificate issued before filing an FIR detailing the assault.        
	Miraj went to a hospital on his own and got his wounds stitched.        
	I didnt hear anything about the incident, claimed DYFI state secretary Avash Roychowdhury.         
	If the rally in the Metro channel left Mir bleeding from the head, it choked the heart of the city for the entire afternoon, with snarls on Chowringhee, SN Banerjee Road, Lenin Sarani, CR Avenue, Old Court House Street and Red Road.        
	Some DYFI leaders accused the police of trying to stop their marches in various parts of the city on the pretext of maintaining law and order. The state unit chief Pratim Ghosh said: I urged our members to defy all obstacles.

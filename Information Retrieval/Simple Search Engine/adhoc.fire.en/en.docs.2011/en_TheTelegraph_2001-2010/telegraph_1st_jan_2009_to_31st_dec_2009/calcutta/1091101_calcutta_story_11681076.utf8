The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | City absent in art mag
                                                                                                               City absent in art mag
										      eyewitness                        The quarterly Marg magazine in its new avatar                                
	Marg is back with a new look and content and looks as good as it reads. Mulk Raj Anand had launched the magazine 63 years ago. Its general editor, Pratapaditya Pal, writes: With its focus on grids of art and cultural tradition, the magazine reflects new trends, new research, and new scholarship. In keeping with this agenda, the theme is early photography of India, which, lest we forget, is a young medium without even a muse. The guest editor is Rahaab Allana.        
	The reproduction of the period photographs is flawless. The articles on royal patronage of photography, its close links with painting, the medium as a tool for documentation, and other analytical essays on it are arresting.        
	At the same time, the neglect of Calcutta, that was one of photographys birthplaces in India, is quite astounding. Calcutta is only referred to in passing as the studios of both Johnston Hoffman and Bourne amp; Shepherd were located here, and collections featured here were their work.        
	It did not take very long for natives in Calcutta to familiarise themselves with the techniques and ultimately the aesthetics of this new medium. Even Bengali women had opened their very own zenana studios. There is no acknowledgment of the pioneering work done in this city. If this is merely an oversight, it is too grave a solecism to be explained away easily.              
	Bose Pacias current exhibition titled Re-Claim/Re-Cite/Re-Cycle is a glossy, brassy show, quite as loud  literally and metaphorically  as the costumes that protagonists flaunt in Hindi serials. The blast  it sounds as if a brass band from MG Road is jamming with an explosively flatulent elephant  that greets visitors is quite unnerving. One discovers that the din is emanating from Chittrovanu Mazumdars ice cream factory. But in todays shock-proof world, it manages to be just a minor irritant.         
	Curated by Bhavna Kakar, these new India artists look with amazement at a long queue of poor people collecting water from a single spout, and make much of hand-made matchboxes and soft drink crowns hand-picked from Amsterdam bars. Sharmila Samants sari installation made of these crowns is a novel idea, but can one dub their collection a performative process? This is art processed by market forces.         
	Manjunath Kamath recycles classics to such a tiresome degree that one recoils at the cleverness of it all. Even the concept of magnifying Mona Lisas eye and substituting the pixels with a slogan has been done to death.         
	The paintings and drawings fare better. This has nothing to do with tech. It is just a question of imagination and the lack of it. Rajan M. Krishnans recycled memories bloom into a stainless steel forest much like a coral reef. Tushar Joags drawings of recycled buildings are somewhere between the phantasmagoric and the satiric.        
	Bhagyanath conjures up multi-level structures where the humans have mutated into nightmare beings. Prajakta Potnis cannot take her eyes off the ooze and mould on the wall of a room affected by rising damp. Most of Bhavna Kakars artists look at India with eyes of outsiders.       SD

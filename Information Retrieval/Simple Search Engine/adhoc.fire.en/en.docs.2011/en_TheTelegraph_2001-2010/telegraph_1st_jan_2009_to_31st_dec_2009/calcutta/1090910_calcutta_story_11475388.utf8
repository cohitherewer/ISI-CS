The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 7-day cop remand for goon
                                                                                                               7-day cop remand for goon
  - Gaffar waves at crowd, Modi moves bail pleas in high court          OUR BUREAU                                    
	Gaffar Mollah and five others who were arrested in Bankura early on Tuesday in connection with the Vedic Village flare-up were remanded in police custody for seven days.        
	Also during the day, Vedic Village owner Raj Kishore Modi, accused of harbouring Gaffar and his gang to grab land for his projects, moved three bail pleas in the high court against three FIRs lodged against him.        
	The petitions filed by the realtor, in police custody since his arrest on August 29, state that he is a cardiac patient in need of immediate treatment. Sources said the pleas would be heard on Thursday.        
	At the Barasat chief judicial magistrates court, Gaffar and his men were charged under Section 25/35 of the arms act and IPC sections 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder), 467 (forgery for valuable security) and 149 (unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), apart from a host of bailable sections.        
	Dressed in dark trousers and a striped T-shirt, Gaffar looked composed in the court room and occasionally waved at the members of the audience, many of whom jostled with the police for a closer look.        
	Public prosecutor Bikash Ranjan Dey pleaded for 10 days police custody for the accused, saying the cops were yet to unearth the entire illegal network of the gang. Sleuths still do not know about all the hideouts where Gaffar had stashed his arms, Dey submitted.        
	Defence lawyers opposed the submission on the ground that the police had already informed the court in another case related to the Vedic Village arson that all arms of the accused had been seized.        
	The magistrate, however, rejected the defence plea and sent the accused to a weeks police custody.        
	Around 500 Congress activists were demonstrating in the compound of the Barasat court while Gaffar and his associates were being brought in, demanding that the police reveal the names of CPM leaders with whom the accused had links.        
	A group of Trinamul Congress supporters raised the same demand while the accused were being led out. Some activists threw eggs at the police van carrying Gaffar and his gang.        
	At Writers Buildings, home secretary Ardhendu Sen said the police were looking for specific complaints against Gaffar. We are looking at three angles  the death (during a football match near Vedic Village), the arson at the resort and alleged gunpoint acquisition of land by Gaffar and his men. If anybody complains about forceful acquisition, he/she will have to provide the khatian and dag numbers of the plot, Sen said.

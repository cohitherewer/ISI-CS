                                                                                                               Bullet for not giving up bike

	A young insurance executive was shot in the abdomen at point-blank range off VIP Road early on Friday for resisting an armed gang that demanded his motorcycle.        
	Abir Neogi, 28, is recuperating in a private hospital on the EM Bypass after undergoing surgery to extract the bullet from his left kidney.        
	The Jadavpur resident was returning home from a friends house in Baguiati, around 2am, when he was waylaid by four men who got off a car that had screeched to a halt seconds earlier.         
	They asked me to hand over the motorcycle key but I refused, Abir told Metro a few hours after surgery at Ruby General Hospital. One of them then brought out a gun and held it to my forehead. He threatened to kill me if I did not give him the key.         
	Abir said he was scared on seeing the gun but still mustered the courage to push it away from his face. Another gang member immediately pulled out a countrymade gun from under his belt and shot him in the abdomen.        
	I was too stunned to react. I realised that I had been shot only on putting my hand on my stomach and seeing blood ooze out of the wound, he recounted.        
	As Abir slumped to the ground, two members of the gang fled with his motorcycle. Their accomplices got into the car and sped off in the same direction.         
	Struggling to remain conscious, Abir dragged himself to VIP Road and screamed for help but the vehicles passing by wouldnt stop.        
	I feared that I would bleed to death. Fortunately, I didnt become unconscious, he said.         
	Just when he was giving up hope of reaching the nearest hospital, a car stopped and the driver took him to Ruby General Hospital.        
	Abir called his father Ashish Neogi, a senior official of a public sector bank in the city, from his cellphone after reaching the hospital.        
	A CT scan revealed that the bullet was lodged in his left kidney. The bullet caused multiple abdominal injuries and even caused a crack in one of his vertebrae before piercing the kidney, said Kalyan Kar, who performed a three-hour surgery to take out the bullet.        
	It was a close shave for him. Luckily, the bullet grazed past the abdominal aorta, the main blood vessel in the body. Had it pierced the vessel, he probably wouldnt have survived, Kar added.         
	Late on Friday, he described Abirs condition as critical but stable.        
	My son has returned from the jaws of death, said the youths father.        
	The hospital authorities lodged an FIR with Tiljala police station, which later contacted Baguiati police station.         
	Our Baguiati counterparts are investigating the incident, said Sekhar Bose, the officer-in-charge of Tiljala police station.

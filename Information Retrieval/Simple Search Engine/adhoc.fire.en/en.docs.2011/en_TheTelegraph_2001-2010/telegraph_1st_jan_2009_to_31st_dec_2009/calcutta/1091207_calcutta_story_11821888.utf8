The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fume fight in reverse gear
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Fume fight in reverse gear

	Transport minister Ranjit Kundu has gone back on his threat to act against the owners of old, polluting buses who are yet to apply for replacements.        
	Buses more than 15 years old have been banned by the high court and the government had set October 31 as the deadline for applications for their replacement with new vehicles.        
	On November 19, Kundu had asserted that the government would cancel the permits of around 1,000 banned buses as their owners had failed to meet the deadline.        
	When Metro reminded him on December 4 of his promise, the minister said: There will not be any cancellation...        
	The transport department had issued showcause notices on November 5 to the 1,200-odd bus operators  of the 3,067 under the purview of the ban  who missed the October 31 deadline. The operators were given a fortnight to reply.        
	Officials said only around 200 owners had cited valid reasons for not being able to apply for replacement by October 31. They have been allowed to apply after the deadline. As for the rest, the minister had threatened to cancel their permits, said an official.        
	Operators said whoever had not applied for replacement by now would not do so in future. There is no politics at play here. Its simple economics. After the ban came into force, necessitating the replacement of old vehicles, the business isnt as lucrative, said Trinamul MLA Swarnakamal Saha, a senior leader of the transport lobby.        
	Green activists are not taken aback by the governments stand. When it comes to enforcing the court ban on polluting vehicles, the governments strategy has been one step forward-two steps back, said environment activist Subhash Dutta.        
	A transport department official, however, argued that cancelling permits could not be a solution as the city desperately needed buses.        
	To make up for the shortfall in the number of buses, minister Kundu said, the government would treat the number of defaulters as the number of vacancies and applications for new permits would be invited. But when will the process of filling up the vacancies begin?        
	There is little my department can do. Its up to the PVD and the RTA to invite applications, Kundu added.        
	Government sources punched holes in the ministers claim, pointing out that both PVD and RTA, though autonomous, functioned under his department.

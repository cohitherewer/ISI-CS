The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Court demands rule rein on road-hog pandals
                                                                                                               Court demands rule rein on road-hog pandals
  - Bench tells govt to fix deadline for puja organisers to seek permission before construction          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                                                  
	The state government should set a deadline for pujas seeking permission to erect pandals on roads and ensure that the rule book is followed, the high court said on Wednesday.        
	There should be a deadline for seeking permission for setting up pandals blocking roads. Now, some organisers start erecting pandals on roads more than two months before the Puja without seeking consent from the civic authorities, fire department, power supply agencies and police. Why should it not be mandatory for puja committees to obtain permission before starting work on pandals? Justice Sanjib Banerjee observed.        
	The judge made the comment while hearing a case related to Kasba RK Chatterjee Road Adhibasi Brinda Durgotsav Committee, which has been dragged to court by a resident of the area for setting up a pandal blocking a road. The judge was surprised to know that the club had started work on the pandal before applying for the mandatory clearances.        
	Biswarup Bhattacharya, appearing for the club, submitted that there was no deadline for seeking consent. The norm is to apply for permission before the Puja. And that is given only for the four days of the festival. There is no rule that work on pandals cannot be started before clearances are issued.        
	The fire services department has refused clearance to the Kasba club following a spot inspection on Sunday. Bhattacharya admitted before the judge that his client had erred by violating fire-safety norms. But hundreds of pujas are being organised violating norms. We will try our best to leave as much space open as possible but there is no way we can hold the puja if the norms are strictly enforced, the puja committees lawyer pleaded.        
	The judge then directed the organisers back to the fire department. The court cannot go beyond the rule. I can give you three more days to make another representation before the fire department. Only the director of the fire service can take a decision, the judge said, posting the matter for hearing on September 4.        
	According to the fire departments norm, pandals coming up on roads up to 15 feet wide have to leave at least 4 feet open. For pandals on roads up to 20 and 30 feet wide, six and 10 feet have to be left open, respectively. For roads wider than 30 feet, organisers have to leave at least 20 feet.        
	The department also has a seven-point guideline, which includes easy access to pandals for fire engines and separate gates (each at least 14 feet high and 12 feet wide) for entry and exit.        
	A high court division bench had in 2005 ruled that if various government agencies and departments came up with conflicting norms, the ones issued by the fire department would prevail.

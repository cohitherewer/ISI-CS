The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Next weekend you can be at ... Jamuna Dighi 
                                                                                                               Next weekend you can be at ... Jamuna Dighi 
                                                
	Jamuna Dighi in Burdwan district is 7km from Mankar station on the Howrah-Asansol section of Eastern Railway and 13km from Paraj on Durgapur Expressway near Panagarh. It offers the perfect destination for a quiet weekend.         
	Green paddy fields on either side of the road, and the abundance of sirish, mango, jackfruit and sishu trees provide a welcome change from the city scenery.         
	A sprawling 25 hectares in Jamuna Dighi is used for pisciculture under the State Fisheries Development Corporation. Thirty-nine ponds, each spread over 22-25 bighas have been dug for the purpose. Big fishes like rui, katla and mrigel are cultivated here. The fisheries department also maintains a garden here.         
	A part of the area has been turned into a tourist spot. Former office buildings have been transformed into rest houses, with modern facilities. Amrapali Tourist Complex offers good accommodation. Boating facilities make the stay special.         
	Seven km from Jamuna Dighi lies Valki forest. The huge forest, which begins at Jamuna Dighi, crosses Bengal and enters Jharkhand. It gets thicker on its way to Panagarh and was once infested with bears.         
	The forest has a story. Nearly 300 years ago a wise king lived in the area. Once he and his queen, who was pregnant, were travelling through the forest when the two got separated from each other. Days passed and the queen gave birth to a boy. But she did not survive and the child was saved by bears.                   
	The king, still searching for his queen, heard a childs cries in the forest. He realised that the child was his and brought him back to the palace. When this child became king he had three daughters  Jamuna, Sweta and Kalindi. Jamuna Dighi was named after the eldest daughter.         
	While walking through the forest, one can see the sunlight playing on the dense foliage. One has to be cautious about the monkeys, though. Wildcats can also be seen. The sun setting behind tall trees is an enchanting experience and the silence is punctuated by the calls of elephants from the Dalma forest.         
	Going         
	Take a train from Howrah station, preferably Black Diamond, and get down at Mankar station. One has to reach Jamuna Dighi by road. Or take a bus via the Durgapur Expressway and get off at Paraj More. Buses and other transport to Jamuna Dighi are available from here.              
	Staying        
	The state fisheries department rest house is an option. Contact Bikash Bhavan, Salt Lake, for booking.

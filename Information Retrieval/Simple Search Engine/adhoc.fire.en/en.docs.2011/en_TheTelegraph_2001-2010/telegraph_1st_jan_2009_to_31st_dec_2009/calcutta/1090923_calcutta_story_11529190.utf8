                                                                                                               Varsity expels ragging three
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jadavpur University has expelled three students for ragging and barred them from seeking admission in any other institution for a year, making this the strongest penalty for any offence in its 53-year history.        
	The universitys executive council took the decision on Tuesday after several days of debating the anti-ragging committees recommendation to expel the engineering students for ragging five freshers.        
	The council, which is the universitys highest policy-making body, also upheld the anti-ragging committees suggestion to suspend one student for four semesters  or two years  and expel him from the hostel. As recommended by the panel, another student was expelled from the hostel for the same offence.        
	The university has never before taken such a drastic step. On many occasions, students have been suspended for various offences, including ragging, but this is the first time that someone has been expelled for ragging or any other offence, said pro vice-chancellor Siddhartha Dutta.        
	Five first-year students of engineering had lodged a complaint with the universitys anti-ragging squad on September 4, accusing six seniors of subjecting them to physical and mental abuse in the Block A-1 hostel.        
	A committee set up to probe the incident submitted its report to vice-chancellor P.N. Ghosh last week.        
	The panel suggested that three of the culprits be expelled and barred from taking admission in any other institution for a certain period of time. The report left it to the executive council to decide how long the students should be barred from seeking admission in any other institution.        
	While it endorsed all the recommendations, the executive council decided to institute a separate inquiry into the ragging victims flip-flop two days after lodging a complaint against six seniors.         
	The freshers had stunned everyone by claiming that the dean of students had forced them to sign a false complaint against their seniors.         
	 A section of council members demanded an inquiry to find out what had prompted the five first-year students to change their mind and lodge a complaint against the dean, said a council member.        
	Pro vice-chancellor Dutta said the university would take a decision on how to go about the inquiry after the Puja holidays.

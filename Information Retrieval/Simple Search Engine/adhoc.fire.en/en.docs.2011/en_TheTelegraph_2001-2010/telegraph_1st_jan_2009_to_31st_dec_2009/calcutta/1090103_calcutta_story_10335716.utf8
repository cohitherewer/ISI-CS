The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Taxis mind auto gap
                                                                                                               Taxis mind auto gap
  - Switch from three to four-wheel shuttle          A STAFF REPORTER                          Commuters get into a shuttle taxi at Taratala on Friday. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya   (Below) An autorickshaw plies on the Park Circus connector on Friday with a poster on its side stating that two-stroke three-wheelers converted to LPG can meet the Bharat Stage II emission norms. The high court, however, has banned all two-stroke autos. (Amit Datta)                                                      
	Day Two of the two-stroke ban gave Calcutta autos with a difference. They were yellow with single blue stripes on the sides and had four doors and four wheels.        
	Sounds familiar? You got it right. Taxis switched to the auto mode and offered shuttle services across the city. Many were forced to hop on to the cabs with buses overcrowded and other transportation options largely limited to the trickle of four-stroke and LPG autos.        
	We have been running shuttle services all day. The charge is Rs 10 per head and I can take up to six passengers on each trip, said Sailesh Yadav, whose taxi plied between Taratala and Mahestala.        
	For the shuttle taxi ride I am shelling out twice the auto fare, but with the problem weve been facing since yesterday, is there a choice? asked 21-year-old Mukto Ghosh.         
	The drivers of the shuttle taxis werent complaining. I have been charging Rs 10 for a ride from Rashbehari to Gariahat. With five passengers per trip, its very profitable. I made over Rs 2,200 between 2pm and 7pm. Auto drivers hopefully wont cause a problem, Rafiq Umar, a taxi driver from south Calcutta told Metro.        
	Some commuters were quite happy to be able to avail themselves of the service. I was pleasantly surprised when I got off the Metro at Kalighat and walked out to find shuttle taxis. Shelling out a little extra doesnt hurt in times of crisis, said Dolly Deb, 36, a theatre actress on her way to rehearsal.        
	The taxi operators unions promised action against cabs offering shuttle service.        
	Some taxi drivers are trying to cash in on peoples problems. This is illegal and unethical. The unions are meeting on Monday to find a way to combat this, said Tarak Nath Barik, the secretary of Calcutta Taxi Association. Bimal Guha, the general secretary of the Bengal Taxi Association, echoed him.        
	At many places auto drivers added to the commuters woes and forced them to take shuttle taxis.         
	Nearly 100 three-wheeler drivers on the Sinthee-Kamarhati route wielded sticks and clubs to not allow buses to stop at stands.

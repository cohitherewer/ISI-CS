The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pandal norms from next year: police
                                                                                                               Pandal norms from next year: police
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Police have expressed their inability to enforce the high court-approved Puja norms this year but promised to be strict from 2010.        
	With only two days to go for Puja, an officer said: There is not enough time to get the organisers modify the pandals in compliance with the rules.        
	Next year, the officer added, the puja committees will be briefed about the rules well in advance and regular checks will be conducted to ensure they are honoured.        
	The police have found during inspections that more than 60 per cent of the 1,125 pujas in the city had violated one or more guidelines.        
	Firemen, who joined the inspections, found violations in several pandals and even lodged an FIR against Shib Mandir Sarbajonin Durgotsab for not leaving four feet free on all four sides of the pandal and using inflammable materials in the structure.        
	Several committees that were at fault pleaded that they had not violated the guidelines deliberately. The pandals were almost complete when the high court issued the ruling. The pandals that have breached the height norm of 40 feet cannot be trimmed in such a short period, said a police officer.        
	The norms, however, have been in place for years. The only addition is the requirement to keep four feet free on all sides of the pandals.        
	On Tuesday, the cops slapped a case on Campbagan puja committee in Chitpur following the arrest of two of its members on the charge of forcible collection of puja subscriptions.        
	We have asked the civic body to cancel the permission of the puja. Once the permission is withdrawn, the pandal becomes an illegal structure. Well then slap a case on the organisers, said the joint commissioner of police (headquarters), Jawed Shamim.        
	More than 15,000 cops would be on streets on Wednesday to keep vigil on revellers. From Sashthi, the strength will be increased to 25,000. Cops, armed with night-vision binoculars, will also be stationed atop 37 towers across the city.

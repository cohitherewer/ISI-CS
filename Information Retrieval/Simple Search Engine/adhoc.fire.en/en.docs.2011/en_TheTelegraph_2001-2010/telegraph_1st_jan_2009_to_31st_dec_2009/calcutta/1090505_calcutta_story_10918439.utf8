                      Reverberating music when voices die                    Among the contemporary Indian authors writing in English, Amit Chaudhuri is definitely very popular despite his limited number of novels (The Immortals, being his fifth in a decade). He arrived on the literary scene with a bang with his very first book, A Strange and Sublime Address, which won the first prize in the Betty Trask Awards, the Commonwealth writers prize for Best First Book in 1992. His Afternoon Raag won the 1993 Southern Arts Literature Prize and the Encore Award for best second novel. His fifth novel, The Immortals (just published to immense critical acclaim in the UK) has been lapped up by readers there. In fact, Eileen Battersby recently wrote in the Irish Times: Even in the context of contemporary Indian writing in English, much of which is outstanding, Chaudhuri is the best. His fifth novel, The Immortals, shows that his fiction, which draws on themes of family and time, is as real as it is beautiful. Written in haunting, melodic prose, The Immortals tells the story  or stories  of Shyam, Mallika and Nirmalya; their relationships, their lives, their music. More than that, though, it is the story of music as art, and an exploration of its place in the modern world of money and commerce. Published by Picador, the book will be formally released by eminent poet Utpal Kumar Basu. Sujata Sen, director of British Council (East India) will do the introductions while Swapan Chakravorty will conduct an interactive session with the author. Hosted by Starmark in association with British Council.                    lEvent: Release of Amit Chaudhuris book, The Immortals lWhen: Today at 7 pm lWhere: Starmark, City South Mall

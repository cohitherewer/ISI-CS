	A 65-year-old businessman died after falling from the fourth-floor window of his office in Posta on Wednesday morning, with police claiming suicide but family members calling it an accident.         
	Police said Hiralal Daga, who ran a trading business and an automobile showroom, had been suffering from depression for the past few months.         
	Prima facie it seems to be suicide driven by depression. We have started an unnatural death case and are waiting for the post-mortem report. The family members have informed us in writing that they were not suspecting any foul play, said an officer of Jorabagan police station.         
	A police team searched the five-storeyed Daga Palace on KK Tagore Street, where the mishap occurred, but failed to find any suicide note.         
	Dagas younger son Abhishek denied his father had been depressed and claimed that the fatal fall had been an accident.         
	My father somehow fell from the fourth-floor window. He looked happy when I met him in the morning before he left for office. There was no reason for him to be depressed. We dont suspect any foul play either, Abhishek told Metro.         
	Daga lived with his wife and two sons in Daga Palace till 1999, when the family shifted to Alipore.        
	Employees of Dagas trading firm that operated from the building said he had been alone in the office around the time he fell from the window. Hearing a loud thud around 11.10am, some tenants of the building rushed to the first-floor terrace where Daga was found lying unconscious, bleeding from the mouth and nose.         
	He was rushed to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital where he was declared dead on arrival.         
	The cops spoke to Dagas younger brother and his family members who live on the first floor of the building.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Unofficial invasion is on
                                                                                                               Unofficial invasion is on

	The Election Commissions invasion of National Library continued on Thursday, but theres nothing official about it yet.        
	Truckloads of bamboo poles were dumped during the day on the sprawling ground in front of the old reading room, though the panel is yet to inform the library authorities about its final decision on using the seat of learning for poll purposes.        
	They had informed us that chief electoral officer Debashis Sen would decide on the issue by April 27 but we are yet to hear from the panel, said a library official.        
	Sen had told Metro on Wednesday that because of the first phase of polling in Bengal on April 30, a decision on the National Library would be taken either on May 1 or 2.        
	But the invasion of the Alipore campus has been on, one unofficial step at a time, from Tuesday, starting with a clean-up and followed by the dumping of poll paraphernalia in the form of tables, chairs and now bamboo poles.        
	These will be used to set up a tent, said one of the five labourers unloading the poles from a Matador on Thursday afternoon.        
	A few workers from a decorator company took over the mezzanine floor of the old reading room and earmarked places to be used for the setting up of counting centres.        
	Plywood sheets were brought in and workers were busy setting up enclosures spread across 2,000 sq ft.        
	We have been asked to finish work within four to five days, said another worker engaged in piling up chairs and tables in the hall.        
	Library director K.K. Banerjee said readers were his first priority and he would ensure that they were not inconvenienced. Let us wait for the commissions decision, he said.        
	Fearing a rerun of the 2006 Assembly polls when the election brigade took over the grounds, inconveniencing readers and library officials, the general secretary of the National Library Staff Association, Saibal Chakraborty, urged the panel to heed the plea to spare the institution.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Metro lifeline 
                                                                                                               Metro lifeline 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Metro Railway proved to be the transport lifeline of the city as the Martyrs Day rally cut off road links to central Calcutta.         
	Participants at the rally also chose to avail themselves of the underground service in the absence of other options. As a result, Metro, till 5pm, recorded 35 per cent more footfall than usual despite several schools being shut and many regular commuters not venturing out.        
	We had to run two pairs of extra trains between 2pm and 5pm to tackle the rush, said a senior Metro official.        
	A few trains were briefly held up at Esplanade and Chandni Chowk stations as the compartment doors could not be closed because of overcrowding, said another official.        
	The ride was similar to that of a local train journey. The compartments were packed with rally participants. I had to get down at Esplanade but could not. I got off at Park Street and walked back, said Ranjit Goswami, a Lake Town resident who boarded a train at Belgachhia.

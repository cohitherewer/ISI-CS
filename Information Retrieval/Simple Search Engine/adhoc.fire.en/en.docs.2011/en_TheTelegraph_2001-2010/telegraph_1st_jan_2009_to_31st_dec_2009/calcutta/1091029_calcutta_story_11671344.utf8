	Calcuttans vexed with anomalies in their electricity bills can look forward to the pre-paid connection CESC is planning to introduce soon.        
	An official of the utility said the management was considering offering pre-paid connection to all its 2.4 million customers in the near future. A company source translated near future into three months or so.        
	The official said CESC had almost completed a trial run by testing a few hundred meters in factories, hospitals, offices and other institutions. Prepaid will benefit consumers and the utilities alike. A significant reduction in overhead costs, especially for meter reading and billing, is perhaps the biggest benefit of the system.        
	The service was made available by the state utility in 2006, when New Town housing estates and Salt Lake residents were offered prepaid connection. Consumers get a discount of 3 per cent on the tariff and end up paying around 7-8 per cent less than postpaid consumers every quarter, said Samar Biswas, a resident of Salt Lake.        
	Under the state utilitys system, consumers buy prepaid tokens with a 20-digit code, which has to be punched in on the meter keypad. The consumer is provided with power as long as there is balance in his credit. Even if the balance is exhausted, the supply is never snapped after 6 pm.

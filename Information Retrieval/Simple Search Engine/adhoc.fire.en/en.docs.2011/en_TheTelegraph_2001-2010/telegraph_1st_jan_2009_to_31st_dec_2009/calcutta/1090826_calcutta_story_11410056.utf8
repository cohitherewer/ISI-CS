  Maidan accident maims 3 passengers          OUR BUREAU                                                  
	Three passengers, sitting by the window with their elbows out, had their right arms ripped off on Tuesday when a speeding bus on the Maidan grazed the side of the minibus they were on.        
	The three grievously injured passengers  two of whom were battling for their lives till late on Tuesday  included a married couple, while four other passengers sustained minor injuries.        
	Around 11.15am, the minibus (WB-25A 2392) on the Howrah-Behala route was making its way to Behala via Dufferin Road, near the Maidan tents, when the driver spotted two private buses on route 12C racing towards it from the opposite direction.        
	The two buses on the same route were too busy racing each other to notice how perilously close they were to the minibus. Till it was too late.        
	The driver of the minibus swerved in desperation and rammed into a lamp post.        
	One of the speeding buses (WB-04A 3384) grazed the right side of the minibus, ripping off the arms of three passengers who were sitting with their elbows sticking out of the windows. The driver and conductors of the 12C bus fled within seconds, said a traffic policeman who witnessed the accident from a distance.        
	The injured were rushed to the SSKM Medical College and Hospital, but the damage had been done.        
	Behala resident Jayshree Chakraborty, in her thirties, lost her right arm. Her husband, Jadavpur Universitys Salt Lake campus employee Barun Chakrabortys arm was so badly mangled that it had to be amputated.        
	Their six-year-old son Subhajit, who was not sitting by the window, escaped unhurt.        
	Jayshrees condition is critical. She lost a lot of blood in the accident and its difficult to say if shell make it, said a source in SSKM.        
	Her husbands condition was better though the surgery to reconstruct his hand was unsuccessful.        
	Baruns hand was beyond surgical intervention, said a doctor.        
	Ashish Pal, a man in his forties from Assam, was moved to AMRI Hospitals at Dhakuria, where doctors tried but failed to save his right arm.        
	A part of the severed bone between Pals shoulder and elbow was missing. The severed portion of the arm had suffered multiple fractures, said Anupam Golash, a reconstructive surgeon at AMRI.        
	Pal was admitted to the intensive care unit of the hospital following the procedure.        
	It is a very tragic incident.... Rash driving must be minimised. Penal action against rash driving must be initiated with urgency, transport minister Ranjit Kundu said at Writers Buildings later in the day.        
	Whether the commission system can be abolished to minimise racing between buses is something I will look into later, added the man in the hot seat after the death of Subhas Chakraborty.        
	A few years ago, the right hand of Sukhani Paswan, a passenger travelling on a private bus, had been ripped off when another speeding bus tried overtaking it on Bidhan Sarani.        
	On Tuesday, police impounded both the bus and the minibus, which were towed to Maidan police station.        
	When Metro visited the police station to inspect the buses on Tuesday afternoon, the floor of the minibus was bathed in blood while the seats were blood splattered.        
	We have started a case of attempt to culpable homicide under section 308 of the IPC against the two bus drivers involved in the accident. They are yet to be traced, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police, headquarters.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Taxi refusal back with a ban(g)
                                                                                                               Taxi refusal back with a ban(g)

	Refusal by taxi drivers is on the rise, prompted by a mistaken notion of a depleted fleet following the government crackdown on vehicles more than 15 years old.        
	Since August 1, when the crackdown started, Ive been facing refusal across the city. If I approach 10 taxis, at least seven either refuse to take me in or charge extra fare. Sometimes when I ask a policeman to help me get a taxi, he reluctantly obliges, said Mansi Sharma, 27, an employee of a private bank.                
	I have sent at least three such messages over the past couple of weeks. On the first two occasions, there was no response. The third time, I got weird route directions as reply. I am yet to be informed of any action taken, said Zoheb Ahmed, 30, a techie from Salt Lake. Errant drivers should face exemplary monetary punishment. Or else, the trend will continue.        
	Additional police commissioner (in charge of traffic) K. Hari Rajan has requested commuters to alert the nearest traffic cop about a refusal or visit the closest kiosk to fill up a complaint card with the registration number of the taxi. But victims, speaking from experience, said following Hari Rajans advice would be an exercise in futility.        
	I had filled up a complaint card several weeks ago at a kiosk next to the Beadon Street-CR Avenue crossing. There has not been any follow-up action yet, said Jaswinder Kaur, 25.        
	Some officers from the traffic department admitted to being lenient while dealing with errant cabbies, citing more pressing engagements. Our hands are almost always full, more so on festive occasions, such as Durga puja, forcing us to be little lenient with errant drivers. But we always act whenever commuters lodge specific complaints or approach us for help to find a taxi, said a traffic policeman posted at the Shyambazar five-point crossing.        
	Theres no denying that traffic cops are less active in booking taxi drivers accused of refusing to ferry passengers. But I urge commuters not to shy away from lodging complaints, Hari Rajan said.        
	But why is refusal on the rise? Taxi owner-cum-driver Kanai Shaw said: There are fewer taxis (post-crackdown) and I have the luxury to refuse anyone whose destination is not to my liking.        
	But Shaw is mistaken. Since August 1, 30,000-33,000 taxis have been plying in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area daily. Though the fleet was 42,000-strong, never ever had more than 35,000 taxis hit the street on a given day before the ban came into effect. A total of 6,355 taxis came under the purview of the ban, only about 15 per cent of the fleet.

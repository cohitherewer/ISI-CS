          CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE                          A meeting in the Oceanic Library                                  
	A one-of-a-kind library has become the centre of a community development programme encompassing micro-finance, healthcare, income generation and education in an underdeveloped village near the city.        
	The library in Ullon village, near Kulpi in South 24-Parganas, is the latest project of Kapilananda Mandals Vivekananda Sevakendra-O-Sishu Uddyan, which started as a club.         
	Set up in June last year, the Oceanic Library, sponsored by Read Global, is governed by the local community management committee.        
	Through the library we want to meet the local peoples need to access information, said Kapilananda Mondal, the founder and CEO of the organisation.        
	The library is spread over 3,087sq ft on the ground floor of a large three-storeyed building, surrounded by a garden and water bodies. The library boasts of a regular, children, audio-visual and multimedia sections.        
	We have just started stocking the library and we hope to have sections on international books, the Sunderbans  since it is very close  and oceanography in keeping with the name of the library, said Mondal.        
	The long-term plan is to set up an educational institute, with courses on oceanography.         
	There are currently 2,486 books in the general section, 532 in the childrens section as well as 97 DVDs. The library also subscribes to six newspapers and five magazines.        
	Instead of membership cards, friendship cards are handed out to those who want to become a part of the library.         
	More than 35 villagers, most of them young, have become members. Even those who dont have library cards can use the reading room facilities.The audio-visual section will offer free access to a variety of economic, social and educational television programmes.        
	We are striving to make the Oceanic Library a vibrant community centre, dedicated to improving the quality of life of the people in the area, said Mondal.        
	The library with its Internet access will become even more crucial when BEd classes start on the premises in June. Books will be lent to schools every week to encourage reading on the campus. Text books will be purchased on the suggestion of students, many of whom cannot afford them.        
	To promote literacy among mothers, the library has started conducting skill upgrade training and health awareness. To generate funds, the library will rent out space for conducting workshops.        
	Our organisation has practised the principle of community development through utilisation of community resources. We will help people become economically independent and the proceeds will help sustain the library financially, said Mondal.

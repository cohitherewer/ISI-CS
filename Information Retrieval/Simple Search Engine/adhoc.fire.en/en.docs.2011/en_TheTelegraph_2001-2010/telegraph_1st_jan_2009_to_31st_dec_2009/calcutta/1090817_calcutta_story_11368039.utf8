The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rain to lessen in 48 hours
                                                                                                               Rain to lessen in 48 hours
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The frequent spells of rain on the weekend was triggered by a cyclonic circulation over Jharkhand which was heading towards Bihar by Sunday evening.        
	A cyclonic circulation over Jharkhand and its adjoining areas was responsible for the showers on Saturday and Sunday, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	The rainfall over south Bengal will lessen in intensity in the next 48 hours as the system is moving northward towards Bihar. The circulation, however, will bring heavy to very heavy rainfall in sub-Himalayan and the rest of north Bengal, Debnath added.        
	The upper air cyclonic circulation extended up to 2.1km above the mean sea level.        
	The city received 33.5mm of rain as the temperature varied between 30.1 and 26.6 degrees Celsius on Sunday.         
	Cloud imagery from satellite Kalpana-1 at 2.30pm on Sunday showed convective clouds over parts of southwest Bay of Bengal and sub-Himalayan Bengal.         
	Another upper-air cyclonic circulation over west Uttar Pradesh and its neighbourhood was seen extending up to the mid-tropospheric level.        
	Under the influence of the two systems, fairly widespread rainfall with isolated heavy to very heavy showers are likely in various states surrounding the region, including Bengal, over the next 48 hours, the weatherman said.        
	Mondays Calcutta will be generally cloudy with a few spells of rain or thundershower. Temperatures are likely to range between 26 and 30 degrees Celsius.

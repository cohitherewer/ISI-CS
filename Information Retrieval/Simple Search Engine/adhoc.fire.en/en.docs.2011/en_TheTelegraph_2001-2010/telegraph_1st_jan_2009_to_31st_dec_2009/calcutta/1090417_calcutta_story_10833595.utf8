	Around Rs 5.6 lakh of the money stolen from a College Street office was recovered from a village in Sultanpur district of Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday.        
	Police said Binoy Sharma, an employee of the office, had stolen around Rs 7.8 lakh late on March 30 and sent the money back home to Sultanpur through a friend. Sharma was arrested recently from his rented house in Creek Row. The money was kept underground at his ancestral home, said an officer.        
	Arrest: A 30-year-old who fled Howrah jail on December 19 last year was arrested in Lucknow on Wednesday. Dilip Singh, who was arrested on a murder charge, told the police that he was planning to form an extortion gang. Home secretary Ardhendu Sen said Singh would be interrogated to identify those in the jail who had helped him escape.

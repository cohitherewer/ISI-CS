The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | India to partner 2010 German trade fair
                                                                                                               India to partner 2010 German trade fair
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cutting-edge German technology could enrich upcoming office blocks and malls in Calcutta. The worlds largest industrial trade fair has come calling to town, with the promise of a tech-sharing platform to boost Bengals construction and infrastructure sectors.        
	Bauma, the biggest trade expo for building materials, mining machines and construction vehicles and equipment, will be held in Munich in April 2010, with India as the partner country.        
	We conducted a survey on demand in India, and it threw up a defined need for hi-tech office buildings and shopping centres, more so in Calcutta and eastern India, Eugen Egetenmeir, the deputy managing director of Messe Munchen GmbH, the organisers of Bauma, told Metro ahead of a city roadshow on Monday.        
	The study, carried out three years ago, revealed the need for latest innovations and best practices in proposed commercial and retail developments, in sync with the global slant towards more energy-efficient structures.        
	According to Egetenmeir, Bauma 2010 will offer the 38-odd exhibitors and over 5,000 visitors from India unique information on latest innovation and enable them to network and share best practices with the worlds leading manufacturers and suppliers.        
	The real estate fraternity in town hailed Bauma 2010 as a significant platform to upgrade preparedness. Today, the scale of development we are doing has increased manifold, and to execute such massive projects, we must use modern equipment. It helps improve quality, cut costs and shrink timelines, said Pradip Chopra, a member of the governing body of Credai.        
	Chopra felt Bauma was also a big opportunity to drive a hard bargain on construction vehicles and machinery in view of the global recession and oversupply of gear. A large number of Indian construction contractors is expected to participate under the Builders Association of India banner.        
	Rajesh Nath, the managing director of the German Engineering Federations (VDMA) India chapter, headquartered in Calcutta, said the mega trade show in Munich presented a launch pad for the second-coming of the components manufacturing segment in and around the city.        
	There are many small and medium family-owned enterprises in Calcutta trying to locate the right kind of international contacts who are looking to source components from India. Bauma can help them achieve that critical connect, Nath pointed out.        
	The Munich mega trade fairs focus on the east will be on mining, and this was welcomed by N.C. Jha, the director (technical) of Coal India Ltd. We must increase coal production from the present 500 million tonnes a year to 2 billion tonnes by 2032, to meet the growing energy demand. Bauma is an apt platform to help us achieve this by way of tech-sharing, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Im a chair, a traffic-stopper
                                                                                                               Im a chair, a traffic-stopper
                              THEY SEAT BOTH BUDDHA AND MAMATA: Red plastic chairs in the Metro channel. (Pradip Sanyal)                            
	Name: Chair, Red Plastic Chair.        
	Claim to fame: The most powerful chair in Calcutta.        
	Empty or occupied, I have the power to bring life to a halt in the heart of the city.        
	Chief minister or aspiring chief minister, I have the power to seat both.        
	And no, I dont have to be in Writers Buildings for that.        
	I was born in a factory off Visakhapatnam five years ago, but now my address is the Metro channel.        
	For 250 to 280 days in a year now I am on duty opposite Metro cinema, for meetings, rallies, protests, demonstrations, anything that can cause traffic trouble.        
	Though Im red in colour, I have no political affiliation. Over the years, I have borne the weight of both CPM and Trinamul leaders. During her fast in 2006, Mamata Banerjee would be with me on many a cold December evening. On August 31 this year, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee chose me over my comrades during the golden jubilee celebrations of the food movement.        
	But seating neither dhoti nor sari is my real claim to fame  bringing traffic to a standstill for several kilometres around the citys most popular protest platform is.        
	Set up a few banners and flags, gather some activists, place a few of us along the carriageway and you have the perfect recipe for a traffic disaster in the area. Thats real power, man!        
	This 70-odd metre strip of road, which can be crossed on foot on a protest-free day in less than two minutes, is what empowers me. I attend other events too, from weddings to funerals, but only when I am in the Metro channel do I feel powerful.        
	Ive seen it all this year. Whether it was the Gorkha students union convention in May demanding a separate state of Gorkhaland, or 10 lakh Trinamul activists observing their martyrs day on July 21. From seven lakh comrades commemorating five decades of the food movement in August to 70,000 CPM men demanding lower prices of essential goods last Friday.        
	Ive been there, done that.        
	I pity those of us who were sent elsewhere from the Visakhapatnam factory. Where else in the world can a red plastic chair slow a city down, day in and day out.        
	But let me confess, before you think I am just one of them, that I sometimes do feel guilty. When I see ambulances held up in the traffic snarl I help create, when students are late for exams, when the elderly and the little ones are taken ill being stranded in traffic for hours. I feel for the thousands who are often held up for hours by a few of us.        
	All this can so easily be averted with administrative action. But hey! Who am I to take that call? Mighty as I am, at the end of a hard days night, Im just a chair.        
	Lying, tied down with the others, at a godown at Wellington Square, I stare at the ceiling and wonder what awaits me the next day. And when the van heads for the Metro channel the morning after, I feel an adrenaline rush.        
	Here, I am not just a red plastic chair. I am a traffic-stopper. Like Shah Rukh Khan or Sachin Tendulkar.        
	(As told to Meghdeep Bhattacharyya)

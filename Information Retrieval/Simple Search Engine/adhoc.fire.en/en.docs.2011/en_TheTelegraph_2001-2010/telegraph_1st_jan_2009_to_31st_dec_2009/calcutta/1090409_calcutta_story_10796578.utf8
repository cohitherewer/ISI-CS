                                                                                                               The City Diary
                A 33-year-old man tried to commit suicide at Jatin Das Park Metro station on Wednesday morning but survived the attempt. Police said the resident of Howrah jumped in front of a Dum Dum-bound train at 10.03am but fell into the drain between the tracks and was unhurt when the train rolled over. He was taken to SSKM Hospital from where he was released after treatment. The man is unemployed and has been suffering from depression, cops said. Metro services were disrupted for 20 minutes as three Dum Dum-bound trains and two Tollygunge-bound trains were cancelled.    Sohel Mollah, 12, who ran away from his Ghutiary Shariff home in South 24-Parganas two years ago, was handed over to his parents on Wednesday by police and an NGO. The boy had been sent to the state-run Kishalay home in Barasat after Baranagar police spotted him near Dunlop. He could not recall his parents names. The NGO members traced his parents  Sayem Mollah and Manoara Biwi  from the missing complaints lodged with various police stations.    Passengers of a Howrah-bound launch had a close shave on Wednesday when another launch collided with it at Badhaghat on Wednesday morning. The serang of the Badhaghat-bound launch lost control because of the high tide, said an official. No one was injured.    The body of an unidentified middle-aged woman was found inside a well in an abandoned glass factory near Dunlop on Wednesday morning. Police said the woman would roam around in the area. Residents, alerted by a foul smell, entered the factory premises and saw the body. They informed the police who recovered the body.    Ruksana Bibi, 45, was allegedly killed by son-in-law Abdul Sattar at Jagaddal, on the northern fringes of the city, on Wednesday morning. Police said Sattar married Ruksanas daughter a few years ago and would regularly take money from her to gamble and buy alcohol. Sattar bore a grudge against Ruksana as she would ask her daughter not to give in to his demands. Things took an ugly turn on Tuesday night when Ruksana visited her daughters house and again advised her against giving money to Sattar. The son-in-law went to Ruksanas house and stabbed her during a quarrel. Sattar is now absconding, police said.    A fire broke out on the ground floor of Shree Digambar Jain Vidyalaya for Boys in Burrabazar on Wednesday. Around 12.50pm, security guards noticed smoke billowing out of a small room below the staircase which houses the feeder box. Security guards and local shop-owners had doused the blaze with the schools fire extinguishers before a tender arrived. A short-circuit in the feeder box is suspected to have caused the fire. No one was injured.    A diesel engine with empty rakes derailed near the Liluah level crossing at 11.20am on Wednesday disrupting services on the Howrah-Burdwan chord line. The trains that were to pass through the chord line were diverted to the main line. Services resumed at 12.35pm after the derailed engine and bogies were put on track.    A taxi knocked down a 53-year-old woman on Wednesday morning at the CIT Road-EM Bypass crossing. Bela Dutta, a resident of Nimta, was crossing the road when the taxi hit her. She was rushed to ESI Hospital with a leg injury. The taxi driver was taken to Maniktala police station.

                Sanju Kumar Shaw, 31, was found hanging in his Kankinara house in North 24-Parganas on Tuesday morning. Wife Soni lodged a police complaint alleging that Sanju was either murdered or forced to commit suicide by his father Kedar and elder brother Subhash, who regularly tortured Sanju. After the body was found, neighbours alerted police that Sanjus family was trying to hush up the death. The cops stopped the family members while they were carrying the body to a crematorium and asked Kedar to take it to Bhatpara State General Hospital. The police have started an unnatural death case. The accused duo are absconding.    A 51-year-old woman died on Tuesday afternoon, possibly of heat stroke.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Save people, says court
                                                                                                               Save people, says court
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta High Court on Friday disallowed a plea aimed at an extension of the July 31 deadline for the phase-out of old and polluting vehicles and told the government in no uncertain terms that it must find ways to implement the order.        
	The court has passed the order to save the general people. It is the duty of the state to carry out the courts directive. It has to decide how it will implement the order, the division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice B. Somadder said, following the pleas moved simultaneously by the Bengal Bus Syndicate and environment activist Subhas Dutta.        
	If the Syndicate was pushing for more time to get old vehicles replaced by new, Dutta was worried about the chaos on the streets.        
	Chief Justice Nijjar went on to observe: We have not passed the order to serve the interests of advocates or politicians or industrialists.... We have passed the order for the sake of the general people. Getting fresh air is their fundamental right.        
	State advocate general Balai Ray put up a do-it-now front and stated that his government was firm on phasing out 15-year-old commercial vehicles from the Calcutta Metropolitan Area.        
	We do not want any extension of the time limit fixed by the court. The bus owners got one year to replace their old vehicles, said Ray.        
	The advocate general was making a virtue out of a necessity as the court had earlier set the phase-out deadline on the basis of government recommendations. The government seeking another extension  following the one pleaded and won on the pretext of the Lok Sabha polls  could put administrative heads in the line of contempt.        
	Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty had summed up the contempt threat at Writers: The government has no alternative but to implement the high court order. If we dont then the chief secretary, the home secretary and the transport secretary would have to go to jail.        
	What the advocate general on Friday did not bother to explain was why the government had done precious little for the past 12 months, since the high courts July 18, 2008 order. The government has failed to phase-out old vehicles, replace two-stroke autos with single-mode LPG ones, crack down on illegal three-wheelers, stop the sale of adulterated fuel and monitor centres giving pollution under control certificates.        
	It is the fundamental duty of your government to provide fresh air and good heath to the general public. The government will have to decide how it will do it, environmentally, socially, politically... observed Chief Justice Nijjar.        
	With the high court firm on not hearing a plea on the phase-out matter till August 21, the bus syndicate will now move the Supreme Court.

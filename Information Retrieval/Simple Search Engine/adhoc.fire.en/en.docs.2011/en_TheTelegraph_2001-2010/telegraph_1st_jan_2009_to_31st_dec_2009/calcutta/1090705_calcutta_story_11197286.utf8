The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Couch potato kit 
                                                                                                               Couch potato kit 
          As digital cable, DTH and IPTV technologies crowd the TV screen, Rith Basu guides you on what to choose                          Arsenal plays Villarreal at the UEFA Champions League, April 2009                       
	Bare-bones cable television, digital cable, direct-to-home and IPTV  life in the couch is getting difficult. Most Calcutta TV homes use cable services, which bring to your drawing room what are known as analogue signals and are yesterdays technology, but couch potatoes with class cant just sit back and flip channels.               
	If they care for quality during the quality time they spend with their beloved box, they must now sit up and decide which of the above quartet of modes of transport that carry their pet programmes they wish to spend their couch lives with. Well, at least, until the next pretty young technology comes around.         
	No couch potato worth his salted chips will argue that the cable has run its course with its often grainy pictures, uneven sound, random shuffling of channels and, worse, wilful switching off of one and switching on of another. That leaves the other three methods to choose from  digital cable, direct-to-home or DTH, and Internet Protocol Television or IPTV. Its not enough to pick just the technology, within DTH there are several choices (see chart) and IPTV should shortly offer the same variety.         
	So how does one pick? As we said, the couch potatos work is getting harder.         
	Lets see if we can lighten your burden.         
	Correctly set up, there shouldnt be a great deal of difference between digital cable and DTH but in reality there often is. Cable TV carries satellite signals received in a control room through wires to your home. These are overhead wires where loss of signal quality occurs or, theoretically, should occur.         
	DTH beams directly into your home through a dish antenna put up on the roof, which means you receive the satellite signal directly with less signal quality loss. Another big difference: DTH offers a selection of packages. Digital cable provides no such freedom: you get everything at a fixed price, which, however, is lower than what DTH operators charge.         
	But back to the technology question. IPTV is the latest baby in town, though its carrier BSNL doesnt quite conjure that fetching image. Several of its experiments with IPTV having gone wrong, BSNL has now tied up with a new private player, the Delhi-based Smart Digivision Private Limited, to market the product under the brand name Myway.         
	Industry experts suggest that Myway  rather the concept its peddling, combining a telephone connection, Internet and television signals through a single broadband (the telecom equivalent of a road) connection  is the way to go.         
	Ah, freedom from the wire jungle, at last. Not so fast. Theoretically it sounds like two heavens, cyber and television, rolled into one. We leave out the third, the fixed phone line, because that immobile god has died.         
	Ones not sure what kind of service BSNL will provide. There is no track record yet to speak of because IPTV subscribers all over India number only about 13,000.         
	All we have is word of mouth. Pradip Singh, a 35-year-old businessman from Sinthi More, who has recently subscribed to Myway, is elated with the service. I had a Big TV connection and analogue cable before that. Picture and sound quality is much better than both those connections with IPTV. And I am sure, with a private player in it, BSNLs after-sales service too would be good, for it possibly cannot be worse than Big TVs.         
	Kapil Gupta, marketing head of Smart Digivision, which is marketing Myway in 54 cities, says: We have all the regional content and are in talks with channels like 24 Ghanta, which we still dont have in our bouquet. Thats the beauty of IPTV, we can go on adding channels unlike DTH. Also, our set-top box lets you record live TV and view it later.         
	DTHs ability to deliver channels is limited, though it can still carry more than a customer can possibly watch. IPTV, as well as digital cable, can beam a thousand and more channels. But its in DTH where the competition is the toughest with Big TV, Airtel digital TV and Sun Direct recently joining Tata Sky and Dish TV (See chart for comparison).         
	Plain-vanilla cable is still the dominant technology not only because of lack of consumer awareness and a reluctance to spend on set-top boxes, but also because the operators are not promoting digital services.         
	Triple play will rule the roost not long from now. If we sell our customers a set-top box now, we will have to ask them to buy another, improved version later. We may lose consumers to other options then. Thats why many cable operators do not want to sell too many set-top boxes, said a technician working with the cable industry that has 23 lakh customers in the city.

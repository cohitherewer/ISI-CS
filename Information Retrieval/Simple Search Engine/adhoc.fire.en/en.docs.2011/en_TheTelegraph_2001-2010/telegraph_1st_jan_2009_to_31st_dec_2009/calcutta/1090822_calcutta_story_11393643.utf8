                                                                                                               Lynch hint in death of theft suspect
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	An unidentified man in his late-20s was allegedly tied to a lamp post and beaten to death by a group of Kankulia Road residents early on Friday on the suspicion that he was a thief.        
	Police found the man lying unconscious near the lamp post around 1am and took him to MR Bangur Hospital, where he was declared dead.        
	A group of men chased and caught the youth after seeing him roam suspiciously in the area. They tied him to a lamp post and started hitting him. When the youth became unconscious, the attackers untied his hand and left, said a resident.        
	The residents denied witnessing the incident but there were bruises all over the youths body, said a police officer.         
	A preliminary medical examination suggested that the youth was a drug addict, added the officer.

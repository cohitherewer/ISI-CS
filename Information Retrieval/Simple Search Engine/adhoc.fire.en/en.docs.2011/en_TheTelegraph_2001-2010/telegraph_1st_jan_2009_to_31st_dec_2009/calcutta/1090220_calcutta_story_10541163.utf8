The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Water network for Bypass
                                                                                                               Water network for Bypass
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The civic body has taken up a Rs 255-crore scheme to lay pipes and set up three booster pumping stations to supply water from the proposed Dhapa treatment plant to Bypass households.         
	The proposal has been sent to the Centre for approval under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission.        
	The Dhapa plant, scheduled to start operations by January 2012, is being set up at a cost of Rs 100 crore. Its comand area will spread across 41.2sq km.        
	For effective distribution of water from the plant, we have taken up a Rs 255-crore scheme to lay pipelines and set up three booster pumping stations in Patuli, Mukundapur and Anandapur, civic commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said.        
	Stressing the need for a distribution network, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya cited the goof-up during the construction of booster pumping stations in Ranikuthi, Garfa and Daspara.        
	Even after the booster stations were commissioned, the residents had to wait for years for uninterrupted supply of water as there was no dedicated distribution network. We dont want to repeat the mistake on the eastern fringes, he said.        
	If the project is approved under the urban renewal mission, the civic body will have to shell out Rs 76.5 crore, or 30 per cent of the cost. The rest  Rs 178.5 crore  will be shared equally by the Centre and the state government.        
	According to civic estimates, the 13-km stretch of the Bypass, from Dhapa to Patuli, will be home to a million people by the time the water treatment plant starts functioning. The households in these areas are now dependent on deep tubewells for potable water.

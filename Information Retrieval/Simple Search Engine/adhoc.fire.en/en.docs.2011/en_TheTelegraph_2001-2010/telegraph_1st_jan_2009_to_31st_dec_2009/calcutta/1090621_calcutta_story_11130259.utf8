The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tomorrow is today
                                                                                                               Tomorrow is today
                              Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi has opted for voluntary power cuts and installed a solar energy system at Raj Bhavan. A Telegraph picture                             
	It was 1967 and Martin Luther King was delivering a speech in New York City. We are faced with the fact, my friends, he said, that tomorrow is today. We are confronted with the fierce urgency of now.        
	The context he was speaking in was very different  he was talking about ending the Vietnam war  but he may as well have been referring to Calcuttas environment.         
	The quality of air we breathe, the threats to our parks and open spaces, the free-for-all fate of our trees and green cover, the excessively high decibel levels around our schools, hospitals and homes  these are not distant possibilities or sporadic events. These problems are real, present and pressing. Calcuttas environmental imperatives demand action now.        
	The need for urgent action contrasts with our propensity for ritual. World Environment Day 2009, on June 5, passed with the usual volley of speeches and functions. A sapling here, a souvenir there. Certainly we need them. Symbols and symbolism inspire and they encapsulate meaning and emotion. But when we allow ourselves to be lulled by symbolism into believing that we have marked the day and done our bit, we become conspirators if not culpable in the assault on Calcuttas environment.        
	Action can take many forms. Look at what has been happening in Calcuttas Raj Bhavan. About a year ago, the governor initiated a voluntary daily power cut of two hours as a mark of solidarity, some said, with the ordinary people having to suffer power cuts every day. These voluntary power cuts continue to date. A few months later, in collaboration with the West Bengal Green Energy Development Corporation, he undertook a programme to install sufficient solar energy capacity to take care of 30% of Raj Bhavans power requirement. And this year, on World Environment Day, in fact, he announced a plan to make Raj Bhavan carbon neutral by reducing water and electricity consumption, among other steps. The power of focused action.        
	Look again at the determination of the 14-year old child in a businessmans family. She will just not use plastic bags, nor will she allow plastic bags to enter their home. It means badgering her mother, bullying the household help and boycotting the stubborn retailer  but thats her action and thats her response to the fierce urgency of now. The power of passion.        
	These examples show that action is possible. What differentiates such action from ritual is that it is sustained, focused and determined. It does not matter if the action is small and it is not necessary that it should require giving up something. As long as the action seeks to reduce  directly or indirectly  the consumption of carbon-based products/services, or to remove carbon from the environment.         
	What matters is that we act now and persist with the action. To paraphrase another of Martin Luther Kings inspirational sayings, the odds can never be too great or the struggle too hard for the power of hope and commitment.                     BONANI KAKKAR

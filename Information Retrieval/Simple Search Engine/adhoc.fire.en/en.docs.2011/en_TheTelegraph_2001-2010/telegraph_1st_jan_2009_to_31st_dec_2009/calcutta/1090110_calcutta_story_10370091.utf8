                      Calcutta canvas                    Born and brought up in a modern Indian city, it was natural for Balaka Bhattacharjee to spontaneously construct a narrative on the lives of the people who live in the same city and also call it their home. Daughter of Bikash Bhattacharjee, she follows her fathers footsteps and juxtaposes Western realistic style with surrealistic tradition. Specifically speaking, ... sidesteps, her current series, is a narrative that creates a third state of reality from the intertwining of personal and external influences and experiences. It is a project that originated from her personal reflections. In it, the artist as observer is not an objective presence; rather she is a combination of the persevering ideas, ideals and desires of the present and a product of a compromise of a situational survival of the fittest. It is this composite that has led to the construction of the city in its form, where the personal is aspiring against the external and the external is being eroded by the force of the aspiring. Depicting the emotional state of the city, her works personify it as a living, breathing system, bred out of the hopes and longings of those who inhabit its space. Her works are partly photographed and partly painted; the photographic part is practical and real, and the painted, the surreal and hyper-real.                    Event: A solo exhibition of paintings by Balaka Bhattacharjee When: Till January 22 (except Sundays); 11 am - 8 pm Where: Gallery Sanskriti, 8C Alipore Park Road

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Downturn robs bourse of cash for land
                                                  Downturn robs bourse of cash for land

	A downturn-induced drop in land prices has prevented the cash-strapped Calcutta Stock Exchange from auctioning off a five-acre EM Bypass plot that was to have been its financial lifeline.        
	Uncertainty over the price of land and lack of interest among potential buyers have forced us to push the pause button for the time being in consultation with the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, which is the original lessor of the land, Sunil Mitra, the director of the stock exchange and the states power secretary, told Metro.        
	The beleaguered bourse was banking on the auction to fetch it Rs 150 crore, which is 60 per cent of the expected price. The five acres are located a few hundred metres from a plot that the LIC had purchased in 2007 for a record Calcutta price of Rs 55 crore an acre.        
	But those were different times. The markets were on a roll, real estate was gold and the LIC was ready to outbid anybody who had an eye on that plot.        
	Land prices have now fallen to an extent that it no longer makes business sense to auction off the plot, Mitra said.         
	The five acres, adjacent to the Milan Mela fairground, were part of a 10-acre plot that the stock exchange had acquired on lease for 33 years from the civic body in 1995.        
	The century-old stock exchange signed an agreement with the civic body in July last year, agreeing to transfer half the plot to the Milan Mela and auction off the rest in exchange for a plot of similar size in Rajarhat. As part of the deal, 40 per cent of the auction proceeds were to go into the civic bodys coffers. The stock exchange paid Rs 25 crore for the Rajarhat plot.        
	Realtor Rahul Saraf said the price of land along the Bypass might have declined by 25-30 per cent since the downturn struck. No land deal has been inked since the LIC paid a record price for a plot.        
	The stock exchange has initiated a discussion with the civic authorities to insert a land-transfer provision in the agreement.         
	The stock exchange wants a clause that will enable 60 per cent of the landholding, or three acres, to be handed back to it along with the right to transfer the lease at a later date through an auction, a source said.         
	Mitra said the Rajarhat deal added to the bourses financial problems. Compared to what Wipro paid for land there, our cost was much higher. While allotting us land in Rajarhat, the civic body was guided by the highest land price it had got from other buyers at that time.

	The article Lobby of lost youth, October 4, brought to my mind the memory of the lobby of another institution  Jadavpur University arts department. To all old-timers it was the perfect place of rendezvous, it was the place where love first blossomed, friendships were forged and storms in teacups started. The long corridor with steps leading out to the driveway facing the main road lost much of its charm after it was grilled in but in spite of it, it was not the canteen but always the lobby where we met and spent hours on end. Thank you Metro for re-kindling an old flame and propelling a nostalgic trip down memory lane.             
	Shipra Chakraborty,
  CIT Road                
	Apropos the article Scrap it!, October 18, the word that bothers me most is chalo. Every time my sister speaks on the phone with a friend, at the end of the conversation she says, Okay, chalo, tata. I keep wondering why they say chalo? After all, where would they go?             
	Shravani Sengupta,
  Sodepur                     
	The words which I find annoying are believe you me, no mention, be pojitib (positive), and kewl (cool)           
	Aayan Banerjee

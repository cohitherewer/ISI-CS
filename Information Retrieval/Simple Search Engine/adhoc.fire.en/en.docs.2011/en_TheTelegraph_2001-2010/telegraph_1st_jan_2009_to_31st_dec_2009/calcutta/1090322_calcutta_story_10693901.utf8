The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | City Lights
                                                                                                                 City Lights
      When the light is right                        German consul-general G uuml;nter Wehrmann in front of one of his works on display at the Palladian Lounge (Aranya Sen) ; (below) a Smaranika card                    
	Gnter Wehrmanns love affair with his Leica is well chronicled, and we have been exposed to the German consul-generals expertise with the lens in the past through a solo exhibition at The Taj Bengal.    
	Those were his takes on Calcutta, which has grown on him like no other mission posting in his career. The affable envoys recent exposition of photographs of Berlin Mitte, the heart of the erstwhile Communist East Berlin, now mounted at the Palladian Lounge, captures the spirit of the locations with the same dramatic use of daylight.    
	These photographs dont represent a definitive interpretation of Berlin Mitte, nor is there any underlying political message. These were places I liked to visit during my midweek trips to Berlin (from Bonn) to attend meetings at the Federal Foreign Office in 2000 and 2001. Most of these places were at walking distance from the Foreign Office hostel where I put up. When the light was right, I clicked, and this is the resultant series, Wehrmann said.    
	His personal favourite is a frame showing a bank of motorised tourist rickshaws parked in front of the Reichstag (the German Parliament building). They remind me of the Calcutta autorickshaws, of course running on cleaner fuel, he smiled.    
	The splendid glass dome of the Reichstag, redesigned by celebrated British architect Sir Norman Foster to hold the Bundestag, the German Parliament, the Gendarmenmarkt or Sentries Square, the gleaming towers of Potsdamer Platz, all favourite Berlin landmarks  are captured in brilliant wash of natural light, his signature style.    
	Wehrmanns Berlin Mitte series was first shown in various towns and cities in New England in 2004 and in Boston in 2005, receiving critical acclaim. The exhibition will be on at the Palladian Lounge through March 31. It will be put up at the Calcutta Information Centre two weeks later.        
	Greetings with art    
	A line from Shankho Ghoshs poem Boiragitola, a dialogue torn from Manoj Mitras play Ashwatthama or Chandi Lahiris cartoon  the range of Smaranika cards, recently unveiled, throws open a whole new source of expression and experiences.     
	Apart from the above names the cards bear lines penned or drawn by Amjad Ali Khan, Joy Goswami, Sunil Gangopadhyay, Bivas Chakraborty, Nirendranath Chakraborty, Suchitra Mitra, Soumitra Chattopadhyay, Narayan Debnath, Samir Aich and Srijato to mention a few.     
	Each card, priced at Rs 15 to Rs 25 and autographed by the luminaries, could certainly have made ones day, had the choice of illustrations and overall designs been better.     
	The visual of clay idol heads being fired with Manoj Mitras lines on the deep creative urge is disturbing. The sight of fire and heads upside down evokes more a sense of destruction than creation.     
	Debashis Sawoo, whose photographs appear in most cards, is self-taught but has to his credit a Commonwealth and a Lalit Kala Award. Sawoo, who works in the transport business, has taken up this unusual venture for love. The cards, he feels, will excite die-hard fans and initiate greenhorns from every field.     
	Showing off his own lensmanship is of course another incentive. And it will work if a little more care is taken in selection and the source of each excerpt mentioned. So that those who likes the line quoted can move on to the whole book. Sawoo and his team of 12 photographers and technicians hope to provide marriage videos, innovative albums, personalised crystal and T-shirt printing from their shop in Talkie Show House Building, Fariapukur. The cards will be available from various outlets.         
	Ray birthday    
	Satyajit Rays birthday bash will be bigger than usual this year, said son Sandip Ray, the member-secretary of the Ray Society, which is organising the events.     
	This had been our plan for a very long time. This time we hope to see it through. From May 3-10 there will be a large exhibition of his photographs and graphics at the Birla Academy. The Birla Academy auditorium will be used simultaneously for various other programmes centering around his works. From May 7-10 the event will spread to the Star where there will be another exhibition on a smaller scale, a theatre festival and a performance by two Bangla bands, said Rays filmmaker son.     
	Among the events slated for the Birla Academy auditorium are a keynote address on Day One but the search for a Ray specialist is still on.     
	We are trying to bring in someone really qualified to speak on his works but we havent found him yet, said Sandip Ray.     
	There will be a debate on Ray, a quiz and we hope to organise a few film screenings as well, said Sandip Ray, adding that Ray Society hopes to screen some of his short films not yet available on disc.     
	The schedule so far has Inner Eye, Rabindranath, Bala Saraswati, Sadgati and Piku.    
	The plays at Star will all be based on Rays works. We have spoken to three groups  Banku Babur Bandhu by Swapnasandhani, Anukul by Theatre Passion and Opsora Theaterer Mamla by Charbak. The two bands who have agreed to sing for Ray are Bhoomi and Chandrabindu. They will sing some of Rays songs and also sing their own compositions.    
	Sandip said that a book on Rays graphics being compiled by Joyoti Sen for the society may not be ready on time, but a brochure will be brought out on the occasion. The Ray Society is, however, looking for sponsorship.     
	Subhro Saha and Sebanti Sarkar

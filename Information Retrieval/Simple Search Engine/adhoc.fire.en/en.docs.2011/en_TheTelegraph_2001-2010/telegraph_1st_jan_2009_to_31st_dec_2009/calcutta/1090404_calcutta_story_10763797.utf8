The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | DIY mission for clean city 
                                                                                                               DIY mission for clean city

	Calcuttas GeNext has started adopting the DIY (do-it-yourself) ethic to create the clean, green city that they crave and the authorities fail to provide.        
	A small start made by some schoolchildren with a cleaning drive in Southern Avenue last month was carried forward by another group of young volunteers at Park Circus maidan on Friday morning and looks set to become a mini movement led by young guns.        
	Just three hours of activism saw Park Circus maidan being rid of two tonnes of garbage. Sachin Agarwal, 18, was a tired  but satisfied  boy at the end of Mission Park Circus. I am a regular at the ground for cricket matches. I have often wondered why the civic body doesnt keep it clean. Then one day I asked myself what I could do about it, he said.        
	So, broom replaced bat in Sachins hands as he and 50-odd like-minded people, many of them schoolchildren, got down to work around 6am. Some residents joined the campaign.        
	Teenager Mohammed Mustafa said it was time young people launched campaigns in every locality. How long can we wait for the government machinery to give us something as basic as a clean environment?         
	Anjan Banerjee, a member of the Orient Row Talbagan We Care Committee, was impressed. These kids slogged for three hours and cleared the Orient Row entrance to the maidan that was blocked by garbage for years.         
	He doesnt remember the last time the civic body cleaned the green. We have been told that there are 12 employees for maintenance. We havent seen even one of them.        
	Come Sunday, students and residents of Park Circus will converge on the maidan again to pick up where they left off on Friday.        
	Students of La Martiniere had cleared Southern Avenue of tonnes of waste last month. Our motto is to lead by example. Dont wait for anyone to act, do it yourself, said Jyoti Khemka of the Nature Club of La Martiniere for Girls.         
	Whats next for GeNext?        
	Conservationist Mudar Patherya, who mobilised the students to clean a stretch of Park Circus maidan, said Mission Clean would definitely move to other parts of the city. Many schools have pledged support. We intend cleaning up the area around Victoria Memorial and then take the movement to Salt Lake.

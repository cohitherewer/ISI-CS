The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Garden atop Writers car park
                                                                                                               Garden atop Writers car park
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The construction site of the underground car park. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                  
	A garden is soon expected to come up on the grounds opposite Writers Buildings by Laldighi, the tank at the centre of BBD Bag. The greenery will camouflage a two-tier underground car park for 650 plus vehicles that should open before Puja.         
	The tramlines that used to be there on this section of Laldighi have been removed. The tracks have been laid before Telephone Bhavan now. All this for the benefit of ministers, administrators, foreign delegates and other VIPs. Till now their cars have been parked anywhere drivers have found convenient.        
	As of now, it looks as if a huge double-storeyed building is coming up on the site, with only this difference  it is a subterranean building. For the first time in this state, giant pre-stressed concrete slabs  62m x 44m each and cast in a single day  were made for the car park. Five such slabs have been produced, and the sixth one will be made soon.        
	One can view the BBD Bag skyline from within the first-floor berth held up by squat concrete pillars. But this flurry of construction activity is not visible from outside as a wall of tin sheets has been erected around the construction site.         
	The proposed garden on top will take some more time to be ready. Constructed at a cost of Rs 35 crore, this concrete structure, 212m x 45m and 5.5m deep holds back the waters of Laldighi. It is expected to solve the perennial parking problem that plagued Bengals administrative hub. There was no permanent space for parking the 400 plus cars and the existing car park was inadequate.        
	Work on the subterranean car park began in July 2007. Initially it was proposed that 92 trees will have to be felled to accommodate the car park, but ultimately, only 25 to 26 of them were removed.         
	The plan of the car park was prepared by the public works department and is being executed by Mackintosh Burn Ltd, now a state government-managed company.        
	The car park will have three exits and an equal number of entrances, all facing Writers Buildings and approachable by ramps. All of these will be manually operated. The VVIP enclosure on the first basement will be an exclusive affair for security reasons. A car lift will raise vehicles in need of repairs so that these can be driven out from the rear end without hindering the ramps.

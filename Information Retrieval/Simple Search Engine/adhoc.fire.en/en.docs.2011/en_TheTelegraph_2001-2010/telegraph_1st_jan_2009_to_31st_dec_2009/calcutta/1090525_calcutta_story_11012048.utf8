The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Nervous nineties for scores of examinees
                                                                                                               Nervous nineties for scores of examinees
  - GenX raises the bar with near-100 scores, but still no guarantee of seats in colleges of choice          CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE                          Students exult after their ISC exam results. A Telegraph picture                                        
	Nikunj Bhaia is in the nineties, and nervous. If only he were playing just a game of cricket!        
	So what if I have a 90-plus score? Hundreds of other ISC examinees have the same kind of marks. My 91 per cent isnt helping my cause, which is to join the college of my choice, laments the science student from Don Bosco School, Park Circus.        
	Ninety is the new 80 in school-leaving examinations, and students are raising the bar every year  just like Subhojit 99.25 Ghosh, who went where no student has gone before in this years ISC exam.        
	Even a decade ago, getting 90-plus was a rare feat. Suddenly it isnt enough, and not just because the neighbours son or daughter has also scored 90 per cent and more. Nikunj, who has applied for a computer engineering seat at the Nanyang Technology University in Singapore, isnt sure his score will see him through. If Nanyang remains out of reach, he will settle for BITS Pilani.        
	And he by no means is the only one stuck in the nervous nineties. Ritwika Chatterjee (name changed), who scored 92 per cent in ISC, had her heart set on St Stephens College but is now bracing for rejection. Had I scored 85 per cent, I would have known that I dont stand a chance. The irony is that despite scoring more than 90, I am in the same place as I would have been had I scored 85 per cent, she explains.        
	For GenX, scores that do not guarantee their entry into colleges or universities of their choice apparently mean little. Teachers and psychologists fear that some high performers even see this as a failure and might sink into depression.        
	According to psychologist Anuttama Banerjee, it is not just about competition but also the goals that a student sets for oneself. A student should aim to make a career rather than associate success with getting into a particular college. The ones who score more than 90 per cent should actually be more ready to take up the challenge of doing well by studying in a college that may not have been their first choice, she says.                                      
	Banerjee thinks negative feelings among high performers sometimes reflect insecurity and counselling is the only way out.        
	Keya Sinha, the principal of Vivekananda Mission School, feels even parents need to be counselled. I meet students regularly and tell them and their parents that they should always have more than one option so that the disappointment of not fulfilling one ambition or dream is not intense, she says.        
	Yash Damani of Don Bosco, who scored 93 per cent in ISC, argues that it isnt as easy as it sounds. My future depends on where I study, and it is hard to see my career slip away despite me getting a good score. I wish there were more A-level colleges in India to choose from.        
	Vaibhav Mundra is in the same rocking boat despite 93.5 per cent against his name. My chances of studying in National University of Singapore seem bleak. If I have to stay back in India, I would like to study commerce and my only hope is St Xaviers College. Even Sri Ram College of Commerce (in Delhi) could be beyond me, he says.

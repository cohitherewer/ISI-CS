                Twelve people were arrested on Tuesday afternoon for ransacking the premises of Millennium Park and the adjoining office of Vivada Inland Waterways, a launch service. The park has been shut for more than a month over a dispute between security personnel and the management. Around 100 people who had come to the park on Id had turned violent after finding it shut.    Tollywood actor Parambrata Chattopadhyay, who surrendered before the court on Tuesday, was granted unconditional bail. An arrest warrant was issued against Parambrata after actress Swastika Mukherjees husband Pramit Sen lodged a police complaint against him.    Metro Railway service was disrupted on Tuesday evening after a 50-year-old man jumped in front of a train at Shyambazar station. The man survived since the driver braked in time.     Around 2,000 people have been rounded up in Behala, Thakurpukur and Regent Park in a pre-Puja drive since September 6.

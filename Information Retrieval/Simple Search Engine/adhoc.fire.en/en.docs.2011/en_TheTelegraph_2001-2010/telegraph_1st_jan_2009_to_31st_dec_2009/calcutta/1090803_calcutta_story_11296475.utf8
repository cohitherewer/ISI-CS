The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pupils not bite-bright
                                                                                                               Pupils not bite-bright

	Most school students in Calcutta are ignorant about mosquito-borne diseases though the spread of malaria, dengue and chikungunya has been rampant in the city for the past several years, a study has revealed.        
	Less than half the respondents in the study, conducted by the vector-control wing of the civic body, were found to be aware about how mosquito- or vector-borne diseases spread and their prevention and treatment.        
	The findings have prompted municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay to order an intense awareness campaign on vector-borne diseases among school students.         
	Chief municipal health officer DebDwaipayan Chattopadhyay said: The target audience of our campaigns will be students, who in turn will educate their parents about the diseases.         
	A total of 414 Class IX students of La Martiniere for Girls, Deshbandhu Girls High School and Loreto Day School, who took part in the study, were asked 30 objective questions on malaria, dengue and chikungunya.         
	Asked about the low level of awareness of the students, a teacher of La Martiniere for Girls said: Students not interested in science give up biology after Class VIII and tend to forget what they have learnt.         
	Malini Bhagat, the principal of Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School, said: Most students do not feel inclined to know about a disease unless a family member is affected by it. Civic officials should conduct quizzes on such ailments in schools to spread awareness.         
	The chief civic entomologist, Debashis Biswas, said the overall awareness of the students of La Martiniere and Loreto was slightly higher than that of Deshbandhu Girls High School. There have been some variations, though. For example 83.3 per cent of the Loreto students could answer which part of the mosquitos body spreads diseases, against 74 and 76.2 per cent of the La Martiniere and Deshbandhu students.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A library lost, a car saved   Readers lose pole position to poll army
                                                                                                               A library lost, a car saved     -  Readers lose pole position to poll army
          A STAFF REPORTER                            FIRST A POLE, THEN A FRAME AND NOW A CAGE: One step at a time, the Election Commission army has invaded and violated the countrys leading library. Telegraph pictures				                                       
	Tuesday marked the beginning of the rerun of the election-induced horrors of 2006 for readers at National Library.        
	More than 10 vehicles used by the Election Commission were parked on one flank of the sprawling Alipore address for most of the day, forcing visitors to take a detour to reach the canteen. Some readers were accused of loitering and questioned by officials deputed by the commission to oversee the takeover of the abode of books for the ballot battle.        
	This is nothing but harassment. We entered the library after writing our names and addresses on the register at the main gate but we were again asked to show our identity cards. They (the officials) should mind their own business, complained Anjan Das, a regular at the library for the past 10 years.        
	Moinak Dey, who has been a reader at the library since 1994, said he shuddered to think what would happen once the central forces moved in.         
	I am sure the worst is yet to come. Paramilitary personnel will start staying in tents on the campus within a couple of days and this place will be a royal mess. I remember being intercepted at the gate and asked unnecessary questions by security personnel during the 2006 election. It was a terrible experience, he added.        
	Saibal Chakraborty, the general secretary of the National Library Staff Association, said the commission should have issued identity cards to the workers engaged to set up tents if it was so concerned about security.         
	All readers are required to sign the register at the main gate but these workers are free to enter and leave the premises without any checks. Why are security personnel questioning readers and allowing workers to move about freely. The library is for readers, not outsiders, he grumbled.        
	The director of National Library, K.K. Banerjee, tried to placate angry readers and employees by saying that the Election Commission had assured him of minimal disruption in the days ahead.         
	I have been told that readers would not be inconvenienced. I hope they (commission officials) keep their promise and take measures to minimise inconvenience, if any. Library services should not be disrupted at any cost, he said.                  
	What if the assurance turns out to be a hollow one like chief electoral officer Debashis Sens promise to keep the readers interest in mind while taking a call on whether to take over the library?        
	Banerjee said the library would request the Union culture ministrys intervention the next time the commission tried to requisition the premises. I hope the Election Commission will think twice before invading the library for another poll. The criticism it has faced from various quarters this time should be a lesson.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had apologised after a business meet he attended at the library in 2005 inconvenienced readers. The Election Commission has so far shown no inclination to follow in his footsteps and spare the seat of learning.

  - Private walls plastered with posters as police fail to curb decibel devil          A STAFF REPORTER                                                   
	The government has demanded an explanation within 24 hours from its police arm why the decibel ban was drowned by the cracker bang this Diwali.        
	Chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti on Monday sought a detailed report from police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti and his counterparts in the districts of North and South 24-Parganas and Howrah on the extent of banned crackers used on Saturday night.        
	If this year was bad compared to previous years and more banned crackers were burst then there was negligence, said the chief secretary. But you cant bring about change in a day. It has to happen gradually.        
	Gradual is not something those believing in the power of deterrence will buy. There has to be this feeling that the consequence of bursting banned crackers can be very serious, said former police commissioner Tushar Talukdar.        
	After the chief minister was jolted out of his home by the cracker cacophony in his neighbourhood late on Saturday, cops did launch a crackdown. But in most cases, those picked up were either booked under section 66 of the Calcutta Police Act or section 40 of the Suburban Police Act. Both are bailable and carry a fine of just Rs 50. Many others were just let off with a warning.        
	The only way to stop this menace is through tough and exemplary action against violators of the ban. The police did too little too late, said a retired IPS officer.        
	If fear is to be spread among offenders or potential offenders, then violators can be fined up to Rs 1 lakh or prosecuted under the Environment Protection Act, 1986, which can lead to up to five years in jail.                                                   
	Every police station should involve prominent people under their jurisdiction to ensure that the ban is followed during Diwali. If any such public personality is found flouting the rule himself, he should be booked immediately to make him realise that no one is above the law, said added Talukdar.        
	Deterrence, explain those following the Talukdar line, works best when the police make examples out of those in the public eye. Nothing is better, they say, than the if it has happened to him it can easily happen to me fear factor.        
	VP Singhs raid raj in the 1980s had put the fear of the devil into big businesses and forced them to clean up their act, recounted a retired top cop. The cracker ban will be most easily imposed if the police can catch a prominent Calcuttan in the act. But for this police action must be intense and information specific.        
	In the Diwali week, police action was loose and lackadaisical till late on Saturday when they launched random raids. Arrests must be carried out systematically in order to have the greatest impact, said a senior officer of the pollution control board.        
	The first seeds of deterrence were sowed on Diwali night, with several upscale residential areas being targeted. Being dragged into a police jeep and then detained at a police station for two hours will stop many violators, their families and friends from flouting the noise ban next time, said an officer.        
	Agreed a young businessman in Alipore: Many innocent friends of mine were picked up. We will never burst noisy crackers again.

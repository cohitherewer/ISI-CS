The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Night haunts feel moody blues
                                                                                                               Night haunts feel moody blues
  - Footfall drops and spending dwindles as price point decides party zone          A STAFF REPORTER                          missing in action: Nightclubs are feeling the pinch as the party people watch their pockets                                        
	Sayan Banerjee, 27, used to spend Rs 4,000 every Saturday night clubbing with his friends. That was then (pre-October). Now, Sayan goes clubbing only one Saturday night a month and that too only to spend Rs 1,000. The rest of the weekends, he and his friends take turns to play host at home.        
	The motto for the IT gang has changed within weeks from work hard, party harder to work lots, party little (and that too mostly at home).        
	The party places are of course facing the pinch. Things are going slow, admits Sovan Mukherjee of Shisha, at 22 Camac Street. The corporate crowd has thinned and reservations are down by 50 per cent with big spenders from the IT sector staying away.        
	Footfall is dropping and spending is dwindling at every happy haunt. Corporate-spending has gone down, says Bunty Sethi of Venom. We used to have at least six to eight corporate parties of 80-100 people in a month. This January we didnt have any.        
	The downturn, the no-smoking sign and a rise in VAT on liquor are the ruling reasons for the party people going missing and the new year not being so happy for nightclubs.        
	With the party zone shifting from the lounge to the living room, independent liquor stores have seen a spurt in sales. Retail sales have increased by 30-35 per cent in the past two-three months and distribution has gone up by 20-25 per cent. Clearly, the price point now matters. With Rs 250 you can have one drink in a nightclub but three-four pegs at home, says Premjit Chatterjee, who owns a liquor store in Ballygunge.              
	With youngsters in the IT sector spending less, many standalone pubs are in a tizzy. There is a 25 per cent decline in supply to these independent pubs, says Kaushik Chatterjee of United Spirits Limited (East). Volumes, he claims, have not been hit but the nature of flow has changed. The super-premium segment is always doing well. It is in the medium segment that we see a shift in terms of compromise, explains Chatterjee.        
	Also scoring on price point is the social club. Instead of going to a five-star hotel or a restaurant, a club is a far more economical option. In the evenings, our bar-side lawn is full now and sometimes we have to put out extra tables, says Rajen Sood, the president of Saturday Club.        
	With the going getting tough, innovation is the name of the game at some night clubs. Roxy, for one, has decided to marry music, mocktails and movies to beat the meltdown moody blues. The lounge at The Park will screen foreign-language films every alternate Wednesday evening, with club rules but no entry fee.        
	World Cinema Wednesdays is, of course, an effort to increase footfalls but it is also about catering to the demand for foreign films in Calcutta. The kind of people who frequent Roxy are always on the lookout for the best of world cinema. That makes Roxy the perfect venue for a movie show, says Namrata Ray, the manager of events and entertainment at Roxy.

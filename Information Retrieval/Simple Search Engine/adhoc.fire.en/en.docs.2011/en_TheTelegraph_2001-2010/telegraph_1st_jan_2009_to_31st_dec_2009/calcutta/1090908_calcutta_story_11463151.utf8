The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Citys tryst with stars and style
                                                                                                               Citys tryst with stars and style
  - Five-day fashion show draws design biggies with celebs on the ramp          A STAFF REPORTER                            SLAM BANG: Virender Sehwag and Salman Khan are expected to walk the ramp                                       
	With a team list that has Ritu Kumar opening the batting, Virender Sehwag and (probably) Salman Khan as the pinch hitters, Ustad Amjad Ali Khan as the all-rounder, Manish Malhotra all padded up and Mahendra Singh Dhoni as the (non-playing) captain, its game on at Kolkata Fashion Week II.        
	Emami Kolkata Fashion Week, with t2 as partner, promises to be bigger and better, more starry and stylish than Season One as it storms ITC The Sonar Calcutta from September 9 to 13.        
	The show-stopping line-up is seriously starry, but the focus will be on fashion, stresses Yudhajit Dutta, the Mindscapes Maestros man who has given Calcutta its own fashion week with Dhoni as its brand ambassador. The celebrity angle is there but we have to remember this show is about fashion, designers and trade, says the 25-year-old from Jodhpur Park.        
	So, serious star-spotting apart  from Giselle Love Aaj Kal Monteiro to Neil Nitin Mukesh  its time for Calcutta to gape at some substantial style. From 18 designers in April to 38 in September, KFW II has already made a big leap. Opening the big fat fashion fest on Wednesday is Ritu Kumar, the grand dame who started out in Calcutta, and closing the show on Sunday will be Bollywoods favourite designer Manish Malhotra. In between, the city will host some of the countrys top designers like Wendell Rodricks and Narendra Kumar.        
	From this part of the world there will be Calcuttans Kiran Uttam Ghosh, Monapali and many more, plus Bibi Russell from beyond the border.        
	On the ramp, Bollywood biggies apart, Tollywood will enjoy its share of the spotlight. Leading the way will be Rituparna Sengupta, with Parambrata Chattopadhyay and Paoli Dam making their runway debuts. But the big question  Salman yes or no  can only be answered at the last minute with the organisers keeping their fingers crossed because of the Khans unpredictable ways.        
	But there is nothing unpredictable about the buzz generated by KFW II, with Calcutta eagerly awaiting its big bi-annual tryst with fashion. The first edition of the fashion week was very popular and I went for a few shows. This time too I will definitely be there, says Madhu Neotia.

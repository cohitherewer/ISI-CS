The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Life term ahead for killer drivers
                                                                                                               Life term ahead for killer drivers
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          Buses racing to pick up passengers has resulted in a number of accidents in the city. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Drivers involved in fatal accidents may soon be punished with life imprisonment if a police probe reveals they could have averted the mishaps.        
	The state has decided to amend rules and charge killer drivers with culpable homicide not amounting to murder (IPC Section 304)  a non-bailable offence carrying a maximum punishment of life imprisonment  following the recommendation of a seven-member committee.        
	The proposed amendment to the rules will be effected soon after the Lok Sabha polls, said a source in the government.        
	The practice now is to book drivers accused of causing fatal accidents under IPC Section 304A (death caused by negligence or rash driving). The bailable offence is punishable with up to two years in jail.        
	The panel, headed by home secretary Ardhendu Sen, has suggested that the police appoint an investigating officer immediately after a mishap is reported. The officer will have to visit the accident site at the earliest and file a report within 24 hours.        
	According to the panels recommendation, the accused driver will have to be charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder if the report states that he could have averted the accident. If convicted, the driver could be sentenced with life imprisonment, said the source.        
	But if the officer finds the driver had no role in the mishap, which was caused by other reasons such as bad condition of the road or the negligence of the victim, no penal charges will be slapped on him.        
	Officials cited two reasons for the governments decision to set up the seven-member committee. While hearing bail pleas of accused drivers, the high court has on several occasions observed that the accused should be tried under IPC Section 304, instead of Section 304A.        
	The other reason was the rise in the number of fatal road accidents caused by rash driving, including buses dangerously overtaking one another, said an official.

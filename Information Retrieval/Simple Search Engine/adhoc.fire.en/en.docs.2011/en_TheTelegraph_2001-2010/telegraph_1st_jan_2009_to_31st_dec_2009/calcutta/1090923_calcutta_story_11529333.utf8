The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Surgeons fix girls torn arm
                                                                                                               Surgeons fix girls torn arm
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The right arm of a 12-year-old girl, torn from the elbow in a washing machine accident, has been reattached after a series of complicated surgeries in a private hospital.        
	A fortnight after she lost her arm, Sahil Lodhi, a Class VI student of Ling Liang High School in Bowbazar, was all smiles as doctors vouched that she would be able to write exams with her right hand within a year.        
	As soon as they remove the plaster, I would be able to go to school, the girl told Metro from her hospital bed on Tuesday.        
	On September 13, her arm had been yanked off when she inserted it into a washing machine and switched on the power while fiddling with the buttons.         
	In such cases, it is imperative that blood circulation to muscles in the severed portion is resumed within three hours, said Anupam Golash, a reconstructive surgeon at the Calcutta Medical Research Institute (CMRI), who headed the team that treated Sahil.        
	Fortunately, her mother Amna took her to hospital on time. I was rushing out with my girl leaving the severed part of the arm in the washing machine. Some neighbours said we ought to take it to hospital, so I put it in a plastic bag and headed to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, said Amna.        
	Doctors at the hospital had only offered to dress up the wound when Amnas brother was able to contact Pervez Iqbal, an orthopaedic surgeon at the CMRI who asked them to take the child there.        
	The first surgery started within two hours of the mishap. Blood circulation to the severed portion was restored in two-and-a-half-hours after fixing the fractured upper arm bone, said Golash.        
	Sahil will have to spend another 10 days in hospital. Later, the scars will be removed through cosmetic surgery, added Golash.

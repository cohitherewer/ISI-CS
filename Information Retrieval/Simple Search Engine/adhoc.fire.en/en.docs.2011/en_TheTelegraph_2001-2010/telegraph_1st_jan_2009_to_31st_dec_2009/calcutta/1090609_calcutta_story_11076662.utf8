The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Dance floors starved of Bolly beat diet
                                                                                                               Dance floors starved of Bolly beat diet
  Nightclubs breathe easy after plex-producer war ends, signalling return of Hindi hits										      POULOMI BANERJEE                        HERE WE GO AGAIN: Kareena Kapoor in Kambakkht Ishq will lead the return of Bolly beats                                        
	The end of the Bollywood drought at the multiplexes this Friday will bring a spring to the step of the nightclubs. For, just as Calcutta cannot do without its diet of Bolly films, it just cannot jive without fresh Bolly beats.        
	Genda phool of Delhi-6 was the last hit we had, before Bollywood went off screen. Starved of Bolly releases, we have had to work intelligently to ensure that the crowd gets to hear something fresh, said DJ Harish.        
	If the winter belonged to Desi girl and Bachna ae haseeno, the spring to Oscar-winning Jai ho and then Genda phool, with Oye Lucky and Singh is Kingg thrown in along the way, the nightclubs were getting desperate for new Bollywood hits to rain down this monsoon.        
	Some DJs have been rewinding to Pappu Cant Dance and Jab We Met tracks, while others have been desperately scrounging for new remixes, like the one of Masti ki pathshala from Rang De Basanti. DJ Kunal has been busy trying to download fresh mixes to offer a new sound.        
	The title track from the Bipasha Basu-Neil Nitin Mukesh starrer Aa Dekhen Zara (that released just before the plex-producer war) was not such a big hit, but we have a remix of the original track, which is a rage, said DJ Vishal, who has been forced to change his 50:50 formula to 60:40 in favour of international over Bollywood. Enrique, Black Eyed Peas and Pussycat Dolls are the favourites.        
	In the absence of Hindi hits for nine Fridays, Punjabi hip hop also made a comeback, stretching from Delhi sounds to UK music like Juggy D and Rishi Rich.        
	Some nightclubs tried to fill in the Bolly blank with live electronica, led by Jalebee Cartel and Medieval Punditz. We had a full house of 250-300 people when we had Jalebee Cartel at Shisha, said DJ Girish. The house was also packed when the group rocked Roxy. Medieval Punditz drew in the crowds at both Roxy and Tantra.        
	With the party people getting restive about no new Bollywood on the dance floor, nightclubs are glad that Hindi blockbusters will be back at the plexes this weekend. Now, all ears are on Kambakkht Ishq and Kameenay.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | RPF nailed in platform death probe
                                                                                                               RPF nailed in platform death probe
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	The CID has started a case against four Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel for alleged criminal negligence leading to the death of an 18-year-old boy they had arrested for loitering on a platform last year.        
	Tarun Dey, drugged and robbed while travelling by train from Jaipur to Calcutta, was still drowsy when the four RPF men found him at Sealdah station and put him in lock-up. They freed him on a personal risk bond after the youth repeatedly mumbled that he was ill.         
	Tarun, a resident of Dakshin Gangadharpur in Hooghly district, was found dead on one of the platforms the next day  January 12, 2008.         
	 They should have taken Tarun to hospital instead of arresting him. Worse still, the policemen released him on a personal risk bond when he complained of illness, a CID officer said.        
	The four accused RPF personnel are sub-inspectors Bachha Acharya and Samir Sarkar and assistant sub-inspectors Arvind Prasad Roy and Ram Sundar Prasad.         
	The CID investigation into Taruns death was ordered by Calcutta High Court after the youths father, Becharam Dey, filed a petition seeking a probe.         
	We will submit the chargesheet to the court shortly, said P. Nirajnayan, the inspector-general (II) of the CID.        
	Tarun used to work in a jewellery shop in Jaipur and was making a trip home for a few weeks when tragedy struck. On January 11, Dey reached Sealdah station to receive his son but did not find him alighting from the train.         
	Dey immediately reported his sons disappearance to Government Railway Police at Sealdah, which allegedly made no effort to trace the youth. The family was informed about Taruns death the next day.        
	According to CID officials, Tarun arrived by the train he was booked on but was possibly unconscious when the engine chugged into the station.        
	That is why his father missed him. He may have been in a stupor even after alighting and the four RPF personnel simply didnt bother to check whether he was a victim of a drug-and-rob gang, an officer said.        
	The official reason for Taruns arrest was that he wasnt carrying either a train or a platform ticket and was unable to answer the RPFs personnels questions properly. The youth complained about illness throughout the period he was in custody but the RPF team was unmoved. They apparently freed him only when he was close to death, the officer said.

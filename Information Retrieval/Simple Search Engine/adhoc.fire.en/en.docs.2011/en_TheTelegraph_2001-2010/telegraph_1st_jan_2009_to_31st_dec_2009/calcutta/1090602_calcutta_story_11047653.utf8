The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pricey condos hit pause button   Streamline to sell
                                                                                                               Pricey condos hit pause button   Streamline to sell
  - Realtors revise plan and push mid-range flats to beat meltdown blues										      SUBHRO SAHA      
	Fancy condominiums are out, functional flats are in.        
	The realty slowdown has forced builders to return to the drawing board and re-launch projects in more affordable price brackets.        
	A host of real estate developers, hit by slow offtake in the creamy layer, have scrapped high-end condominium plans, settling for mid-range flats instead to beat the meltdown blues and inject some momentum in the market.        
	Bengal Unitech Universal, developing the 100-acre Uniworld City in New Town, Rajarhat, has revised plans and re-launched a 10-acre parcel, offering apartments in the Rs 25 to 35-lakh band. The Unitech Vistas project offering nearly 850 units in the 925-1,225-sq ft range, is a departure from the groups credo of creating large, luxury condos.        
	The PS Group has gone one better, offering flats in its Ixora project, also in Rajarhat, for Rs 10 to 21 lakh, while Tata Housing has made an impact with its low-cost brand Shubh Griha. The Calcutta Riverside project by the Hiland Group is also set to open a fresh flank in its upcoming 262-acre integrated township, Elgin, hawking apartments in the Rs 17 to 25-lakh range, heeding the growing demand in that segment.        
	Calcutta as an economy is creating more consumers in the 25 to 40-lakh bracket than consumers in the 50 lakh-plus bracket and in the absence of speculator/investor money, the maximum movement will happen in the lower segment in the coming 12-18 months, says Abhijit Das of property consultants Lemongrass Advisors.        
	Pradip Chopra of the PS Group agrees there is growing demand in the mid-rung and admits that developers have under-served this category for years, concentrating on the high end of the spectrum. More than 60 per cent of the housing demand in and around the city lies in the middle segment and is growing. Besides, theres an oversupply situation in the high end and the consumers borrowing capacity has shrunk. So the focus has swung to affordable housing, says Chopra.                          
	Few new branded projects launched in 2007-08 had flats below 1,500-1,700square ft for a 3-bedroom configuration, pushing the price past 50-60 lakh. This priced out a majority of home-seekers, but realtors were too busy smiling all the way to the bank to notice in the 2004-2008 peak period.        
	The downturn has sent developers scrambling to rationalise and streamline. Tata Housing last month sold 175 flats by launching smaller flats without compromising on the overall consumer offering, says Das of Lemongrass.        
	Brotin Banerjee, managing director and CEO of Tata Housing, attributed it to thorough and extensive research and development.        
	Bengal Unitech Universal, which had had its grandiose 100-acre Uniworld City designed by the UK-based firm of RMJM, has now fallen back on in-house expertise to create the Vistas project, in a clear concession to the vernacular context and the ground reality.        
	Around the city, more developers are falling in line to offer pocket-friendly flats without compromising on basic aspiration points of the consumer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 8-yr-old injured in blast
                                                                                                               8-yr-old injured in blast
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	An eight-year-old boy was injured when a crude bomb kept in a polythene bag went off in Jorabagans Karfarma Lane on Wednesday afternoon.        
	Abhisekh Dutta, his right hand coated with blood, was rushed to Medical College and Hospital. The explosion occurred around 4.20pm when the Class IV student, who was playing with his friends, touched the polythene bag dumped outside a club.        
	I rushed out on hearing the explosion and saw Abhisekh writhing in pain, his right hand bleeding, said Somenath Banerjee, who lives in a first-floor apartment opposite the club.        
	A team from Jorabagan police station searched the club and later seized a crude bomb lying outside in a polythene bag. A probe revealed that some political activists had brought the bombs a few days before the May 13 election. We are trying to track them down, said an officer.

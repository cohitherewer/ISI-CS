The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Day care for memory malady 
                                                                                                               Day care for memory malady 
  - Healing through games and interaction at Jadavpur centre          MOHUA DAS                                    
	Subrata Raha, in his 60s, would often forget where he kept his car key till one day he couldnt remember what the key was meant for. Mita Dutta, a middle-aged homemaker, often has trouble finding her way back home from the market while septuagenarian Sanket Guha kept his watch in his refrigerator.        
	People suffering from debilitating memory loss like Raha, Guha and Dutta now have a specialised care unit to turn to in the city.        
	Tucked in a quiet lane in Jadavpur, The Dementia Daycare Centre seeks to provide a secure and comfortable environment for those suffering from memory impairments. It is the latest addition to the Cochin-based Alzheimers and Related Disorders Society of Indias Calcutta chapter, founded by Shefali Chowdhury in 1999 after her daughter was detected with Alzheimers.         
	Described as a syndrome or a collection of symptoms caused by different diseases of the brain including Alzheimers, dementia is progressive degeneration of the brain, which is irreversible.        
	Medicines can only slow down the degeneration to a certain extent but an important aspect of handling dementia is specialised care-giving, says Nilanjana Maulik, the secretary and director (dementia services) of the societys city chapter.         
	The centre, set up in Regent Estate last July, spreads across three spacious rooms and an adjoining lawn. It runs on donations and contributions by individuals and patients families.        
	The most important part of dementia care is dealing with behavioural and psychological problems peculiar to each case. The day care centre tries to engage patients in activities that they might have difficulties pursuing at home, says N.N. Sarangi, the neurologist and president of the societys city chapter.        
	Trained staff members and volunteers from varied backgrounds guide the 11 dementia patients who spend time at the centre from 10am to 4pm. We greet them warmly once they come in and discuss current topics over tea and biscuits. After a session of physical exercises, theyre served lunch. We then play mentally stimulating games and ask the patients to reminisce about special moments in their lives, says Maulik.         
	The activity roster also includes yoga, meditation, laughter sessions and massages and outdoor games. The objective is to stimulate the brains of the patients and let them be part of normal life.        
	The centre focuses on a persons existing abilities instead of what he has lost. We dont force patients to remember what they cant. If someone has trouble buttoning his shirt, we give him different buttons to play with. It helps improve finger, eye and colour co-ordination, says Maulik.        
	There is a growing awareness about the disease and more people want to enrol at the centre. We plan to start more centres across the city by next year, she adds.

	 Thank you for the report Style Bolly Vs Style Tolly, May 14. I wonder why the Election Commission chose to put the indelible ink mark on the middle finger of Mumbaikars while inking the index fingers of voters in the rest of the country, which is the usual practice. Amitabh Bachchan, Abhishek and Aishwarya raising the middle finger to reveal the vote mark looked obscene (picture right). Sonam Kapoor and Hrithik Roshan were careful to hold up all the fingers so as not to offend people.           
	This was gross injustice to the voters of Mumbai as it made it difficult for them, except the Bachchan family, to show the marked finger proudly while people in other areas displayed their index fingers without any problem. Could the Election Commission throw some light on this unusual happening? I feel only one finger must be fixed for inking. Any deviation may be misused since elections are held in many phases across the country.           
	Govind Das Dujari,
  Behala                          How green is the red citadel: Employees of Writers rsquo; Buildings celebrate the Trinamul Congress rsquo;s poll victory on May 18. A Telegraph picture       
	 Apropos Green victory lap in red fort May 19, the Trinamul Congress and Congress are rejoicing the unexpected election results, but once the euphoria settles down, the two parties will have to devote some time to improve union activities at the state secretariat and other government offices. They will have to tell the union leaders to work honestly and in an transparent manner so that the peoples confidence is restored in the government machinery.             
	This would also improve the functioning of state offices and help the Trinamul and Congress do better in future panchayat polls and the next Assembly polls.           
	A.S. Mehta,

	 It is a matter of great happiness that Marxists have been defeated in the Lok Sabha polls in Bengal. The victory of the Congress and Trinamul Congress, especially Mamata Banerjee, is a momentous occasion throughout Bengal and the country.           
	But we, the voters, are apprehensive that Mamata Banerjee might resign her post as MP in a fit of anger in the coming days.           
	We request Didi not take any hasty decisions.           
	Vijay Kumar Lunia,
  Nundy Street       
	I enjoyed reading Two sides of the celeb divide, May 18, particularly The Aftermath.             
	I would like to ask actor Sabyasachi Chakraborty what he meant by minority cross-voting. Do Muslims owe the CPM any allegiance?           
	Chameli Pal,
  Batanagar                               
	 My compliments to Metro for highlighting the case of Sachin Halder, whose Tata Safari was seized for election duty. In spite of the high courts order to return the vehicle to its owner, the sub-divisional officer of Canning continued to use the car till the last day of poll duty.             
	It is really sad that law enforcers are the first to break the law. If an SDO does not follow the high courts order, how can they expect the common people to follow the courts verdict. This election has set a bad precedent.           
	Sanjay Agarwal,

	 Apropos Theres a will, theres a vote, May 14, I would like to add my mother Buloo Duttas name to the list of heroic voters. My mother suffers from hemiparesis after a cerebral thrombosis attack. But she was determined to exercise her ballot. On May 13, she was carried to booth No. 151 in Calcutta North constituency by our neighbours on a stretcher for casting her vote.             
	Kaushik Dutta,
  Address not mentioned                               
	 Apropos Blame it on local warming April 29, it is a matter of great concern that local warming rather than global warming is mainly responsible for 2009 facing the hottest April in six decades.             
	Indiscriminate felling of trees by promoters leads to an increase in carbon dioxide in the air. Filling up of wetlands and tanks for building concrete structures destroys the ecological balance of an area. A rise in the number of vehicles also plays an important role in raising the local temperature. The government cannot remain a mute spectator. General awareness to protect the greens is essential. Also, those harming the ecology should be sentenced to rigorous imprisonment to set an example.           
	Asok Kumar Chatterjee,
  Konnagar, Hooghly                     
	 There is a general belief that this April was the hottest in the last six decades because of the mindless conversion of agricultural fields to residential and commercial complexes, illegal felling of trees and filling up of water bodies, including ponds.   
	All these factors were responsible for the unusually high temperatures and absence of Norwesters this April.           
	One only hopes Buddhababu realises the price we have to pay for mindless industrialisation. Unless ecological balance is maintained during the regime of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, we will have skyscrapers like Singapore and industries like in Ruhr, but the people will have no water, no vegetables and no wheat and rice in the not-too-distant future.           
	A. Mehta,
  New Alipore                     
	 To the question What do you blame for your suffering this summer, posed by Metro on April 28, my answer is: along with increasing atmospheric pollution that is choking the city, frequent power cuts have compounded the woes of hapless citizens. The governments promise to generate enough electricity or ensure uninterrupted power havent borne fruit.           
	P.B. Saha,
  Salt Lake                      
	 The Calcutta Chief Justices stern rebuke to unscrupulous attorneys who deliberately delay court proceedings by praying for adjournments on flimsy grounds came as a pleasant surprise. The trust of the ordinary citizen in the judicial system is dwindling for more reason than one (Chief justice rap for tardy lawyers, March 28). The Chief Justice of Delhi High Court recently said that with the way things stand at present, it might take 466 years to conclude all the pending cases. As the Calcutta Chief Justice has indicated, taking endless adjournments by devious lawyers is a routine affair in India. Unfortunately, most judges dont reprimand such lawyers.             
	Kunal Saha,

	 Apropos BA bids bye to city of low yield, March 28, as a traveller on a British Airways flight to Calcutta from New York (March 14), I can appreciate the reason behind the pullout. On my flight, the aircraft was around 35% full, and the business class was almost empty. Emotions apart, this was the only decision BA could have taken. Air traffic to Calcutta is seasonal, peaking around the Pujas and winter. There is very little business travel to and from the city, hence it is difficult to load flights consistently round the year. Cities like Bangalore and Hyderabad have overtaken Calcutta as business destinations and therefore merit more frequent service.

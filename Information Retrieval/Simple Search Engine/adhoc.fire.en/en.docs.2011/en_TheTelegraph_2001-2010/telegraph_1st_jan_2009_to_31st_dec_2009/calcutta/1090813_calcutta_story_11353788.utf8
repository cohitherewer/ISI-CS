	The first Audi dealership in Calcutta is set to open by the end of the year, setting the stage for an all-German battle in the super luxury segment.         
	Audi India appointed Mohan Motors, which runs a Maruti and a Mahindra dealership in the city, as its exclusive dealer in Calcutta.        
	We have received the Letter of Intent from Audi India, said Sandeep Bajaj of Mohan Motors.        
	The showroom and an adjoining workshop will come up at 9 AJC Bose Road.         
	The plot has been purchased and we are trying to ready the dealership in two to three months, said Bajaj.        
	The premium brand from the Volkswagen group will follow German counterparts Mercedes and BMW as well as models from its parent company into the city.         
	The Audi showroom was supposed to open in January last year. Imperial Auto, which was initially selected for the dealership, backed out later.        
	Mohan Motors is upbeat about the market. It will showcase the entire Audi line, including the A4, A6 and A8 sedans, the crossover Q5, the SUV Q7 and the sports car TT Coupe, with prices ranging from Rs 44 lakh to Rs 1.4 crore.         
	Audi India managing director Benoit Tiers said: Audi is very proud to have arrived in Calcutta, the gateway to the east.        
	He added: Audi has sold 821 cars in India in the first six months of the year. The projected sales for the year is 1,500.        
	About the eastern market, Tiers said: There is a lot of interest among customers in Calcutta and we acknowledge the potential of the eastern India market. Therefore we decided to come here at the earliest opportunity.

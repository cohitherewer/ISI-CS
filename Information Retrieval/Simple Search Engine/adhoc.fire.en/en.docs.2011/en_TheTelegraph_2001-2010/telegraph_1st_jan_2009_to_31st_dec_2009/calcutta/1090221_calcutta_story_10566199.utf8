The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Kidney kingpin in cop net
                                                                                                               Kidney kingpin in cop net
  - Delhi-based accused picked up from a Sunderbans village          A STAFF REPORTER                                          
	The alleged kingpin of the kidney racket unearthed in the city early this month was arrested in a Sunderbans village late on Thursday.        
	Police said Manik Chowdhury had fled his Badarpur home in Delhi and moved into a hideout in Daudpur, Sandeshkhali, shortly after the lid was blown off the racket with the arrest of two suspected touts at Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals on February 2.        
	Anjana Pradhan, with whom Manik had been staying in Daudpur, has also been arrested.        
	A three-member team from the detective department  comprising sub-inspectors N.C. Muhuri and Shyamal Biswas and Ujjal Roy  reached Daudpur on Thursday night after travelling on a mechanised cycle-van for over an hour and crossing a river on a police boat.        
	Manik, alias Partha, must have got a hint of the raid when the team knocked on Anjanas door and so he slipped out of the bedroom. The cops later found him in a cowshed behind the house, said an officer of the detective department.        
	The key accused had earned lakhs by masterminding more than 45-50 illegal kidney transplants from 2006-08. He got involved in the racket after selling one of his kidneys in Chennai for Rs 1 lakh in 2005, he added.        
	The sleuths said Manik functioned in two ways. He would either mediate a deal involving the donor, the patients family and the hospital representative or would put in an advertisement in a newspaper seeking a kidney and then strike a deal with the donor on behalf of the patients family.        
	Though most of his touts and donors were from Calcutta and its suburbs, Manik had links across the country and was involved in illegal transplants in Bangalore, Coimbatore, Delhi and Chennai.        
	In Calcutta, the sleuths said, the racket was active in four private hospitals.        
	Manik, originally from Mukundapur off the Bypass, worked as a land broker for a few years after clearing Madhyamik in 1988.        
	He cheated a few people in land deals before disappearing from the city in 2005, said an officer.        
	A preliminary probe revealed that Anjana, in her mid-20s, would sign the documents as a family member of the donor and had even turned up at Swasthya Bhavan several times during verification.

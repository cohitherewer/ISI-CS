The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Downturn toll on eateries 
                                                                                                               Downturn toll on eateries 
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Techies are staying away from Sector V restaurants                                  
	Pritam Banerjees (name changed) workweek would not be complete without at least two lunches at Red Hot Chilli Peppers. For the past two months, the 33-year-old techie has not set foot in the Sector V restaurant. Not because of work pressure, but as a result of the downturn.        
	I used to spend around Rs 300 on lunch. With my job under threat and no increment in sight, spending so much on food seems an extravagance, said Banerjee, who works for a top software company.        
	The pocket pinch is being felt at the billing counters of Sector V food stops as well.        
	Azad Hind Dhaba, which opened its Sector V outlet four years ago, has recorded a drop in sales.        
	Tandoori dishes and dals were our most popular items. Today, rolls have taken their place. The effect of the meltdown on tech companies is affecting our business too, said an employee of the dhaba.        
	Our clientele comprises almost entirely of IT employees and there has been a steady decrease in footfall since Durga puja, said Suvomoy Pal, the manager of the Red Hot Chilli Peppers outlet.The restaurants popular corporate buffet has taken a hit.        
	Nightclubs havent fared any better. Our members used to drop in once every night after finishing work. The business that we got from Sector V was so good that we stopped promoting the club to other groups. Now only the odd techie couple drops in, said a DJ in a township nightclub.         
	Footfalls havent decreased in smaller eateries like Subway but the bill amounts have. Customers used to order Rs 140-175 per head but individual bills would not cross Rs 75 now, said Raja Menon, the manager of the Subway outlet at Sector V.        
	Coffee shops have been the least affected. If some customers have gone away because of recession, others, who used to frequent bigger restaurants, are visiting us because we are pocket-friendly, said the manager of a Barista outlet at Sector V.        
	An employee of a Caf Coffee Day echoed him.        
	The crowd from Sector V, the biggest sip-and-swing brigade in town, has also cut down on parties.         
	Parties by Sector V companies have come down by 60 per cent. There has been a considerable drop in individual spending. Average billing has gone down almost 40 per cent, said Bunty Sethi of Venom.

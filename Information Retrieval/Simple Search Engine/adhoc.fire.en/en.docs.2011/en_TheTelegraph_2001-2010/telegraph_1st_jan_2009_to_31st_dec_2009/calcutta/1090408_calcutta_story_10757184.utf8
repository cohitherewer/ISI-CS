The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Overseas plans on the back burner
                                                                                                               Overseas plans on the back burner
          SUBHRO SAHA                                            
	The global meltdown has forced a clutch of Calcutta restaurateurs planning to venture overseas to put their plans on the back burner.        
	We were to open a 5,000-sq ft restaurant-cum-lounge in Phuket this year, and half the construction was over. But we had to put the project on hold since bank loans dried up and the market in Thailand took a huge hit, said Bharat Dhamala, the director and chef of ABNM Restaurant Pvt Ltd, which owns the Red Hot Chilli Pepper brand.        
	The group had invested around Rs 40 lakh in the F amp;B outlet, a 50:50 joint venture with a Thai partner. The property inside the Jung Ceylon Mall, which was readying its wok to serve up Red Hots signature Caesar Salad with Shrimps and Pan Fried Chilli Tofu, now lies abandoned.        
	The downturn has scalped more munch menus being lined up by city-based food stops. The PDK Shenaz Group, owners of Ivory and Shisha, has put on hold its plans to foray into Germany.        
	We conducted a survey in Berlin and Frankfurt two years ago and found a healthy demand for authentic Indian cuisine there. We had planned an Ivory outlet in Berlin and Frankfurt, said Nitin Kohli, the director of the group.        
	The company is, however, continuing with its expansion plans in Singapore. We will roll out five Go India Express outlets in Singapore by June. Once the Western economies pick up, we will revive our Germany plans, said Kohli.         
	Some eateries are, however, striking while the iron is hot, like Speciality Restaurants, which plans to open a Mainland China outlet in Beijing and relaunch its Oh! Calcutta eatery in Wimbledon.         
	This is actually a good time to invest in property abroad since prices have crashed in the US and the UK, said Rajiv Kothari of Bar-B-Q.        
	S.K. Khullar, the president of Hotels and Restaurants Association of Eastern India, agrees. If any of our members approach us, we will try and facilitate bank loans, he said.

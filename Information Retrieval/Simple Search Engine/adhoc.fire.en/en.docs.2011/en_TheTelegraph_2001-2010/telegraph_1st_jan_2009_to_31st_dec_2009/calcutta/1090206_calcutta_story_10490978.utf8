The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 30cr for tram tracks repair
                                                                                                               30cr for tram tracks repair
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The state government has decided to repair the tram tracks on Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road, where a steel strip jutting out of the tracks had pierced the belly of a taxi on January 24, and in Behala.        
	Around Rs 30 crore has been earmarked for repairing a two-km stretch on Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road, near Wellington Square, and a 6.5-km stretch in Behala.        
	We decided to repair the tracks after the accident near Wellington Square, a Calcutta Tramways Company (CTC) official said on Thursday.         
	On January 24, a jutting metal strip had pierced the taxis undercarriage, punctured its rear seat and entered the boot, missing the lone passenger and the driver by inches.        
	Metro had published reports on the death traps caused by damaged tram tracks.        
	Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty and CTC chairman Rajdeo Goala had met finance minister Asim Dasgupta to request for Rs 30 crore for the repairs.         
	We were assured that funds would not be a problem for repairing the tram tracks, said Goala.         
	The tracks on some other routes, too, would be repaired in the next few months, said Pradip Chattopadhyay, the managing director of CTC.         
	Buses to be replaced: The government will buy 25 low-floor air-conditioned buses next month for plying in the city as part of its exercise to phase out commercial vehicles older than 15 years, the transport minister said on Thursday.        
	The buses will be bought from Ural India Ltds manufacturing unit in Haldia, set up with Chinese collaboration. Each bus will cost around Rs 25 lakh.        
	Asked about the fares on the new buses, Chakraborty said: The fare structure will not be much higher than what is followed on existing buses.

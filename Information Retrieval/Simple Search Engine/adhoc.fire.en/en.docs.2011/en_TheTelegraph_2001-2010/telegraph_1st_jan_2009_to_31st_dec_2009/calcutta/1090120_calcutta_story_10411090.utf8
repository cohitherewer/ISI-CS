                      Artistic endeavour                    With an aim to provide young, emerging talents in art with the ability to understand their own cultural context, Transit and Banglanatak dot com have come forward with a collaborative workshop and exhibition project between a group of London-based artists and some patachitra artists of Bengal. A unique initiative, it brings these artists in touch with cross-cultural currents, thus renewing their confidence and ability to further develop and revitalise their own art form.

Led by Spandana Gopal and Magda Fabianczyk of Transit and Manas Acharya and Suchismita Ghatak of Banglanatak dot com, the workshop, with its power of direct experience, will help participants understand the dynamics of culture, place and society in different environments.

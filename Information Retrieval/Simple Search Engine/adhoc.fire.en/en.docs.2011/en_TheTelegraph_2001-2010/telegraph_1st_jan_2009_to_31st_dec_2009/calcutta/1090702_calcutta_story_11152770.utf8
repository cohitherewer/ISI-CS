The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Road planned to ease Bypass load
                                                                                                               Road planned to ease Bypass load
          A STAFF REPORTER                                             
	A 3.7-km road skirting the Bypass is being planned to address the needs of the people on the eastern fringes which is witnessing a spurt in development.        
	The four-lane road will branch off the Bypass at the Chowbhaga crossing, near the intersection of the Prince Anwar Shah connector and the Bypass, and extend up to Basanti Road.        
	The Rs 34-crore project will be developed on a public-private partnership by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority and a host of private parties, including the Heritage and Shrachi groups. Work would start soon. It would take at least a year to make the road ready, said a CMDA official.        
	We have already paid Rs 1 crore to the CMC and offered to contribute another Rs 8.5 crore. The road will be a key link between Garia and Rajarhat, via Basanti Road. Within a few years, several projects are set to come up on vacant plots dotting the stretch, said S.K. Todi of the Shrachi group.        
	Among the projects coming up along the stretch are a high-end housing estate to be built by the Todis, two three-star hotels and a research centre. The Chowbhaga-Basanti Road link will also provide a new access to Kasba Industrial Complex which can now be reached only from the Bypass.        
	We have taken up the project as part of the urban development scheme. The road is badly needed as connectivity in the interiors of the eastern fringes is poor, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya.        
	It has been decided that the stretch between Chowbhaga and Heritage School would be developed by the civic authorities and work on the rest, which would involve building a bridge across Pocha Khal, would be supervised by the CMDA.        
	With the Ruby crossing emerging as a high traffic-load point and vehicular count on the Bypass rising almost by the day, officials hope the proposed four-lane road would come as a relief for airport or Rajarhat-bound vehicles from Prince Anwar Shah Road and Garia.         
	The road would not only provide these vehicles a route to bypass the Bypass load but would bring about greater utilisation of Basanti Road. For those bound for airport or Rajarhat, the new link would be a convenient alternative to the mess at the Ruby rotary,said a senior official of the CMDA.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | City awaits British power ring   Budge Budge jinx in hours without supply
                                                                                                               City awaits British power ring     Budge Budge jinx in hours without supply
          OUR BUREAU                                                           New Market in the dark on Wednesday afternoon.
  (Bishwarup Dutta)    
	The immediate solution to Calcuttas power problems lies not in Budge Budge but in the UK.        
	As the city reeled under rotational power cuts for up to five hours for the second consecutive day, and more through the night, CESC officials unsuccessfully hunted for spares to repair the unit that tripped on Tuesday.        
	By Wednesday evening, the unofficial word was that the Budge Budge jinx  the malfunctioning unit is the second one to have crashed in a week  could be broken only after spares arrived from the UK. But it will take us a minimum of 10 days to import the carbon brush slip-rings that the plant requires, a senior official said.        
	The snag-hit unit was up at 7.47pm after temporary repairs, but officials warned that its power-generating capacity would be far from optimal until all the defective components were replaced.        
	The unit tripped again at 9pm, plunging many parts of Calcutta into darkness as repairs continued past midnight.        
	CESC has procured six of the 10 components that need to be replaced, but needs four more to get the 200-MW unit to function normally.         
	Slip-rings are found in turbine rotors and often made to order. They cost Rs 20-25 lakh each and it is recommended that they be replaced every 10 years, which isnt always done, said the senior representative of a French company that manufactures carbon brushes.        
	He said Morgan Carbon of UK could be the manufacturer CESC had contacted for the spares. CESC did not issue any official statement on the shortage of spares or the possibility of the city facing power cuts for at least the next 10 days.        
	A CESC official did say there was a possibility that the city would be short of 70-80MW over the next 10 days during the evening peak hours. Rain could, of course, temporarily solve the problem by bringing down temperatures. Air-conditioners are primarily responsible for the high demand (1480MW in the evening), he added.        
	Wednesdays ordeal began around 10am, with CESC snapping power supply to each locality by turns to bridge the demand-supply gap. The 170-MW shortfall at noon shot up to 200MW by 7pm.        
	Sitting and sweating in the dark in his seventh floor flat on Southern Avenue, septuagenarian Probir Sanyal said: The generator has stopped working, the lift is shut and there is nothing to do but wait for the lights and fans to come alive again.        
	Trade also bore the brunt of the loadshedding. Apurba Kumar Dey of Blueprint, a medicine shop on Lindsay Street, said five to six hours of power cuts were the worst he had faced in recent years.        
	The generator is not of much help as the refrigerator does not run on it. We store lifesaving medicines and injections in the freezer, and it is becoming difficult to maintain stocks with power cuts at frequent intervals.        
	At New Market, 30 to 40 generators whirred almost throughout the day. Portions of the Hogg Market complex were dark for nearly four hours. We sell perishables and business takes a beating when customers dont enter the market after seeing it so dark, said an employee of Nahoums, the landmark confectionery shop.        
	Daftaurys, a cosmetics outlet in New Market, was almost pitch dark late in the afternoon. The inverter battery just ran out. We usually dont even have time to sit but we have had only one customer during the whole day. Footfall has dropped by 99 per cent, said a salesperson at the shop.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A rare literary display
                                                                                                               A rare literary display
          ON THE SPOT - BANGIYA SAHITYA PARISHAD                          Bangiya Sahitya Parishad, which has received a coat of paint. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                                  
	Raja Rammohun Roys turban, Bankimchandras chair, Vidyasagars reading table, a silver charkha belonging to Acharya Prafulla Chandra Roy and several other artefacts representing the Renaissance of Bengal will be on view at the literary museum coming up at Bangiya Sahitya Parishad.         
	With an initial grant of Rs 20 lakh by the Heritage Corpus Fund of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, the Parishad authorities plan to start work on the digitisation of letters and documents, and restoration of 215 paintings and 100 photographs.         
	The literary museum was part of the second-floor museum plan, which was inaugurated this January. But the literary museum involves digitisation, which is difficult and time-consuming. Most of the documents are very brittle and will be digitised on a priority basis, said a member of the Parishads executive committee.        
	A 3,500-sq ft hall on the first floor of the 243/1 APC Road address will have theme-based displays. We will have 30 cubicles on literary figures, including Rammohun Roy, Bankimchandra, Michael Madhusudan Dutt, Acharya Prafulla Chandra Roy. These will include their letters, personal belongings and items of daily use, said the projects consultant architect Arunendu Banerjee, of STS Systems. A 800-sq ft area will be carved out for a theme-based exhibition every month, he added.         
	A separate section will house rare books, like Annada Mangal, the first illustrated book in Bengali, and Halheds A Grammar of the Bengal Language.        
	The literary museum project requires Rs 38 lakh. We will request the ministry of culture for more funds. The Parishad may also pool in funds from its own resources, said the Parishad committee member.         
	This year, the Parishad has received an annual state allowance of Rs 15 lakh for maintenance and Rs 3 lakh for holding seminars and publishing books.         
	The Parishad has a collection of about 8,000 punthis (scrolls) in Bengali, Oriya, Assamese, Sanskrit and Tibetan, which has been excluded from the literary museum for lack of funds.         
	We will approach the National of India to grant us more money to digitise the punthis, added the committee member.

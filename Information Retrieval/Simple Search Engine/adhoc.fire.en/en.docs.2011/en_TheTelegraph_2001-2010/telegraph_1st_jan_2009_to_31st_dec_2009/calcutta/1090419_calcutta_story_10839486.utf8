										      caleidoscope                        Price matters: A food court platter				                           
	There are ways to beat the downturn and make money. A company is going around town promising help against debts, poor cash flow, loss of employment and rising monthly expenses.         
	No, they are not financial gurus with ready tips for your economic woes. They are healers who are out to provide health solutions for the after-effects of the downturn.         
	But how do they heal? Under ordinary circumstances, by holding healing camps to treat ailments like aches and pains, cold, depression, gastric troubles and the like. Debts and poor cash flow are recent additions to the list.         
	A woman, sick of the downturn drivel at home, at work and even at the beauty parlour, decided to get healed.         
	She called the number in the advertisement and asked about the camp. We provide energy-based healing, said a strict voice over the phone.         
	Er, energy what?        
	Apni er beshi bujhben na (You wont understand more than that), pat came the reply.         
	The ad said the healing camp was for free. She wanted to confirm.         
	Yes, the two-day camp is free, the lady on the other side said. But the classes come for a fee. How much?        
	Just Rs 3,000.        
	How many would invest in healing themselves when they could pay off part of an EMI with the money, the woman asked herself. Maybe if the debt is large enough.         
	Food finish        
	And there are ways to beat the downturn and make money.         
	During the countdown to Poila Baisakh extravaganza of sale and more sale, an east Calcutta mall announced big discounts at almost every store. Not just on brands  the price of movie tickets was heavily slashed too and in a first-of-its kind offer, even the rates at the food court had been cut down to an absurd low.         
	A family of three, after much shopping, headed for the food court for dinner. The mother and daughter went off to select the right food from the right counter, while the patriarch stood in the long queue at the cash counter to speed up matters. But the tandoori place, the Chinese and north Indian cuisine counters had already closed down!         
	The reason became clear when the patriarch joined them within minutes. The food court is closed! he cried. But why? asked the daughter. Isnt it supposed to be open till 11? Theres no food left. More lights were switched off as he spoke.         
	Offer the right discount, and even the biggest restaurants will run out of food, downturn or no downturn. Last seen, the unhappy family was making their way to a fast food counter on the ground floor, where the length of the queue suggested that they would not get a bite before midnight.

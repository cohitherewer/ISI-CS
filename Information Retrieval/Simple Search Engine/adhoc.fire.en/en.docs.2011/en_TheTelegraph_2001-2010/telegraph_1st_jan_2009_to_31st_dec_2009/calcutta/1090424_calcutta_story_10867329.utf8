The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Spy eye leads to lost cash
                                                                                                               Spy eye leads to lost cash
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Footage from a security camera outside a Sudder Street electronics shop has helped police recover Rs 1.19 lakh a Durgapur trader left behind on a rickshaw on April 17.        
	Satyapada Das, in his mid-30s, had hired the rickshaw after shopping in central Calcutta during a brief visit to the city.        
	According to an officer of Park Street police station, Das took the rickshaw near New Market to go to Kyd Street, where his car was parked. The money was inside a plastic packet that he tucked behind the seat cushion.        
	He forgot to take the packet when he got off. Das travelled quite a few kilometres on his car before he realised that he had left the money on the rickshaw and rushed to the police station to lodge a complaint, said an officer.         
	The investigators retraced the path Das had taken. They saw the closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera facing the road in the Sudder Street electronics shop and sought its footage.        
	The images stored in the hard disk showed the trader on a rickshaw. The rickshaw-pullers face could be clearly seen, added the officer. We went to the New Market rickshaw stand with the picture of the rickshaw-puller and asked the other rickshaw-pullers to identify him. We were told that his name was Budhi Yadav and he was about 45 years old.        
	Yadav, who hailed from Giridih, had left for his home soon after taking Das to Kyd Street. After collecting his details, a team of officers left for the Jharkhand town.        
	The investigators learnt Yadav had spent only a few hours at home before leaving. The officers waited for him a few days and then raided his house.        
	The entire amount was found in the plastic packet.

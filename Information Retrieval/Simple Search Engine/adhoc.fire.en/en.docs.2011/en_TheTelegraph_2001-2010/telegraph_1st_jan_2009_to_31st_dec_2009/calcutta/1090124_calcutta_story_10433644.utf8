The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mall call for post office
                                                                                                               Mall call for post office
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Stamps will now be available at the mall. India Post opened the first franchised post office of the West Bengal circle, also comprising Sikkim and the Andamans, in the Starmark bookstore at South City Mall on Friday.        
	The post office was inaugurated by Rameshwari Handa, the postmaster-general of Calcutta. This is a move to bring post offices closer to the customer. We plan to add four more franchised post offices by the end of the year , said Handa.         
	There are 9,058 post offices in the West Bengal circle at present.        
	A franchised post office, she explained, can sell postage stamps and letters, accept registered and speed post, money orders, premiums of postal life insurance and bills for private clients like electric supply and telephones.         
	But it cannot do savings bank transactions and insurance, she clarified.        
	The Starmark store, proprietor Gautam Jatia said, was starting out with the sale of stamps and philatelic items like stamp books, first-day covers and albums. A post box has been installed, too.         
	We will introduce the other services in phases. The bookstore personnel will undergo training for manning the counter.        
	We have chosen Starmark as a lot of people come here. We especially want children to come to us, Sheuli Burman, the director of Calcutta General Post Office, added.        
	A letter-writing contest was held on the occasion, where children from more than 50 schools participated.

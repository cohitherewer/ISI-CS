The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | SSKM hauls up rat controller
                                                                                                               SSKM hauls up rat controller
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The Metro report on October 13                                  
	The SSKM Hospital authorities have hauled up the private firm responsible for rat control on the premises after reports of a rodent nibbling at a patients hand came to light last week.         
	We met the officials of the company that was in charge of rat control in our hospital since 2005. They have been asked to submit a report explaining how such a condemnable incident could happen and state why action should not be taken against them, said SSKM medical superintendent and vice-principal Debashis Bhattacharya.        
	He said the hospital had also conducted an internal inquiry into the incident and sent the report to Swastha Bhavan.        
	After rats bit off a patients finger at SSKM Hospital in 2004, the government had ordered a probe but no action was taken against those found guilty.         
	On October 10 this year, Sobharani Mistri, 50, was bitten by a rat while she was sleeping. She had been admitted on September 18 to the orthopaedic department of the hospital, on the ground floor of the Woodburn Ward, with a tumour in her left ankle.        
	Mistris relatives had informed the hospital authorities of the incident two days after it occurred. A written complaint is, however, yet to be lodged.        
	Bhattacharya said Mistris tumour had been operated upon and she was recovering. Terming the incident as regrettable, the superintendent said the matter was being blown out of proportion by some sections of the media.        
	Although the incident is extremely regrettable, some sections of the media are blowing up the issue by showing the area operated upon for the tumour as the area nibbled by the rat. But the wound actually caused by the rat has already healed and is no more than a scratch now, he said.        
	Bhattacharya added that the hospital had decided to improve the general hygiene on the premises.        
	Although general cleanliness and rat control are separate issues, we have decided to improve the hygiene on the premises, he said.

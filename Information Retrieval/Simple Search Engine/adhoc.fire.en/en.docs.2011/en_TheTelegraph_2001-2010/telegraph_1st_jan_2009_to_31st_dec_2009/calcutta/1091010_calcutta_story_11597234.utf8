                                                                                                               Afghan man killed over money tiff
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A 39-year-old Afghan moneylender was murdered on Thursday afternoon, allegedly by the two Afghan brothers with whom he shared a room in a house behind New Market.        
	Police said Mohammad Barat alias Anwar was stabbed several times in his chest by Mohammad Aziz, 40, and Mohammad Anir, 19, following an altercation over division of interest income. Aziz and Anir are absconding.        
	Three other Afghans shared another room of the two-storeyed house on Market Street.        
	Barat was murdered around 4pm. Around 9pm, the landlord, Nisar Ahmed, called New Market police station after Afghans from different parts of the city started visiting the house, said city detective chief Damayanti Sen.        
	Cops found Barat lying in a pool of blood in his room on the ground floor.         
	The marks on his hand suggested that he had tried to resist his attackers.         
	The two iron chests in the room were locked. We found out that Barat often used to argue with Anir and Aziz, said an investigator.        
	Barat was a bachelor with relatives in North 24-Parganas and Assam.

                Manali Bose    Pandit Ulhas Kashalkar        Taking refuge in a harmonious world                    The concept of the Guru-shishya parampara in Indian culture has always been an important aspect of learning. The roots of Indian classical music stretch beyond five thousand years. Initially, the purpose of classical music was a spiritual one and believed to be of divine in origin, but with time, everything changed. The Guru-shishya parampara itself was fast becoming extinct when a few aficianados had the foresight to realise the colossal impact it would have on Indian music and took steps to revive the tradition. ITC-Sangeet Research Academy is one such city-based organisation that pioneered the institutionalisation of traditional training methods in Indian classical music. Now in its 30th year, the ITC Sangeet Sammelan has become an annual feature of this citys cultural calendar. In pursuance of its aims to promote, preserve, propagate and present the heritage of Hindustani Raga Sangeet, this years sammelan pays tribute to the Guru-shishya parampara, the methodology that has been used at the Academy since its inception. The two-day sammelan showcases the gurus sharing the stage with their disciples. The line-up: Vocalists Pandit Ulhas Kashalkar (guru) with Sameehan Kashalkar (scholar), Pandit Arun Bhaduri (guru) with Adarsh Saxena (scholar), Ustad Mashkoor Ali Khan (guru) with Arshad Ali Khan (scholar), Pandit Ajoy Chakrabarty (guru) with Anal Chatterjee and Deborshee Bhattacharjee (scholars). Instrumentalists include Ustad Ali Ahmad Hussain Khan (ITC Awardee), Pandit Anindo Chatterjee, Pandit Buddhadev Dasgupta (Guru) in a duet with Pandit Manilal Nag (Guru), and Abir Hossain (scholar). The inaugural artiste of the evening is ITC scholar Manali Bose (vocal), to be followed by Ali Ahmed Hussain (shenai) and Ulhas Kashalkar with Sameehan Kashalkar (vocals).

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Academy makeover
                                                                                                               Academy makeover

	From September 18, 10 theatre groups of the city will celebrate the reopening of the Academy of Fine Arts after a two-month closure for repair. But post-renovation, hiring the Academy auditorium will become dearer by around Rs 1,000 a day. Extra charges for the new lights are being contemplated.         
	Academy spokespersons Samir Aich and Ashit Pal said Rs 25 lakh donated by Mamata Banerjee from her MP local area development fund and Rs 7 lakh from an earlier donation were used for replacement of the front curtains and wings and the addition of cyclorama and metal overhead beams to hang lights. The toilets and greenrooms were redecorated and some wiring was changed. An old projection room has been converted into a light-and-sound control room.        
	Tanvir favourites                  
	After the death of its founder Habib Tanvir, Naya Theatre, the Bhopal-based repertoire, is concentrating more on reviving old favourites than celebrating its Golden Jubilee.         
	There is a huge demand to see all the plays again. Maybe someday we can also do his (Tanvirs) last play Konark, for which he had just begun readings, said Nageen, Tanvirs daughter (picture right), after a performance of Charandas Chor at the Purba Paschim theatre festival at Rabindra Sadan.         
	We will be back in Calcutta in December with three or four plays, said Nageen, who intends to pursue a career in music now that the group was under collective leadership.

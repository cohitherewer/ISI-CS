                                                                                                               Biker gangs rob Rs 4 lakh
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Youths on motorcycles robbed more than Rs 4 lakh from two pedestrians since Tuesday. Both men were carrying the money from banks on the instruction of their employers.        
	The number of such incidents in the past 10 days has gone up to four.        
	The snatchers rode up to their targets, who had come out of banks, on motorcycles and whisked away their bags, said joint commissioner (headquarters) Jawed Shamim. The latest victim was 51-year-old Bholanath Chanda, an employee of a real estate firm with an office near the Lakes. He was robbed near his employers Keyatala home at 11am while returning from a private banks Golpark branch.        
	Two youths were waiting on a motorcycle in front of the house. As Chanda was about to enter the gate, they rode up and the pillion rider snatched away the bag containing Rs 2.25 lakh. They sped away before Chanda could alert other pedestrians, said an officer.        
	We are sure that the duo knew that Chanda would come to his employers house with the money. Employees of the firm might have been involved, said Shamim.        
	Around 1.30pm on Tuesday, an employee of a private firm in Ballygunge was robbed of Rs 2 lakh by two youths on a motorcycle on Asutosh Chowdhury Lane, under Karaya police station.        
	On Monday, a bag containing Rs 2 lakh was snatched from Rana Das in the Shyampukur police station area. On September 8, Shymalendu Mandal, who works for a transport company in Tiljala, was robbed of Rs 2.25 lakh outside a private bank in Charu Market area around 11.30am.

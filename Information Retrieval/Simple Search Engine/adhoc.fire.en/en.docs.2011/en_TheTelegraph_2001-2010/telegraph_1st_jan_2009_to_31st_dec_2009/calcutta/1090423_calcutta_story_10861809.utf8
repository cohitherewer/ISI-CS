          A STAFF REPORTER                          Occupants of Mercantile Building being rescued with the help of a hydraulic ladder. (Amit Datta)                                  
	Smoke billowed out of the ground floor of Mercantile Building on Lalbazar Street on Wednesday afternoon, triggering panic among occupants.         
	Owners and employees of shops and offices got trapped on the top two floors of the four-storey building after thick smoke started coming out from electric meter boxes near a staircase, the only entry-and-exit point of the western wing of the building. Twenty people were rescued by firefighters.        
	Six fire tenders were pressed into service and fire fighters took over an hour to bring the situation under control.        
	Fire brigade officials said the smoke was possibly caused by a short-circuit.        
	According to police, residents noticed the smoke at 2.35pm. The smoke enveloped the staircase and reached the first floor. The occupants were unable to come out of the building because of the thick, black smoke and started shouting for help, said Damayanti Sen, the deputy commissioner of police (central division).        
	Firemen reached the spot after 20 minutes. We found it difficult to reach the first and second floors because of the smoke, said an officer of fire services.        
	The firemen brought a hydraulic ladder to rescue the trapped people. We set up the ladder in the north-east portion of the building and evacuated the people through windows. Since the building is old, the windows didnt have iron bars, which helped in the rescue, said an officer.        
	Traffic on the thoroughfares around the building was badly hit because of the incident.        
	The stretch of Bentinck Street between Ganesh Chandra Avenue and Lalbazar Street were closed to vehicles in the afternoon. Vehicle were also not allowed to ply on BB Ganguly Street, between Chittaranjan Avenue and Lalbazar.        
	We will investigate if negligence in maintaining the electrical wiring of the building was responsible for the incident, said a fire brigade officer.

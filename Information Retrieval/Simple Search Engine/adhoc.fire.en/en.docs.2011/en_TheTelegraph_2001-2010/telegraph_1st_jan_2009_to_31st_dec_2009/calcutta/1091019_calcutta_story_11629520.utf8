The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fireworks sound and cop fury mark a dark Diwali
                                                                                                               Fireworks sound and cop fury mark a dark Diwali     Bang goes decibel ban
  - JUST A FESTIVAL OF LIGHTS? IF ONLY...										                        Youngsters make the most of the Diwali evening by lighting diyas. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta				                                       
	The festival of lights became the festival of sound on Saturday night as the decibel ban exploded on the face of the red-faced cops who, on being hauled up by the chief minister, launched a knee-jerk crackdown around 11pm.        
	Metro wrestles the decibel devil of Diwali 2009.              
	WHAT IS THE NOISE NORM AND WHY?        
	A central noise rule of 2000 bans crackers emitting more than 125 decibel, 4 metres from the point of blast. Every state has the power to tighten the norms and in Bengal the permissible limit is 90 decibel, 5 metres from the noise source.        
	The Bengal limit was fixed in 1997, much before the central act came into force, following the recommendations of an expert committee. The fireworks brigade berates the difference in the two sets of permissible decibel limits, but on a comparable scale the difference between a Calcutta and a Mumbai is hardly 10 per cent.        
	The noise norms are fixed by scientists after taking into consideration the instant impact and damage potential from loud crackers. Loss of hearing, sudden rise in blood pressure and even cardiac arrest are feared. Children can suffer from trauma and foetuses can be affected.        
	Violators can be fined up to Rs 1 lakh or prosecuted under the Environment Protection Act, 1986, which can lead to up to five years in jail.              
	WHO MUST IMPOSE THE NOISE NORM?        
	The department of explosives is responsible for clearing the fireworks after testing their composition and noise emitting potential.        
	It is the job of the police to prevent banned crackers from being smuggled into the city  from Sivakasi in Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh, or cracker depots in South and North 24-Parganas  in the run-up to Diwali.        
	The pollution control board must monitor violation.        
	WHAT HAPPENED ON DIWALI AND WHY?        
	Bang went the ban, from Ballygunge to Behala, with highrises and para clubs playing the crackers game.        
	Diwali 2009 was the loudest in the past six years, said Biswajit Mukherjee, the chief law officer in the environment department and the high court-appointed special officer for noise control.        
	The din forced an angry chief minister out of his house and prompted desperate parents of newborn babies in BC Roy Hospital to stage a roadblock. The pollution control board and Lalbazar control room lines did not stop ringing with complaints.                  Diwali fireworks. (Amit Datta)      
	We have been receiving complaints from many different pockets, police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti told Metro soon after the 10pm deadline. (A Supreme Court directive says no noise-emitting fireworks can be burst after 10pm.)        
	Both the decibel and deadline bans blew up in the face of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and his police chief on Saturday night. But they should have seen it coming ever since the South 24-Parganas administration allowed the manufacture of noisy crackers on the pretext that they would be sold in other states.        
	Chakrabarti had written to director-general Bhupinder Singh last week about noisy crackers making their way into the local market.        
	What did his force do to prevent banned crackers from being sold and used? Precious little, apart from printing lakhs of cracker-ban posters.        
	The role of the explosives department has also come under the scanner. Many fireworks that were measured by the pollution control board were so loud that one wonders how the explosives department cleared them, observed chief law officer Mukherjee.        
	FOR THE BAN NOT TO BECOME A FARCE...          Monitoring of the explosives department in granting sanction to crackers  Proper planning and execution by the police  Pollution control board to play a more pro-active role  Citizens must follow the rules, for a change.

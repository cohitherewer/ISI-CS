The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Day of heat, power cut amp; hope of rain
                                                                                                               Day of heat, power cut amp; hope of rain
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Budge Budge is back but still not fully fit, leaving the power-plagued city around 100MW short of its peak-hour requirement and looking skywards for some rain relief.        
	To the citizens who suffered from power cuts, we would like to say: sorry, CESC said in a statement issued at 3pm to announce that its snag-hit 250MW unit had been successfully synchronised.        
	But most parts of the city continued to endure power cuts for 60 to 90 minutes each during the day. With CESC officials admitting that the Budge Budge unit wouldnt perform to optimal capacity till all defective components were replaced, the weathermans report was the only thing that held out hope for the suffering residents.        
	Thunderstorms have been forecast for Friday, which could bring temperatures down by a few degrees. The bad news is that the respite might be short-lived. The normal monsoon flow is still some distance away from being activated, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.        
	He said conditions were now conducive to thunderstorms because of two factors  incursion of adequate moisture in the lower troposphere and weakening of the dry, hot northwesterly flow over Bengal.        
	Thursday was sultry and the fourth consecutive day without a trace of rain. The mercury hit a high of 35.9 degrees Celsius, two points above normal, and the minimum humidity was 58 per cent (normal range is 40-45 per cent for this time of the year). The discomfort index rose from 61 degrees on Wednesday to 63 degrees Celsius, eight points above normal.        
	The West Bengal State Electricity Transmission Company supplied 520MW to the CESC grid in the morning and 505MW during the evening peak hours to make up for the power shortfall. CESC also procured around 112MW from various other sources.        
	The unit responsible for the power shortage is the second one in Budge Budge to collapse in just over a week.        
	Officials said efforts were being made to procure the spares required to make the unit fully functional from local sources instead of abroad.         
	The four carbon brush slip-rings that need to be replaced in the turbine rotor of the unit were to be imported from the UK, which would have delayed the process by a minimum of 10 days.        
	We are making arrangements to procure the spare parts locally. We will try them out on Saturday and Sunday. If we succeed then we will be able to step up our generation and restore normality by the weekend, an official said.

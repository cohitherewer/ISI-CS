                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Gas leak sparks cafeteria blaze
  - CTS cook sustains burns, smoke reaches fifth floor          A STAFF REPORTER                          (Top) Ranjit Sekhar and (below) CTS employees outside the office on Tuesday. (Aranya Sen)                                                
	Gas leak sparked a fire in the ground-floor cafeteria of the main Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTS) office in Sector V on Tuesday morning, injuring the head cook and causing panic among employees.         
	Three fire tenders doused the flames in half an hour. A portion of the 600sq ft kitchen was gutted.         
	Police said the fire alarm in the building went off late while firemen claimed that the windows built to allow smoke to escape were locked.         
	I was preparing a vegetable dish on one of the two burners around 9.40am, when suddenly a cylinders regulator popped up and LPG started leaking. In an instant, the room was on fire. The right side of my body was also burning. Screaming in pain, I ran out of the kitchen, said Ranjit Sekhar, the 29-year-old head cook, who sustained burns in his right hand and right leg.There were two other people in the kitchen then. The adjoining 100-seater cafeteria was nearly empty.        
	Sekhar was treated at Bidhannagar Subdivisional Hospital and released.        
	The CTS authorities termed the fire minor but the employees and the fire brigade officers felt otherwise.         
	Many of us panicked when the security guards asked us to vacate the building. The smoke climbed up to the fifth floor of the seven-storeyed building but the fire alarm did not go off. Some of us were asked to stay in the car parking area and the others outside the complex, said an employee.        
	Policemen said the smoke climbed up the rear staircase that connects the kitchen with the upper floors        
	A fireman said precautionary measures were in place but the locked smoke windows could have proved fatal.        
	Our officers broke the glass panes of the windows to clear the smoke. A security guard sustained injuries in the process, said Bibhas Guha, the deputy director of the fire and emergency services department.        
	As soon as the fire was spotted, the CTS authorities switched off power. Electricity supply was restored around noon.        
	We shifted some of our 1,700-odd employees to other buildings and asked the rest to wait outside until the fire department and the police gave us the green light. Work was not affected. The kitchen was damaged. We are inspecting what triggered the fire, said a CTS spokesperson.

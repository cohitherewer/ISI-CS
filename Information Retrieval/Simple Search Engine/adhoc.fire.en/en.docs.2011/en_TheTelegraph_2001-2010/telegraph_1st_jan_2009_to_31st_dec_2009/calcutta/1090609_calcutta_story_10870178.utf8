          SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE                              
	About 15,000 residents in six blocks of Baguiati fear severe waterlogging this monsoon as the public works department (PWD) is unlikely to complete the construction of a drainage channel along VIP Road in time. The channel, adjoining a slip road being laid between Joramandir and Teghoria, is the replacement for a canal that has been filled to construct the road.        
	The 10-plus drainage channels that used to empty into the 45ft wide canal will now connect to the 9ft wide channel being constructed.        
	The canal used to overflow during the monsoon. How will the much narrower channel drain out the sewage and rainwater? asked Avinabha Chatterjee, a septuagenarian resident.        
	The area remains waterlogged for days after a spell of heavy rain. We opposed the filling up of the canal as it prevents waterlogging to an extent. As the drain that was to replace it has not been completed, we fear the worst this monsoon, said Bidyut Chatterjee, a resident of BC block.        
	The PWD is confident the proposed channel is broad enough to serve its purpose and will be ready in time. Theres no reason to fear waterlogging, said A. Banerjee, the divisional engineer supervising the project for the PWD.        
	The local municipal authorities, too, are worried about the drainage system in the place.        
	We drain out the excess water from the wards to prevent waterlogging. But the drained water needs to be stored in the water bodies. Unless these drainage channels are completed the entire sewage system will be in jeopardy, said Tapas Chatterjee, the chairman of Rajarhat-Gopalpur municipality, the local civic body.

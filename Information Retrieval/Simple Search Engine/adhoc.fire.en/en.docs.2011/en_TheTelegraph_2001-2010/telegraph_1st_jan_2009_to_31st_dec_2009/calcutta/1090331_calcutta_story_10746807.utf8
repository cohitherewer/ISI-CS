The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Joint drive to assess workers skill
                                                                                                               Joint drive to assess workers skill
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The Confederation of Indian Industry has joined hands with the city chapter of the Don Bosco Development Society to assess the skilled workforce in the state. The two organisations recently signed a memorandum of understanding in this regard.        
	As an empanelled member of the Modular Employment Scheme of the labour ministry, we will screen assessors who will test the skill levels of workers, said Saugat Mukherjee, the regional director of CII. The scheme targets school leavers, ITI graduates and workers without qualifications.         
	The society is the development arm of the Salesian Province of Calcutta and focuses on empowerment of underprivileged youth and their families through education and skill training.        
	The CII will screen assessors, standardise assessment tools and authorise assessors to test the skills of the applicants and provide guidance for necessary skill upgrade.        
	The existing workforce is extremely stratified and this kind of an assessment will enable standardisation of the Indian workforce, said Mukherjee.        
	According to Mukherjee, many workers without qualifications and ITI graduates are skilled but struggle to find employment because of lack of certification. The workers who participate in the assessment will get a certificate from the government of India which will help them in career enhancement. We want to encourage the industry to send their workforce for assessment.        
	While the adequately skilled labourers will be recommended to the ministry for another certificate, others will be advised to undertake one of the 350 vocational training courses spanning a month and a half to three months, to be started under the modular employability scheme. They will get certificates after completing the courses.        
	These courses have the scope of making school dropouts employable and capable of starting micro-enterprises on their own, said Mukherjee.        
	The society will function as the technical arm of the process, contributing to designing of assessment tools, identifying assessors and making sure that the test centres are adequately equipped.         
	As part of their skill development initiatives, the CII has also created an industry consortium that is working with Bengal Engineering and Science University and West Bengal University of Technology for upgrade of soft skills among students.        
	The industry needs to become more proactive in training the future workforce. These are a few steps towards bridging the gap between what the institutes produce and what the industry needs, said Mukherjee.

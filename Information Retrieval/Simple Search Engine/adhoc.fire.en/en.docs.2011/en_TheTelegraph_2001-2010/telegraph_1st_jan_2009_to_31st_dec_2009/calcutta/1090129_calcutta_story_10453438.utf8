The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 7-month makeover for mela ground
                                                                                                               7-month makeover for mela ground
          SAMBIT SAHA AND KINSUK BASU                          Milan Mela is set to get a facelift by Puja 2009. A Telegraph picture                                  
	The government has decided to close Milan Mela for seven months from April to give it a much-needed makeover and a fair deal to those who pay to use the ground.        
	The government has been drawing flak from organisers of various events for the lack of infrastructure at the site, spread over 11 acres near Science City on the EM Bypass.        
	We have decided to execute the project between April and October because that is the lean season for fair organisers, Nandini Chakraborty, the chief executive officer of the West Bengal Trade Promotion Organisation, told Metro.        
	Milan Melas infrastructure problems include inadequate parking facilities, potholed approach roads, irregular water supply and erratic electricity. An inspection of firefighting facilities before the ongoing Book Fair revealed that there was not enough water to fight a blaze.        
	The trade promotion body, a joint venture between the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation, has promised to address all these issues over the next few months. The first phase of the project will be ready before the busy fair season starts in November, Chakraborty said.         
	An official claimed that the task of upgrading infrastructure would have been completed earlier had Milan Mela not been booked almost throughout the year.        
	Bookings wont be accepted between April and October so that the contracted company (Ahluwalia Contracts Ltd) can finish its work.         
	 The list of things to do is a long one, from laying a concrete road and pavement to landscaping the venue and installing an underground power distribution system. The trade promotion body also plans to set up the proposed food court by October and lease it out to private parties.        
	Completing everything in seven months wont be easy because there will be monsoon in between, a trade representative said.        
	Sources also hinted at the possibility of funds drying up before the completion of the project. But industry and commerce secretary Sabyasachi Sen insisted that cash flow would not be a problem.         
	The government will arrange for the money and work will be completed within the deadline.        
	Industry organisations backed the makeover plan. It is good to know that infrastructure will be completely ready before the next season of fairs begins, said Samir Ghosh, the chairman of the Industrial India Trade Fair.

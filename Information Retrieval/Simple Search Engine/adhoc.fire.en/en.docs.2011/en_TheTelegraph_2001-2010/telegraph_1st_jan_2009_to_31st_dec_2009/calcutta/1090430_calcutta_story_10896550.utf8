	Six tourists from Calcutta and one from Barrackpore died after the bus they were travelling in rolled into a 1,000ft-deep gorge in Kullu district of Himachal Pradesh on Wednesday afternoon.        
	Six others in the group survived the mishap, though four of them were critically injured and are being treated at a Kullu hospital.        
	Thirteen people were travelling in the bus that fell into a gorge near Sojha village in Kullus Banjar sub-division around 1pm, said M. Sudha Devi, the deputy commissioner of Kullu. The police have learnt that the victims were all BSNL employees and their family members.        
	Those who died have been identified as Ankur Pakrashi, 50, and his 10-year-old daughter Suhita; Shekhar Chakraborty, 50, and wife Amrita, 42; Archana Pal, 40, and daughter Sayoni, 12; and Ganapati Majumdar, 60.        
	The Pakrashis were from Bijoygarh, the Chakrabortys from Baguiati and the Pals from Bagha Jatin. Majumdar was a resident of Barrackpore.        
	Among the dead was the driver of the bus, Rajesh, a local resident.        
	Those critically injured have been identified as Sreyoshi Pal, 18, Ankita Pakrashi, 18, Sumona Chakraborty, 45, and Sraboni Pakrashi, 45.        
	Sarajit Pal, 47, and another tourist suffered minor cuts.        
	Family sources said the team had left for Himachal Pradesh on April 20 and was to return on May 10.        
	We came to know about the tragedy after Ankita, now being treated in Kullu, gave our contact number to the local police. Some of our family members have left for Kullu, said a relative of the Pakrashi family.        
	In the Bagha Jatin locality where the Pals lived, relatives and neighbours fought tears while talking about Sayoni. She was such a lovely child We named her Tiaburi (parrot), said a relative.        
	Majumdars friend Asit Ghosh said: Ganapati loved to travel and it was his 68th tour. He used to organise such tours with his colleagues and their families.        
	Majumdars daughter is an MSc student at Calcutta University.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Two held with heroin outside Science City
                                                                                                               Two held with heroin outside Science City
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The heroin packets found on the duo. (Sanat Kumar Sinha)                                  
	Two men were arrested outside Science City on Friday morning for allegedly peddling heroin. Police found 2.1kg of the drug on the duo.        
	Police claimed Aminul Haque and Manirul Islam, residents of Lalgola in Murshidabad, had come to the city to deliver the contraband.        
	We are yet to find out who was supposed to receive the consignment, said Anuj Sharma, the special inspector general of police of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID).         
	According to the police, Aminul and Manirul had been peddling drugs for several years in the guise of cloth traders. They used to collect heroin from Rajasthan and processed it in a makeshift laboratory in a paddy field in their village, said an investigator.        
	The two have a number of clients in Bangladesh. Since their village is close to Bangladesh, they developed contacts with criminals who smuggle drugs across the border, added the officer.        
	The cops had received a tip-off that two drug peddlers would be outside Science City on Friday morning, one of them holding a packet.        
	Seven officers were deployed in the area. As soon as the cops saw Aminul and Manirul loitering suspiciously in the area, they surrounded the two.        
	We have slapped three specific cases of drug peddling on the two. We are interrogating the two to find out where they had supplied heroin in the recent past and who were their buyers in the city, said Sharma.

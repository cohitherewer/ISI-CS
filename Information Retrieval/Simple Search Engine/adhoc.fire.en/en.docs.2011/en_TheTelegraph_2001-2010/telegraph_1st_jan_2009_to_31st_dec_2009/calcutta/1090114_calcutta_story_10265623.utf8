The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mall miss in ghost town
                                                                                                               Mall miss in ghost town
  - Kick-offs delayed by a year          SUBHRO SAHA                                                      
	Retail doesnt roll during times of recession, more so if the retail rendezvous sits in the middle of a wasteland.        
	With no takers, all large-format shop-eat-hangout stops planned in Rajarhat New Town have pushed back opening dates by at least a year. As housing minister Gautam Debs dream township continues to resemble a ghost town, retailers are wary of moving in, fearing zero footfalls.        
	Axis Mall, The Terminus and City Centre II, the three big-ticket malls announced in Rajarhat, have all missed their kick-off deadlines. Worse, retailers feel its not an address worth looking at in the next two years.        
	After the Mani Square experience, it would be suicidal to sign up space in a Rajarhat mall, warned Vijay Dugar of CS Trade Link, a franchisee for Reebok and Adidas.        
	Retailer Kamal Jain agreed. We are already struggling to keep afloat in malls at prominent locations, he said.        
	While The Terminus and Axis were slated to open by the third quarter of 2008, City Centre II was scheduled for a Poila Boisakh opening in 2007. Now, all three are expected to open in the third quarter of 2009.        
	The mall developers are, however, putting up a brave face, claiming their properties would pack enough punch to pull in the crowds, even from outside the township.        
	Axis will be a destination mall and people will drive down from the city for the experience, insists K.S. Bagchi, the managing director of Bengal Peerless Housing Development Corporation, the developers of the Rs 350-crore Axis Mall.        
	Chandan Basu, the managing director of Bengal Greenfields, which is behind The Terminus, is equally buoyant.         
	But not many are convinced, given the 12,000-acre townships image as a nightmare address.         
	Id have to be out of my mind to drive for an hour into the middle of nowhere to catch a movie or to shop when I have better options in the city, said Sandeep Ahuja, an avid mall visitor.        
	But some pin the blame on the downturn and not the Rajarhat mess. If there was a sustained growth in consumer spending, these malls could have started as destination malls despite the absence of an immediate catchment, said Abhijit Das, the managing director of property consultants Jones Lang LaSalle Meghraj (Calcutta).        
	Mall developers admit that the downturn is the primary damper, and hope infrastructure issues get sorted out soon. But by that time, they might have missed the bus, because a mall doesnt get a second chance. Remember Gariahat Mall?

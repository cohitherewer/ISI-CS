                                                                                                               Student plea against exam bar
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Wednesday admitted a petition challenging the right of the Presidency College authorities to bar a student reported for cheating during the Part I exam last year from writing the test this year.         
	The court directed the college authorities to allow the student to appear in the examination, which starts on July 6.         
	The legal validity of the resolution by the board of the heads of departments of Presidency College should be decided after hearing the case in detail, Justice Dipankar Dutta said in his order.        
	He asked the college authorities to file an affidavit stating their view in this regard.        
	The case will be heard after four weeks. The students result will be published after the petition is disposed of.        
	The student had challenged the resolution of the board of the heads of departments on April 23 this year.         
	Advocate Satadal Chatterjee, who is representing him, said: A college affiliated to Calcutta University does not have the power to formulate a rule bypassing a decision of the syndicate, the highest decision making body of the university. The syndicate does not have a rule barring my client from reappearing in Part I.        
	The lawyer told the judge that the student had moved a petition before Justice S.P. Talukdar of the same court two months ago and the court passed an order expressing hope that the college would allow him to sit for this years examination.        
	As the order of the court was not carried out, my client had moved a contempt petition. The plea is pending, added Chatterjee.         
	The advocate representing Presidency claimed the college had the right to bar the student to maintain its dignity and reputation.

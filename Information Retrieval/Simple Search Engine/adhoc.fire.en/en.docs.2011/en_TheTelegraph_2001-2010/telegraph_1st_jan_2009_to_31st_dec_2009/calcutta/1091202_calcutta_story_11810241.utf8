                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Loot gang at Law house             A STAFF REPORTER                                        A statue at the entrance to the   Law house. (Bishwarup Dutta)        
	Valuable paintings and statues were burgled from the 123-year-old house of the Law family in north Calcutta early on Tuesday.        
	The family could not put a figure to the loss till late on Tuesday as the room with the paintings and statues  that the robbers entered and exited with the help of a rope after removing a tile on the roof  is hardly ever opened.        
	They have identified eight paintings and seven statues made of brass and marble that are missing from a room on the first floor that used to be under lock and key, said an officer of the detective departments anti-burglary wing.        
	The thieves targeted the paintings and small statues and so it appears that they were aware of the antique value, said Damayanti Sen, the deputy commissioner of police, detective department.         
	The thieves reached the rooftop by climbing up a drainpipe at the rear of the building. They removed a tile on the rooftop that was directly above the room where the valuable articles were stored. They then entered the room with a rope and fled by the same route once the alarm was raised, said Sen.        
	According to the complaint lodged by resident Lakshmi Law, one of the security guards raised the alarm around 2.30am on Tuesday after noticing some moving shadows on the rooftop.        
	The house was searched but no intruder was found. In the morning, we opened the door of the room and discovered the theft, Lakshmi Law said in her complaint.        
	Law bari was established by Shyama Churn Law (1825-1891). The collection of paintings and sculptures can be credited to Lakshmis grandfather Bhabani Churn Law (1880-1926), a famous artist and a collector of art work and antiques. His collection, which includes Chinese vases, is said to be worth crores.        
	Police said there were four family members  Lakshmi, brother Subhash Churn, sister Saraswati and her husband  in one portion of the house. Another sister, Tripti Law lives in another portion and the two sides are engaged in a property battle.                    
	 The house has three servants, two security guards and six dogs.        
	Security guard Jagadish Mallik was feeding the dogs  three Spitz, two German Shepherds and one Doberman  around 2.30am when he noticed shadows moving on the rooftop and raised an alarm. The other guard, Sunil Chatterjee, rushed out and they searched the building but found no one, said an officer.        
	Another 15 paintings, removed from their frames, were found lying on the dust-covered floor after the thieves fled. The portrait of an ancestor, Pranakrishna Law, was also torn by the raiders in a rush to flee the two-storey house on Bidhan Sarani.        
	Apart from the statues, the miscreants deliberately targeted the paintings but left the 15 paintings behind in their haste to escape, said an officer.        
	The involvement of an insider is not being ruled out. They only removed that tile on the roof exactly atop the room. Apart from the two guards, we have detained two servants, Lakshmikanta Adhikary and Mozammel Haque, and the cook Anima for questioning, said the officer.        
	A neighbour said there was a history of trouble between the Laws and the people in Lohapatti in the area.        
	The Law home is a sprawling building with an andarmahal and two courtyards. The section meant for business has a thakurdalan. Sources said a preliminary scan had revealed that some old textiles and garments were also stolen. The exact list of missing items might take days to compile.  
	COLLECTION: Of paintings, sculptures and Chinese vases,said to be worth crores  
	COUNT: At least eight paintings and seven statues made of brass and marble missing from a first-floor room

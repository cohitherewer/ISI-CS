                Environment activist Subhash Dutta said on Wednesday he was planning to float a political forum called the Green Party of India. He said green parties were quite successful in Germany, Britain and Scotland and that his organisation would borrow ideas from them. He said he would meet representatives of the European green parties soon.    The family of Besu employee Hiren Sarkar, 38, who hanged himself in his Shibpur flat on Tuesday night, alleged that his wifes false complaint had forced him to take his life. Sarkar, a clerk, was booked under Section 498A on June 6 following a torture complaint by wife Mohua.    Metro services were disrupted for a few minutes on Wednesday evening after a thud was heard and smoke emitted from under a train at MG Road station at 6.52pm. The train was heading for Kavi Nazrul (Garia Bazar) station. Metro officials evacuated the train and took it to the Dum Dum car shade. Officials later said an object was found near the third rail. Services resumed after 12 minutes.    A team from the divisional forest office at Alipore and police raided a Kultali village in South 24-Parganas on Tuesday night and seized a skin of an adult tiger. Two men, identified as Subhas Mondal and Subal Mondal, were arrested. The skin will be sent to Hyderabad for a DNA test.

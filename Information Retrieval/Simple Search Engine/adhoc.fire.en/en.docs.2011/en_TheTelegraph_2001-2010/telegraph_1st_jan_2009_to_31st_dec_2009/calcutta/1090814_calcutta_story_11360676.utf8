                      False illusions of life                    Insecurity and an almost complete lack of inter-personal communication are perhaps the two major scourges of the modern civilised world. Edward Albees celebrated work Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf highlights this problem through a play that offers an unflattering glimpse into the lives of a conservative, middle-class couple. It shows how human beings suffer false illusions about themselves and others and, at the same time, are frightened of these fallacies. In the play, George and Martha invite a new professor and his wife to their house after a party. Martha is the daughter of the president of the university where George is an associate history professor. Nick (who is never addressed or introduced by name) is a biology professor (who, Martha thinks, teaches mathematics), and Honey is his ignorant, abusive wife. Once at home, Martha and George continue drinking and engage in relentless, verbal scathing and sometimes physical abuse in front of Nick and Honey. The younger couple are simultaneously fascinated and embarrassed. They stay on even though the abuse turns periodically towards them as well. Direction: Devina Seth.

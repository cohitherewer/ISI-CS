The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Space jam halts port
                                                                                                               Space jam halts port
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Container traffic movement at Calcutta Port has come to a grinding halt because of a space jam, stopping the flow of pulses and sugar and fuelling fears of yet another price rise in the local markets.        
	Shipping lines and importers said the port authority has informed them that no ship can berth at the Calcutta Dock System (CDS) in Kidderpore for the next 10 days because of lack of storage space.        
	The Calcutta Port area can store 3,500 containers but there are about 5,500 containers piled up now because of slow evacuation by trucks and trailers.        
	Exporters blamed it on the breakdown of some cranes and other handling equipment adding to the low productivity of port workers.        
	A shipping line official operating at the CDS said there are about nine ships at the dock and nine more waiting for the congestion to clear.        
	To add to the pile-up problem, the port has announced a sharp cut in navigability from Thursday, restricting movement of all cargo.        
	Port today said inbound river draft would be reduced by 0.4 metre and outbound by 0.2 metre, which would cut a ships capacity to carry 20ft containers.        
	The acting chairman of the Calcutta Port Trust, that overseas both the CDS and Haldia, admitted that some of the handling equipment that move containers from the yard to trucks were not functioning properly.        
	Anindya Mazumdar also confirmed a draft cut and congestion but denied that movement had stopped. There is a congestion and a draft cut, but that is not unusual. Ship movement has not been stopped. We are taking all possible measures to restore normality, said the port trusts acting chairman.        
	Calcutta handles about 30,000 boxes every month. Shipping lines said ships would now have to shift from Calcutta to Haldia, adding to the cost for trade.        
	For each day of delay, shipping lines charge US $8,000-10,000. The re-routing to Haldia could cost a ship another Rs 2 lakh.         
	The importer will then have to bring the cargo to Calcutta from Haldia by road, adding to the cost.        
	If the deadlock is not broken soon, prices of essential commodities like pulses and sugar could go up again in the local markets, said a trader.

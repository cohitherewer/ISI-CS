The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Son of the soil back as British diplomat
                                                                                                               Son of the soil back as British diplomat
          SUBHRO SAHA                          Sanjay Wadvani. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                  
	Enter, a foreign diplomat for whom Calcutta is far from a foreign posting.        
	Sanjay Wadvani, the new British deputy high commissioner in eastern India, was born in the city and grew up on the sweet treats at Nahoums and Flurys in the early 1970s. Back in his birthplace on an official assignment, his goal is to brand the new young and vibrant Calcutta better and help the city attract more visitors from abroad.        
	We have the worlds greatest branding and marketing skills in the UK, and would be glad to assist in improving perceptions of this state. The problem is that too few people visit Bengal, particularly Calcutta. Those who do, rave about it. Word-of-mouth publicity is important even in these days of Internet and YouTube, Wadvani told Metro.        
	The diplomat, who joined the Foreign amp; Commonwealth Office in July 1987, wants to identify the next generation of business entrepreneurs during his stint in the city, besides focusing on building bridges with small and medium enterprises that he thinks are the core strength of both Bengal and Britain.        
	Climate change is another area Wadvani wants to concentrate on. It was the fulcrum of my introductory interaction with the chief minister. We will have experts coming in from the UK and Delhi to understand local objectives and then work out proposals based on the concept of low-carbon, high economic growth, he said.        
	Wadvani, whose mother is British and late father a Sindhi who was with India Steamship in Calcutta, remembers the frequent power cuts in their New Alipore home as a kid but is glad to see the power situation improving and the roads in much better shape.        
	But what does he think about Bengals Nano fiasco?         
	According to Wadvani, who used to manage a trade and investment team that successfully helped many British businesses get a foothold in southern China, the Nano episode hadnt queered the pitch for Bengal as far as Britain was concerned.        
	British business is very practical, and there are setbacks everywhere. I feel its all about due diligence and checking out the local environment. There are always objections. Its part of public interaction with business, and both the public and business learn from these exchanges, he said.        
	Wadvani intends providing a start-to-finish tailored service to British companies willing to invest here and to Indian companies wanting to invest in the UK.        
	The diplomat, who used to do rapid laps in the Calcutta Swimming Club pool as a seven-year-old, also plans to walk the streets and interact with people to soak in the inherent warmth of the city.

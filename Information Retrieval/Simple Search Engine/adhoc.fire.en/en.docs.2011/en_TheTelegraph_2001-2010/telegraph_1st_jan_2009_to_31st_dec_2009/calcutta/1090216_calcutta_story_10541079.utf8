                                                                                                               Trouble over nurse assault
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A woman doctor allegedly beat up a nurse, sparking tension in a Beleghata nursing home on Sunday afternoon.        
	Rimi Dasgupta, in her 40s, slapped and kicked 24-year-old nurse Kanika Panja for not attending to patients, said an officer of Beleghata police station.        
	The doctor was scolding Kanika for not looking after patients properly. When she tried to argue, Rimi beat her up in a fit of rage, added the officer.        
	Kanika immediately went home, which is in the neighbourhood, and narrated the incident to her husband and family members. She returned to the nursing home with her husband and three others around 1.30pm.        
	The four started looking for the doctor in the nursing home. They demanded that Rimi should apologise to Kanika, said another officer.        
	The tension escalated when employees and security guards intercepted Kanikas husband and the other three and allegedly beat them up. The four along with Kanika went to Beleghata police station and lodged a complaint against Rimi and others.        
	Residents of the area demonstrated outside the nursing home, demanding exemplary punishment for the doctor. A police team rushed to the spot and brought the situation under control.         
	We arrested three employees of the nursing home. We will talk to the doctor before taking any action, said Tapas Kumar Ganguly, the officer-in-charge of Beleghata police station.        
	The doctor was not available for comment.        
	Trouble broke out in another nursing home, in Burtola, on Sunday after the authorities refused to hand over the body of a patient unless his relatives paid for his treatment.        
	Asit Nandan, 52, a resident of Shyampukur, was admitted to the nursing home on Saturday night with high fever. He died on Sunday morning.        
	The family members claimed the Rs-12,000 bill was inflated.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cellphone, SIM cards found in jail
                                                                                                               Cellphone, SIM cards found in jail
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Five SIM cards and a mobile phone have been found on the premises of Alipore Central jail in raids on Sunday and Monday.        
	On Sunday, two SIM cards, wrapped in a piece of cloth, were found under a brick on the grounds of the jail.        
	On Monday afternoon, three more SIM cards were found wrapped in pieces of paper in the cells of two under-trials and a mobile phone was found wrapped in a sheet of cloth in a toilet.        
	A probe has been ordered to find out how the SIM cards and the cellphone were smuggled into the jail. Showcause notices were slapped on two warders, said a senior jail officer. The mobile phone neither had a battery nor a charger. We have got in touch with the service providers to find out the call records of the SIM cards, added the officer.         
	In January, six cellphones, three SIM cards, a DVD player, a knife and a pair of scissors were seized from the cells of two undertrials at the jail.        
	The latest haul has prompted the formation of a special team that will take action against insiders who are hand-in-glove with the criminals.        
	Another officer said the department was trying to install more jammers in the jail to prevent criminals from using cellphones on the premises.

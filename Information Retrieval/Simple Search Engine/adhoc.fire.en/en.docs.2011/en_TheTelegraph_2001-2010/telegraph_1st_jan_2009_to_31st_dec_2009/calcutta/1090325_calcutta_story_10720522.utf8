The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A blanket ban on graffiti
                                                                                                               A blanket ban on graffiti
										      TALAT SALAHUDDIN      TT FOR CITY - WALL WAR                        PLACE 1 Jatin Das Road     RESIDENT SLOGAN Deface our walls and lose our votes				                                       
	There is a blanket ban on wall graffiti in one pocket of the Calcutta South constituency with a citizens association doing what even the Election Commission has not dared.        
	In Graffiti City where no one really cares, the spotless walls in the Lake Market area tell a rare story of hope.        
	A story scripted by a citizens group that proves there is a way where there is a will despite the ground reality of political might and popular meekness.        
	Over a hundred citizens comprising landlords, tenants and flat-owners in the area have raised their voices against wall graffiti.        
	The slogan: Dewale likhle vote paben na (Deface our walls and lose our votes).        
	The impact: None of the walls within the purview of the association bears any graffiti.        
	The commissions rulebook for Lok Sabha 2009 allows wall graffiti provided prior written permission is obtained from the owner of a private property.        
	This has left the door open for the political paintbrush brigade to deface walls with impunity and then produce pre-dated permission letters, making a mockery of the wall graffiti rule.                  PLACE 1 4/1B Maharaj Nand Kumar Road
  RESIDENT SLOGAN Deface our walls and lose our votes       
	The commission has to walk a tightrope in striking a delicate balance between the civil and political sections of society, chief electoral officer Debashis Sen had said while explaining why the Election Commission had broken its promise to impose a blanket ban on wall graffiti.        
	The association of citizens in Lake Market suffers from no such compulsions and so it has plugged that loophole and slammed the door shut on the face of the graffiti gang.        
	No resident is in favour of wall graffiti, so no graffiti is allowed here. It has been effective here because permission of the landlord holds no value in the citizens crusade to save our walls. Even if a political party has a landlords permission to use his wall for graffiti, members of the association still boycott that party or candidate, says Anil Menon, a clean-wall crusader.        
	The association has been at work for 15 years and has been successful in creating a clean-wall island in a sea of graffiti. In the late 1990s, a group of citizens in the locality first stood up against graffiti by whitewashing the walls of the area.        
	Adi Lake Pally and Lake Nagarik Sangha formed Citizens Association with patronage from the likes of the late poet Subhash Mukhopadhay, the late painter Paritosh Sen and the ex-director of Bose Institute, B.B. Biswas.        
	We had a series of negotiations with the political leaders of the locality and managed to convince them to cooperate. A trend was started and that tradition has been honoured for 15 years, says Amlan Mitra, a member of the association.        
	You can call it an alliance of local citizens and political leaders who have the best interests of the para at heart, adds Biman Roy, an elderly resident of the area.        
	The pressures of para propriety have forced even the most hardened politicians to see sense.        
	It is true that in this locality no graffiti is painted on walls out of respect for the citizens sentiments, says local councillor Subrata Mukherjee, whose CV as union leader and political activist carries several entries of damage to public property.                    
	The veteran, now Congress candidate from Bankura, has no qualms about his name being plastered on the walls of his constituency, but when it comes to Lake Market, he is the paragon of clean-wall virtue.         
	We want people of other areas to follow this example, says Mukherjee.        
	A tour of the area over the weekend revealed a solitary graffiti by the Rabin Deb gang  on the wall of an abandoned house.        
	We are happy that both the major political parties have honoured our sentiments, said Sambhu Saha, a resident of Lake Market.        
	The citizens group has got a pat on the back from chief electoral officer Sen. I would like to congratulate the association members who have made this possible. My suggestion to other citizens of this great city is to come forward without fear and spread this campaign.

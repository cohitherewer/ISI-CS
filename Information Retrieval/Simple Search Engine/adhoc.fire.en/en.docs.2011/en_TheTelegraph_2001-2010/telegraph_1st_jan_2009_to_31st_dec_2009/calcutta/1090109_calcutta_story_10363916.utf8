The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Runway arrest
                                                                                                               Runway arrest
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 33-year-old man, suspected to be deranged, scaled the boundary wall of the airport and entered the operational area on Thursday morning.        
	Brajesh Kumar, 33, was stopped by the Central Industrial Security Force before he could enter the sensitive zone near the runways.         
	The Patna resident was taken to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport police station, where he was arrested. He said he worked for a call centre in Salt Lake but he was speaking incoherently. It seems he is mentally unstable, said an officer. Airport sources said the boundary walls are being repaired.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | BA flight bars sclerosis victim 
                                                                                                               BA flight bars sclerosis victim 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	British Airways did not allow a 56-year-old woman with multiple sclerosis to board its Calcutta-London flight on Sunday because she was allegedly behaving in a disruptive manner.         
	According to aviation rules for people with serious disabilities, Marina Madhuparna Burman Ram was to have been escorted to her seat by airline staff before her husband Manik Ram, 59, boarded the aircraft along with the other passengers.         
	Ram, who lives in London with his wife, told Metro he became worried when he didnt see Marina on entering the aircraft. When I approached a member of the crew to enquire about my wife, she asked me to take my seat.         
	As he looked around for help, another crew member approached Ram to say that his wife was having a problem and couldnt be allowed on the flight. I was given the option of proceeding to London without my wife or disembark. I didnt know how to react, he said.         
	Ram returned to the terminal and saw his wife with a puzzled expression on her face. I asked airline officials what was wrong with her and why she hadnt been allowed to board the aircraft. They accused her of disruptive behaviour, which is untrue because I saw her in her special chair looking very calm. She would smile whenever I looked at her, he said.         
	A representative of British Airways said Marinas behaviour suggested she would be a problem on the long-haul flight.         
	The lady first said she did not want to board the flight and changed her decision later. The pilot (the captain of the flight) has the discretion not to allow anybody on board if he/she thinks the flight will be affected, the official said.         
	Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system in which gradual neurological destruction occurs in patches throughout the brain or spinal cord or both, interfering with the nerve pathways and causing muscular weakness, loss of co-ordination, speech and visual disturbances. Disruptive behaviour is not medically associated with this condition.         
	British scientist and author Stephen Hawking suffers from a rarer form of sclerosis, called Lou Gehrigs disease, but has led a famously active life with medical aids.         
	Ram said his wife was in a state of shock since the airport episode and had been put under sedation. I dont know what to do now, he said.         
	The couple had reached the airport around 1am for the 5.05am flight.

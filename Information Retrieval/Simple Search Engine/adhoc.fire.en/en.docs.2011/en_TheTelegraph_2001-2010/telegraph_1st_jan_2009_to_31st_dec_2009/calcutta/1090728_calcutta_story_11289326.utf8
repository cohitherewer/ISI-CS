	Metro Railway is likely to get the formal go-ahead for regular passenger operations on its extended line between Tollygunge and Garia on Tuesday after the commissioner of rail safety conducts the final safety inspection.         
	Railway minister Mamata Banerjee is scheduled to flag off the first train on the extended line on August 23.         
	A series of trial runs and other technical surveys have been conducted by the Metro authorities ahead of the safety inspection.         
	All the technical parameters required for safe running of trains have been checked during the trial runs and we are expecting the clearance soon, a senior Metro official said on Monday.        
	The extension, described by Mamata as a Puja gift, will take Metro Railways towards Garia but stop 2.5km short of the terminal station at New Garia. Metro officials said out of the 8.5-km stretch, trains would run for 6km till Birji station. They said it would take around 15 minutes for a train to cover the extended stretch. There is a problem of alignment of tracks in the last 2km, which we hope to solve soon, an official said.        
	Metro Railway had started trial runs with eight-coach rakes between Tollygunge station  which will be renamed Uttam Kumar  and Birji on May 28. The last trial run was conducted on July 25.         
	The trial runs were conducted to check various parameters, including the signalling system, safety of tracks and speed control, an official said. All internal inspections have been completed successfully.        
	The rakes on the extended route would be gradually replaced with state-of-the-art rakes produced at the Integral Coach Factory at Perambur, said a Metro official.        
	The expansion project was sanctioned in 1999-2000 during Mamatas first tenure as railway minister.

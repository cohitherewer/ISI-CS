The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | An open dump
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      An open dump

	An open vat on Sarat Ghosh Garden Road has led residents to kick up a stink.         
	Sarat Ghosh Garden Road, which connects Haltu with Dhakuria rail station and bus stand, is a busy road during peak hours.         
	This is an important road that connects areas like Haltu, Rathtala with Dhakuria rail station and bus stand. Scores of autorickshaws, cycle rickshaws and minibuses ply on this road, said a resident.         
	The vat reduces the roads width and accessibility, added the resident of Sarat Ghosh Garden Road.         
	Besides, the garbage often spills on the road since the vat has no walls. Dogs litter the road and the entrances of buildings opposite the vat, said Ashis Dutta, who often visits Haltu. If the authorities make arrangements to cover it on three sides, the waste will not spill over to the road, he added.         
	A senior official of the solid waste management department of Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) said there are open garbage collection points in many areas of the city as adequate space is not available to create enclosed vats.         
	Our dumpers clear the garbage by 11am every day. But the residents keep dumping waste through the day, added the official.

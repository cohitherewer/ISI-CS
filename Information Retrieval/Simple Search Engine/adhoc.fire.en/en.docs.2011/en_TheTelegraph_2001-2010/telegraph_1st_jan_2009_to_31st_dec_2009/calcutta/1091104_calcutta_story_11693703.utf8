          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	A string of setbacks in court has forced Calcutta University to consider amending its decades-old rules.         
	The authorities are examining why several judgments have gone against the university in the past few months despite the institutions laws being followed, said sources.         
	The statutes on the basis of which important decisions are taken are nearly 30 years old. The education system has changed since the time the rules were formulated. There is a need to replace some outdated provisions in the statutes, said a senior member of the university syndicate.         
	Basab Ray Chaudhury, the university registrar, also admitted the need to amend the statutes. We need to restructure some rules to make them in sync with the current situation, he said.        
	The courtroom losses that have prompted the exercise include the one against Bhawanipur Gujarati Education Society College, which challenged the university decision to not allow them to admit students beyond its approved capacity.         
	The court had also directed the university to admit 10 graduates from St Xaviers College who had alleged that they were being denied seats on the basis of discriminatory admission criteria for candidates from affiliates-turned autonomous institutions.        
	Many students who had moved court against examination-related problems won favourable verdicts.         
	A university official cited the waivers granted to Aila-affected students following a state government directive. It was difficult for us to execute the government order as the statutes do not allow the waivers. Legal disputes may arise in future if students claim concessions citing the waivers to the Aila victims, he said.

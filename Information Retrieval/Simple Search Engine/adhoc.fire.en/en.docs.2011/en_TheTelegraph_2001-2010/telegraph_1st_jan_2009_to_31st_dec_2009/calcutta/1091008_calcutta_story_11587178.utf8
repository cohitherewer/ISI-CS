                                                                                                               Court bar on state landfill
  - Plea by water body owners           OUR BUREAU                          The Chamrail wetland. Picture by Gopal Senapati                                        
	The high court on Wednesday passed an interim order restraining the state government from filling up a cluster of water bodies spread across 2,000 bighas at Chamrail in Howrah.        
	The vacation division bench of Justice A. Basu and Justice S. Banerjee also directed the state pollution control board to file a report on the true nature of the plot by October 30.        
	Till the case is disposed of, the board will have to ensure no construction is carried out on the plot.         
	The government was allegedly filling up the wetland to build a hosiery park. Former owners of water bodies that made up the wetland and residents had moved court under the banner of Jalabhumi Banchao Committee.        
	The owners alleged that the Block Land Reforms Office (BLRO) had forced them to sell their water bodies at a price lower than the market rate.         
	The BLRO had claimed that the area was recorded as an agricultural land and not as a wetland. But it is not true. The government is violating the fisheries act by turning water bodies into land, said Chaitali Bhattacharya, the lawyer who represented the committee.        
	She claimed that at least 40 residents had lodged FIRs with Bally and Liluah police stations accusing the government of land grab.         
	According to the lawyer, the alleged landfill has created drainage and environmental problems in the area.        
	The railway has been made a party to the case since 800 of the 2,000 bighas belong to it.        
	Advocate Supriyo Basu, who appeared for the state, opposed the petition and claimed that the area was made up of agricultural plots.         
	The case is scheduled to be heard again by the division bench headed by Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar on November 6.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Dozen wings to Dubai this winter   Flurry to fly to Dubai
                                                                                                               Dozen wings to Dubai this winter     - Emirates first international airline with double daily flights from town          SANJAY MANDAL                                                  
	British Airways did not find it viable to operate even one flight a week from Calcutta but Emirates will fly a dozen a week from the city this winter.        
	The Dubai-based airline, which launched its operations in Calcutta in 2006 and now has a daily flight, will have two flights a day on five days of the week and one each on the other two days. The additional flights will start operating from the first week of December.        
	This is the first time that Calcutta will have regular double daily flights to any international destination. One flight will take off from the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport at 8.30pm on Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and arrive in Dubai at 12.30am. The other flight will operate daily, taking off at 8.55am and arriving in Dubai at 12.55pm.        
	All our flights are doing very well and a market survey has revealed that there will be further growth, a senior Emirates official said on Tuesday. The airline is going for a major expansion of operations in India, he added.        
	The seven Calcutta flights are said to be recording an 80 per cent-plus average passenger load, on the wings of the withdrawal of British Airways and Gulf Air. A number of Europe and US-bound passengers, who earlier used to take BA, are now flying Emirates. Also, there has been a substantial growth in labour traffic movement, said Anil Punjabi, the chairman (east) of the Travel Agents Federation of India.                    
	Also, Dubai has been a hot destination for shoppers and leisure tourists for years. It is easier to get a visa to Dubai than some other destinations in that part of the world, added Punjabi.        
	Emirates sources said the airline would be able to add the extra flights after acquiring a new aircraft in December. To lure passengers, the airline is also offering pick-up and drop for first class and business class passengers.        
	Calcutta airport officials were upbeat with the news of Emirates increasing frequency. This will provide a boost too the aviation sector in the city which has been severely hit by the withdrawal of a number of airlines in recent times, said airport director V. K. Monga.        
	Kingfisher airline will start its Calcutta-Dhaka flight from May 15, airline sources said. Bangkok and Chittagong are next, they said.

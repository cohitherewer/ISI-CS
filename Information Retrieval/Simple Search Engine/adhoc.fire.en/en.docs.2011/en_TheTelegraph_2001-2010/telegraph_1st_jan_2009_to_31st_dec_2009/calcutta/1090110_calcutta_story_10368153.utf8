The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Roof collapse traps woman
                                                                                                               Roof collapse traps woman
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 27-year-old woman was injured when the asbestos roof on the first floor of a two-storey house on Palm Avenue collapsed on Friday afternoon.         
	Dipti Nayek, whose father is a tenant in the building, was admitted to National Medical College and Hospital. Her condition was stable.        
	Rajesh Ojha, a resident of the area, heard a loud thud from the house around 12.30pm. I thought there was a blast and ran to the building along with friends to find that the asbestos roof on the first-floor had collapsed, he said.        
	They climbed to the first floor and rescued Dipti from under the debris. She was cooking when the mishap occurred, said Pradip Chatterjee, the joint commissioner of police, (headquarters). Her father was not in the house.        
	The building, when it came up 30 years ago, was single-storeyed. A floor was added two decades back to accommodate tenants, said an officer of Lake police station.        
	Asim Bauri, who lives nearby, said residents had informed the Calcutta Municipal Corporation several times about the condition of the house. But civic employees never bothered to examine the building. They even did not put up a notice asking the residents to vacate the house, he added.

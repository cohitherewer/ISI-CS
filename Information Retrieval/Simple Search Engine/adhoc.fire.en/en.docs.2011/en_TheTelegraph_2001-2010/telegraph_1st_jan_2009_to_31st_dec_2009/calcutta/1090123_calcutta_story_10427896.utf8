The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Nightmare ride with rogue cop
                                                                                                               Nightmare ride with rogue cop
                            
	A day after Shampa Bhattacharya of Phoolbagan protested the misbehaviour of constable Dharanidhar Pati, 55, the 39-year-old homemaker told her story to Metro.        
	I boarded a Jadavpur-Airport minibus with my 11-year-old daughter from the VIP Market stop around 7pm.        
	The bus was quite crowded and we had to stand. After some time, a boy offered me a seat. I sat down with my daughter on my lap. Around 7.30pm, I realised that a man, clad in a navy blue shirt, was continuously pressing himself against my arm.        
	I asked him to stand properly but he didnt pay heed. After a while, I shouted at him and threatened to hit him. Some passengers looked at us, but no one reacted.        
	When the man persisted, I lost my cool and hit him with my sandal and abused him. Some passengers asked me what the problem was and the man quickly moved away and jumped off the bus near Sonapatti.        
	I asked the conductor to stop the bus and got off, leaving my daughter inside. A few passengers, too, got off. The man started running and the passengers and some local youths chased him.        
	I went to a sergeant standing nearby and told him what had happened. He alerted Entally police station.         
	By this time, the passengers and youths had caught the man. Two cops identified him as a constable of Entally police station. The officer-in-charge of the police station asked me if I intended to lodge a complaint of molestation. I said I would get back to him after consulting my husband.        
	I returned to the police station with my husband after some time. Two constables tried to dissuade me, saying that the accused was an elderly man and that he would not repeat such an act.        
	But I was determined to teach him, and all harassers, a lesson and filed the complaint.

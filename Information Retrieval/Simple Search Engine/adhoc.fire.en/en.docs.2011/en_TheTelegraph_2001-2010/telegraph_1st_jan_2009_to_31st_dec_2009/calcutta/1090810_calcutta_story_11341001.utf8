The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Squatters halt canal clean-up
                                                                                                               Squatters halt canal clean-up
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Encroachers are threatening to derail a Rs 4.3-crore project to desilt the largest drainage channel in the city.         
	The irrigation department, which is executing the project, has informed the civic body that it would not be able to desilt Palmerbazar drainage canal from Kulia Tangra and Makalpota unless the 30-odd encroachers huts on the stretch are removed.        
	The project was supposed to be completed by August. If it isnt, the city is likely to experience prolonged waterlogging after every spell of heavy shower, said a civic official.         
	The 5km canal connects Palmerbazar pumping station, the mainstay of the civic drainage infrastructure, with Bantala.        
	Run-off water from across the city proper reaches the pumping station, which drains into the canal. If the canal remains silted, there will be back flow into the pumping station, which in turn will slow down the rate at which water recedes from the city roads, explained a civic engineer.        
	Since the canal is under the state irrigation department, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation had asked it to desilt the stretch between Palmerbazar and Makalpota.        
	There is a possibility that once silt is removed from the canal bed, the temporary structures set up by the encroachers on the embankments might collapse, said the superintending engineer of the project, T.K. Ghosh.        
	Municipal commissioner Arnab Roy directed chief engineer (sewerage and drainage) Amit Kumar Roy to take up the matter with the irrigation department and approach the local councillor for a solution.

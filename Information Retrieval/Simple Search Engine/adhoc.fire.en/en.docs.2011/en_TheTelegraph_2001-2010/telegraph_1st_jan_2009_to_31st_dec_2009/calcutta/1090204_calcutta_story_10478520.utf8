                      Portraits of two cities                    Ekta Singha is known for her life-like watercolours of people, places and events as she finds them around her. The fifth ongoing solo exhibition of her works features 22 creations depicting Calcutta and Benaras in their myriad forms and hues, bringing to life the old world charm that these two cities are famous for. The works on show belie the tender age of the artist, as much for her technical expertise in handling her medium as for her maturity in treating her subjects. Her portrayal of daily life catches the din and bustle of the city along with its busy thoroughfares, withered lanes and bylanes, quaint old trams, cottages and greenery, as well as the hopes and fears of those who people these places. Surprisingly, all her creations are diffused with a gentle pathos, as if in silent acknowledgement of the transience of life. Singha also paints the magnificent beauty of nature in all colours of the rainbow, touching inanimate objects with life.                  Event: An exhibition of watercolours by Ekta Singha When: Till February 8; 4 pm - 8 pm Where: Birla Academy of Art amp; Culture, 4th floor, AC gallery

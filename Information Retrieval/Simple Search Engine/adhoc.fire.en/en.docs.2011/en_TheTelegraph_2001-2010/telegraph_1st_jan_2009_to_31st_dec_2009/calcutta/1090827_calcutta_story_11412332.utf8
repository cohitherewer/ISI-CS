The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Victim Modi argues his case                                                                                                                  Victim Modi argues his case     - I have never met Gaffar... its impossible to acquire land with force          DEVADEEP PUROHIT AND ZEESHAN JAWED                          Raj K. Modi on Wednesday.   (Amit Datta)                                                             Raj K. Modi, the managing director of Vedic Realty, has gone from being the lord of a luxury resort and a realtor on the rise to a man the government is gunning for and many love to hate. In an exclusive chat with Metro on Wednesday, Modi tells his side of the story about the arson and its aftermath.    
	On the arms and ammunition haul from Vedic Village   
	The police did not recover arms and ammunition from the Vedic Village campus, they got it from the construction site of Kolkata Links, our upcoming project in association with the state government. As we are still in the process of buying land for the project, we havent put up any boundary wall and so anybody can access the site. Some criminals have probably used the place to store arms and ammunition.        
	On the home secretarys statement linking the Vedic Realty management with land mafia led by Gaffar Mollah        
	We recruited local people in construction work. We sourced construction materials from local syndicates. A lot of local people helped us in spotting potential land sellers. It was impossible for us to run background checks on all these people. Gaffar might have been one of the many such people. I have never seen or met Gaffar and he was clearly not on our payrolls. The home secretary was probably not aware of all the facts, thats why he made that statement. I will meet him when he is back in town.        
	On allegations of forceful land acquisition        
	Most of the plots have multiple owners and its practically impossible to acquire land with force, by using strong-arm tactics. It is true that a lot of local land brokers got sellers to us, but we always paid them the market price. You can find plots around Vedic Village that do not belong to us. This would not have been possible had we used force to buy land.         
	On the possibility of police action against Modi and his men        
	The police interrogated me on Tuesday night and I gave them all the details about the project. I have also promised to co-operate with them in the investigation. I dont know why there will be action against us. We were the victims as our property was attacked.                                 
	On having partners (like Kamal Gandhi for Vedic Village and Amarnath Shroff of Diamond for Kolkata Links) who dont have a clean image        
	Kamal Gandhi had initially helped us in buying land but then we parted ways. Shroff doesnt have much role in Kolkata Links other than getting anchor investors and the designing aspect...        
	On Sundays attack on Vedic Village        
	Some disgruntled people may have instigated the villagers and that resulted in the arson.... But it is difficult for me to pin the blame on anybody for the incident.        
	On possible reasons behind the villagers discontent and anger        
	We started buying land for Vedic Village in 1997 when we paid Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000 per cottah. Towards the end of the land procurement process, which finished last year, the rate had gone up to around Rs 2.25 lakh per cottah. Some people who had sold land earlier and at cheaper rates might have been disgruntled. Besides, we refused to buy land from those who didnt have clear and clean title deeds.... Though a lot of local people wanted employment at Vedic Village, we could recruit only a fixed number.         
	On being favoured by the government in land and other deals        
	We never got any special favour I would rather say that we were unnecessarily dragged into a court case during the mutation of land that we had bought from farmers in the early days of the project. Finally, we went for an out-of-court settlement and agreed to all the terms and conditions of the government. The government changed its approach after realising the benefits accruing to people around Vedic Village. Then, the government also agreed to partner us for the Kolkata Links project, which promised to resolve the crisis of land for IT companies like Infosys and Wipro.         
	On Kolkata Links        
	An integrated IT township with a slew of commercial options, which would come up on over 1,600 acres spanning Rajarhat and Bhangar. We will execute the project, along with Diamond Group, in three phases and it will attract investments of over Rs 5,000 crore. We will give 600 acres of land to the government free of cost while the government will create the infrastructure for the entire area. We have started buying land for the first phase of Kolkata Links.         
	On the hit that Vedic Village will take        
	All this will have an impact but we are trying our best to reopen Vedic Village within 10 days. The restoration work has already started

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Gelatine clue in slums
                                                                                                               Gelatine clue in slums
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	CID sleuths suspect that the seven gelatine sticks found in a Salt Lake-Howrah bus on Tuesday were kept in slums near Ultadanga after being stolen. A CID team visited the areas, including Muraripukur and Patipukur, to hunt for leads.        
	It appears that the consignment was ordered by the CPI (Maoist), said a CID officer. Naxalite outfits often use gelatine sticks to carry out explosions, he added.        
	The sticks, weighing 1.4kg and fitted with detonators, were found under the seats of a private bus on route 215A when it reached Howrah. A probe revealed that they were manufactured by a Nagpur firm.         
	Since elections are coming up, there is a high chance of explosives being supplied to the trouble-torn areas of the state. We suspect that someone boarded the bus with the consignment and reached Howrah. He might have left the gelatine sticks in the bus after the receiver failed to turn up, said an officer.

	Land acquisition woes and political violence could come in the way of German enterprises looking to set up business in Bengal, the German government fears.        
	Yes, there are reservations over land for industry in Bengal... but we do hope there would be better clarity on the issue, Ernst Stckl-Pukall from the German Federal ministry of economics and technology, Berlin, said on Tuesday.        
	Stckl-Pukall, who was in town with a 16-member German delegation representing marine equipment industries, admitted there was a herd mentality among German business houses, which were concentrating on more proactive centres such as Pune, Chennai and Ahmedabad.        
	Theres no denying the negative impact the recent political violence has had on the perception of Bengal among German business captains. Add to it the land hurdles, its not a rosy picture we can paint despite our best efforts, lamented Klaus Tesch, the consul and deputy head of the German mission in Calcutta.        
	The marine equipment team, however, was still hopeful of encouraging results from the partnership talks organised by VDMA, the German engineering federation.        
	Nearly 30 small and medium enterprises from Calcutta joined the matchmaking forum with the German team. The German firms are here to establish contact, look for partners and maybe, even outsource components, said Rajesh Nath, the managing director of VDMAs India chapter.

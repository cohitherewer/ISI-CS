                                                                            Tuesday , November 3 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Traffic-stoppers stray into city

	Cyclerickshaws have been plying with impunity on Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road, Mirza Ghalib Street and Marquis Street, violating a law that bans the slow-moving three-wheelers in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area.        
	Cyclerickshaws are not allowed to ply on busy thoroughfares to facilitate swift movement of traffic, said a senior police officer.         
	Even the cyclerickshaws registered with the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) are only allowed to ply in fringe areas like Kasba, Behala and Tiljala.        
	There are definite routes for cyclerickshaws, beyond which they are not allowed, said mayoral council member Faiyaz Ahmed Khan.         
	But the rickshaws can be seen on important thoroughfares in the heart of the city, such as Lindsay Street, because of lax policing. They take passengers to New Market, said a shop owner on Lindsay Street.         
	A cyclerickshaw puller admitted that he often plies along main roads if the passengers are ready to pay a hefty fare.        
	We ply in the Park Circus area, often on the main roads. Whenever the police increase vigilance, we stay off the important thoroughfares, said another cyclerickshaw puller.        
	Shop owners in the area blamed them for slowing down traffic.         
	The police should keep the cyclerickshaws off the main roads to prevent traffic snarls. Sometimes, cyclerickshaw pullers get into a scuffle with rickshaw pullers over customers, said a trader.         
	Senior officers in Lalbazar said the traffic police has a separate branch to deal with the road rule violations by cyclerickshaws.         
	The hackney carriage wing of the traffic department looks after the movement of slow vehicles. We often seize vehicles plying on roads where they are banned, said Dilip Bandyopadhyay, the deputy commissioner (traffic).         
	Union leaders distanced themselves from illegally plying cyclerickshaws. If the cops take action against illegal cyclerickshaws we will never protest, said Nirmal Majumdar, a Calcutta district committee member of Citu.

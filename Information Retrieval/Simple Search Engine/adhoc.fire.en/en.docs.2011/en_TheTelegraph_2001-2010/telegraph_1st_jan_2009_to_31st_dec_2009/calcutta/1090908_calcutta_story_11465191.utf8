                                                                                                               Monkey trail to Pune   Poachers on the prowl
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Rajesh Singh at Alipore court. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Rajesh Singh, the alleged mastermind behind the marmoset theft, had struck a deal with a 72-year-old man in Pune to sell the rare monkeys, police said on Monday.        
	Rajesh, who had also masterminded the theft of rare birds from Orissas Nandankanan and two other government zoos, had taken an advance of Rs 2 lakh from Pune-based Vivian Solesman for the marmosets, said an officer investigating the case.        
	Solesman, who allegedly deals in stolen birds and animals under the guise of a licensed collector of wildlife, could not be found when cops raided his ninth-floor apartment in Pune.        
	Rajesh came in touch with Vivian five years ago through a veterinary surgeon, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police, headquarters. Vivian is another key player in the racket. He sold many of the birds and animals that Rajesh had stolen to collectors in India and abroad.        
	An officer said Rajesh, who was arrested in Ajmer on Saturday night and remanded in police custody for seven days on Monday, admitted during interrogation that he had plotted the theft of a pair of macaws from Nandankanan on July 27 and two more pairs of the bird from a government zoo in Ahmedabad eight months ago.        
	Apart from targeting government zoos, Rajesh had also poached on private collections and resorts, said Shamim.        
	A year and a half ago, Rajesh had allegedly stolen two marmosets from a private collector in Pune, and handed them over to his aide Sujay Das in Calcutta. Das sold the monkeys for Rs 50,000 each to a man in Bangalore.                    
	The police said that in one of the operations, Rajesh had killed three German Shepherd dogs in a farmhouse in Khandala, Maharashtra. The owner had kept the dogs to guard the farmhouse. After killing them, Rajesh stole 32 macaws and parrots, worth around Rs 30 lakh, said Shamim.        
	Das, along with Raj Saikia, another member of the racket, are in the custody of the detective department. The August 8 theft from Alipore zoo allegedly was executed by Saikia under orders from Rajesh.

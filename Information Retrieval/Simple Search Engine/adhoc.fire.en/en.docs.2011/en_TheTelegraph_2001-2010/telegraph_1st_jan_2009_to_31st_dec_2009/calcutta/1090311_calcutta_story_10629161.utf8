The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Land bank   for projects 
                                                                                                               Land bank   for projects

	The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) is creating a map of its unutilised plots to facilitate execution of projects, either by itself or in partnership with private organisations.         
	Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya recently approved the creation of a land bank. It will include empty plots in the compounds of completed CMDA projects. A land map showing the usable plots will be drawn up later.        
	The search for plots started this month at Baishnabghata Patuli and East Calcutta Area Development Project.         
	The responsibility of identifying unused plots was entrusted with the special secretary, chief engineer (area development wing) and the joint secretary (marketing management wing) of the CMDA.        
	Deepankar Chatterjee, the chief engineer (area development wing), said unutilised CMDA plots were spread across the city and a land bank would go a long away in smooth execution of projects.         
	The CMDA is executing a number of projects and more are on the anvil. A number of entrepreneurs have sought land from us for projects. We could not assure them of help since we were not sure whether we have the kind of plots they need. If we had a land map, it would have been easier to process their applications, added Chatterjee.        
	He felt the land bank would prevent unnecessary delay in execution of projects.        
	The CMDA has also decided that five per cent of the deposited money will be refunded in case there is delay in handing over possession of flats to allottees. However, legal opinion may be sought before the money is released, said a CMDA official.         
	Projects are delayed because of various reasons, including non-availability of raw materials. The money-back clause will put an end to unnecessary delays, said another senior official.

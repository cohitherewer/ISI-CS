The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hundred laptops looted
                                                                                                               Hundred laptops looted
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Laptops worth more than Rs 37 lakh have been looted from two shops, barely 2km apart, off VIP Road.        
	The shops, in Joramandir and Kaikhali, were burgled between Saturday night and Monday morning. They were closed on Sunday. We suspect both robberies were carried out by the same gang, said an officer of Baguiati police station.        
	Debashish Das, the owner of Joramandirs Xeon Infotech which deals in Lenovo laptops, said he had checked the stock before downing shutters on Saturday night.        
	We rushed to the shop on Monday morning after receiving a call from an acquaintance who said the shutters had been prised open. On entering the shop, we realised that burglars had struck. A preliminary assessment revealed that 100 laptops worth Rs 35 lakh had been lost, said Das.        
	The other outlet burgled was RP Infosystems, which sells Chirag computers and laptops. Kaustav Roy, the chairman of the group, said: Two laptops and a monitor worth Rs 2 lakh have been stolen.        
	An officer on the case said some evidence had been collected and the needle of suspicion was pointing at one gang.

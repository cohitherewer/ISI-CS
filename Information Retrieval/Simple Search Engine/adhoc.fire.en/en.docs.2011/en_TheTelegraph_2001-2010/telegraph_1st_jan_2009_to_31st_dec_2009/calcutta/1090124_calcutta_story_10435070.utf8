                      Malaysian odyssey                    A free spirit and a dynamic force to reckon with in the Malaysian cultural world, Ramli Ibrahim has often been described as original, radical and non-conformist, sweeping aside prevalent provincialism with his integrated vision of arts. His Odissi choreography transcends national, religious and ethnic boundaries. In Vision of Forever, his choreographic creation, Ibrahim has selected an Odissi dance repertoire inspired by three major gurus of the Odissi tradition. At the same time, he has invested the presentation with his inimitable style, rearranging them in a compelling composition for which his group has won international renown. In tomorrows concert, Ibrahim and eight dancers of his dance company, Sutra, will present four pieces. In Hari Haro, celestial dancers descend from their heavenly abode to invoke the spirit of dance. Sthai and Pallavi expose the distinctive Odissi style of Sutra. Dashamahavidiya, the concluding dance, presents the 10 revelations of the Goddess Absolute, and is one of Sutras most popular works. Hosted by EZCC, FICCIFLO amp; Open Doors.                    Event: Odissi dance presentation by Ramli Ibrahim and Sutra Dance Company When: Tomorrow at 11 am Where: G.D.

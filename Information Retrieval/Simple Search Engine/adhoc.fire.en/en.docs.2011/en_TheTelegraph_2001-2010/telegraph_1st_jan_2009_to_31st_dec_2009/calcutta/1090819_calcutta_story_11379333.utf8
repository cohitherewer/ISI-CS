                Calcutta got its eighth multiplex on Tuesday afternoon with the launch of the two-screen Movie Time at the Mukti World mall in Ballygunge Phari. The 8,000sq ft multiplex has a seating capacity of 298 and will screen Hollywood, Bollywood and Tollywood releases. The ticket prices will range from Rs 50 to Rs 150. The Mumbai-based multiplex chain is slated to expand its Calcutta presence next year with a four-screen multiplex in Salt Lake.    Five Metro Railway contract labourers were arrested at Esplanade station on Tuesday morning for attempting to disrupt trains by throwing garbage on the tracks. The men, owing allegiance to the Trinamul Congress-backed Metro Railway Maintenance Contractors Labour Union, had started a hunger strike at Metro Channel on Tuesday, seeking confirmation of their job. The five were produced at Bankshall court and remanded in judicial custody for a day.     A 30-year-old man died after the car he was driving hit a road divider and overturned near Minto Park late on Monday. Avishek Saha, a Beniapukur Road resident, was taken to Calcutta National Medical College, where he was declared dead on arrival.    Three persons were arrested with fake notes of Rs 75,000 at Posta on Tuesday. Pintu Santra, 28, and two others named Shaukat Ali, aged 29 and 49 years, both residents of Kaliachak in Malda, were buying clothes when shopkeepers found their behaviour suspicious and alerted the cops.    Trains from Sealdah to Diamond Harbour, Lakshmikantapur and Canning were stalled between 7.30pm and 8.42pm on Tuesday because of a problem with overhead wires between Jadavpur and Baghajatin stations.     Mahesh Pathak, 18, allegedly jumped in front of Down Shantipur Local near No. 26 rail gate at Dakshindari in Lake Town on Tuesday afternoon. Local residents said Pathak, who also lived in the area, committed suicide after being beaten up on Monday night by family members of a girl he had allegedly molested. Neither the girl nor her family members lodged a complaint with police.

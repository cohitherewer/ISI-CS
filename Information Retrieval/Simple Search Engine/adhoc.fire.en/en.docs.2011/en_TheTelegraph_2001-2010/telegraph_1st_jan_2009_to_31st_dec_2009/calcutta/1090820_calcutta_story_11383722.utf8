The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Man surrenders in murder case
                                                                                                               Man surrenders in murder case
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A 42-year-old man, wanted in several criminal cases, surrendered before a Howrah court on Wednesday in connection with the abduction and murder of seven-year-old Yash Lakhotia.        
	Ranjit Bhattacharya, who disappeared after the childs body was found on January 31, walked into the court with his lawyer and surrendered before the second sessions judge apparently under pressure from the CID.        
	Sleuths said Ranjit, alias Chotu, had arranged for a hideout in north Howrah where Yash was kept after his abduction on January 29.         
	Sleuths said Ranjit, a resident of Netaji Subhas Road in Shibpur, went missing shortly after Yashs body was found in a bush on Foreshore Road though he was not under the scanner.        
	It was only recently that the CID unearthed clues suggesting Ranjits link with Yashs abduction and murder.        
	When cops tried to track Ranjits cellphone they found he was frequently changing his SIM card while travelling across the country. The sleuths then got in touch with his family members asking them to tell Ranjit to surrender.        
	He must have got the message loud and clear, said an officer.        
	Cops said Ranjit was involved in several criminal cases, including the murder of Chaal Swapan and Maach Swapan on August 19, 2008.        
	The Howrah police, who were probing the case before the CID took over, had identified Santosh Singh, an aide of the Lakhotias, as the mastermind of the abduction and murder.        
	Santosh denied the charge and told reporters from his hideout that a prominent promoter was behind the crime.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Heritage engine driver
                                                                                                               Heritage engine driver
                                          
	She has travelled a long way to keep travelling a long way.         
	Papia Ghoshal from New Alipore drives a heritage steam engine in the UK, for West Somerset Railway. She claims she is the lone woman and only Indian to do so. She does it as a hobby, free.         
	I used to have this dream since childhood that I am driving a big steam engine. The train would, however, be floating in the clouds. I still have that dream, says Papia, who divides her time between Calcutta and the West. She is a political science honours graduate from Asutosh College.        
	In 2004 she enrolled with Bluebell Line in Sussex. Papia recalls that on the day of the first practical class, she found the main lever wouldnt move and when she pulled with all her might it hit her face.        
	It was a stately Stepney engine and I had jumped in excitedly but the lever gave me a black eye. After that it was easy for me. After all, I had practised it all in my dreams, smiles Papia, also a poet and a dancer.

                      A vision of the surreal world                    To speak technically photography is the art of writing with light. But if I want to think about it more philosophically, I can say that photography is the art of writing with time. When you capture an image you capture not only a piece of space, you also capture a piece of time. So you have this piece of specific time in your square or rectangle. In that sense I find that photography has more to do with time than with light.  Gerardo Suter        Sanjib Sens lenses capture nude women in various sculpturesque postures. Highly stylised photographs evoke antique movement in a time frame; maybe something in the flavour and fervour of an erupted sculptural frieze. There is no feeling of stillness or repose in any of the subjects because a tense, tactile moment is created in the way the hands position themselves. His subjects do not sit in the languorous, leisured leggy region. Rather, from each frame the womans sculpturesque figure reaches out, relaxes, snakes, twists and bends in fluid movements. The fluidity looks surreal and even eerie at times, and transports viewers into a sublime realm, far away from the humdrum of mundane existence.

                      Engrossing entertainment                    A recipient of the Padma Shri, theatre personality Amir Raza Husain firmly believes that the purpose of theatre is entertainment and has strived to win over his audience in his years spent on stage. He took Indian theatre to realms hitherto unseen with productions like Legend of Ram and The 50 Days War. History, legends, comedy, all dot a career that began with a realisation that theatre was his life. Presented by WelcomTheatre, his latest play The Itch (co-directed by his wife Virat Husain) is a classic over-the-top British comedy with jokes and situations bordering on the weird. Set in an apartment atop the National Bank in London, the play dwells on the lives of the newly-married couple, Frances and Peter Hunter, their family and friends. Their seemingly normal lives go for a toss when they receive pornographic material in the post. They attempt to hide and dispose of the material, leading to a series of bizarre instances. Peters snobbish mother and the cashier of Peters bank become inextricably entangled, with the new couple getting carried away by the unfolding events. As for its sets, the play gets a perfect living space that gives the ambience of any ordinary middle-class home. Husain, as the quirky friend forced to bear the burden of the crisis, promises to deliver a brilliant performance and garner a lot of laughter from the audience.                    Event: Play in English, The Itch, produced by WelcomTheatre When: Today at 6.45 pm Where: Pala, ITC Sonar, Calcutta

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Torched and tormented, city braces for vendetta politics on streets   Brand Bengal battered amp; bruised, again   John Philip Jones (Amit Datta)
                                                                                                               Torched and tormented, city braces for vendetta politics on streets     Brand Bengal battered amp; bruised, again
          DEVADEEP PUROHIT                                                         
	Fear is back. For the mother who drops her kid to school every morning, for the wage-earner and the office-goer who has to battle it out every day, and for the entrepreneur who has to generate return on investments.        
	Bandhs are not new to citizens of Calcutta. But Fridays bandh  with day-long vandalism across the city as its prelude  could be different as it signals a return to disruptive politics, which many fear will continue at least till the next Assembly elections.         
	I saw some people attacking a bus near Minto Park. It was clear from their action that they did not smash it and set it on fire spontaneously. It was pre-planned, and that is scary, said Suman Banerjee, an employee with a private firm who was waiting in vain for a taxi at the Lansdowne-Minto Park crossing.        
	While the planned assault on the government bus unnerved him, he was baffled to see cops  standing barely 100 metres away  doing nothing to prevent the vandals.                  John Philip Jones (Amit Datta)
      
	The scenes enacted on the streets of Calcutta may help political parties build their brand, but it will have an adverse impact on Brand Bengal, felt John Philip Jones, advertising guru and international expert on brand management.         
	Strikes can take place. But an environment of lawlessness can have a negative impact on the brand of a state, which wants to attract investments and tourists and is also keen to play a bigger role in national polity, said Jones, in town to conduct a two-day session on brand management in times of recession.        
	The bandh  with Congress as the main sponsor and Trinamul Congress backing it  forced CII, the organisers of the event, to cancel Fridays half-day session and pack another two hours into Thursdays programme.        
	According to Jones, brand image is extremely important for a state like Bengal, which recently lost a big investor like Tata.        
	The world outside should know the positives of Bengal like the growth opportunities, quality human resources, its rich history and attractiveness as a tourist destination, said the veteran, who suggested a concrete brand communication strategy to highlight the strengths of the state.        
	Bengal, of course, is being highlighted for all the wrong reasons. The images of burnt and smashed buses arent the only factors behind the beating Brand Bengal is taking. A rejuvenated Opposition, administrative inaction and regular political conflicts in the state, from the hills to the central business district of the state capital, have contributed to the fear factor. Such things will have a terrible impact on the states brand in the long run, warned Jones.        
	But with the battle for Writers Buildings hotting up, Brand Bengal has slipped down the priority list of political bosses. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee blamed the Opposition for Thursdays violence while Partha Chatterjee, the leader of Opposition in the Assembly, blamed the government for the state of affairs. The government is responsible for all the trouble as they are occupying the seat of power after losing the moral right to be there, said Chatterjee.         
	But for the common Calcuttan, these allegations and counter allegations matter little in the face of fear. Why cant the political parties let us live in peace? asked Dolon Sen, who dare not send her six-year-old to school on Friday.

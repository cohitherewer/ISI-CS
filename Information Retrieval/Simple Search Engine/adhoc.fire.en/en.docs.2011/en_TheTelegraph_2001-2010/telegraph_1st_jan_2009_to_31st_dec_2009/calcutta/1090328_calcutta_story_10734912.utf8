The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Improved landing gear ready 
                                                                                                               Improved landing gear ready 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The new Category II Instrument Landing System (CAT-II ILS) was commissioned at the airport on Friday night.        
	A special calibration aircraft that flew in from Delhi on Thursday afternoon to test the functioning of CAT-II ILS completed the two-day exercise on Friday evening.        
	The calibration was successful and we have commissioned the new ILS, said P.K. Singhal, the regional executive director (east) of the Airports Authority of India (AAI).         
	The new set of ILS equipment was imported from the US and installed at a cost of around Rs 1 crore.        
	Replacement of the ILS equipment, installed in 1993, was overdue. The changeover was deferred in October.        
	By adding facilities, the system can be upgraded to CAT-III ILS, which allows operation of flights when runway visibility is as low as 50 metres. The new equipment is more precise and compatible with CAT-III, said Singhal.        
	The CAT-III ILS comprises a surface movement ground control system  a radar used for monitoring flights after they land. The system, costing about Rs 4 crore, will be installed in around three months, said an official.

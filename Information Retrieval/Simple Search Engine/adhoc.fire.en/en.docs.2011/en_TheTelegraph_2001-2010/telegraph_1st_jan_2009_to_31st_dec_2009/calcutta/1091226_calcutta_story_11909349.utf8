The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Nightmare from Xmas 04
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Nightmare from Xmas 04
          SANJAY MANDAL                                          Charuchandra Das,  a tsunami survivor        
	Christmas 2004 was the last time Charuchandra Das had a good nights sleep.        
	The 44-year-old Bhowanipore resident, then based in Car Nicobar, remembers his cook waking him up the morning after Xmas with a steaming cup of tea when he suddenly heard a rumble that quickly turned into a roar. The next thing Das knew, he was being chased by a tidal sea wave so tall that it looked like a black mountain had sprung up from the sea.        
	Das was one of the lucky few to survive the most devastating tsunami in history  and then three days on a ravaged island without food and water  but the disaster and its aftermath have become a recurring nightmare that wouldnt let him lead a normal life even five years later.        
	Try as I might, I cant get December 26, 2004, out of my mind. I try to sleep but wake up with a start, thinking its happening again, Das, who is no longer employed, told Metro on the eve of the fifth anniversary of the tsunami.        
	Das had gone to Car Nicobar in January 2004 to work for the Central Tribal Co-operative Society near the village of Chuckchucha. He had barely adjusted to life there when the tsunami struck.        
	Dass family in Calcutta had given him up for dead until he contacted them after being brought to Chennai for treatment. I was in no condition to speak for several days. I still dont know how I escaped being swallowed by the sea, he recalled.        
	On returning to Calcutta, Das lapsed into acute depression and showed signs of various psychological disorders but mustered the courage to return to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands a year later.         
	The two-storeyed building where I used to work was razed by the tsunami; so the tribal co-operative offered me a posting in Port Blair, which I took up. But I quickly learnt that I couldnt work there anymore. I would suddenly run a high fever and feel so weak that I wouldnt be able to stand. I had no choice but to come back, he recalled.        
	It took Das two years to partially recover from the physical symptoms, though he still has nightmares about the sea advancing towards him the moment he closes his eyes. I shiver uncontrollably when I remember the events of five years ago, he said.        
	Das has appealed to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee for financial assistance but received only assurances of help from his office.         
	The CMs secretariat wrote back to me twice, in 2007 and 2008, promising help that never came. I could have done with some kind of assistance given my medical condition and inability to work, rued Das.        
	With virtually no source of income, Das has gone without specialised treatment for his depression and associated psychological disorders. Sister Sandhya said her brother would jump out of bed and run out of the room on hearing the slightest sound.        
	According to psychiatrists, Das is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.        
	It has persisted because he did not undergo proper treatment all these years. He needs a psychometric assessment, medicines and supportive therapy, depending on the level of stress, said city-based psychiatrist Ranadip Ghosh Roy, a former general secretary of the Indian Psychiatric Society.         
	If this condition persists, he will become mentally incapacitated, which can lead to cognitive impairment, the doctor warned.

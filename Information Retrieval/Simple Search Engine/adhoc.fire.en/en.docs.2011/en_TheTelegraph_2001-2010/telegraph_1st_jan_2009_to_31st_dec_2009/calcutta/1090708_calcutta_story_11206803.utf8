The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bolly bounces back with three-day biggies
                                                                                                               Bolly bounces back with three-day biggies
  - New York and Kambakkht Ishq set the tone for first weekend killing before next blockbuster hits          PRATIM D. GUPTA                                                  
	First New York and now Kambakkht Ishq  Bollywood is dishing out three-day hits, back-to-back, after a nine-week break. Desperate to make up for lost time, the industry has lined up one Friday biggie after another, with a monsoon shower of shows. The aim? To make a box-office killing in the first weekend before the next blockbuster hits.        
	If John Abraham and Katrina Kaif helped New York gross Rs 18 crore (net) in the first three days, Akshay Kumar and Kareena Kapoor have powered Kambakkht Ishq to collections of Rs 24.5 crore (net) in the opening weekend. The Bolly-in-Holly tale of Kambakkht Ishq, which released across 2,000-plus screens worldwide, blasted off in Calcutta with 63 screens, though audience reactions ranged from puerile to paisa vasool.        
	Business has been extraordinary in the first three days, says Lokesh Mukut of M.M. Moviez that distributed Kambakkht Ishq in town. Monday saw the usual weekday fall, but first-week collections should break a few records.        
	A few records have already been broken. Many INOX properties in the country registered the highest ever single-day footfall on Sunday. The first two Fridays after the strike have been like the Diwali week, says Harshavardhan Gangurde, the vice-president (marketing) of INOX. The films were very well marketed as they had a limited window with big movies releasing every Friday. Our three Calcutta properties have recorded 80 per cent occupancy.        
	Trade analyst Taran Adarsh feels that New York and Kambakkht Ishq will help the industry bounce back in a big way after the plex-producer battle. And theres much more to come. This Friday theres Short Kut  The Con is On (Akshaye Khanna-Arshad Warsi-Amrita Rao), followed by Luck (Imran Khan-Shruti Haasan) on July 24, and Imtiaz Alis Love Aaj Kal with Saif Ali Khan-Deepika Padukone on July 31, capped by Vishal Bhardwajs Kaminey (Shahid Kapur-Priyanka Chopra) on August 14.        
	This is a real blockbuster Bollywood season. And I will be watching every new release on the first Saturday night, smiled Pinky Agarwal, a Bolly junkie.

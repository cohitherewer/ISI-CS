The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Two held for Puja extortion
                                                                                                               Two held for Puja extortion
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two members of a puja organising committee in Chitpur were arrested for allegedly trying to extort money from a trader in the name of Puja subscription.         
	The trader, Niranjan Ghosh, said in his complaint that he was also assaulted by the organisers of Campbagan Sarbojanin Durgotsav. These were the first arrests for forcible collection of subscription this year, police said.         
	We have arrested the secretary of the puja committee, Aloke Guha, and another member, Asim Bera, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters).        
	Ghosh, a resident of Campbagan who runs a printing press, said in his complaint on Sunday night that he was asked to bear the expenses of Ashtami puja (over Rs 50,000).         
	According to the complaint, Bera had gone to Ghoshs house on Sunday night and demanded the money. He misbehaved with my wife and manhandled me. I told him that I could not pay such a huge amount but my pleas fell on deaf ears. He left saying he would return for the money, Ghosh said.        
	The police raided the secretarys house the same night. Guha was present when Ghosh was approached for the money earlier, said an officer.        
	Shamim said the practice of collecting puja subscription forcibly was on the wane for the past three years.

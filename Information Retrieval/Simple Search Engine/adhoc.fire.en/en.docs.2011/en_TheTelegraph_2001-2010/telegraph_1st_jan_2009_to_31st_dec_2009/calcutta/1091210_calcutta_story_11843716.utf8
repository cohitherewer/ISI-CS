The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Queen to port trusts rescue
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Queen to port trusts rescue
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	A deed signed by Queen Victoria in 1874 swung a case in favour of Calcutta Port Trust in the high court on Wednesday.         
	Justice Debasish Kargupta passed an order restraining the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) from allowing parking of vehicles along the Hooghly as the land was under the supervision of Calcutta Port Trust (CPT).         
	The judge passed the order after going through the British era deed, which said that in 1874, Queen Victoria had handed over the control of a vast area (from Babughat to Ahiritola) on the bank of the river to CPT.        
	According to CMC sources, the civic body had handed over the control of the areas near the Adyasradhya Ghat crossing, Canning Street, PC Tagore Street and the Armenian Road-Strand Road crossing to private organisations for fee-based parking.        
	How can the CMC allow people to park their cars in the areas that are directly our control? Why should the civic body be allowed to make money by letting out land belonging to my client? CPT counsel Subir Sanyal asked. He claimed the CMC had not even sought permission from his client before turning the riverfront into fee parking zones.         
	Appearing for the civic body, advocate Alok Ghosh opposed the CPT prayer and said: The area is being maintained by the civic body for the past 100 years. My client had never claimed its right, so why is it raising objection on the parking of vehicles there?        
	The CPT lawyer then produced Queen Victorias deed and the judge asked the CMC to furnish any document on the modification of that order in the intervening years. When the CMC failed to produce any such document, the judge passed the order and disposed of the case.        
	Faiyaz Ahmed Khan, a mayoral council member of the CMC who looks after parking affairs, said: I am not aware of the order. If the court upholds the CPTs contention, I must carry out the order.        
	A few months back, the army had moved a similar petition in the court and claimed that the CMC had let out army land adjacent to the Maidan to the Tatas for parking. The case is pending.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bomb scan triggers mall scare
                                                                                                               Bomb scan triggers mall scare
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Visitors and employees wait outside City Centre after being evacuated on Tuesday afternoon. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                  
	Police shut down City Centre for two-and-a-half-hours on Tuesday morning after a call from the Director General Control Room alerted them to the possibility of a bomb planted on the premises.         
	No bomb was found but the search revealed security loopholes at the Salt Lake mall. The cops issued a memo asking the City Centre authorities to be more vigilant.        
	The mall authorities claimed the exercise was a mock drill, which the police denied.         
	The cops called us in the afternoon and said they would conduct a mock drill to check their preparedness. They also asked us not to tell this to our employees and guards so that the drill could be conducted in the right spirit, said Vijay Dwivedi, the general manager (mall management) of City Centre.        
	The Director General Control Room informed the office of the sub-divisional police officer of Bidhannagar around 11.30am that a bomb might have been planted at City Centre and the mall should be vacated immediately and searched, said Debabrata Das, the additional superintendent of Bidhannagar police.        
	Within minutes, announcements were made over the malls public address system, asking visitors as well as store employees to vacate the premises immediately. Shows at the multiplex were stopped and the audience was asked to leave.         
	Before I could react to the announcement, I was herded out of the mall along with other visitors by the guards. I picked up my five-year-old son and rushed as fast as possible. It was scary, said Rohini Dasgupta, a resident of Salt Lake.        
	I did not even get time to pick my wallet, card holder, cellphone and camera and had to leave them in the shop. The shutters were also not pulled down properly. I just hope I get back my belongings, said Susmita Dutta Roy, an employee at a mall store, while waiting outside.        
	By noon, the mall was empty and security personnel stood guard preventing anyone from entering.         
	Policemen, members of the bomb disposal squad and sniffer dogs scanned the mall. A box containing a heavy metal object was found on the ground floor of the mall. The bomb disposal squad confirmed after tests that it was not an explosive. The mall re-opened at 2.30pm.        
	Security in the mall was not adequate. Otherwise, how could someone enter the mall and leave such a suspicious object? asked North 24-Parganas police superintendent Rahul Shrivastava.        
	The authorities are trying to hide their lapses by calling Tuesdays operation a mock drill. We have sent a memo to the authorities asking them to be more alert, added Shrivastava.        
	Dwivedi denied receiving any memo from the police.

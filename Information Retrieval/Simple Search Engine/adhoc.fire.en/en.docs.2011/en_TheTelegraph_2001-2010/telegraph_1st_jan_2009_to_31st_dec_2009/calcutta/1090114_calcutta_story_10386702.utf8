The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Dead baby in canal
                                                                                                               Dead baby in canal
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The body of a six-month-old boy was found floating in the Chetla Lockgate Canal on Tuesday. Wrapped in a white cloth and a polythene, the baby was spotted near the canal banks around 4.30pm.        
	At first I thought it was a toy. But when I realised it was a dead baby, I got scared and informed my parents and elders in the locality, said 10-year-old Krishna Sarkar, who was playing on the canal banks.        
	Police said the body was partially decomposed but there were no major injury marks. The body has been sent for post-mortem.         
	The elbow and knee were bandaged, suggesting that the baby might have been treated in a hospital, said an officer.         
	We are trying to locate the parents of the boy, he added. Residents insisted that the baby was not from the area.

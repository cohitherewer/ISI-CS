The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Dud firm director sent to lock-up
                                                                                                               Dud firm director sent to lock-up
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Debarchana Mitra Ghosh, the director of dud IT firm Infogen Global who was arrested on Thursday, was remanded in police custody for 14 days on Friday.        
	The 31-year-old, wife of company founder Anirban Ghosh and the firms operational HR manager, had been granted anticipatory bail by the high court earlier this month in regard to a complaint filed by one of the employees.        
	The judge had asked her to appear before a trial court. When Debarchana appeared in the trial court at Mayukh Bhavan in Salt Lake on Thursday, CID officers arrested her in connection with a case lodged by another employee of the firm.        
	We had information that Debarchana will appear in court. She and her father were held while they were leaving the court. Her father was released after questioning, said a CID officer.         
	Debarchana was charged with conspiracy, criminal breach of trust, cheating and forgery. The company duped employees of over Rs 6 crore, said Anjan Chowdhury, the assistant public prosecutor.        
	Of the four directors of the firm, Anirbans aunt Jharna Chandra and mother Jaya Ghosh were arrested earlier.        
	On Friday afternoon, around 100 duped employees of Infogen Global and members of West Bengal IT Services Association gathered outside the court and demonstrated, demanding stringent punishment for the accused and refund of the Rs 50,000 security deposit.        
	We had lost hope of getting justice. The arrest of Debarchana has rekindled our expectation. We believe Anirban Ghosh, too, will be arrested soon and punished, said Sayan Ghosh, one of the duped employees.        
	Even after being duped and losing their first job, he and his colleagues have not lost heart. They have made the placement agencies that had liaised between engineering colleges and Infogen Global promise to find them other jobs.        
	Three of the agencies have agreed to help us with technical and soft skills training and find us jobs free of cost, said another employee Sujoy Sengupta. Sourav Kundu, the operational head of Ejobs India, confirmed that the agency was providing technical training for three months to the duped employees and will also help them find jobs.        
	We had no clue that Infogen Global is a dud company. Since we had sent about 100 candidates there, we are ready to take the responsibility of training them and providing them other jobs, said Kundu.

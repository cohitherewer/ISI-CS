The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CID to probe Botanic tree felling case
                                                                                                               CID to probe Botanic tree felling case
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          One of the trees felled in Botanic Gardens                                  
	The high court on Friday directed the CID to probe the alleged felling of trees in Botanic Gardens.        
	The division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice B. Somadder asked P. Neeraj Nayan, the inspector-general of the CID, to complete the probe in three months. Monthly reports will have to filed in the court till the final report is submitted.        
	The order followed a submission by advocate-general Balai Ray that his government had no objection to a CBI probe. The CID inspector-general, who jointed the agency recently from the CBI, is a competent officer. If the court grants permission, he can handle the case, Ray told the judges.        
	Environment activist and the petitioner in the case, Subhash Dutta had sought a CBI probe. Last month, the court had asked the state whether it had any objection if the central agency took up the case.        
	In November 2008, Dutta had moved a petition alleging that the authorities of the 200-year-old garden had allowed its employees to cut down more than 100 trees.        
	The court had set up a three-member inquiry committee  comprising city police chief Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti, advocate Anindya Mitra and the principal chief conservator of forests, Atanu Raha  which found the allegations to be true.        
	Appearing for the garden authorities, advocate R.N, Dutta said on Friday that his clients had lodged a police complaint.         
	The police are conducting a probe. So there is no need for a CID investigation, the advocate said. He added that the state forest department, too, was investigating the matter.         
	But the court said that neither the police nor the forest department had taken any step with regard to the case. So we are directing the CID to conduct the probe.

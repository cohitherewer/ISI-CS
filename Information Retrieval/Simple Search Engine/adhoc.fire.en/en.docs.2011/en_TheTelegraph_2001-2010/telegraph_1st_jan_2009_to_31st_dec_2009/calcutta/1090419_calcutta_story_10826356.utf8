The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Election special platform
                                                                                                               Election special platform
										      stage                        Usha Gangulys group Rangakarmee had staged Kashipur ka Kashinama and Maiyyat for elections in Howrah. A Telegraph picture				                           
	If some are ready with taunts for Mamashankar (thats Mamata Banerjee and former Congress chief minister Siddhartha Sankar Ray, added), their opponents prophesy the fall of Suddhadev Bhattacharjee. There is also talk of a Bhisma-like Moti Basu, an all-powerful Kubhas Chakraborty and the intellectual, Maruprassanna.         
	These are characters from Baam Jamanar Panchali, a play written and directed by Shekhar Sen, and Kaal Bhasma by Chandan Sen .        
	The city and the districts are again suffering from the onslaught of a certain brand of theatre  election street plays. Not to be confused with the plays of protest or experimentation staged by the likes of Badal Sircar, these street performances are designed for instant response, which, its makers hope, will translate into votes.         
	Respectable theatre groups may shy away from staging these plays under their banners, but the number of people joining poll play platform has jumped manifold. Its not just the opposition, but also the establishment. Theatre groups have sprouted overnight, though many of the recruits are innocent of any stage experience. There is a record participation of over 500 theatre groups from all parts of Bengal, said an enthusiastic Left Front activist.         
	If one party accuses the other for the Nandigram carnage, the other does the same using video footage as proof. In Kaal Bhasma, Chandan Sen (one of the few well-known playwrights in the fray) gives a rather confusing mix of characters from the Ramayana, genetic engineering and Tagore to illustrate a Bengal under attack  of people who are against industry.         
	In retaliation, Baam Jamanar Panchali is sponsored by the Pradesh Congress and produced entirely by its members.         
	We will have everyone on stage wearing the exact dhotis, the caps, with the mannerisms when people see a chief minister look- alike being judged on stage by women who have been assaulted and killed during his regime, the effect on the audience will be very strong, says Shekhar Sen.         
	Manik Mondal is anti-establishment too, but doesnt believe in parody. His play, he says is aimed to touch hearts. Mondal, who once covered the city with posters of Manusher Cheye Chhagol Daami, has sent out his team of six groups, who are performing Buddho Noy Shanti Chai in various places. He claims that he is threatened by political goons.         
	In Buddho Noy... Mondal too has a tribunal: a minister is confronted by probing questions about past crimes by a wooden Christ.        
	Election plays are a priority for the Left Front and all 21 plays for the Left have been published by Group Theatre in booklets titled Nirbachani Pathnatak, priced at Rs 10.         
	But many groups prefer to improvise. We dont care for scripts. Party guidelines on national issues and local problems or how they have been solved can easily be strung together with songs and music, said Gautam Gyne, who runs an election special group.         
	Though brushed off as insignificant by theatre personalities, poll plays have a long history since Panu Pal and Utpal Dutt staged such plays at street corners, in courtyards and even on trucks.         
	Dutt is known to have taken pride in some of his campaign plays like Naya Tuglaq, Moyna Tadanta, Kalo Haath or Din Badaler Pala. Poll plays, said Dutt, were an opportunity to get close to the real starvation and the real heroism of the masses.         
	This does not hold today. The plays are more an opportunity to show loyalty and remain in the partys good books. In these hard times they bring good food and substantial pocket money, says a performer who wouldnt be named.       SEBANTI SARKAR

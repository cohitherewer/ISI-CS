  - Masters for 25000, sketches for 2000, plus phuchka          ARKA DAS                          Ganesh Pyne and Jogen Chowdhury at Art Mela in CIMA Gallery on Friday. (Aranya Sen)                                        
	A Samir Aich, Paresh Maity, Partha Pratim Deb or an Atin Basak mixed-media piece for Rs 15,000. A Ganesh Pyne, Ramananda Bandyopadhyay, Jogen Chowdhury, Lalu Prasad Shaw, Suvaprasanna or Ganesh Haloi for Rs 25,000. Sculptures by Bimal Kundu or Shyamal Roy for Rs 10,000.         
	The three-day Art Mela at CIMA, unveiled on Friday morning at the Sunny Park gallery, offers good art at affordable prices  at Rs 500 to Rs 25,000, its actually a steal.        
	This was really necessary for a city like Calcutta, where there are lots of people who genuinely appreciate art but cannot afford it. And the feel at the fair is very positive, said veteran artist Ramananda Bandyopadhyay.        
	Prices apart, the positive feel had a lot to do with the ambience  car park turned into an adda space overhung with shamianas, a tea kiosk, a phuchkawallah, a jhalmuriwallah, a stall for KC Das sweets and Rabindrasangeet in the crisp November air.                                
	Listed into sections or artists, the gallery space offers a range of art in varied media, including paintings, ceramics, sculptures, graphics, photographs and prints. The folk and tribal art section, along with watercolours, offers Kalighat pata replicas and Madhubani paintings, along with watercolours by practising students. Photographs by Nilanjan Ray, Sumit Basu and Jayanta Saha are on offer Rs 15,000 onwards.        
	Live portraits can be done, while on-the-spot caricatures by Suman Chowdhury would cost Rs 3,000. Works by established artists share another section  Aditya Basak, Jaysri Burman, Paresh Maity, Jaya Ganguly, Veena Bhargava.... for Rs 8,000 to 10,000. Etchings, sketches and paintings by Partha Dasgupta, Atin Basak, Shreyasi Chatterjee, Chandra Bhattacharya and Ashok Mullick come for Rs 2,000-18,000.         
	This is a very good idea for art in general in the city. It offers a chance to someone like me, who would like to own a great artwork but doesnt always have the budget to, said sculptor Debajit Chakraborty, whose ceramic works are on display at the Mela.        
	The Mela also offers works by up-and-comers, including the graphics-heavy mixed-media ones of Koustav Neogi and the weird creations of Satyajit Roy, for Rs 1,500-4,000. Then there are the outpourings of Raja Mohan Das, a deaf boy from Hooghly. The Mela is lending support to the Indian Institute for Cerebral Palsy.        
	The fastest-selling items on Day One? The masters section, with Ganesh Pyne, Ramananda Bandyopadhyay, Lalu Prasad Shaw, Rabin Mondal, Ganesh Haloi, Jogen Chowdhury, Suhas Roy and Suvaprasanna, averaging Rs 25,000 apiece.        
	Most of the works on display here were sold in the first 10 minutes of opening the exhibit at 11am, said Praiti Sarkar of CIMA, It was like opening the floodgates.        
	The floodgates remain open, from 11am to 8pm on Satuday and Sunday.

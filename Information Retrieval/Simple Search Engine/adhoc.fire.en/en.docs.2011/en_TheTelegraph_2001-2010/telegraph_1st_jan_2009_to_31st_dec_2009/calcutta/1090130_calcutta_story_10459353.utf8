                                                                                                               Murder tales, with humour
  - Writer fetes RK Narayan          A STAFF REPORTER                          Author Alexander McCall Smith at the Ashoke Kumar Sarkar Memorial Lecture on Thursday. Picture by Amit Datta                                         
	Murder may be on his mind, but that is not all.        
	Alexander McCall Smith, author of the bestselling No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency series, who delivered the Ashoke Kumar Sarkar Memorial Lecture at the Book Fair on Thursday, also delivered a passionate defence of humour.         
	He spoke of a host of Indian writers, wondering at the rate at which they are picking up awards from all over the globe and ending in a tribute to the works of RK Narayan.        
	The Scottish writer, who looks like an affable, affectionate grandfather  and if one is permitted to say so, speaks like one too, but with wry humour  said to the packed UBI auditorium that his lecture would address one big question: Why are Indian writers, or writers of Indian origin living elsewhere, winning all the prizes? Have they pierced the secret of writing?         
	McCall Smith, whose first title of the detective series, The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency featuring Mma Ramotswe of Gaborone, Botswana, has sold 15 million copies worldwide, thinks that they have.        
	I am usually stuck by the euphony of their prose, he said, naming Vikram Seth and Vikram Chandra among the Indian authors he admires.        
	But it is another Indian author who left a lasting impression on him, he said: RK Narayan, the creator of the mythical Malgudi  and Swami and his friends.        
	It is not very fashionable now to invoke Narayans prose, but McCall Smith, with his wry humour, would probably dismiss that as nonsense. As he did the idea that crime fiction needs to be excluded from literary fiction. Dickens, Dostoyevsky and Patricia Highsmith all wrote about crime, he reminded.         
	RK Narayan, whom he discovered late, embodies the biggest themes of literature, said McCall Smith. In one thin slice of humanity, he said, Narayan could capture the universal. He showed human beings striving. Narayan wrote about the dignity of small persons, of them striving for something they may not attain, but which leads the reader to imagine what human beings are capable of. Those are the big issues.        
	And Narayan does it with such humour. Immense humour. Through humour, said the writer of four ongoing fiction series  yes, thats how much he writes, including the Ladies Detective Agency series novels  a writer can make the most profound and important point. Though generally humour writing is a bit rare now, he added.        
	I beat the drum for humour, said McCall Smith.

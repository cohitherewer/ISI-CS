The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Song of the outcast
                                                                                                               Song of the outcast
										      stage                        Debabrata Biswas				                           
	A year before his death Rabindrasangeet exponent Debabrata Biswas encapsulated his disappointments and frustrations in his autobiography Bratyajoner Ruddhasangeet (stifled song of the outcast). Three decades later, another Bratyajon is presenting a Ruddhasangeet that turns out to be a chorus of artistic talents that have been suppressed or regimented post-Independence.        
	Only this Ruddhasangeet, is a play written and directed by Bratya Basu, to be presented by his new theatre group Bratyajon at 6.30pm on March 20 at the Academy of Fine Arts.        
	My play, in two parts, depicts the conflicts in Biswass life. First comes his disputes with the IPTA and his breaking away from the Communist Party. Then comes Biswass problems with Visva-Bharati, which felt he threatened the purity of Tagores songs, says Bratya.        
	The play presents the way the creative spirit has always been dominated by institutions with those in power never allowing individuals to flourish. It urges artists to continue fighting against the forces that try to bind or stifle them.        
	Since the late 1960s, Visva-Bharati prohibited Biswas from producing Rabindrasangeet records. His efforts to interpret Tagore was criticised as was his choice of European instruments. The style, however, won countless hearts.        
	The play, though largely focussed on Biswas, has Hemango Biswas, Salil Chowdhury, Sambhu Mitra, Bijan Bhattacharya, Ritwik Ghatak, Suchitra Mitra, Subhas Mukhopadhyay and Manjushree Chaki Sarkar as characters.        
	Debshankar Haldar is playing Debabrata Biswas while Satrajit Sarkar is Ritwik Ghatak (for whose Meghe Dhaka Tara Biswas had sung a song) and Susmita Goswami is Suchitra Mitra. Biswass songs will be used as background music and some Tagore songs will be sung live. There is a fictional couple in the play, portrayed by Debashish Roy and Bratyas wife Poulomi.        
	The play is very different from what I have written so far. If there can be a play on Beethoven why cant there be one on Biswas? During my research I found that unfortunately very little archival material remains from Biswass career, says Bratya.       SEBANTI SARKAR

                      Classical melodies from the south                    Over the years, the series of Carnatic music festivals hosted by Rasikhapriya, have become popular for consistently featuring famous artistes, who are all living legends in their own right. However, the artistes of comparatively lesser renown, participating in its current mid-year festival beginning today, are in no way less talented or proficient than their more famous counterparts. A three-day festival, this is the first part of Rasikhapriyas 17th year programme, and is a precursor to its grand 17th anniversary series to be held in November. Commencing with an invocation and welcome address, this evenings performance features a vocal recital by Charulatha Mani (picture right), who presents Isai Payanam. A journey into ragas in classical and film music, it is a classical Kutcheri interspersed with raga-based film songs. She will be accompanied by Tiruvarur N. Balam (violin) and R. Mohanakrishnan (mridangam). Tomorrow: Flute recital by J.A. Jayanth and vocal recital by R. Suryaprakash. The concluding days programme comprises two vocal recitals, the first by Vijayalakshmy Subramaniam, to be followed by that of Dr. R. Ganesh.

	Galaxies at the fingertips        
	What if you could touch the sky and identify the constellations and galaxies with your fingers?         
	That is the opportunity visitors will have at World of Darkness, the exhibition at the Birla Industrial and Technological Museum (BITM), on Gurusaday Road. On till June 17, it is part of BITMs year-long golden jubilee celebrations.         
	Celebrating 200 years of Braille, the exhibition, inaugurated on May 2, introduces the sighted to a learning process that depends solely on the senses of touch and hearing.         
	BITM works with the physically and mentally challenged and has installed provisions like ramps, lifts and special guides for their convenience. At this exhibition, the guides are visually challenged volunteers from Ramakrishna Mission Blind Boys Academy, JU Special Education Cell, Calcutta Blind School and Lighthouse for the Blind. They help visitors through the half-lit gallery, with exhibits equipped with Braille labels, touch sensors and recorded audio information.         
	Another new gallery is on popular science, with exhibits on principles like 3D vision and how spinners can make a ball swerve in mid-flight. A new exhibit is a Dynamic Globe, an inflatable ball of transparent synthetic fibre with an inbuilt projector that casts images across the globe for viewers to see the planets and moons from close quarters.         
	Group of Nine, an in-house film, will be screened over the next few days too.         
	I enjoyed the quiz, with the questions on sounds and cut-outs. I recognised the rooster and the cricket. At the end of the quiz, the computer said well done!, smiled Ankan Chowdhury, a 10-year-old from Barasat.        
	The attitude towards science museums has changed since BITMs inauguration on May 2, 1959, when the purpose of the founder, then chief minister Bidhan Chandra Roy, was to give the city something akin to the Deutsche Museum, said director Emdadul Islam.         
	A commemorative book, 50th anniversary of BITM, released by Sarala Birla, salutes the technicians and planners. While the first exhibits were static models of machines reproduced painstakingly from photographs, we now have interactive exhibits, he added.

	What better way to highlight pressing issues affecting our environment than to bring alive fantasy creatures from fairy tales?               
	That is what Ramanjit Kaur of The Creative Arts, in collaboration with the Goethe Institut, hopes to do with her play, Snow White and the Saline Curse.        
	A bunch of chirpy students of The Creative Arts, aged between five and 15, will stage the play on May 7 and 8 at 6.30pm at the Max Mueller Bhavan auditorium.        
	Weve been working on environment issues for the past two years and did three plays on pollution, deforestation and weather change last year. This time, we are looking at a regional concern, the Sunderbans, says Ramanjit, who has tried to weave in the issues plaguing the largest estuarine mangrove forest in the world into the Grimms brothers tale, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.        
	The name of the play refers to the briny waters of the Sunderbans which the queen thinks will kill her, she adds.        
	The play has prompted Max Mueller Bhavan to initiate a year-long project with The Creative Arts.         
	They want us to find relevance in other Grimms Brothers stories and stage plays on contemporary local issues, says Ramanjit.        
	In keeping with the original tale, when told by her mirror that Snow White is the fairest of them all, the queen banishes her stepdaughter.         
	She is packed off to the Sunderbans, where the queen hopes she will die in the briny waters.         
	The dwarfs come marching in and save Snow White. The prince rides in, falls in love with Snow White and urges everyone to grow mangroves to save the land. Children dressed as tigers, rabbits, boars and deer remind us of the danger to their lives. Woodcutters and honey gatherers also make an appearance.         
	The sets have been designed with bold cut-outs of the Sunderbans foliage to inject a feeling of mystery. There will be many levels on the stage. A large mirror with a decorated back will work as the soul of the queen. Expect a lot of live music and singing, she says.

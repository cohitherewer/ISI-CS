          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	One of the injured in the collision between a bus and a truck on Bombay Road on Sunday evening died at SSKM Hospital on Monday, taking the toll to 22.         
	Twenty passengers of the bus are admitted to Uluberia Sub-divisional Hospital and 11 to Bagnan Gramin Hospital.         
	Hospital officials said 20 people killed in the crash had been identified by their family members. Police suspect that one of the two who could not be identified was the driver of the truck that was speeding down the wrong flank of the road when it rammed into the overloaded bus.        
	The other unidentified mishap victim is around 60 years old.        
	Kamal Kishore Singh, the superintendent of Uluberia Sub-divisional Hospital, said: We completed the post-mortem of the bodies by 12.40pm and handed them over to relatives.        
	According to him, 19 passengers of the bus died before they could be brought to the hospital. Of the 54 who were admitted with injuries, 34 were referred to other hospitals.        
	The lone ambulance of the hospital broke down on Sunday making it difficult to shift patients to other hospitals, added the superintendent.        
	Relatives of victims erupted in anger when transport minister Ranjit Kundu visited the hospital on Monday. The police and security forces had to escort Kundu back to his car, said witnesses.         
	The minister later said at Writers Buildings that patrolling must be intensified on highways. Traffic should be manned more effectively. However, it is not possible to post traffic guards at every gap in the divider. I shall discuss the matter with senior police officers.         
	Kundu also pointed out that the bus was carrying 86 passengers. According to traffic law, no one is allowed to travel on the roof of a bus but that is going on.        
	Congress legislator and member of the standing committee on transport, Manas Bhuniya, who also visited the Uluberia hospital, said he would soon sit with PWD minister Kshiti Goswami and senior police officers to install traffic signals, build underpasses and post traffic guards on National Highway 6.

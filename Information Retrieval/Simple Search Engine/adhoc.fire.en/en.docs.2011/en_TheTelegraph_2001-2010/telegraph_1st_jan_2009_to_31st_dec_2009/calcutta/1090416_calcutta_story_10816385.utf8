The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Safety cap for dump
                                                                                                               Safety cap for dump
  - Dhapa plot to be shut          DEEPANKAR GANGULY AND JAYANTA BASU                          The garbage mound at Dhapa has become 10 storeys high. A Telegraph picture                                         
	The garbage dump at Dhapa is set for a World Bank-funded makeover that would reduce the pollution it causes. If the central clearance for the Rs 36-crore scheme comes through, the site will be closed next March.        
	The proposed scientific remediation of the dumping site  the second such project in the country after one in Andhra Pradesh  will be a joint initiative of the central and the state governments. The World Bank has agreed to provide 85 per cent of the cost as soft loan.        
	According to the plan, the project will be implemented by the state pollution control board over five years once the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) hands over the 8.2-acre landfill site by April 2010. The land will be returned to the CMC after the project is completed for non-commercial use.        
	The project is about to get the nod. However, we are still negotiating with the World Bank and a formal clearance is expected only after the next Union government takes charge, said M.L. Meena, the state environment secretary, who has spearheaded the discussion on behalf of the state.        
	As part of a pre-implementation study, two agencies have been commissioned by the environment and forest ministry to assess the environmental and social impact.        
	The possible effects of the project on the climate, topography, geology, air and noise quality, water quality and the flora and fauna and the rehabilitation model for ragpickers in the area have been analysed.        
	A study is on to explore the potential to tap methane gas from the landfill site and its commercial use by the civic body. The objectives of the scheme are to prevent emission and contamination of ground and surface water with waste.        
	The garbage mound is as high as a 10-storey building and will remain a source of perpetual pollution unless steps are taken immediately. Toxic chemicals and bacteria may get mixed with the soil in the surrounding area, resulting in spread of diseases.        
	Remediation of the landfill site has become an immediate necessity because east Calcutta has seen rapid urbanisation with hotels, eateries and healthcare facilities mushrooming all around. Besides, Calcuttas first off-the-river water treatment plant has also been planned in the area, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.        
	According to experts, the numerous bheris in the area may also be contaminated if the dumping site is not capped. Landfill capping effectively manages human and ecological risks associated with a dumping site, said Shyamal Adhikari, a senior environment engineer of the state pollution control boards waste management cell.        
	As part of the scheme, he explained, the garbage mound will be dressed in high-density polyethylene and then covered by a layer of earth, where vegetation such as grass and short-rooted plants will be grown. An effective drainage system is also needed. The CMC has been dumping nearly 4,000 tonnes of garbage daily at the site for the past 25 years, said chief engineer (conservancy) Arun Sarkar.        
	The civic body has two other landfill sites, measuring 13.2 acres and 10 acres, near Dhapa. The 10-acre site is being developed for use once the site currently in use is shut down.

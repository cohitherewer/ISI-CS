                      Flight of creativity                    It is perhaps for the first time that Calcuttans will have the opportunity of viewing an ensemble of contemporary textiles in patterns that are traditional yet experimental, bold yet sleek, intricate yet chic. Created by textile designer Shambhavi, A Conference of Birds (a collection of woven masterpieces on show), presents 40 fabrics with singular designs in a mixed palette of colours from soft pastels and subdued tones to bright, gorgeous shades. Weaving together a free-flowing world of birds as in the great Sufi poem, The Conference of Birds, by Attar, the designer has attempted to recreate the timelessness of traditional costumes by using ancient symbols and motifs. Many a mythological tale is suggested through these motifs that reinterpret and blend traditional beliefs with modern aesthetics. Shambhavis creative spirit appears to soar along with the flight of her birds, rising above the mundane to ensconce it in the realms of fantasy. Her meticulously woven saris, stoles and drapes define her idea of sartorial elegance in these unstitched, ready items of clothing.                  Event: An exhibition of woven textile art by Shambhavi When: February 5; 6 pm - 9 pm and February 6 amp; 7; 12 noon - 8 pm Where: Rabindranath Tagore Centre, ICCR, 9A Ho Chi Minh Sarani

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sale amp; the city is shop-stop SOS
                                                                                                               Sale amp; the city is shop-stop SOS
  - Brands big and medium slash prices to loosen purse strings; extended end-of-season window revives racks          A STAFF REPORTER                          SALE CITY: The price-slash signs are bringing shoppers back. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                        
	Watch out, the city is on sale!        
	Shoppers stops in town are falling back on the four-letter word to woo buyers and beat the winter blues. Retailers big and medium have made 50 per cent off the new catch phrase of Calcutta to loosen the purse strings.        
	In the bargain, every excuse from New Years Day to Republic Day is being used to get in the crowds. Shoppers Stop had a special four-day Republic Day dhamaka from January 23. The current sale is keeping in mind the customers buying habits and the economic scenario. Sales figures have definitely gone up over the extended weekend, says Naveen Misra of Shoppers Stop.        
	An anaemic autumn-winter season, which under normal circumstances yields almost twice the value of business transacted during the spring-summer window, say retailers, had forced many brands to go on sale prematurely and there is no sign of the sale season ending in a hurry. For the SOS sale sign is luring shoppers and reviving the retail racks.        
	Malls wore a house-full look this four-day weekend after weeks of lull. We hope this will be the turning point for retailers that had suffered a full stop post-Puja. Even brands that dont usually slash prices are doing it now. Footfall at the mall has gone up by 40 per cent and the conversion ratio has gone up significantly, says Manmohan Bagree of South City Mall.        
	With customer response being termed extremely encouraging by the big players, retailers are allowing themselves a smile again. With market sentiment at a never-before low this winter, most brands didnt have an option but to switch to sale mode. It has worked wonders, says Madhusudan Binani, a franchisee for the likes of Benetton, Allen Solly and Satya Paul.        
	With the sale window sure to remain open much longer than normal this time, some brands are eyeing a jump in season-end figures. We normally do around Rs 15 lakh per month on an average at the City Centre Adidas store. This January, we expect sales to cross Rs 25 lakh, says franchisee Kamal Jain, adding that cumulative business for this winters sale period, extending till end-February for some brands, could reach a new high.        
	The Calcutta shopper, reluctant to reach for his pocket between Puja and Christmas, is ready to make hay while the sale signage shines. Usually sales get over by January 15 but the season is too bad to stop the sale. People are buying again and no one wants to miss out, says Pulkit Baid of Great Eastern Technocity on Sarat Bose Road.        
	The customer, suddenly going from pauper to prince, is not complaining. Sourav and Chitra, a young couple at City Centre, said: We bought clothes worth Rs 5,500 for Rs 3,000. This is the first feel-good weekend in weeks.

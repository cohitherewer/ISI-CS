           Babu bother: The photograph of Writers Buildings with mounds of dust-laden files speaks volumes about the work culture of babus, who are now being showered with additional pay and perks at the cost of taxpayers (Picture of a Writers Buildings office captioned Strike toll, March 5). But no amount of wage benefits is going to improve their efficiency. Hence the state should freeze future increments of government employees till there is significant improvement in their work culture. Bengals trade union netas could perhaps be sent to the Tamil Nadu or Gujarat secretariat to see the work culture there, said to be fast, efficient and largely corruption-free.                                     
	The harassment suffered by readers at National Library because of protesting library staff is very unfortunate and deserves strong condemnation (Readers bear brunt of Library agitation, February 26).           
	It is our shame that we live in a state where strikes, shutdowns, road blockades and agitations are considered by political parties and their unions as the principal means of fulfilling their vested interests.           
	Consequently, the general people suffer.           
	The promotion or demotion of library employees, or any other administrative matter, should not be allowed to victimise hapless readers.           
	This institution of learning has borne the brunt of many scandals, like the incident of pilferage or loss of important periodicals.           
	The authorities should ensure quality service to readers at National Library and arrest its further decline since it is one of the citys heritages.                     
	Ratan Kumar Halder,
  Behala                       
	Apropos Buddha bats for Besu, February 26, it is unfortunate that chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had to write to human resource development minister Arjun Singh to reconsider the Centres decision not to upgrade the Bengal Engineering amp; Science University (Besu) to an Institute of National Importance (INI).             
	It is known to all that the Left-backed students union has tarnished the educational atmosphere on campus and wasted many days of the academic sessions.           
	Arjun Singh has taken the right decision in not upgrading Besu to an INI presently, considering the illegal activities that were taking place regularly on the Shibpur campus. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee should advise the Left-backed students union members to mend their ways immediately.           
	Sukumar Ghosh,
  Mukundapur                               
	It is shocking that a Higher Secondary examinee was beaten up by a hooch gang for raising his voice against them (Teen assault by hooch gang, March 2). The incident underscores how police is dragging their feet in destroying liquor dens. It is evident that corruption within the administration is responsible for the continuation of such illegal activities.             
	Accolades to Chiranjit Sinha, who bravely protested against the culprits and faced their wrath to rid society of this evil. It is sad that our society lacks more youths like Chiranjit. There is also no help from the government in rooting out such evils. The government should shake off its apathy and remember its responsibility of helping form a better social order.           
	R.K. Halder, 
  Behala             
	Apropos Citu scare at City Centre, March 2, the turf war between the CPM and the Citu over billboard advertising near the Salt Lake mall shows that for ruining the once-monolithic CPM, the Trinamul victory in the Bishnupur (West) Assembly bypoll or the meeting of Pranab Mukherjee and Mamata Banerjee is not required  the Lefts own cadres and frontal organisations can do the damage.             
	Chameli Pal,
  Batanagar             
	Apropos the report Teenager drowns while saving friends, February 24, it was saddening to learn of the tragic death of a young man, who drowned after saving the lives of two friends. Given that numerous people drown every year, schoolchildren could be given swimming lessons during vacations.             
	P. Agarwala, 
  Nadia             
	Laughter is the best medicine against depression and stress caused by the economic meltdown (Laughter therapy for downturn blues, March 2). It is the best therapy to keep our minds free and refreshed. Instead of taking costly medicines, we may take recourse to the natural and automatic laughing therapy to cure us of mental ailments.             
	Membership of a laughing club is definitely of great help, to every age group. But in the absence of such a club in any locality, some persons  kids, youths as well as the aged  may assemble in an open space regularly to undertake laughter therapy.           
	We must laugh freely, loudly and jointly. It is true that under normal circumstances we cannot laugh loudly. In schools and colleges, students may be advised to take this therapy for some time daily before the beginning or at the end of classes.           
	Dinabandhu Mukherjee,
  Behala             
	A Madhyamik candidate, Madhumita Khanra, was severely injured in a road accident during her examinations (Hospital is exam centre for car-hit girl, March 3). She was admitted to Howrah district hospital, from where she took the rest of her exams, narrating the answers to a writer under the supervision of invigilators.             
	It is highly appreciable that the district inspector of schools provided support to Madhumita. All students must be provided help and support if he or she falls sick, gets injured or is in agony during exams.           
	Bhupen Bose
  Dum Dum Park             
	Apropos In the name of the father, February 27, it is good to learn that Martin Luthar King III, the son of legendary civil rights leader Martin Luthar Junior, took a trip around Calcutta to commemorate the 50th anniversary of his fathers pilgrimage to India. Martin Luthar King Junior is held in high esteem by millions all over the world. He had profound respect for Mahatma Gandhi and his doctrine of non-violence. Given that the world is beset with terrorism, violence and distrust, the ideals of love, non-violence, peace and brotherhood propounded by Gandhi have become even more relevant today.

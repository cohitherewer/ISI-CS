The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rap on mall mob minus auto goons
                                                                                                               Rap on mall mob minus auto goons
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Battered billboards off City Centre. (Sanat Kumar Sinha)                                  
	The CPM showcaused two Citu leaders and one of its own for Sundays billboard battle near City Centre but got cold feet when it came to disciplining the auto drivers who allegedly kickstarted it.        
	Most of the auto drivers who operate in Salt Lake are from outside. Many of them do not have proper papers. We will have to rein them in but that is easier said than done, Biswajiban Majumder, the chairman of Bidhannagar Municipality, told Metro.        
	A group of alleged Citu supporters, including auto drivers, had pulled down hoardings near City Centre and stopped vehicles headed for the malls parking lot on Sunday afternoon. The show of strength came hours after Citus Salt Lake office was gutted in a fire allegedly sparked by CPM workers who had been stopped from putting up billboards the previous night.        
	The 1,600sq ft Citu building housed the offices of the Citu-affiliated taxi, autorickshaw and rickshaw unions.         
	The CPMs district secretariat slapped notices on local committee member Niloy Ghosh and Citu leaders Sumon Ghoshal and Pramod Jha on Monday. We have decided to take disciplinary action against them if their replies are found to be unsatisfactory, a party leader said.        
	Ghoshal is the general secretary of the Citu-affiliated auto union and Jha his counterpart in the taxi union. The seven persons arrested during and after the fracas have been remanded in judicial custody till Friday.        
	I dont think this is a political issue. This is more of a personal conflict between groups of miscreants trying to gain control over the City Centre area. We have convened an emergency meeting to ascertain whether our party members were associated with Sundays violence or not, said Pronab Banerjee, the secretary of the CPMs Salt Lake 1 committee.        
	A letter from the Outdoor Advertising Association to the municipality chairman complained about extortion by both CPM and Citu supporters. We want the municipality to take prompt action, said Nirmal Thakur, the chairman of the association.        
	Majumder admitted that Salt Lake had illegal billboards. On paper, there are 185 hoardings in Salt Lake. Ward number 5 (including City Centre) is supposed to have 29 hoardings but the actual number is higher. A survey will be conducted, he said.        
	Sundays incident had given shoppers a scare. Vijay Dwiwedi, the CEO of City Centre, said: Nobody wants such a thing to happen, not just at City Centre but at any place.

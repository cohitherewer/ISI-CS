                The state pollution control board will hand over Rs 10,000, which it had collected as fine from the Income Tax Officers Association for flouting sound norms, to Pradip Debnath, who was beaten up for protesting the use of loudspeakers in Chandernagore in 2007. Debnath had objected to the playing of songs by a Jagaddharti puja committee. He is undergoing treatment.     The high court on Friday asked the state whether it was opposed to a CBI probe into the mass felling and sale of trees at Botanic Garden in Shibpur in August 2008. The state said it would file its reply after the court-appointed inquiry committee visited the garden again and filed a report. The court then asked the panel to visit the site and file a report.    A number of blocks in Salt Lake, including BG, CC, CD, DD, BD and AD, faced water shortage on Friday because of power failure at the pump house of water tank 3. Civic officials said supply might be disrupted on Saturday, too.    Mohammad Hamid Iqbal Khan, arrested on February 4 for trying to circulate fake notes, was sentenced to 10 years rigorous imprisonment on Friday.    Former CBI officer Parthasarathi Basu, arrested while he was allegedly taking bribe, was granted bail on Friday.    The Eastern Railway will extend the EMU service between Sealdah and the airport for two more months from March 1.

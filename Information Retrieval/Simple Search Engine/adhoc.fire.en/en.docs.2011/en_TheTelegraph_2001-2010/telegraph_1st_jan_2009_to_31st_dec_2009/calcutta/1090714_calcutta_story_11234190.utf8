	Rahul Paswan, whose father works in a sweet shop, is nurturing hopes of a bright future.         
	I want to join the army to protect the country against terrorist attacks, said the boy, who lives in a shanty in Taratala.         
	Bhim Mondals father is a daily wage labourer. He lives in a hut made of bamboo planks and plastic sheets, but wants to rid society of ills. The frequent fate of children like us is to drop out of school and start working, said the 12-year-old.         
	For children like Rahul and Bhim, learning centres like Nabadisha, run by Calcutta police, offer a ray of hope.         
	On July 4, Bhim participated in a play called Banglar Mukh, staged at the Alipore Bodyguard Lines auditorium, as part of Wriddhi, the annual cultural programme of Nabadisha. The play portrayed the way the daughter of a domestic help becomes the victim of her employers lust.         
	Calcutta police now run 35 centres like Nabadisha, started in 1997 to promote education among street children. It also provides training in song, dance and drama.        
	The evening started with a patriotic song, followed by children dancing to Rang de Basanti and ended with the staging of a play, Banglar Mukh. It is the first time that I am performing on stage. I even got a medal. All the credit goes to my teachers, said 12-year-old Sana Khatoon.         
	Theatre personalities Rudraprasad Sengupta and Dwijen Bandyopadhyay, present on the occasion, invited the children to attend the staging of their plays.         
	Calcutta police want to increase the number of Nabadisha centres to 40 in a few months. We started with 11 centres. Now we have 3,000 children, said an officer of Calcutta police.         
	Most of the centres are located beside police stations. Our officers identify the children from the streets, most of whom do not attend formal schools, he added. NGOs like Vikramshila Education Resource Society, Hope Kolkata Foundation and Womens Interlink Foundation provide the teaching materials.         
	About six months ago, Calcutta police started another project called Kiran, where marginalised children are given a three-month course in computer applications.        
	The project has centres in Beniapukur, Garden Reach and Karaya and we plan to open about three more centres at Jorasanko and Ultadanga in the next few months, said the officer.

	Youth for peace  
	Twenty-three youths from Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka attended a five-day workshop, titled South Asian Youth for Peace in Nepal in June. Of these, four were from India.         
	The workshop was organised by NGO Asian Resource Foundation, Nepal. It addressed the challenges faced by the youth in south Asia.         
	The students, aged between 18 and 25 years, participated in various interactive tasks, including drawing their own model of a peaceful world. The workshop saw religious leaders from various faiths  including Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity, Islam and the Bahai  speak on peace. The participants also presented a peace declaration, formulated by themselves, to the Prime Minister of Nepal.

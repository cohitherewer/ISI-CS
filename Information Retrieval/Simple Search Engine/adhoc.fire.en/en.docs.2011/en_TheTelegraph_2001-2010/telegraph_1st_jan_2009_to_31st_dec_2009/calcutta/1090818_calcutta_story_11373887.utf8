The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Lifer flees on way to hospital
                                                                                                               Lifer flees on way to hospital
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A dacoit serving a life term at Dum Dum Central jail ran away while being taken to R. Ahmed Dental College and Hospital in Moulali by two constables on Monday afternoon.        
	Mohammad Rafique alias Chachu, who had not been handcuffed, shook off the State Armed Police men, ran through the traffic on busy AJC Bose Road, vaulted over the divider railing and disappeared in the direction of NRS Medical College and Hospital, said witnesses.        
	Rafique was arrested in the early 90s in connection with a series of robberies. He was convicted and sentenced in 1996. According to sources, the jail authorities were considering recommending Rafiques name for parole. If he is caught, he may have to serve another life term, said a criminal lawyer.         
	Joint commissioner (headquarters) Jawed Shamim said: Rafique will have to face fresh charges when he is caught. We have alerted our counterparts in the districts.         
	On Monday, Rafique, who was suffering from a tooth infection, and two other jail inmates charged with petty crimes, were sent to hospital in a prison van, guarded by three constables. After a constable accompanied the other two jail inmates to RG Kar Hospital, the van proceeded to the dental hospital with the rest.         
	The constables got off the van with Rafique in front of the hospital. The convict was not handcuffed. His waist was not tied with a rope, as is the practice when a prisoner or an undertrial is taken out of jail. The constables were holding the convicts arms, said an officer of Muchipara police station, where a complaint was filed.        
	The constables said in their statement that Rafique broke free as they were about to enter the hospital.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Callousness and laxity give licence to kill
                                                                                                               Callousness and laxity give licence to kill
          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI AND ZEESHAN JAWED                                            
	Calcutta has a million vehicles jostling for space on thoroughfares whose combined length is 22 times less than that of Delhis roads. But callousness rather than congestion is the number one killer on the citys roads. Metro scans traffic records to probe the principal reasons why 462 lives were lost in road accidents in 2008.        
	Licence for a lark        
	Metro had demonstrated in December 2007 how a reporter who had never driven a car in his life had managed to get a driving licence through a tout at the public vehicles department  for a bribe of Rs 3,000 and a pack of cigarettes  without having to get behind the wheel even once.        
	Despite promises of crackdown and clean-up, nothing has changed since. Tout raj cholchhe cholbe, shrugged a cop on duty near the Beltala address.        
	Motor driving schools have mushroomed but most of these dont have proper training cars and qualified instructors. They often bribe employees of the public vehicles department to get licences for their clients without even a test.        
	The driving school I had enrolled with said I could get a licence for a fee, but I insisted on a test. That turned out to be such a farce, with the PVD official too busy extorting money from those not coming through a motor school to even check how I was driving, said Pritam Das, 24.        
	With ill-trained drivers steering vehicles small and large, lane driving and correct signalling are alien to the citys road culture. In Mumbai, the car behind you will brake when you brake. In Calcutta, the driver behind you will instantly veer to the left at the risk of hitting a car in the adjacent lane, says techie Manas Adhikari, who shifted to the city last year.        
	According to transport consultant S.M. Ghosh, many drivers technically know only how to start the vehicle, get it going and bring it to a halt. The manner in which untrained drivers are let loose on the roads is most dangerous, he says.        
	Law loopholes        
	If recklessness is a habit with many drivers  and pedestrians  police seem programmed to look the other way. Many drivers responsible for fatal accidents are never traced; those who are caught get away with fines that hardly pinch the pocket. Jaywalking draws a spot fine of Rs 10-50, rash driving by taxis, private car and two-wheelers a rap of Rs 400, bus and mini-bus Rs 800, and goods vehicles Rs 2,000.        
	Can this ever act as a deterrent? demands a retired police officer. There have been several moves to try and raise the fine to figures that would hurt the offender and dissuade others. But vote-bank politics and union raj have thwarted every move.        
	Even a driver charged with rash and negligent driving is booked under Section 279 of the IPC, which is a bailable offence. Very few offenders spend even a night in jail. The conviction rate in road accident cases is less than four per cent, says a senior IPS officer. Without exemplary punishment, the death toll on the roads will never come down.        
	Rule rebels        
	There is a kind of consensus among drivers, commuters and pedestrians in the city that road rules are meant to be broken. While reckless driving remains the main cause of road deaths, pedestrians are to blame as well. The general attitude towards traffic rules is our biggest problem. No one seems to care simply because they are allowed to get away with it, says a retired police officer, ruing the absence of harsh punitive measures.         
	Reckless rogues        
	In a city where traffic is perennially in stop-start-stop mode, rash driving is not always about stepping on the accelerator. You can be at 20kmph and be guilty of rash driving, says a traffic officer.        
	Many blame the commission system for accidents involving buses, but traffic personnel argue that speed does not kill as much as the propensity of bus drivers to flout traffic rules and grab right of way.        
	Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty announced last week that the commission system would be abolished but that will not help till drivers are trained better and measures to curb reckless driving are given more muscle.        
	Road fault        
	According to experts, the majority of Calcuttas accident-prone roads are defective or potholed. The narrow arteries that join thoroughfares are the real accident hotspots of the city, created by poor planners, says a police officer.

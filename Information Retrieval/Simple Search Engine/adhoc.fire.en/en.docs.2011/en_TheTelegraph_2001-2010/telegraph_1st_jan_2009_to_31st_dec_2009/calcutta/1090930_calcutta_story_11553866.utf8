The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | North gap on Mamata puja map
                                                                                                               North gap on Mamata puja map
          SUDESHNA BANERJEE                          WOULD SHE HAVE GONE IF MULLICKBARI WAS UP NORTH?: Mamata Banerjee with Ranjit Mullick at his Bhowanipore puja on Saptami. (Amit Datta)				                                 
	Mamata Banerjee stands accused by puja organisers in north Calcutta of favouring their southern counterparts throughout Puja 2009.        
	The scoreboard says it all: 10-plus vs 0. As in, Mamata went to a host of south Calcutta pujas between Saptami and Navami, but not a single one north of Bhowanipore.        
	Did that come as a surprise to north Calcutta pujas given the Calcutta South MPs present brand of politics?        
	We are more shocked than surprised that Didi did not come to the north pujas. She is not just a representative of south Calcutta, but also a senior Union minister who is being seen as the leader of the whole of Bengal, burst out a puja organiser in the north.        
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who does not go pandal-hopping, cannot be accused of geographical bias on this count, but he has often expressed anguish over south Calcutta being pampered and the north being neglected.        
	So, why did the so-called chief minister in waiting pass up the chance to vault the south-north divide with her festive moves? Trinamul veterans who have watched Mamata on the move for years said, on condition of anonymity, that it was a deliberate ploy to embarrass Sudip Bandyopadhyay, whom she wants to keep in check.        
	The Trinamul MP from Calcutta North was under considerable pressure from pujas in his constituency to get top-draw Didi to the pandal, and her absence was a loss of face for him. Something Bandyopadhyay, of course, denied. Only Mohd. Ali Park had approached me to try and get Mamata, he told Metro.        
	The neglected north pujas dealt with Didis absence despite repeated requests with a mix of anger and anguish.        
	We did send a message requesting her to drop by any day, any time, but one has to understand that one lady cannot visit every puja in town, said Jorasanko MLA Dinesh Bajaj and an organiser of the Mohd. Ali Park puja, which was even visited by Pranab Mukherjee. But Bajaj is confident that had she visited any puja in this part of town, it would have been his landmark north Calcutta puja.         
	So, by not crossing the Chowringhee line at all, rather than picking and choosing a few, Mamata has not created festive schisms within pujas in north Calcutta. But there is no escaping the us and them divide caused up north after she visited several pandals down south, from Kidderpore to Topsia, Chetla to Ballygunge.        
	Mamata even gave the Sealdah Railway Athletic Club puja in Sealdah a miss. We did hope she would come as this puja is linked to her ministry. Perhaps she could not adjust her schedule, rued organiser Tarun Roy.         
	Another north Calcutta puja organiser was more fatalistic: She grew up in south Calcutta and has both emotional and political ties there, so she is bound to give their pujas priority.        
	A few have not given up hope yet. Who knows, Didi might still come before the idol is immersed on Wednesday, said South Dum Dum Municipality vice-chairman Sujit Bose, from his Sreebhumi Sporting Club pandal.

                      Fantasy on canvas                    A meditative painter, Dhiren Sasmal has devoted most of his artistic career towards creating a world of myth and fantasy. Adekha Dekha, the ongoing show of his paintings, finds the artist looking at the world through the innocent eyes of a child. Inspired by folk tales from around the world, his canvasses portray an imaginative vision of life. His magical, extraordinary and ethereal world of beauty is inhabited by kings, queens, princes, lonely damsels, horses, fish, birds, fairies, demons and many other earthly and unearthly creatures. What Sasmal paints is not simply an illustration of any particular folk tale. On the contrary, the stories are for him a point of departure, from where his creativity takes off. Transforming the spirit of a particular genre of fairy tale, he concentrates on analysing and bringing together the common elements in stories belonging to different traditions. But, at some level, his paintings reflect the folk sobriety of Bengal art when he works with folk tales of Bengal. They are imbued with expressionism when based on Aesops Fables or take on the Western surrealistic expression when dealing with Lewis Carrolls Alice in Wonderland. Ultimately, Sasmal achieves pure visual harmony by envisaging the world through the consciousness of a child.

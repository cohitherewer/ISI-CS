The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Protest after sack
                                                                                                               Protest after sack
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A group of Citu supporters locked the gates of a wholesale distribution unit of ITC in Watgunge on Monday morning after the authorities decided to sack one of the employees.        
	The authorities later lodged a diary with Watgunge police, seeking security to resume work. We have started a probe, said an officer of Watgunge police station.        
	Pankaj Lilha, the director of the distribution unit, said this was not the first time the CPMs labour wing had stopped work. I was earlier heckled by members of the trade union and was also forced to pay Rs 7,500 to the party fund, he said.        
	Sources said problem started after Lilha served a job termination notice to shadow supervisor Nawab Hedayat Ullah Khan last week.        
	ITC has scrapped the post of shadow supervisor. As a result, Khan and other shadow supervisors were served with a three-month termination notice that ended in April, said Subrata Dey, the area executive of Calcutta circle 1 of ITC.        
	But Khan refused to leave even after Lilha arranged for him to work in a friends office. The authorities cannot sack me like this, he said.

	The doe missing from the state governments animal rescue centre was poached for meat or skin with the help of insiders, forest department officials and policemen believe.         
	Bloodstains were found in the deer enclosure at the two-hectare centre near Calcutta Armed Police camp in Salt Lake, indicating the seven-year-old blind doe was killed, said the police. The blood samples have been sent for tests.        
	It seems the doe was killed and carried out of the compound, said chief wildlife warden S.B. Mandal.        
	Apart from another doe, the sibling of the missing one, there are star turtles, rhesus monkeys and several types of birds at the centre, which has also served as a deer research facility for 30 years.        
	Range officer Arabinda Roy lodged a complaint with Bidhannagar North police station and alerted the forest department after the doe could not be traced on Saturday morning.        
	Four guards of the private agency responsible for the centres security  Dinabandhu Bar, 27, Sujit Barman, 23, Bikash Barman, 18, and Biplab Barman, 21  were arrested on Sunday and charged under the Wildlife Protection Act.         
	The four, residents of Basanti in South 24-Parganas, claimed they were asleep on Friday night. Sujit and Dinabandhu have been posted at the facility for five years and the other two for two years. They were remanded in police custody till July 4.        
	Investigators are checking whether the four had links with poaching rackets based in Basanti and active in the Sunderbans.         
	The additional principal chief conservator of forest, P.K. Roy, said: We are taking this seriously since this is the first time an animal has gone missing from a state government facility.         
	A forest department official said a committee had been formed to investigate the incident. It is expected to submit its report in 15 days.        
	Metro took a walk around the centre to find the iron mesh fence with barbed wire on top missing at a number of places at the back of the compound.         
	A forest department nursery, adjoining the Baisakhi footbridge, allows trespassers easy access to the centre, where deer enclosure is only kept bolted, and not locked, at night.        
	The nursery door is not locked and a number of people enter the nursery and then sneak into the backside of the centre especially at night, said a guard at the nursery.        
	After the doe went missing, cops have surveyed the area several times, he added.

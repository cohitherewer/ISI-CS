Jazz enthusiasts are being offered a wide variety of listening choices, ranging from traditional jazz beats, jazz-funk and jazz-rock to a blend of fusion, touching on Indian classical music, with participating groups from Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and the US. Featuring performances of an experimental nature, a hallmark of this annual fest, it also showcases the return to Calcutta of the American trio Beatlejazz with percussionist Brian Melvin in the lead, Dutch trumpeter Saskia Laroo (picture along), the duo of German guitarist Wolfgang Netzer and sarod player Ranajit Sengupta and the Mumbai-based Interplay, featuring some of the best-known names in contemporary jazz in India. This evening the fusion group of Netzer and Sengupta will perform in the company of percussionist Ratul Shankar. This will be followed by the Barcelona-based Jaime Vilaseca Quartet, a cutting-edge band in European contemporary jazz. Tomorrows programme is dedicated to the memory of city-based vibraphonist/pianist Anthony Menezes, who died in August.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two men were arrested on Thursday night on the charge of raping a job aspirant in a south Calcutta hotel.         
	The accused  Asish Kar and Gautam Purakayet, in their 40s  have been remanded in police custody for a week.        
	The victim stated in her complaint with Gariahat police station that Kar had asked her to meet him at Ballygunge Place on the pretext of giving her a receptionists job.        
	The woman had given her phone number to several people saying she was desperate for a job, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters).        
	When the woman turned up at the designated spot on Thursday evening, Kar asked her to accompany him to a hotel where one of his friends, who would help her get the job, would come.         
	In the hotel room, the two started making ugly gestures at me and then raped me. I could not scream as they had gagged me, the woman said in her complaint. The woman raised a hue and cry after leaving the room around 10.30pm, after which hotel employees detained the duo. They were arrested following a complaint lodged by the woman.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Flu suspect leaves hospital
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The parents of a three-year-old swine flu suspect from the US walked away with her from Infectious Diseases Hospital, Beleghata, after being sent there from the airport on Monday.         
	The health department requested the US consulate in Calcutta to track down the family and convince the parents to admit the girl to the hospital.        
	Mehek Sinha Roy was running a temperature when she landed at the airport along with her parents. They were escorted to the hospital so that Mehek could be quarantined. Her parents, however, decided that she would not be able to stay in the isolation ward and took her away.        
	The Sinha Roys are residents of Houston in the US. They flew to Calcutta via Dubai on an Emirates airline flight around 8am. During a routine screening at the immigration counter, health officials found that Mehek had a cold and fever and was also coughing.        
	We referred her to Beleghata ID Hospital. Doctors and other staff members accompanied the family, said a senior official of airports health department.         
	They reached the hospital around 9.30am and were taken to the isolation ward. According to sources, Meheks father Dipankar did not want his daughter to stay in the mosquito-infested ward.        
	They went away from the hospital and we are trying to find them. We have contacted the US consulate since they are US nationals and sought its help in getting the girl back to the quarantine ward, a senior official of the state health department said.        
	Mehek was not brought back to the hospital till late on Monday.         
	In June this year, 46-year old Sutapa Bhattacharya, a homemaker from Kalyani, had walked out of the isolation ward, only to be brought back 44 hours later. Sutapa had returned from a family holiday in Singapore with fever.        
	Eight health officials had gone to her home and forced her to accompany them back to Beleghata.         
	Swine flu suspects who were admitted to Infectious Diseases Hospital had complained of dirty beds, unclean toilets and rats and cockroaches. We have created separate wards with airconditioning and things have improved since the outbreak of the disease, said a hospital official.

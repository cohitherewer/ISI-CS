The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Gang war hint in youth death
                                                                                                               Gang war hint in youth death
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Police on Wednesday lodged an unnatural death case following the discovery of 20-year-old Sunny Setts body on the roof of a building near his house in MC Ghosh Lane on Tuesday evening.        
	A preliminary examination of the body  the detailed post-mortem report is yet to reach the police  revealed that Sunny, who was an electrician, died of a gunshot wound in his right temple.        
	Family members of Sunny have alleged that he was murdered. But we are not ruling out suicide, said a senior officer of Howrah police.         
	A probe revealed that two shots had been fired on Tuesday. The police have recovered one shell from the spot and a live cartridge from Sunnys trousers.        
	Initially, it appeared to be a case of suicide. But later we learnt that Sunny had a criminal background and some local residents had seen four men rush out of MC Ghosh Lane right after a gun was fired. We are probing if the death was a fallout of gang rivalry, said the officer.        
	The MC Ghosh Lane area has been witnessing a realty boom over the past few years, with local gangs vying with one another to extort money from promoters or bag supply contracts, the police said. The police have grilled a young man and a young woman, both believed to be Sunnys friends.        
	The girl told us she was in a relationship with Sunny but everything was alright between them, said an officer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Court rejects DYFI plea
                                                                                                               Court rejects DYFI plea
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          The DYFI rally on the Maidan on December 20                                  
	The DYFI on Thursday pleaded with the high court for six more weeks to identify the cadres who had lit chullahs on the Maidan during a rally on December 20.        
	But the division bench of Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya and Justice Tapan Kumar Dutta gave the CPMs youth wing only four weeks.        
	On February 9, environment activist Subhash Dutta had submitted photographs to the court showing how some cadres had violated a ruling by cooking on the greens during the rally.        
	The court started contempt proceedings against the DYFI for flouting the ban on cooking within 3km of Victoria Memorial. As part of the proceedings, the DYFI was served with a show-cause notice, the reply to which was to be submitted on Thursday.        
	But the DYFIs lawyer Tarun Roy said: Before replying to the notice, the organisation has to find out whether those who had lit up the chullahs were its cadres or not. The process is on and we need at least six more weeks to complete it.        
	The lawyer admitted that the process got delayed after the announcement of the Lok Sabha poll schedule.        
	But the division bench rejected Roys argument, saying the court had nothing to do with the DYFIs problem. We are giving you four weeks to submit the affidavit stating what action you had taken against the offenders, the court ruled.        
	A leader said the DYFI had four lakh members across the state. According to a police report, around 3 lakh people had attended the rally. Its next to impossible to identify cadres on the basis of photographs, the leader said.        
	On February 8, a Left Front rally on the Maidan had again violated court norms. On Thursday, the court asked Dutta to file a petition seeking an order asking newspapers to submit photographs of the rally which they had published the next day.

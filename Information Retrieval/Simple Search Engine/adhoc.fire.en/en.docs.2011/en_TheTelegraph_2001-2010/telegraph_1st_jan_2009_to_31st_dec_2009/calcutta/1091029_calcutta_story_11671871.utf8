The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rugby glory for rookie girl gang
                                                                                                               Rugby glory for rookie girl gang
  - Team that groomed Tudu readies four for national squad in seven months           SANJAY MANDAL                          The Jungle Crows womens team that won the national championship                                        
	Jungle Crows, the Calcutta-based rugby team that groomed UK-based rising star Sailen Tudu, has given Bengal four more champions to crow about.        
	Following in the footsteps of Bankura boy Tudu, four girls who didnt know what a rugby ball looked like until seven months ago have made it to the national team after a stint with the team raised by former British diplomat Paul Walsh.        
	Railway athletes Tapasi Nandi, Sutapa Das and Kalpana Das, and Priyanka Mondal of the Sports Authority of India will soon leave for Malaysia as part of the 12-member squad for the Borneo Sevens Asian championship.        
	Till February this year, I didnt know there was a game called rugby. But when one of my friends asked whether I was interested, I said why not, Tapasi, a pole-vaulter, told Metro from the probables camp in Pune.        
	Although the Jungle Crows came into being in 2004, a girls squad was born this April. It went on to win the national championship in Delhi this month, pole-vaulting Tapasi and her three fellow athletes into the spotlight.        
	But how could four rank outsiders take up rugby and become so good at it so quickly? That we were already athletes helped. But athletics is an individual pursuit and rugby is a team game. So we did face problems initially, said Sutapa, who is from Malda.        
	Walsh said he decided to raise the Jungle Crows womens team after SAI agreed to allow some of its athletes to learn the sport. I knew that the Pune womens team was very good, and I had been wanting to give them some competition. I also wanted to popularise rugby among women in Calcutta, he added.        
	Kalyan Chowdhury, the national athletics coach for SAI, said the athletes-turned-rugby players reached the final of a tournament in Mumbai within a fortnight of learning the basics. They lost to Pune but avenged the defeat in the national championship in Delhi. They are amazing.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Arrest in kidney racket
                                                                                                               Arrest in kidney racket
          A STAFF REPORTER                   
	A 25-year-old woman was arrested from Bathna village in Shantipur, Nadia, for allegedly posing as the wife of a kidney donor who later became an operative of the nation-wide kidney racket. Police suspect that she had done the same for other donors as well.         
	Nishkriti Bala confessed to police that she had provided the mandatory consent when Hriday Kumar Dubey  whose arrest on February 2 unearthed the scam  sold his kidney in December 2007.        
	When the recipient and the donor are unrelated, the organ is removed only after a guardian of the donor gives his or her consent. A donors wife can also give consent.        
	The consent has to be recorded in a specified form available with the notary.        
	Dubey, who became a kidney racket operative, paid a paltry sum to Nishkriti for posing as his wife and providing the consent, said an officer. A team from the department arrested Nishkriti from her village on Saturday.        
	Dubey told the police that he had pocketed Rs 85,000 for donating his kidney, of which he paid Rs 10,000 to Bala. The woman, however, told the cops she got only Rs 300.        
	Investigators are checking the bank account of Nishkriti, who hails from a poor family, to figure out whether she was part of the other deals struck by the racket.        
	Dubey, who also hailed from a poor family in Fulia, had responded to an advertisement for kidney donation. We found out that the advertisement would be published by the racket to lure prospective donors. The donors would later be forced to work for the racket. That is how Dubey was sucked in. He later lured Nishkriti into the racket, said an officer.        
	Investigators became suspicious about Nishkriti while going through documents provided by private hospitals where kidney transplants were carried out in the past two years. The recipient of Dubeys kidney  the transplant was carried out in a south Calcutta hospital  could not provide any information about the donor.

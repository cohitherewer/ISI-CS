	I wish I had the power to leap through time like Makoto, exclaimed Pratiksha Khatua, a student of Calcutta Girls High School. She couldnt stop talking about the movie she had just seen at the Ninth International Childrens Film Festival, organised by Cine Central at Nandan II.         
	The festival, in its ninth edition, included Japanese movies for the first time this year. On May 27, it screened the 2006 film, The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, by director Mamoru Hosoda. The film derives its plot from a manga (comics and print cartoons in the Japanese language) story.         
	The other film in the Japanese package was Nishizawa Akios Nitaboh. Said the consul-general of Japan in Calcutta, Fujio Samukawa: Manga is a part of growing up in Japan. It is popular among children as well as adults. He plans to organise a festival of Japanese films in the city.        
	Held from May 25 to 29, the festival included 30 films from countries like the Netherlands, China, Iran and the Czech Republic.         
	 The Indian offering was Abhaya Simhas Sparrows, a film from Kerala about two children who head to the bustling city in search of their lost sparrow.         
	Cine Central started the International Childrens Film Festival in 1979. The festival was stopped due to financial reasons in 1982, but was revived in 2005.         
	The Girl, with English subtitles, made good use of graphics and colours. Unlike the usual offering of animated movies screened in India, it did not have animals, toys or characters from the fantasy world as protagonists.         
	The film traces the journey of 17-year-old Makoto, a high school student in Tokyo. Makoto exploits her ability to make time leaps to prevent undesirable situations, until she discovers that her friend Chiaki is a time traveller from the future, too. He had travelled back in time to see a painting restored by Makotos aunt.         
	Nitaboh was the story of the blind young man who went on to become the father of the Tsugaru Shamisen, a three-stringed Japanese musical instrument.         
	I am a big fan of cartoon films. This is the first time I am watching a Japanese film and I love the fantasy elements, said Moulisree Karmakar, a Class II student of Carmel Primary school.         
	This being the time of summer vacations for children, the response was very good. At times, parents and children sat through two films one after the other, said Sajal Dutta, the joint secretary of Cine Central.

	St Xaviers Colleges alumni association opened its Dubai chapter in May, notching up its third overseas presence after Singapore and Bangkok.               
	Father Felix Raj, the principal of the college and president of the alumni association, travelled to Dubai for the opening ceremony on May 29, along with association secretary Firdausal Hassan and six members.         
	Said Father Felix: St Xaviers is going global, bringing everyone under one umbrella. The alumnis interaction will bring back the Xaverian spirit, bringing service to the alma mater and to society.        
	This chapter will give ex-Xaverians in Dubai a platform to know each other, thus including them in the Xaverian family, said Hassan.         
	The inauguration ceremony was followed by an interactive session. It was great to see the ex-students come together. Everyone went back to their college days, said Uday Pachisia, a former Xaverian, now living in Dubai.         
	The Dubai chapter is another step by the association to strengthen the colleges roots. Xaverians are shining everywhere and holding our flag high, said Sameer Saraf, the assistant secretary of the association.         
	The association has also set its sights on reaching out to Xaverians in the UK and US, work on which is in the networking stage. The chapters will be launched in London and New York, respectively, before the colleges 150th year celebrations in January.         
	In London, the association hopes to include L.N. Mittal at the inauguration.        
	In India, Bangalore is the next destination.

	THE DIARY   
	This is my world  
	I am born in a world where brother fights brother,
  Where humanity cries and generations shudder.
  Where the system droops and pines,
  Where power rapes
  justice and terrorism shines.
  Where corruption is the prince,
  Where freedom lies naked to slavery ever since.
  Where misery is deaths jaws,
  Where I sob in shame,
  Where I survive
  without a cause.

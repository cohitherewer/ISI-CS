The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | April at its cruellest
                                                                                                               April at its cruellest
                                              
	On April 7 Calcutta experienced a temperature of 38.9 degrees Celsius, the warmest April 7 in 10 years. The heat led to the death of two persons in the city.         
	According to the meteorological department, the highest temperature measured in April in the last 10 years was 39.6 degrees Celsius in 2008, followed by the 38.9 degrees Celsius in 2001 and 2009.         
	But in both 2001 and 2008, the highest April temperature was recorded in the third week or later. The highest temperature in April in Calcutta is 43.3 degrees Celsius, which was recorded on April 25 in 1954.         
	Climate change could be responsible for the steep rise in temperature, but more specifically it is the absence of the Norwester.         
	Everything is related to climate change directly or indirectly. But in this case the specific reason is the absence of Norwesters, said Sutapa Chowdhury, the head of the atmospheric science department in Calcutta University.         
	Two things come together to make the Norwester blow: the Western Disturbance from Chhotanagpur and a cyclonic circulation from the Bay of Bengal, which is warm and moist. But an anti-cyclonic circulation in the Bay of Bengal is preventing the cyclonic circulation, said Chowdhury.         
	The same anti-cyclonic circulation did not allow the northern wind to enter the eastern region, leading to a very brief winter, added Chowdhury.         
	Experts at the meteorological department, however, said the absence of the Norwester is an aberration and soon it would enter the city. But Calcuttas record increase in temperature this year is in consistency with the global trend.         
	Climate model projections summarised in the latest IPCC report indicate that global surface temperature is likely to rise by 1.1 to 6.4 C during the 21st century.         
	The temperature increase in the 1990s and in the present decade has been unparalleled. Based on estimates by Nasas Goddard Institute for Space Studies, 2005 has been the warmest year since instrumental measurements became available in the late 1800s, exceeding the previous record set in 1998.         
	During 1999-2008, the mean temperature across the world has risen generally from 0.5 to 2 degrees Celsius. Calcutta experienced a rise in the range of 0.5 to 1 degrees Celsius.                     JAYANTA BASU

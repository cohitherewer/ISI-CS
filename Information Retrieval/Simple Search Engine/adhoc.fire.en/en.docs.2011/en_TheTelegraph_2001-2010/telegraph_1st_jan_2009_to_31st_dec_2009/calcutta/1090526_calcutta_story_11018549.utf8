          A STAFF REPORTER                          The auto on which a tree fell and killed Abir Mitra. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                  
	Cyclone Aila may have just missed the city but it left a trail of death and destruction, claiming at least 15 lives and causing widespread damage.        
	Jadavpur resident Abir Mitra, 36, was one of those who had braved the weather warning to keep his appointment with a diabetologist at MR Bangur Hospital.        
	He was crushed to death by a tree while returning home in an auto around noon. Mother Shanti, who was accompanying him, survived along with the other passengers.        
	Tapan Kumar Das, 46, died when a tree fell on the private bus he was in at the College Street-MG Road crossing around the same time. Das was a resident of Nilmoni Dutta Road, in central Calcutta.        
	The other injured passengers were taken to Medical College and Hospital, where the condition of three was stated to be critical.        
	Kamala Kundu, 60, died when a gust of wind sent a street lamp crashing down on her at Narkeldanaga around 12.30pm.        
	Chandra Nayek, 26, died after an iron pipe fell on his head from a building on Camac Street around 3.30pm.         
	An unidentified man in his 40s collapsed on Kripanath Dutta Road, in Chitpur, while walking through the blinding rain around 4pm. He was taken to RG Kar Hospital, where he was declared dead.        
	Another man, aged around 50, was injured in the head after a tree fell on him in Maniktala. He died on way to RG Kar Hospital.        
	Three persons  Triloka Khara, 40, Sheikh Saddam, 45, and Rani Bala Sardar, 45  were buried in the debris of mud houses that collapsed at Panchla, in Howrah.        
	An unidentified woman in Shibpur and Parulbala Roy, a 60-year-old resident of Amta, were also killed in house collapses.        
	Subir Chowdhury, 45, was electrocuted on Sarat Chatterjee Road, under Chatterjeehat police station.        
	An unidentified woman, aged around 42, was also electrocuted after coming in contact with a live electric cable that was lying on the ground at Regent Park on the southern fringes of the city.         
	A nine-year-old boy, Anikesh Singh, died after falling from the roof of his house at Mahestala when the storm was raging. Mohammad Basit, a boatman, drowned in the Hooghly near Chawkshrikrishnapur, in Sankrail.        
	The deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), Jawed Shamim, said around 32 people were injured in the city. A group of 21 slum dwellers were evacuated from their shanties on Gora Chand Road, in Beniapukur, to a school in the neighbourhood.        
	At Poddarnagar, in Jadavpur, stationery shop owner Abir Mitras inconsolable mother recalled how her son was discussing the weather just before tragedy struck.        
	He (Abir) was seated right next to me in the auto. I cant believe he is gone, wailed Shanti, 62, who was pulled out by policemen and bystanders.        
	Driver Zahir Abbas Halder, who was critically injured, is battling for life at SSKM.        
	The police said the trunk of the kadam tree crashed into the hood of the auto at the Lake Gardens crossing, on Prince Anwar Shah Road.        
	Abir, who was seated in the middle of the rear seat, apparently died instantly of head and neck injuries as the metal frame of the roof caved in and trapped the passengers.        
	His head was resting on my shoulders. I called out his name but he remained silent, said Shanti, clutching her daughter-in-law Smitas hand for support.        
	Abir and Smitas four-year-old daughter sat silently, unable to comprehend the tragedy that had befallen her and the rest of the family.

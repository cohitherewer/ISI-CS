                      A potpourri of Tagore works                    The grande dame of Rabindrasangeet, Suchitra Mitra, is all set to illuminate this evening with her presence at Rabindra Sadan when she, along with veteran reciter Subir Mitra, presents a dramatised reading of Tagores verse-drama, Karna-Kunti Sambad. Perfectionists to the core, their joint recitation sessions have always drawn tremendous appreciation. Connoisseurs are thus eagerly looking forward to this evenings performance after a long hiatus. Another attraction of this evening is a solo recital of Tagore songs by Sudeshna Chatterjee. An extremely talented singer and disciple-niece of Suchitra Mitra, Chatterjee had distanced herself from the arc lights for quite some time as she had moved abroad. However, old-timers still remember her mellifluous rendition of Rabindrasangeet. The concluding item features Anita Mullick and Koushik Chakraborty, both well-known classical dancers, as Chitrangada and Arjun, respectively, in Tagores Chitrangada, with Sasha Ghoshal and Sudeshna Chatterjee lending vocals to the dance drama. The entire programme is hosted by Shruti.                  Event: Solo Rabindrasangeet recital by Sudeshna Chatterjee; dramatised reading of Karna-Kunti Sambad by Suchitra Mitra and Subir Mitra; and dance-drama Chitrangada When: Today at 7 pm Where: Rabindra Sadan

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Here comes Slumdog... again!
                                                                                                               Here comes Slumdog... again!
  - 8 Oscars revive film in Week 5 as screens scramble to cash in on craze          PRIYANKA ROY                          Nandan, screening the Hindi version of Slumdog, witnessed a surge in footfall on Monday. (Amit Datta)                                         
	January 23, 2009: Slumdog Millionaire releases strong with close to 50 shows at city multiplexes. By the Oscar weekend, the number of Slumdog shows is down to five.        
	February 27, 2009: Slumdog stages a comeback with plexes adding shows in Week 5 to cash in on the Oscar craze.        
	With so many wins, there will be renewed interest in the film. Given the hype, we are sure people who havent seen it yet would like to come and watch it and those who have might come again, said Shravan Shroff of Fame Cinemas, which will now add at least four shows at its South City and Hiland Park addresses.        
	Other city plexes too are in talks with national distributor Fox Star Studios for more shows of the Danny Boyle success story. There were lots of enquiries about Slumdog Millionaire on Monday. The afternoon show at Forum saw a dramatic surge in footfall, said Virendra Marya, the regional director of INOX.        
	Single-screen theatres, including Metro and New Empire, will witness a re-release, of the English and Hindi (Crorepati) versions, this weekend. The unprecedented success has sparked audience interest among a wide cross-section, said Mahendra Soni of Shree Venkatesh Films, the local distributor for Slumdog Millionaire.        
	But will Slumdog really manage to get Calcutta back to the cinemas for an English film? Barring the Harry Potter series and films like Narnia and Bond, English films dont last more than a week in city theatres. Slumdog could be a turning point, said a plex official with fingers crossed.

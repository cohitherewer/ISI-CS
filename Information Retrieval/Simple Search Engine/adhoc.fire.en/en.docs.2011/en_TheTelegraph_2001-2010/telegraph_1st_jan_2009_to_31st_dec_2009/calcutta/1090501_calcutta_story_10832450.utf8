The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Poll artisans face a crunch 
                                                                                                               Poll artisans face a crunch

	Montu Patra is an election veteran since 1952. No, the 72-year-old is not associated with any political party. Painting posters and making banners used for campaigning is his bread and butter.        
	Three months before any poll, Patras workshop in Jogen Dutta Lane, behind Liberty cinema, would stir to life with the sound of hammer on wood and the smell of paper, cloth and kerosene. But not anymore. The advent of flex printing has hit his business hard. About 8,000 residents of Rambagan, engaged in the same trade, have fared no better.        
	Earlier, campaign materials would be stacked on both sides of the narrow lanes that make up Rambagan, leaving little room for pedestrians. Now, hardly anyone has orders, says Patra.        
	For this election, we are only making symbols for the parties and drawing a handful of posters. The major work is being done on flexes, he adds.         
	Earlier, the political parties would enter into a contract with the artisans. Seven to eight years back, a contract would be worth Rs 25,000 to Rs 30,000. Now publicity agents of the parties provide the material. We only get service charge, which does not cross Rs 10,000, said Santanu Majhi, another artisan.        
	Painting large posters or making giant cut-outs of politicians require skill and time. The money we got was for the skill. But now the skill is not required. So the money, too, has gone down, says Manoj Dhara, who has been in the trade for 30 years.        
	Despite the dip in remuneration the artisans never turn back any client. Come election time and they stop accepting other orders. This is our way of being part of the democratic exercise. It gives us a sense of relevance, says Patra.        
	The general elections, however, have not been all bad for the artisans. They have been flooded with orders for making replicas of the electronic voting machines. The CPM has placed orders for almost 10,000 such replicas. The replicas would be taken to various localities and people will be told where to press the button, says Samar Gayen, an artisan in the area.

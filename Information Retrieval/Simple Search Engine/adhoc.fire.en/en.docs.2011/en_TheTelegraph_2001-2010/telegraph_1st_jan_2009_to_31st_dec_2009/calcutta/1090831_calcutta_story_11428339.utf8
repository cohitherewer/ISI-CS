The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Political shift in puja power play 
                                                                                                               Political shift in puja power play     - Pandal scramble for Mamata and her men          SUDESHNA BANERJEE AND POULOMI BANERJEE                                        EXIT            Meera Bhattacharjee, the chief minister rsquo;s wife, and CPM leader Md Salim at the inauguration of a north Calcutta puja last year      ENTER            Mamata Banerjee, Pranab Mukherjee      
	The Assembly polls are some distance away but the verdict of Puja Power Play 2009 is out: a clean sweep for the non-Left.        
	Riding the palanquin into pandals this autumn is not just the Mother Goddess, according to the almanacs, but also Mamata Banerjee and her merry men, according to the organisers.        
	Glance through any VIP list being drawn up at puja control rooms, for inauguration and patronage, and the changing colourscape is obvious. Islands of red amidst a sea of green is the puja pattern this time.        
	The chime of change is the loudest in north Calcutta where CPMs Md Salim has lost the Lok Sabha battle to Trinamuls Sudip Bandyopadhyay. The last two years Salimda was our pivot. But this year (Trinamul MLA) Sadhan Pandey has helped us with sponsorships. We are hoping he will help us get Sudipda to inaugurate the puja too, says an organiser of a puja in the Hatibagan area.        
	Likhe nin, exit Salim, enter Sudip, pronounces another puja organiser.        
	Manicktalla Chaltabagan Lohapatty has traditionally been Left-friendly. Since we have a lot of social activities, Md Salim and (the chief ministers wife) Meera Bhattacharjee have been regulars at our puja, says a source, adding that Trinamuls Pandey used to be invited as a local leader, but no one was really keen on his presence.        
	That was then. This year, the para boys are desperate to get into the good books of the Trinamul. Efforts are on to get Sudip in a lead role.        
	Pujas with obvious Trinamul or Congress links are wearing the broadest smiles. Md Ali Park, where Trinamul MLA Dinesh Bajaj holds the key, will parade trump cards Mamata Banerjee and Pranab Mukherjee, on its inaugural stage. Salim was a star guest last year. He was the local MP then, Bajaj explains. This time, no invitation card bears Salims name (yet).        
	The Lok Sabha poll has thrown up new Puja candidates. The likes of Tapas Paul and Satabdi Roy have got the halo of Trinamul winners. There are lots of offers from pujas but I have not committed yet, says actor-turned-MP Paul.        
	Trinamul councillor Debashish Kumar, who steers the Manoharpukur Road puja Tridhara Sammilani, underlines the ministerial angle: CPM ministers cannot openly inaugurate pujas. So it has come as a huge relief for puja organisers to have so many (Trinamul) central ministers at hand.        
	The Union minister of state for urban development, Saugata Roy, admits that the pressure to inaugurate pujas this time is inhuman. I have received more that 50 invitations from my own constituency; calls are coming from others too. Till last year, Roy would receive four to five invites.        
	In the south, theres a scramble for the woman of the moment.        
	Mamata Banerjee always drops by at pujas in her area, says Jyoti Chatterjee of Bhowanipur Sanatan Dharmatsahini Sabha.                                      
	The citys oldest baroari puja will flaunt an all-star line-up of Siddhartha Shankar Ray, Didi, Pranabbabu and Saugatababu.        
	She offers the Ashtami anjali at our Maddox Square, confides an organiser. She has cha and prasad here on Ashtami, boasts an organiser at Sanghashri, Kalighat.        
	But getting Mamata to inaugurate the puja is the coup de grace. We are hoping she comes as our puja is linked to her own railway ministry, says Tarun Roy of Sealdah Railway Athletic Club.        
	Sitting pretty are pujas, like Singhee Park, that have got a confirmation from her. Didi told me shed come at 7pm on Panchami, said Manu Chanda, who saw a pile of puja invitations in her office.        
	The high-on-heritage Bagbazar Sarbojanin is a rare big puja taking the middle path. It will have Pranab Mukherjee and Saugata Roy at its inauguration, the local MLA and MP are both Trinamul, but CPM councillor Goutam Das is part of the puja executive committee. So Sekhar Ranjan Bhadra Chowdhury, the president of the puja, can grandstand: Durga puja is above politics.        
	If only.

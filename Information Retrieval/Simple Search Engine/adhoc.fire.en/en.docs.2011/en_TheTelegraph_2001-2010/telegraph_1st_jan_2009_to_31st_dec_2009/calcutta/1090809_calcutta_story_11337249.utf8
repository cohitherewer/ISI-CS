The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | The great sale bazaar
                                                                                                               The great sale bazaar
          Stores are offering never-heard-of discounts. Should the buyer blame  or thank  the downturn?                             Steal a deal: Showrooms at South City Mall and (below) Mani Square are giving huge discounts. Pictures by Anindya Shankar Ray                     
	The signs could be seen the moment one stepped into the mall. At Mani Square, first up was Little Shops annual sale. Further down VIP was offering up to 40 per cent discount, Woodlands promising a flat 40 per cent off on apparel and United Colors of Benetton displaying an up to 70 per cent sign as one looked up. On the floors above, the signs became more frequent.               
	If a mall is designed in such a way that every store attracts eyeballs, now they are making the eyes pop out with the discount tags dangling from every shop window. Blackberry, Reebok, Lilliput, Zapp, AND, Starmark, American Touristerone feels dizzy with discount.        
	At South City Mall, the scene is much the same. International labels, sportswear, suitcase brands, books, spectacles, sari shops and designer boutiques are all falling over each other to offer discount  one bigger than the other.        
	At City Centre too, high-end and international labels are offering mouthwatering discount, on a scale not seen in the city earlier.        
	The sale season is not restricted to the malls. Streets are covered with sale signs. At the Camac Street-Shakespeare Sarani crossing, standalone stores Levi Strauss Signature, Benetton, Wills Lifestyle and others have created a discount zone. At the Spencers hypermart in Rashbehari, a table has been placed in the middle of the grocery racks, on which are piled cotton kurtas. A giant 70% off sign dangles from the ceiling.         
	Less is more        
	End of season (summer-end, winter-end) sales are not new to the city. Retail experts say a discount works for the customer psyche. It gives buyers the courage to enter and explore. Once they get a taste, they come back for more. It breeds new customers, explains Sanjay Jhunjhunwala of Mani Square.         
	The developer tried this theory with success at Mani Square. The Ikkis Ka Dum promotional promised food items, movie tickets or other entertainment options at Rs 21 each, plus taxes. The drive transformed the fate of Mani Square, which had acquired the dubious tag of being the mall at the wrong place at the wrong time after it opened shop in the middle of the downturn last year.        
	Brands insist this year is no different. Vijay Dugar, the Bengal distributor for Reebok and Levis, says both his brands had offered similar discount in the last two years. There are two reasons behind the end of season sales: to sell old stocks and to get rid of certain products that dont sell in all sizes. That holds true for every year, he says.        
	Besides, there are huge pre-Puja discounts every year.         
	Up, up and away         
	But theres a difference in the show this year. I have never seen such huge discount across brands and stores in Calcutta before. I wonder whats driving these up to 70 per cent sales, exclaims Anita Kalra, a self-confessed shopaholic.        
	If brands insist nothings new, shop floor attendants tell a different story. An employee at Benettons Shakespeare Sarani outlet says he remembers the discount last year was up to 50 per cent. This year it is up to 70 per cent. Mufti, another apparel brand, has struck out its up to 40 per cent off sign to announce Now up to 50 per cent off. Wills Lifestyle, located close by, is offering a flat 50 per cent off  a first for this brand, says a staff member.            not for the faint-hearted      Since discount sales are a way of life now, here rsquo;s how to   make the most of them:   You need to know the market, to understand whether the discount is really as much as being promised or there are hidden costs   You usually can rsquo;t exchange stuff bought during a sale  Is it really worth it to buy three shirts for the price for two, when they look almost the same?  Or you may not want the half-its-original price salwar-kameez at all  Be ready to do some quick calculations in your head. There rsquo;s no time to pull out the calculator  Be prepared to wait mdash; at the trial rooms, at the cash counter  Avoid rush hours mdash; in the evenings, weekends and the last day of the sale. You have a better chance of shopping well if you go when few others are expected  Keep a check on your temper. The crowd, the chaos, the hours are going to make you want to snap mdash; but that will spoil the fun            Discount announcements on Shakespeare Sarani      
	The floor attendants memory could be faulty, but retail analysts point their fingers at the statistics of the downturn. The discount being offered in monsoon 2009 appears to be driven by the downturn. Retail brands have taken a big hit, particularly in the last two quarters, says Anand Ramanathan, KPMG advisory service manager.        
	Any discount above 50 per cent is not just a marketing strategy, its aimed at liquidation of stocks or clearing out the racks, he adds.        
	Taposh Bhattacharya, a textile industry expert concurs. This years discount offers are unlike any other years. The downturn has taken its toll on retail. Business is down by 15-20 per cent. So retailers are desperate to cut down the inventory because a lot of capital is blocked, he says.        
	He feels retailers are offering heavy discount to increase the cash flow. They want to get whatever returns they can on this stock and introduce a fresh collection before the festive season.        
	Desperate measures        
	The scenario is the same in other cities too, says Bhattacharya. Everyone is offering a discount. Brands like Mango and M amp;S, which are not associated with sale, are now offering huge discounts. Sportswear brands Nike, Reebok and Adidas are all offering up to 60 per cent discount. Traditionally Nike would never offer more than a 15-20 per cent off. The situation is worse abroad, where luxury brands are being forced to offer 30-50 per cent discount, says Bhattacharya.        
	Unfortunately, we do not have enough data available to say so with authority, but visually at least, it does seem that more extensive discounts are being offered this year, both in terms of number of brands going on sale and the extent of the discount offered, says Abhijit Das, a retail consultant who runs the company Lemongrass Advisors.         
	There are approximately 50 per cent more brands offering discount this year, feels Avishek Auddy, who teaches retail management and corporate strategy at the P.C. Chandra School of Business.         
	Auddy insists that these are not stock clearance sales. Stock clearance sales are given on old, last-season stocks. But these discounts are being offered on fresh stocks, he says. Stocks are not moving, sales are sluggish, he adds. Brands are desperate to have more footfalls at the stores.        
	Trying times        
	Brands at the most will concede that the drop in sales in the past year has been marginal, but admit to the success of offering discount in these trying times.        
	Sales had dropped by 10-15 per cent. But we made it up by announcing a price slash. Our earnings were worth Rs 45-50 lakh during the July 9-31 discount period. This time business during the discount period was 10 per cent more than last year, says Kamal Jain, a franchise owner of Benetton.        
	Across the retail industry, an end of season sale usually leads to a three or four-fold jump in the numbers of buys, says Amit Saha, the brand head of Turtle India.        
	A manager at Pantaloons agrees. On just the last day of the sale, we sold merchandise worth Rs 1 crore at each of our Kankurgachhi and South City outlets, he says.        
	The impact of the downturn may not always be in terms of a drop in net sales or revenue. City-specific figures are not available, but national data throws light on how organised retail has been hit by the downturn.        
	Pantaloon Retail had planned 5.9million sq ft of floor space for the financial year 2008-09, but managed to achieve only 3.8million sq ft. For the year 2009-10, it has planned to cover 8 million sq ft, but consultant firm KPMG says the retail major is expected to achieve only 4.8 million sq ft.        
	Organised retail, which was expected to comprise 16 per cent of business in 2012 from the current 5 per cent, is likely to reach just 10.4 per cent, says a KPMG survey.        
	Goenka-owned Spencers Retail has plunged into a Rs 289 crore loss in the last fiscal, as was disclosed by the company in its regulatory filing to the stock exchange. Spencers had posted a Rs 150 crore loss in 2007-08 over a turnover of Rs 812 crore. Last fiscal, it recorded sales of Rs 1,070 crore.        
	There may be too many malls. Calcutta is still a small city, with a restricted customer base. Too many malls have opened up in the past few years and more are coming up. Supply is exceeding demand, says Auddy. Few in the city are fashion conscious enough to overhaul their wardrobe every season to follow trends. The struggle for shelf-space might just become a part of Calcutta retail. And discounts too, which is the best way to get rid of surplus stock.         
	In any case, there are too many T-shirts on offer. Bare Denim is offering three T-shirts for Rs 399. Almost everyone in my office has bought these tees. Some even have the same colours. We can make it the office uniform, laughs Joyeeta Chakraborty, a media professional.        
	Temptations galore         
	The desperation may at times lead to doublespeak. Gairik Das, co-ordinator, PGP retail management, IISWBM, says that most retail outlets offer huge discounts only on their own-label (local) or smaller brands, which have little production and distribution costs. You cant play around much with national FMCG brands the way you can with own-label brands, he says.        
	Abhijit Das of Lemongrass Advisors agrees. The whole concept of sales is that it draws in the crowds. At a store offering up to 70 per cent discount, only a small percentage of merchandise will be under so much discount. The idea is that the customer will walk in and see something that he likes that might not be on sale at all and buy it. It encourages impulse buying, says Das.        
	So a lady, whose wardrobe didnt have a single designer outfit, walked into a boutique and bought a salwar-kameez set for Rs 3,500, tempted by a 50 per cent cut. Then she realised that the ensemble was everything that she wouldnt wear.         
	The discerning customer realises that he has been taken for a ride, though he might not still be able to resist the sale tag. Sambit Adhikari, 30, a Sector V techie, ordered two suits from a premier brand on seeing the 60 per cent sale tag. It was an impulse buy and I am not happy with the quality of the cloth, he rues. Sometimes a willing suspension of disbelief is required to enjoy a sale.         
	But for every single sceptic, therell be 10 others who will shop till they drop at a sale, and go home grinning from ear to ear.         
	Discount shopping may also replace partying.         
	On Friday, Sayoni and her friends were rushing to make it to Camac Street within the happy hour. Only, their destination was not a pub, it was the Benetton store at the crossing. The high-end apparel brand has come up with a novel one-for-one scheme at off hours (8am to 10am and 8pm to 11pm). And happy hour made them happy, very happy.        
	Hang on, the up to 70 per cent tag might just become a flat 100 per cent off! That means you get the object of your desire free. Hang on even more, and you may get a 200 per cent discount. That means you will be paid the price of the T-shirt for choosing to buy it.         
	But better than that is the prospect of the downturn coming to an end.                     POULOMI BANERJEE AND SAMHITA CHAKRABORTY LAHIRI

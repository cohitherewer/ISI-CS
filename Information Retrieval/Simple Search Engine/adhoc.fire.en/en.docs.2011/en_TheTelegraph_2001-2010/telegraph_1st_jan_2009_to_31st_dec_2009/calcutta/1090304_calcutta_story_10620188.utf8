	Long-distances buses with commercial goods stacked on the roof continued to ply from the city centre on Tuesday, undeterred by one such bus toppling over near Vidyasagar Setu on Monday evening.         
	A bus can carry up to 12kg luggage per passenger and cannot ferry goods for commercial purposes. The minimum fine for both offences is Rs 3,000, said a senior officer of Calcutta polices traffic department.        
	Most buses that leave Babughat and Esplanade depots for Orissa, Jharkhand and Bihar carry consignments of furniture, clothes, machinery and plastic items weighing much more than the permissible limit.        
	Often, passengers are few and porters perch on top of sacks tied to the bus roofs.        
	The main source of income for long-distance buses at Babughat depot is ferrying of commercial goods and not passengers, said a driver on one of the routes.        
	The bus operators were not bothered about fines since they had arrangements with the police, he added.        
	A middle-aged man who loads sacks on buses at Babughat said: Commercial goods are ferried on buses because taxes have to paid to carry them on trucks. The attempt is to pass off commercial goods as passengers luggage.        
	Although most of the buses leave the Babughat depot between 6pm and 9pm, the loading of the luggage on the roofs starts by noon. The charges for passengers and the luggage are almost the same on most routes, said bus operators.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Have space, will play
                                                                                                               Have space, will play
          An American city woos its children to come out and have fun. How unlike Calcutta, feels Sudeshna Banerjee                          Children practise rowing on land on Earth Day in Memphis, US. Picture by Sudeshna Banerjee                      
	Come outside and play. Handed such an invitation, a Calcuttan would challenge: Where? With empty plots giving way to brick and mortar, and playgrounds being eaten up by cricket coaching camps, space is at a premium in our bustling city.               
	That is why it was a surprise mingled with envy when a pamphlet with the message was handed over to me on the way in at Earth Day celebrations in Memphis, known to the world as Elvis Presleys lair, in the mid-south American state of Tennessee.        
	Memphis hardly lacks space compared with a bigger metropolis like San Francisco, where the houses stand cheek by jowl, almost sharing a common boundary wall (the fire department apparently requires just an inch space between two properties). Yet Memphis is Tennessees biggest city. So a comparison with our hometown is not out of place.        
	Carl Awsumb, a Memphian who visited Calcutta last January, put the matter in stark statistical perspective. With a population of about 600,000, Memphis can be accused of urban sprawl because we occupy 330 sq miles. Your population is 20 times more but you take up barely one-fifth of the space, he said, while setting up a booth at Lichterman Nature Center. That also points to how much more space a resident of Memphis gets in comparison to a Calcuttan!        
	Yet, the American needs persuasion to Come outside and play. While it would not perhaps be right to call Calcuttas children to come and play, without there being places to play, Memphis has lovely destinations. With the onset of summer, activities are rolled out in plenty, especially along the banks of the Mississippi that flows by the city.         
	Lichterman Nature Center is spread across 65 lush acres of woodlands, meadow and a lake. On Earth Day, the meadow housed dozens of booths that were scenes of green activities. Bustling about from booth to booth were little ones, carrying their green passport. They need to get the passport stamped at each counter so that their school knows that they took part in everything. They will get credit for that, says Ronda, a volunteer in charge of the live music stage.        
	At another booth, Jeanette Stone keeps organic ink and uses printouts to give kids a free hand at painting. The brushes are turkey feathers; the inks I made from berries, vinegar and oak, says the librarian, whose hobby is organic art.        
	Carl Awsumbs booth promotes sailing. Since its unsafe for children to be in the water, the Bluff City Canoe Club keeps two canoes on the grass. Yet, rowing on land can be fun too, to begin with!         
	And green activities do not start and stop on Earth Day. The forest service wing of the department of agriculture, which had a booth there, was going all out to woo citizens. A brochure offered 170,000 acres of outdoor recreation opportunities and listed a calendar of events.        
	The next weekend, we headed for National Ornamental Museum. While the centrepiece was a welding workshop where workers answer queries of visitors, the lawn by the Mississippi was abuzz. Children were buying strips of copper, engraving supplied designs with small hammers and getting the strips bent to their wrist sizes. A stones throw away under a shed, a street theatre group was performing The Ugly Duckling to an audience of parents and children. After the play, a clown appeared to blow bubbles for kids to jump about and burst. Outside stood a hillock which families on the way out climbed in fun.         
	Round the year, the Nature Center itself is a fun destination, featuring trails where families are offered Discovery Backpacks. The coming fall, the attraction for kids is 12 scarecrows lurking on the lawns, carrying messages ranging from recycling to planting. The centre also has a Backyard Wildlife Center where urban children are acquainted with live squirrels, snails and other denizens of a natural neighbourhood. When is the last time I saw any of the two in Calcutta, I wondered. Perhaps to our children, they belong as much to the forest as the tiger!        
	We try to build connections with the natural world by building a microcosm for children who are divorced from Nature. Yes, awareness is on the rise, smiled president Barry Lichterman. My son thinks fruits are born in Walmart. Thats why I brought him here, a mother had said at one of the Memphis nature parks.        
	Some children in Calcutta may be thinking along those lines too. However, all they get to do during the ongoing Forest Week is plant saplings in a derelict park. Isnt it time we gave them something to do beyond such fruitless posturing?

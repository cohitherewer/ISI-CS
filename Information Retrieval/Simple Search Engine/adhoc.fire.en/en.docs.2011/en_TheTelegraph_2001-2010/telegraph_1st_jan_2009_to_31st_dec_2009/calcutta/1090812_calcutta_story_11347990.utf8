	City-based GI Security of India has entered a first of its kind joint venture agreement with Vancouver-headquartered Canpro Global Services for setting up security training institutes across India.        
	Robert Burns, the president and chief executive officer of Canpro Global Services, and Ashit Luthra, the director of GI Security, signed the equal-partnership pact on Tuesday.        
	Ours will be the first security training course in India that will be completely web-based and beamed to classrooms nation-wide. Though each classroom will have a trainer, lessons will be broadcast through a central server, said Luthra.        
	He hoped the joint venture would make GI one of the top five private security companies in India.        
	We are in the top 20. Two years from now, we should feature in the top five, Luthra told Metro.        
	The Rs 40,000 crore private security industry in India employs 55 lakh people.        
	About Rs 10 crore would be invested in phases for the training.         
	There will be 50 centres in total, to be set up over two years. Each centre will have the capacity to train 30 guards a month. The training cost per person would be about Rs 5,000, Burns told Metro.        
	The exhaustive training module would include classroom sessions, physical training and video sessions.        
	The personnel would be trained primarily in guarding, use of sophisticated security equipment, anti-terrorism technique, disaster management and tackling post-emergency situations, said Luthra.        
	According to him, proper training of private security guards across the country could go a long way in helping police and the administration deal effectively with crime, terror and disaster.        
	Established in 1973 with headquarters in Calcutta, GI Security is one of Indias oldest security services companies. The company serves over 500 clients across the country through its 16 offices and has a presence in every state.

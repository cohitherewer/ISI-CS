The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tree trim hit by civic squabble
                                                                                                               Tree trim hit by civic squabble
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                              
	The pre-Puja tree trim in the city has been hampered this year by a stand-off between two wings of the civic body and the high court ban on 15-year-old commercial vehicles.        
	The annual trim is aimed at removing the monsoon overgrowth and facilitating the construction of pandals.        
	Mayoral council member Faiyaz Ahmed Khans parks and garden wing started the operation alone on Tuesday with Chandana Ghosh Dastidar, the mayoral council member in charge of conservancy, declaring that her department would not extend logistic support unlike in the recent past, said civic sources.         
	Following the intervention of municipal commissioner Arnab Roy, the conservancy department agreed to remove the trash generated in the operation in Calcutta proper.         
	Khan said: This is an eyewash. My wing has completed the trimming work in the city proper and the chopped off branches and leaves have been kept in Tallah park.        
	According to a parks and gardens wing official, trees need to be trimmed in East Calcutta, Tollygunge, Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur.        
	Over 1.5 lakh trees have to trimmed in the two weeks before Puja. It is a Herculean task. Plus, we have to remove the branches and leaves with eight of our 10 trucks grounded following the high court order banning commercial vehicles over 15 years old, said deputy chief engineer Debasish Chakraborty, currently associated with the parks and gardens wing.         
	Ghosh Dastidar was not available for comment. A senior official in the conservancy department said: Except the past two years, the parks and gardens wing has undertaken the pre-Puja tree trim on it own. We extended support for the last two years on request. This cannot be a regular arrangement.

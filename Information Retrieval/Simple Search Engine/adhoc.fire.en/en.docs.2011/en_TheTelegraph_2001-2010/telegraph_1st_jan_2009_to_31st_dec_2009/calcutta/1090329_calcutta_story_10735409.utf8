The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | World play elsewhere
                                                                                                               World play elsewhere
										      Stage                              
	While several groups from the city and the districts celebrated World Theatre Day in the Rabindra Sadan complex, a group made the day memorable in its own way in Santipur.         
	Inaugurated by Sova Sen, the Calcutta programme with the support of the state Natya Akademi had theatre songs, a childrens play and excerpts of plays by Tagore, Biru Mukhopadhyay, Mohit Chattopadhyay, Usha Ganguli, adaptations of Augusto Boal, Brecht and others.         
	There was also mime by Iman Mime Centre and a puppet show by Suresh Dutta.         
	Some 500 groups participated in the programme, which started with a colourful procession from the Maidan Metro station to Rabindra Sadan, said Champak Baul of the Natya Akademi.        
	For Santipur Sanskritik, this was the eighth Natya Kojagari at the Library Hall of Santipur. Kojagari simply means staying awake for theatre which is what we do through this nightlong programme, said Kaushik Chattopadhyay, the director of the 23-year-old group.         
	With a modest budget of Rs 30,000, the group hosts folk dance and theatre performers as well as urban plays, and arranges food and refreshments for some 500 viewers. The programme runs from 5pm to 8am of the next day.         
	Among past participants are Kaushik Sen, Bivas Chakraborty and Chandan Sen. This year Sima Mukhopadhyay was present.         
	Local artists, writers and people from various fields look forward to this event and respond freely, said Chattopadhyay.        
	National drama school        
	National School of Drama, Calcutta chapter, will begin at the Minerva once the elections are over and paperwork is done, said Shamik Bandyopadhyay, the vice-chairman of the NSD.         
	On inspecting the Minerva we found it suitable to open a full-fledged drama school that would cater to the needs of West Bengal. The government has not given in writing what rights we would have over the space but we have been verbally assured that we can use the entire building for the three or four years needed for the Rawdon Square premises to be ready. We have also been promised a say in the Rawdon Square constructional plan, said Bandyopadhyay.         
	The medium of instruction would be Bengali and the first year would be devoted to defining the right course and syllabus for NSD Calcutta.         
	An advisory committee comprising theatre practitioners, academicians and scholars will be formed. In the first year we also hope to use the premises for workshops and seminars, said Bandyopadhyay.         
	Where that leaves the Minerva Natya Sanskriti Charcha Kendra is unknown.       SEBANTI SARKAR

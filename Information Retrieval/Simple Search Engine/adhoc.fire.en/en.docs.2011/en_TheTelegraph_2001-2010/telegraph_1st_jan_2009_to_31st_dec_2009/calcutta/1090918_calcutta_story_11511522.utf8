The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Catwalk, of amp; by the govt   Fashion show finale for handloom fair
                                                                                                               Catwalk, of amp; by the govt     Fashion show finale for handloom fair
          OUR BUREAU                                                  
	What does a government struggling to organise land for industry and votes for elections do? It organises a fashion show, instead.        
	On a day when the chief minister nearly lost his chair (at a press conference to announce new plots for Infosys and Wipro), two of his so-called young guns were busy booking a front-row seat for a ramp romp to promote the traditional khadi and handloom industry of the state.        
	At Writers Buildings on Thursday, state textiles minister Manabendra Mukherjee and former CPM MP and now West Bengal Khadi and Village Industries Commission chairman Mohd Salim unveiled the September 19 fashion show at Milan Mela.        
	It will be a first-of-its-kind show, crowed Mukherjee, before spelling out what there would be  six top female and four top male models from Mumbai and Calcutta, and Tollywood actress Locket Chatterjee as showstopper  and what there wouldnt be  Vasundhara Raje on the ramp (she had walked for the Rajasthan Khadi and Gramodyog Board in Jaipur) or a wardrobe malfunction.        
	The two-hour show, to be organised in collaboration with the West Bengal Khadi amp; Village Industries Board and supported by the likes of Tantuja and Manjusa, will mark the closing of Banglar Taanter Haat on Saturday, the fair that Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had visited straight from the airport after arriving from Siliguri on Saturday.        
	If models will be seen sashaying down the ramp in traditional and diversified khadi and handloom, Locket is set to strike a pose in a kantha sari with khadi weave. I received a call from Mohd Salim asking me to be the showstopper for a fashion event. Im not sure what Im supposed to wear, but itll have a khadi focus, she told Metro.        
	Prosenjit was flashed like a trump card by M/S Mukherjee and Salim on Thursday as the distinguished guest at the fashion event.        
	Yes, Manab Mukherjee called me and asked if I could drop by at the fashion show. I havent confirmed yet, but I will go if I am free, the Tollywood star told Metro.        
	No distinguished guest is likely to turn up if he goes through the invitation letter sent out by the West Bengal Khadi amp; Village Industries Board. Sample this (we reproduce this ad verbatim): The fashion show would contain cat walk and demonstration by different expert group of models, both male female...        
	The director duo of the cat walk, however, are not to be denied their two minutes of glam glory. Our products must reach a big and discerning clientele, stressed Mukherjee.        
	His event manager partner Salim got into the act with a not-so-veiled reference to the popular Kolkata Fashion Week held last week with the likes of Ritu Kumar and Manish Malhotra as designers and Giselle Monteiro and Neil Nitin Mukesh as showstoppers. Ours will be a different show, away from the plush corridors and banquet halls of hotels. It will be in a haat.        
	But why must the government get into the greenroom act of organising a fashion show? Mukherjee said: It is the need of the hour to diversify the use of these textiles.        
	And, maybe, to diversify the skill sets of CPM leaders.        
	Yes, minister?

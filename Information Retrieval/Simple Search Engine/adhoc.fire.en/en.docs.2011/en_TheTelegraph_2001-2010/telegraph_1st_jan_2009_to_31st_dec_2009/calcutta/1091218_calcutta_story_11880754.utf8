                      Strum softly for you tread on my soul...                    If youre looking for youth, youre looking for longevity, just take a dose of rock n roll. It keeps you going. Just like the caffeine in your coffee. Rock n roll is good for the soul, for the well being, for the psyche, for your everything. I love it. I cant even picture being without rock n roll...  Hank Ballard.   Indians writing in English have readers all over the world. Indian filmmakers making films in English language get international audiences. Indian artists receive global recognition. But when it comes to Indian musicians making music in English, frowns appear, subjective criticism is so vehement, it could almost be mistaken for poetry. Yet many of these hypercritics can be seen energetically wagging their heads to rock, folk, country, hip-hop, or whatever music which has originated in the Occident. Despite this strong bias, there are still musicians trying to do their original English music and one man has the courage of his convictions to take a deep plunge into not just the unknown, but to do the unheard of, and he is Bertie da Silva. His lyrics, deep and thoughtful, perfectly complement the painstaking arrangements of the music, and this time Bertie plays The Dark Hand with Willie Walters on bass, Sooman on guitar, Suraj Pradhan on drums and Anindya Paul on backing vocals.

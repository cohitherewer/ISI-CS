	A Metro guide to the nuances of Navami.               
	What is todays ritual?        
	The most important ritual on Navami is hom. The fire of the hom is said to represent the mouth of the god being worshipped and it is mandatory to make the offering at the centre of the flames. Hom is one of the rituals that makes Durga puja a mahapuja.        
	The almanac says Navami puja and hom have to be completed by 9.28am (Gupta Press) and 9.29am (Bisuddhasiddhanta). Dont forget to get a hom tika from the hom kund.              
	When is pushpanjali?        
	Pushpanjali will be held after completion of the puja. Navami is on till 2.03am on Monday (Gupta Press) and 2.06am (Bisuddhasiddhanta).              
	Where to go?         
	Take a tour of the traditional house pujas of Calcutta like Hatkholar Duttabari, Sovabazar Rajbari, Darjiparar Mitrabari, Chhatubabu-Latubabur puja, Lahabari and Potoldangar Basu Mullickbari in north Calcutta and Mullickbari and the Sabarna Roy Chowdhury pujas in the south.

	What to eat?         
	Go for a luchi-aloo dum-bonde brunch. Rustle up a late lunch of mangsho bhaat and take a nap. Then go pandal-hopping all night. Dashami is a dry day post-4pm, so stock up on your poison. Hic!

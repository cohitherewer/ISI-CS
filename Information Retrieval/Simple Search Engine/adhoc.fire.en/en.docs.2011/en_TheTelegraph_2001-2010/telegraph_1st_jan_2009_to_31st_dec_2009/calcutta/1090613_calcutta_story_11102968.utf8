          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 39-year-old teacher of a school in central Calcutta, who was allegedly kidnapped by her 50-year-old brother-in-law on Monday, was rescued by police from a Bhubaneswar hotel late on Thursday.        
	The brother-in-law was arrested in the raid and remanded in police custody till June 26.        
	The woman, a resident of Colootola Street in central Calcutta, told cops that her brother-in-law had picked her up in a car on the pretext of dropping her home.        
	I was returning from a sari shop near my home around noon when a Tata Sumo with my brother-in-law inside intercepted my path. He said he was going to our home. I grew suspicious when I saw the driver was heading towards Howrah, the police quoted the teacher as saying.        
	According to the statement, she tried to raise an alarm but got scared after her relative, a trader, threatened to kill her. I was at a loss and didnt know what to do. Fearing for my life I didnt resist, she stated.        
	The two reached Bhubaneswar late on Monday and put up in a hotel. When the man went to the toilet, the teacher sent an SMS to her husband stating that she had been kidnapped and brought to Bhubaneswar. After receiving the message, the husband lodged a complaint with Bowbazar police station.         
	By tracking the traders cellphone, we identified the hotel on June 10 night, said Buddhadeb Mukherjee, the officer-in-charge of Bowbazar police station. The team raided the hotel, arrested the trader and rescued the teacher on Thursday.         
	The school declined comment saying it was a personal matter.

	 Apropos the article Mystery shutterbug unmasked (October 18), the old URL for the link to the website of old Calcutta photographs was used. Here is the updated link. http://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/sasia/calcutta1947/. The name of the unknown GI was misspelt: it is Clyde not Claude. You might also be interested in another collection that I put of a local woman, Mary Binney Wheeler, who took a number of trips to India in the 1970s and 1980s and I have put up her collection of slides as well.

	 Apropos the article 50 reasons not to marry a Bengali man, October 4, I would like to add reason No. 51: Every Bengali chhele worth his gonf-panjabi-cigarette-Robindro Joyonti thinks he has a birthright to intellectualism. Ditto for his ghonishthho (close) family comprising Rinadi, Rituda, Saolidi, and others. Add to it Anjandas music, Suvadas Kaak series and Moheens original horses and the burden of shongshkriti (culture) might become too cumbersome for anyone married to the aforementioned Bangali jubok.

	 Bigotry against a race is termed racism and bigotry against women is sexism. Now, Metro exposes bigotry against Bengali men and calls it humour. The article is symptomatic of the vilification and devaluation of men that has resulted from female empowerment in urban India. It is unfortunate that The Telegraph considers it acceptable to publish such a crude and malicious mockery of Bengali men, and expects the reader to be amused. It is unlikely that a similar compilation concerning Bengali women would be treated with such tolerance.

										      Flashback                                Tripta Haldar and (above) Champa Haldar. Pictures by Nilangshu Haldar				                           
	Memories can halt the march of time. Human beings, in reality wrinkled with age, and buildings ruined beyond repair, remain fresh, unblemished and untouched by age in the redoubts of memories.         
	Events beyond recall are brought back to life in memories. Pickled and congealed, the parallel reality of memories can rejuvenate the past in such vivid colours that even when they play tricks we like to think they are absolute truths. Shared memories can recall the past with even more conviction.        
	Tripta Haldar and her daughter-in-law, Champa Haldar, both recall their youthful days in Pathuriaghats Prasad and at 1 Darpanarayan Tagore Street, that are still the seats of branches of the Tagore family  Tripta as the friend of the Tagore family, and Champa as their daughter.         
	Triptas husband, Niroj, was friend and cousin of Prabirendra Mohan Tagore of Prasad. His wife, Surity, was her best friend. Champas father, Purnendra Nath Tagore, had three daughters and a son.        
	Tripta is 88 now, but her memory is still sharp and fresh. She lives in her flat in Garia, miles away from Beniapukur where their house was once located. She got married at the age of 12, four years after Suritys wedding. Champa is 72. She lives in Ballygunge.        
	The Disneyesque Tagore Castle was used as a car park. Prasad opposite it with 200 rooms was where the Tagore family lived. Prabirendra and his father, Pradyot Kumar Tagore, lived on the first floor, their quarters separated by the chandeliered dance hall, which turned into a banquet hall on special occasions.         
	The dance hall had chandeliers standing on pedestals. It had wainscoting that was removed later.        
	The guards changed at Prasad from time to time. In the daytime, it was a Sikh with a sword. After midnight, a small man built like a pugilist, his body glistening with oil, and wearing a length of red cloth and with a red tika on his forehead would take over. He carried a khanda and was a fearsome figure.         
	Prabirendra was a fun-loving man. He and my husband were constantly up to some trick or the other. Once when it was quite late and we were about to leave, suddenly he summoned this guard: Jallad ko bulao. I quaked at the sight of this man. We could not leave        
	The Tagore family had a fleet of cars. Maharaja Pradyot Kumar Tagore had his Rolls Royce. It had a telephone for the Maharaja to give instructions to his chauffeur.         
	The Maharaja was a man of taste. He did not like his washerman to launder anybody elses clothes. A special car carried his clothes to Emerald Bower, their summer house, on Barrackpore Trunk Road, where the washerman lived.        
	Beside the Chrysler and the Vauxhall was a station wagon that had bunches of grapes made of glass hanging from the ceiling. They tinkled in the breeze.         
	Tripta recalls outings with Surity, who used to drive from Pathuriaghat all the way to Jadubabur bazar in Bhawanipore. The two men sat behind us and didi (that is what she called Surity) would shout: Hato, hato, to shoo away people who fell in her path. We went there to buy paan from a man named Badal Ram.

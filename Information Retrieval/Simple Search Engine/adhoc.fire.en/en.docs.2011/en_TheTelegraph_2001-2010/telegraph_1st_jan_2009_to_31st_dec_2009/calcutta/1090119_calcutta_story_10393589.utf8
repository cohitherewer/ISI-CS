The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Makeover for music school
                                                                                                               Makeover for music school

	London-based cellist Anup Kumar Biswas is back home in Calcutta to turn the music school he founded in 1994 into a conservatory and academic centre spread over 16 bigha.        
	The residential school, in the middle of sprawling paddy fields in the interiors of Thakurpukur, where 63 destitute children study and learn both Western and Indian classical music, will house at least 200 destitute children after the makeover.        
	The new school will have KG to Class XII. We will seek affiliation with the Delhi-based ICSE board, said Biswas, who studied at Oxford Mission in Barisha before leaving the country at 17 on a scholarship from the Royal Academy of Music, London.        
	The 52-year-old performs in concerts across the UK to raise money for Mathieson Music Trust, which funds the school. Proceeds from sponsored marathons and contributions from the 80 supporters in the UK also help in the running of the school.         
	Students, who can now study up to Class VIII and Grade 8 of the Associated Board of Royal School of Music, London, find jobs in the army or navy bands or as studio musicians in Bollywood.        
	Seven bighas of an adjoining plot has recently been acquired for the expansion. Reverend Father William Taylor from St Johns Church in Notting Hill, London, recently laid the foundation stone for a church-cum-concert hall.        
	The dormitories and classrooms will be razed to make space for a high school and a junior school. Construction will start in end-February. First on the cards is a double-storey girls hostel that can accommodate 102 students. Two L-shaped buildings will form a quadrangle with the courtyard serving as playground.        
	The building for juniors will have beds and a large study hall with individual desks for each student while the four dormitories for older students will have workstations attached to their beds. The two-storey music school will be shaped like a honeycomb with individual practice and performance cells.        
	The dormitories should be functional by 2010, said Dominic Horton, a member of the Mathieson Music Trust board. Since the area gets flooded, the buildings will come up on stilts. We want lots of space, air and light where children can live freely and simply. I want to turn the school into a global centre for education and culture, said Biswas.        
	The premises should be simple, functional and beautiful. The children come from a poor background. We dont want to offer the kind of luxury that would be difficult for them to sustain when they leave the school, added Horton.        
	A guest house will be built over a water body for visitors from music schools in the UK and gap-year students from abroad invited to teach.

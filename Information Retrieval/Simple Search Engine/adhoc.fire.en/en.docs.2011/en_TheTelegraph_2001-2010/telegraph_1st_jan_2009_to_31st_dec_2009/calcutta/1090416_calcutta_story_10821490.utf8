                      Responding to violence                    Combining diverse elements including painting, sculpture, collage and photography, Hema Upadhyay reflects upon issues of gender, class and dislocation in her art. Her paintings are generally characterised by the presence of small, collaged, photographic self-portraits. Miniaturising images of herself in various positions, she inserts them into her allegorical landscapes, allowing them to interact with the decorative and fictional environments that she creates. Another remarkable feature of her works is her patterned surfaces that have references to Indian spiritual iconography and traditional textile design. Yours Sincerely, the ongoing show of her paintings and sculpture, focuses on her current concern with the violence, destruction and turbulence afflicting the country. The symbols in Upadhyays work clearly point to the rising sectarian intolerance to be found everywhere and to the perpetrators and innocent victims.                  Event: An exhibition of paintings and sculpture by Hema Upadhyay When: Till April 19; 11 am - 7 pm Where: Bose Pacia, Stephen Court, 18 Park Street

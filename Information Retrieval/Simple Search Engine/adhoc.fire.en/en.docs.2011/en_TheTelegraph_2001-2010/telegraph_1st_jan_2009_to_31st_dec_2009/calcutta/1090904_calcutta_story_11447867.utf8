The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Two more in monkey theft racket
                                                                                                               Two more in monkey theft racket
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Sleuths have learnt about the involvement of two more persons in the theft of eight Common Marmosets from Alipore zoo but refused to divulge their identities.        
	The theft probe has so far netted two  city youth Sujoy Das and Raj Saikia, a resident of Durg in Chhattisgarh.        
	The unnamed suspects, officers probing the case said, had worked closely with Saikia and even possibly visited the city twice with him before the August 9 theft.        
	We will question Saikia to know more about the duo. They might have been involved with Saikia in the illegal trade in exotic animals, said an officer of the detective department.        
	The cops have decided to pit Saikia against Das to ferret out more information about the racket. They may also be taken to the zoo in an attempt to reconstruct the events leading to the theft.        
	We have to find out how they came to know that the eight rare monkeys were kept in an enclosure behind the zoo library on the western side of the compound and not in their original shelter on the southern side, said an officer.        
	Insiders said Saikia had washed his hand of the theft, saying it was Das who had handed over the animals to him. Das, on the other hand, denied being involved in the crime.        
	We dont think this is true. What we have learnt is that Saikia was in or around the zoo while the marmosets were being taken out of the enclosure. Its evident that Das was in touch with Saikia as the Durg residents cellphone was stored in his cellphone, an investigating officer said.        
	The zoo authorities held a meeting on Thursday and finalised the plan to install closed-circuit TV cameras on the premises in an attempt to boost security. The private security guards have been provided with bicycles for effective patrolling and all entries, by employees or visitors, are being recorded.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Garages rule the road
                                                                                                               Garages rule the road

	Vanishing pavements are the bane of the people living on Justice Dwarakanath Road in south Calcutta. Residents of the locality, fondly remember the time when there were wide pavements on the road. Today, all the pavements in the locality, starting from Sambhunath Pandit Hospital to Puddapukur Road via Jagubabur Bazar, have disappeared as automobile workshops flourish in the area, encroaching on the sidewalks and parts of the carriageway.        
	A cacophony of horns, revving of engines, pounding of metal sheets and sounds of welding greet visitors. This has become a part of the daily lives of residents here. Flouting all pollution norms and without any clearance from the Pollution Control Board (PCB), the workshops continue to thrive and multiply in a predominantly residential zone. When confronted, garage mechanics cite instances of other lawlessness in the city that somehow gives them the right to break law too.         
	Garage voice        
	It is true we have no clearance from the PCB but are we the only law breakers in Calcutta? When despite court orders, two-stroke autos still ply on the road, the number of illegal construction is growing daily and pavements are being encroached upon by hawkers, how do you expect us to operate within rules? Dont we have to make a living too? says local garage owner Debasish Kaur.         
	The area, also known as Oriya Para, got its name when people from Orissa came and settled here and first started repairing vehicles on the pavements. However, today, they are a minority here as Gujaratis, Punjabis and Marwaris have made this place their home.         
	Automobile workshops mushroomed here along with Mullick Bazar and motorists and taxi owners of south Calcutta still prefer Oriya Para to Mullick Bazar when it comes to repairing their vehicles.                 
	Two-way traffic is allowed on Justice Dwarakanath Road. During peak hours, the situation turns ugly as mechanics repair cars right on the carriageway regardless of the heavy flow of vehicles. In the lanes and bylanes too, cars are stationed right in the middle of the road waiting to be repaired. At times, 10-wheel trucks, trailers and payloaders remain parked here for two weeks or more.         
	We submitted a memorandum to the local police station, wrote to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and the state government but all our efforts were in vain, said K. Banerjee, a businessman living on Justice Dwarakanath Road. Here is a garage right in front of my house and whenever I have to go out I need to request them for passage, he added.        
	Civicspeak         
	Local councillor Asha Banerjee said: Despite a lot of complaints, the civic body has not taken any action against the workshops. However, she avoided responsibility saying that it was the duty of the police to drive out encroachers.         
	Mayoral council member and CPM MLA Chandana Ghosh Dastidar, who is in charge of conservancy, held the local residents responsible for the encroachment. I believe illegal workshops have mushroomed with the tacit support of local residents. The CMC had constructed the pavements for the people and it is the responsibility of the people to prevent any encroachment, she said.        
	PCBspeak         
	According to the PCB, automobile garages in residential areas are always illegal and whenever the PCB receives complaints, a drive is undertaken. Recently, the PCB closed 11 garages in different residential pockets.        
	But we havent received any complaint from Justice Dwarakanath Road, said the chief law officer of the PCB, Biswajit Mukherjee.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The central intelligence bureau has alerted the city police to the possibility of Pakistani terrorists heading for Kashmir via Calcutta after sneaking in through the Bangladesh border.         
	We were told that terrorists will use Calcutta to reach Jammu and Kashmir, said an officer of the city polices Special Task Force (STF), which is in charge of keeping a watch on terrorist activities.        
	The alert followed a recent warning by the US-based Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) that some people had entered the country to carry out terrorist activities. Subsequent raids led to the arrest of two persons in Pune.         
	Asked why terrorists would try to reach Jammu and Kashmir through Calcutta instead of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), an intelligence bureau official said: It is difficult to enter the country through PoK in winter because of heavy snowfall. So they try the Karachi-Dhaka-Calcutta route to reach their destination.        
	STF officers have activated their sources across the city and along the Indo-Bangla border to nab those who have entered the country illegally.        
	We are keeping a close eye on pockets in Jorasanko, New Market, Tiljala and Topsia. Hotels and guest houses are under our scanner, said an officer.        
	According to the police, on several occasions, terrorists had spent time in the city before carrying out blasts elsewhere. We are trying to track down those who have been selected to provide refuge to terrorists. We have come to know of a place in Kalyani where fake passports are handed over to Pakistanis, said another officer.        
	The Border Security Force has also been asked to step up vigil along Bangladesh.

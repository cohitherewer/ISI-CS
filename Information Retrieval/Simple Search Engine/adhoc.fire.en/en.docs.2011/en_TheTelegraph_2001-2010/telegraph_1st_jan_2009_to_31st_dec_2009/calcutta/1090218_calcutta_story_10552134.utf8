	The post-mortem on Sanchita Sarkars body suggested that the 24-year-old aspiring model hanged herself, police said on Tuesday.         
	Sanchitas friends said she had gone into depressed after finding out that the businessman she had moved in with three months ago was married, said investigators.        
	The friends also said she had bagged a few modelling contracts but was struggling to reach the top bracket. She used to suffer from work-related stress, which could have led to her nervous disorder, said an officer of Lake police.        
	She was pressuring her partner to divorce his wife and might have been shattered when he refused, added the officer.         
	Sanchita was found hanging from the ceiling fan of her rented house off Jodhpur Park on Monday evening. Her parents, residents of Siliguri, were informed of her death at night.

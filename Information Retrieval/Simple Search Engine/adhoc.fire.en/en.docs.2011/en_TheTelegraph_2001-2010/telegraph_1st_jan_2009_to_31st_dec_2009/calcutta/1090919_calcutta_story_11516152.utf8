	Sugar and pulses worth over Rs 250 crore are rotting inside the godown of Calcutta Port Trust for the past 10 weeks even as the prices of these products skyrocket in the marketplace because of a demand-supply mismatch.        
	The port trust has blamed it on the inordinate delay by the Central Food Laboratory (CFL), a wing of the Union health ministry, to give the mandatory certificate that the consignment is fit for consumption and so can be picked up from the godown.        
	One lakh tonnes of pulses imported from Myanmar, Canada, Russia and Ukraine and 2,000 tonnes of sugar imported from Myanmar, Brazil and Thailand are waiting to be picked up from sheds 2, 13 and 14 of Netaji Subhas Dock and sheds 5, 7, and 25 to 28 at Kidderpore Dock from the last week of June.        
	CFL officials admitted on Friday that an agitation by employees sparked by the governments plan to turn the unit into an autonomous body has slowed things down.        
	A member of the Joint Platform of Action of central employees in Calcutta said: An agitation since June-end has affected work.        
	Had the CFL given the certificate on time, the huge consignment could have reached the market within a few days and helped bring down the prices of pulses and sugar, said a port trust official.                    One of the sheds in which the consignment lies idle. (Anindya Shankar Ray)        
	There has been a huge backlog as CFL officials have not given the clearance needed for the importers to pick up the goods, Anindya Majumdar, the chairman of Calcutta Port Trust, told Metro.        
	The consignment of pulses and sugar, he added, were imported by at least seven private parties and some government agencies such as NEFD and NMTC.        
	Anurag Tulsan, the co-ordinator of Pulses Importers Association, said: Our consignment of pulses and sugar worth about Rs 250 crore could have brought price relief to consumers in this festive time. We have written to the Union food and consumer affairs ministry in Delhi and they have promised to look into the matter by next Tuesday.        
	Anand Kothari of Prime Impex, added: My consignment of pulses and rice worth several crores has been been lying idle there. We are helpless and do not know when we will be able to pick them up.        
	According to central norms, consignments of food items are first kept inside the port trust godowns  for which the importers are required to pay a charge  after being unloaded from ships.        
	CFL officials then have to collect samples of the food items and certify them fit for human consumption. It is only then that the consignment is handed over to importers.        
	There has been seepage of water in some of the godowns and that has damaged the pulses. Any food item stored for a long period will result in some wastage and degradation during the monsoon. If not cleared immediately, the huge consignment can rot, warned a customs official.        
	In an internal report prepared by Calcutta Port Trust, a copy of which is with Metro, the authorities have highlighted the CFLs inordinate delay in issuing certificates for all consignments landing here.        
	The issuance of certificate takes considerably longer (on an average 10 to 15 days) than in other ports where it takes only two to three days at the most. The matter has been taken up with the concerned ministry, said the report.        
	A CFL official at his Park Street address refused to be drawn into the port trust versus food lab face-off, but admitted that the present agitation was taking a toll. We will meet Dinesh Trivedi soon.        
	The minister of state for health said he would look into the matter.

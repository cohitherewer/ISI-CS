The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Four strokes to ferry people in peace
                                                                                                               Four strokes to ferry people in peace

	Violent protests by autorickshaw unions backed by political parties have slowed the pace of the implementation of the high court ban on two-stroke three-wheelers. When they are not burning buses, autorickshaw drivers are painting, scratching and smudging the two-stroke signs on their vehicles to stop police from seizing them. In this melee, a handful of auto drivers is ferrying passengers without fear. They are the ones who have obeyed the high court order and switched to four-stroke autorickshaws. Metro profiles three auto drivers who are setting an example for their colleagues              
	Who: Sheikh Rahmat Ali        
	Age: 28 years        
	Where can you see him: On the Kimber Street-Topsia route. He has been driving autos on the stretch since March last year. He switched to a four-stroke LPG auto within a month of the high court ban in July.        
	Why did he opt for four-stroke LPG: I was aware of the impending ban on two-stroke autorickshaws. I had a feeling that all of us would have to abide by the high court ruling, says Rahmat, who drives the only four-stroke three-wheeler on the route.        
	He had to shell out Rs 40,000 more than the price of a a two-stroke auto but is reaping the benefits now. I drive my auto without fear. Those who used to laugh at me for spending Rs 40,000 extra now appreciate my foresight.        
	Though Rahmat is a member of an auto union, he did not take part in the burning of buses in the area on Saturday. He feels unavailability of LPG and hassles in maintaining vehicles running on gas are important factors behind auto drivers not switching to clean fuel.         
	Rahmat has to go to a petrol pump near Ruby Hospital for a refill and to Southern Avenue to get his auto serviced.        
	His take on the controversy: The court is supreme and we must abide by its directive. Switching over to four-stroke will benefit us as well as the common people.              
	Who: Tapas Kundu        
	Age: 21 years        
	Where can you see him: On the Ultadanga-Baguiati route. He has been driving a four-stroke LPG auto since September.        
	Why did he opt for four-stroke LPG: My father drives a nine-year-old two-stroke autorickshaw on the Lake Town-Belgachhia Metro station route. Six months ago, when I was planning to purchase an auto, he insisted that I opt for a four-stroke one. Thanks to him I am earning my livelihood without fear, said Tapas.         
	His three-wheeler does not have a music system or fancy lights. I am using the money to pay the higher monthly instalment. After I have paid off the amount I will have no headaches for the next 15 years.         
	His take on the controversy: Violence is not the solution. It is not too late to switch.               
	Who: Ashim Das        
	Age: 45 years        
	Where can you see him: On the Ultadanga-Karunamoyee route. He switched to a four-stroke autorickshaw two years ago.         
	Why did he opt for four-stroke: When I used to drive the two-stroke auto, I would cough badly and feel very lethargic. I decided to buy a four-stroke auto for the sake of my health and that of others, said Das.        
	He claimed that he has persuaded other drivers on his route to convert.        
	His take on the controversy: Nobody is above the law. If we are arrogant, we will end up antagonising the common people.

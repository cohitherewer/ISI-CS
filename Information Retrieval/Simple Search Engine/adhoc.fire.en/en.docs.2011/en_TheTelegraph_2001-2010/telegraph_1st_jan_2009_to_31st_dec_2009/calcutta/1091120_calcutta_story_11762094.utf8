                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Arrests reveal motive for woman murder
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Manju Ghoshal, found murdered in her Kalighat flat on November 6, had to pay with her life for refusing money to a youth who was in need of cash for his mothers treatment.        
	Police identified the killer as Sushil Sardar, 22, whose mother-in-law Usha Mondol was Ghoshals domestic help. Sushils alleged partner in crime was Swapan Sardar, a relative. The duo were picked up from their Baruipur houses on Thursday.        
	Ghoshal, a retired employee of the the post and telegraph department, had been living alone in her Nepal Bhattacharya Street flat since her husbands death 10 years ago.         
	Neighbour Dola Roy found Ghoshals body in a blood-soaked gown when she walked in through the open door of the flat minutes after the murder.        
	Sleuths said Sushil, a mason, often visited Ghoshals flat and gifted her various items, such as coconuts, from his ancestral village.        
	Sushil needed money for his mothers treatment. The woman, who needs surgery, was admitted to hospital after being beaten up by her husband a few days ago. Sushil asked Ghoshal for Rs 5,000 but the woman said she was not in a position to give him money, city detective chief Damayanti Sen said.        
	A desperate Sushil approached a few others but none helped him.        
	He and Swapan then hatched a plot to kill Ghoshal. The duo went to the Kalighat flat around 9.30am. Ghoshal offered both tea, said an officer of the detective department.        
	Later, Swapan tied up Ghoshals hands and legs and Sushil stabbed her with a knife. They took away the gold bangles she was wearing and Rs 2,200 from a drawer.        
	The two were looking around for more money and valuables when a representative of a newspaper company rang the doorbell. The representative left as none opened the door but while turning away he caught a glimpse of the duo through the grille, said an officer.        
	The Sardars fled soon after.

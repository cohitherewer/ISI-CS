  - Glitches force Team Nandan to eye plexes          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Wanted: suitable screens for the 16th Calcutta Film Festival. If the political ground seems to be slipping from beneath the chief ministers feet, the venues for his pet cultural project are definitely shrinking.        
	Tech trouble affecting the audio-visual quality of films at the 15th edition of the festival that ended on Tuesday has forced Team Bhattacharjee to junk five of the eight venues and eye multiplexes and standalone movie halls for next year.        
	The projectors used at non-film theatres of Rabindra Sadan, Girish Mancha, Sisir Mancha, Madhusudan Mancha and Purbashree are improvised ones hired for seven days.        
	Since they arent regularly in use the films often get stuck during screenings. Also, these projectors cannot support the new Dolby Digital prints made post-2007, which are technologically more advanced, said festival director Nilanjan Chatterjee. Well look at multiplexes and standalone halls, but well have to see if they are willing to rent out their premises for the seven days of the festival.        
	At first look, Arijit Dutta of Priya Entertainment seemed reluctant. Apart from a few individuals no one is interested in these genres. Last year, I took off Fashion, running houseful in Priya and Star, to screen festival films that saw 10 per cent occupancy.        
	With plexes looking at product innovations, festival films may yet enter the mall-multiplex addresses. But only if it means business, agree rivals INOX and Fame Cinemas.         
	Virendra Marya of INOX voted for pragmatism over political correctness: If we are approached, we will definitely try and screen festival films, but... we cannot sacrifice our scheduled commercial releases that have a lot more takers in order to accommodate festival films.        
	Rishi Negi of Fame Cinemas added: Apart from the pure viewing experience, we will have to consider whether screening these films is financially viable.

                      Life is beautiful                    Figurative, narrative, mixed media works with three-dimensional figures in the foreground make up Small Things, the ongoing solo exhibition of paintings by Nisreen Moochhala. The subject matter of the show is daily life in a modern metropolis; its streets and buildings, parks and theatres, trains with crowded compartments, people thronging to work, or just resting, gazing, waiting, performing. Together, they document the various aspects of city life. Though the artist does not refrain from commenting on life in general in her works, her tone is never unkind. Her take on life is patient and gentle, and there is no attempt at condemnation or satire. Moochhala does not step back from her works to criticise her subjects. Her intention is not to challenge, unsettle or disturb. Rather, her paintings reflect her wish to participate in all the bustling human life and activity she finds around her. In fact, one can almost perceive the sheer delight felt by the artist, a joy  eloquently evoked in her playful, childlike style  in the small things of everyday life. Hosted by The Seagull Foundation for the Arts.                  Event: An exhibition of paintings by Nisreen Moochhala When: Till January 22; 2 pm - 8 pm Where: Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre, 36C S.P. Mukherjee Road

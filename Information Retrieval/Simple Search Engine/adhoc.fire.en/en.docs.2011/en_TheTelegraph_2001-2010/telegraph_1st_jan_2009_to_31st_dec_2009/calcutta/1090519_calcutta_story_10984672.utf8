The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | All eyes on sensex surge
                                                                                                               All eyes on sensex surge
  - Investors battered and bruised inch back towards the market          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Uma Bagri had stayed off stocks for the past eight months after her investments shrank to one fourth of the original volume. The 34-year-old homemaker, who used to trade from home, had made a determined exit from the equities market as wild fluctuations at the bourses eroded her wealth.        
	She almost broke her eight-month-old resolve on Monday as the sensex rode the Congress wave and surged past the 14,000 mark as soon as the markets opened. I was tempted to trade but even before I could take a call, the markets were shut, said Bagri, initially upset at missing out on the golden opportunity.        
	But by the end of the day she had fallen back on the basics of smart investing and decided not to jump the gun.        
	For me it is a classic case of once bitten, twice shy. After suffering such huge losses, I am no longer in a hurry to return to the market. But I must admit that todays developments made me interested in stocks once again, she added.         
	Bagri was speaking on behalf of scores of beaten and bruised retail investors, who had bid goodbye to the bourses in the past few months after a slew of factors  ranging from the global downturn to uncertainty in the domestic markets  battered the sensex.        
	Though trading was suspended through the day, the excitement amongst the investors and the brokers was palpable at brokerage houses. Traders crowded in front of television screens while tele-callers were busy answering queries over phone.        
	It is like a smart shower after an oppressive bout of heat. We have been waiting for this day for long, said an excited 76-year-old trader, Sanket Yadav, while leaving a Dalhousie brokerage firm.         
	At Lyons range, the meteoric rise of the sensex got investors all excited.        
	The decisive mandate in favour of the UPA is great news for the markets as the foreign institutional investors will have more confidence, said 28-year-old Manish Pugalia, barely taking his eyes off the television set in one corner of his jewellery showroom in Burrabazar.        
	Though most agreed that a stable government at the Centre would boost the market sentiment, its impact on the fortunes of small investors remained a hotly debated issue. What is the guarantee that the market will sustain the surge? questioned Vikas Somani, a sari trader and an active investor in the markets.         
	The initial euphoria may be short-lived. It is better to wait and watch, he added, echoing the sentiments of scores of investors in the city.

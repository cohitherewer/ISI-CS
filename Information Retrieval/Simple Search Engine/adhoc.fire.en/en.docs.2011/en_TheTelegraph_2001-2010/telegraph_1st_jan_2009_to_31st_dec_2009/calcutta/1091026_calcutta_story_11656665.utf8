The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mamata bats for Behala, runs out Howrah

	Behalas gain is set to add to Howrahs mounting losses.        
	Mamata Banerjees gift to her constituency may result in the scrapping of a project that one of her predecessors as railway minister had planned for Howrah.        
	Ministry sources said Satyajit Ray Railway Indoor Stadium in Behalas Gholsapur, part of Mamatas South Calcutta constituency, might sound the death knell of a proposed sports complex in Howrah that Nitish Kumar had approved in 1997-98.         
	The railways will spend Rs 57 crore on the indoor stadium, the foundation stone of which was laid by Mamata on October 15 at a star-studded programme attended by local boy Sourav Ganguly, among others.        
	The stadium will be part of the sports complex that Mamata had gifted to Behala during her first tenure as railway minister in 2000-01.        
	Now that so much money is being spent on one stadium in the city, the Howrah project is destined to die a natural death, a senior ministry official said.        
	And whats the status of the Howrah project conceived more than a decade ago, even before Mamatas first gift to her electorate.        
	Not a single paisa has been spent on building the stadium, the ministry official said. The initial project cost was Rs 7.5 crore, which was later increased to around Rs 10 crore. Even if the ministry wanted to, it could not have built the stadium with the pittance.        
	The stadium  it was mentioned as one of the projects of the railways even in Mamatas budget speech in 2009  was to come up near the railway station, in the Lok Sabha constituency of Mamatas party colleague Ambika Bandopadhyay.        
	We were expecting that the project would be fast-tracked after Mamata assumed charge of the railway ministry. But she does not seem to be interested in it, said another official of the ministry.        
	An Eastern Railway official sought to justify the shift in attention from Howrah to Behala, saying: The Gholsapur complex has a stadium, swimming pool and gymnasium. Since all facilities are available, the ministry thought it wise to build the indoor stadium there.        
	The Behala spot, however, suffers from locational disadvantages. The stadium will seat 15,000-20,000 people. Big events cannot be held there as that will lead to traffic problems, said an official. A police officer of South 24-Parganas agreed: Since there are no wide roads, such events will cause huge traffic snarls.

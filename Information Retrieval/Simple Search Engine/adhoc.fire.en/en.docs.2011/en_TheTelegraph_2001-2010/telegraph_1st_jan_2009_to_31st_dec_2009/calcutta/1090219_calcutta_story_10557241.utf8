          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Eight persons were arrested with 6kg of heroin in two raids by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and the detective department of the city police on Wednesday. The haul is worth Rs 6 crore in the international market, sleuths said.         
	NCB officials said they had information about the contraband being transported to Calcutta from Nasik. We laid a trap at the Chichra checkpost on the West Midnapore-Orissa border and seized two trucks, said an NCB official. We arrested the drivers and two helpers.        
	The sleuths found 5kg of heroin hidden in boxes in the drivers cabins.        
	NCB officials also arrested another person in Bongaon, who was supposed to receive the consignment. The heroin was headed for Bangladesh, the sleuths said.

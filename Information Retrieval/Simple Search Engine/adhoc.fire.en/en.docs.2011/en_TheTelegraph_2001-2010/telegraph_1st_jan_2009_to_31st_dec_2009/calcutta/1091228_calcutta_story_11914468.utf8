          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Hundreds of JetLite passengers were stranded at Calcutta airport on Sunday because of bad weather and a snag in the airlines computerised railway reservation system.        
	The snag, which stalled the system around 2pm, forced the delay of three flights to Mumbai and one each to Bangalore, Delhi and Agartala for one-and-a-half hours on an average.        
	Airline sources said the snag developed while the check-in counters were being shifted. The seats were being allocated manually, leading to the series of delay, said the source. The snag was repaired in the evening.        
	Bad weather at Guwahati resulted in 181 passengers of a JetLite flight bound for the Assam capital being stranded in the city airport for more than 12 hours. The flight, scheduled to take off at 6.20am, left at 7.40am after news came that the weather at Guwahati had improved.        
	But the flight could not land at Guwahati as the weather worsened again and returned to Calcutta around 10.30am.        
	A special aircraft flew with the stranded passengers around 7pm. A Mumbai flight had to be cancelled to bring the passengers stranded at Guwahati. The Mumbai-bound fliers were accommodated on other flights.

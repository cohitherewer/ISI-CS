The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hurrah amp; horror
                                                                                                               Hurrah amp; horror
                                            From top: Mamata Banerjee, Manmohan Singh, Tata Nano and a BSF jawan                           
	Metro tuned in to the buzz around political camps on city streets this weekend to come up with              
	TRINAMULS HEROES        
	 Mamata Banerjee: This is her victory, said every party worker and winning candidate Metro spoke to. This is the triumph of one womans dogged, often desperate, fight against the seemingly invincible might of the Left Front, said one Trinamul leader.        
	 Manmohan Singh: Mamatas pre-poll alliance with the Congress was one smart move. The vote for Lok Sabha 2009 was a vote for a stable Congress-led government with Manmohan Singh as the Prime Minister.         
	Our dream is to see Manmohan Singh as Prime Minister and Didi as chief minister, beamed a party worker caked in green abir.         
	 Central forces: BSF zindabad! was a surprise slogan at Trinamul victory rallies, as the men in uniform emerged as the unlikely heroes of Election 2009. Only central forces were allowed to man the doors to the booths, denying the vanquished the usual excuses of rigging and booth capturing.        
	A presiding officer from Calcutta South said how he was heckled by CPM cadres for not allowing those without valid papers to vote on May 13. But before things spun out of control, the sector officer and CRPF men entered the booth and the troublemakers retreated.        
	At the Netaji Indoor Stadium counting centre on Saturday, Trinamul supporters were seen straining against the bamboo barricade  trying to garland BSF jawans!         
	 Debashis Sen: Chief electoral officer (CEO) Debashis Sen and his team was the other Trinamul hero for ensuring free and fair polls. The strong arm of the Election Commission that enabled fair elections in Bengal for the first time, said a Trinamul supporter.         
	And yes, Debashis Sen zindabad was a slogan.              
	CPMS VILLAINS        
	 Mamata: Period.        
	 Nano: If the Trinamul went to town with huge cut-outs of Mamata, the CPM erected Nano billboards. Slogans like Trinamul-o Nano chay, kintu Banglay noi, Gujarat-e tickled the Calcuttans funny bone, but did little more. The CPM tried to milk the Tata pullout for votes, while the Trinamul promised paribartan. It turned out to be a no-contest.        
	 Arrogant image: The growing perception was that the CPM leaders and foot soldiers alike had become too arrogant and had to be taught a lesson. That came in the form of one tight slap on May 16.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Winter is back with   licence   to chill
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Winter is back with   licence   to chill
          A STAFF REPORTER                                          
	Winter made a comeback of sorts on Tuesday with the minimum temperature returning to normal after a week and the weatherman eyeing a Celsius drop over the next seven days.        
	Tuesdays minimum temperature of 15.2 degrees Celsius was the first normal reading since November 30, the Alipore Met office said.        
	The mercury had climbed from the one-degree-below-normal mark of 15.4 degrees Celsius on November 29 to three degrees above normal at 17.7 degrees Celsius last Thursday. Temperatures started tapering down from the weekend.        
	Minimum temperatures last week were quite high for this time of the year. But such trends usually dont hold. Calcutta is already cooler and the mercury is likely to dip further over the next week, said an official of the India Meteorological Department in Delhi.        
	The weatherman had blamed a low-pressure trough over the Bay of Bengal and the reduced influence of northwesterlies for the relatively warm first week of December despite an early onset of winter, starting November 22.        
	Although a fresh low-pressure area has formed over the southwest Bay under the influence of an upper-air cyclonic circulation, its influence over south Bengal isnt likely to last more than a day.        
	The low-pressure area would start moving further away from Calcutta, from Wednesday, which could help lower temperatures, said the chief meteorologist of a private Met agency.        
	The extra moisture in the air has been causing misty mornings and humidity during the day. While the nip in the air was back on Tuesday, the maximum day temperature was two degrees above normal at 29.1 degrees Celsius. The discomfort index of 59 degrees Celsius was four notches above normal.        
	According to a senior scientist from the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting in Noida, a western disturbance set to affect the western Himalayan region from Wednesday and move eastward over the week would contribute significantly to bringing the Celsius down by a couple of degrees.        
	The flow of the cold, dry northwesterlies is also expected to strengthen by mid-December, he added.        
	Wednesday, according to the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore, is likely to be misty or foggy in the morning with mainly clear skies later in the day.

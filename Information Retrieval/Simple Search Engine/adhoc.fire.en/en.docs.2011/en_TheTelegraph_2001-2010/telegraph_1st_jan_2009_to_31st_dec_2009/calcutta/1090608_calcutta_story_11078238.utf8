The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Wanted: Alumni A-team
                                                                                                               Wanted: Alumni A-team
  - Presidency to tap best brains          OUR BUREAU                          The Presidency College campus on College Street. A Telegraph picture                                        
	Presidency College is set to tap some of the best brains within the alumni as well as outside to lecture its students.        
	The authorities have decided to hire adjunct professors, a privilege granted to the College Street institution when it was accorded partial academic and financial autonomy in July 2007, from the session starting July 2009.        
	The departments will suggest the names of the experts, who could be retired professors of Presidency College, retired professors of other colleges, IIT teachers, ex-students of the college whoever they think will enhance the quality of education at the institution, said principal Sanjib Ghosh.        
	All 21 departments have been asked to recommend the names of adjunct professors they would like to hire within the next few days. We want to start the formalities at the earliest and introduce the lectures from the coming academic session.        
	Ghosh explained that the names suggested by the departments would be rigorously scrutinised by a search committee comprising two external subject experts, two government nominees and the principal. This will ensure only the best brains are invited to deliver the lectures. The adjunct professors we will hire would be highly specialised and experienced.        
	The number of adjunct professors hired by various departments will vary, said Ghosh. Each department will host 20 lectures by adjunct professors in a month. One expert can deliver all the lectures or a department can hire a number of experts.        
	The college will pay Rs 1,000 for each lecture, on a par with what the IITs pay, the principal said, adding the college had asked for Rs 50,40,000 from the state government to fund the lectures.        
	The teachers of Presidency College had demanded full academic and financial autonomy but Calcutta University was opposed to the idea and preferred to keep the institution within its ambit.        
	A committee of seven ex-students was set up to decide the fate of the college. The panel recommended in 2007 that the college be granted partial autonomy and allowed to hold postgraduate classes. The government accepted the recommendation and decided to grant the college funds to hire adjunct professors.        
	A teacher of the college said: The general feeling at the time was that the quality of teaching in the college had gone down. To address that a fund was sanctioned to hire adjunct professors. Sadly, we have taken two years to implement the scheme.

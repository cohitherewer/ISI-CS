The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Teenager missing for six weeks
                                                                                                               Teenager missing for six weeks
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Rishensi Neha Horo                                  
	A 15-year-old girl has been missing from her Taratala home for the past six weeks. Rishensi Neha Horo, a Class X student of St Pauls Boarding Day School on Diamond Harbour Road, went missing on July 31, said her family.        
	Rishensis parents, who believe she was abducted, have accused police of slackness in handling the case. The police did not investigate the case seriously. My daughter has been missing for one-and-a-half months and cops have done little to trace her. We are extremely worried, Rishensis mother Rashi Horo told Metro. She said the family had not received any ransom call.        
	Rishensis father Punit Horo is an employee at the Alipore mint and the family stays at the mint quarters in Taratala.        
	According to a complaint lodged with Taratala police station, Rishensi went missing around 9.30am on July 31.        
	She went out of the house saying she would be back in half an hour. When she did not return till evening, we lodged a missing diary. We are sure that she has been kidnapped, said Rashi.        
	The family suspects a local youth, Sumit Chand Balmiki, is involved in Rishensis disappearance. Rashi said she had seen her daughter talking to Sumit earlier. The officers told us Sumits cellphone records revealed that he used to speak to Rishensi often. We had even named Sumit in the FIR, but we dont know why the police have not arrested him yet, Rashi said.         
	Our officers spoke to Sumit but didnt find anything against him. We are probing whether the girl was having an affair with someone and disappeared on her own. All nearby police stations have been informed about the missing girl, said a senior officer of Taratala police station.        
	According to him, the absence of a ransom call indicated that the girl wasnt abducted for money. She might have been kidnapped by someone who wants to settle scores with her father because of some personal dispute, he said.         
	He added that the investigation had not made any headway because the girls parents had not provided the police with all information about possible personal or family disputes.

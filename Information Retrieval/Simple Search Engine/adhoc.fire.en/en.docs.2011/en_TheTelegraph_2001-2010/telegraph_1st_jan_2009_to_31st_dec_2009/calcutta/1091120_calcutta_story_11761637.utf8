                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Court scan on exam answer
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Thursday directed the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education to re-evaluate within two weeks an answer in the history paper of a Madhyamik examinee.         
	The father of Pritam Das, a Sonarpur Sarada Vidyapith student who had cleared the board exam in first division this year, moved the court after being allowed to go through his sons history and physical science answerscripts under the Right to Information Act.        
	The petitioner alleged that in question 8b of physical science Pritam was not given 2 out of 2 despite answering it correctly. For questions 4a, 4b, 4c and 4e of the history paper the examinee was not allotted part marks and was instead given a consolidated mark.        
	Following a court directive, the board submitted reports by head examiners stating the assessments were correct.         
	Justice Dipankar Dutta on Thursday accepted the boards contention that one mark was deducted in the physical science answer because the examinee did not write a unit.         
	The head examiners report on the history answer, however, did not satisfy the judge.        
	He directed the board to appoint a teacher to re-examine the four parts of the answer without being influenced by the earlier assessment.        
	Pritam got 63 and 50 out of 90 in the written physical science and history tests, respectively.         
	The order is significant because this is the first time the court has asked for the re-evaluation of an answer in a particular paper, said advocate Rabishankar Chatterjee.

                                                                                                               Training centre for varsity staff
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta University has set up a centre to impart training in handling administrative work to its employees as well as those of its affiliated colleges.         
	The centre, the first of its kind in the 152-year-old institution, has come up on the ninth and 10th floors of the universitys Centenary Building on College Street.        
	Non-teaching employees of the university and all our affiliated colleges will be called for the training, said pro-vice chancellor (academic affairs) Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee.         
	Elaborating on the need for such training, he said:Office employees of the colleges often overlook mistakes committed by students while filling up admission, registration or examination forms.        
	These mistakes are detected when the forms reach the university. Considerable time is wasted in processing the forms after correcting the mistakes, said an official.         
	This apart, courses on improving employees computer skills and educating them on new issues such as the right to information will be also organised.        
	The centre will be set up with funds the UGC had sanctioned for the university in 2007 after it was granted the status of a centre of excellence in 2006.

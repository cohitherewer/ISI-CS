The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Dentist rules out surgery goof-up
                                                                                                               Dentist rules out surgery goof-up
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The dentist who Keka Mitra has dragged to the dental council alleging that a surgery by him 14 years ago had paralysed and deformed the right side of her face, has said that such an outcome is not possible from the procedure he had conducted.        
	Amit Roy (senior), who is currently with the Wockhardt Dental Clinic, told Metro that the girl must have later been operated on by someone else who had damaged her facial nerve, resulting in paralysis.        
	Stressing that he had full sympathy for Keka, Roy feared that someone in the medical fraternity with ulterior motives was using her as a pawn.        
	Keka has been suffering from a paralysis of the right side of her face that has led to severe deformity, allegedly after undergoing an operation performed by Roy, in 1995, when she was 12.        
	I carried out an intra-oral (inside the mouth) surgery for a neurofibroma on her jaw. After these surgeries the face swells up but for it to not return to the original form defies medical science, said Roy.        
	He stressed it is not possible to damage the facial nerve during the operation he conducted, as alleged by Kekas mother Kalpana in a complaint filed with the West Bengal Dental Council.        
	The symptoms Keka complained of are unheard of after an operation on the jaw. Damage to a facial nerve from an intra-oral operation is just as impossible, said the dentist.        
	Also, why are they complaining so many years after the incident?        
	Of the complaints lodged by the patient in different forums, Roy said: The one with the West Bengal Dental Council is not supported by relevant documents. The high court has put a stay on further investigation with respect to the two FIRs lodged with Regent Park police station and the complaint with the West Bengal Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, according to law, is not tenable because it was lodged more than two years after the incident.        
	Roy also said he would take the move to defame him head-on and see it through to the end.

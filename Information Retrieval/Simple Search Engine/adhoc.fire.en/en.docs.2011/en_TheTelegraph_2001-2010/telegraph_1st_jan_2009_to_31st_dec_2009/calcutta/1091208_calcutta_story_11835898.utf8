The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Joyride for commuter
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Joyride for commuter
										                                
	They are sleek, spacious and comfortable and a pleasant change from the tin boxes the Calcutta commuter was used to. The new buses bought under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission have partly filled the void created by the phase-out of old, polluting vehicles. They have comfortable seats, ample leg space, large glass windows and low footboards. Metro rides the latest headturners in town

	USP: Frequency and regular fare.        
	Problems: Often gets overcrowded.        
	Commuterspeak: The new buses are wonderful. As a daily commuter, I feel proud to board one of these buses. Not only have they made commuting a lot more comfortable, but have also added elan to the citys transport system, said Salt Lake resident Sushmita Roy, 34, employed with a private bank. The regular fare is a blessing, but it leads to the buses getting overcrowded, she added.        
	The new buses have been a dream-come-true for Tollygunge resident Varun Sawhney, 25, who works as a risk analyst in a multinational finance company. I had seen such buses in Delhi a couple of years ago and used to wish we had such buses in Calcutta too. Its such a pleasant experience to travel in these buses. It feels good just to look at them, Sawhney smiled.         
	Low floor, AC buses                        
	Manufacturer: Volvo.        
	Seating capacity: 40, excluding the driver.        
	Present fleet size: 15.        
	Proposed fleet size: 50.        
	Colour schemes: Orange and red.        
	Run by: WBSTC and private operators.        
	Routes: Connects the airport to Esplanade, Tollygunge, Jadavpur and Garia.        
	Fare: Rs 20-Rs 60.        
	USP: Air-conditioning, boot-space in the belly and no crowding.        
	Problems: Higher fare structure and low frequency (30 minutes to an hour).        
	Commuterspeak: The modish air-conditioned buses without crowds make the journey very pleasant. I used to shell out Rs 150-200 for a prepaid cab ride from the airport to my Kankurgachhi residence. Now I pay Rs 40 for the same journey, said frequent flier Basudeb Mukherjee, 43, a trader.        
	The low frequency is a major problem. I waited for an hour at Esplanade for one of these buses to the airport recently, and almost missed my flight. I doubt if the frequency will go up as hardly anybody boards them because of the higher fare, said Bowbazar resident Harsh Murarka, 29, a travel agent.

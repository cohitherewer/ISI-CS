The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Contraband haul in raid on jail hospital
                                                                                                               Contraband haul in raid on jail hospital
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The Presidency jail                                  
	Bottles of liquor, DVDs of pornographic films, cellphones and a portable media player were seized in a surprise raid on the Presidency jail hospital on Thursday afternoon.        
	A special police team led by the additional director-general of police and the inspector-general of correctional services, B.D. Sharma, conducted the raid.        
	The jail staff were not informed about the raid. Three cellphones with SIM cards, DVDs and a number of objectionable items were seized, said Sharma.        
	No action was taken against any jail employee today. The local police station was informed. The city police department and its Special Task Force wing were alerted, he added.        
	According to an officer who took part in the raid, they were stunned to find liquor bottles under beds in the hospital. It is surprising to us. How could prisoners under treatment procure liquor bottles? he asked.        
	Four prisoners were shifted to the Alipore Central jail hospital and eight to the Alipore Central jail after the raids.        
	Last year, sleuths of the detective department carried out surprise raids on Alipore Central jail and recovered cellphones from the possession of several convicts, including Aftab Ansari, the mastermind of the American Center attack, and extortionist Gabbar.         
	Sources in the detective department said many extortionists operated from behind bars.        
	Last year, a Park Street trader who did not pay heed to extortion calls by a gangster lodged in jail was shot thrice by his henchmen, said an officer of the detective departments anti-rowdy squad.        
	Many prisoners live as comfortably in jail as they do at home. They bribe the jail employees and get everything they want, he added.        
	An officer, who took part in Thursdays raid, said: The nexus between prisoners and jail employees is an open secret. If they had any inkling of the raid, the articles would have been shifted elsewhere and we would not have found anything.        
	Sources in the correctional home and welfare department said the jail minister, Biswanath Chowdhury, was informed about the raid and the seizures.        
	We will recommend strict departmental action and punishment against jail employees who had helped the prisoners smuggle the articles into the jail hospital, said an officer.

                      Keeping alive a classical tradition                    In the history of our rich and soul-searching repository of Indian classical music, tappa has definitely a special niche in northern India and Punjab, in particular. People consider this form of music as songs sung by camel drivers. As years passed, this traditional form reached the shores of the Bay of Bengal and was adopted and nurtured by legendary musician Ramnidhi Gupta alias Nidhubabu. The singing of tappa took new shape and traversed over decades, becoming puratani, a semi-classical form of Bengali songs. Nidhubabu maintained the tradition and continuity of this age-old form of music and propagated it through his renowned disciple Kalipada Pathak, whose legacy, in turn, was inherited by Gopal Chattopadhyay. Anandadhara II Amritadhara, Cycle-2, will take a journey through the puratani tappa of Bengal in the ever-mesmerising and mellifluous voice of nonagenarian Gopal Chattopadhyay, to be followed by the rendition of tappa-based Tagore songs by Rahul Mitra.                  Event: Tappa performance by Gopal Chattopadhyay and tappa-based Tagore songs by Rahul Mitra When: Today at 6 pm Where: Vivekananda Hall, Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, Gol Park

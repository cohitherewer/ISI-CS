          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two snatchers were lynched by a 500-strong mob in Pankuria, Howrah, on Thursday morning, allegedly in front of policemen.         
	The two  Gopal Das, 34, and Biswajit Sardar, 35  were arrested last year in connection with seven snatching cases. They were part of a gang that had been terrorising residents.         
	 On Wednesday afternoon, the duo allegedly snatched a necklace from an anganwadi teacher while riding past her on a motorcycle.         
	On Thursday, morning walkers saw the two riding pillion on a motorcycle as it cruised down Chamrail Road. When some residents recognised the duo and tried to stop the bike, Das and Sardar threatened to slit their throats with knives. This enraged the pedestrians who ganged up and dragged the two off the motorcycle. The third man managed to speed away.        
	Hundreds of men started beating up the two. They became victims of mob fury, said Papiya Mandal, a morning walker. Residents said five cops from Domjur police station, which had allegedly not taken action when complaints poured in against the two, were mute spectators as hundreds hit Das and Sardar with bamboo sticks and iron rods.        
	The deputy superintendent of police, Anuradha Mandal, declined comment on the allegation. She said: The two men were lynched by residents. We have started a probe and sent the bodies for post-mortem.        
	While Sardar was declared brought dead at Domjur hospital, Das died moments after being brought to the hospital.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Italian envoy dies in sleep
                                                                                                               Italian envoy dies in sleep
          OUR BUREAU                          Bruno Campria                                  
	Italian consul-general in Calcutta Bruno Campria died early on Monday at his Alipore residence. He was 55.         
	Campria, who assumed charge in September 2007, died in his sleep and his body was found on the sofa by a domestic help at 8.30am on Monday.         
	Police said Campria was taken to CMRI hospital, where he was declared brought dead. A post-mortem revealed cardiac arrest as the cause of death, said an officer.        
	Its a huge tragedy for the mission and also a personal loss for me since Bruno was a good friend, Gabriele Annis, the political counsellor of the Italian embassy in New Delhi, who arrived in the city after hearing the news, told Metro on Tuesday.         
	The deputy consul at the Italian consulate office in Calcutta, Silvio Pentrella, will assume charge till the Italian government picks a replacement, which could take a couple of months, Annis said.        
	A memorial service will be held at Christ the King church in Park Circus at 4pm on Wednesday. Camprias body will be flown back to Rome on Friday. Campria was organising a piano concert by an Italian duo on October 23 at the ICCR auditorium, which will now be dedicated to his memory, the Italian embassy said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mandeville killer in city remand
                                                                                                               Mandeville killer in city remand
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Kishan Yadav, the killer of Mandeville Gardens resident Usha Chokhani, was brought to the city from Bangalore on Friday and remanded in police custody till January 19.        
	Jawed Shamim, the city detective chief, said Yadav had admitted to killing Usha with a pair of scissors. We will interrogate him to ascertain the exact reason for the murder, said Shamim.        
	On March 16, 2008, 54-year-old Chokhani was found lying in her drawing room with the scissors piercing her neck and a towel lying beside the body. Yadav, who had been appointed as domestic help 10 days earlier, went missing.        
	Police raided Yadavs family home in Banka in Bihar, but he never visited his house after the murder. It took the cops over 10 months to trace him. We nabbed him from a shanty in a labourers colony near Bangalore, said an officer.

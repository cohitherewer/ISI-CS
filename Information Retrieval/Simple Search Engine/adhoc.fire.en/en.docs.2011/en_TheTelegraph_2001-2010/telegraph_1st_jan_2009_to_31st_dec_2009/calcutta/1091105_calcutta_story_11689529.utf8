The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Passengers few for airport service
                                                                            Thursday , November 5 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Passengers few for airport service
          A STAFF REPORTER                          An air-conditioned bus picks up passengers outside the domestic terminal of the airport. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                                  
	Five air-conditioned Volvo buses meant to ferry fliers from the airport have been running half full for more than six weeks because of faulty planning by the state transport department.        
	Most fliers dont know about the service. The bus timings are also not synchronised with the arrival of flights. Moreover, a prepaid booth for the buses is yet to come up on the premises since the transport department had not applied to the airport authorities.        
	I came out of the domestic terminal and paid for a prepaid taxi before seeing the swanky red buses picking up passengers. Had I known about the service I would have opted for it, said Vikash Agarwal, a Salt Lake resident who was returning from Delhi recently.         
	With most fliers still taking taxis out of the airport, the buses are being filled up to just half their capacity, said an official of Kaushik Global Logistics Limited, the state governments private partner in the project. The company also operates inter-city Volvo buses under the name Royal Cruiser.         
	The airport buses currently ply to Tollygunge Metro station on two routes with limited stops. The fare is Rs 20, Rs 40 or Rs 60 depending on the distance travelled. The passengers, many of whom board the buses between the two terminuses, are currently paying their fare to conductors.         
	The prepaid taxis charge at least 60 per cent more than the actual fare. Since there are few other options, people pay up reluctantly. If a Volvo prepaid booth comes up in the airport, thousands of fliers would be benefited, said frequent-flier Sourav Ghosh, a Kasba resident.         
	The letter requesting permission to set up a prepaid booth for the buses has not been sent to the airport authorities because of various reasons, said a government official.         
	Officials of Kaushik Global Logistics Limited said the booth was expected to be installed within a month. Once more buses and more trained drivers arrive, the service will be synchronised with flight timings, said Dhanajoy Singh, the managing director of the company. The fleet is likely to expand by November 19.        
	There are no fixed times for the buses now. Often buses start from the airport when few flights land.         
	Like in the other cities, Volvo will become the preferred mode of transport from the airport. The service will decongest the roads, said Akash Passey, the managing director of Volvo Buses India.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Court axe on road-hog pandal
                                                                                                               Court axe on road-hog pandal
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          A portion of this Kasba pandal must be demolished. (Sanat Kumar Sinha)                                  
	In what should put traffic-stopper pandals in their place, Calcutta High Court on Wednesday ordered a Kasba puja to demolish the illegal portion obstructing a thoroughfare, within 24 hours.        
	If the illegal part is not demolished by tomorrow, the court will ask the state to use police to do the job. If needed, the army will be called, said Justice Sanjib Banerjee.        
	The Kasba RK Chatterjee Road Adibashi Brinda must file a compliance report before the court on Thursday.        
	S.K. Chaudhuri, the additional superintendent of police (industrial), said: We will of course comply with the court order. If the puja committee does not demolish a portion of the pandal within the deadline stipulated by the court, we will take necessary steps.        
	When Metro visited the spot on Wednesday evening, club members had gathered near the 40-foot long pandal to discuss the demolition order. But they refused comment as the matter is in court.        
	The construction of the pandal, completely blocking a lane off RK Chatterjee Road, started a month ago, said a resident. The entrance to the lane has been blocked for 20 days already and there is barely room for a pedestrian to slip through, he said.        
	The Kasba resident was not exaggerating.        
	According to an earlier court guideline, keeping in mind fire safety and other emergency norms, a pandal in a lane must leave at least five feet on either side of the structure for ingress and egress.        
	Wednesdays court order followed a petition by a lawyer, Ipshita Chakrabarti, a resident of RK Chatterjee Road.        
	In her petition, which was moved on August 18, the lawyer alleged that on July 31 she found the pandal being erected by the committee leaving less than one foot space.        
	When I requested them, the committee members told me that they would leave more space for entry and exit. But they did not keep their promise, Chakrabarti said.        
	She first lodged a complaint with Kasba police station. A sub-inspector was sent to the spot, but in front of him the committee members abused me, she complained.        
	On the basis of the petition, the court on July 20 had asked the officer-in-charge of Kasba police station to attend the hearing on Wednesday.         
	On Wednesday, in the presence of the OC, government lawyer Suman Ghosh informed the court that the puja committee had not taken the necessary sanction from the police, CMC, fire services and CESC before erecting the pandal that flouted road rules.        
	When the lawyer appearing for the puja committee on Wednesday tried to argue that the idol had already been placed in the pandal, Justice Banerjee said: When there is a specific rule, every Durga puja committee will have to follow it while erecting their pandals.

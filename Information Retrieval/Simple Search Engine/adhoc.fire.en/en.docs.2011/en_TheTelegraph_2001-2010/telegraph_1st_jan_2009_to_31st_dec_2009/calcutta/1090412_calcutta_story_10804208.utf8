                                      From top: The damaged painting of Tagore; the painting after restoration; the century-old carpet that was restored at Raj Bhavan. Pictures by Amit Datta                           
	Those who restore buildings, paintings or textiles are content to do so in relative obscurity, as the job of the restorer, unlike that of the artist or the architect, does not hold any promise of glory. The restorer does not create a new art object, but ensures that the original object that is damaged is back to its original form or close to it, at the very least.         
	Where the artist enjoys freedom of expression, the restorer has to restrict himself strictly to the parameters (neither more nor less) of the damaged art work. Structure, colour, raw material  everything must correspond to the original work.         
	Raj Bhavan has recently restored a portrait of Rabindranath Tagore by Atul Bose dated August 1936 and a carpet almost a century old.         
	The painting was gifted by the artist to Chakravarthi Rajagopalachari, the first governor of Bengal after the British left. Hanging in the governors study now, it is an elegant portrait with only the poets radiant face and beard painted in soft flesh tints standing out against the sable background.         
	The surface of the painting now glows in the suffused light of the room, but in the recent past its paintwork had started cracking and peeling off, revealing microscopic patches of the naked canvas itself.        
	Now the craquelure is not visible unless one goes close to the painting or uses a magnifying glass. A team of four restorers from the Victoria Memorial Hall headed by veteran conservator Sukanta Basu, who is close to 80, have turned the work picture perfect. The others on the team were Ram Pravesh Sabite, Khokon Raut, Baishakhi Mallik and Dibakar Karmakar.         
	They began their work on December 10, 2008, and continued till March. After a preliminary study, they held a discussion and worked out a strategy.         
	One has to be careful about the strength of the solvent used to clean varnish, many varieties of which are available. We had to be careful about the strength of the solvent. Each problem is unique. Anything we do should not alter the painting. That is our ethics, says Basu.         
	Basu gave a clear idea of the process of restoration, beginning with full documentation. The varnish, he says, had turned yellowish. The paintwork was slightly enlarged, cracked and dry and lifting up, says Basu. The cloth of the canvas, he explained, had a glue coating with a primer that acted as a foundation. On top of that came the paint layers, building up the structure of the painting. The health of the painting depends on the perfect relationship of these elements.        
	The paint layer and the canvas adhere to each other but this may decrease owing to age, transportation, vandalism, climatic change, natural calamity and human intervention, mainly from hack restorers, who can do the most damage.        
	Basu was trained at the Government College of Art and Craft and began his career as a conservator at the National Gallery of Modern Art in Delhi, when he restored its collections of Amrita Sher-Gil, Jamini Roy and Raja Ravi Varma. Later, at the National Museum in 1986, he was involved in a short-lived project known as the National Museum Oil Paintings of Non-Indian Origin.        
	The first task of the restorer is diagnosis of the canvass ailment, he said. Lack of adhesion, brittle paint layer, darkened varnish, what is wrong with the work? A coat of varnish could also pull the paint layer out. A strategy has to be worked out to attack the most vulnerable areas. To arrest further deterioration fine pieces of paper known as facing are pasted on the damaged areas. The paint layer has to be softened and then pushed back and further adhesion has to be incorporated for it to remain stable.        
	For the Raj Bhavan painting, a solvent was applied to remove varnish and in the process the paint layer was softened. Heat was applied with an iron and facing was pasted all over the painting. A consolidant, a mix of wax and resin, was applied on the back of the painting after taking out the canvas from the stretcher. The wax and resin mix penetrated and came to the surface of the paint layer. Then I knew that it was really doing its work, said Basu.        
	The canvas was put back on the stretcher and, the facing and the adhesive that had come in front were removed. Wherever there was loss of paint, puttee was pasted just on that part where the paint had flaked.         
	Flesh tints of almost the same colour as the original and black were applied under a magnifying glass.         
	Care has to be taken that the paint does not come over the original, says Basu. The conservator has to have a good scientific background, a historical perspective, aesthetic sensibility and love for the object. With Basu and his team working for four hours a day, the painting was back in form.        
	The carpet that was restored is known as jail carpet as these were produced at Lahore, Bikaner and Tihar jails and were meant specifically for government institutions. Made of wool and cotton, these were not for sale. The ones at Raj Bhavan are close to 100 years old. A young man from Murshidabad named Mohammad Asgar, who had already restored several carpets at Rashtrapati Bhavan and Hyderabad House, was given the job.        
	Patterned with burgundy and green on a ground of buff, sections of the carpets were moth-eaten and the mesh of cotton threads under the woollen surface had become exposed. White lamb wool from Badai in Jaipur and dyes sold near Jama Masjid in Delhi were used. Small sections of the carpet were framed and the base of cotton recreated, on which the woollen designs were embroidered. The superfluous wool was snipped off later. As in conserving the painting, much concentration is needed for this job. If a stitch goes wrong the entire job is spoilt.        
	Why is restoration so important? Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi has an explanation.  Restoration in maintenance is what recollection is in a narrative: it connects the present with its progenitor, the new with the original. Be it masonry, furniture, a rug or a painting, to restore, to conserve and to revive is to be connected.

          A STAFF REPORTER                          The damaged bus in the ditch. (Gopal Senapati)                                  
	Seven students were injured when the cycle-van taking them to school fell into an 8ft-wide ditch after being hit from behind by a minibus in Howrah on Monday morning.        
	The four boys and three girls, between 11 and 14 years and students of Kendriya Vidyalaya Liluah, sustained cuts and bruises. They were discharged after first-aid from a railway hospital near A Road, where the mishap occurred.        
	The minibus came from behind at high speed and hit our van even though it was moving along the side of the road. Residents rescued us after we were flung into the drain, said Apurba Singh of Class VII. The van-puller sustained minor injuries.         
	Residents damaged the minibus, which was plying on the Bhattanagar-Esplanade route, and pushed it into the ditch. The driver and the conductor fled.        
	Sukumar Manna, the mathematics teacher of the school, said: More than physical injuries, the accident caused mental trauma among the students. They were covered in mud and slush and were crying hysterically. We sent them home since they were not in a position to attend classes.        
	Sukesh Kumar Jain, the additional superintendent of police (town), Howrah, said: The cause of the accident has not been ascertained.        
	Santosh Rout, a local youth who joined the rescue, said: The children survived as the drain was full of muck. He alleged that buses often moved recklessly on A Road.

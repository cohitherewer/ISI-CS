										      book bazaar                        A picture from Ladakh Trance Himalaya and (below) Rana Dasgupta. (Pabitra Das)				                                       
	Rana Dasguptas Solo may seem very despairing and awful, but it is also about hope, says the British-born Delhi-based author about his second book, launched last week at Starmark, South City Mall. Solo is told through the life and daydreams of Ulrich, a 100-year-old man from Bulgaria who hasnt achieved much and has become a metaphor for his own countrys failed history.         
	The book is not about forgetting but about memory. EU is Bulgarias amnesia, he says. Its probably EUs fantasy that Bulgarias violent past will be put to rest, he says. The idea of basing a book in Bulgaria had stayed with Dasgupta for a long time, since the 90s, the time of the countrys economic collapse. The sheer devastation that it wreaked made an impact. I met a man who was middle-class who was begging on the streets and his family were on the streets. Doctors and lawyers were reduced to scrounging through garbage, he explained.         
	It is also about dreams. Before losing his sight Ulrich reads a story in a magazine about a group of explorers who come across a community of parrots speaking the language of a society that has been annihilated in a catastrophe. They cage the parrots and send them home to record what remained of the dead language, but the parrots, already traumatised by the horrors they were witness to, die on the way. Ulrich wonders if he, unlike these parrots, has any wisdom to leave behind, and daydreams of a journey through the twists and turns of the countrys turbulent past. Its like waking after a dream and making connections between what happened to you and what you dreamt connections you dont know of while youre dreaming. There is pleasure in that, he said.         
	Theres rhythm and music too, though he admitted to finding poetry difficult. Rhythm and how the words sound is important to me.         
	Reminding that Flaubert would work out the rhythm of his novel by knocking before hed sit down to write, Dasgupta said: Hed have the rhythm of the entire novel even before he had the words. Now, that doesnt seem as miraculous to me, he said. Hope, dreams and music. What more can one want?        
	In Baul-land        
	They stood out at Oxford Bookstore. In their patch-worked alkhallahs, coloured beads, unkempt appearances, and dubkis (a small tambourine), the baul singers seemed to have lost their way to this elite bookshop on Thursday. But they had not.         
	For author Mimlu Das, with Paban Das Baul and the great Purnadas Baul, was launching a book titled Baulsphere, a gripping narrative on Bauls in Bengal published by Random House.         
	Mimlu, who divides her time between Montreuil (a Parisian suburb), Calcutta, Santiniketan and Boral, writes about her encounters with Paban Das Baul and other bauls, at the Baul festival at Kenduli, Agrodwip and Santiniketan. I chose to tread a very unusual path in following Paban Das to Bauldom, she writes. She has witnessed the mystic, itinerant lives of the Bauls and learnt sexo-yogic secrets and encountered strange things such as a catfish that climbs trees.         
	Her journey began when she met Paban. The book is about the first three years of her travels with Paban to the Baulworld where Paban and I were friend and philosopher (to each other) and we both guided and misguided each other. Paban rounded up the evening with a couple of soul-stirring Baul songs.        
	Ladakh lore         
	The dry, arid, ruggedly beautiful landscape of Ladakh that has often been compared with the moonscape is ideal material for the National Geographic genre of photography.         
	Sankar Sridhar is a young journalist, who has been visiting this desert land of awful splendour for a decade and has camped out in the wilds for months on end.         
	Sankar, who has been trekking for years and has written several articles in which he vividly captures the excitement of outdoor life, has brought out an impressive book on his sojourns in the land that has so much in common with Tibet, titled Ladakh Trance Himalaya.         
	It is mainly a book of lush colour photographs that depict the harsh and barren landscape in all the seasons of a year. Snow-covered or with clouds hanging low, the land looks fascinating and mysterious.         
	The colours of this land are magical in their ever-changing magnificence. From turquoise to gold it is a matter of seconds. Sridhar is an ambitious photographer and some of his vistas with blue-ridged mountains are spectacular. The contrasts of light and shadow in the heavens or down below are truly mind-blowing. So are some of the portraits and coverage of the festivities in Ladakh. In some of the photographs, however, the colours seem a bit too strong. Perhaps the printing was at fault. But overall it is a feast for the eyes.

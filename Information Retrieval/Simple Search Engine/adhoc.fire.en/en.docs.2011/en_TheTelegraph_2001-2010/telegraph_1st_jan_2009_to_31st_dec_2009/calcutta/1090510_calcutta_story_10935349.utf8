The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Frayed jeans, costly shoes
                                                                                                               Frayed jeans, costly shoes
										      book bazaar                        A miniature painting of Krishna and the Gopis				                           
	It was a jugalbandi of the literary variety. An author and a teacher in a conversation about a new novel, The Immortals by Amit Chaudhuri, published by Picador.         
	It was launched at Starmark on Tuesday by poet Utpal Basu, admired much by Chaudhuri, who in turn is much admired by Basu.         
	Basu, while unveiling the book, narrated an anecdote on novel-writing. When Allen Ginsberg was in town I had asked him how one wrote a surreal novel. He said: First fix a time at say four oclock when you start and then stop only on the third day. When you read it, it is a surreal novel. Well I never tried after I heard that, said Basu, handing over the microphone to pr-ofessor Swapan Chakravorty.         
	The poet felt that the Chaudhuri-Chakravorty duet (Chaudhuri is also a classical singer) would be enjoyable and worth recording.        
	The Immortals, Chakravorty felt, was the finest among what Chaudhuri has written so far and in it he finds resonance of The Afternoon Raga, Chaudhuris first, youthful work: Both have the redemptive idea of the ordinary and the commonplace, the importance and significance of the dailyness of every day.         
	The novel revolves around Hindustani classical music and its two protagonists. The old great age of popular music ended by the Seventies. Also the age of Hindustani classical was declining in the Eighties when ghazals were taking over, said Chaudhuri.         
	In The Immortals, Nirmalya, a product of the 21st century, is a 16-year-old with long hair, tall kurta, frayed jeans but expensive shoes. He belongs to the affluent milieu not transformed by globalisation. He is embarrassed by this world of mad energised liberalisation and though he rejects it, he doesnt want to leave it, says Chaudhuri. And he brings in the Hindustani classical music teacher who is from the vernacular world, who wants to succeed in the commercial world.         
	The guru doesnt understand the rich boy who wants to look poor and the boy doesnt understand why the guru wants to sing a ghazal rather than a classical piece.         
	There is a slight comic misunderstanding between the boy and his guru, says Chaudhuri, who reveals that the guru falls ill and dies and as he nears death he begins to see some value in the boys enacted poverty. It is here that the transcendental quality of music is experienced, right in the midst of commercial compromise.        
	Gay straitjacket        
	Only a myopic person would think of attaching tags like gay to writers as imaginative as EM Forster and Christopher Isherwood. By choosing to call his book Gay Writers in search of the Divine, Hinduism and Homosexuality in the Lives and Writings of Edward Carpenter, EM Forster and Christopher Isherwood, Antony Copley not only limits the scope of their writings but also seems to ignore the richness and brilliance of their lives. The book was recently published in Delhi by Yoda Press.        
	By trying to project the Hindu worldview as being gynocentric, and then discovering the alleged homo-eroticism in the figure of Krishna and the Krishna cult, he reduces Hindu mysticism to a joke. However, it has to be admitted that Copley has dug up an immense quantity of material.         
	The chapters dealing with the relationship between Isherwood and Prabhavananda and the spread of the Ramakrishna Mission in America are among the most interesting. It is really amazing that the man who had written The Berlin Stories, on which the film Cabaret was based, was actually a follower of Ramakrishna Paramhamsa, albeit through his disciple.         
	The guru-disciple relationship is well documented although Copley reads all the wrong meanings in something as innocent as a foot massage, enjoying which, traditionally, has been the prerogative of elders and gurus in particular.        
	The problem is the cultural divide. Copley seems to be unaware that till a few decades ago, before the AIDS/HIV scare had imposed a more rigid outlook, male bonding was strong and demonstrative. In mythology, Krishnas famous sakha or friend was Subal, and the two would sit together, arm in arm, discussing the beauty of Radhika. Anybody who has heard palakirtan should be aware of this. Copley obviously has not.

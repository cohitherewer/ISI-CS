                      Kathak creations                    Kathak danseuse Rani Karnaas training under Narayan Prasad and Sunder Prasad of the Jaipur gharana and Shambhu Maharaj and Birju Maharaj of the Lucknow gharana enabled her to develop an integrated style of performance blending the two schools. Her emphasis on the beauty of ang in Kathak and her treatment of padas evoking the beauty of the sahitya are distinct features of her art. This evening, the students of her dance academy, Samskritiki Shreyaskar, will present Kathak Prasang, showcasing Rani Karnaas distinctive approach to Kathak. It will commence with the curtain raiser of Naba Rabi Kirane, a new production to be premiered early next year. Based on choicest classical bandishes or compositions that lend support to well-known Tagore numbers, it is choreographed and will be performed by Debashree Bhattacharya and Sohini Debnath. This will be followed by a short, solo recital by the latter. The concluding item comprises rare traditional compositions from Rani Karnaas repertoire, to be performed by her senior disciples.                  Event: A programme of Kathak dances by artistes of Samskritiki Shreyaskar When: Today at 6.45 pm Where: Gyan Manch

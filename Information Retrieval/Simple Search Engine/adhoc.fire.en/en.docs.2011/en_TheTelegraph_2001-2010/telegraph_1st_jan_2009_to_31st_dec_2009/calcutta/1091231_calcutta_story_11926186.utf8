	State forest minister Ananta Roy on Wednesday expressed doubt over the setting up of the proposed zoo in Sonarpur because of some problems with a group of residents.        
	The 140 families living on the plot identified for the zoo have demanded that they be given alternative accommodation as well as jobs. We are considering the demand for accommodation but cannot accept the other demand, the minister said.        
	Trio held: Three men were arrested in South 24-Parganas on Wednesday in connection with a theft at a forest department guest house in AE Block in Salt Lake on November 14. Police said Ganesh Shikari, Bapi Ghosal and Subhankar Biswas have been remanded in police custody. Two debit cards, Rs 1,500, a laptop and a cellphone had been stolen from the guest house.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Blame game over crane mishap
                                                                                                               Blame game over crane mishap

	The wires of a crane snapped while lifting a concrete slab weighing at least 60 tonne at the construction site of 1.2km interchange between VIP Road and EM Bypass on Saturday night.        
	Several pedestrians had gathered to watch the crane when the slab dropped a few feet to the ground after 9pm. The spot, where a slip road turns left from VIP Road into Salt Lake, is next to a slum where more than 200 people live.        
	The sub-contractor in charge of the crane said that it was being used to lift load higher than its 60 tonne capacity. Mackintosh Burn, which is executing the project, allegedly insisted that cranes of 60 tonne capacity be used to lift slabs weighing much more.         
	According to our estimate, the slab weighed at least 80 tonne. Yesterday as soon as the crane tried to lift it, the wires holding back the boom snapped. As a result, the nearly 20ft boom came crashing down with the load, said Sudama Sau, the sub-contractor in-charge of the cranes told Metro.        
	The rent of a 60-tonne capacity crane is Rs 2 lakh per month. The amount is higher for cranes of higher capacity.         
	A supervisor for Mackintosh Burn, who did not want to be named, alleged the poor condition of the crane was responsible for the mishap. The crane looked weak when it was brought on Saturday afternoon. We asked the contractor to change the crane immediately, he said.         
	Several people were watching the concrete slab being lifted. Luckily, nobody was under the slab. Otherwise, there would have been casualties, said Mohona Seal, who stays in one of the shanties with her husband and three children.         
	A high-tension electrical wire and branches of a tree snapped after the slab landed on them, said Bhabotosh Majhi, who saw the mishap.        
	The slab was to have been a guard wall of the flyover.        
	Residents of the area said there has not been a mishap like Saturdays since work on the flyover commenced a year ago.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Monsoon is here, powered by Aila
                                                                                                               Monsoon is here, powered by Aila
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Monsoon 2009 has done a Jenson Button, racing into Bengal late on Monday, a fortnight ahead of schedule, powered by the turbo drive of Aila.        
	The cyclone accelerated the onset of monsoon which usually reaches Bengal around June 8, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	The southwest monsoon has advanced over most parts of Bay of Bengal, all over the Northeastern states, some parts of north coastal Orissa and most parts of Bengal and Sikkim, he added.        
	According to weather analysts, because it comes close on the heels of Aila, the monsoon will be weaker for the first fortnight.        
	A bulk of the monsoons energy was stolen by Aila over the Bay of Bengal. Therefore, despite the early onset, rainfall in and around the city will not be high initially, said O.P. Sharma, the chief meteorologist of Skymet, a non-government agency for research and analysis on weather.        
	According to our estimates, heavy rain would come to the city only around the second week of June, he added.        
	The forecast was of heavy rain, but Calcutta woke up to clear and sunny skies the day after Aila. Only1.3mm of rainfall was recorded till 8.30pm.        
	Frankly, the clear weather on Tuesday took us by surprise. There was anticipation of heavy rainfall over south Bengal under the residual impact of Aila. But the cyclone dragged with it most of the rain clouds over the southern districts and Calcutta to clear the sky, said a senior Met official. As a result, the weather in and around Calcutta improved drastically overnight.        
	The bright sunshine pushed up the citys maximum temperature by 6.2 degree Celsius in 24 hours, touching 33.1 degree Celsius, still two degrees below normal. The minimum temperature, too, stayed a couple of degrees below normal at 24.9. The humidity ranged from 96 to 59 per cent.        
	The weatherman predicts a warmer Wednesday with scattered rain in and around Calcutta. The sky would be partly cloudy with the possibility of spells of rain or thundershower in some areas, said the Alipore Met office.

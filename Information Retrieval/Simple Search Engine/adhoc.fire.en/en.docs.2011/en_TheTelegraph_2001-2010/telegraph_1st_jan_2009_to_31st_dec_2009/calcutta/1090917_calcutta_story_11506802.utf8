The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Festival organisers suffer budget blues
                                                                                                               Festival organisers suffer budget blues
          SUDESHNA BANERJEE                                            
	The potato  up from Rs 6 per kg in October 08 to Rs 20 in September 09  is a pointer to the Puja price pang.        
	With every festive ingredient costing more this year, puja organisers big, medium and small are struggling to keep budgets from shooting through the pandal roof.        
	Broach the B-word and the Babubagan Club office in Dhakuria erupts. Flowers and fruits will cost at least 20 per cent more, says club president Suman Chatterjee.        
	Rise the budget will, but how much? With a hawk eye on the market, and a prayer on their lips, clubs, apartment blocks and homes are waiting to welcome Ma Durga.        
	Will it be 50 or 75 per cent more for the food expenses, wonder the Chatterjeas at their Ballygunge Park residence, drawing up an estimate for their pujas centenary.        
	Tara Chatterjeas accounts book from Puja 2008, listing bare necessities, says it all. Potato was Rs 6, now Rs 20-22; moong daal was Rs 63, now Rs 80; Gobindabhog rice was Rs 25, now Rs 40-42; ghee was Rs 270, now Rs 290; sugar was Rs 23, now Rs 34 and rising.        
	Every year there is a rise of 10 per cent, but whats happening this year is abnormal, says the retired teacher of Lady Brabourne College, fearing a jump of 25 per cent.        
	The domino effect of the vegetable market is pushing up the pandal cost, from a Rs 2,000 rise at the Sandhead Co-operative Housing Society in Lake Gardens to a Rs 100,000 leap at Babubagan Club.        
	For puja organisers, 2009 is a cruel year. If the downturn has prompted patrons to tighten purse strings, the Aila cyclone has left scars, the prices at the morning market are on fire, and the combination of rain and power cuts is causing delays and adding to the costs.        
	Enough to push para clubs and residential complexes to desperation. We have had to double our subscription rates, from Rs 1,000 to Rs 2,000 per flat, says a puja organiser in a Kankurgachhi complex.         
	We are visiting residents and patrons to raise another round of subscriptions and sponsorships. We are telling them, we too are buying potatoes for Rs 20, pleads a club puja organiser in Ballygunge.        
	Puja planners are also swallowing the bitter pill of cost-cutting. Babubagan Club has slashed publicity (five flex hoardings against last years 20) and sunk its plans for a grand immersion procession.        
	But there can be no rollback of the priests requirements for rituals. After all, there is deliverance from downturn and price rise to pray for.

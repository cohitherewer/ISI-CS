The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Code of conduct up in smoke
                                                                                                               Code of conduct up in smoke
          A STAFF REPORTER                           ACP Anil Kar with a lighted cigarette on Wednesday                                  
	Assistant commissioner Anil Kar stands accused of violating Calcutta polices code of conduct after being caught on camera with a cigarette and without his cap while hauling up an animal rights activist in front of the zoo.         
	Senior colleagues admitted that Kar, photographed by Metro on Wednesday holding a cigarette in his right hand and dragging Peta activist Chiranjeet Karar with his left, broke a British-era code on police propriety. Rule 13 of the PRC (Police Regulation of Calcutta) states that police officers in uniform are forbidden to smoke on the streets, said an IPS officer.         
	But he wouldnt say whether Kar would be penalised for disregarding police etiquette that also requires him to wear the uniform in full, according to Rule 3.         
	Kar, who had targeted the Peta activist for wearing a police uniform and monkey mask, claimed to be unaware of the no-smoking rule. At least I am unaware of any rule of Calcutta police that prohibits an officer on duty  and in a uniform from smoking, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Calcuttas clean-up crusaders
                                                                                                               Calcuttas clean-up crusaders
          
	Want a cleaner city? Just do it yourself. Thats the mantra of young Calcutta, given that the chief minister is busy stemming a political rot, his arch rival is busy hatching political plots and the mayor is in a muddle                  
	DALHOUSIE   
	An energetic band of youngsters descended on Dalhousie recently. Armed with plastic gloves and brooms, they attacked the paan stains, posters and billboards scarring the grand old edifices of Stephen House, Currency Building and more. Metro spoke to two heritage heroes                    
	DHAKURIA LAKES  
	Eleven schools helped to rid the Lakes of its muck last month  La Martiniere for Boys, Birla High, Ashok Hall, Modern High, Shree Jain Vidyalaya, Julien Day, St Xaviers, South Point, GD Birla Girls, St James and St Josephs and Mary. Metro caught up with two young water workers              
	lenin sarani        
	A group of 25 wielded the broom on Lenin Sarani on Saturday morning. The determined lot, comprising students of Saifee Hall and St Josephs College, were led by US consul-general Beth A. Payne. Metro spoke to her and a young member of the broom brigade                
	Alankar Das, 16,   
	is on a roll. First, he helped rid Chandni Chowk of poll clutter, removing flags and posters put up by parties. Next he and his batchmates cleaned up the area around Dalhousies Laldighi. There are only a handful of us working to keep the city clean. If only we could get more schools to join us, rued the Class XI student of St Josephs College.            
	Bharat Bharech        
	This Class XII student of South Point High School has made it to all the clean-up Sundays at the Lakes. Morning and evening walkers throw non-biodegradable garbage into the water. Because of this, rowers like us face a lot of problems, said the Nature Club member, who has persuaded some of his school mates to join him for the drive.                  
	Beth A. Payne        
	Just like we breathe, we should keep things clean, said Payne after the drive. The Calcuttan felt compelled to join the home-grown campaign. We must try to change peoples behaviour. This can be done by coming out and showing by example, through inspiration and motivation or through social pressure, said the do-it-yourself diplomat.                  
	Dipro Basu        
	Also from St Josephs College, this young crusaders motto is united we stand, divided we fall. Asked about the most difficult task of the morning, the sweaty 16-year-old was quick to reply: Nothing is difficult. Cleaning the city is fun and were setting an example.                  
	Aditi Tusnial        
	Aditis objective is to make the Lakes plastic-free. The president of the Nature Club of Modern High School for Girls brought 12 girls on one Sunday and 37 on another. Many of my schoolmates went out of town for the summer holidays. Im sure many others will accompany us once school reopens, said the 17-year-old.                  
	Huzefa Chakkiwal        
	The Class XII student was part of a group of five from Saifee Hall that started the campaign. The number has now grown to 40. As environmental science students, we have to initiate and motivate. We want adults to join us as well. After all, the city is not just ours, but yours, too, said the 17-year-old head prefect of the school.

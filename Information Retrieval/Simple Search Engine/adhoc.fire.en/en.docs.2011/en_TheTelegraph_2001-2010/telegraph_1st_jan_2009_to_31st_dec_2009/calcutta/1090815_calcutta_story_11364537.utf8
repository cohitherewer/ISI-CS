                An Alipore zoo employee was arrested on Friday in connection with the theft of eight Common Marmosets. Police said Ashoke Parui, who looked after the Marmoset enclosures, was held after he gave contradictory statements.    The high court on Friday appointed two special officers to collect the money from ticket sales of Bengali film Poran Jai Joliya Re since August 4 and deposit it in a nationalised bank. The money will be kept in the bank till August 17 when the case will come up for hearing again before the division bench of Justice P.C. Ghosh and I.P. Mukherji. The bench also formally stayed Justice Nadira Patheriyas order staying the screening of the film on the ground that it had infringed on the copyright of Hindi film Namaste London.     Justice Sanjib Banerjee of the high court asked 18 computer training centres, which had to be shut down for a fortnight following an earlier order, to apply by August 24 for being made party to the case. Justice Banerjee said the centres would be heard before any further order was issued in the case.

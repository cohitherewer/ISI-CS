The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Firearms bought with fake licence
                                                                                                               Firearms bought with fake licence
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A racket selling fake arms licences has been active in the city and its suburbs for the past few years, according to Calcutta police.        
	The shop registers of arms dealers in Calcutta indicate that hundreds of guns have been bought over the past three years using forged licences, purportedly issued in other states, said an officer tracking the gang.        
	Those who have licences issued in other states can buy firearms in the city after submitting a no-objection certificate from the licence issuing authorities to the arms act wing of Calcutta police.         
	The racketeers have helped several unauthorised people buy arms against payment of Rs 10,000 to Rs 20,000. The racket has been active for the past few years, said an officer of the detective department.        
	Our officers have made several arrests and seized guns in connection with the racket, said Basab Dasgupta, the deputy commissioner (Reserve Force).        
	Another investigator said the racketeers were forging arms licences issued in two states as it was difficult to verify data with their governments. The administration of both the states hardly respond to our request for information. The racketeers know it and take advantage.        
	Arms licences are in demand among security guards since the permits virtually guarantee a higher salary. According to sources, most forged licences have been bought by guards.         
	There are about 5,000 legal arms licence holders in Calcutta.        
	Officers of the special branch raided hideouts in Burdwan and Durgapur last month but failed to nab racketeers. We reached a couple of hours late but we got some information. The district police are helping us in the probe. CID officers have also been alerted, said the officer.        
	The police have asked the gun dealers in the city to prepare a list of licences from other states against which they sold arms. We are planning to scan all the licences, said an officer.

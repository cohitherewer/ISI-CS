	Shri Shikshayatan School organised a colourful cultural programme to mark its annual day at the Rabindra Sadan auditorium on February 14. The chief guest of the event was Isher J. Ahluwalia, a Padma Bhushan award-winner and wife of the Planning Commission deputy chairman, Montek Singh Ahluwalia.        
	The event began with Heal the world, showcasing a fusion of dances like Bharatanatyam, Odissi, Manipuri, Kathakali, Kathak, ballet and Japanese folk.         
	Performers chose dance forms from India and around the world in an attempt to dissolve all differences and present a united front, said Madhumita Seal, the assistant vice-principal.         
	In keeping with the theme of global unity, students of classes III to V also sang the famous song, We are the world. The high school presented a short adaptation of the casket scene from Shakespeares The Merchant of Venice. Sakina Abbas portrayed Portia wonderfully. Throughout the years, we wait for this big day. We also enjoy the practice sessions that start well in advance, she said.        
	The highlight of the day was a musical, The Pied Piper of Hamlin, that saw 217 kids from the pre-primary section to Class V giving a stellar performance.         
	Ahluwalia, an ex-student herself, shared titbits from her school days with the audience. She remembered how her teacher Bharati Goenka inspired her to pursue economics. Goenka also convinced her father to allow her to study in Presidency College (he had reservations as the college was co-educational).         
	When you get a girl educated, you educate the whole generation. Go for education and combine modernity with tradition, was her message to the present students.                          Chandreyee Bhaumik,

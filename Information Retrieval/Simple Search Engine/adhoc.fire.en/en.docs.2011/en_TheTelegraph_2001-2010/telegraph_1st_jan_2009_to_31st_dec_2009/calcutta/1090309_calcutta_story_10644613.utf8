The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Blast expert on hire drive
                                                                                                               Blast expert on hire drive
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Abu Taher, the alleged Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) explosives expert arrested on Friday, was in the city on a recruitment drive, police said.        
	He came here to set up a LeT module named Tanzeem-e-Mujahideen, which was supposed to execute subversive activities under instructions from Indian Mujahideen. His plan was to spend a couple of days in Calcutta before heading for north India, said an officer of the Special Task Force who is in the team that has been interrogating Taher, alias Mohammad Zakaria, since his arrest.        
	Indian Mujahideen was allegedly behind last years serial blasts in Bangalore, Jaipur and Ahmedabad.        
	Taher, who was arrested as soon as he got off the Lalgola Passenger at Sealdah station, apparently told the interrogators that his brief was to recruit youths for the Tanzeem, whose primary responsibility would be to provide logistic support to LeT and allied groups.        
	According to the police, this was Tahers first visit to Calcutta.        
	The LeT brass had asked him to reach Jammu and Kashmir via Delhi after assembling the Calcutta module, the STF officer added.        
	The sleuths have also learnt that Zakir Rehman Lakhvi, a key LeT operative accused of masterminding the Mumbai attacks, and Abdul Karim Tunda, the outfits chief recruiter in Bangladesh, had sent Taher on the recruitment mission after noticing his mobilisation skills during his stint as a madarsa teacher in Rajshahi.        
	As a teacher, the 45-year-old had motivated many youths in Bangladesh to join the terror network over the past 10 years, said another officer working on the case.        
	Asked what had prompted LeT to decide on forming a new module, the officer quoted Taher as having said: Law-enforcing and intelligence agencies are now focussed on Indian Mujahideen, which had plotted a series of blasts in India. LeT wants Tanzeem to finally act as the front outfit of Indian Mujahideen in an attempt to hoodwink security forces.        
	Taher, originally from Bihars Katihar who shifted to North Dinajpur and then to Bangladesh in 1997, had reportedly earned kudos from Lakhvi for his skills in handling explosives. The sleuths claimed that Taher had supplied explosives used in as many as 24 blasts in India. Taher met Lakhvi during his training at a LeT camp in Muridke, near Lahore.

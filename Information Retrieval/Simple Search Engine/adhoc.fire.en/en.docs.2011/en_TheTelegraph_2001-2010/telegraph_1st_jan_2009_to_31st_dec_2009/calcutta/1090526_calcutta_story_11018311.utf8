The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Early exit from office and class
                                                                                                               Early exit from office and class
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Offices and colleges wore the bandh look on Monday afternoon after the cyclone warning was sounded.        
	None of the Sector V companies declared a holiday but allowed employees to leave early. One of the first companies to react to the warning was IBM, which asked employees who wanted to go home before the storm hit to leave immediately. Most of us left office by 3pm so that we could reach home before 4pm, said an employee.        
	Cognizant Technology Solutions and Tata Consultancy Services provided regular updates on the cyclone to employees through their internal website. Employees were told that they could leave if they had finished their work. Few took the risk of staying back.         
	Acclaris, which had low staff strength because of a holiday in the US, also asked employees to head home early. We have informed our clients in the US that there might be disruptions on Tuesday as well, said Kalyan Kar, the managing director.        
	Writers Buildings, where only 10 per cent of the employees had turned up, was deserted by 3.30pm.        
	Private sector banks like Axis, ICICI and HDFC closed by 3pm. Nationalised banks, like SBI and Allahabad Bank, were, however, open all day.        
	Airtel sent an SMS to their employees in Calcutta asking them to leave office by 3.30pm.        
	Hindustan Motors decided to keep its Uttarpara factory closed on Tuesday.        
	The headcount on campuses was just as low. The Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute, which re-opened on Monday after nearly two months, saw very low attendance. Mostly hostel students roamed around the classrooms. Teachers called it a day early and headed home.        
	A number of trees were uprooted on the Jadavpur University main campus, blocking some of the gates.

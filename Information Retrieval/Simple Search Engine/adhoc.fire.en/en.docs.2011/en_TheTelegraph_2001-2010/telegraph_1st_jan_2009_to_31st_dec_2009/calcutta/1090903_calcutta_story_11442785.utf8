The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Marmoset cops suspended
                                                                                                               Marmoset cops suspended
          OUR BUREAU                          Raj Saikia in court on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	The four cops from whose custody marmoset theft accused Raj Saikia fled while being brought to the city from Chhattisgarh were suspended on Wednesday.        
	Saikia slipped out of an air-conditioned coach of the Down Ahmedabad Express at Jharsuguda station in Orissa early on Monday while his minders were taking a nap, violating rules.        
	The same cop team rearrested him 16 hours later from the outskirts of Durg, where he lived with his family.        
	The sleuths accompanying Saikia have been suspended for dereliction of duty. Departmental proceeding have been started against them, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters).        
	The four cops are inspector Debasish Sarkar, sub-inspector Prasenjit Bhattacharya and constables Samsher Khan and D.G. Mahato.        
	A probe by senior officers revealed that Saikia and Khan were sharing an upper berth in coach A-I. The accused was in cuffs, the other end of which was locked to the berth chain.        
	Mahato was on the opposite berth while Sarkar and Bhattacharya occupied the lower berths. Around 4.45 am, Saikia noticed the cops had dozed off and pulled his wrist off the handcuff, said an officer.        
	The rule forbids cops from lying down or sleeping while escorting an accused. The sleuths were overworked and have admitted to dozing off, said a senior officer.         
	Alipore zoo director Raju Das said on Wednesday that the rescued marmosets were recovering from the stress they were subjected to at Alipore zoo hospital. The animals would be quarantined for the next 10 days.        
	They are stable and are having their normal diet of sweet lime, bread and glucose water, said Das. Zoo doctors and doctors of the animal husbandry department were on call round the clock for the animals, he added.        
	Experts said one of the eight stolen marmosets that didnt survive must have died because of excessive stress and mishandling. This means the other monkeys, too, were subjected to the same rigour, said an expert.        
	Common Marmosets, worth Rs 1 lakh each in the illicit market, have become a major draw in the zoo since the theft came to light on August 9.        
	The rescued animals, however, would not go back to the enclosure from where they were stolen. Das said the seven monkeys would be put in an enclosure next to the one housing eight other marmosets. The enclosure from which the marmosets were stolen was not their permanent home. They were being kept there for the purpose of breeding. When they return from hospital, they will go back to their original enclosure, said Das.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Scurry to show Eden in new light 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Scurry to show Eden in new light 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The Cricket Association of Bengal wont delay replacing the ageing floodlights at Eden Gardens beyond the next edition of the IPL, lest Dark Disaster III ruins its World Cup like a poor wicket queered Delhis pitch on Sunday.         
	The near-blackout at Eden last week  the second mid-match fiasco after the one during the inaugural IPL in April last year  prompted the CAB to draw up a Rs 4.5-crore plan to overhaul both the lighting and the power supply systems.         
	The new lights cant be installed in time for IPL-3 but the CAB has begun scouting for high-performance generators to power the floodlight towers without any voltage fluctuations when the Kolkata Knight Riders play their home matches. According to experts, the present lighting system  the oldest in an Indian stadium  cannot withstand even the slightest voltage fluctuation.        
	Officials said the CAB was in talks with Philips to import the latest power-efficient, wide-beam lamps from Singapore to replace the old ones after IPL-3. We are also looking for generators capable of producing around 750KVA power for the four towers. One thing is for sure: we will no longer depend on the CESC for power supply to the towers, said Chitrak Mitra of the CAB.        
	Each tower of lights at Eden now has 216 metal halide lamps that receive power through five phases. The wide-beam lamps that CAB is eyeing as replacement are designed to consume less power and cover a larger area.

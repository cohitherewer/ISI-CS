                      Classical vocal traditions on celluloid                    Films Division, Government of India and Nandan, West Bengal Film Centre, jointly present the third edition of the series, Classical Singers on Celluloid, featuring documentaries made on great Indian classical vocalists. Veena Sahasrabuddhe (dir: Firoze Chinoy; 6 pm) is a biographical documentary on this highly-acclaimed khayal singer. Originally a student of Kathak, she was initiated into this style of music by her father. The fundamental values of the Gwalior gharana and some parts of the Kirana and Jaipur gharanas characterise her unique style of singing. Dhrupad is the oldest surviving form of Hindustani classical music. Dagar (dir: Arvind Sinha; 6.45 pm) is a slow, meditative journey into the musical life and traditions of the Dagars, who have been practising dhrupad for 20 generations. Fusing the depth of the Dagars music heritage with the hurly-burly of the modern, the films mood ranges from the occasionally playful to the pure and the profound.                  Event: Screening of documentaries on Indian classical singers When: Today; 6 pm onwards Where: Nandan III

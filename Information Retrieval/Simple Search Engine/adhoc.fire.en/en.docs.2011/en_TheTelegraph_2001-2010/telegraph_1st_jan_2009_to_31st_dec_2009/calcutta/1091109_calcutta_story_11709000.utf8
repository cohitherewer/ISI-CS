                                                                            Monday , November 9 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Manpower mantra to beat downturn
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Changing times call for changing strategies to manage manpower. That was the consensus at a conference organised by the Executive Recruiters Association along with The Telegraph Jobs on the role of HR in the changing economy.        
	Over 160 people, from CEOs of recruitment firms and HR heads of companies to B-school boys and girls, attended the event on Friday to understand the way the HR wind would blow post the downturn.         
	According to the association, the theme was selected because of its relevance to the current economic conditions.        
	We are in the middle of a global downturn and organisations need an impetus to change their fortunes. We tried to address how HR could play a role in bringing about a change in the economy, said R.P. Yadav, the chairman of the association.        
	The first positive indicator of the turning of the tide is the increase in hiring and that is where HR can play a role, said Anindo Dey, the convener of the Calcutta chapter of the association.        
	Participants addressed a range of issues, from emerging trends in HR to challenges of bulk recruitment.        
	The speakers included Sai Babu, the vice-president of Wipro BPO, Hemant Kanoria, the chairman and managing director of Srei Infrastructure Finance Ltd, and Rahul Maitra, the chief manager (HR) of Tata Tea.        
	We discussed not just strategies but also what we learnt from the crisis, added Dey.        
	It is a time when right-sizing will be of key importance to maximise resource utilisation. Functions like staffing, payrolls and recruitment will be outsourced, said Yadav.        
	The bottom line was that HR was going to play a bigger role in the recovering economy than it had in the past. HR has not been given enough importance but it has propelled the economy. It is going to become an indispensable part of the creation of a robust economy, summed up Dey.

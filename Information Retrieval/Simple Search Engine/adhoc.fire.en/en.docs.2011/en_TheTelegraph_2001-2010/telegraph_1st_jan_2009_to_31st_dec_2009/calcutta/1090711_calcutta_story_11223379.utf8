          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	School education minister Partha De, who met representatives of 27 schools on Friday, even hinted at framing a rule that would require the institutions to take the governments consent before effecting a fee hike.                    
	In May, the government had issued a circular asking the private schools to take the guardians into confidence before deciding on a fee hike. This time, the education department asked the 27 schools  including Loyola High, Queen of the Missions and St Pauls  to send their representatives to the meeting where the minister renewed the appeal.

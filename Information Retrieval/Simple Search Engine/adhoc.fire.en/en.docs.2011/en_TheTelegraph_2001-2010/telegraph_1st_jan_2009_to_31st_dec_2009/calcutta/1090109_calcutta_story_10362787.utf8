The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Go-slow in death probe
                                                                                                               Go-slow in death probe
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two days have passed since 23-year-old Pintu Sharma was found dead on a rail track near Liluah station in Howrah, but Government Railway Police (GRP) personnel havent visited the spot yet.        
	Pintu, a resident of McKenzie Lane in Howrah, was allegedly having an affair with Suman Rajak for the past two years. His family claimed Pintu was killed by Sumans father Suresh as he didnt approve of the match and had even threatened Pintu.        
	Bharatlal Meena, the superintendent of railway police, Howrah division, said: We have started an unnatural death case and will formally begin the probe after we receive the post-mortem report.         
	No one has been interrogated as no specific complaint was made, he added.        
	The GRP questioned Suresh, who is a bank manager, and his daughter on Wednesday after Pintus father Sanjiban made a verbal complaint.        
	One of Pintus friends said the police were trying to pass off the death as a suicide, which is why they were not pursuing the case properly. This is probably because Pintu belonged to a poor family. Even if Pintu killed himself, it must be found out whether anyone drove him to take the extreme step, he said.        
	Pintus parents also admitted they were against the relationship.         
	I told my son we didnt approve of her. Besides, the gap in our financial status would have caused a rift in their relationship. But Pintu was determined to marry her, said Sanjiban.

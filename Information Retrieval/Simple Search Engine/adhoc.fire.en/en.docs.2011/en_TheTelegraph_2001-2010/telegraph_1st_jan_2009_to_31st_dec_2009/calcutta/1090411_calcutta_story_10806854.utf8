The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Wall war draws blood
                                                                                                               Wall war draws blood
  - Lack of blanket ban fuels graffiti fight          A STAFF REPORTER                          The Trinamul graffiti on the KC Road wall that led to the clash and firing on Thursday night. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                        
	A north Calcutta neighbourhood on Thursday night witnessed the near-fatal consequences of the Election Commissions failure to impose a blanket ban on wall graffiti.        
	The first shots in the wall war raging across the city rang out in Cossipore, injuring a 68-year-old Trinamul supporter. The clash was not between a graffiti gang and the owner of the wall  who was forced to remain a silent spectator  but between rival parties.        
	Jangbahadur Rai, who suffered injuries in the chest and shoulder, was operated on at RG Kar hospital and is in a critical condition. Alleged CPM cadres also assaulted his three sons and daughter. Eldest son Binod, hit on the arms and back with a chopper, has also been operated on.        
	According to the allegation of the Rais, CPM cadres set upon the brothers near their home for painting a small Trinamul graffiti on a godown wall on KC Road which the ruling party claimed to have reserved earlier.         
	When Jangbahadur rushed to their rescue the cadres fired six bullets at him, four missing the target.        
	Neither the Trinamul nor the CPM sought consent of the owner for what they had been fighting over. CPM cadres have made it a pre-poll routine to paint graffiti on the wall without bothering to seek our permission, said the manager of the godown that stocks light fittings.        
	The cadres had even forced us to plaster a part of the brick wall for the convenience of its painters. We dont dare protest against them. This was the first time the Trinamul, too, painted its graffiti on the wall, the manager added.        
	C.R. Das, the returning officer of Calcutta North, expressed helplessness, saying no one had lodged any complaint over the use of the godown wall by political parties without the owners consent. We can ask the cops to take action only after they come to us with specific complaints.... It was a shameful act on the part of the parties.        
	With the mandatory permission being reduced to a farce and political parties considering it their right to grab private walls, residents fear Thursday nights violence could happen again. The only way to avoid such incidents is to impose a blanket ban on wall graffiti, said a resident who did not want to be named.        
	Detective chief Jawed Shamim said an attempt to murder case has been started against five men. All five, believed to be CPM supporters, have been arrested, including Jitendra Kumar who had allegedly pulled the trigger.         
	The Trinamul candidate for Calcutta North, Sudip Bandopadhyay, said: The CPM believes that the walls they use during Brigade rallies belong to them.        
	CPM candidate Mohammad Salim said: I am not aware about the political affiliation of the attackers. I believe the Trinamul is giving a political colour to the issue.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sector V status for Bantala leather hub
                                                                                                               Sector V status for Bantala leather hub
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          The entrance of the leather complex. A Telegraph picture                                  
	The state government is planning to declare the Bantala leather complex a notified area, like Sector V, so that an authority could look after its infrastructure and impose taxes on units operating there, an official in the chief ministers secretariat said.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has approved the idea floated by the industries department. The urban development department will draw up the modalities for the switch. The plan is at a nascent stage but the chief minister has given his nod, the official said.        
	The IT Park, which has been carved out of the leather complex, will not be part of the notified area.        
	The 1,300-acre Calcutta Leather Complex, around 14km from Science City, is presently administered by a state-appointed panel.        
	The state government wants to set up a notified authority for the complex that will have statutory powers to collect taxes and other user charges and can administer the area in a smooth and orderly manner, said an official of the industries department.        
	Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharyya said: I have heard about the proposal... but things havent moved much. If the conversion happens, we will have to empower the body with powers of raising revenue. For that, legislative sanction will be necessary.        
	The state had joined hands with a private firm, ML Dalmia amp; Company, to set up the leather complex in the mid-1990s after the Supreme Court had ordered tanneries out of the city. The tanneries started shifting from 2004.        
	But with complaints of mismanagement pouring in, the state decided to hand over the administration of the complex to a new authority by declaring it a notified area.        
	The functioning of the state panel, which doesnt have resources to spend on infrastructure, has drawn criticism from various stakeholders, including the tannery owners and the developers of the Rs 1,500-crore project.        
	Metro had published a series of reports highlighting the problems of doing business in the Bantala complex.        
	A few years ago, the state government had converted Sector V into a notified area and handed over the administration to the Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority. The results are encouraging, prompting us to replicate the model in Bantala, a municipal affairs department official said.

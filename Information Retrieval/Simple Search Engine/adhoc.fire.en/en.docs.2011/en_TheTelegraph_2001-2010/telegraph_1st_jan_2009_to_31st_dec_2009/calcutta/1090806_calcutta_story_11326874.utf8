The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Modern High School rejoinder
                                                                                                               Modern High School rejoinder
                            
	Devi Kar, the principal of Modern High School for Girls, has sent the following letter, in response to the report headlined Two schools of thought in Metro on July 27.        
	I am writing with reference to the front-page article in Metro section of The Telegraph, which seeks to compare the stand taken by us regarding our school buses with the action taken by South Point School.         
	You may have a difference of opinion with us, and are certainly free to criticize, but this article would seem to have some concealed motive which has nothing to do with clean air. Considering that several schools have replaced their buses, I see no reason to single out South Point School in an apparent effort to give the matter a Birla vs Lodha slant. This is invidious and highly objectionable. In any case it is no concern of ours which school belongs to which group.         
	We have very friendly relations with all schools  South Point School included and do not wish these relations to be jeopardized by a misconceived attempt to pit one school against another. Education involving schoolchildren is far too important to be dragged into such controversy in an apparent effort to provide cheap entertainment to the undiscerning. The Telegraph prides itself on its close relationship with schools and students, and should have greater sensitivity than to print such a malicious piece.         
	We also object to the implication that we have been lacking in foresight by not replacing our buses in a phased manner over several years. We have not done anything illegal so far and are not about to do so now. Moreover, we are very proud of our established reputation as an environment-friendly school. We will allow our old buses to ply if the Court gives permission and only if they are certified fit by all relevant authorities. While we have no need to justify our course of action to anybody, perhaps this letter, if you choose to publish it, will at least give undistorted information to your readers.         
	In conclusion, I would like to point out that no one from The Telegraph has come to see us about this, to find out in detail what we are actually doing or why we are doing it. Furthermore, the case is still in Court, and therefore the matter should not be the subject of speculation or comment.        
	Metro replies        
	Metro had no intention to pit one school against the other but to draw attention to the fact that one school has voluntarily phased out old vehicles while another has gone to court to try to retain buses above 15 years old.         
	The Telegraph and Metro have no concealed motive as the letter says. The motive is transparent: the paper has been at the forefront of a long campaign to clean Calcuttas air that has imperilled, most of all, the health of the citys children.        
	The Metro report at no point mentioned that Modern High had done anything illegal. The point of the report and the comparison was to highlight the different methods adopted by two reputable schools which are expected to be role models for children in matters as life-threatening as pollution.        
	The school had first approached the state environment department seeking an exemption for its old buses, but the department had refused, citing how old and polluting buses were affecting children the most. The school then moved the high court and pleaded that its buses be spared the government notification banning them from August 1 on the ground that they were in good condition and were not being used as commercial vehicles.        
	The Supreme Court has made it clear that age  defined as 15 years and above  and not emission norms (good condition) is the bar for phase-out of commercial vehicles. The Supreme Court has also reiterated that school buses are commercial vehicles.        
	The high court has told Modern High that it will allow its old buses to ply only if they are converted to clean fuel (LPG in this case). It has refused to comment on the matter regarding their status as commercial vehicles.        
	Metro had on July 16 reported how the Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI), the central body approving transport vehicles, cannot give the green signal for the switch of Modern Highs fleet of diesel-driven buses to LPG because such a conversion is not permitted under the Central Motor Vehicles Act. There is no defined safety or emission standard for the same.        
	Metro has constantly been in touch with the lawyers representing Modern High, after school officials refused comment saying that the matter was in court.         
	Finally, there is no law prohibiting reporting of cases under way in courts.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mixed-bag batch at Joka 
                                                                                                               Mixed-bag batch at Joka 
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Classroom discussions at the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta will have an extra edge this year with the 2009-2011 batch comprising an eclectic mix of students not only from the corporate world but also from entertainment and sports.         
	The batch includes a rock-climbing instructor, an Indian Idol participant, owners of start-up ventures, an aspiring entrepreneur and a number of students who have already worked with the popular recruiters on the Joka campus.        
	For rock-climbing instructor Chanderdeep Ekka, IIM Calcutta is a necessary step to setting up his equipment and adventure promotion company. I am not looking at rock-climbing as a career. I plan to start an equipment and adventure promotion company, for which I need training. This is what I hope to gain from an MBA degree, said Ekka, an IT engineer from Jadavpur University.        
	The boy from Binnaguri in Jalpaiguri district hopes his five years experience in rock-climbing and mountaineering will enrich his batch. I know well what risk and trust mean, he said.         
	Hoping to make a mark in the singing industry, Indian Idol contestant Adamya Chandra, 23, is eager to pick up management tips at IIM. I could not make it to the top 30 in Indian Idol 2 because I was not a trained singer. This made me realise the importance of training and experience in professional life, and thats why I am here, said Chandra, who had made it to the top 172 in the contest.         
	Amateur lepidopterist (one who studies butterflies) Vivekanandan M, on the other hand, is planning to start a butterfly farm chain. With seven start-up company owners as batchmates, he hopes to gather the necessary skills during his MBA. To convert my idea into reality I need a strong base in management, said Vivekanandan, who worked for over two years with Cognizant Technology Solutions as a programme analyst.         
	Students and teachers at the institute are excited too. We have such a mixed-bag batch  each of them will bring a different perspective to classroom interactions, said a first-year student at the premier B-school.

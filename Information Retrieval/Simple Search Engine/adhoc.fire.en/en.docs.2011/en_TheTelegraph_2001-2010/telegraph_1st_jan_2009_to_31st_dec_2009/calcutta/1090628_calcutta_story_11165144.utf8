The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Is it a toy, is it a gadget? Its a rath
                                                                                                               Caleidoscope      Is it a toy, is it a gadget? Its a rath
										                        Lost tradition?				                           
	In the days of yore children would save money to buy little plastic toys from Rather mela  little traffic lights, utensils, dolls. Today the fair has all but lost its charm. The offerings are the same at the famous Rather mela at Moulali: colourful birds and little rabbits in cages, pretty bangles, beads, jars of pickles, toys, knick-knacks, household goods, even suitcases. Its not cool enough.         
	Kids who play at playstations are not tempted by old merry-go-rounds, and modest plastic aeroplanes and cars are hardly attractive to those used to remote-control operated automobiles. So its only those who dislike or are unable to afford the pleasures of the mall who throng the fairground. And women on their way back from work, who stop by to pick up samosas and sweets and pickles. They are cheaper at the fair.        
	Not just the fair, the concept of Rath doesnt appeal to the young any more.         
	My son was just not interested, said Smriti Roy, in her 30s, whose mother-in-law had got a Rath for the little boy and was very excited about it. Another woman said her niece had installed her dads mobile where the idols should have been. Another proof that we worship technology.         
	GeNext challenge         
	Santoshi Mahato, a student of Class IX at Naba Disha School, Cossipore, has her hands full. School play rehearsals have extended to practice sessions at home and in the locality, to spread a message. We must all start somewhere, she says.         
	On June 25, to commemorate International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking (June 26) in association with Calcutta police, the Inner Wheel Club of Calcutta, Mahanagar, organised an event with schoolchildren under the Gariahat flyover. The students made short dramatic presentations.        
	Students of Naba Disha School presented Khatarnak, which showed college students dissuading a drug user, and Sri Gandhi Vidyalaya students portrayed a domestic scene with an alcoholic husband and his suffering wife.         
	A slide show on what parents can do to help their children combat drugs and how marijuana use can be detected was presented.         
	Moonwalk tips        
	If Michael Jackson is beyond access today, some bot tola publications sparked by the popstars moves have long gone out of print too. Youngsters visiting the book fair in the Eighties would recall the chapbooks that promised Breakdance Shikhun Saat Diney (Learn Breakdance in Seven Days), alongside titles on kabiraji remedies and yoga postures. These books contained black-and-white sketches of different steps of moonwalking and all else that livened immersion processions. That was self-help in pre-MTV days.

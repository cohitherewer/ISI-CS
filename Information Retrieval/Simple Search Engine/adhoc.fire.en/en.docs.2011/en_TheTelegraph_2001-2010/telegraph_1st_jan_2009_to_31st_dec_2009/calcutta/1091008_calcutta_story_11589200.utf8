The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Man held for wife murder
                                                                                                               Man held for wife murder
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 24-year-old man was arrested on the charge of setting his wife on fire at their Jorabagan home late on Tuesday. Police said Vicky Singhs wife, Kiran, 17, was taken to a hospital in Burrabazar by her in-laws with 80 per cent burns. She later succumbed to her injuries.        
	Vicky, an autorickshaw driver, married Kiran in May. It was an arranged match. A probe revealed he used to torture her for dowry, said an officer of Jorabagan police station.        
	He said Vicky had told the cops that Kiran was cooking when her clothes caught fire around 9.30pm on Tuesday. But we are suspecting foul play as Vicky gave contradictory statements, he said.        
	Vicky was arrested following a complaint by Kirans parents that she was tortured mentally and physically by her husband and in-laws. He has been remanded in police custody for seven days. We are looking for Vickys parents, who are absconding, the officer added.         
	A police team visited the area where the Singhs lived and spoke to some neighbours. They said Vicky used to beat his wife often. We have recorded their statements, the officer said.         
	In another incident, homemaker Mausami Ghosh, 42, allegedly set herself ablaze at her Amherst Street home on Wednesday afternoon. The police said she was mentally unstable. A probe revealed Mausami had dunked herself with kerosene.        
	The police have ruled out foul play. She is survived by her husband and a 12-year-old son. She was suffering from depression, said an officer.

                                                                                                                   Free speech, but with caution

	It was a daylong marathon war of words at the regional finals of Debating Matters, the inter-school competition organised by the Institute of Ideas, UK  in association with British Council  at the Indian Council of Cultural Relations.         
	After several qualifying rounds, in which schools like Loreto Sealdah, Modern High for Girls and Ashok Hall participated, it boiled down to the boys of St Xaviers Collegiate School and Don Bosco, Liluah, (DBL) locking horns in the finals. Their subject was Free speech is not an absolute right.        
	People often misuse their right to free speech, said Ananda Menon of St Xaviers. In response, Surat Bhattacharya of DBL said that without free speech, there could not be free dissemination of ideas.         
	Judges Stuart Simpson, Rajiv Ginodia and Reba Som posed questions to debaters, like who would decide the restrictions to be imposed on free speech. Participants also posed questions to each other.         
	If absolute free speech is not guaranteed, wont we be moving towards dictatorship? asked one. There are bound to be clashes but the spirit of tolerance should be there, summed up Surat.         
	St Xaviers were adjudged the winners. I enjoyed the pattern of the debate, with participants defending their views, said Sumana Nandy of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan. The regional finals were followed by a national round in New Delhi on January 17, where DBL was a runner-up.

	Netaji Indoor Stadium turned into a fun zone at the annual socio-cultural extravaganza of Indira Gandhi Memorial Group of Schools in January.        
	The show this year was a protest against terrorism. Aimed to convey the message of Ekta, the programme  so named  called for solidarity for national integration.         
	It got under way with a peace march from the Gostho Pal statue to Netaji Indoor Stadium, where 400 students walked with banners protesting the mindless killings and terror attacks. Participants included eight schools under the banner of Indira Group, six from West Bengal and two from Delhi.        
	Present on the occasion were Subodh Kant Sahay, the Union minister of state for food processing industries, Justice Shyamal Sen, a former governor of West Bengal, and Tarun Dutta, a former chief secretary of the state.         
	Justice Shyamal Sen said teachers play a vital role in building a nation. It is their responsibility to ensure that students work not just to establish themselves but also for the cause of the downtrodden, he added.         
	Dressed in white and red, the tots of the Dum Dum branch twirled to Bum bum bole (from the film Taare Zameen Par), while the pre-primary students of the Barasat branch danced to Alisha Chinais hit Made in India.         
	A dance programme on Indian films, depicting their journey from the black-and-white era to the present times, was a huge hit. There was yet another skit, Mere Watan ke Logon, followed by a Punjabi folk dance performance and a medley of dance forms, including salsa, tango and Mexican.         
	The daylong programme saw the participation of 3,700 children.         
	The terrorist attacks in Mumbai have left us stunned. We wish to send a message of peace through our programme, said Rajesh Singh, the chairman of the Indira Gandhi Memorial Group of Schools.         
	The icing on the cake came in the form of singer Sanchita Bhattacharya of Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Lil Champs fame, who belted out numbers like Ae mere watan ke logo and Dil diya hai, jaan bhi denge.         
	Jhinuk Mazumdar

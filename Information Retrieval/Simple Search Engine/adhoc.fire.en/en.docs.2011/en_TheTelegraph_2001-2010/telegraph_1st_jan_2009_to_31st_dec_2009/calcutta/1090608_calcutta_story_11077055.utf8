The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Swine flu suspect walks out
                                                                                                               Swine flu suspect walks out
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The Telegraph report dated May 30 on the ordeal of Sushmita Biswas and her child                                  
	A homemaker quarantined at the Infectious Diseases Hospital for suspected swine flu and denied medical attention for hours walked out in front of two nurses early on Sunday and returned home to Kalyani.        
	Sutapa Bhattacharya, who had been to Singapore with her family on vacation, was despatched to the Beleghata hospital after she landed at the airport on Saturday night.        
	The 46-year-old said she wanted to leave after signing a risk bond but was not allowed to do so by the nurses in the isolation ward.        
	After lying untreated for a couple of hours in the ward and failing to bear the mosquito bites, the woman decided to walk out of the hospital with her family members, who were allowed inside the ward meant for quarantined patients.        
	Sources said the two nurses in the ward made no attempt to stop Sutapa from leaving. The authorities came to know about the incident later on Sunday morning and lodged a complaint with Beleghata police station.        
	Health services director Aniruddha Kar said: WHO guidelines are followed when someone is sent to the isolation ward.... I have to first find out the course of events... there are provisions to send the police and bring the woman back.        
	On May 27, Sushmita Biswas, an NRI, and her two-year-old son were quarantined at the hospital for suspected swine flu. They had to spend two days in the dirty, mosquito-infested ward.        
	Sushmita could not use the ward toilet as it was too filthy. The mother and child were released after they tested negative (see grab).        
	According to an airport official, Sutapa had arrived from Singapore, a swine flu-affected country, and was running a fever. Sutapa, husband Debesh, a senior official of a nationalised bank, and their two children landed at the airport at 10.35pm. We were in the queue for the swine flu check-up when the medical personnel asked me to step aside, Sutapa recalled.        
	They recorded my temperature and said it was quite high. After half an hour, a doctor examined me but could not find any rash or any other symptom of swine flu. He said the authorities would discuss my case.        
	Around midnight, Sutapa was informed that she would be taken to the Beleghata hospital. I was forced into an ambulance. My family members followed me in a car, she said.        
	On reaching the hospital, the doctor accompanying her went to the emergency department and asked her to proceed to the isolation ward.        
	The very thought of spending the night at the hospital made me nervous. I was sweating and asked the doctor if I at all needed to go to the ward. He said my blood samples would be collected on Monday and sent to Delhi for swine flu tests, she said.        
	When Sutapa, along with her family members, reached the isolation ward, they found the door locked from outside. A while later, two nurses opened the door, took them inside and recorded Sutapas temperature.        
	They told me there were no symptoms of flu and that doctors at the airport were unnecessarily sending people there. A doctor turned up but refused to examine me saying he was from a different department, Sutapa said.        
	After the nurses turned down her plea to sign the risk bond and leave, Sutapa, in consultation with her family, decided to walk out.

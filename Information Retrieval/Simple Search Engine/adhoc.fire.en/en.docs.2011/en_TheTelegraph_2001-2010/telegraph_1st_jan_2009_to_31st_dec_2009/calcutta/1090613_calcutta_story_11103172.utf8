                                                                                                               Jewellers at minister door
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A team representing the Swarna Shilpa Bachao Committee and the Bangiya Swarna Shilpi Samity met Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee with a list of demands in New Delhi on Thursday.        
	The two organisations had called a 72-hour jewellers strike in Calcutta to protest the alleged atrocities committed by income tax officials on jewellery shop-owners.         
	A national jewellers organisation presented the minister with suggestions for the upcoming budget at the meeting.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Election omission
                                                                                                               Election omission
                              A plastic banner for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls. A Telegraph picture                            
	Bengal may be a climate change hotspot but political parties are hardly bothered.        
	There are few mentions of environment  not to talk about climate change  in manifestos of political parties, both national and local.        
	A panel discussion in Calcutta, organised by the city-based Environment Governed Integrated Organisation and Sabujer Avijan of Chandernagore, addressed the issue.        
	A survey was carried out among the participants, including more than a hundred experts, academicians, students and government officials. Of them, 68 per cent felt that political parties do not practise what they preach in manifestoes while 84 per cent thought that political parties only talk about environmental matters to get mileage.        
	Political leaders admitted that environment remains a peripheral issue  and that they themselves do not attach much importance to manifestos. Who reads the manifestos? asked BJP leader Tathagata Roy. Lots of things are written in manifestos but hardly being given importance, agreed Manoj Bhattacharya of the RSP.         
	All major parties in the state have allotted around one-third of a page to one page to climate and other green issues in manifestos that run into numerous pages.        
	The CPM has promised to take steps to control emission of greenhouse gases through energy efficient technologies and effective regulation apart from promoting solar and non-conventional energy sources. It talks about making the process of obtaining an environmental clearance more transparent; checking pollution in rivers and water bodies; and implementing the Coastal Zone Regulation Act and saving the wetlands.        
	Its main opposition in the state, Trinamul Congress, has talked about promoting alternate energy; conserving wetlands; saving ground water; stopping unplanned urbanisation and managing rivers.         
	Trinamuls ally, the Congress, has harped on executing the national climate policy and also focused on Ganga Basin Authority.        
	Though the BJP manifesto is yet to come out, its vision document in 2004 was hardly encouraging. According to Tathagata Roy, the 2009 manifesto will be on similar lines.         
	None of the parties mention urban air pollution control; ecofriendly public transport and controlling of industrial emission, especially those from the thermal power and sponge iron industries in state, though these are extremely important issues.        
	Clearly our political system is yet to understand the far reaching impact of high carbon economy, said economist and former state pollution control board chairman Debkumar Bose.         
	Experts were also surprised that that no party mentions the climate change impact on the Sunderbans, while the rest of the world is talking about it.        
	The double speak is quite apparent. Everybody has talked about the wetlands but they continue to be encroached, said environmentalist Subhas Dutta.                     JAYANTA BASU

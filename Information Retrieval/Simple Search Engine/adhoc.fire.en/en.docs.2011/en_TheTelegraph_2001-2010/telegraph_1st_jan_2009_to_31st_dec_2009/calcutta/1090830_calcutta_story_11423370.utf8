										      stage                        Natyashastra once inspired many forms of performance and visual art, but is now referred to only by dancers, rued Gupt				                           
	Trying to get Bharatmunis Natyashastra the reverence and attention it deserves was Bharat Gupt, an associate professor at the University of Delhi, who was in the city to deliver a series of lectures on the dramatic theories of Bharata and Aristotle at St Xaviers College (August 20-22).         
	Instead of an institute devoted to its study, ancient Indian dramaturgy has only a few courses devoted to it at some theatre schools, said Gupt.         
	Few are aware of Natyashastras influence on Western thought since the 1930s when translations became available. Western performers and theorists like Howard Gardner (known for his theory of Multiple Intelligences) never acknowledged their source, said Gupt, but others like Peter Brook did. Ironically it took visits by Grotowski, Schechner, Eugenio Barba and a host of other European researchers for Indians to look up traditional and folk genres like Kudiyattam and Yakshagana.         
	Natyashastra is hardly an outdated rigid set of rules, said Gupt. In fact the last stanza welcomes additions of new concepts and interpretations. It offers interesting ideas and alternative techniques one can explore, like dhruvagaan  songs sung before the entry of characters to describe them and set the mood to guide the audience  or sthita pathya  a technique of delivering dialogues and making gestures while remaining seated on the ground.         
	After all the 10 well-practised dramatic genres, including Natak (romantic play involving kings and queens), Samavakaara (depicting wars between gods and demons) and Veethi (a set of jokes and witticism) that India had, doubled in medieval times. So there is something to suit everyone, concluded Gupt.

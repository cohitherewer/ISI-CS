The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Ticket room in Writers singed
                                                                                                               Ticket room in Writers singed
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A fire broke out on Thursday evening on the ground floor of Block G at Writers Buildings, which houses the office of the sports and youth affairs department. No one was injured.         
	The fire was detected at 5.10pm in a storeroom where tickets of the premier division matches of the Calcutta Football League and some cultural events were kept.         
	Two fire-tenders reached after the employees had put out the flames. Some papers were burnt but the tickets, which were stored in steel almirahs, were untouched.        
	We will carry out forensic tests to ascertain the cause of the fire. But it appears that a short-circuit led to the fire, said Gopal Bhattacharya, the director of fire services.         
	Sukhdeb Chatterjee, the technical assistant-in-charge of the sports department, who was in an adjacent room when the fire broke out, said that it was sheer luck that the fire was detected early.        
	Bank drafts and cash, together worth around Rs 80,000, and more tickets that were kept in the next room could have been damaged too, he added.        
	The last major fire at Writers was in August 2008, when offices of refugee rehabilitation, fire and municipal affairs departments bore the brunt.

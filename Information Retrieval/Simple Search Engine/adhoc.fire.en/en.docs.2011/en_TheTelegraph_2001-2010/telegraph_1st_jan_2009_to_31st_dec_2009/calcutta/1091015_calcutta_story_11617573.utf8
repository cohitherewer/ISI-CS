The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Poll fireworks fear on campus
                                                                                                               Poll fireworks fear on campus

	College principals in the city are bracing for a blast of the political kind on campus after Diwali.        
	With college elections scheduled to be held in November and December against the backdrop of escalating political rivalry, the principals have decided to jointly petition Calcutta University for special measures to keep the acrimony from invading the campus.        
	Student elections this year are likely to be volatile given the present political scenario. We need to take some additional measures to ensure that our institutions run smoothly when they reopen after the vacation, Anjan Sengupta, the general secretary of the West Bengal Principals Council, told Metro.        
	The Trinamul Congress Chhatra Parishad and the Congress-backed Chhatra Parishad are desperate to wrest control of the student unions run by the Left-affiliated Students Federation of India (SFI).         
	A potentially explosive situation is staring us in the face. We will need all the help we can get from the university to maintain order on campus, said Sengupta.        
	Of the 108 colleges under Calcutta University, elections are due in 85 institutions over the next two months. The SFI holds the reins of 70 of the 85 unions that will go to poll.        
	Vice-chancellor Suranjan Das said he would like the principals to be careful without being overly intrusive.        
	We advise the college heads not to stir the pot in the event of any controversy pertaining to the elections. We also request our students to maintain discipline on campus and not be instigated by political parties, Das added.         
	Clashes between rival unions have been reported from several colleges since the CPMs debacle in the Lok Sabha elections.        
	The institutions where classes have been disrupted and property damaged over the past six months include Sarsuna College, Diamond Harbour College, Khudiram Bose Central College, St Pauls College, Sammilani College, Girish Chandra Basu College (Bangabasi College of Commerce), New Alipore College and Gourmohan Sashimohan College.        
	State SFI secretary Koustav Chatterjee, however, claimed that his organisation had managed to keep things under control over the past few years.        
	Colleges had become dens of criminal elements during the early Seventies. The SFI restored the academic atmosphere in every college where it was voted to the student union, he said.        
	Koustav warned the Congress and the Trinamul-backed unions against trying to capture the college unions with the help of local goons.         
	Baishanar Chatterjee, the state president of the Trinamul Congress Chattra Parishad, said his group was confident of ousting the SFI after years of being dominated.        
	The SFI has been able to win student elections year after year by adopting unfair means in connivance with the college authorities. They (SFI) prevent candidates owing allegiance to the Trinamul from filing nominations and voting. We wont tolerate such arm-twisting this time, said Baishanar.        
	The Trinamuls student wing intends squatting in front of colleges and laying siege to police stations if the elections are not held in a free and fair manner.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Old river choked by rail
                                                                                                               Old river choked by rail

	Should Metro Railway pay compensation to Calcutta for irreversibly impacting the Adi Ganga channel, damaging its drainage potential and thus putting the city at risk?         
	The 8.5km long Tollygunge-Garia Metro stretch is soon to be laid over the Adi Ganga. Concrete pillars to support the rails are being constructed on the riverbed.         
	The Ganga had originally branched into three streams at Tribeni  Saraswati, the upstream branch, Jamuna, the downstream branch and Hooghly, which flowed in the middle. The Hooghly flowed down the area where Calcutta now stands. This course of the Hooghly is known as Adi Ganga.         
	Subsequently the Hooghly abandoned the Adi Ganga channel and adopted the lower course of the Saraswati, narrowing the Adi Ganga.        
	The Adi Ganga was the major drainage basin of the city, especially for the southern parts. The river was navigable till the 19th century with William Tolly connecting the Adi Ganga channel to the Vidyadhari in 1775. Now it is a mere khal. At many places the course has been encroached upon and even dried up.         
	The construction of Metro rail is expected to enhance the siltation and may prove to be its death knell.        
	Recently a number of environment experts met in the city and demanded that the original course of Ganga be restored and Metro Railway compensate the city.         
	When the plan was being made we repeatedly took up the issue with the Metro authorities but they hardly responded, alleged Asit Roy, who has undertaken a detailed research on Adi Ganga with the late Rebati Ranjan Bhattacharjee, an activist.         
	With Adi Ganga almost choked, a flood-like situation may result. Already stretches in the citys southern part remain waterlogged for long periods during monsoon.         
	The Adi Ganga would play an important role in draining out the storm-water, which has been affected with hundreds of pillars being constructed, said Tapas Ghatak of the CMDA environment cell. Mohit Roy, who fought a legal battle against the project, cited the Cheonggye river project in Seoul, which had to be dug out and rejuvenated in 2001-02. A six-lane flyover was demolished in the process.

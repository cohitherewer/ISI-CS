                A fire broke out in a two-storeyed house in Ajaynagar late on Saturday. Police said the owner had stacked a large quantity of katatel on the ground floor following raids on stalls selling the toxic fuel. Two tenders took an hour to bring the blaze under control. Fire brigade officers said the stacked fuel might have caused the blaze. The owner is absconding. No one was injured. The house has been partially gutted and a couple of adjacent huts, too, have been burnt.    Ashok Todi, the prime accused in the Rizwanur Rehman death case, was admitted to ILS Hospital in Salt Lake late on Saturday after he got bail on Friday. Doctors at the ILS Hospital said he was stable. Ashoks brother Pradip, who was also granted bail the same day, was released from Presidency jail on Sunday morning. Officials said the bail papers came late.    Five youths were arrested from Rajchandrapur, in Howrah, on Sunday morning in connection with several highway robberies in the past two years. A country-made revolver, a razor and a knife were seized from them. All five were remanded in police custody for three days.    A fire broke out in a footwear store in Behalas Pathakpara on Sunday morning, injuring Han Sang Chung, the proprietor, an employee and a fire brigade official. Three tenders took more than two hours to bring the blaze under control. The injured were taken to Vidyasagar Hospital, where two of them were admitted. Fire brigade official Tapan Nag was discharged after treatment. Officials said the store lacked fire-fighting measures and that a short-circuit might have caused the blaze.    Ratan Biswas, 19, was arrested on Saturday night in connection with three robberies in Barasat and Madhyamgram last month. Earlier in the day, cops arrested five youths, including three Higher Secondary examinees, on similar charges. Five of the six youths were remanded in judicial custody and the sixth in police custody.

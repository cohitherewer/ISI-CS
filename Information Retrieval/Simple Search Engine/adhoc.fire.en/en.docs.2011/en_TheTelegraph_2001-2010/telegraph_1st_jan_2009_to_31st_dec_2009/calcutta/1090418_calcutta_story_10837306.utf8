  - Taiwan comes calling          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Taiwan has come calling with multiple offers for tourists in Calcutta and to explore investment opportunities.        
	We offer a very attractive alternative to favourite stops like Singapore, Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur, more so for Calcutta, because of its geographical proximity, Wenchyi Ong, representative, Taipei Economic and Cultural Centre in New Delhi, said on Friday.        
	Effective from March 1, the Taiwan government has waived visa requirement for any Indian traveller holding a visa for Japan, New Zealand, Australia, the US, the UK, Canada or any Schengen country.         
	Taiwan issued less than 2,000 visas to Indians last year and the target for next year is 5,000.        
	Ong was in the city on a brand-building exercise and stressed the islands renewed thrust on increasing tourist traffic from India, while also engaging the business community in dialogue to identify potential areas of concord.        
	Taiwan is less than six hours from Calcutta if one flies via Bangkok, and the entire 36,200-sq km island is a shopping paradise, he said.        
	The embassy, in tie-up with a private tour operator, is formulating Taiwan packages aimed at the Calcutta tourist, with a guided tour of the iconic National Palace Museum, housing 6.5 lakh pieces of Chinese artefacts.        
	The ambassador, who also met representatives of the Calcutta Chamber of Commerce, plans to invite a business delegation from the city to Taiwan in June and will set up a trade promotion office in Calcutta in September, the third such after Mumbai and Chennai. By the year-end, a Taiwanese trade delegation representing around 25 companies should be in town.        
	Its a shame that Indian people know so little about Taiwan and we would like to correct that by raising awareness through people-to-people exchanges, which would automatically lead to business ties, the diplomat said.        
	Taiwan has a $5.3-billion trade volume with India at the moment and a $1.2-billion investment in this country. Most of it is concentrated in Tamil Nadu, while Gujarat is fast catching up.        
	While the chambers have identified food-processing and medical equipment as two core areas where Taiwan can contribute, the manufacturing island, which makes everything from shoes to computer chips for top MNCs, is confident it can offer 90 per cent of what Bengal needs.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Varsity plan to share test load
                                                                                                               Varsity plan to share test load
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	The undergraduate council of Calcutta University on Monday drafted a plan to empower colleges to conduct undergraduate examinations in compulsory subjects such as environmental education, compulsory additional English and compulsory additional Bengali.        
	The move is an attempt at reducing the universitys examination-related load.        
	According to the proposal, colleges affiliated to the university will conduct the examinations on their premises and get the answer scripts evaluated by their teachers in the respective subjects. The university, however, will set the question papers and send them to the colleges.        
	The colleges will then have to send the marks to the university for preparation of results, states the proposal.        
	Enrolment in undergraduate courses is rising every year with a steady increase in the success rate in the board exams. Undergraduate courses in emerging subjects are also being introduced every year. We need to decentralise the functioning of the university to ensure timely publication of results, said a member of the undergraduate council.        
	Since all the examinees are required to write the environmental educational and compulsory additional papers, the university struggles to cope with such a huge number of answer scripts. The proposed system will cut down the universitys workload. But we can implement it only after taking the views of teachers, said Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee, the CU pro vice-chancellor (academic).        
	All BA, BSc and BCom examinations are currently conducted by the universitys controller of examinations department.        
	Students must obtain pass marks in the environmental education and one compulsory additional language paper  both with full marks 50 and taught in Part I under the 1+1+1 pattern  to become graduates.        
	Marks obtained in the two subjects however are not used to determine the overall performance of the examinees.

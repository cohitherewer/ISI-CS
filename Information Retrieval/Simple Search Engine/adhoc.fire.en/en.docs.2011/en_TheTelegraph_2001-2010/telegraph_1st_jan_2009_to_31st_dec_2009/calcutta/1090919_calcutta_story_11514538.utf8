The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fire brigade notice to errant pujas 
                                                                                                               Fire brigade notice to errant pujas 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The fire department on Friday slapped notices on several puja committees across town for their alleged violation of rules set by the government and approved by the high court.        
	The errant organisers were asked to comply with the order within five days.        
	Among the north Calcutta pujas the fire brigade teams visited was Rammohan Roy Road Sarbojonin Durgotsav, where straw was used as a key decorative material.        
	The court has ruled that straw, being a combustible material, cannot be used in pandals. We also came across some violations at Chaltabagan and Brindaban Matri Mandir, said Tushar Sen, a fire department official.        
	In south, firemen issued rectification orders to Badamtala Ashar Sangha and Shibmandir.         
	Our teams will keep revisiting the pandals to check whether all the guidelines were being followed, said D.P. Biswas, the additional director-general in the fire services department.        
	An officer of Lake police station said: Several pandals are touching the boundary walls of adjacent houses. We are asking the organisers to trim the structures.

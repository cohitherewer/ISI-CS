The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A tsunami or a blip
                                                                                                               A tsunami or a blip
  - How will future generations look at the economic meltdown?

	As world leaders from the G-20 countries met in London this week to solve the financial mess we are in, I wondered what kind of impact this recession would have on the generations to come. Will we remember this as one of the darkest phases in history, or will it just be another small blip in a sea of many adversities?         
	The world is interconnected today and thats a good thing. Grandparents watch on Yahoo messenger as their grandchild eats his first morsel of solid food, lovers talk all night on Skype and model UN students from high schools across the world discuss global matters on Facebook. But inter-connectedness comes with its price, it makes us interdependent. Something that happens in China can have an impact in the US and something that happens in the US has a real effect in India, whether it is less foreign investment or more lay-offs in the call centres working for American businesses.        
	In New York, even though its spring, the signs of dismay are too hard to ignore (AFP picture above). Right from what dominates the news on the airwaves or the grocery stores advertising fresh produce, inducing consumers to cook at home rather than go out, to the houses in my town being foreclosed because of mortgage defaults, the recession has certainly hit home. Social security nets are disappearing. Retirement savings of many elderly have vanished with the stock market, adult children who have been laid- off are moving back home with their ageing parents and college graduates, education loans in tow, are pondering their next move with no jobs on the horizon. What kind of impact I wonder will this have on the young generation; will this not define them in some indelible way?         
	Taking risks is an intrinsic American characteristic. Its a quintessential attribute that allows start-ups with the most modest beginnings  Google started in a garage  to flourish, just as it gives many the courage to go for a new degree or quit an unhappy job, or walk away from an abusive marriage knowing they will still be okay. Risk taking is also the fuel behind the perpetual drive in Americans to innovate, key to this nations rise over the last century. But when a financial tsunami like the present one hits, and banks stop lending, people lose jobs, their homes, and their livelihoods, will it leave with this core American value changed?         
	Whether in the US or in Iceland  a small European nation whose banks made such risky bets that it forced the country into bankruptcy  beliefs changed within this generation. It is easy to take economic times for granted, live it almost with a sense of entitlement. While the economy is booming and jobs with sky-high salaries relatively easy to come by, we effortlessly let go of what for many of us used to be a strong and intrinsic value  that of living within ones means. We moved seamlessly into a life where buying bigger houses than we could afford, taking foreign holidays charged to credit cards, and driving around on narrow roads in giant SUVs became an unquestionable reality. Perhaps we thought it was permanent and sustainable.        
	So, what will be the final takeaway from this economic crisis? Will we become frugal like the survivors of the Great Depression did in the years that followed? Maybe we will, but many will argue every cloud has a silver lining, and after every financial upheaval comes the recovery such as the remarkable phase of risk taking and private enterprise that America saw after World War II. So when the pendulum swings the other way, how much would we have changed? Or is it intrinsic human nature to see events such as these only as small blips and carry on like nothing really happened?

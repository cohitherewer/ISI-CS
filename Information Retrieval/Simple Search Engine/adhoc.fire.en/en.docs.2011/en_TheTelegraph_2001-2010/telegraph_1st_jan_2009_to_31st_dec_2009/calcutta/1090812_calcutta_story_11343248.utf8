                      Life and loneliness                    Poetry and painting each seeks to attain the aesthetic essence of the other. And the metaphor that best describes the paintings of Jayasmita Chatterjee is visual poetry. The 15 works on display at the ongoing solo show of her works, Kabita, are poetic expressions of the world as perceived through the eyes of the artist. The colours and words she has used try to put into perspective our understanding of the status of the self in the current historical setting, and thus addresses one of the most critical questions of identity in the modern world. The central theme of her paintings is, however, urban loneliness and the decadence of society. Working with a simple, yet unique style, she explores her subjects with wit, satire and empathy. Done in watercolour and computer graphics on rice paper, using subtle colours and compositions, her works provide an interesting insight into life and its ironies.                  Event: An exhibition of paintings by Jayasmita Chatterjee When: Till August 15; 12 noon - 8 pm Where: The Art Walk, Emami Chisel Art, South City Mall, 375 Prince Anwar Shah Road

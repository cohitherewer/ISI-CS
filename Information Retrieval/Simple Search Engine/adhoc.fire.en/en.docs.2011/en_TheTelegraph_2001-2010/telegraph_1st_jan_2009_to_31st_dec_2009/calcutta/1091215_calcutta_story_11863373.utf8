The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Storm steals city winter 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Storm steals city winter 
          MEGHDEEP BHATTACHARYYA                                    
	A storm off the Tamil Nadu coast is to be blamed for Calcuttas elusive winter.        
	Cyclone Ward, which has turned into a deep depression after losing much of its strength, has helped create enough moisture over the Bay of Bengal to belie the weathermans prediction that the mercury would plunge below 13 degrees Celsius in south Bengal by mid-December.         
	The citys minimum temperature on Monday was 16.6 degrees Celsius, three degrees above normal, while the maximum humidity was as high as 99 per cent.        
	Ward has done to Calcutta in December what Cyclone Phyan did last month. Phyan struck the western coast in mid-November and in the chain effect, the minimum temperature in the city shot up to 26.7 degrees Celsius, eight degrees above normal, said an independent watcher.        
	The mercury has been rising steadily since Friday  when the city last experienced a normal minimum temperature  keeping pace with the storm.        
	The city and its neighbourhood are experiencing an indirect impact of Cyclone Ward, which has weakened into a deep depression and is hovering over the southwest Bay on Monday morning. The moisture it has generated over the sea is entering south Bengal and blocking the winter current, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.         
	An official in Delhis India Meteorological Department said the moisture was preventing the heat from escaping and resulting in mist or fog in the morning.        
	The relatively warm wind from the Bay of Bengal is also preventing cooler northwesterlies from blowing across south Bengal. Add to it a feeble western disturbance, you have the perfect condition for a warm winter, Debnath told Metro.        
	The current phenomenon is likely to last for at least three more days. Till then, there is no chance of the minimum temperature dropping below the 13-degree mark and Calcuttans enjoying the usual December chill, said a senior scientist at the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF), Noida.        
	Things are likely to get cooler after December 21. The western disturbances should intensify in a week or so. By that time the deep depression in the south will weaken further, clearing the way for free flow of northwesterlies over south Bengal, said an official in the Noida centre.        
	Tuesday is likely to be foggy in the morning, with temperatures ranging between 16 and 28 degrees Celsius.

                      Aesthetic impressions by young artists                    Six alumni of Rabindra Bharati University come together with their works in Young Bengal, the ongoing exhibition of paintings, drawings and graphics. Uncluttered, their works speak about their childhood experiences, the life around them, their fantasies and changing social norms. Amit Manna depicts how human vices like greed and selfishness lead to self-destruction. Ankan Chakrabortys etchings try to seek out beauty from the unconventional beauty of his subjects  animals, birds and nature. Nature is also the subject of Anirban Khamarus graphic creations through which he attempts to portray the conflict between nature and man-made objects. Satavisha Hazras (a painting by the artist appears here) works, focussing on inanimate objects, reflect the artists sense of alienation from the materialistic world. Essentially figurative, the works of Anjan Modak and Soma Das capture nuances of everyday life. Modak flashbacks to his carefree childhood days as if to derive comfort from his memories, even as he grapples with the complexities of contemporary life. Das, on the other hand, delicately portrays everyday life, be it on the streets, in the classroom, in her neighbourhood or at the railway station, using a miniature styling by which she has been deeply influenced.

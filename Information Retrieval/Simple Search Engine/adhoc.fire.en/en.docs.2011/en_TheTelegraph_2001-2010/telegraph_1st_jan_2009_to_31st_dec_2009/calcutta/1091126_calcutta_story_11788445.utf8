	Late to bed and early to rise is leaving schoolchildren in the city unhealthy, inattentive and anything but wise.        
	Nothing registers in my brain during the first three classes of the day. I long to get back home and catch up on sleep for at least an hour, admits Class XII student Taran Veer Singh, who stays awake till well after midnight and wakes up to the alarm ringing at 6 in the morning.        
	Sleep deprivation in children takes its toll in the form of lapses in concentration, absenteeism in school and health problems ranging from fatigue and indigestion to migraine and ulcers.        
	My son feels lethargic all the time and needs regular medication for indigestion, says Manmeet Kaur, the mother of a Class XII student who studies till late every night.        
	Not every child sacrifices sleep for study, though.        
	The nocturnal life of a student from Class VIII upwards is as much about social networking over the phone or on the Net as about studies. Those hours of privacy seem to matter to them more than sleep, says a researcher studying student behaviour.        
	The parents of a Class VIII student of a reputable south Calcutta school are spending lakhs to transfer their daughter to a strict boarding school in Bangalore so that she is cured of her habit of staying up all night to speak to friends over the phone or chat online.        
	Meghna Mukherjee (name changed), a Class IX student, admits to feeling drowsy in class but wont change her habit of staying up late because that would mean sacrificing her nocturnal networking time. Night (call) rates are cheaper, giggles Meghna.        
	Nupur Ghosh, the mother of a Class X student at St Xaviers Collegiate School, is worried that her son texts his friends even when he is studying. I cant even scold him. Lack of sleep has made him prone to temper tantrums.        
	When schools report a drop in academic performance in children, the culprit often turns out to be sleep deprivation. I have seen children dozing off while writing an exam. No matter how good a child is in studies, performance suffers if he or she doesnt get enough sleep, explains Apeejay School principal Rita Chatterjee.         
	Nandita Pal Choudhury, whose daughters are in classes X and XII at La Martiniere for Girls, tries to dissuade both from studying late into the night but they dont listen. On several occasions, my daughters have come back from an exam upset that they couldnt recall everything they had learnt, says Nandita.        
	Some schools have begun counselling students about the advantages of following a healthy routine. We have also been discussing possible remedial measures at parent-teacher meetings. We suggest that parents dont allow their children to use cellphones or computers after 11pm, says Fr Siby Joseph, the principal of Don Bosco School, Park Circus.        
	Communication between parents and children is the key to understanding and solving sleep problems, stresses Malini Bhagat, the principal of Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School. Students pass out in class for lack of sleep. Its that serious.        
	Doctors recommend eight to nine hours of sleep for children. Compromising on sleep leads to inconsistent performance, behavioural disorders and also delayed response. In the long run, the heart becomes weak, warns Apurba Ghosh, the director of the Institute of Child Health.

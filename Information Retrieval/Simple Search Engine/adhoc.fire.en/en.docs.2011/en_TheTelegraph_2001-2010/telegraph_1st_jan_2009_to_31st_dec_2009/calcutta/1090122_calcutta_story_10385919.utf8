          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Rabindra Bharati Universitys BT Road campus will next month become the first institution to start a performing arts therapy course approved by the University Grants Commission (UGC).        
	Doctors and NGOs already use music and dance to treat those suffering from pain, stress, depression and lack of self-respect. But now we have a structured course, complete with professional training in physiotherapy and psychology, that will help them do the same job better, said Kathak danseuse Amita Dutt, the dean of fine arts.         
	Arpita Chatterjee, the course co-ordinator, said the UGC had sounded out the university last year for some new job-oriented courses. We had suggested a couple of courses to them, of which performing arts therapy was selected for financial aid.         
	Classes will be conducted in the evening. We will begin with a certificate course and later introduce a two-year diploma course and a three-year advanced diploma course, Dutt said.         
	Students hoping to enrol for the course will have to be proficient in either singing, dancing or drama.        
	Debdulal Dutta Roy of the Indian Statistical Institutes psychology research unit said performing arts could become one of the best tools to ease pain.         
	With knowledge and practice, one can perfect the art of assessing what kind of music or art form would best alleviate the physical and psychological problems or ailments of a particular patient, said Dutta Roy, who will teach psychology and psychiatry as part of the course.        
	Orthopaedist Sumanta Thakur, who will teach physiotherapy to the first class of 40 certificate-course students, has long been using music therapy to put his patients at ease during and after surgery. According to him, performing arts therapy can be particularly beneficial to autistic children.

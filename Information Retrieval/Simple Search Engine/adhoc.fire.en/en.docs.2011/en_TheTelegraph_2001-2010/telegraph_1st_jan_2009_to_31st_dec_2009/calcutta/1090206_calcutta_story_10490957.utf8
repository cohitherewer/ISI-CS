  - Order binding on all exam agencies        OUR LEGAL REPORTER                                                  
	Students have the right to take a look at their answer scripts if they are dissatisfied with their marks in major examinations.        
	A division bench of Calcutta High Court on Thursday went by the judgment of Justice Sanjib Banerjee of the same court and held that agencies conducting exams are bound to show the answer script if an examinee demands it under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005.        
	All agencies from Calcutta University to ICSE/CBSE and various school authorities will come under the purview of the order.        
	The division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice Dipankar Dutta in their 50-page ruling said: The examination conducting agencies will have to show the answer scripts to the candidates within four weeks of their filing the application under Right to Information Act.        
	If the examinees find any fault in the evaluation of their answer scripts and want a review of the same, the examination conducting authorities will have to review the scripts and inform the result to the examinee concerned in accordance with their respective norms.        
	According to rough estimates, about 4 lakh students from the state appear for the Higher Secondary examinations, around 8 lakh for Madhyamik, around 40,000-45,000 for CBSE and ICSE each year. More than one lakh students appear for exams conducted by 11 universities in the state.        
	Once the ruling comes into effect  when a certified copy of the order reaches the examination conducting agencies  allowing dissatisfied examinees a look at the answer scripts becomes mandatory.        
	According to Article 19 of the Constitution, examinees must have access to evaluated answer scripts.... Denial of inspection of answer scripts means the constitutional right to express and information may be lost, the division bench observed, upholding Justice Banerjees verdict.        
	The ruling followed an appeal by Calcutta University against Justice Banerjees order and five other writ petitions, three by the Madhyamik board. The appeal and petitions were heard by the division bench analogously.        
	Early last year, a Part II student of mathematics honours in Presidency College, Pritam Rooz, had moved a writ before Justice Banerjee against Calcutta Universitys decision not to show him an answer script.        
	Appearing for Rooz, his counsel had claimed that following the enactment of the RTI Act, the university authorities were bound to show the answer script to his client.        
	Justice Banerjee, on March 28, 2008, had allowed Roozs petition and asked the university authorities to show him the answer script.        
	Armed with Justice Banerjees judgment, many Madhyamik 2008 examinees had approached the RTI commission seeking an order demanding a look at their answer scripts.        
	When the RTI commission had asked the board of secondary education to show the answer scripts to the aggrieved students, it had moved a writ petition before the high court against the commissions order.        
	Since 2002, more than hundred students appearing for the Higher Secondary and Madhyamik exams have approached the high court every year with complaints against their marks in certain papers.        
	In 2003, more than 300 Higher Secondary candidates had moved a PIL in the high court demanding an order for the council to show them their answer scripts. The division bench, after hearing the PIL, had asked the council to make its result publication process transparent.

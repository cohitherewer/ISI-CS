The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cool comfort for Metro commuter   Extra cover for stations
                                                                                                               Cool comfort for Metro commuter   Extra cover for stations
  - Puja 2009 tube tryst with 13 new rakes and extended run till New Garia          TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                                                  
	Metro Railway commuters will travel in the comfort of air-conditioned coaches earliest by June and latest by Puja.        
	To add to the cheer, the authorities have announced that trains would start running on the extended route, till Birji, from June.        
	Birji is 1.5km from the terminal station, New Garia, which is likely to be commissioned in September, said a Metro Railway official. The entire extended route from Tollygunge stretches 8.6km.        
	Metro Rail has decided to procure 13 air-conditioned rakes that will ply the entire route between Dum Dum and Birji to begin with and then to New Garia. Two of them are expected to arrive by June 2009 and the rest in September.        
	The new rakes will have higher speed air suspension bogie system for enhanced passenger comfort. They will also emit less noise, said an official.        
	The existing trains too, he added, will be made air-conditioned in phases once the pilot project is through.        
	The authorities have also decided to revamp the signalling and ticketing system. The magnetic paper ticket system will be replaced by a smart token system. The existing stations will have another 100 smart gates and the seven stations on the extended route  Chanditala, Kudghat, Bansdroni, Naktala, Garia Bazar, Birji and New Garia  will have around 80. The smart gates will result in quicker dispersal of passengers, the official said.        
	To boost security at the stations and along the route, the Metro Railway authorities have written to the Railway Board seeking consent for their Rs 42-crore plan covering sniffer dog, bomb suits, advanced bomb detection equipment, vapour detectors, explosives detectors and X-ray scanners.        
	The security upgrade has become necessary following the recent terror strikes across the country. The number of guards will be increased from 216 to 800, aid J.K. Mitra, the chief operating manager of the Metro Railway.                                
	The Railway Protection Force and Calcutta police have assured the authorities about deploying the additional men, who will undergo special training to tackle emergency situations.        
	In the upgrade budget, around Rs 20 crore have been set aside to attach intelligent surveillance scanners to CCTVs. The scanners will set off an alarm the moment they spot an unattended object or persons loitering around for too long.        
	The CCTVs only record events now. Once upgraded, they will identify possible threats themselves and alert us, said Mitra.        
	The authorities have also proposed an increase in the number of door-frame metal detectors and hand-held metal detectors. Now, there are 80 door frame and 60 hand-held metal detectors.

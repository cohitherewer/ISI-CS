The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Top cop tips to stop snarls
                                                                                                               Top cop tips to stop snarls
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Cops handling traffic must move around constantly and monitor vehicle flow instead of staying put at a spot, police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti said at a recent meeting with all officers of the traffic department.        
	Why are there snarls even during lean periods of the day? Traffic officers have been provided with motorcycles and they must patrol their areas continuously to monitor the vehicle flow, the top cop said at the Traffic Review.        
	Last Friday evening, three persons standing on the footboard of an overcrowded private bus on route 12C/1A were crushed when the vehicle grazed another in Kidderpore. One of the trio later died.        
	While cops had slapped a case of rash and negligent driving on the absconding driver, a senior officer in the traffic department said the driver should be charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder.         
	Chakrabarti pulled up his officers for the rising number of mishaps on AJC Bose Road, Mahatma Gandhi Road and APC Road.

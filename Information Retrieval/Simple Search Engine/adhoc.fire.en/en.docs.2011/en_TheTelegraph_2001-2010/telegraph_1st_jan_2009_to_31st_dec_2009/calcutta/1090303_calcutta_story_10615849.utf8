          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Three youths who had snatched Rs 400, a gold chain, a cellphone, two gold rings and an ATM card from a 22-year-old college student in a share taxi on the EM Bypass last month were arrested on Monday.        
	Chandrabhushan Poddar, Ajoy Giri and Harish Singh were arrested from the Maniktala-Phoolbagan area. They were part of a snatching racket that usually operated at night, said an officer.        
	According to him, the girl had boarded the share taxi at AJC Bose Road-Lord Sinha Road crossing around 8pm on February 11 on the way to her Salt Lake home. Ajoy was driving the taxi while Chandrabhusan and Harish were in the rear seat.        
	They snatched the girls belongings and beat her up as the vehicle neared Paroma Island. The trio threw her off the vehicle near Lake Town.

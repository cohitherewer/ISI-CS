The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Security sham at malls, hotels
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Security sham at malls, hotels
  - Guns pass metal detectors in mock test        KINSUK BASU AND POULOMI BANERJEE                                    
	A stealth operation by Calcutta police has confirmed what we feared  that malls and star hotels around town are security sieves.        
	Teams of plainclothes policemen casually walked past guards and through beeping doorframe metal detectors with guns and knives tucked under their belts while some planted unclaimed bags in lobbies where they remained undetected for hours, busting the hotel-and-mall security myth over two days of random checks.

	The operation  conducted on November 13 and 16  also revealed that most of these high-footfall addresses do not have personnel trained to read and respond to a beeping doorframe metal detector or even a basic system to monitor closed-circuit television footage.        
	The police have shot off letters to the management of these malls and hotels, summoning them for a comprehensive review of what went wrong and why.        
	We have told them to get their act together, the deputy commissioner of police (central), Tripurari, told Metro.        
	The operation was so hush-hush that even the officers-in-charge of the police stations under whose jurisdiction these malls and hotels operate were unaware of it. Ten teams comprising four officers each from different units carried out the security scan.        
	Ranjit Panchnanda, the special commissioner of police in charge of security, refused comment, but sources confirmed the operation.        
	We visited the malls and hotels in the evening, when footfalls are the highest. There were glaring security lapses everywhere, said an officer.         
	Guards deployed at the malls and hotels didnt frisk the plainclothes personnel at any of the three shop stops and three star hotels that failed the test.        
	At some places, police officers walking in with knives and guns were not stopped even after the doorframe metal detector had beeped loud and clear, signalling a security breach.        
	Ashit Luthra, whose GI Security secures several high-profile addresses, said: Security staff in most malls, hotels and multiplexes have only basic training in guarding and cannot be expected to be experts in terror management. Security is actually everybodys responsibility, and public awareness training is very important.        
	The security lapses were blamed on a multiplicity of factors ranging from rush hour to human error.        
	A spokesperson for the Future Group, which owns the Pantaloons chain, cited rush-hour distractions for not intercepting armed plainclothes policemen at the Gariahat store. We admit they should have been frisked but its an omission that I think all malls and stores would be guilty of during rush hour.         
	Forum, on Elgin Road, faced three checks in two days, said an official. Twice our performance was satisfactory; we were partially successful the third time. The cops put a bag near a baggage display. A security officer saw it but thought it was part of the display.        
	At Mani Square on the EM Bypass, the guards on duty claimed to have not stopped the plainclothes police officers because they recognised them. We were later told that a police officer should be checked like any other person. We will be more vigilant now, said a mall official.        
	Diya Basu at The Park said no security system could be 100 per cent fail-safe. We are equipped with the best-in-class security systems, but human error can creep in.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Roller coaster called work 
                                                                                                               Roller coaster called work

	Its summer in New York: sunny beaches, short clothes and bright days. When summers here, can vacations be far behind? Its a nice daydream that helps us get through the 40-50 hour work-week that is often the norm in the US. Work hard and play harder  was the popular mantra of my generation. But somewhere along the way, have we forgotten that working hard was meant to be a means to the end and not the end itself?        
	Compared to the two weeks that US firms usually give as annual leave, most Europeans get five to six weeks, on top of a 35-hour work week. But to even imagine six weeks of paid leave is impossible for a majority of Americans.        
	Many of Manhattans parks (Central Park in picture top) come alive in summer. As I walk to my office, I see the dog walkers, the nannies with strollers, the tourists and the students sitting on the park benches soaking in the sun.         
	Shakespeare in the Park  a series of theatre performances by Broadway stars is presented for free during the hot summer months. So are concerts, dance recitals, crafts festivals and over 600 free classes like Yoga and Tai Chi. But where is the time to enjoy all these for anyone who works?        
	Surrounded by uninterrupted connections through Blackberry, iPhone and laptops, lives of those who are employed have changed dramatically in the last decade. Work carries over much beyond the office, along with all the hours that go in preparing for a routine event-free work-week. From getting work clothes ready, or making sure the children are taken care of while you work, or even the hours spent in office commute, all seems to add up to many extra hours of work. Its as if we are on a relentless roller coaster that starts and ends at the same spot  our work.        
	Many say they work hard, for they are in a hurry. They are in a rush to get it all done  to make a name, make money and savings  so that they can retire at 50 and enjoy life. Travel books are bought and adventures get planned. But do they really happen? Does one really give up a job and the dependable income that comes with it when one still has many productive work years left? More often than not, that magic age of retirement keeps getting postponed to another day. And so does leisure in the midst of long work days.        
	It is hard enough to get off the roller coaster once it becomes a habit. But it can be near impossible, especially in times of economic crisis. Many feel they can no longer negotiate with employers for longer annual leave. With unemployment rate touching a 26-year high this June, Americans are now willing to make even more concessions for their jobs. A recent survey found that 64 per cent of employees are willing to work longer hours and 71 per cent are happy to take on more projects and responsibilities if it gives more stability  all adding up to more hours at the office desk.         
	Like every year, American summer brings in Indian parents. And they have already started arriving  I see them in their walking shoes and salwar kameezes taking a stroll or sitting on the park bench. But how do they spend their day I wonder, for the people they have come to visit are never home. Growing up, we were told, get an education, so that you can get a job, so that you can lead a happy and balanced life. I guess these long work days, instant email and long commutes are a sign of progress, of personal achievement, but seeing the toddlers chasing after butterflies as I walk past Bryant Park on my way to work, I wonder if we have forgotten why we are doing what we are doing in the first place.

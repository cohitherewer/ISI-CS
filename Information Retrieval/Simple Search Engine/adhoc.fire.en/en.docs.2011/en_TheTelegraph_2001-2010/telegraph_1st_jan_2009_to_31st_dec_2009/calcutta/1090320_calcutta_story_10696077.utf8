The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Jawan suicide in barracks
                                                                                                               Jawan suicide in barracks
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A jawan of the Eastern Frontier Rifles (EFR) committed suicide in Alipore early on Thursday by setting himself ablaze. Dilip Kochari, 48, was rushed to SSKM Hospital, where he was declared dead.        
	A constable of West Bengal police sustained burns while trying to save Kochari. The police said the incident took place between 5am and 5.30am in the EFR barracks on Belvedere Road.         
	Kochari came out of his barracks and went to the caretakers room. He took out kerosene from a stove and poured it on himself. He then set himself ablaze, said Jawed Shamim, the city detective chief.        
	Debabrata Bose, the constable who tried to save Kochari, said he saw the jawan in flames while taking a morning walk. He was near the canteen on the Bhawani Bhavan campus. I pushed him to the ground to put out the flames, Bose said.         
	When Kochari started screaming in pain, Bose tried roll him on the ground. But I could not hold him for more than a few seconds as the flames started singeing me, said Bose.        
	He rushed Kochari to the hospital with the help of his colleagues.        
	The police are yet to ascertain the reason behind Kocharis suicide.

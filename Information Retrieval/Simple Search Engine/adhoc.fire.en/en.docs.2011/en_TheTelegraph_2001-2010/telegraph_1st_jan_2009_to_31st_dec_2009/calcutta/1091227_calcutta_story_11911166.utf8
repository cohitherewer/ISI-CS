										      caleidoscope                        A photograph by Prabir Purkayastha and (below) the new cabin names at a popular watering hole in central Calcutta. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha				                                 
	Adman-turned-photographer Prabir Purkayastha, who is currently holding an exhibition of his photographs at the Weavers Studio Centre for the Arts, is also an avid storyteller. And the best stories, taken with a pinch of salt, are from his own life.         
	Purkayastha, who is in his late 50s, says he ran away to Thailand as a fresh graduate as much to be with the woman he loved as to escape the conventional life his father had chartered for him, became a business journalist and eventually found himself working with Rajiv Gandhi for a Congress ad campaign in 1991.         
	So impressed was he by Rajiv Gandhi that he made up his mind to join politics. But the young Prime Minister was assassinated and a friend advised a disillusioned Purkayastha to go to Ladakh. But the monks didnt allow me to join the monastery and suggested I explore the place instead, says Purkayastha.         
	Over the next few years, Purkayastha travelled across Ladakh. It was here that he started his career as a photographer and also saw the most fantastic thing.         
	I saw the Buddha weep, he says, in all seriousness. The incident, he says, happened on September 11, 2001, the day terror attacks shook the US and the world. I was in the village of Basgo, photographing the mountains. Nearby is an old and now deserted monastery with a 15ft statue of a sitting Buddha. The statue is so tall that the head of the Buddha goes through the roof. When I went up to see the face, I saw tears rolling down Buddhas cheeks, recalls Purkayastha.         
	In 2004, Purkayastha quit his advertising job and toured Assam, Ladakh and Southeast Asia with his camera. The exhibition at Weavers Studio, titled Return to Eden, is a compilation of those photographs, presented in association with Art Alive Gallery.         
	Among the exhibits are two birds  which for Pukayastha symbolise Adam and Eve. I think the fall from Eden was a good thing, because it was a release from the prison of illusions, he says. The exhibition, curated by Ina Puri, is on till January 13.         
	Whats in a name?        
	The old establishment of Chung Wah restaurant is changing. First, the smaller restaurant, which opens on Prafulla Sarkar Street, turned into a singing bar. It changed the character of the place, not to say the street, with the noise level going up considerably as well as the crowd. Many more lights were added, and a number of restaurants too. Meanwhile the old Chung Wah, which is connected to the smaller restaurant but opens on CR Avenue, seemed to be continuing the way it was.         
	But now that has been done up too. The cabins on the two sides have been touched with bright green paint on top, courtesy a liquor company, and have also been named, in Bengali, after literary masterpieces, but also other things.         
	So the cabins are now called Shesher Kobita, Chokher Bali, Banalata Sen or Hothat Neerar Jonyo. But one is also called simply Nesha and another Bagan Poshak. Liquor is quicker, but for the Bengali imagination, the suggestion of poetry does almost as well.         
	Not so smart        
	Riding without a ticket is a crime but what if you can get a ride without using your ticket? Recently, a woman in a hurry to catch the 7.30pm Metro pressed her purse on the smart card reader at Chandni Chowk station to enter the platform. She tried to check the balance on her card, but the display was blank  the turnstile wasnt working.         
	She cursed it and boarded the train. While leaving, she again slammed her purse on the ticket machine. It beeped without showing the fare. Hours later, she found her Metro smart card lying at the bottom of her handbag and not inside the purse she had used at the smart card gate. Some smart machine!       POULOMI BANERJEE AND ANAMIKA SANYAL

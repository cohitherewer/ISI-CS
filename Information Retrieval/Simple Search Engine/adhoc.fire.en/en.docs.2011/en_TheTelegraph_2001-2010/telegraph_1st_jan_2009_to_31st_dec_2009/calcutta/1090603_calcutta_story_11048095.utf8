                      Passion and illusion                    Indian philosophy is founded on the dominance of destiny, which rules over the lives of mere mortals. Composed in 1888, Tagores lyrical drama Mayar Khela explores how fate intervenes at every step in the lives of its protagonists, manipulating their actions and consequences. Maayaa, this evenings dance presentation by Darpani, is based on Tagores classic, which he reformed and revised 50 years later as a dance-drama. Its story narrates the journey of three passionate lovers, Amar, Pramada and Shanta, as they pass through the various shades of love. Destiny guides them as they progress on their journey, making them fall in love and experience its various colours; its ecstasy and imagination, as much as its disharmony and unfulfilment. Finally, the lovers emerge as mere puppets in the hands of maya, an illusive power which determines their choices and, through its perplexing twists and turns, entangles the lovers, only to provide completely different endings to their romance. The principal characters are to be portrayed by Alakananda Roy, Soumili Biswas, Biswajit Sarkar and Arnab Bandyopadhyay, who has also choreographed the production.

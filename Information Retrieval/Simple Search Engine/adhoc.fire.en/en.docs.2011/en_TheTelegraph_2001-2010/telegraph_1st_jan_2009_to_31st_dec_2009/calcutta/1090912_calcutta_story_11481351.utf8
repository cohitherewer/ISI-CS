The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Free run for road-hog pandals
                                                                                                               Free run for road-hog pandals
  - Police, CMC and fire services reluctant to revise rules          OUR BUREAU                                    
	The court prod for fresh guidelines to make Puja more safe, secure and people-friendly has failed to rouse the agencies responsible for the festivals smooth passage.        
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), police and fire services  three of the four agencies meant to provide inputs for the revision of rules by September 15  made it clear on Friday that they were in cholchhe cholbe mode.        
	That, in Puja parlance, means power to the road-hog pandals, most of which do not even bother to take the basic permissions before construction. The complaint against one such pandal, the RK Chatterjee Road Adhibasi Brinda in Kasba, had prompted Justice Sanjib Banerjee on Thursday to call for a fresh set of Puja guidelines.        
	We have no suggestions. Whatever the court decides we will enforce, said the joint commissioner of police (headquarters), Jawed Shamim. But if cops are really bothered about rules, why are there so many traffic-stopper pandals across town? Mums the word for all senior officers.        
	A fire department official said: Our norms are sufficient. Organisers need to be made aware of them. A department source, however, admitted that barely five per cent of the pandals could be inspected because of a lack of manpower.        
	As for the CMC, the only requirements are payment of Rs 2,500 and a declaration that the organiser would abide by the police and the fire brigade norms. We wont make any recommendation, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.        
	CESC, the fourth agency in question, seemed the most concerned and called for steps to ensure better wiring and lawful consumption of electricity.        
	According to the rule book, a puja committee can start constructing the pandal after it gets police approval, which is issued after the organisers submit no-objection certificates (NOCs) from other agencies, such as the fire brigade, CMC and CESC.        
	But why do most structures come up even before the police sanction is issued? This year, the last date for submitting NOCs to the police was September 3. Forget about big theme-based pujas, even a modest pandal will not be ready before Puja if work starts after September 3, said the officer. So much for enforcement of rules.

	Sourav Hazra, 25, was arrested on Friday for allegedly posting an indecent profile of a woman on social networking website Orkut and sending her lewd text messages.        
	The married woman, a friend of Souravs from college, was flooded with indecent scraps. Her husband Manab Mukherjee lodged a complaint with the cyber crime cell of the detective department about the fake profile in February. The cops got in touch with Orkut and got the profile deleted.        
	But the lewd text messages continued. Cops later found that the cellphone number was registered under Souravs name and arrested him.        
	 Student killed: A Class IX student of Bagu Saptagram Sarbeswar High School in Rajarhat was killed on Friday morning after being hit by the bus of Shikharpur Evergreen Kindergarten School, also in Rajarhat. Police said Rinki Mukherjee was riding a bicycle when she was hit. She died on the way to hospital. Residents put up a roadblock for 30 minutes, broke the glass panes of the bus and tried to set it on fire. The mob also damaged the kindergarten school and the house of the bus owner.        
	 Unit test scrapped: The West Bengal Board of Secondary Education on Friday announced it would scrap the fifth unit test in schools affiliated to it from the next academic session. Since the new academic session will start from January next year, it would not be possible to conduct the test, said a board official.        
	 Husband in custody: Arup Ghosh, the husband of Sohini Basu who died under mysterious circumstances on June 11, was on Friday remanded in judicial custody till July 10 along with his mother Lily, sister Indira Chowdhury and brother-in-law Rabi Chowdhury. Sohini had been found lying unconscious in Indiras Garia house by her family on June 11.

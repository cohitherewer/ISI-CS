The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Civic lapses in parking lot deals
                                                                                                               Civic lapses in parking lot deals
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The past two civic boards, led by the Left Front and the Trinamul Congress, had extended undue favours to Simplex Projects Limited for building parking plazas on Rawdon Street and under Lindsay Street, said the mayor on Friday.        
	The state government and the civic body have suffered losses of around Rs 5.35 crore as a result and the figure is likely to grow, added Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.        
	He revealed that the projects were not awarded to the private builder in a transparent manner while responding to queries by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG).         
	The automatic parking plaza on Rawdon Street was commissioned in 2001 at a cost of Rs 8 crore. The agreement was signed by the Prasanta Chatterjee-led Left Front civic board. The automatic parking plaza-cum-mall was commissioned under Lindsay Street in 2007 at a cost of Rs 31 crore. The agreement was inked by the Subrata Mukherjee-led Trinamul Congress board.         
	The civic body granted an interest-free loan of Rs 3 crore to the company for building the Rawdon Street parking plaza.        
	The legal validity of the agreements between the civic body and the company is in question, said the mayor.

	Apropos the article Love actually, February 15, I would like to add that kissing in public is purely personal and affects the individual, but corruption affects the entire country. India will only prosper if the police, people and community leaders act against corruption, political hatred, nepotism and bribery.

	I am dead against public display of affection (PDA). One should not pollute the environment by such behaviour. PDA is just a shade better than pornographic films. It has a negative effect on society, especially on young minds. Such activities defile the environment of parks, where children come to play and the elderly enjoy a chat.           
	A public show of affection means the relationship is more about lust than love. It is strange that Delhi High Court has condoned PDA by a married couple. In any case, married people dont need to come out in the public and kiss. What can be done within the privacy of the home should not be brought out in the open.           
	Amrita Mallik,
  Salt Lake                     
	I favour kissing in public, as in all free societies.           
	Ayan Majumdar,
  Address not mentioned                     
	I am strictly against PDA in any form. The pure and divine acts of lovers have ensured that families think twice before venturing into Victoria Memorial, Millennium Park and other tourist spots in the city. By showing off their love, the couples may think of themselves as modern, but they are throwing civility and decency to the wind, sending wrong signals to adolescents. It is high time the authorities act against couples spreading moral pollution.

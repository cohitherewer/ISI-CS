The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Delay doom for flyover 
                                                                                                               Delay doom for flyover 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Work on the three-lane second flyover near Baghajatin railway station and the northern and southern approach roads to EM Bypass has resumed after months but the delay has raised doubts on its timely completion.         
	The construction started in November 2008 and was scheduled to be completed in 18 months. But soon after work started, the project was halted for four months over the supply of building materials.         
	The 600m-long flyover with a 10.05m carriageway is expected to facilitate airport and Sector V-bound traffic. A number of hospitals and schools are located on this stretch too.         
	The project, to be executed by a private agency engaged by the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), was initially estimated to cost Rs 44 crore.        
	The funds are being provided under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) scheme.        
	Hardly two months after the project started, work was stopped by local youths with political backing, who demanded they be allowed to supply materials.        
	But the authorities did not agree to their proposal. The impasse dragged on for four months.         
	The problems are over and the work is going on. We hope it will be finished in time, said Ananda Ganguly, the chief engineer of the CMDAs traffic and transport wing, who is looking after the project.        
	But an official of the agency executing the project did not rule out the possibility of missing the deadline. We have lost some vital months and soon it will start raining, making it difficult for us to proceed with the work, said a spokesperson for the agency.

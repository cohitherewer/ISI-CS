  - SCHOOLKIDS MAKE THEIR OWN GEAR TO WATCH ECLIPSE										                              HERE COMES THE SUN: Young participants test the telescope, pinhole projector and sun goggles made by them at a workshop organised by BITM on July 21. Picture by Anindya Shankar Ray 			               
	While the world geared up to see the longest total solar eclipse of the 21st century, Birla Industrial and Technological Museum (BITM) prepared youngsters for it, too.         
	Celebrating the International Year of Astronomy, it organised a workshop to train children from 30 schools to make various instruments for viewing the eclipse, including a simple telescope, a pinhole projector and sun goggles, on July 21.         
	The telescopes the students made are simplified versions of the original telescope, said Dilip Ghosh, the education officer at BITM.         
	After taking a look at the refracting telescope with a four-inch Zeiss lens that had been mounted in the balcony, the students learned the principles behind its functioning.         
	The main difference between a professional telescope and an ordinary one is that the first will have an objective main lens, while the ones the kids made have a big lens and a small one, explained Ghosh.         
	We also made a solar tracker, with a lens, mirror and cardboard. It is useful during an eclipse, as it catches the reflection of the moving sun, said Rishab Bacchawat of Class X, Delhi Public School, New Town.         
	We really enjoyed making these instruments. We got to learn and it was also a lot of fun as we worked with friends, said Unmesha Banerjee, a student of Class VI from Salt Lake School. While kids from classes below VII were involved in making the solar goggles and the pinhole projector, students of Class VIII to X made the telescope.         
	The pinhole projector had three pieces which needed to be cut and put together so that on one end, there was a pin hole through which the light or eclipse could be seen, said Nimagna Hazra, a student of Class VI of Salt Lake School.         
	Among the other schools participating were Hartley High and Pratt Memorial. Projects like these help boost the childrens confidence. They feel that nothing is impossible, said the director of BITM, E. Islam.

	A book-reading at Jadavpur Universitys Vivekananda Hall on July 10 saw a dance performance and recitation of the poems of Amir Khusro to illustrate the various forms of ecstasy, as they appear in the book, Performing Ecstasy: The Poetics and Politics of Religion in India.         
	A compilation of essays on subjects including dance, Indian temple architecture and yoginis in Persian and Arabian texts, the book, priced Rs 650, is edited by Pallabi Chakravorty and Scott Kugle.         
	Organised by the School of Media Communication and Culture, it began with a performance by Chakravorty to demonstrate how bhav and rasa or spiritual rapture are invoked in Indian Classical dance.         
	The ideal rasa does not include the vibhatsa (terrifying) rasa, but I included it in my piece, remembering the riots in Godhra. Just as the good and bad balance each other, this was a way of linking agony and ecstasy, explained Chakravorty.        
	The idea of the book came to me after the riots, said Chakravorty, whose previous book Bells of Change was a study on Kathak dance, women and modernity in India. Chakravortys own essay speaks of the common influences in art forms like thumri and kathak.         
	Referring to Chakravortys performance, Scott Kugle, the co-editor, explained how her gestures were similar to the adab (behaviour) employed while singing a qawwali, a form of Sufi devotional music.         
	Talking about her essay Krishnas Dance and Devotional Practice in the Temple Courtyards of Seventeenth Century Bengal, Pika Ghosh explained: In India, Bengal architecture was to a certain extent overshadowed by Mughal architecture. Ghosh, who teaches at the University of North Carolina, writes about the architecture in the Shyam Rai temple in Bishnupur in the essay.         
	We are constantly trying to bring together performance, culture and communication. This was one such effort, Said Nilanjana Gupta, who teaches English at Jadavpur University and was one of the organisers.

The programme ended with by a cultural programme, where 346 students participated.              Road safety tips  
	Lafarge India organised a safety training programme for children in June. The day started off with a trip to the Traffic Training School of Calcutta Police at Tallah Park.         
	All participants were between the age group of six to 15 years. Dipankar Chakraborty, the officer-in-charge of the Traffic Training School, explained the precautions one should take while on the road. A model on road safety was also explained with the help of cartoons. Participants also learnt basic road safety rules, like watching both flanks before crossing a busy road and the meaning of the various traffic signals.         
	This was followed by a quiz on traffic-related modules. The day ended with the youngsters giving their feedback about the session.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Back after train ride with rogues 
                                                                                                               Back after train ride with rogues 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Students of Jogamaya Devi College who were allegedly assaulted by drunk men on the Gurudev Express on their way back from a study tour in Kerala returned to the city on Tuesday afternoon.        
	Many of the 58 girls had not got over the shock of Sunday nights incident, which led to the arrest of two passengers, as the train pulled into Santragachhi station after a 41-hour journey. Some started crying seeing their parents on the platform.        
	We can never forget Sundays nightmare. Not only did seven or eight drunk men harass us for nearly half an hour, we did not get any help from the Railway Police Force personnel and policemen in Kerala. Some men in uniform even teased us, said Sayani Dutta, a second-year geography honours student of the south Calcutta college.         
	The girls along with four teachers had boarded the train at Ernakulam on Sunday evening, after a 10-day study tour. They found the men occupying their reserved seats and drinking.        
	According to the students, the men pounced on them when they protested. The girls were forced to pull the chain as the train was leaving the station. Even after seeing the situation, some RPF men kept asking us why we had pulled the chain before taking the men away. When we tried to lodge a complaint at Trichur station, men in uniform teased the students, said a teacher.        
	The students finally lodged a complaint with railway officials at Pallaghat station in Kerala. We got enough security only after the train reached Andhra Pradesh, said Abanti Basu, the teacher-in-charge of the tour.         
	Rail officials told us two men were arrested. We want action against all of them and the insensitive RPF and police officers, added Basu.         
	The students union at the college, controlled by the SUCI, has written to railway minister Mamata Banerjee demanding steps against the accused.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hopes dashed for early Metro on Sundays 
                                                                                                               Hopes dashed for early Metro on Sundays

	Metro Railway is set to shelve its plan to start the Sunday service from 11.30am, instead of the usual 2pm, thanks to unsatisfactory footfall during the trial run over the past two weeks.        
	The results of the trial run on the past two Sundays were unsatisfactory, a Metro official said. The experimental run has been stopped.        
	Chief operations manager J.K. Mitra said the results had been recorded but there was no possibility of any immediate change to our Sunday schedule.        
	The proposal for an early start of the Metro service on Sundays will be considered during the next review of the train frequency and timings, added Mitra.        
	This Sunday, 21,809 passengers travelled on Metro trains between 11.30am and 2pm. On March 22, the footfall was 15,424. Records with the Metro authorities put the average passenger count in a two-and-a-half-hour period after 2pm at 30,000.        
	The turnout on the second Sunday was better than the first but only half the usual weekend figure, said an official.        
	Many regular Metro commuters, however, blamed the poor turnout on a lack of awareness campaign.        
	On March 22, I did not know that the trains were running from 11am and hired a taxi to reach office on Park Street. After being informed by a colleague about the trial run, I travelled by Metro this Sunday. The authorities should have done more to advertise the new timing than just putting up a notice beside the ticket counters, said Tanima Mondal, a resident of Behala.        
	A section of passengers demanded that the authorities scrap their decision to discontinue the trial run.        
	It should continue for at least two more Sundays before the authorities take a decision. We need Metro trains more on Sundays because of fewer alternatives, said Yashodhara Ghosh, a postgraduate student and resident of Jodhpur Park.        
	We can do a lot of things on Sunday mornings if the Metro service starts early, said IT professional Souvik Basu.

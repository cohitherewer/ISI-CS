The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Blame it on El Nino amp; Aila
                                                                                                               Blame it on El Nino amp; Aila
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	The sweat that the city wiped off its brow on Tuesday could be blamed not only on the Aila effect over the Bay of Bengal but also on the impending El Nino on the Pacific Ocean.        
	Rainless swelter was the order of the day with the mercury touching 37.4 degree Celsius, four points above normal, and the maximum humidity soaring to 93 per cent. The discomfort index was 67.4 degree Celsius, 12 points above normal.        
	The situation is likely to persist for another 24 hours. The chance of localised thunderstorms cant be ruled out, but they can provide only temporary relief, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	According to independent weather analysts, the monsoon flow would not be activated before June 20. Weather prediction models hold out hope of a monsoon surge this weekend with the formation of a low-pressure area over the north-west Bay of Bengal.        
	A low pressure formation developing into a depression could arise from north of the Andamans after June 20 and move in a north-westerly direction. It would give the monsoon the necessary push, take it further into the mainland and activate the flow, said group captain O.P. Sharma, the chief meteorologist of Skymet, a non-government agency providing customised weather information.        
	If analysts here continued blaming Aila for dragging the monsoon in early and also draining it dry, global weather scientists warned of El Nino warming the sea waters, replacing the cooling effect of La Nina, to stifle Monsoon 2009.        
	Occurring two to four times in a decade and lasting about 12-18 months, El Nino directly affects our monsoon, said Leela Sen, a geographer in Calcutta.         
	Typically, El Nino leads to lesser rain, while La Nina leads to more rain during the monsoon.        
	The India Meteorological Department (IMD), which forecasts the progress of the Indian monsoon, said that a definite picture would emerge in the next few days. The situation is not exactly alarming, but we are a little worried, said a senior IMD official from Pune. El Nino, if it strengthens between July and September, could impact the rains.        
	The cause could be Aila or El Nino, but the effect was there for all to see and suffer on Tuesday.        
	Gaurav Agarwal, a student of Birla High School, was seen leaning against his father when school gave over, drained by the heat and humidity. The heat is unbearable. When will it rain? mumbled the boy.        
	The schools, well aware of the toll that the rainless monsoon was taking on the children, were struggling to balance classes and compassion.        
	Normally the rains start by June 8-9 and so we reopened on June 15, but we cannot keep declaring holidays because of the weather, said Devi Kar, the principal of Modern High School for Girls. We understand it is tough on the students, and it was really bad today, but we have our syllabus to complete and also maintain the stipulated number of working hours as directed by the council.        
	At Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School, principal Malini Bhagat said classes would continue but all outdoor activities are being conducted indoors and students are being told to take extra precautions.

                                                                                                               Para glows in chess champ pride
          SPOTLIGHT - KHUSHI DHAREWA                          Khushi, 7, plays computer games at her BK Pal Avenue home. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                                  
	Khushi Dharewa loves Cartoon Network and Shah Rukh Khan, but not more than a game of chess.         
	Now, most of BK Pal Avenue, where Khushi lives with her parents and extended family, knows about her talent in thinking moves and countermoves on the black-and-white board.         
	The seven-year-old has become a sport sensation in this old north Calcutta locality after winning the 22nd National U-7 Girls Chess Championship in Nagpur on January 7.         
	Residents of our building came to meet Khushi. Neighbours whom we had never met also dropped by to congratulate her. It was heartwarming, says Khushis father Anand, who runs a textile business in Burrabazar. They gave me chocolates, says Khushi, with a twinkle in her eyes.         
	The Class III student of Ashok Hall showed a flair for chess when she was introduced to the game in school in 2006. To her parents surprise, Khushi went on to win the inter-school tournament the same year. In 2007, she participated in The Telegraph Schools Chess Championship.         
	No one in our family plays chess. But since Khushi was interested in the game and was also performing well, we thought of providing her professional help, says her homemaker mother Alka.        
	Currently, Khushi is training at home under Shyamol Dutta, the chief coach at Calcutta Chess Academy. Once a week, she goes to the academy to practice with children in her age group.         
	Her other wins include the State U-7 Girls Championship, hosted by the West Bengal Chess Association, and the U-8 girls category at Chess for Youth, organised by Dibyendu Baruas Chess Academy, in May 2008.        
	In the run-up to the national championship, Khushi practised four to five hours a day. At that time, studies lost their priority. I practised on the laptop. I would solve puzzles and mind games too.         
	Though she was playing outside home turf for the first time, Khushi was not jittery. I wasnt tense. The players were all my age. In the final round I felt I had to win and I did, says Khushi, who also plays tennis at Shyambazar Tennis Club in Deshbandhu Park.        
	Chess remains her first love because there is no knock-out in chess as in tennis. So I wont be thrown out of the tournament.         
	Her other favourite sport is playing with her cousins at 88 BK Pal Avenue, which has been home to her family for the past 32 years. The Dharewas hail from Rajasthan.         
	I love to go pandal-hopping during Durga puja. I like going to Kumartuli Park and the childrens park on Jatindra Mohan Avenue. More than the idols, I love riding the giant wheel there, says Khushi.         
	Among the things she loves about her para is the phuchkawala. I have phuchkas on my way home from the chess academy. I carry on even if mom scolds me, she says.        
	After her triumph at the Nagpur meet, Khushi has had little time for phuchkas. Apart from the steady stream of neighbours, the Paschim Bang Hindi Bhassi Samaj, an association of the Hindi-speaking community, paid a visit to congratulate her.        
	At school, the little star was presented an iPod. My friends congratulated me and my teachers said that they were very proud of me and I should go on winning prizes! she says.         
	Now, Khushi has set her sights on the U-8 World Championship in Turkey, slated later this year.

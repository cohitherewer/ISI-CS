                      Inspired by fact and fiction                    Literary sources, specially the popular bazaar arts of the 19th century and that of the Bengal Renaissance, often acted as points of reference to artists of Bengal who sought liberation from the colonisation of art practice in the subcontinent. However, rarely did these artists seek to illustrate the texts that they drew on. Instead, they expanded and commented upon them, exploring the unspoken and unseen, often giving birth to new dimensions of interpretation. It is from this rich lineage and legacy that the contemporary artist-storytellers in Tell-tale: Fiction, Falsehood amp; Fact emerge. The ongoing second part of this series features works by Amritah Sen, Anupam Chakraborty, Rajesh Deb, Sarnath Banerjee and Sujay Mukherjee (a fiberglass work by him appears here). Embodying a search for pseudo-intellectualism, Amritah Sens works are full of the wit, sarcasm and humour that can be found in the writings of renowned Bengali satirists Sukumar Ray and Parashuram. Lyrical and evocative in the Bengal School tradition, the art works of Anupam Chakraborty celebrate the power and beauty of nature as expressed in the works of Bengals poets. Rajesh Deb mocks dubious political practices using Sukumar Rays Abol Tabol as a point of reference. Using forgotten documents from Lalbazar, the citys police headquarters, as his source, Sarnath Banerjee has on display a work that represents the underbelly of the society. Sujay Mukherjee chooses to address newer forms of deification in a brand new era of globalisation. Curator: Dr Paula Sengupta.

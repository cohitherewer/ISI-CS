	Heisnam Kanhailal is in town rehearsing with 17 actors from Calcutta Achin Gnayer Gatha, the first play to be produced by Minerva Natya Sanskriti Charcha Kendra. It will be staged on October 12 at the theatre.         
	The redoubtable director of Kalakshetra theatre group from Imphal has been commissioned by the Minerva Kendra. He is being assisted by wife Sabitri, an actress.        
	Achin Gnayer Gatha takes off from a production Kanhailal had started in Manipur called Uchek Langneidong. Uchek Langneidong is the name of a bird, he says. The play is the story of a woman whose cruelty forces her stepdaughter to fly away with the birds. The stepmother, sensing her mistake, turns to Kali for help. The goddess appears in many forms and teaches her that love, when it is restricted to ones personal possession, is an evil, and makes her realise the value of motherhood.        
	The Manipuri production was not completed. So here I am trying to see the theme from another regional perspective, says Kanhailal. The play here draws from many Bengali tales and music traditions. Though Kanhailal gives little importance to written scripts and allows plays to develop from workshops, Debashish Majumdar is helping out with the dialogues. Sabitri and Jayati Bose are in charge of movements and choreography. Set and costume will be by Niloy Sengupta and lights by Joy Sen.        
	The Kendra, set up to revive Minerva theatre, is producing the play with over Rs 5 lakh. The play will be required to prove its commercial viability through shows at Minerva and other theatres. But being 1 hour and 10 minutes long, it wouldnt be suitable for independent shows.

	Fifteen companies of central forces have stayed back for guarding counting centres in and around the city on Saturday, chief electoral officer Debashis Sen announced on Friday.        
	Six companies of central forces will be deployed in the six counting centres across Calcutta. The remaining nine will be deployed in North and South 24-Parganas, said Sen.        
	The central forces will form the outer ring of the three-tier security cordon around the centres on the day of the Lok Sabha election results. The other two tiers will be manned by the state police.        
	Counting personnel will arrive before 5am and the observers and other officials before 7am. Counting will start at 8am and will be completed by 4pm, Sen added.        
	The commission has launched a website, www.eciresults.nic.in, to make the results available instantly.        
	The commission has requested CESC and the state power utility to provide uninterrupted supply to all 52 counting centres in Bengal. There would also be generator back-up at the centres.         
	After meeting senior state government officials and police officers at Writers Buildings on Friday, chief secretary Ashok Mohan Chakrabarti said security measures had been planned fearing trouble. He announced there would be restrictions on the use of cellphones in the counting centres and not more than four people will be allowed to accompany the winning candidates when they go to collect their certificates.

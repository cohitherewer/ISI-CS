                                                                                                               Guard dead in reservoir
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The security guard of a building under construction on Manoharpukur Road was found dead on Thursday morning. Children playing on the premises spotted the body in the reservoir of the building.         
	Police said Raj Kumar Rajak, 55, died of drowning. A medical examination did not reveal any injuries, but cops are not ruling out foul play.        
	Jawed Shamim, the city detective chief, said Rajak had left his home nearby on Wednesday morning saying he would be back for lunch but did not return.         
	In the afternoon, Rajaks family members went to the housing complex but failed to find him. They even contacted his friends, but couldnt trace him, said an officer.        
	A port-mortem examination revealed alcohol in Rajaks stomach. The police learnt that Rajak used to drink with some local youths in the complex.        
	We suspect Rajak was thrown into the reservoir, said the officer.        
	The police said they were questioning local residents to know more about the youths.

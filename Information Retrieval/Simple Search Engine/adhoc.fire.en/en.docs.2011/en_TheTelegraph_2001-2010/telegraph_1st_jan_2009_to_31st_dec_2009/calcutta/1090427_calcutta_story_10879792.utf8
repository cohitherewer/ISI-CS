The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 3 held for Tangra assault
                                                                                                               3 held for Tangra assault

	A gang of three was arrested on Sunday for a robbery bid and assault in Tangras Chinatown last month.        
	Police said the three men  all in their 30s  had barged into the flat of retired businessman Paul Lambher on March 25 morning, armed with a chopper and revolver. They attacked his 26-year-old son when he resisted and chased them.        
	We interrogated the trio to find out about their leader. Raids are on to nab the mastermind. The gang appears to be involved in several cases of dacoity in the city, said an officer.         
	Cops said one of the accused is wanted by Bengal police in connection with several dacoity cases and another has served five years in a murder case and is out on bail.         
	On March 25, the three dacoits entered the two-storey building at 3F Tangra Road around 11am and reached the first floor, where Paul lives with his wife, daughter and son Samuel.        
	Paul and his wife, a teacher at Grace Ling Liang High School in Tangra, were not home. The dacoits rang the doorbell and Samuel, a chef with a five star hotel in south Calcutta, opened the door. His sister was in her room. Two of the men, brandishing a revolver and chopper, barged in while another stood guard at the gate of the building.         
	One of them grabbed Samuel from behind and asked him to hand over the keys of the cupboard but the youth resisted them. The duo panicked and tried to flee with Rs 250 lying on a table. Samuel chased and shoved them as they ran down the stairs and one of them hit him on the elbow with the chopper and also sliced through his palm.         
	I received over 30 stitches on my hand and elbow and will have to undergo surgery on my left palm, Samuel said on Sunday.        
	The incident sent shock waves through the neighbourhood of Chinatown. We are feeling unsafe as criminals rule the roost here. They extort money from restaurant owners and have also started targeting their families, said an owner of an eatery on Tangra Road.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Trader car not returned
                                                                                                               Trader car not returned
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Sachin Halder has not got back his Tata Safari though four days have passed since the high court ordered the South 24-Parganas administration to return the car, requisitioned for election work.        
	The appeal moved by the administration against the order will come up for hearing before the division bench on Monday, said the lawyer representing the district magistrate.        
	Dipankar Basu, the lawyer representing Halder, said he was yet to receive a copy of the appeal.         
	But I will be in the court on Monday and oppose the appeal, he added.        
	Halder said he would claim compensation if his car was damaged.         
	He had bought the car for his wife Gayatri, who cannot go out in the sun because of a chronic skin ailment and has to travel 54km for treatment once every week.        
	The SUV travelled about 200km with an election observer on Friday, said its driver.

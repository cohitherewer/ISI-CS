The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Teachers charged in strip case
                                                                                                               Teachers charged in strip case
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The teachers who allegedly strip-searched two Class VII girls in a Birati school on Tuesday have been charged with outraging their modesty even as the principal denied that the students were made to shed clothes.        
	Kabita Barui and Aditi Maitra were looking for Rs 50 that a classmate of the girls had lost. The teachers have been charged under sections 354 (outraging the modesty of a woman) and 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) of the IPC, following a complaint by the father of one of the girls.         
	We will decide on arresting the teachers after completing our investigation, said a police officer.         
	Principal Swati Panchanan (Kanjilal) said the way the teachers searched the girls might have been wrong but the teenagers were not made to strip.        
	I had apologised to the guardians when they visited me on Wednesday with their complaint. We had decided to call a guardians meet to discuss how to deal with such situations, she added.        
	The two girls did not attend school on Thursday.        
	The principal said no action would be taken against the girls.         
	Swine flu suspects: Two children with swine flu-like symptoms were sent from the city airport to Beleghata ID Hospital on Thursday. Arian Dutta, an eight-year-old from the city, arrived on an Emirates flight from Dubai. Arnab Panigrahi, a six-year-old UK national, arrived on an Air India flight from London with his parents. Both boys were suffering from fever.         
	Mishap death: A lorry ran over a 42-year-old trader at the Raja Manindra Road-Northern Avenue crossing on Thursday morning. The driver fled.        
	Bomb hoax: A bomb threat over phone sparked panic at a private hotel management institute in Sector V on Thursday morning. A search by police did not yield explosives.        
	One held: An East Midnapore resident was held in Alipore for allegedly robbing a cellphone shop in the Lake area.

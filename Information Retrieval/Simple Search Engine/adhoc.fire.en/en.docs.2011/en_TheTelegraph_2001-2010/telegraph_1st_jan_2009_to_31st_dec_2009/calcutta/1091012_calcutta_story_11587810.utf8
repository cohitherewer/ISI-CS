The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fire rule flout by govt unit
                                                                                                               Fire rule flout by govt unit

	A government industrial estate that firemen risked their lives to save during a blaze in a katatel factory next door is as much of a rule-flouting tinderbox as the illegal fuel depot.        
	An FIR lodged by the fire brigade against Udayan Industrial Estate in Tangra stated that firemen who had entered the estate while battling last Mondays blaze saw inflammable material stocked everywhere without basic fire-prevention measures. An inquiry revealed that the industrial estate didnt have the mandatory safety certificate from the fire services department.        
	We have filed a police complaint against the occupiers of both 3 and 4 Pagladanga Road, said a senior fire brigade official. The fire department has urged the police to seal the premises and CESC to disconnect power supply.         
	The industrial estate, which functions under the West Bengal Small Industries Development Corporation, has grown over the last decade. With the logistical advantage of being close to the EM Bypass, it includes over 65 sheds and 26 plots totalling nearly 2,30,000sq ft. It houses packaging, leather, engineering, electronics, polymer, rubber and chemical units.        
	Representatives of some of the 90-odd industrial units washed their hands of the fire-safety issue. I dont think individual establishments are required to get fire-safety clearance. The estate as a whole needs to get clearance, and that is the industries development corporations responsibility, said the manager of a unit manufacturing electrical fittings.        
	The minister for micro and small-scale enterprises, Manab Mukherjee, said he was out of station for a few days and hence unaware of the developments.        
	An official of his department hoped it isnt too late to get the fire clearance.

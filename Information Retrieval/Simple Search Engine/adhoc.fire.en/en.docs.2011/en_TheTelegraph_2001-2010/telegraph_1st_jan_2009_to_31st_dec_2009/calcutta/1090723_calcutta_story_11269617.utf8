                                                                                                               Script changes in JEE dispute
  - Judge recalls order that gave trio a chance to get papers re-evaluated          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                                                  
	A high court judge who had ruled in favour of three JEE examinees seeking re-evaluation of their answer scripts has recalled his order three weeks later after re-evaluating the legality of their claim.         
	Justice Dipankar Dutta dismissed the petition filed by Subhasish Kesh, Sammilani Bhattacharya and Soumya Konar on Wednesday on the ground that the rules of the JEE Board contained no clause on re-evaluation.         
	He also asked the board to refund the money the candidates had deposited for re-evaluation of their answer scripts after his July 3 order.         
	This is a very rare case of a judge not only reopening a case he/she has settled but also recalling the verdict. Justice Dutta must be commended for doing a rethink before his ruling opened the floodgates for more re-evaluation claims, said advocate Debabrata Chatterjee.         
	Subhasish, Sammilani and Soumya, who were not satisfied with their ranks in JEE 2009, are not the first students to have moved court against an examination board in recent years. But re-evaluation of answer scripts remains a contentious subject with courts ruling both for and against such claims.         
	A 2005 judgment by the division bench of former Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice S. Sen in a similar case against the School Service Commission (SSC) prompted Justice Dutta to review his order.         
	The JEE Board had moved a division bench against Justice Duttas July 3 order to produce the physics, chemistry and biology answer scripts of the petitioners in court. The bench refused to stay the order but said Justice Dutta should look at the case afresh, standing counsel Subrata Mukhopadhyay told Metro.         
	When the JEE Board went to Justice Dutta with the answer scripts on July 17, the judge said he would go by the 2005 judgment in the SSC case. According to that ruling, examinees have no right to seek a review of answer scripts unless there is a provision in the rules of the examination-conducting authority.

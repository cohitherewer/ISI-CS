The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mass failure in MSc exam
                                                                                                               Mass failure in MSc exam
  - Students demand redress after third-semester shocker          MITA MUKHERJEE                                                  
	More than 60 per cent of the students who wrote Calcutta Universitys third-semester MSc physics exam have failed the test, triggering a frantic search for the force of gravity behind the plummeting pass percentage.        
	Examinees hurled questions and examiners hunted for answers after the announcement of the MSc results, by far the worst in recent years. The average pass percentage in physics is usually over 90 per cent.        
	We are examining what triggered such a drastic drop. The number of failures is distressing given the fact that our department offers a very high standard of education. We are really worried, said Goutam Ganguly, the head of CUs physics department.        
	Some students claimed that their answer scripts were not examined properly. Each student in our department is meritorious. Only those who get first-class marks (above 60 per cent) in BSc get seats. We will intensify our agitation if the authorities do not rectify the errors, said a student who failed. He had scored 65 per cent in the BSc physics exam.        
	Vice-chancellor Suranjan Das contested allegations of irregularities in evaluation. Students are free to see their answer scripts if they want to, he said.        
	Those who have failed in all subjects cannot write the fourth-semester test, which means they will lose a year. The university is planning to hold a supplementary exam for the rest. It will be tough studying for the final semester simultaneously, said a student who was shocked by the results.        
	Officials of the universitys examination department said a preliminary inquiry suggested that most students were uncomfortable with the semester system that was introduced a couple of years ago. Students are used to writing one exam a year, not one every six months, an official said.

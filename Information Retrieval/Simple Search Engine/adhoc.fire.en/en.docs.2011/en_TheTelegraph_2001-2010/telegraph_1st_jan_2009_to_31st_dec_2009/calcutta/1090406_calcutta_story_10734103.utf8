The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pre-poll cop scan on risky zones
                                                                                                               Pre-poll cop scan on risky zones
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Police are drawing up a list of sensitive areas, apart from sensitive booths, where security will be tightened in the run up to the polls and on the D-Day, May 13.        
	The officers-in-charge of all 48 police stations in the city have been asked to prepare the lists of sensitive areas, based on certain parameters fixed by Lalbazar, and hand them over to the headquarters well before the polls.        
	Officers said this was the first time they were preparing such lists before a poll. The practice so far has been to identify vulnerable booths where the authorities arrange for special security.        
	Policing at sensitive booths has always been strong. But if voters are intimidated in their immediate neighbourhoods, a section will feel inclined to stay away from polling booths. So we are trying to ensure voters feel safe to step out on the poll day, said the additional commissioner of police, Banibrata Basu.        
	Patrolling will be intensified in the sensitive areas to ensure party supporters do not get to intimidate voters, he added.        
	While identifying a sensitive area, the cops have been asked to consider whether it has witnessed political clashes, whether the neighbourhood is known to be crime-prone and the extent of political polarisation.        
	The survey has to be exhaustive. One should take into account if there are railway stations or shanties around, the number of entry and exit points and the possibility of goons pouring in from outside on the poll day, said an officer overseeing the preparation of a list at Tollygunge police station.        
	The security assessment assumes more significance for the cops before this election because of the uncertainty over deployment of central forces.        
	The assessment is also necessary because the poll panel has decided to strictly enforce the curb on setting up camps within 200 metres of a polling station, said a senior police officer.

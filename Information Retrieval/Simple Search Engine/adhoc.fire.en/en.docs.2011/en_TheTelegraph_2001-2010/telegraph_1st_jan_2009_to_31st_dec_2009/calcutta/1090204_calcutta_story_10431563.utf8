The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fresh faces, techniques stump cops
                                                                                                               Fresh faces, techniques stump cops
          OUR BUREAU                                        Arms and ammunition siezed from the   Baguiati house      
	The new year has been not so happy for police, with the city witnessing a spurt in crime over the past few weeks. What has compounded the cops woes is the entry of new groups in the world of crime.        
	Among the recent incidents that had stumped the police were the seizure of a huge cache of arms from a Baguiati house, three youths forcing an elderly businessman to write three bearer cheques for Rs 11 lakh and a gang robbing around Rs 1.3 crore from a trading firm in Fairlie Place.        
	In the last two cases, the money was recovered but the mode of operation came as a surprise, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police (detective department).        
	As a preventive measure, the anti-dacoity wing of the detective department is supposed to maintain an extensive network of contacts to gather intelligence on criminals and their plans. But the recent spurt in dacoity suggests that the network has failed.        
	In most cases, we keep a tab on known offenders. Our problem is the sudden rise in the number of new gangs in the city and its adjoining areas, said a senior officer.        
	All 13 men arrested in three major cases  three in the Rs 11-lakh cheque case, five in connection with the Rs 1.3-crore robbery and five for a series of robberies in North 24-Parganas  were first-time offenders. Police records say several students and professionals, new to the world of crime, have been arrested in the past few months.        
	Another headache for the cops is the frequent use of firearms in robberies.        
	The most recent proof of easy availability of firearms is the arrest of an 18-year-old boy from Titagarh, who was rounded up after a revolver and five bullets were found in his school bag.         
	On January 17, cops arrested three students, who were to sit for the Higher Secondary examination this year, for a series of robberies in Barasat and Madhyamgram. Several firearms were seized from them.        
	To top it all, came the Baguiati arms seizure. The alleged kingpin, Nemai Das, was a Group D employee of Rajarhat-Gopalpur municipality and, according to police records, a first-time offender.        
	Tracking people who deal in firearms is the best way to gather intelligence on criminals and their plans. The recent spurt in crime suggests that we have not been able to infiltrate into the cartels of firearm dealers, said a retired officer of Calcutta police.        
	The trend has worried psychologists, too. We are witnessing a rise in the impulse control problem among young people, which is driving them towards crime to fulfil their needs. In the absence of proper parental guidance, they fail to recognise that they are taking the path of crime, said psychologist Atashi Gupta.

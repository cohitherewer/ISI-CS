                                                                                                               BSF to train jail guards
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Jail guards will be trained by the Border Security Force in tackling emergencies, such as jailbreaks or a riot by prisoners.        
	A contingent of BSF officers have been brought to the prison departments training school in West Midnapore and it has been decided that all jail guards will be trained in batches.        
	The decision was taken on Wednesday at a meeting between the prison departments top brass and home secretary Ardhendu Sen at Alipore Correctional Home.        
	Security is one of our top concerns and the training will ensure the prison guards are fit to handle any situation. We also discussed issues related to administrative reforms, said B.D. Sharma, inspector- general (prisons).         
	The superintendents of all jails have been asked to be in uniform while on duty and the jail staff have been asked to share intelligence about the inmates with the detective department of the city police regularly.

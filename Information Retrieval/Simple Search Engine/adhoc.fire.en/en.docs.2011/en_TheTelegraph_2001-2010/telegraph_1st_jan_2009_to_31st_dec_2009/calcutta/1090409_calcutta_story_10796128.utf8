The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Gherao for ragging rap
                                                                                                               Gherao for ragging rap
          A STAFF REPORTER                                        A poster at the gate of Aurobindo Bhavan in JU		      
	More than 70 students of Jadavpur University gheraoed vice-chancellor P.N. Ghosh and some other senior officials on Wednesday evening to protest the decision to suspend a student found guilty of ragging for a semester.        
	The students from various departments of the engineering faculty picketed in front of Aurobindo Bhavan, where the universitys executive committee met and ratified its decision to suspend Rajiv Das.        
	We want the decision to be reversed because it will make Rajiv suffer academically, said a member of the group that blocked the Aurobindo Bhavan gate to prevent Ghosh, pro vice-chancellor Sidhartha Dutta and other officials from coming out.        
	The blockade was not lifted till late on Wednesday, with the students threatening to continue their agitation till the authorities withdrew the decision.        
	Ghosh ruled out revoking the suspension. The decision has been taken keeping in mind a Supreme Court ruling on ragging. There is no question of the punishment being revoked, he asserted.        
	Kamal Krishna Halder, a first-year student of international relations, had alleged that Rajiv, a third-year student of mechanical engineering, had ragged him in his hostel last September.        
	Halder had written in his complaint to the university that Das had forced him to mimic the shape of a chair with his body and beat him up.        
	Halder approached the universitys anti-ragging commission, following which a probe had been ordered.        
	The commission had recommended that Das be made to serve under National Service Scheme on the campus for three months. That would not have affected his studies, a student claimed.        
	But the executive committee chose to ignore the commissions suggestion and, instead, decided to suspend Rajiv. If the decision is implemented, Rajiv will miss the third-year placements and effectively lose a year, he added.

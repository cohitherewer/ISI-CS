	The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has undertaken structural repairs of the front part of the Currency Building in the BBD Bag area from this month as it has received funds earmarked for this purpose.        
	Repairs of the second floor are complete, and now it needs to be painted. Repairs of the ground and first floors have already started.        
	Funding is received in accordance with requirements, said T.J. Baidya, the superintending archaeologist of the Calcutta circle of ASI.         
	A total of Rs 98 lakh has been allocated, of which Rs 40 lakh is meant for this financial year. It is only after the major structural repairs are over that the ASI will start rebuilding the massive central dome that was demolished some years ago by the Central Public Works Department that intended to construct a highrise office building there.        
	The deadline for the structural repairs is 2010, by which time the ASI library with 15,000 books will be shifted there. The collection was in the ASIs Spirit Building behind the Indian Museum. A modelling section and publication counter will also be set up in Currency Building.        
	ASI has a huge collection of coins, too. These will be displayed in the eastern side of the building on the groundfloor once repairs are over. ASI has 8,000 coins, including silver coins of the British period and those of the Sultanate and Kushana periods.        
	Asked if original materials will be used to restore the building, Baidya said ASI will make the utmost effort to use the best marble available, even if the original Italian marble is not.        
	The tiles up to the dado of the wall that could be seen on the ground floor will also be replaced. An Indian firm has agreed to provide tiles of the same design, possibly originating from the Arts and Crafts movement in England in the 19th Century.         
	As to Clives house in Dum Dum, restoration work was stalled owing to the presence of seven families of squatters inside the building, against whom legal proceedings were being started, said Baidya.        
	Hastings house in Barasat would require two more years to be restored. Asked why the structure was being reconstructed, Baidya said whenever a structure is in peril this is the only recourse.        
	Hastings house was held together by the roots of banyan trees and after their removal, the house was in danger of collapsing. So it is being reconstructed, Baidya added. Once ready, artefacts from Chandraketugarh belonging to a private collection will be displayed there.

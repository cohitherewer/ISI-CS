	Classes in Jadavpur Universitys history department were suspended on Monday afternoon after a lecturers wife barged into a teachers chamber and tried to beat her up, accusing her of having an affair with her husband.        
	You are responsible for my husband moving out of our home. I will teach you a lesson, the lecturers wife shouted at the teacher after walking into her chamber on the second floor of the arts block around 1pm, said witnesses.        
	The teacher asked the intruder to leave the chamber but she kept accusing her of breaking up her marriage and even tried to slap her. The lecturer, too, reached the chamber and after a heated exchange of about 15 minutes persuaded his wife to leave the room, according to witnesses.        
	The wife then stood in the corridor and shouted at the two for more than half an hour with stunned students, teachers and other employees from various departments watching.        
	The woman even tried to hit maam in full view of everybody, said a student of the history department.        
	Staff members and students tried to pacify the lecturers wife but she kept arguing and refused to leave till the authorities promised to punish the guilty teacher, said a university employee.        
	The pandemonium continued for more than an hour. With students in the corridor, teachers were forced to suspend classes.        
	It was an unfortunate incident. I have submitted a report on it to the registrar. The teacher lodged a written complaint to the authorities against her colleagues wife for creating trouble on the campus, said deputy registrar Partha Lahiri.        
	The teacher also lodged a general diary with Jadavpur police station accusing the lecturers wife of harassing her on the campus.        
	I have lodged complaints with the police and the university authorities to ensure security on the campus and to stop unauthorised entry of outsiders, the woman teacher told Metro.        
	Ragging probe: Fetsu on Tuesday threatened to agitate over the Jadavpur University authorities decision to not include a student representative from the engineering faculty in the committee set up to probe recent ragging complaints.         
	Vice-chancellor P.N. Ghosh said the committee would start work on Wednesday.         
	Five first-year engineering students alleged on Saturday that they were ragged by their seniors. On Monday, they claimed that some senior university officials had forced them to write false complaints of ragging.

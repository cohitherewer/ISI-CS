The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | City students top Net chart
                                                                                                               City students top Net chart
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	City youngsters would rather log on to the Internet than leaf through library books for information, a recent study has found.        
	The survey by IT solutions company Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) of 13,738 students between 12 and 18 years of age in 12 Indian cities also shows that Calcutta has the highest number of students using the Internet as a source of information.        
	The other cities covered by the survey include Bangalore, Hyderabad, Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai.         
	Seventy-seven per cent of the Calcutta students prefer Google and Wikipedia as a source of information, against the national average of 62 per cent.        
	I use Google and Wikipedia a lot, especially for project work assigned to us during the summer holiday. Visiting the library is not an option during holidays whereas I can access the Internet at home, said Sreya Saha, a Class X student of Ashok Hall.        
	Newspapers and magazines are the next most popular source of information for city students. The library is the least used information resource.        
	The Internet is the easiest way to access information. If teachers make more effort to provide extra information, students would not have to check the Internet so often, said Malini Bhagat, the principal of Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School.        
	Despite the Left Fronts opposition to the introduction of computers in the state in the 1980s, the tech tool has penetrated city homes. Seventy-six per cent of the Calcutta students have computers at home, more than the national average of 62 per cent. Delhi and Bangalore, with 77 per cent, top the chart.        
	Twenty-four of the Calcutta students access the Internet on their cellphones, the highest in the country. Social networking is also high on the students agenda, with Orkut emerging as the most popular platform.

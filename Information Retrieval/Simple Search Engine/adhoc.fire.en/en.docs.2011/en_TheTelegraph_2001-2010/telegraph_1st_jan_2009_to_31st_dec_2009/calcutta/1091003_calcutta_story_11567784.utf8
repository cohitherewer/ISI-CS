The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Wet prelude to weekend
                                                                                                               Wet prelude to weekend
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The city received frequent spells of showers on Friday evening even as the weatherman forecast rain and thundershowers over the weekend.        
	The low-pressure area which developed three days ago now lies over Telengana and wont bring rain to south Bengal. But localised thunderclouds will, said an official of the Pune-based India Meteorological Department.         
	Satellite pictures on Friday showed convective clouds over the central and south-west Bay of Bengal.        
	A fresh low-pressure area may form over the west-central Bay around Tuesday, the official warned.

                                                                                                               The City Diary
                The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has removed more than 2,000 uprooted tress since Cyclone Aila brushed past the city. Except two mahogany trees, all others would be auctioned off in the respective boroughs, municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said on Sunday. We will decide about the mahogany trees later.   three-member committee has been formed in each borough to monitor the sale of the logs. Each committee comprises the district conservancy officer, borough executive engineer and an officer from the parks and gardens wing of the civic body.     Thirty-five parrots and 10 other birds of Indian origin were seized from the Air-conditioned Market in Baguiati on Sunday. The bird seller, identified as Umesh Singh, managed to escape.    A 27-year-old youth was found dead beside the railway tracks connecting Dum Dum Cantonment station and the Jessop factory, off Jessore Road, on Sunday morning. Police said Bishu Nayek was lying beside the tracks with deep wounds on his head and face. A preliminary investigation revealed Nayek had been killed somewhere else.    A 22-year-old youth was run over by a private bus on route 58 near Howrah Maidan around 6pm on Sunday. Police said Binode Boral, a resident of Nityadhan Mukherjee Road, was crossing the road when the mishap occurred. The driver and conductor fled. The body has been sent for post-mortem. Around 50 residents blocked GT Road for half an hour protesting lax policing on the stretch. The blockade was lifted after senior police officers intervened.     A fire broke out in a plastic factory near Chetla Lockgate and spread to an adjacent garage around 4.45am on Sunday. Four tenders took more than an hour to put out the blaze. No one was injured. A part of the stock in the factory was destroyed. The cause of the fire was yet to be ascertained.    A 28-year-old Sri Lankan national was caught boarding a Dubai-bound flight at Calcutta airport late on Saturday with a forged Indian passport. Sashidharan Vallipuram, who had been staying in Tiruchirapalli since 2007, had applied for a Canadian visa which was not granted to him. He later managed the fake Indian passport through a tout and a visa for Peru.    Several parts of the city received light rain late on Sunday evening. This was preceded by gusty winds for a couple of hours. The monsoon, which arrived a fortnight ahead in Bengal on May 25, hasnt advanced over the week.

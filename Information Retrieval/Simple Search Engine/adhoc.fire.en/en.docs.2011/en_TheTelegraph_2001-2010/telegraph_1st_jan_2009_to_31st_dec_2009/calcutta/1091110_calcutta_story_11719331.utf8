	Easy advice on advertising strategy, an opportunity to bag free creatives and the chance to walk away with advertising packages.        
	This and much more is on offer at the week-long Printworks expo organised by Anandabazar Patrika and The Telegraph at the Royal Bengal Room in City Centre.        
	The one-stop shop for advertising needs which opened on Monday aims to introduce small and medium enterprises to the power of advertising through the print media.        
	The idea is to make print advertising as simple as ABC. Its about choosing the appropriate environment, the best market coverage and deciding on the advertisement size that best suits the purpose and the budget, said veteran actor Barun Chanda, who was the master of ceremony.        
	The expo  hosting 54 business categories and nine environments (sections), including travel and entertainment, education, lifestyle and motoring  has something for every kind of business. Its good to have so much information in one place, said Parvana Babaycon of Optimum Image Institute, a participant.

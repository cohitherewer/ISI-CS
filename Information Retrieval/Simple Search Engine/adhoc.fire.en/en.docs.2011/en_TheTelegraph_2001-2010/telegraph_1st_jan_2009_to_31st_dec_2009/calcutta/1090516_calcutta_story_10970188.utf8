                                                                                                               Library battered amp; bruised
          A STAFF REPORTER                          An ornate lamp lining the library staircase now bites the dust thanks to the poll army. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                  
	The ballot battle has left National Library battered and bruised, with ornate lamps broken, flowerpots smashed and patches of grass scorched by makeshift kitchen fires.        
	Four of the six lamps that line the wide staircase on the northern side of the main building were broken, with one knocked off its perch and lying on the ground behind a pile of rubbish, and the lampshades of three smashed beyond repair.        
	At least three of the large earthen flowerpots in front of the staircase lay in fragments with some plants strangled by the giant pandal.        
	Cooking started around 11am on Friday in one corner of the pandal, till complaints from the National Library Staff Association to director K.K. Banerjee forced the flames to be doused. But not before the grounds had been scarred.        
	The pandals were being dismantled but the ground was littered with plastic cups, water bottles, food wrappers and plastic bags.        
	Against this backdrop of damage, chief electoral officer Debashis Sen met director Banerjee on Friday and promised clean-up, repair and restoration.        
	They will clear the place and replace whatever has been damaged. We will not give them a clearance till we are satisfied. The CEO said the contractors employed by the commission will not be paid till then, said Banerjee.

	The 300sq ft Tangra shanty gutted in Monday nights fire had been manufacturing katatel since 2006 and had stocked enough fuel to blow up the neighbourhood.         
	The 4 Pagoldanga Road unit, a 10-minute walk from Tangra police station, caught fire while various kinds of fuel were being mixed to manufacture katatel, which powers two-stroke autos plying in the city flouting a high court ban. Twenty fire engines doused the flames in four hours. Asri Devi, the landlady, was arrested.        
	Residents of the area claimed Beleghata-resident Shyamal Das ran the unit but there was no confirmation from the police.        
	According to fire services officers, the stock of fuel in the shanty was enough to blow up everything within 250 metres. Only one drum of fuel exploded. Had all the drums exploded the bustee around the unit might have been gutted, said divisional fire officer Uday Narayan Adhikari.         
	We found about 50 drums of kerosene, diesel, petroleum, solvent and lubricants stacked on one another in the shanty, said Adhikari.         
	The three rooms on the premises were being used to manufacture katatel since 2006, said Basu Das, a 30-year-old worker at the unit. He was admitted to NRS hospital with burns. A three-year-old girl who lives in the shanty next door was also injured.        
	The owner of the unit used to bribe the cops. We would make katatel all day and sell it in jerrycans every morning. Katatel dealers in suburbs also used to buy from us, added Das. The cops refused comment.        
	Dharmendra Malakar, a 26-year-old resident of a house near the unit, said flames reached up to 30ft and the heat cracked the window panes of neighbouring buildings. Firemen arrived within 15 minutes and started work. If they were late, the entire place would have blown up, he added.

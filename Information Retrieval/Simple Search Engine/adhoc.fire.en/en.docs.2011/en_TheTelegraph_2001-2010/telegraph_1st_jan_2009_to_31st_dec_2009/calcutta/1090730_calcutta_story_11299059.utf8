The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cops protest phone slur
                                                                                                               Cops protest phone slur
          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	A batch of around 200 constables of the fifth battalion refused to join duty on Wednesday afternoon demanding an apology from a senior police officer who had allegedly thrown away a colleagues cellphone on Tuesday.         
	The no-work call left around 30 installations across the city unprotected for over an hour till the deputy commissioner of police overseeing the battalion, Bhuban Mondal, intervened and persuaded the constables to return to work.         
	On Tuesday afternoon, constable Idrish Ansari was on duty near the AIR building off Eden Gardens when assistant commissioner of police from the fifth battalion, Pronob Kumar Ghosh, arrived at the spot on his usual rounds.         
	The officer alleged that Ansari was talking on his cellphone and continued speaking even when he saw his senior. Incensed at the constables indiscipline, Ghosh snatched the cellphone from Ansari and flung it on the ground, smashing it.         
	Ansari later claimed he was calling up a colleague who had gone to relieve himself to inform him that their senior had arrived on the spot.         
	When Ansari narrated the incident to the others in his batch, they became furious and decided not to join duty on Wednesday afternoon unless the officer tendered an apology, a source told Metro.         
	Deputy commissioner Mondal intervened and the constables returned to work after an hour. I was at Lalbazar at the moment and had to rush back to my battalion. I spoke to the agitated constables and they calmed down and returned to work. This is a departmental thing and I wouldnt like to go into details, Mondal said.        
	The deputy commissioner concerned has been asked to probe the allegation against Ghosh and submit a report. Depending on the veracity of the claims, we will decide on our course of action, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner (headquarters).

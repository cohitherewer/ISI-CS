The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Motorists trip on trash
                                                                                                               Motorists trip on trash
          ONTHESPOT - SP MUKHERJEE ROAD-KALIGHAT PARK (S)                          Garbage from the vat at the crossing of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Road and Kalighat Park (South) spills over to both roads. Pictures by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                  
	A large vat at the crossing of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Road and Kalighat Park (South) has become a nuisance for pedestrians, motorists and local residents. An overpowering stench hangs in the air as garbage from the vat spills on both roads, taking up more than half the road space.         
	On August 27, when Metro visited the spot, garbage covered three-quarters of the carriageway at the point where the two roads intersect. The trash had not been cleared since the day before and vehicles were forced to take a wide turn from Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Road to Kalighat Park (South) to avoid running into the garbage. Drivers of two-wheelers and cyclists ran the risk of slipping at the turn.         
	If this is the condition when garbage is not cleared for one day, just imagine what happens if it is not cleared for three to four days at a stretch, said Dilip Sonkar, a local resident.         
	Right beside the vat there are garages and bag-making units on both sides of Kalighat Park (South). Sushanta Halder, a local shop owner, said: After Aila, the garbage was not cleared for three days. The stench was unbearable. We spend long hours at work and have our meals here too. With garbage strewn all around, there could easily be an outbreak of some disease.        
	Pedestrians walking down Shyamaprasad Mukherjee Road too appeared angry at the apathy of the civic authorities. Whenever I cross this stretch, I am forced to walk on the carriageway, said a student of Asutosh College, who was headed for Rashbehari Avenue.                         A pedestrian holds his breath as he passes the vat and (above) a car can barely cross Kalighat Park (South) 
  as overflowing garbage takes up most of the carriageway      
	Local residents said two-wheelers often skid at the turn. Since garbage accumulates at the turn, the spot becomes very slippery. Those who are not familiar with the stretch often skid when they try to negotiate the turn without slowing down, said Haldar.         
	Anup Chatterjee, the local councillor, admitted that the overflowing vat was a problem in the area. There is only one vat for the entire ward. Besides, garbage from Lake Market and Kalighat are also dumped here, said Chatterjee. The civic staff dump the garbage inside the vat when it is empty. But when the vat fills up, they dump it on the road. I will ask them not to do so, he added.        
	After the high court directive on phasing out 15-year-old commercial vehicles, many dumpers of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) had to be pulled off the road. This is affecting the work of the civic body, said Chatterjee.         
	A senior official of the solid waste management department of CMC said the civic body had engaged an agency to clear the garbage since the ban came into effect.         
	We spray bleaching powder to prevent spread of diseases and to control the stench. Generally, three to four trips by a dumper are enough to clear the garbage. But if the dumper fails to make even one trip, then the garbage starts rotting, he explained.         
	About accidents on the stretch, he said: We did not receive any complaint about the intersection becoming slippery, but we will clean the road.

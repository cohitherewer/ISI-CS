The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Money hurdle in medical dream
                                                                                                               Money hurdle in medical dream
  - Landless labourers son cracks JEE but fears funds crunch will end quest          SANJAY MANDAL                          CROSSROADS: Kaushik Biswas.   (Sanat Kumar Sinha)                                              
	A 19-year-old who studied by the light of a kerosene lamp to crack JEE is seeing darkness descend on his dream of becoming a doctor. He has the marks but not the money to study medicine.        
	My parents are poor. I have come this far after a lot of struggle, but my career is now at the crossroads, said Kaushik Biswas, who ranked 282 in the reserved category of this years JEE (medical) and aspires to be a neurologist.        
	Dreams have driven the boy from Tangra Colony in Bongaon, North 24-Parganas, to fight the odds at every stage of his life. His father Kulada Nanda Biswas is a landless daily wage-earner while mother Chandra earns around Rs 1,500 a month working for an NGO. Elder brother Kalyan did not study beyond graduation because the family could no longer fund his education.        
	Kaushik dreads being forced by circumstance to give up studies like his brother did.        
	When I was preparing for my Higher Secondary, three teachers helped me with books and guidance. I also worked in other peoples fields to earn money, but getting to medical college is a tougher financial challenge, said Kaushik.        
	Besides a one-time payment of Rs 6,500  it includes the admission fee, caution money for library and laboratory facilities, and six months fees in advance  a student of a state-run medical college has to pay around Rs 2,000 every month. Counselling for students who have cleared JEE (medical) is scheduled to start next month, and each passing day sees Kaushik become more jittery about his prospects of going to medical college.        
	He needs help, and fast. When he first took the entrance test last year, Kaushik was too busy giving tuitions to study. We encouraged him to take the JEE a second time because he has the potential, said Sumit Kumar Saha, who tutored him for free.        
	Having proved his potential with a decent JEE ranking, the boy from Bongaon now needs more than just a little encouragement to break through the final barrier.

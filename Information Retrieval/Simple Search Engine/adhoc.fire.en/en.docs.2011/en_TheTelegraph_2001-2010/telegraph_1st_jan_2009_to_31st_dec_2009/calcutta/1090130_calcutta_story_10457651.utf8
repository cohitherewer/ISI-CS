The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Green light turns amber for Haldiram return
                                                                                                               Green light turns amber for Haldiram return
  - Fire department reviews clearance given to outlet as cylinder count sparks fear of disaster          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                                                  
	The state fire services department is reviewing its decision to allow the reopening of the Haldiram outlet at the Exide crossing, which has remained shut since November 19 when it was ravaged by a third fire in three years.        
	The fate of the popular vegetarian eatery hangs fire, with an official stating that the department had erred in issuing the original fire licence by allowing the outlet to use as many as 128 gas cylinders at such a strategic location.        
	Advocate-general Balai Ray, appearing for the state, told the high court on Thursday: Our initial decision to allow the restaurant-cum-sweet shop to run a big kitchen was wrong. So, the fire services department is reconsidering its decision to allow the outlet to operate from its present premises.        
	Justice Sanjeev Banerjee, hearing a petition filed by Haldiram owner Mahesh Agarwal seeking an order to allow the reopening of the outlet, asked Ray to file an affidavit stating the governments stand. The next hearing is scheduled for February 3.        
	An official in the fire services department said the affidavit would mention the possibility of a disaster at a vital intersection if there was a blast in the kitchen.        
	Agarwal had moved the court on January 20, accusing the police of holding back their approval for the reopening of the outlet even after the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and the fire department had given their nod.        
	The civic body had informed the court two weeks ago that the outlet could reopen. The fire department, too, had expressed satisfaction over the safety measures put in place since the November blast. But the police are still preventing us from resuming business, the Haldiram lawyer said.        
	The court had asked the company to make the CMC a party to the case and posted the matter for hearing on Thursday.        
	CMC lawyer Alok Ghosh informed the court that his client had issued a licence to the company following the fire departments nod. Our licence is subject to the fire departments approval.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Count shocker in gas chamber city
                                                                                                               Count shocker in gas chamber city

	Respirable Particulate Matter on March 23: 135 microgram per cubic metre of air (measured by a manual station)        
	Respirable Particulate Matter on March 23: 358 microgram per cubic metre of air (measured by an automatic station)        
	National permissible standard: 200 microgram per cubic metre of air        
	Calcutta is far more polluted than what official figures have so far revealed.    
	Forget the saplings being planted and the tokenisms being offered on World Environment Day, what matters is that Calcutta as a gas chamber is even worse than what we know it to be. And neither the government nor the Opposition is bothered about the air we are forced to breathe.        
	The data the government releases at regular intervals  collected from 18 manual measurement stations across the city  show that the annual average respirable particulate matter (RPM) in the citys air is 1.5 times the national permissible limit.        
	But the figures sourced by Metro from the two automatic stations in the city  in the Rabindra Bharati University compound on BT Road and on the Victoria Memorial premises  prove why Calcutta is actually the pollution, and respirable diseases, capital of the country.        
	Data from the university station reveal that the presence of RPM  fine particles that enter the crevices of the lungs and cause irreversible damage  is almost four times the national standard.        
	Based on the manual figures, Calcutta is rated Indias second most polluted metro, after Delhi. But readings from the automatic stations suggest that Calcutta is the most polluted metro, said Arun Biswas, an environment expert earlier associated with the Pune-based National Environment Engineering Research Institute (NEERI).        
	What this means is even more health horror for a coughing, wheezing Calcutta where the government and the Opposition are united in their bid to allow polluting vehicles a free run on the streets.        
	The figures are a big cause for concern. The high RPM count in the air is a key factor triggering lung cancer, chronic bronchitis, acute respiratory infection and asthma, said pulmonologist A.G. Ghosal.        
	Sources in the environment department said the readings of automatic stations  installed by the pollution control board in 2004  have been consistently higher than even those manual stations that are closest to them.        
	Take the March 23 readings. The RPM recorded by the university station on March 23 was 358. The Ultadanga station, 2km from the university, recorded only 135 RPM from 6am on March 23 to 6am on March 24, said an official of the pollution control board.        
	The same is true for the Victoria Memorial station. Despite the green cover, the automatic gadget recorded 154 RPM on March 24. The reading at the nearest manual station, at Minto Park, between 6am on March 24 and 6am on March 25 was 76.        
	The disparity in the figures and the worldwide acceptance of automatic stations have prompted experts, within the government and outside, to call for the abolition of the manual system.        
	Data derived from manual assessment do not seem to be reliable, admitted a pollution control board official.        
	Advanced countries have long switched to automatic mode. Bangladesh is following suit. But we are still sticking to the manual measurement, said an expert.        
	Some environmentalists, however, blame men more than machines for the flawed data.         
	Look at the manual reading near the Dunlop crossroads, one of the most polluted in the city. The figure  99 on March 25  points at untrained hands operating the gadget, said an expert.        
	Anjali Srivastava, the regional director of NEERI, said: The manual method of measuring air pollution is credible only if you deploy trained personnel and follow the proper methodology.        
	Environment activist Subhash Dutta sees the gap between the manual and automatic data as a deliberate move to suppress the truth about Calcuttas foul air. I had raised the issue in the high court once and I will do it again, he said.

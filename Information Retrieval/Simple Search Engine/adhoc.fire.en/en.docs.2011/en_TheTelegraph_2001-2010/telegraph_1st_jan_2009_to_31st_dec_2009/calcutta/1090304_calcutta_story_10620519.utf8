          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta High Court on Tuesday directed the state government to file an affidavit stating what action had been taken against the teacher of Vidya Bharati School in Mominpur who has been accused of slapping a Class II student, resulting in her death.        
	Yoga teacher Anita Das had allegedly slapped eight-year-old Iftesham Chowdhury so hard on November 27 that she lost her balance and hit her head against the wall.        
	The girl died a day later of cerebral haematoma.        
	The court also asked the government to state whether it was considering paying reasonable compensation to the parents of the child.        
	Justice Sanjib Banerjee issued the directive after admitting a petition by Ifteshams parents Mansur Rahman and Nazneen seeking compensation and a CBI probe.

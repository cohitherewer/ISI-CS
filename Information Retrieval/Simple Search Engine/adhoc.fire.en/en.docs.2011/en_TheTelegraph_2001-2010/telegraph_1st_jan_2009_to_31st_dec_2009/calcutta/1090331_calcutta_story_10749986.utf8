	Increasing awareness and reaching out to caregivers should be the agenda for this Autism Awareness Day, says consultant Krishna Roy        
	April 2 will be like most summer days at this time of year. But for some, it is the day that brings hope and rejuvenates sagging morale. It will be Autism Awareness Day, an occasion meant to foster understanding of people living with autism.         
	In our country, most are ignorant about the disorder. But autistic people should have the same rights as everyone else in society.         Guidelines for teachers  
	Parents of children with autism and Aspergers Syndrome live under constant threat of having their child expelled from mainstream schools.         
	When this happens, many find it too heartbreaking to accept. There have even been instances of nervous breakdown.         
	A few musts for teachers and facilitators working with autistic children:         
	 Teachers dealing with autistic children are often not confident about their own abilities. But they need to educate themselves about the disease and be pro-active so that plans are implemented and assessments carried out regularly.         
	Partnership between school and home should become a mainstream school policy and make inclusive education, where normal and autistic children study together, a success.         
	 Teachers should provide ample opportunities to develop communication skills through mind training. This teaches autistic individuals to recognise mental states in oneself and others.         
	 They should create situations that help the children develop social attention. This will enable them to focus on objects, people and places. Visual aids are helpful in eliciting communication and comprehension.         
	It is a myth that parents of autistic children can automatically become better special educators because of their experience.         
	Each child has unique characteristics. They demonstrate situation-specific behaviour. A general checklist on autism will not do justice for an intervention programme.         
	Young adults with Aspergers Syndrome may be able to speak but still have problems processing language. A facilitator must have years of experience to be able to cater to their needs.         
	A few autistic children are enjoying their mainstream school environment where teachers show empathy and understand the difficulties of these children.         
	Over the years, I have seen several happy instances of children who have benefited from studying in inclusive schools. One such instance is of an autistic boy, now a young adult, who has acquired a few social norms after 10 years in an inclusive school.         
	Though protected under the inclusion umbrella at school, he will find it difficult to function in the outside world.         
	For people have little or no knowledge about the challenges of autism. The world is not yet ready to receive autistic adults with open arms.         
	April 2 is earmarked as the day for campaigning about autism populations all over the world. An ordinary person will find it difficult to understand why a six-year-old girl should relish a tube of Boroline fished out from her caregivers bag, lap up a balm or fungal ointment as happily as if she were eating jam.         
	It is important not to ignore the following signs in a child. They may be early signs of developmental disorders.        
	 Speech and communication delay        
	 Lack of reciprocal communication like waving goodbye or smiling back        
	 Lack of eye contact        
	 Difficulty in indicating the need to urinate        
	 Sudden loss of acquired skills.         
	On April 2, we should take a pledge to become more aware about autism. It is time to stop looking at autistic people as if they are aliens from another planet.         
	Instead, we must help caregivers who deal with it every day. For, it could happen in your family, too.

	Fun n learn basket                   Learning and laughter go together at a Pitara lesson    
	A group of five-year-olds listened in rapt attention to the story of the president ghost that haunts the US White House. The teacher asked who this president was. Abraham Lincoln being the right answer, the class proceeded to discuss his achievements, moving on to later US presidents up to Barrack Obama.         
	This was a Pitara class in session. The word pitara means basket in Hindi, referring to our concept of providing wholesome education, explains Vidhi Banka, director of Pitaras city branch. Kids learn more by interaction, story-telling and games than by mugging up information, she adds.         
	Each class starts with a prayer, followed by a yoga session. Then, the students watch animated stories from Indian mythology, like tales from The Ramayana.         
	A question- and-answer session on the tale later, they delve into mathematics puzzles like Sudoku.         
	Exercises to complete simple poems help brush up language skills. The day ends with the chanting of Vedic hymns.         
	Located in Alipore, the classes, for kids between five to14 years, are held on Saturdays. Pitara, with centres in Ahmedabad, Surat, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Chennai, started in Calcutta in January with 28 children.         
	Nine-year old Mahek Daga of Loreto House loves her Pitara classes. There are so many new things to learn. I have also made friends with students from other schools, she says. Suchi Ajitsaria thinks it is a good way for her son Siddharth to utilise his term break.         
	The teaching method is tailored to fit the individuals needs. Some pick up fast with audio-visuals, others respond better to movements or group discussions, points out Banka. Identifying the learning techniques of each child is useful in identifying those with learning difficulties.         
	The fees for the course is Rs 3,500, along with Rs 250 for registering online.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Dry day, the festive forecast
                                                                                                               Dry day, the festive forecast
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Diwali is likely to be warm and humid, with the weather office ruling out chances of heavy showers despite the occasional cloud cover.        
	In the absence of any formation over south Bengal or the Bay of Bengal, the weather on Diwali will be the same as the past few days, said an official in the Regional Meteorological Centre, Alipore.        
	The condition is likely to persist for the next three-four days, he added.        
	The official attributed the high humidity over the past few days to the cloud cover and a lack of precipitation.         
	On Friday, the discomfort index was 63 degrees Celsius, eight points above normal.        
	The conditions during the day were generally sticky, with the temperature ranging between 31.3 and 25.1 degrees Celsius.

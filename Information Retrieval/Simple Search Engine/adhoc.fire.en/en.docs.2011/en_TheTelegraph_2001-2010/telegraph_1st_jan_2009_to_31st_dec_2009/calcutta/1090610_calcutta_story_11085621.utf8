                      A hallucinatory world of the grotesque                    Distortion, at times, produces absurd and repulsive images, evolving from the grotesque. Grotesque was meant to be didactic in nature. Borrowing the hideous amplification of the grotesque, Arghya Priya Majumdar criticises the follies of society by presenting an exaggerated immorality as truth. In his universe, all aspects of life are equal, the grotesque is as important as the beautiful and the ideal is revealed as comical. His works rely on an understanding of normal perception, but subvert the expectations of ordinary reality. The intellectual pleasure of comprehending these distortions is generic and successfully addresses a broad audience. His works challenge the boundaries of art: transgressing, merging, overflowing and destabilising them. Young Mahjabin Majumdars enigmatic artistic visions, on the other hand, succeed in alternately amusing, enchanting and puzzling the viewer with their juxtapositions and metamorphoses of imagery which centre on the bizarre and incongruous. She attempts to establish a parallel world, strange yet oddly familiar, ruled by imagination that is ambiguous, juxtaposing the duality of life and death, conformity and contradiction. The hallucinatory quality of her works invokes a world of the eerie and the fantastic. A joint exhibition of their recent works, titled Outsiders Within, is currently on view.

                                                                                                               Days spent dreading next power cut
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	The power situation worsened on Wednesday following the collapse of a 210-MW unit at the state-run Bandel power plant because of a snag that occurred late on Tuesday.        
	The city sweated out the day under a combined assault of heat and humidity as the energy shortfall ranged between 70 and 195MW, resulting in rotational power cuts stretching up to two hours.        
	Officials said the supply would improve from Friday, by when a unit each at Sagardighi and Bakreswar facilities are expected to generate full steam, but did not rule out power cuts.        
	CESC sources said Wednesdays power cuts could have been for longer stretches had the utility not saved 40MW by suspending supply to industrial units in Howrah, Hooghly and North 24-Parganas for around 45 minutes.        
	We did this to provide some relief to our domestic consumers. The evening shortfall for domestic consumers could be restricted to 155MW because of the rotational power cuts in the industrial zones, said a CESC official.        
	The demand shot up to 1,498MW in the evening but the West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Limited could not supply more than 409MW to supplement CESCs output of around 900MW. The situation was worse in the districts where power cuts continued for five to six hours as the distribution company grappled with a demand of 3,500MW.         
	Power secretary Sunil Mitra said all state-run plants had been asked to step up production.        
	Unable to bear the heat and humidity, many residents in areas affected by power cuts were forced to spend the evening on pavements or in neighbourhood parks. Barir bhetore aar thaka jachche na (We could no longer stay indoors). The worst sufferers are the children, said Mohua Roy, sitting outside her house in Kankurgachhi.        
	Many demanded that CESC announce a loadshedding schedule. We should be told beforehand when the supply is likely to be disrupted. Otherwise we are spending days and nights dreading the next power cut, said Priti Chaturvedi, a resident of Shyambazar.        
	Three poll officials undergoing training at Barrackpore fell ill in the afternoon and had to be hospitalised. Doctors said all three, in their early 50s, were dehydrated. More than 600 officials at another training camp nearby did not attend a session citing excessive heat.

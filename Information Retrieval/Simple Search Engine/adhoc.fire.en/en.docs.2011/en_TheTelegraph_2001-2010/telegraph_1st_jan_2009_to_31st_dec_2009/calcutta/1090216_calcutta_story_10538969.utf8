The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Year-long makeover for maidan
                                                                                                               Year-long makeover for maidan

	The Park Circus Maidan will sport a new look by March next year. The uneven tracks around the ground will make way for concrete paths for morning and evening-walkers, Victoria Memorial-like fencing will come up on all sides and the entire surface of the playground will be re-laid.        
	The project for the facelift of the Park Circus Maidan, which had been gathering dust for the past two years for various reasons, is finally underway. Work started last week and the formal announcement was made on Saturday.         
	The beautification of Park Circus Maidan will change the face of the neighbourhood. Beautification of the ground has become a necessity, especially with it lying on an important connector to the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya at the inauguration of the project.        
	The makeover by the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project will cost Rs 2.15 crore, of which Rs 2 crore has been sanctioned by the Asian Development Bank.        
	In terms of generating revenue, the Park Circus Maidan is at the top of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) list. But civic boards have always ignored it. No major renovation was ever carried out here, said Faiyaz Ahmed Khan, the mayoral council member for parks and gardens.         
	One of the reasons the makeover couldnt be started earlier is that the ground was rented out for various events.         
	The ailing nursery on the ground will be revived as part of the project. Flowers and plants will be sold through counters, which will be built on the side facing Lady Brabourne College.        
	There will also be an ice-cream parlour. The funds generated from these outlets will be utilised for day-to-day maintenance of the park, said Faiyaz.        
	Residents of Park Circus and neighbouring areas have welcomed the decision to start the renovation.        
	Park Circus Maidan is the only open space in the area. Because of increase in vehicular pollution and negligence by the CMC, it had started to resemble a garbage dump. The residents are happy that the beautification work has finally started, said Bimal Chatterjee, the secretary of the Park Circus and Darga Road Residents Association.

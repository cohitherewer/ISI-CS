The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Weekend rain relief on radar
                                                                                                               Weekend rain relief on radar
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The spell of sweltering heat post-Aila is likely to end this weekend, with the Met office predicting heavy rainfall over the next 24-48 hours.        
	Scattered but heavy rain is likely in most places in Gangetic Bengal, including Calcutta and its neighbouring areas, in the next 24 to 48 hours, said a senior official at the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.        
	The rain will drag down the mercury. The humidity, which has been causing considerable discomfort over the past few days, will also come down, he added.        
	Fridays maximum humidity was 94 per cent. The minimum rose by 4 per cent from Thursdays 62 to settle at 66 per cent. The discomfort index was 67 degrees, 12 degrees above normal.        
	The prediction of weekend rain is based on the formation of convective cloud, a typical phenomenon during the monsoon which had raced into the state on Monday, a fortnight ahead of schedule, powered by the cyclone.        
	The monsoon  which has covered much of the state since Monday  is unlikely to advance further over the next four to five days.        
	Numerical prediction models indicate the monsoon will not travel much in the next four-five days. But there should be consistently heavy rainfall, a characteristic of the monsoon in these parts, from early next week, said the official.        
	Much of the monsoons initial energy was devoured by Aila. That explains the unusually subdued start.        
	The city did not receive any rain on Friday. The maximum temperature was 33.1 degree Celsius, two degrees below normal.

  - Sons protest at SSKM leads to hurried correction and surgery          A STAFF REPORTER                          Promila Dey at SSKM Hospital on Thursday. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha                                        
	A 94-year-old woman who had fractured her right leg got a traction in the left, courtesy a junior doctor at SSKM Hospital.        
	After Promila Deys son Rupayan protested against the goof-up on Thursday afternoon, the hospital authorities wheeled her back into the reduction room and set the other leg, too, in traction. Another round of avoidable agony awaited the aged lady in the evening when the implant in the wrong leg was surgically removed.         
	Medical superintendent Ashok Ghosh said the procedure on both legs were performed by Surajit Kundu, a member of the house staff. A probe has been ordered to find out whether Kundu had performed it on his own or was asked to by orthopaedic surgeon Samar Gupta, under whom the patient was admitted. If found guilty, the doctors would be show-caused, said Ghosh.        
	Rupayan, an official of the state human rights commission, has lodged an FIR against the doctors.        
	Dey slipped and fell at her New Ballygunge home on Wednesday morning. She was taken to the biggest state-run referral hospital, where an X-ray revealed that she had broken her right femur bone. Doctors said she would need a traction.         
	My mother was admitted to Woodburn ward under Gupta. I bought all the traction materials and handed them over to the hospital staff, said Rupayan.        
	Dey was taken to the reduction room for the procedure around 1.30pm.                    
	 quot;I immediately went to the medical superintendent and lodged a complaint. When I returned around half an hour later, I was surprised to find both her legs in traction, quot; recalled Rupayan, who later lodged an FIR against Gupta and Kundu.                             
	Superintendent Ghosh said: quot;The doctors apparently committed a mistake. They should have been more careful during the procedure. quot;                             
	Experts said the incision in the left leg could lead to an infection and further complications. quot;At this age, it takes a long time for an injury to heal. The protocol is to put an indelible mark on the fractured leg to ensure there is no mistake. It was apparently not followed in this case, quot; said a senior orthopaedic surgeon.                             
	The goof-up has a name in the medical profession  wrong site surgery. quot;Such surgeries, causing immense unnecessary pain to patients, are not unheard of. Occasionally, we do get reports of a surgeon operating on the wrong eye or leg or kidney, quot; said a healthcare expert.

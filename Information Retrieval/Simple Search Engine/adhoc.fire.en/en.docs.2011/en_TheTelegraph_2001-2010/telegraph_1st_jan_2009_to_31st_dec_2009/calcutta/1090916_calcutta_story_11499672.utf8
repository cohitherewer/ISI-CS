The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | More arms in Vedic Village
                                                                                                               More arms in Vedic Village
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	More arms and ammunition were found in Gaffar Mollahs office in Vedic Village on Tuesday.        
	Four country-made one shots, a 8mm live cartridge, six crude bombs and six helmets were in the room, said a senior district police officer.        
	The raid was conducted on the basis of leads provided by Mollah and his aides.         
	Gaffar told us that he used the room where the weapons were found as his office. He met his aides in the room and also summoned unwilling farmers there to threaten them. Thats why he used to keep arms and ammunition in the chamber, said an officer of Rajarhat police station who took part in the raid.         
	The room is right next to project manager Biplab Biswass office. The arms haul is definitely going to make the case against Gaffar, Biplab and Vedic Village owner Raj Modi stronger, added the officer.        
	On August 25, police had seized guns, bombs, helmets and other tools of intimidation from a labour hutment in Vedic Village.        
	We will conduct more raids in Vedic Village and Gaffars other hideouts in North 24-Parganas, said another officer.

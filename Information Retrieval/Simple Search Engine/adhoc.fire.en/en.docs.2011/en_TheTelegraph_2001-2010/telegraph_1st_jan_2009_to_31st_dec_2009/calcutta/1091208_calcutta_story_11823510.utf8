	Four government employees and a bank staffer are set to mount in April the first joint attempt from Bengal in 10 years on the worlds highest peak.        
	The five from the Mountaineering Association of Krishnagar  four of them work in the city  would attempt to climb the Mt Everest from the China side, considered tougher than the more-frequently taken route through Nepal.         
	The last successful attempt on the peak from Bengal was by Shipra Majumdar, who was part of a 2005 Indian army womens expedition.        
	Last year, constable Gautam Ghosh of Calcutta police participated in a Nehru Institute of Mountaineering team expedition but had to return midway after injuries sustained in an avalanche.         
	Debasish Biswas and I will try to summit, while Sourav Sinchan Mondal, Bivas Sarkar and Asok Roy, who will form the support team, will stay at the advanced base camp at 21,000ft on East Rongbuk glacier, says Basanta Singha Roy, the leader of the proposed expedition. He is an experienced mountaineer with 18 successful peak summits.         
	The expedition, expected to take about 65 days, will start from Rongbuk glacier in Tibet. Biswas says: The toughest part will be the final leg from the summit camp to the peak that falls within the Death Zone, where the oxygen available is not enough to sustain life.        
	The age of the team members ranges from 35 to 54. The advanced age of some members does not daunt Singha Roy, who at 47, is one of the oldest.        
	We are all physically fit as we have all been going for expeditions every year, says Singha Roy, who was part of the group from his club that in 2008 climbed Mt Thalay Sagar, which, according to experts, demands more technical expertise than the Everest.         
	The teams budget is Rs 40 lakh, about half of which the members will raise on their own. To take the decision of climbing Everest was tough, because of the risks involved as well as the expenses, says Singha Roy, who like the others, is from a modest financial background.        
	The Punjab National Bank employee plans to take a loan for the expedition. Members of the club who are not part of the expedition are also chipping in. We are looking for sponsorships to raise the rest of the amount, adds Singha Roy.

                                                                                                               Assault duo bail
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The condition of Manoj Kumar Singh, who was beaten up by four attendants of Medical College and Hospital for soiling his bed on Sunday night, worsened on Monday. Family members said he was still traumatised.        
	The condition has deteriorated and may turn critical, said a doctor.        
	Srikanta Dolui and Ranjan, who were arrested for the assault, were released on bail on Tuesday. The hospital authorities had on Monday said the duo were Group D employees. But on Tuesday, superintendent Anup Roy said they were hired by family members of the patients and were not authorised to work in the hospital.        
	The 26-year-old was admitted in the medicine ward of the hospital two weeks ago with Hepatitis B and some related complications. The ailments left him so weak that he could not move about without support.        
	On Sunday night, Manoj defecated on the bed after his pleas to the attendants to help him to the toilet fell on deaf years. Later, when four attendants spotted the soiled bed, with Manoj lying on it, they beat him up severely.

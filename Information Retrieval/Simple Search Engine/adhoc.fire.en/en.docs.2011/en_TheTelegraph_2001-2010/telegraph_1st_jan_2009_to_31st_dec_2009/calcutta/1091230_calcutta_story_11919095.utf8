             BARE TRUTHS: Apropos the question What according to you were the top trends of Christmas Eve 2009? (December 26) I feel SYBs (smart young boys) were dressed traditionally in jeans and polo-neck shirts but PYTs (pretty young things) dared to bare despite it being the coldest Christmas Eve in a decade. Noodle straps, halter necks and, of course, a short hemline were the order of the evening. (Above: the Christmas Eve party at Tollygunge Club. Picture by Anindya Shankar Ray)

	Apropos Where have all the pavements gone?, October 26, politically patronised hawkers are not the sole offenders on the citys pavements. Most fast food stalls on Bhupen Bose Avenue, on the stretch between the Shyambazar five-point crossing and Shyambazar Metro station, show scant regard for municipal rules and citizens rights. Some even use the roadside railing as shelves for keeping utensils. During peak hours, pedestrians are jostled along the crowded and narrowed thoroughfare. Is it not the CMCs responsibility to rein in such violaters?             
	Anupam Sett,
  Gopal Chatterjee Road           
	Most of the roads near Lalbazar have been forcibly occupied by Calcutta police for parking police vehicles. One would find hundreds of police vehicles parked on both sides of RN Mukherjee Road, Bentinck Street, Rabindra Sarani and Radhabazar Street. At some places, police vehicles are parked in double lines. Incidentally, most of these vehicles are not required regularly. Instead of choking the central business district, police should park such vehicles in a garage.           
	Raj Bagri,
  Ho Chi Minh Sarani                               
	It is unfortunate that the West Bengal government considered it a boost when it received a request from Wipro for 50 acres at a concession (Wipro tables bid for Rajarhat plot, October 31). Wipro is not a BPL (below poverty line) company and does not need subsidy/concession. What the IT major needs from Bengal is a steady work culture, discipline, good infrastructure, satisfied local people, law and order and efficient and honest administration. Since these are absent in Bengal, the government is offering subsidy on land to woo industries. It would be better if the state stressed on developing the above-mentioned parameters and also took action to properly compensate land losers.             
	Hara Lal Chakraborty,
  Arabinda Nagar                       
	Apropos the report Red tape keeps youth in jail, October 26, I would like to ask: what about Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees mantra do it now? On September 22, the high court ordered the Presidency jail authorities to release lifer Amal Mazumder as he had been acquitted of the charge of abetting his wifes suicide.             
	But the order was not executed even after 34 days. The work culture in various government departments has deteriorated because of the sluggish attitude and corruption of a majority of the employees. The chief minister recently advised panchayat employees to discharge their duties impartially. Let us see whether they pay any heed.           
	Asok Kumar Chatterjee,
  Konnagar, Hooghly                               
	A girl student of Jadavpur University was slashed on campus (Stalk-and-slash security scan, November 5). The report left us wondering how such an incident could take place in an institution where over 60 security personnel are deployed. The incident spoke of the lackadaisical attitude of the university authorities regarding the safety of its students and staff.             
	P.B. Saha,
  Salt Lake                     
	The incident at JU reflects on the work culture of employees of most city colleges and universities. On Calcutta University campuses, the guards are either dozing or busy chatting. They know they will receive their salaries at the end of the month. Educational institutions in Calcutta anyway have a pitiable reputation all over the country, thanks to the constant migration of students. Incidents like the one at JU would reinforce the poor perception. But when the state government is busy trying to save its crown, does it have time for matters like campus security?           
	Amrita Mallik,
  Salt Lake                               
	The report Legs crushed, dash to five hospitals, November 7, underscores the woeful condition of healthcare in India. A 21-year-old accident victim was made to run around from hospital to hospital for a whole night with crushed legs, for want of money. The action of the hospitals and doctors who saw the serious injuries of the patient but refused to take steps must be deemed as one of the worst forms of medical crime.             
	The Hippocratic Oath stipulates that physicians must treat ailing people first, without consideration for financial gain. Unfortunately, the commercialisation of medicine has eroded moral values.           
	However, refusing emergency medical care is also against the law. Article 21 of the Constitution guarantees the right of life and liberty to all citizens. Consumers courts and the Supreme Court have also repeatedly asserted that a patient cannot be denied treatment when brought to the emergency ward. Even the Medical Council of India has mandated the same view in Section 1 of its Code of Ethics and Regulations for all doctors in India.           
	Kunal Saha,
  Ohio, US                               
	Apropos the report Shes Our Mother, October 26, it is perplexing to learn that the Albanian government claimed Mother Teresas remains. Mother Teresa lived in India and worked for the ailing and the destitute here. She is held in high esteem by millions of Indians. Thus, Albanias claim for her remains is bizarre and unethical.             
	Prahlad Agarwala,
  Majdia, Nadia                               
	Apropos Some listen some dont, October 31, it was heartening to know that the Election Commission had decided not to take over National Library during the bypolls since the readers had suffered when the premises were used for the Lok-Sabha elections.             
	On the other hand, it was disappointing that chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee addressed a rally in the city centre on a working day.           
	The Supreme Court should keep vigil on such illegal political activities organised by high-level administrators. They have no right to prevent people from going to work and robbing daily wage-earners of a days earnings.           
	Sukumar Ghosh,
  Mukundapur                               
	It is alarming that a racket is engaged in selling fake arms licences in the city and its surrounding areas (Firearms bought with fake licence, October 26).

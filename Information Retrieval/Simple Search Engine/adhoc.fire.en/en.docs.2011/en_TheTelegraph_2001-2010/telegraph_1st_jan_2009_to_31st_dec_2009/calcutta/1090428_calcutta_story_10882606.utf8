                      Portraying human personality                    Judging from an art historical perspective, it is not difficult to recognise that Sarbari Roy Choudhury stands out among those who came onto the Indian art scene in the 1950s. His work, like that of several early modern Western sculptors, is grounded in the human figure. But the fact that India is home to a celebrated, 3000-year-old tradition of figural sculpture is not what makes him remarkable. His work, however, does not connect up with his legacy, as much as it does with the early modernist tradition of using figure as an autonomous, non-narrative embodiment of expressive and symbolic content. While ancient Indian sculpture remains a pinnacle of achievement for Roy Choudhury, it is the product of a collective form of creativity and a different kind of patronage, both alien to the modern period. Beginning his career soon after Independence, he moved from a tradition of sculpture that revolved around portraits and public monuments, towards sculpture that saw the human figure as an intimate object, free from narration and external reality and manifesting the artists sensibility. For him, more than likeness, a portrait has to be haunting and compelling; only then will it continue to live, transcending history. This evening, on the occasion of the opening of a retrospective show of his works, Ashok Vajpeyi will launch R. Siva Kumars Sensibility Objectified: The Sculptures of Sarbari Roy Chowdhury. Hosted by Akar Prakar, Lalit Kala Akademi and Mapin Publishing.                  Event: Launch of R. Siva Kumars book Sensibility Objectified: The Sculptures of Sarbari Roy Chowdhury, along with a preview of a retrospective show of the sculptors work When: Today; 6 pm Where: Akar Prakar, P 238 Hindustan Park

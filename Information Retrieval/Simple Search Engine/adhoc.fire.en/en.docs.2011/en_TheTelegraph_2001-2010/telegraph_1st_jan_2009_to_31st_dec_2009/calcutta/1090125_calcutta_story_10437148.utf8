The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Man U maniac
                                                                                                               Man U maniac
                          Sugata Mukherjee watches a Man U match in his room. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                 
	Sugata Mukherjee, 21, is not very popular in his para, opposite NRS Hospital. His neighbours grumble about the boy whose voice can be heard in the dead of night, cheering his team in a match being played 10,000 miles away. His parents have given up on him. After all, what do you do about someone who eats, drinks, sleeps and dreams Manchester United?        
	But now, the Wayne Rooney (picture below) devotee will be going where no else from his para has  the Old Trafford temple where his gods (also known as the Red Devils) play. The power of his love for the team has won this third-year student of mathematics in Asutosh College an all-expense paid trip to Manchester United turf.        
	It feels out of this world, said Sugata on Saturday, after being crowned winner of Nikes Extreme Manchester United Fan contest. He will visit the Old Trafford stadium for a home game, go to Man Us training ground Carrington, and tour the Old Trafford stadium and museum.              
	The contest, open to individuals between 15 to 25 and hosted on nikefootball.in. needed fans to send in bizarre pictures showing how crazy they are about their favourite club. The maximum entries were from Delhi and Mumbai, but this Calcutta fan won hands down, said Sanjay Gangopadhyay, the marketing director of Nike India.        
	Sugata says he saw the ad in The Telegraph and from September 27 to November 1 checked the Internet every day till the details were uploaded. His winning picture? I asked my friend to paint the Man U crest on my face and we took two days to paint a Man U flag, smiles the youth who has been a Man U maniac since 1999, the year of the Treble (Champions League, Premier League, FA Cup).        
	Sugata started watching because of David Beckham but fell in love with the club after learning of its history and tradition (Munich air disaster, winning streak, Eric Cantona, Alex Ferguson...).        
	Now, theres no stopping the roar of the red. When I used to shout while watching a match, my mother often said, they (Man U players) cannot hear you. After I got the phone call about winning the contest, I told her, Now they will hear me.

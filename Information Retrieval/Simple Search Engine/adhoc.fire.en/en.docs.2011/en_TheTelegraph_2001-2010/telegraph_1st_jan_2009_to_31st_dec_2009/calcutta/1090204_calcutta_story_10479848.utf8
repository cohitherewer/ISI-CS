The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bus lobby forces fare rejig
                                                                                                               Bus lobby forces fare rejig
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The state government is likely to announce a new fare chart for buses and minibuses on Wednesday, barely five days after new fares were announced on Friday.        
	The fares are being revised to accommodate the demands of bus operators, who want lesser reduction in some slabs.        
	Bus and minibus operators met transport minister Subhash Chakraborty at Netaji Indoor Stadium on Tuesday afternoon and objected to the unilateral revision of fares.        
	We told the minister that we dont accept this revision and asked him why the government hadnt discussed the matter with us, Swarnakamal Saha, the president of the Bengal Bus Syndicate, told Metro.        
	However, during the meeting, the operators accepted most of Fridays fares, asking for a few minor changes.        
	We didnt have much to bargain for. We asked the government not to change the existing rates of Rs 6 for the first eight-12 km and Rs 8 for 20-24 km. The government has agreed to reconsider, said Sadhan Das, the general secretary of the Joint Council of Bus Syndicates.        
	The fares, as proposed by the bus operators, are Rs 4 for the first four km (unchanged), Rs 5 for four to eight km (less by Re 1), Rs 6 for eight to 12 km (unchanged), Rs 6 for 12 to 16 km (less by Re 1), Rs 7 for 16 to 20 km (unchanged), Rs 8 for 20 to 24 km (unchanged) and a hike of 50 paise for every four km thereafter.        
	The minor adjustments demanded by the operators are most likely to be incorporated, said a transport department official.         
	Tuesdays meeting was a routine muscle-flexing exercise by the operators, he added.        
	Minibus operators suggested a new fare structure  Rs 5 for the first four km, Rs 6 for four to eight km and Rs 7 for eight to 10 km. The existing structure is Rs 5 for the initial two km, Rs 6 for two to six km and Rs 7 for six to 10 km. The new fares will come into effect from February 10.

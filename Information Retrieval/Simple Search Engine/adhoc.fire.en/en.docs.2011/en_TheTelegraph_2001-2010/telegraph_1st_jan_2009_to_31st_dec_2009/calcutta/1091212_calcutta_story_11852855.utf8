The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Garbari in IT project: Mollah
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Garbari in IT project: Mollah
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	There were irregularities in the land deals linked to the now-scrapped IT township project in Rajarhat and Bhangar in South 24-Parganas, land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah said in the Assembly on Friday. The minister also promised action against the guilty.        
	I have found lapses in my departments work. There is some garbari (wrongdoing). Departmental proceedings will start against those found guilty, Mollah said.        
	He was speaking in response to a query from Manas Bhuniya of the Congress, who had demanded the publication of a white paper on shady deals by the project promoters.        
	The IT township project was being promoted by Vedic Realty, a company of Raj K. Modi who also owns Vedic Village. The project was scrapped after the arson attack on the luxury resort on August 22, that led to the arrest of Modi on a host of charges, including land grabbing.        
	The minister told the House on Friday that he would unveil the probe report on the IT township and consider publishing a white paper.        
	Mollah refused comment on the law and order problems at Vedic Village. I wont comment on that. Three companies had been given around 44 acres on a 99-year lease. The place was meant to be developed as a resort. All the rules were followed, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Old world in new look
                                                                                                               Old world in new look
          ONTHESPOT - INDIAN COFFEE HOUSE, COLLEGE STREET                        Construction work going on at Indian Coffee House on College Street; (below) the facade. Pictures by Bishwarup Dutta				                                       
	Sacks of cement and sand are dumped very close to the table where Krittika Bhattacharya, a first-year student of Presidency College, is chatting with her friends in Indian Coffee House on a Friday afternoon.         
	An abridged menu is doing the rounds  coffee, sandwiches and pakora, as work is on in the Coffee House kitchen  and the timings have changed too (open from noon to 8pm on workdays and closed on Sunday), but that isnt stopping people from dropping in.         
	While carrying on with its business, the 15 Bankim Chatterjee Street address is getting a makeover for Rs 25 lakh, under the supervision of Bengal Shelter Housing Development.        
	The Coffee House renovation is an extension of the Varna Parichay project on College Street. The Indian Coffee Workers Cooperative Society didnt have the funds to carry out the revamp, so we are doing it for them, said Samar Nag, the managing director of Bengal Shelter.        
	The renovation involves civil and electrical work, besides sprucing up the interiors. Work started three weeks ago. The inside walls have got a coat of plaster, and the drainage line, toilets and staircase have been repaired. In the pipeline are repairs on doors and windows, and replacing the out-of-work chimneys.         
	We had started with a three-week deadline but the civil work is taking time. We aim to finish before the month-end, said Amitav Biswas, the associate architect (planning) of Prakalpa, the consulting agency for Bengal Shelter.        
	Work is continuing on a war footing to meet the Bhasha Divas deadline. On February 21, we plan to organise a camp in Coffee House where several artists and writers will be invited for an interaction, said Nag.

	Whether the new-look Coffee House will be a far cry from its old self is what is bothering most loyalists of this adda address.         
	A makeover is always welcome but the Coffee House shouldnt lose its charm. It shouldnt be turned into a swanky coffee outlet, said Krittika.         
	Blending the old with a few new add-ons is also what Bengal Shelter is aiming to do. The renovated Coffee House will not be a new-age cafe. The old-world feel will be retained, Nag promised.         
	One of the marked changes will definitely be the lighting. We want to use cove lighting and a prismatic dome for a diffused illumination, said Biswas of Prakalpa.         
	The highlight on the walls will be a mural on a wooden panel, which is being designed by the Government College of Art and Craft.         
	We want to uphold the boi para ambience of College Street, with its architecture, bylanes and rickshaws, said Dipali Bhattacharya, a faculty member of the art college.         
	Separate zones to put up posters will also be carved out. We plan to have specific poster zones and decorate the walls in such a way that people wont deface all of it, added Biswas.         
	An addition will be the Voice of Calcutta board where visitors will be able to scribble their remarks, alongside a collapsible stage.

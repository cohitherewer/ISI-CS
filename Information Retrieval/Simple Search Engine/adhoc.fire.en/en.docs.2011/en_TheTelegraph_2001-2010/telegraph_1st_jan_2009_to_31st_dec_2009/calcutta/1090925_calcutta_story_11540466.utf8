The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Festival theme safe and green
                                                                                                               Festival theme safe and green
										                                
	Shyambazar-Hatibagan        
	The pujas in the area score high on enthusiasm but suffer by accident of geography.        
	Most of the idols stick to the traditional ekchala style, with shola or zari work, with the exception of Hatibagan Sarbojanin, whose Durga as a marble statue of a Roman goddess seems to have sacrificed credulity to innovation.                       Kashi Bose Lane				     
	Kashi Bose Lane Durga Puja Committee, last years Two Star winner, is exemplary in its adherence to True Spirit norms. Emergency numbers are prominently displayed at the helpdesk. Drinking water and toilet facilities are up to the mark. There are also a sound-proof generator and LED emergency lamps for the entire premises.        
	Senior citizens and the physically challenged have a lane to themselves. The organisers have used last years prize money to set up a free acupressure clinic. The pandal, decorated with mirrors, is quite a sight.        
	Though packed cheek by jowl with houses, with snaking alleys as the sole approaches, Shyambazar Nabin Sangha has tried to fulfil the True Spirit criteria. Fire-resistant chemicals have been used on the walls, there are eight fire extinguishers and the electrical wiring is neat. Panels showcase dance forms of various regions.         
	Both Shyam Square Sarbojanin Durga Puja O Prodorshoni and Bagbazar Palli Pujo O Prodorshoni are organised on open grounds, giving them ample scope to organise clean, visitor-friendly pujas. Yet the arrangements are dismal, with an electrical disaster waiting to happen. Empty counters and absence of organisers are conspicuous at Shyam Square. Waste greets visitors near the gate.         
	Selimpur-Jodhpur Park        
	Big or small, many of the pandals on the route failed to steer clear of the non-biodegradable styrofoam.                    Babu Bagan Club    
	Pallymangal Samity, which replicated Mrinmoi Mas temple in Bankura, and 95 Pally Sarbojanin Durgotsav, which created the Bikaner Laksmi Niwas palace, are two of the pandals made from styrofoam.        
	We have sprayed the pandal with fire-retardant material and we will reuse the styrofoam, claimed an organiser at 95 Pally, which has also cut branches to accommodate its entrance.        
	Most of the pujas struggled to conform to the True Spirit guidelines because of poor civic amenities and traffic and waste management.        
	Babu Bagan Club, which recreated a two-storey old house that blended into the surroundings, paid little attention to making the puja safe. If the Sashthi morning crowd jostling to climb up stairs was an indicator, the organisers will struggle to control Puja rush.        
	We will stop people from entering if it gets too crowded, said an organiser.        
	The puja that upheld the True Spirit ideals was Keyatala Pally Samity, even after being hit hard by rain. It had a superbly equipped first-aid centre and trained fire fighters were at hand.        
	A common theme of the pujas on the route was peace, with a couple even removing the weapons from the deities hand.                    Tangra Gholpara    
	Tangra-Salt Lake        
	The lanes that lead to Tangra Gholpara Sarbojanin Durgotsav are narrow but organisers have done their best to control the crowd.        
	Cars have to be parked several metres away and all visitors have to walk into the lane. Were using ropes to guide visitors and they are being allowed into different sections of the pandal in groups of 10, said an organiser.         
	With clouds covering the sky, DL Block Residents Association in Salt Lake has taken a last-minute decision to build a raised pathway to the pandal. We had 1,500 visitors on Panchami itself. We do not want people to slip on the slush. So we started building the pathway two days ago and it will be ready tonight, said an organiser on Thursday morning.         
	AE (Part I) Block Committee, which is making its True Spirit debut, has put up posters banning the use of plastic. We got the impetus from the True Spirit guidelines, said an organiser.         
	A live wire was lying on the floor in front of AB Block Abasik Sangha puja.         
	While several pujas had arranged for wheelchairs, FD Block Sarbojanin was one of the few pandals that had a ramp leading to the mandap. We are keeping the ramp free for the physically challenged, said an organiser.        
	The idol has been painted with lead-free colour. We have also used power-saving LED lamps and are trying to arrange for solar lights. We want to inspire visitors to conserve energy, added the organiser.        
	Ballygunge-Santoshpur        
	Many of the pujas in the area had made proper fire-prevention arrangements and used LEDs to save power. Six of the pujas had also made special arrangements for the physically challenged and senior citizens.                     Santoshpur Lake Pally    
	Saradia Sammilani on Ekdalia Road, whose pandal reflects the colour and beauty of things of daily use in rural life, had brightly painted wastebins, list of numbers needed in an emergency and even a wash basin with soap. The organisers also erected a watch tower and installed closed-circuit cameras.         
	Santoshpur Avenue South Palli Mangal Samiti put up a large map showing the route to the nearest hospital. They also displayed addresses of houses where temporary toilets had been built. This puja scored over others in terms of electrical wiring and providing emergency exits.        
	Falguni Sangha, on Suren Tagore Road, and Adi Ballygunge Sarbojonin, off Rifle Range Road, also made good safety arrangements.         
	Adi Ballygunge Sarbojonin, Santoshpur Trikon Park Sarbojonin and Palli Mangal Samiti had put up fire nets that prevent flames from spreading.        
	Arrangements at Picnic Sunrise Club and Rabindra Memorial Sporting Club were not in place but organisers claimed they would be by Sashthi evening.         
	Howrah        
	Pujas across the Hooghly have come of age with organisers becoming aware of the True Spirit of the festival.        
	Ten of the 15 pujas in the city made a sincere effort to make this Puja a safe one.                    Olabibitola Sarbojanin    
	Olabibitola Sarbojanin Durgotsav Committee tops the list. The cane pandal was sprayed with fire retardants and a fire services officer supervised the preventive measures. The organisers had also arranged for a generator and emergency lights. The medical corner had a doctor, a stretcher and a well-equipped first-aid box.        
	Santragachi Kalpataru Sporting Club, which depicted a village devastated by Aila, planted a lot of trees not just to give the place a feel of the Sunderbans but also to contribute to the green movement.        
	But there were also pandals in the area that fell far short of expectation. Case in point is Arupara Sarbojanin Durgotsav Committee. The pandal, depicting the results of addiction, has naked electrical wires hanging in the rain and waste littered across the premises.        
	Crowd management was a problem at Santragachi Kalpataru Sporting Club.

	Calcutta police and NGO The Bengal have organised a tour of True Spirit Pujas on Navami for senior citizens who are registered with the helpline, Pronam. Those who want to take the tour will have to contact their local police station or the Pronam office next to Ballygunge police station.

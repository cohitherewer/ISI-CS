The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mother held for brothel deal
                                                                                                               Mother held for brothel deal
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A woman was arrested in a red-light area of Bowbazar on Tuesday while allegedly trying to sell her 13-year-old daughter. Police said they were alerted by residents who spotted Rita Naskar trying to strike a deal with touts.        
	The girl has been sent to a state-run home for destitutes in Liluah. Rita, a resident of Murshidabad, told the cops that poverty had forced her to consider selling her child. She settled the deal for Rs 3,000, said an officer.        
	Suicide bid: Metro trains could not run between Girish Park and Dum Dum stations for 30 minutes on Tuesday evening following a suicide attempt by a woman at Belgachia. Razia Banu, 32, jumped before a Dum Dum-bound train but escaped with minor injuries as the driver applied the brakes in time. Services resumed at 7.45pm.        
	Award: Raja Rammohan Puraskar 2009 was conferred on laser physicist, author and philanthropist Mani L. Bhaumik last week by Sankar Biswas, the president of Ram Mohan Mission. Bhaumiks work includes the worlds first conclusive demonstration of Excimer laser used for vision correction.        
	Body found: The decomposed body of a 72-year-old widow was found in her second-floor flat in Sinthee on Tuesday. Anima Basaks neighbours, who did not see the woman step out in two days, alerted police. Basak was suffering from heart and kidney ailments.

	Travel buffs are making a beeline for Tourist Spot, a tourism fair at the Netaji Indoor Stadium. The three-day event (June 26-28) has been organised by the department of tourism of the state government and Anandabazar Patrika.        
	State tourism minister Manabendra Mukherjee, Orissa tourism minister Debi Prasad Mishra, film-maker Gautam Ghose and author Sunil Gangopadhyay were present at the inauguration on Friday.        
	Travelling is a habit and fairs like these encourage people to tour, said Mukherjee. He hoped Calcuttans who holiday outside the state will also be inspired to explore West Bengal.        
	Mukherjee said Bengal was the fifth most popular destination in India for foreign tourists and ranked seventh in popularity for the domestic traveller. The West Bengal stall at the fair featured places like Santiniketan, the Sunderbans, Bishnupur and Digha.        
	We are also trying to develop new avenues like tea garden tourism and river tourism. In the city, we plan to develop the banks of the Hooghly, Subhash Sarovar, Chinatown and illuminate heritage buildings, the minister said.         
	Mukherjee also stressed the need for a private-public-partnership to promote tourism. Land for a Tourism Plaza has been identified near the EM Bypass, he added.         
	We have decided to tie-up with the West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation (WBTDC) and are planning to improve road and rail connectivity so that foreign tourists coming to Bengal may also visit Orissa, said Mishra, the tourism minister from the state.        
	The participation of tour operators, representatives of hotels and resorts, and tourism boards from various states as well as countries like Finland, Kenya and Egypt has made the fair a one-stop destination for holidaymakers. If Finland is coming to the city, it means they see a huge potential here, said Tarakeshwar Singh of Jet Setters, which has brought Finland to the fair.        
	Tourist Spot has 180 stalls against 146 last year.        
	The purpose of the fair is to create a brand image for West Bengal tourism and also create awareness among people about the participants, said WBTDC managing director T.V.N. Rao.         
	The fair is open from 10am to 8pm.

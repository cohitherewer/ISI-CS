The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | City stopover for rare species 
                                                                                                               City stopover for rare species 
          A STAFF REPORTER                               Blue Sheep (top) and Himalayan Thar				                                 
	Five pairs of rare Himalayan ungulates arrived at the city airport early on Wednesday, on their way to the Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park in Darjeeling.        
	The three pairs of Himalayan Thar and two pairs of Blue Sheep are gifts from Japan, which had received two young elephants  Rahul and Devi  from India two years back.        
	The endangered animals will be kept in quarantine near the city airport for a month before they are shifted to the Darjeeling zoo.         
	While in quarantine, the animals would be under the care of veterinary doctors and dieticians, said an official of the Darjeeling zoo.         
	Alankar Jha, the director of the zoo, said these animals were difficult to find in the wild now. Once they join us, Darjeeling zoo would be the only one in India to house such rare animals, he added.         
	Blue Sheep, which gets its name from the bluish sheen on its coat, belongs to a near threatened subspecies. The head and upper body of the animals are brown-grey with a hint of slate blue. The underbelly and insides of the legs are white. Wildlife experts put their number in the wild between 200 and 300.         
	The Himalayan Thar, also known as Himalayan Tahr, is related to the wild goat family. The Thar is distinguishable by its short legs. The head is also small for its body, with large eyes, and small, pointed ears. The horns are triangular and curve backwards. In winter, the Thar grows a reddish brown woolly coat with a thick undercoat. Darjeeling zoo currently has one Thar, a female.         
	Thar and Blue Sheep are high-altitude species. After getting an approval from the Central Zoo Authority, we plan to breed them at the zoo once they settle down, Jha added.         
	Sources in the forest department said Japans return gesture was delayed by red tape. The files were stuck between the two embassies till senior forest officials took up the matter with New Delhi, said an official.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Height relief hits hurdle
                                                                                                               Height relief hits hurdle
  - Building file lies idle for six months        DEEPANKAR GANGULY                                                  
	Planning to erect a commercial tower in the heart of the city?        
	Dont.        
	Planning to expand your companys operations in Calcutta and add to the square feet count?        
	Dont.        
	The citys building rules will not allow you to grow, even if you happen to beat the downturn blues and brave the Singur shock.        
	With vertical expansion limited to 14.5 metre on a regular-sized plot  five-six floors  the city centres commercial growth is stunted. Literally.        
	A proposal from the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) allowing commercial establishments to rise above the limiting ground realities defined by the 1990 rules has been going round in circles for over six months now.        
	At present, only the government can give a special clearance for vertical growth on a regular plot.        
	We need these new building rules for the growth of the city, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.        
	And for a boost to the financial health of the CMC, weighed down by a Rs 180 crore annual bill for the implementation of the Fifth Pay Commission.         
	According to the civic building departments estimates, if the building rules are modified, over five million square feet of commercial floor space can be added in the citys prime business areas within two-three years.        
	That would work out to an annual revenue surge of Rs 200 crore to the civic coffers.        
	The proposed power of relaxation of the CMC Building Rules 1990 involves a case-to-case evaluation of requests for vertical growth in the congested business hub.         
	The mayor-in-council would be vested with the power to relax building rules after studying the nature of the need, the fitness certificate and other factors.        
	Calcutta is the commercial capital of eastern India and the central business district  Burrabazar, Esplanade, Dalhousie Square, Camac Street and Park Street  is saturated. New business ventures are coming to town and are willing to pay the price but we are not able to provide them space because of the restriction, said the mayor.        
	The proposal was finalised and sent to the municipal affairs department in December 2008, in consultation with Jadavpur University engineers, members of CREDAI representing realtors, the institutes of architects and town planners, the association of land surveyors, the fire brigade, police and legal experts.        
	Now, one Bhattacharyya has petitioned another, the mayor urging the municipal affairs minister not to let the sleeping file lie.        
	The municipal affairs department in turn blames it on the state law department where the file has been sent. I have requested the law minister, Rabilal Moitra, to look into the matter, said minister Asok Bhattacharya.        
	Till 1984, the CMC enjoyed the power to relax building rules, if required. Building rules introduced in 1990 changed that and all powers were centralised.        
	Realising the need for local bodies to have more flexibility, the state municipal affairs department amended the Bengal Municipal Act in 2007 allowing municipal authorities to green-signal vertical growth on a case-to-case basis. The CMC was denied that power.        
	So, a suburban municipality like Tarakeswer, Bankura or Canning can allow construction of a 20-storeyed building under its jurisdiction but the CMC cannot.        
	The present set of building bylaws requires changes to suit the present context. We require some flexibility in rules so that buildings have a more contemporary format, said Sushil Mohta, the past secretary of Credai Bengal.

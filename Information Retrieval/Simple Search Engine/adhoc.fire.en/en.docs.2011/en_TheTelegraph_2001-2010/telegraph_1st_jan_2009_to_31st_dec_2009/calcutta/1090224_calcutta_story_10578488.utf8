                      Discovering reality                    The creative journey of young painter Mallika Das Sutar can be traced from hideous to beautiful or vice-versa. The real, visible world serves merely as a point of departure to her, a place from where she begins her quest of true reality. An artistic ugliness forms the cornerstone of Sublimity of the Grotesque, the ongoing maiden solo exhibition of her drawings and paintings. Beginning to work with a real object from real life, she deliberately distorts it to its grotesque form, often infusing an element of fantasy, humour or mimicry into her strange metamorphoses. However, distortion for her is not just an end in itself. Her reconstruction is intended to create a separate reality that is a critique of the apparent, tangible reality. It is, in fact, a phase through which she attempts to discover beauty of a higher order in what appears to be deformed and ugly. She breaks conventional notions of beauty only to build a completely new and original idea of it. Ultimately, her works conceive new values of life in an age when the reality generated by post-modernism and globalisation has questioned the validity of traditional values of living.                  Event: Paintings and drawings by Mallika Das Sutar When: Till February 28; 11 am - 7 pm Where: Galerie Karma, P-505 Keyatola Road

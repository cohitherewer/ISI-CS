The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CU to fix rules for Xaviers batch 
                                                                                                               CU to fix rules for Xaviers batch 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta University (CU) is preparing its criteria for admitting students from autonomous colleges such as St Xaviers, whose first batch since it got autonomy in 2006 will pass out in five months.        
	An official said the university syndicate would take up the issue at its next meeting and decide whether students from the autonomous colleges once attached to CU would be treated as outsiders or on a par with those from affiliated institutions.        
	The first batch from St Xaviers College since it started functioning as an autonomous institution will graduate this year. The university will have to decide by July the admission criteria of postgraduate courses for these students. The issue will soon be placed before the syndicate, said vice-chancellor Suranjan Das.        
	The admission process for the universitys postgraduate courses start in August.        
	St Xaviers has recently written to CU requesting it to expedite the process of fixing the postgraduate admission criteria for students from autonomous institutions, a university source said.        
	CU now keeps only five per cent of its postgraduate seats reserved for students from other universities. The rest are for students from the affiliated colleges.        
	An autonomous college can frame its own syllabi, conduct examinations and award degrees. The marksheets and certificates bear the stamps of both the college and the university.

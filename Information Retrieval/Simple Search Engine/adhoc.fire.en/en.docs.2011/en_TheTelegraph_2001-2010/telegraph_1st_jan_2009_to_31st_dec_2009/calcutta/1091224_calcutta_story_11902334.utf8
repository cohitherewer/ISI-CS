	Campus violence continued on Wednesday as supporters of the SFI and the Trinamul Congress Chhatra Parishad, as well as non-teaching employees, clashed in colleges in and around the city.         
	Skirmishes were reported from several colleges during polling and filing of nominations on Wednesday, but the trouble spun out of control at Asutosh College, where elections were held on Tuesday. The SFI retained control of the students union.         
	Trinamul Congress Chhatra Parishad supporters demanded a re-poll for the BA 2nd year constituency. When the students misbehaved with the principal, some Group D employees protested and this led to a clash, said a teacher of the college. The Trinamul Congress Chhatra Parishad refuted the charges and said their activists were beaten up.         
	Fearing that the clash might spill on to the streets, a team from Bhowanipore police station rushed to the college and arrested five persons, including an outsider.         
	At the other end of the city, students belonging to the two rival groups clashed in Dum Dum Motijheel College.         
	Group D employees called a ceasework on Wednesday after some of them were assaulted by students on Tuesday, said Dipak Chakraborty, the principal of Motijheel College, which is scheduled to hold polls in January.         
	The two students groups clashed outside the campus and blocked Dum Dum Road between 1.30pm and 4.30pm.         
	Just when we were about to withdraw our blockade, some officers of Dum Dum police station lathicharged us without any reason, said Pratim Pal, a student of the college and an SFI supporter.         
	The blockade was finally withdrawn at 4.30pm after senior officers intervened.         
	Not just in Dum Dum, cops were busy guarding campuses where elections were held on Wednesday. The SFI won in Manindra Chandra College, Budge Budge College, Maheshtala College and Sahid Anukul Chandra College while the Trinamul Chhatra Parishad formed the union in Jogesh Choudhury Law College.        
	Wednesday was the last day of filing nomination in some colleges. The Trinamul Chhatra Parishad won uncontested in Charuchandra College and New Alipore College while the SFI retained the Gurudas College students body unopposed.        
	Around 300 supporters of the Congress-backed Chhatra Parishad blockade College Street and MG Road for 25 minutes on Wednesday afternoon. They were protesting against alleged atrocities by SFI supporters. The blockade was withdrawn at 2.07pm.

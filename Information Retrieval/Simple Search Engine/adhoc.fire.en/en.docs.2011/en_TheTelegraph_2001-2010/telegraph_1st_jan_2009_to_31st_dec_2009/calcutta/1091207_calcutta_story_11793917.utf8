                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Nature takes over as teacher     Outdoors escape from virtual world for kids

	 Rishiraj Goenka will never forget the day he managed to cross a river suspended by a rope between two hills with the waters gushing below. It was a huge adrenaline rush, recalls the Class XII student of La Martiniere for Boys, who went for an adventure camp on the outskirts of Faridabad with the schools Heritage Club.        
	 Rashmick Bose, a Class IX student of Delhi Public School, Megacity, didnt know to cook anything until he found himself in the middle of nowhere with 30 hungry team-mates. Rashmick was on a trek to Bermiok and Rinchenpong in Sikkim when he helped cook a meal for the first time. We put too little salt in the khichdi but had no choice but to eat it, he laughs.        
	Switch off the computer and slip on your adventure shoes, shrug off that schoolbag and strap on a knapsack  the great outdoors is the seasons classroom of choice and nature the favourite teacher.        
	Examinations over, many city schools and private clubs are taking kids to jungle camps and treks to destinations like north Bengal, Sikkim and the Garhwal Himalayas for education of the adventurous kind.                
	Forty-two students from La Martiniere for Girls (LMG) head for a trek to Tumling and Tunglung (10,000ft) in north Bengal on December 11 as part of the International Award for Young People, a post-War Commonwealth initiative to help youngsters discover what they are made of, make an impact on their community, develop a set of life skills and, most of all, have fun.        
	Tapti Dasgupta, the schools environmental studies teacher and co-ordinator of the scheme, says she has seen students gain immensely from such treks and camps. Often, students are nervous before leaving. But they come back with new confidence, she adds.        
	Ask Anwesha Ghosh, a Class XII student of Modern High School, who returned from a trek to Sandakphu two weeks ago. A trek pits you against the elements. You learn how to take responsibility for yourself. You cant complain about food. You build your own toilets. A trekking regular for four years, she is now confident that shell know how to survive even if she was left alone in a desert.        
	Low-altitude jungle and coastal treks  not deserts  are the destinations of choice for tween-teen adventure camps this winter. Mountaineer Parthasarathi Dutta of The Adventure Quest, who has just returned from an adventure camp in Nainital with a group of students from Calcutta International School, says: With the onset of snowfall, high-altitude trek routes become unapproachable. So we take kids to areas that are below 10,000ft.        
	Another no-no this year is Purulia because of the Maoist threat. But north Bengal and Bankura get everyones nod.        
	Attendance at adventure camps, which pack in a host of activities like rock climbing, kayaking, river-crossing, and rope training, including monkey crawling, has been rising year on year. There were only 12 students from LMG in 2002 when I started organising the programme. Now there are 250 trekking enthusiasts from the school, says Joydeep Ghosal, the expedition co-ordinator for the International Award.        
	More and more parents are welcoming the idea of their children logging out of the virtual world and heading out to experience the real. We spent so much of our growing-up years out in the open but now these adventure camps are the only window for our kids to taste freedom, said Smita Roy, mother of two teens.        
	A date with nature is the clincher, confirms camp organiser Dutta. Cooped up in the city, kids are hardly in touch with nature. They easily take to outdoor activities like bird watching and star gazing.        
	DIY (do it yourself) is the other big draw. My 15-year-old son does not lift a finger at home. But thanks to these adventure camps hes learnt to cook and fend for himself, smiles Sundeep Agarwal, a 42-year-old businessman.

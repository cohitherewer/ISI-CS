          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Six armed extortionists walked into a factory at Dasnagar in Howrah on Wednesday morning and tried to shoot its owner after he refused to hand over iron scrap worth lakhs.        
	The bullet grazed factory-owner Subhash Koleys right arm. He was admitted to Howrah State General Hospital.        
	According to police, the gang laid siege to the factory, which manufactures metal tools, around 7am, soon after Koley, who lives in the neighbourhood, entered the premises.        
	The six came on three motorcycles. They walked into Koleys room and asked him to hand over all the scrap iron in the factory, said an officer of Jagachha police station.        
	When Koley refused, one of the gang members brought out a revolver and fired at him. Labourers in the factory, which deals with tools and machinery, came out on hearing the gunfire. Sensing trouble, the gang members rode away on their motorcycles.        
	Residents rushed Koley to hospital.        
	According to the police, several extortion gangs are active in the area.

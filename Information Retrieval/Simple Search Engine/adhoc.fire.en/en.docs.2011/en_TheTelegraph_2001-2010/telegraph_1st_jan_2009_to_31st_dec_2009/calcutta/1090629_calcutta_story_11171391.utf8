The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Chilli as murder weapon
                                                                                                               Chilli as murder weapon
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The two teenaged high school students who were found with their heads smashed on Saturday had little chance of saving themselves after the assailants blinded them with chilli powder, police said.         
	Subhankar Adhikari, the 16-year-old arrested for allegedly plotting and executing the twin murders along with a youth, told interrogators that he had been consumed with anger after being threatened by the victims.        
	The four of them were good friends until it emerged that Subhankar and one of the murdered boys  15-year-old Sudipta Manna  were in love with the same girl, an officer said. The other victim, 14-year-old Bappa Mondal, paid the price for supporting Sudipta.        
	Subhankar was remanded in police custody till July 3 on Sunday. The co-accused, 22-year-old Tarun Mondal, is still absconding.        
	The police said Subhankar and Tarun had lured Bappa and Sudipta to a field 4km from their houses in Bishnupur, under South 24-Parganas, on Friday.        
	When the duo arrived, they threw chilli powder into their eyes and smashed their heads with a log. They also used a sharp weapon, which we have yet to find, the officer said.

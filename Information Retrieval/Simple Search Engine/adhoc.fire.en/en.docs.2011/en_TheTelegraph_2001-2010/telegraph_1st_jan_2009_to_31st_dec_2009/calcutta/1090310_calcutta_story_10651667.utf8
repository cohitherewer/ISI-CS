The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Out-of-use jetty awaits overhaul
                                                                                                               Out-of-use jetty awaits overhaul
										      ONTHESPOT - COSSIPORE JETTY                        Jettisoned: The broken Cossipore jetty. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta				                                 
	Once a jetty, now a place for shanty dwellers to dry clothes. The broken gangway at Cossipore, which prompted the Hooghly Nadi Jalpath Paribahan Samavay Samity to keep ferry services suspended for the past three months, is turning from bad to worse.         
	The authorities are yet to start repair work and, meanwhile, squatters are making off with the jettys expensive iron parts. Metro takes a look.         
	Launch service: The Cossipore ghat launch service is more than 20 years old. Ferries leaving from Cootighat in Baranagar stop by Ratanbabu ghat and Cossipore ghat before reaching Bagbazar. A large number of people used the ferry service from Cossipore to reach Howrah and other places. At present, the ferries are bypassing the Cossipore stop.         
	Present condition: The pier leading to the pontoon is riddled with large holes. The railings are missing and nails are sticking out of the wooden planks. There was an attempt to repair the gangway with bamboo but the makeshift structure is in a shambles too.         
	There have been mishaps in the recent past when people tripped on the wobbly planks and injured themselves, said Ashok Tarafdar, a commuter.         
	The condition of the jetty is so bad that accidents can happen any time. I had written to the Hooghly Nadi Jalpath Samavay Samity about three years ago to repair the jetty, but nothing was done. There has been no maintenance in the past six-seven years, said Suman Singh, the Congress councillor from ward 6.         
	Who is responsible for the jettys upkeep: Hooghly Nadi Jalpath Paribahan Samavay Samity, a licensee of WBSTC. The Samity is in charge of the ferry service as well as the maintenance of the jetty (pontoon and gangway). The Samity pays a rent of Rs 3,650 a month per jetty to the WBSTC.         
	Though reality paints a different picture, the Samity claims it has undertaken regular upkeep work. We have carried out maintenance work and changed the wooden planks. But the jetty needs an overhaul as it is more than 20 years old, said Lagan Deo Singh, the chairman of Hooghly Nadi Jalpath Paribahan Samavay Samity.        
	Commuter woes: The suspension of the launch service has affected the workers of the gun and shell factory and the CESC thermal power plant in Cossipore.        
	It would take us only 25 minutes to reach Howrah from Cossipore, via Bagbazar. Now it takes us an hour and a half by bus. A lot of people used to avail of the launch service. We cant understand why it is not being resumed, said Somnath Bose, an employee of the gun and shell factory. The launch was a faster mode of reaching Bagbazar and the trip was pollution-free too. Now, going to Bagbazar is a detour for us, echoed Rajesh Singh, a resident of 14 KC Road in Cossipore.        
	Contrary to what the commuters say, the Samity claims the Baranagar-Bagbazar launch service is a loss-making venture.        
	We run at a loss in this route because of the low fares  Rs 4.5 and Rs 5. Also because many commuters now prefer to take surface transport as the road conditions have improved, said the samity chairman.        
	The solution: Since the jetty is in a dilapidated state, we plan to overhaul it with a budget of Rs 6.5 lakh. But since this process will take a few months, we are trying to resume the ferry service by the beginning of April after some repairs, said Deo Singh.

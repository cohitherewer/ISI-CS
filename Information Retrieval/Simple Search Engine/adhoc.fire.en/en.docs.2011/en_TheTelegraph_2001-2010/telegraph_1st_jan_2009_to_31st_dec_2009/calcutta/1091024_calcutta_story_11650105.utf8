The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Glare on parking amp; pavement
                                                                                                               Glare on parking amp; pavement
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                                      
	Calcutta High Court has given the government a fortnight to come up with a status report on the citys parking and pavement chaos.        
	Nobody seems interested in solving the problems relating to encroachment of pavements and illegal parking in the city, said the division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice B. Somadder, revisiting an order issued three years ago to rid eight busy thoroughfares of hawkers.        
	According to the judges, police had done little in the past three years to evict hawkers from Brabourne Road, Kali Krishna Tagore Street, Kalakar Street, NS Road, Strand Road, Rabindra Sarani, Mahatma Gandhi Road and AJC Bose Road.        
	The court also blamed shop owners for the chaos, saying they were just as guilty as hawkers of encroaching on space meant for pedestrians.        
	When advocate-general Balai Ray argued that the government was concerned about illegal parking and encroachment of pavements, Chief Justice Nijjar said: Whatever the government wants to do, it should do immediately.         
	The court asked the advocate general to first compile a report on the steps taken by the government so far to clear the pavements along the eight arteries of the central business district.        
	Ray said the government was studying various models to find the best possible solution. In some cities, vehicles are not allowed on a few roads so that these can be used as free hawker zones for a fixed number of hours. We are trying to adopt the same policy.         
	On illegal parking, the court said that the government needed to strictly implement road rules for the city to be able to bear the burden of increasing traffic.        
	The order was issued on the basis of a 2003 petition by environment activist Subhash Dutta, also responsible for initiating the foul-fume campaign.        
	Dutta had pointed out that pedestrians were being forced to walk on the main roads because hawkers had overrun the pavements.         
	Such blatant violation of road rules is not only triggering accidents but also slowing down traffic, resulting in more pollution, he added.        
	The activist also submitted photographs in the court showing how shop owners had encroached on the pavement along NS Road.        
	Metro has over the years been running a campaign against both pollution and illegal parking.        
	Several years have passed since the petition was admitted but the state is yet to take corrective steps. During every hearing, the counsel says that a national policy on hawkers would be implemented soon. This time, the court has clearly said that it wont grant any more time, Dutta said after Fridays hearing.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Haldiram suit
                                                                                                               Haldiram suit
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The owner of the Haldiram outlet on AJC Bose Road moved the high court on Tuesday, accusing police of holding up the reopening of his eatery by refusing to issue a no-objection certificate.         
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation had informed the court two weeks ago that the popular food stop, forced to shut down after a third blaze in as many years, could be allowed to reopen.        
	The fire services department too expressed satisfaction over the preventive measures that had been taken since the last blaze.        
	Both the fire services department and the CMC have given the company permission to reopen the shop but the police are preventing it, the companys counsel said.         
	The government lawyer disputed the claim.         
	Lawyers representing the fire services department in an earlier case had said that the authorities were satisfied with the preventive measures taken (by Haldiram), but that cannot substitute a no-objection certificate. Unless there is a written certificate, the police cannot allow the shop to reopen, said the government lawyer.        
	Justice Sanjeev Banerjee asked the company to issue a notice to the CMC. The case will be next heard on Wednesday.

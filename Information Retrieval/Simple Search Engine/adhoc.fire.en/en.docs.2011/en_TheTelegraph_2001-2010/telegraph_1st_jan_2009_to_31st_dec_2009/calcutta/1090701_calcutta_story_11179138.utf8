The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hurrah for heavy rain
                                                                                                               Hurrah for heavy rain
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Monsoon rain, as we know it, is finally here.        
	Five weeks after Aila dragged in a premature and weakened monsoon and five days after the monsoon flow over the city was finally activated, a heavy cloud cover followed by showers marked Tuesday.        
	The weatherman held out hope of heavier rain during the week. Things are going to get wetter across the state as isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall is on the radar over the next 48 hours, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	Going by the weather office records, heavy monsoon rain generally comes down on Calcutta by mid-June.        
	The Met office on Monday had said a low-pressure formation would bring heavier rains to south Bengal, especially the city and its neighbourhood.        
	The heavier rain (than what the city has been getting over the past few days) was activated by an active and strong low-pressure trough ranging from Gangetic Bengal to the coast. It will ensure isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall over the next 48 hours at least, said Debnath.        
	Calcutta on Tuesday enjoyed 31.5mm of rain, mostly during the late afternoon and evening. The mercury settled at the normal maximum mark of 33.5 degree Celsius, with relative humidity ranging between 95 per cent and 72 per cent.        
	The late afternoon rain forced flight delays at the Calcutta airport. Two flights returned to Calcutta because of bad weather. After taking off at 2.30pm, the IndiGo flight to Jaipur returned at 4.15pm. The Kingfisher flight to Jamshedpur took off at 3.15pm but returned at 4.40pm.        
	The departure of 10 flights was delayed by 15-20 minutes on an average in the late afternoon because of heavy rain and lightning making conditions unsuitable for flying.

           MAHI MAGIC: Apropos the report Mahi of Midnapore, Nov. 9, the mark of a true professional is to perform consistently and at a higher level than others. Mahendra Singh Dhoni sets an example to everybody about reaching ones goals. Dhonis journey from being a tennis ball player in para cricket to captaining the Indian cricket team is truly inspiring. It is a great achievement that someone who would get Rs 2,000 in khep matches now earns Rs 60 lakh only from his annual retainership with BCCI, that too in just six years.                                     
	Mishaps on Calcutta roads resulting from rash driving have turned out to be disgracefully frequent (Bus race mishap, despite pleas, Nov. 13). More condemnable is the habit of drivers of two buses on the same route to overtake each other in a mad rush for waiting passengers, even in places where buses are not supposed to stop. The passengers pleas to drivers not to engage in this deadly competition in most cases fall on deaf ears.           
	Hapless commuters, who are always at the receiving end, have to face humiliating comments from bus drivers, conductors and their helpers.           
	The repeated failure of the authorities concerned to rein in these defiant drivers is deplorable. They are routinely arrested, only to be set free after the intervention of their political godfathers.           
	The transport minister is in the habit of making pious protestations every now and then on the improvement of the transport system in the city and its suburbs. But is he willing to initiate some meaningful steps to keep these rash drivers on a leash?           
	P.B. Saha,Salt Lake                       
	I am not surprised at the news A life lost for Rs.40, Nov. 1, as I have myself faced the inhuman behaviour of attendants, nurses and doctors of a government hospital.             
	Last November, my mother was admitted to Chinsurah Sadar Hospital with renal failure. Over the the next seven days, I noticed helplessly the ruthless attitude of doctors, nurses and attendants.           
	The doctors come to see patients at will, nurses shift their work to attendants and the attendants extort money from the patients families at regular intervals. They do not fear anybody and declare that openly. The government shakes off responsibility saying that the attendants are engaged by the patients families.           
	Whoever engages the attendants, the government cannot shelve responsibility for any misdeed perpetrated by anybody inside a state hospital.           
	As for the so-called inquiry by the hospital authorities, rarely does an offender get adequate punishment, thanks to the unions and associations that hold sway over such institutions.           
	The mental torture I faced in the hospital forced me to bring my mother back home within a week. She passed away two days later.           
	Prabhat, Address not mentioned                               
	The death of Somnath Roy at SSKM Hospital bears out the tragic saga of appaling healthcare, dereliction of duty and utter apathy towards patients. The state government should order an inquiry into the death and the errant health employees should be given exemplary punishment.           
	Prahlad Agarwala, Majdia, Nadia                     
	The death of a patient at SSKM Hospital because of the refusal of the attendants to give him oxygen without a bribe is a chilling reminder of the inhuman conditions prevailing in most government hospitals. The attendants and the nurse on duty are worse than criminals as their deliberate negligence is tantamount to cold-blooded murder, which calls for the strictest punishment.           
	As long as such offenders go scot-free, patients like Somnath Roy will continue to die of neglect and apathy in government hospitals.           
	Lalita Agarwal, Kankurgachhi                               
	The tragic death of Somnath Roy at SSKM has once again proved that government hospitals in Calcutta are death traps. Two attendants who demanded Rs 40 in the dead of the night for administering oxygen to the patient were arrested later just as an eyewash.           
	The hospital superintendent says those rogues were not Group-D staffers of the hospital, but relatives of employees. Why were these scoundrels allowed a free run of the ward? When a patients relatives misbehave in a hospital, they are promptly dealt with by police, but why are the police not dealing with such goons?           
	To check a recurrence of such a ghastly incident I suggest that the hospital superintendent be showcaused immediately. The nurses on duty should be suspended for their inaction when the goons were demanding money and the group-D employees who are the goons alleged relatives should be identified and punished.

	Apropos Affair, murder amp; suicide Nov. 5, the teacher-student bond is pure. But the affair between Anushree Pal and Kuntal Ghosh and their deaths compel us to ponder whos to blame.             
	Atif Ayaz, Serampore                     
	It was shocking to read about a teacher murdering his student and then killing himself. Parents rely on teachers to take care of their children. But when such incidents happen, how can parents continue to trust teachers? Every teacher should remember that in the absence of the parents, s/he is a guardian to the students.           
	Rathin Chatterjee, Dum Dum                       
	It is common knowledge that a section of the police force is in league with extortionists and criminals, but cops selling cartridges to criminals is very frightening (Cash-for-cartridges trail leads to cop, Nov. 5).             
	The police chief must investigate the matter himself and put in place proper checks so that such instances dont repeat themselves.           
	The errant cop must be interrogated thoroughly to find out how many cartridges were sold by him. He should be dismissed with no retirement benefits and the income tax department should look into his assets.

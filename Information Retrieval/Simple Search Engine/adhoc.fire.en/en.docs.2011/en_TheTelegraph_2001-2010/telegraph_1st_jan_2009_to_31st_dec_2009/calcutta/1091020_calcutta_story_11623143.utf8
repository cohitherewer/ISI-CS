The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CBSE schools mull plus-II admission test
                                                                                                               CBSE schools mull plus-II admission test

	CBSE students trying to switch schools after Class X next year may have to sit for an admission test or face an interview, thanks to the Delhi boards decision to scrap marks and award only grades to school-leaving students.        
	Most CBSE schools have decided to introduce the test or the interview on the ground that a grade-only evaluation in Class X would come in the way of preparing a merit list of students seeking admission to the plus-II course.        
	Till 2009, the score card of Class X students in CBSE schools carried both marks and grades. In an attempt to reduce the stress on students, the board decided to award only grades from next year.        
	The grades will be divided on a nine-point scale. Itll be difficult to distinguish students seeking admission on the basis of grades. To ensure fairness in the admission process, we have decided to admit students from other schools to the plus-II course on the basis of their scores in the admission test, said Anindita Chatterjee, the principal of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan.        
	Usha Mehta, the director and administrator of BD Memorial School, said her institution would conduct both admission test and interview.        
	Malini Bhagat, the principal of Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School, said: We will hold interviews for admission-seekers. Their performance in the interviews will be taken into account during the selection.        
	An official of Birla High School for Boys said the authorities had not yet finalised the methodology for admission to Class XI. But we are trying to adopt a balanced and fair method to ensure that merit is not compromised during admission.        
	A section of teachers, however, feels the worst-hit would be those opting for the science stream with B1 or a lower grade.         
	Students scoring between 71 and 80 per cent will be awarded B1. Marks between 61 and 70 per cent will be represented by B2.        
	Students with A1 (91-100 marks) and A2 (81-90) grades will have no problem studying science. But those who will be awarded lower grades will find it difficult to find a science berth in most schools, said a teacher of a CBSE school in south Calcutta.         
	The rules followed by most examination boards allow schools to give priority to their own students during admission to Class XI. But students often want to switch to another institution when they are denied admission to a stream of their choice in their own schools. At times, students also want to shift to a better school after Class X.

                                                                                                                         3                                      Letters
           Rule, what rule? Police vehicles parked in double line on RN Mukherjee Road, narrowing the road space available for vehicles and pedestrians. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                             
	Apropos the report Poran Jai... a copy, says court, August 11, it is a matter of great shame that the Bengali film industry, which once boasted of legends likes Satyajit Ray, Tapan Sinha, Chhabi Biswas and Uttam Kumar (pictures above), has come to such a dreadful pass that it is not only being inspired by Bollywood, but also indulging in plagiarism to the extent of making a frame-by-frame copy of a Hindi film.           
	When Bengalis remained faithful to their roots and made films based on literature and their cultural heritage, it was Bollywood that looked East, remaking hit Bengali productions. But now Bengalis have abandoned their culture and started imitating Hindi films. But the latest act of a Bengali film, Poran Jai Joliya Re, blatantly copying a Bollywood film (Namastey London) is indeed the last nail in the coffin for Tollywood.           
	Unless the current crop of directors learn to respect their own selves, their profession, Bengali culture and the legacy of Tollywood, not even god can save this industry from going to the dogs.

	Apropos They make and break road rules, August 20, low-ranking traffic constables or home guards are scared to book police, military or any kind of official vehicle and the common people remain mute spectators fearing reprisal by the authorities.             
	Traffic safety weeks will continue to be observed with much fanfare but road safety standards will never improve because the authorities do not want it to improve. Shortage of manpower is the perennial excuse but not a single word is uttered by the authorities about inefficiency, nexus between police and political goons or dereliction of duty. So blood will continue to be spilled on the streets of Calcutta and we will continue to pay with our lives.

	Law enforcers are the biggest law violators. Police often book motorists and pillion riders for not wearing helmets but most cops driving motorcycles or riding pillion do not wear a helmet. Another glaring example was assistant commissioner Anil Kar, who was caught on camera by Metro smoking on duty in a public place on August 12. The senior officer simply said he wasnt aware of the rule. How can such policemen be protectors of the law?           
	Sanjay Agarwal, Address not mentioned                     
	Metro must be commended for exposing Calcutta polices callousness and disregard for rules. More pictures showing the licence plates of police vehicles found flouting traffic rules should be published. Only then will errant cops be restrained and punished.           
	Somdeb Majumdar, San Diego, US           
	Double and triple lane parking is rampant on Moira Street near Vidya Mandir during school rush hours, making the place very dangerous for children, who are forced to walk down the carriageway.           
	Neil Zaki, Address not mentioned           
	We appreciate the report on polices attitude towards traffic rules. Not only police vehicles, any vehicle having a government tag openly flouts road rules. I would like to highlight a special kind of arrangement made by the traffic police at the railway underpass on Maniktala Main Road. On either side of the underpass, there is a small signboard barring the entry of small vehicles. But this no-entry rule is flouted by all vehicles belonging to the police or government. This is unfortunate as the government spent public money to repair the underpass. Outside office hours, traffic cops use the passage as a trap. They remove the barriers which are supposed to prevent private cars from taking the underpass and the no entry board is too small to catch the eye of all motorists. When a vehicle enters the passage by mistake, the policemen harass the driver for a bribe, threatening to book him/her for road rule violation.

	Apropos the report Uttam Kumar stamp, August 29, it is thrilling to learn that the Indian postal department was to release a commemorative postage stamp, on Uttam Kumar on September 3. Uttam Kumar was not only a fantastic actor whose films left an indelible mark on the minds of movie lovers but also the very face of Bengali romance. The stamp comes as a bonus after the Metro station named after him.

	The report Biz boom along Bypass link, August 26, has gone to town about the concrete jungle being created in the Ruby hospital area, choking the lifeline of residents of the locality. No patch of green is spared from this so-called biz boom. Civic norms are being flouted blatantly and the prospect of breakdown of the fragile infrastructure is looming large here.             
	All around the Ruby connector, mindless development is creating an environment hazard, portending doomsday in the near future. The biz is certainly not a boon for thousands of residents living in the East Kolkata Township area.           
	Subhasish Ghosh, East Kolkata Township    
	Tapan Pal, in this column, has questioned Nobel Laureate Amartya Sens wisdom in believing that the city I came from, has a huge book culture (Book barb, 26 August). Pal made his tendentious remark about so great a man, the pride of Bengal and India, just because bookstore Odyssy downed shutters within 10 months of opening shop. All its pitfalls notwithstanding, Calcutta retains its vibrant ambience as a cultural hub. Pal even makes a disdainful reference to Book Fair because it is being considered bigger than even Frankfurt. I wonder if Pal has ever been to the fair, at least to witness the 10-day annual bonanza, if not to buy books.

	Apropos the report Contraband haul in raid on jail hospital, August 28, it is difficult to understand that despite claims of tight security at Presidency jail hospital, how restricted articles like alcohol, pornographic films, portable media players and cellphones entered the hospital premises. An officer has admitted that a nexus between prisoners and jail employees enable inmates to get anything they desire inside the jail hospital or prison cell. Jails are now called correctional homes, where a person who has committed a crime is reformed. But that requires a sea change in the moral character of jail employees and security forces. Such personnel should be awarded stringent punishment as they are responsible for corrupting correctional homes.             
	Sukumar Ghosh, Mukundapur                               
	Apropos Court axe on road-hog pandal, August 27, kudos to advocate Ipshita Chakraborty, who single-handedly took on a puja committee for completely obstructing her house by erecting a pandal. She must have been well aware of the consequences of raising her voice against the para boys but she did not let fear deter her from demanding her right, as outlined by the high court against road-hog pandals. Many people suffer silently when puja committees block roads in the name of a festival.             
	Prantik Sanyal, SP Mukherjee Road                               
	With reference to the report Polls keep Part I results waiting, dated November 4, kindly note that the announcement of the date of declaration of results is determined solely by the West Bengal State University and it has nothing to do with the date of polling or any other reason. The university has now decided that the marksheets of the students would be made available along with the publication of the result on the web. The exact date will be communicated to the principals of the colleges. It may kindly be noted that I have never made any statement to any reporter that I had received an order or communique from any government administration or Writers Buildings.             
	Kamales Bhaumik, registrar, West Bengal State University                     
	Metro replies: We stand by the report.                               
	The decision of the state government and the West Bengal University of Technology to allow more autonomy to some engineering colleges is reasonable (Autonomy for tech colleges, August 28). This will enable the colleges to take prompt decisions. WBUT will also get some relief in terms of work pressure.             
	However, the colleges should remember that freedom does not mean uncharted power. The interests of students need to be protected. The standard of teaching should be improved so that the colleges can produce better quality of students or engineers. Students or their guardians should not be put under pressure by abruptly enhancing fees and other charges.

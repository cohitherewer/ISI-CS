                      Songs of change                    Like the mythical bird Phoenix, that never dies, but rises from its own ashes, Rise From The Ashes, the six-member pop group, wishes to rise above its humble beginnings and assume a larger-than-life presence on the music horizon. This talented group of youngsters creates pure music, with lyrics that have depth and meaning and tunes melodious to the ears. Their music essentially caters to the youth of today and their heart-rending tracks send out a message of peace, tolerance, love and brotherhood to this strife-torn generation. Neil Mansukhani, the founder and senior-most member of the band, composes lyrics that spell out the ideologies and perceptions of his inner being. Simple, peppy and funky, his lyrics are also soothing and appealing. Based on facts and happenings in our daily lives, songs like Reason, When I Look Around, Smile Back On Your Face, Terror Cycle of Terrorism describe the evils and injustices of society, with a view to awaken the consciousness of its citizens and bring about a positive change. This evenings performance features original tracks that promises to hold the audience spellbound and put the band on road to musical stardom and success. Band members: Neil Mansukhani (lyrics/lead vocals), Tiyash Basu (keyboards/back-up vocals), Atanu Sarkar (guitar/back-up vocals), Jeet Brahma (bass guitar), Sourav Banerjee (guitar) and Rohit Roy (drums).

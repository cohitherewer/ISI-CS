                                                                                                               Actress bag stolen
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A designer bag belonging to actress Rituparna Sengupta  containing two cellphones, Rs 10,000 and expensive make-up  was stolen during the promotion of a film produced by her company at a central Calcutta hotel on Tuesday night.        
	According to the complaint lodged by Rituparna at New Market police station, she had kept the bag on a table of the hotels banquet hall before climbing the dais to deliver a short speech. She could not find the bag after returning to the table five minutes later.         
	I was really shocked and surprised. I never expected that such an incident can take place in a famous hotel, Rituparna told Metro.         
	One of the phones rang once and was switched off after that. The other phone is switched off since last night. We will question the hotel employees, said a police officer investigating the case on Wednesday.

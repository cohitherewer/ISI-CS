                                                                                                               Japanese tunes at music address

	J. Reynold amp; Co., one of the oldest music instrument shops in town, will now stock equipment by Roland, the Japanese music major.        
	Established in 1908, the Mirza Ghalib Street address has long been a haunt of amateurs and professionals alike. On Wednesday evening, the store joined hands with Roland to rename its retail outlet the Roland Planet. The Japanese company now has two official outlets in town  the other one is in Kankurgachhi  and has plans for two more showrooms in the city by the year-end.         
	The Reynolds Roland Planet showroom was inaugurated by percussionist and Roland endorsee Bickram Ghosh, who treated the small gathering at the store to a short recital on the popular electronic percussion gadget, the Roland HandSonic.         
	This is one of the best inventions in recent times, he smiled, fusing conga, ghatam and santoor tones with a hint of stormy skies on the laptop-sized gizmo, Its also Rolands most sought-after product.         
	Apart from the HandSonic and the professional series V-Drums  the electronic drumkit that has made waves in the international music circuit  the Roland Planet also offers Boss guitar stomp boxes and effects racks like the GT-10.         
	Primarily known for its keyboards, those with a taste for the black-and-whites can choose from a wide range of tailor-made models, including GW-8 keyboard workstations, E-09 interactive arranger keyboards, organs, digital pianos, V-Accordions and more. Professional studio microphones, personal monitors, amplifiers, DJ gear (including the Sampling Groovebox) and various kick triggers are also available at the store.         
	Opening back-to-back stores in a year frozen by recession may seem surprising to many. But Reynold managing director Peter Remedios and Pradip Agarwal, the head of Rolands distribution in east and north India, are buoyant.         
	Calcutta has always been the backbone of music in this country. We are from Goa, but our family moved to Calcutta decades back when we realised this city was the stronghold of the culture of music and quality musicianship, said Remedios.         
	This city easily boasts the largest number of bands in the country and this young bunch is not pausing to make music because of the downturn.         
	Remedios pointed out that Roland products were only available on the grey market till recently; its time they became available in stores.        
	He also drew attention to the increase in the purchasing power of the younger generation in the last five years. Much of the products in the Rs 20,000-50,000 range are sold instantly. Kids can afford cellphones in that bracket, so why not professional-level keyboards? he smiled.         
	Agarwal agreed. Music doesnt really wait or stop because of financial losses. Calcutta has been a key area on the Roland radar, and its the only metro where music, of all genres, thrives.        
	Its a great thing. When we were younger we couldnt buy this kind of gear. Even if you could afford it, getting someone to buy it and get it over to India was a big deal, says Sudipto Buti Banerjee, a keyboardist with Bangla band Cactus.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Charges fly after college clash
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Charges fly after college clash
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Trinamul Congress bigwigs descended on the violence-scarred Panihati College on Wednesday, prompting SFI leaders to accuse their rivals of stoking tension on the campus.        
	The college erupted in violence on Tuesday over the filing of nominations for the student body polls scheduled for December 10. More than 30 students were injured.        
	Senior Trinamul leaders Mukul Roy and Madan Mitra held a meeting outside the college gate  where Section144 remained clamped for the second consecutive day  protesting the CPMs brutal attack on Trinamul Chhatra Parishad (TCP) supporters.        
	SFI state secretary Kaustav Chatterjee said: They are trying to spread tension and violence. I didnt go there because I know our district leaders are capable enough.... The fact that TCP supporters could not file nominations for all the seats proves that they hardly have any base there.        
	The TCP filed nominations for 56 seats and the SFI for 140 seats. Tuesday was the last day of filing nominations but the violence prompted the administration to extend the deadline by a day.        
	No fresh clash was reported from the college but police sources said the situation was tense on Wednesday. We allowed the students to enter the college after checking their identity cards, said Rahul Srivastava, the superintendent of North 24-Parganas police.        
	The Panihati clash broke out amidst reports from across the state that CPM-backed college principals were not allowing Opposition parties to start students unions on their campuses.

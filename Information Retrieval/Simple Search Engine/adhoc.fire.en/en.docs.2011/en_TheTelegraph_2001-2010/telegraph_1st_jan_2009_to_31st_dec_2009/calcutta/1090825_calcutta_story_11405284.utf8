	Dum Dum Kishore Bharti High Schools Natun Bishshasher Alo was about science doing away with superstition.         
	The play depicts a group of credulous villagers who are made to believe that the secretion from a trees branch was Lord Shivas blessings, until a school teacher explains the reason for the phenomenon.         
	The play stood first, also being selected for best script. Deborshi Roy received the best actor award.         
	Performed in Assamese, Amio Parim was about three girls who, stuck in school during a spell of rain, come across representations of pollution like plastic, who tell them how the callous attitude of humans has damaged the atmosphere.         
	The play, by Maharishi Vidya Mandir Senior Secondary School, Guwahati, fetched Ankita Day the best actress award. Having come second, they will represent the east zone at the national level, with West Bengal, in September.

	When did the universe begin? How do stars die? These were some of the questions Debiprosad Duari, the director of research and academics, MP Birla Planetarium, dealt with at a talk organised by the Advertising Club of Calcutta on August 8 at Oxford Bookstore, on Park Street. Titled Universe in a Nutshell, it commemorated the international year of astronomy.        
	A bunch of astronomy buffs, including students, housewives and senior citizens, listened as Duari explained the 23.5-degree tilt of Earths axis.         
	Its the accidental slant that restores life. It brings about seasons, without which there wouldnt be ocean or air currents, clouds, rains or life. The Earth would be a barren desert, he said.        
	Describing a lunar eclipse, when the moon dons a copper tinge, he spoke about the collision ejecting theory of the moons origin, when early Earth was struck by a large planet and ejected the moon.         
	A slide show also offered glimpses of Chandrayaan I being assembled at Isro, with images of the lunar surface taken from the satellite.         
	Astronomy is a flourishing industry in India now. We possess the largest telescope in the world, as well as the highest observatory. Huge investments are being made to facilitate better research, said Duari about the growing interest in astronomy.         
	The discussion ended with audience questions on subjects like dark matter, the Big Bang Theory and why stars are differently coloured.         
	Somdip Dey, a first year student of computer science, said: I was always interested in astrophysics but couldnt take it up in college as I did not have enough marks. Todays session will help me, as I want to take up astrophysics after I graduate.

	Class VI student Syed Faizen Ahmad could not wait to make use of his new knowledge. From now on, if I see any wrongdoing in my locality, I will lodge a complaint at the police station without any misgiving, he said.         
	We want to reach out to the community through children, explained police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti.         
	Students from various schools, such as Birla High School for Boys and St James School, showed interest in building bridges with our men in uniform, said Imran Zaki, the president of Faces.

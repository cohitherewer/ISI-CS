The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Raise the creative bar
                                                                                                               Raise the creative bar
                                  
	New ventures also formed the core of the presentation by Jay A. Levenson, the director of international program at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), New York. Since the program was founded in 1952, MoMA has organised shows with India, and now intends to deepen its collaboration.        
	KMOMA is expected to transform curating, preservation and the circulation of Indian art. To facilitate this process, MoMA wishes to start exchange programmes with India, enabling curators working here to exchange ideas with their US counterparts.        
	A cultural dialogue of this kind must coexist with adventurous thinking. Jyotindra Jain, a professor at the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts, New Delhi, began his address by quoting the photographer, Dayanita Singh, who had once mentioned her search for alternative spaces to display her work. When she showed some portraits in peoples houses, neighbours came to watch, and engaged with the exhibits at a level of rare intimacy. So the modern museum must be a fluid space, straddling public and private spheres, making the one inseparable from the other.        
	Holding together these visions for a futuristic museum was an overarching awareness of the role of the corporate sector. While conceding that art cannot get sidetracked by financial indices, Rakhi Sarkar, the head of the FICCI Committee on Art and Business of Art and managing trustee of KMOMA, lobbied for a change of policies that control the Indian art market. Mukesh Panika, director, Religare Arts Initiative, New Delhi, also highlighted the positives of corporate participation.        
	Artist Subodh Gupta was the guest of honour.

Freed from red clutter, multi-coloured flags flutter          OUR BUREAU                            Late on Tuesday, cops forced the Citu workers to remove all protest flags and posters from the HHI entrance.

	The state government, slammed by the high court for going soft on the Citu protest platform in front of a star hotel despite an earlier order, scrambled to escape contempt on Wednesday.        
	By 10.30am  the deadline set by the court on Tuesday afternoon for all Citu protesters and protest material to be removed from the Hotel Hindusthan International (HHI) premises  the entrance to the AJC Bose Road hospitality address wore a squeaky clean look.        
	The red flags and festoons of protest cluttering the entrance till Tuesday evening had been replaced by fluttering multi-coloured flags that the hotel management puts up to enhance the look.        
	The court prod prompted police to act late on Tuesday. The agitating employees of the Citu-affiliated Karmachari Union were made to remove all posters and banners from the hotels entrance.        
	The high courts order and the action thereafter is welcome news for business as a whole in this state. There have been so many instances where the unions have been disruptive and destructive. But this time an example has been set, said a spokesperson for the hotel. The HHI management had moved court complaining that the union agitation was inconveniencing guests and affecting business.        
	On Tuesday, Justice Sanjib Banerjee had given the city police and state home secretary Ardhendu Sen till 10.30am to remove protesters and their protest platform from HHI or face contempt proceedings.        
	On Wednesday, soon after Justice Banerjee took his chair, the lawyers representing the state said their client had carried out the court order.                  Protest posters removed from the HHI gate and dumped below the flyover       
	Advocate Arunava Ghosh, appearing for the hotel management, then informed the court that the police had arrived around 11.30pm on Tuesday and directed the Karmachari Union members to remove all protest posters and placards from the gate. After hearing both the sides, the judge disposed of the matter.        
	Citu vice-president Mohammad Nizamuddin remained defiant. Its unfortunate that the court has issued such an order favouring the hotel owners and not the workers.... Even if flags and posters are removed, our agitation for the rights of hotel workers will continue, he said.        
	Citus rival chose to take a soft line. Trade union activity has to be done in a responsible manner and not by affecting the interest of the very trade with which workers are associated. Putting up flags and posters outside a hotel can affect its business and image, said Intuc president Subrata Mukherjee, whose own track record of agitation down the decades has often been far from responsible.        
	The court showing the ruling partys labour wing its place  not within 50 metres of the business establishment  was cheered in business circles. This is a positive development, said Sandipan Chakrovorty, the chairman of CII eastern region.

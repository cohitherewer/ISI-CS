										      Calcuttan of the Week                        A container ship				                           
	Name: Aparajita Ray (picture below)        
	Age: 26        
	Claim to fame: She is one of the very few woman marine engineers the city has produced, holding her own in a profession still considered a male bastion. A graduate of Tolani Maritime Institute in Pune, Aparajita is currently a fourth engineer. She has sailed across the world on a 33,750 gross tonnage container ship, riding the high seas seven months at a stretch.         
	Job profile:Our job is to ensure the operation and smooth functioning of the ship machinery and carry out regular maintenance work, says the spunky chaar saab (as fourth engineers are called on ship). The job gives me hands-on experience with heavy machinery. It takes me weeks then to get the grease marks off my hands after I return home, she smiles. Every ship has different machinery and its own unique problems, and she loves the challenge, she says.           
	Why shipping? Thats a question I have to answer a lot, Aparajita smiles. Her father, a former mariner, is her inspiration. I grew up hearing about my fathers experiences and wonderful tales of far-off lands from my mother and elder sister, who had sailed with him. So I always wanted to sail.        
	It was also the desire to do something different from a 9 to 5 job that set her sailing.         
	On board: The going is not easy, admits Aparajita. The mindset that I am intruding into male territory is definitely there. On her last ship, she was the only woman along with 23 men. Initially seniors would treat me with kid gloves. Even the crew were hesitant to call me chaar saab. I not only had to prove myself as a good engineer, but also that I am as good as any male fourth engineer. But by the end of her contract I was one of them.         
	Perks: It may be a tough life, but there are positives. Last year I visited Italy, Spain, France, the US, Canada, Mexico and Dubai, smiles the travel freak. I fell in love with Mexican food and crossed the Panama canal. And I shopped a lot, too, she adds.         
	I have worked with people of different nationalities, and each experience has helped me grow as a person. We had a few British and Sri Lankan officers on my last ship and I found them much more professional and welcoming than my Indian seniors, she says.         
	Future plans: I want to continue sailing and finish my sea time for becoming a second engineer. And then I want to become a chief engineer, she says with confidence.         
	Parting shot: Yes, it is a hard life out in the sea, but its tough for the guys too. At the end of the day, I am doing nothing extraordinary, Im just doing my job, she signs off.       SAMHITA L.

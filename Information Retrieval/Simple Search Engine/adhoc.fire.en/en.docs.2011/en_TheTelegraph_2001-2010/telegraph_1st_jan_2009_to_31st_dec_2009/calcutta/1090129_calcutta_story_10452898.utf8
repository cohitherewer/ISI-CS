The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Airport inquiry 
                                                                                                               Airport inquiry 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has ordered an inquiry into the jamming of all air traffic control (ATC) frequencies at Calcutta airport on Tuesday following glitches in communication with a Jet Airways flight. The snag had raised fears of mid-air collisions.        
	During the inquiry, DGCA officials will rerun the tape that recorded the voice communication between the Jet pilot and the ATC. The inquiry is likely to be completed in a week.        
	Officials said a flaw in the communication equipment of the Bangkok-Calcutta Jet craft caused the jamming but the airline put the blame on the ATC.        
	Quick switching of communication frequencies and safe distance between aircraft helped avert an air disaster.         
	An inquiry has been ordered to find out what exactly happened, said H.N. Mishra, the air safety officer of DGCAs eastern region.         
	Some reports suggest that the Jet aircraft had suffered a snag in its communication system and repairs were carried out after it landed in Calcutta. Jet Airways has been asked to provide details of the rectification, Mishra said.        
	On Tuesday, Jet Airways had argued that had there been a glitch in the aircraft, it couldnt have taken off smoothly for Bangkok at 11.45am.

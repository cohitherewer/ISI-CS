The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Corporal summons to schools
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Corporal summons to schools
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta High Court has issued summons to the heads of two schools where corporal punishment allegedly claimed lives and cracked the whip on the government for not doing anything to prevent such incidents.        
	Why isnt the government paying heed to such a serious problem? Corporal punishment in educational institutions should be stopped at any cost, the division bench of Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya and Justice K.K. Prasad said on Friday.        
	The bench gave the director of school education, Dibyen Basu, a week to file an affidavit stating the steps taken so far to stop corporal punishment in schools. If he fails to carry out the order, he will have to be present in court on December 11, it said.        
	The court asked the headmistress of Bidya Bharati School in Mominpur, where Class II student Iftesham Chowdhury died last year after being allegedly slapped so hard by her yoga teacher that her head rammed against a wall, to be present at the December 11 hearing.         
	Summons were also issued to the headmistress of Andal Girls High School in Burdwan, where 11-year-old Babli Ghosh died of a head injury suffered on May 14 this year when her class teacher allegedly threw a duster at her.         
	Going by a 2006 court ruling, the accused in such cases are to be booked under Section 304 but are usually charged under Section 304A and granted bail. Section 304A carries a maximum jail sentence of two years while Section 304 warrants a life term (up to 14 years).        
	Advocate Tapas Bhanja had moved court earlier this year seeking to know what the government had done to curb corporal punishment in the eight years since it was banned.

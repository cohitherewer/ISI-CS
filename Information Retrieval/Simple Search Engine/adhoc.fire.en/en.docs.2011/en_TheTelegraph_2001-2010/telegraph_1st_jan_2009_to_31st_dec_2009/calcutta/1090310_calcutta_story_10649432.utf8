The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Colour code for city
                                                                                                               Colour code for city
          A STAFF REPORTER                                         
	Lalbazar has asked all 48 police stations in the city to step up vigil to ensure a trouble-free Holi.   
	The cops have been asked to take action against any individual or group indulging in excesses during the celebrations on Wednesday, including forcible use of colours and rowdy behaviour in public places.        
	Around 5,000 policemen would fan out across the city and keep an eye on revellers. Thirty-one teams of motorcycle-borne officers will be deployed in the city and officers of the disaster management group will man all city ghats, said Jawed Shamim, the city detective chief.        
	Though the restrictions come into effect on Wednesday, the cops have been asked to ensure that bonfires are not lit on thoroughfares on Tuesday night. There should also be no use of inflammable materials like petrol or tyres to burn the Holika.        
	With drunken brawls and teasing topping the Holi crime chart in the city, each deputy commissioner of police has been put in charge of two to three police stations and around 60 radio flying squads have been asked to patrol the city. Around 300 pickets would be set up and cops would take action against any person or group trying to dunk pedestrians from highrise buildings.        
	All complaints relating to forcible use of colours would have to be attended to immediately by the duty officer of each police station.         
	We held discussions with committees of highrise buildings and briefed them on how to celebrate the festival of colours in a decent and peaceful manner, said a senior officer of Bhowanipore police station.         
	This year the use of loudspeakers will be banned during Holi because of the ongoing board exams. Anyone found violating the ban will be arrested, said cops.        
	The police are also focusing on hotels and guest houses. All officers have been asked to scan hotels and guest houses and maintain a list of visitors checking in on the eve of the festival, said a police officer.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Six armed robbers, chased by a mob, barged into a house in Titagarh late on Tuesday and shot dead the homemaker after she identified one of them.        
	Sumitra Sau, 52, a former employee of Titagarh Jute Mill, was taken to BN Bose Hospital in Barrackpore where she was declared dead on arrival. Doctors said she had been shot in the chest.        
	Two of the gang members  Suraj Shaw, who the woman identified, and Mansukha  have been arrested, an officer.        
	Sumitra was jolted out of her sleep when the six armed youths, chased by a mob from an adjacent locality where they had gone to rob a house, broke open the door of her house and barged in.        
	The woman stepped out of her room and on seeing Suraj, a local youth, called out his name. That set off panic among the robbers who killed the woman before rushing out, said the officer.        
	Residents, led by a few Trinamul leaders, blocked Netaji Subhas Road which links Titagarh to BT Road for more than an hour in the afternoon, demanding immediate arrest of the culprits.         
	A Rapid Action Force team was deployed in the area and the blockade was lifted after senior officers promised action.        
	Four bullets and as many firearms were seized from the arrested duo, said Rahul Srivastava, the superintendent of North 24-Parganas police.         
	Sumitra leaves behind husband Ayodhya Prasad and two sons and two daughters.

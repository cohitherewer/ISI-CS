           Kiss case: Apropos All-rounder ducks bodyline attack of admirers, August 18, the kiss-and-miss act of Sabina Khatun appears to have been stage-managed.                                       
	The smuggling of medicines and equipment out of a reputed government hospital like Nilratan Sircar Medical College by the nurse-in-charge with the help of some hospital employees is a matter of shame for the healthcare system of the state (Chief nurse held in medical scam, July 25).             
	Bengals healthcare system is far from satisfactory. If medicines meant for the poor are stolen from state hospitals, needy patients will be deprived of lifesaving drugs.           
	The report reveals that the racket was in operation for quite sometime. It is strange that the hospital authorities were not aware of it. Strict vigil needs to be kept over the stock of medicines and equipment received by a hospital and their disbursement to different wards or departments.           
	Medicines and equipment should be released for use against proper requisition slips signed by the medical authorities. A certificate of proper utilisation of medicines, injections etc, should be furnished daily by the nurse-in-charge of each ward/department.

	The state government has failed to enforce the passenger limit on autos (Green no guarantee for smoke-free ride, August 6). When the designed capacity is three and the Contract Carriage Act lays down the law, why is the rule allowed to be violated? The norm is followed in other metros, but in Calcutta the government does little to curb the ingenious fittings that enable autos to carry more passengers. Let the current focus on green autos be a wake-up call on the matter in its entirety, and let not vote-bank politics come in the way of what is good for citizens.

	Apropos the report Fight against fare and fume (July 28), the story narrated by Pradip Basu may be shocking but, unfortunately, not uncommon. The atrocities of auto-drivers are on the rise. In some areas, auto-drivers demand extra money, even double the fare at night. Commuters are forced to pay up. The police are aware but choose to be onlookers.

	With reference to Circle of Metro commute, July 29, I feel the survey should also include a double pair of tracks to connect Barasat and Barrackpore. The proposed new tracks on the entire route should be served only by Metro railway and not by EMU. This would lead to seamless connectivity, more comfort for passengers, and improved profitability through assured realisation of fares. I suggest two sets of circular train routes, running in opposite directions, be introduced: one to cover the Barrackpore-Barasat-Noapara route; the other to connect Dum Dum-Rajarhat-Garia-Tollygunge-Esplanade-Dum Dum.

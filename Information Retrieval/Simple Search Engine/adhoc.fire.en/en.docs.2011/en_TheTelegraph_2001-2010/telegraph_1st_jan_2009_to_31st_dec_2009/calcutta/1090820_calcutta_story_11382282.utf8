The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tease trio elude cops
                                                                                                               Tease trio elude cops
  - Plea for security ignored, students gherao police station          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Police are yet to trace the three youths who harassed girls on their way to school in a pool car and shot at the driver in Metiabruz on Tuesday morning.         
	The students and teachers of Keshoram Cotton Mills High School, where the girls study, gheraoed Metiabruz police station on Wednesday afternoon demanding immediate arrest of the culprits.         
	We are scared as the trio are roaming free. Our students are feeling unsafe, said headmaster C.L. Singh, who was in the group that laid siege to the police station.         
	School sources said five of the 11 students who were in the pool car and witnessed the firing did not turn up on Wednesday out of fear.        
	Singh said Tuesdays incident was waiting to happen as the police had ignored several pleas by the school authorities over the past two years to step up security in the neighbourhood.         
	Our pleas to intensify patrolling (around the school) have fallen on deaf ears. Every three months we send a reminder but officers dont care. Yesterdays teasing and firing could have been averted had the police been more active, said Singh.         
	Students often complain to the authorities that some youths make obscene gestures at them while they are on their way to school or back home.         
	Asked why security was not being stepped up, deputy commissioner (port) Asit Pal said: The school is under South 24-Parganas police. They should answer your question.        
	Sunil Chaudhury, the additional superintendent of South 24-Parganas police, said the road where the driver was shot at was under Calcutta police. Why are you asking me instead of the city police? he shot back.         
	A senior officer said security on the road was the responsibility of Garden Reach police station which falls under the city police while one of the pavements was looked after by Metiabruz police of South 24-Parganas. Ideally, officers of both police stations should arrange for joint patrolling.        
	A probe revealed that the tease trio were riding a stolen motorcycle. We traced the owner to Budge Budge with the help of the engine and chassis numbers. The owner said his bike was stolen on May 30, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters).         
	Police artists are trying to draw sketches of the three youths based on the descriptions provided by some of the girls in the pool car.

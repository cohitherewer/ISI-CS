The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Four held for dowry death 
                                                                                                               Four held for dowry death 
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A 22-year-old homemaker committed suicide by consuming poison at her Maniktala home late on Thursday, just four months after her wedding.        
	Tumpa Dass in-laws found her frothing at the mouth in the verandah and rushed her to a hospital, where she died.        
	Her husband Subrata, in-laws Dhananjoy and Kalpana and married sister-in-law Sukla Bhowmik were arrested after Tumpas brother Kamal Barik lodged a complaint accusing them of torturing Tumpa for dowry.        
	My mother had visited Tumpas house on Thursday and was insulted by her in-laws. Later in the night, Tumpa committed suicide, Kamal told the police.        
	A case of death due to dowry under Section 304B and cruelty by husband or his relatives under Section 498A has been registered against the four, said a police officer.        
	The post-mortem suggests the woman consumed poison, said Jawed Shamim, the city detective chief.        
	Subrata, 35, married Tumpa on February 21. He works for a security guard agency and his family allegedly took Rs 20,000 from Tumpas parents for the marriage, apart from gold and utensils.         
	Of late, Tumpas in-laws had been pressing for a bed and her parents were trying to arrange for one. But her mothers insult probably drove her to suicide, said an officer.        
	Her husband was not home when she consumed poison but that doesnt leave him out of the list of accused, he added.

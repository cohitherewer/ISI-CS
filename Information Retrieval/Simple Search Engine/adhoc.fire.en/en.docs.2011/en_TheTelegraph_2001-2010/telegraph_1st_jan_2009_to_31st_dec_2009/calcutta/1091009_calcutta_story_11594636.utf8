The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Metro suffers 3-hr hitch
                                                                                                               Metro suffers 3-hr hitch
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Metro Railways reliability quotient dipped for the second time in a week with a snag-hit rake stalling services on the newly extended route for nearly three hours and in the old section for 45 minutes.        
	As if Thursday mornings disruptions werent embarrassing enough for the authorities, smoke billowed out of the damaged rake while it was being taken to the Noapara shed for repairs, triggering panic among passengers.         
	Officials of Metro Railway, facing flak for slips galore since the inauguration of the Tollygunge-Kavi Nazrul (Garia Bazar) route on August 23, claimed there were no passengers on the train when the rake started spewing smoke at Rabindra Sarobar station.        
	But a source in one of the technical departments revealed that the train did have passengers when the incident occurred around 10.45am. The passengers were asked to get off the train before it proceeded towards Noapara again. The snag-hit rake caused damage to the third rail along the way, he said.        
	Services between Tollygunge (Mahanayak Uttam Kumar) and Kavi Nazrul were stalled from 10.30am to 1.20pm, while the Tollygunge-Dum Dum section remained out of bounds for trains from 11am to 11.45am, a Metro spokesperson said.         
	Abhinava Majumdar, headed for Camac Street in the morning to appear for an interview, was delayed by the disruption.         
	I had just reached Bansdroni (Masterda Surjya Sen) station when there was an announcement that trains wouldnt run on that section for some time. An official advised me to catch a train from Tollygunge but services were stalled in that section as well by the time I reached the station by auto. I was late for the interview, said the 23-year-old resident of Netaji Nagar, on the southern fringes.        
	For many passengers, it was not the first time in recent weeks that Metro Railway had left them stranded. There is a problem every other day, and the timings have gone haywire, said Reshmi Sengupta, a post-graduate student of Calcutta University who missed a class on Thursday.        
	Deluged by complaints, Metro Railway general manager V.K. Tripathy ordered an inquiry by a three-member committee.         
	On October 1, passengers were forced to scurry out of a south-bound train at Girish Park station after smoke billowed out from the undercarriage of a rake. Officials said the rake that triggered smoke on Thursday was around 25 years old.        
	According to a preliminary probe, trouble started during the morning rush hour when a train that had arrived at Kavi Nazrul from Dum Dum was changing tracks for the return journey at Shahid Khudiram (Birji), the station to which only empty rakes go.        
	 One of the current collectors of the snag-hit rake caused the third rail near Birji station to shift alignment, triggering a chain reaction. If the alignment of the third rail changes, the rakes behind the one that causes the problem dont receive power supply, explained an official.        
	While emergency repairs enabled the train to return to Kavi Nazrul station, the authorities were forced to switch off power supply to the Tollygunge-Kavi Nazrul section to fully repair the third rail. The rake responsible for the disruption was, meanwhile, damaging the third rail in parts of the old section as well.         
	Each rake has two third-rail current collectors on either side, and the one that malfunctioned grazed the third rail throughout the journey back to Dum Dum and then Noapara, an official said.        
	The train, emptied of passengers at Rabindra Sarobar, halted for more than a couple of minutes at various stations. Around 11am, power supply between Maidan and Central was disrupted following a short circuit caused by friction between the damaged current collector and the third rail.

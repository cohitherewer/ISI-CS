The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Voters cry bias as names struck off list
                                                                                                               Voters cry bias as names struck off list
          OUR BUREAU                      A BSF jawan frisks a voter in Metiabruz. (Pradip Sanyal)                          
	Fifty voters at the Chakraberia High School polling station in Calcutta South were not allowed to exercise their franchise on the ground that their names had been deleted from the list.        
	The group of 50, however, denied that their names had been struck off and accused the presiding officer and the CPM of deliberately preventing them from casting their votes.        
	All of them claimed that they had produced valid identity documents, including EPIC cards.        
	This is a conspiracy of the CPM. My elder brother and I live in the same house in Chakraberia as our parents. While our parents were allowed to cast their votes, my brother and I were turned away, said Dipak.        
	Jhantu Dutta met with the same fate when he turned up at the Chakraberia school. I was supposed to cast my vote at booth 135A. But the presiding officer told me that my name had been struck off the list following a change in my address. I am living in the same house as before. My parents, however, could cast their votes, recalled Dutta.        
	Chanda Singh, among those who were not allowed to vote, said: Local CPM leaders know about our political affiliation and hence, tampered with the electoral list.        
	A resident of Wood Street was in for a similar shock when he went to cast his vote at St Xaviers School. He was told that his name had been deleted from the list but was not given any reason.        
	The names might have gone off the roles inadvertently. Theres no reason to suspect foul play in all such cases. It is unfortunate, but true. Theres no way such voters can vote this time. They have to wait for the annual revision to the electoral rolls, said chief electoral officer Debashis Sen.        
	Sen clarified that the annual revision take place after Puja in Bengal every year and the process continues for four weeks.        
	The commission expects every voter to visit the venue where the list is updated and verify whether his/her name figures on it.        
	If the name is not there on the list, he/she must point it out to the officials present and carry out their instructions. The process is simple and the name can be reinserted in no time. Its faster for those who have voter ID cards, Sen said.

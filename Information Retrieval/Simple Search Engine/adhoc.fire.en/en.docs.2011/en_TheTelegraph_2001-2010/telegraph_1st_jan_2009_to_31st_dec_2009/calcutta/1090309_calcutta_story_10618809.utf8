The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Organs dissected to revive cancer patient
                                                                                                               Organs dissected to revive cancer patient
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 48-year-old cancer patient has undergone a rare surgery in which six organs and structures were dissected to give him a fresh lease of life.         
	Sailesh Mahapatra, a homoeopath from Tamluk in East Midnapore, is a patient of retroperitoneal sarcoma (abdominal cancer).        
	He had been suffering from abdominal pain for over six months and was diagnosed with cancer  which had advanced to stage III and spread to multiple organs  in August 2008.        
	We took him to Mumbai but doctors said the cancer had spread to multiple organs and they could only prescribe palliatives to lessen the pain, said Satyesh, his elder brother.         
	In Calcutta, however, doctors held out hope. The abdominal mass had grown despite chemotherapy and spread to the main vessel carrying blood from the heart, said Shaikat Gupta, a surgical oncologist at Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, who lead the team of doctors that conducted a 12-hour surgery on Mahapatra on January 14.        
	Mahapatras left kidney, spleen, 90 per cent of the pancreas, left colon, left diaphragm, muscles in the back of the abdomen (where the tumour had originated) and the outer layer of the blood vessel were dissected.         
	The surgery was risky but the patient survived, said Gupta. Though it was a prolonged surgery, blood loss was minimal. Doctors said only four units of blood were transfused during the operation. Mahapatra will now undergo radiotherapy.         
	I had lost hope for life. But now I can walk without support and feel better, said Mahapatra. Wife Deepali and their 11-year-old son, Pritam, are happy and relieved. He was bedridden and was in unbearable pain. But now things seem to be improving, said Deepali.        
	According to doctors, surgery is difficult in cases where cancer spreads to more than six organs. It was a complicated surgery. In most cases, such patients are beyond the stage of surgery, said city-based surgical oncologist Gautam Mukhopadhyay. Referring to Mahapatras case, he said: When cancer spreads to so many organs, the prognosis is uncertain.

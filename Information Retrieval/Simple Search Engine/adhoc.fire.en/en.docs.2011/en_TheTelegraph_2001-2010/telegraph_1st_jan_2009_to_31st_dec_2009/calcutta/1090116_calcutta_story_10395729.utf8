The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CBI seeks time in   Riz case
                                                                                                               CBI seeks time in   Riz case
          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	The CBI on Thursday sought more time from the city sessions court to open proceedings in the Rizwanur Rahman death case.        
	Sources in the investigating agency said opening the proceedings by its lawyer would amount to starting the trial, which the Supreme Court has stayed.         
	The stay order will remain valid till the appeals moved by the Todis  accused in the case  in the high court challenging the validity of the chargesheets against them are disposed of.        
	Six of the seven accused were present in the courtroom when a CBI lawyer pleaded for time. Ashok Todi, the father-in-law of Rizwanur whose body was found beside the railway tracks in Patipukur on September 21, 2007, could not be produced because of health reasons.        
	A CBI official later explained that pressing for the acceptance of the charges in the court might have been considered as trial, inviting a contempt of court charge.        
	CBI sources in Delhi said the arrest of Partha Sarathi Bose, the deputy superintendent of police (east zone) who was investigating the case, on charges of corruption has forced the agency to go slow.        
	The Left parties are keeping a watch on the developments besides pressing for the inclusion of Trinamul leader Javed Ahmed Khans name in the list of accused, said a CBI official.        
	The judge asked the accused to appear on January 28. A three-judge bench of the Supreme Court will hear the bail plea by Ashok Todi on Friday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Downturn made easy
                                                                                                               Downturn made easy

	Sir Alexander James Mirrlees was at the right place, at the right time. At least for all of us, poor non-economists of the third world, who are regularly being fed news of pink slips and suicides in the first world.         
	When America catches a cold (the US has a new name after Obamas inaugural speech), the whole world sneezes. So even if people in the land of opportunities lose jobs every day, Indian companies like Jet Airways here are forced to welcome back with open arms and flowing tears those it tries to sack in a matter of hours. Its hard to retrench in a third world country like India. Though company directors might defraud investors, cook up accounts books and go to jail, but they cant retrench!         
	So to have a Keynesian economist explain that terrible thing called economic downturn, the phrase that has replaced the more commonly known economic depression, is a bonus that the Book Fair has doled out with the help of British Council in collaboration with the Institute of Development Studies, Calcutta.         
	Sir James, a Scottish economist and the winner of the 1996 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, delivered a lecture on Bad markets in crisis: Incentives for loans and investments to a packed audience at Taj Bengals Crystal Room, who was first led to a well-laid platter of high tea. Hardly signs of a recession!         
	Sir James then spoke on how the American mortgage companies picked up bad debtors who defaulted and the whole housing industry came collapsing like a pack of cards. At the interactive session, when pointedly asked what all this meant for India, Sir James was optimistic, saying: I dont see India getting affected too much because a majority of the expat remittances for India comes from the Gulf, which is not too badly affected till now.         
	Well thats some good news in a long time!                    ANASUYA BASU

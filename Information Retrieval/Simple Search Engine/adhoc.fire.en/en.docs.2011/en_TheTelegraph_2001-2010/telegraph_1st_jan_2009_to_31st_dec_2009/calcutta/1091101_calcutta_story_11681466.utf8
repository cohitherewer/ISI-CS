										      caleidoscope                        A still from Bilal                          
	There is a sudden burst of light inside the 4x10ft shanty in Taltala, but its owners Shamim and Humera remain in perpetual darkness. They are blind. Humera Begums worry right then is that her three-year old son Bilal might accidentally touch the wires. But Bilal is sighted and smarter than his years. He is the mainstay of his parents lives.        
	Through Sourav Sarangis camera one sees Bilal hunting out the sugar tin or helping his parents cross the street. He sometimes turns to the camera with those large dark twinkling eyes that are both innocent and brave.         
	Bilal, screened last week at Max Mueller Bhavan, could be Bengals Slumdog Millionaire. It has won over a dozen awards in 2009, including a Silver Ace at the Las Vegas International Film Festival. Funded by the Dutch IDFA Jan Vrijman Fund, this tale of survival was difficult to shoot because the crew had to be stationed within Shamims shanty. Perhaps because Shamim and Humera are actors with the Blind Opera and know Sourav, they did not object to the venture. The film, shot over 14 months with a three-member crew, was whittled down to the 88-minute short on the editors table.                   Actor Dev at British Council on Friday as part of Customer Service Week celebrated by the organisation between October 26 and 30 in its centres across India and Sri Lanka. The Poran Jaye Joliya Re star interacted with participants and gave away prizes for various events organised through the week. Picture by Aranya Sen      
	The film details the Taltala milieu, the ajaan from the mosque, the daily squabbles within the family and neighbours and the support of other families during hard times. Jharna, who married Shamim and became Humera Begum, feels Shamims naivete allowed the local party and police officials to rob them of their main source of income  the Bilal STD booth.         
	Smoke and fire        
	At a press meet on obesity recently smokers felt the heat. When questions were invited, a woman reporter put her hand up. But the doctor on the panel butted in. If youre a smoker, dont bother to ask questions concerned with obesity or anything health-related, he ranted. You people (reporters) smoke the most, and smoking causes more deaths than anything else! An awkward silence descended. Wouldnt suggesting ways of quitting be better than extinguishing smokers?                   Dancer Sanchita Bhattacharya performs at an event at Stadel.

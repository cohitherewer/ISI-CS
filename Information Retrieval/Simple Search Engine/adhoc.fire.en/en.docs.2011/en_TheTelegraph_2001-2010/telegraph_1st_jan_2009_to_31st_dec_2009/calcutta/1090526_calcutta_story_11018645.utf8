The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | There she blows   Mid-air prayers and shots on the ground
                                                                                                               There she blows 
  Mid-air prayers and shots on the ground    - I heard the howling wind amp; pounding rain										      
	Metro presents the first-person accounts of three Calcuttans who felt the Aila effect  on water, in mid-air and on land.              
	A seaman on board a commercial vessel anchored off the Sagar coast (see map).        
	We had received a storm warning for Monday and were prepared for it when the storm broke around 2.30pm. Wind speed of around 120kmph lashed the ship and there was swelling in the sea.        
	Earlier in the day, dark clouds hung over the horizon and in the afternoon, they closed in fast, bringing blinding rain. Since we were in anchorage, our main concern was to ensure that the swelling sea didnt snap the anchor and wash us ashore or further into the high sea. To prevent that, the engine of the ship is kept on stand-by and a mechanism called stabilising is activated, to counter the force of the wind and water and prevent the vessel from moving.        
	During such weather, we are advised not to venture to the deck except in an emergency. We have to take safety precautions like wearing a lifejacket and attaching a lifeline to our body.         
	Sitting in my cabin, I could hear the howl of the winds and the pounding rain. Through the porthole, in the far distance, I could see trees on the shore doubling up under the impact of the wind and rain.         
	The weather improved by evening and around 6.30pm, the wind speed started dropping and the rain reduced to a drizzle. We got reports that there had been no damage to any of the commercial vessels anchored in the area.        
	When in anchorage, our only way of getting ashore is with small dinghies and launches, which were not allowed to ply today. Choppers, used by senior superintendents to visit a ship, were also not allowed in such weather.        
	This was, however, a relatively mild storm, compared to the cyclones and tornadoes a multi-tonne vessel is designed to withstand. So, we didnt face rolling or pitching. In the South China Sea, which is notorious for its weather, cyclones of 220kmph are common.               
	A passenger on board Kingfisher IT 511, from Mumbai to Calcutta.        
	The flight took off at 6.20am and was to land at 9am. Trouble started 40 minutes before landing. There were dark clouds all around and we were facing turbulence. The pilot announced through the public address system: We are facing turbulent weather. Please dont get up from your seats, and fasten the seat belts. The cabin crew ensured that all seat belts were fastened.                                 
	Outside there were only dark clouds. It seemed as if we had entered the Black Hole and at times the aircraft, although a new one, was shaking and shuddering. I am a regular flier but never have I experienced such a bumpy ride.        
	About 15 minutes before landing, there was continuous turbulence for seven to eight minutes, leaving us even more scared. A co-passenger complained of uneasiness and was about to throw up.        
	Thick clouds enveloped the aircraft till it started descending. Then it started raining very hard and water was splashing against the window.        
	From above, I could see the storm wreaking havoc. The coconut trees around the airport were bending till what seemed was snapping point.        
	I prayed silently for a safe landing and the pilot did land very smoothly.               
	An officegoer in a taxi, headed from Ballygunge Circular Road to Dalhousie        
	Stepped out from home and into the sharky jaws of a huge uprooted tree. Branches so big, room for me to squat and squeeze through to the other side.        
	Telephone poles dangling at a twisted angle. The uprooted pavement socket so slimy and slippery. Scared to touch anything.        
	At the mouth of Dover Road another tree. Drivers using that special Calcutta skill of straddling the pavement to park. One half of the cab on kerb and the other on road, you have that skidding feeling in slow motion. Used to smirk at the funny parking habit. Now grateful.        
	Bang in front of Ballygunge military camp. A tree at 40 degree angle, fallen spreadeagled across the street. Soldiers around. We have to turn back. Trees and leaves all around. Looks like Myanmar.        
	No sign of traffic police. So, everyone going around in circles. Had a traffic constable diverted the flow from St Lawrence School, things could have been much smoother. People are now groping in the dark and driving into cul de sac created by fallen trees. Some roads are clear but no one knows which one. The police could have sorted it out.        
	Perfect strangers knocking on taxi window and pleading to share cabs. Has the transport system collapsed? Angry people banging on cab door demanding to be let in. The bus stop crowd has swelled and is spilling over on to the road. A narrow gap left for vehicles.        
	Full of people on one side of the road. I counted at least 10 asking to be let into the cab. People shouting.        
	Have you suffered any damage in the storm? Tell ttmetroabpmail.com

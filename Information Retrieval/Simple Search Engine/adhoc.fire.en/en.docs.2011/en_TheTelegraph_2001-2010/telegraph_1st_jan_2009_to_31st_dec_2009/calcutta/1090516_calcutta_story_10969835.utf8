                                                                                                               Court axe on billboards
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court in an interim order on Friday asked the CMDA to remove all illegal billboards on both sides of the EM Bypass and VIP Road by Monday.        
	Justice Sanjib Banerjee also asked the CMDA to serve notices to the advertising agencies that it had allowed to erect billboards along the two arteries. According to government sources, close to 99 per cent of the billboards are illegal as the CMDA did not float tenders before allowing them to be set up.         
	The order was passed on a petition by advertising agency Selvel, which alleged that the CMDA had flouted norms while allowing other companies to erect billboards along the two roads.        
	The petitioner company claimed that the state government had approved of the CMDAs move, which the state lawyer denied.        
	The CMDA had decided to allow the companies to erect billboards on the two roads, said a state lawyer.        
	The judge asked the lawyer whether the CMDA had the right to allow private companies to erect billboards without floating tenders.        
	The judge also asked them whether the CMDA could take money from the private companies by allowing them to erect billboards without the approval of the CMC, which controls the plots beside the Bypass.        
	The hearing will resume on Monday, when the advertising agencies that have erected billboards on the two roads present their stand on the issue.

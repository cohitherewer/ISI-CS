The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | IT inputs to tackle calamity
                                                                                                               IT inputs to tackle calamity
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The administrative body of Salt Lake Sector V will hear out representatives of IT firms before chalking out a strategy to tackle the fallout of Aila-like calamities.        
	The industry captains, who will meet the Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority on June 2, are expected to air their views on how to restore emergency services like water and power immediately after a calamity.        
	The effect of last weeks storm was not so severe in Sector V. Only a few trees were uprooted and power went off for a brief period. But it has highlighted the need for a comprehensive disaster-management plan. The meeting with industry representatives will also throw up crucial inputs for formulation of the strategy, said S.A. Ahmed, the chairman of the authority.        
	With monsoon having entered Bengal ahead of schedule, Ahmed and his team have also decided to coordinate with various departments to tackle waterlogging and other seasonal infrastructural problems.        
	The garbage vats lining the Sector V roads will be replaced with big plastic bags that will be cleared every morning, said an official of the authority.        
	The June 2 meeting will also deal with ways to curb the mushrooming of roadside stalls. The authority is planning to allow only a limited number of stalls in designated pockets. The stalls will not be allowed to encroach on the footpaths.        
	There are around 250 hawkers in Sector V who have set up stalls indiscriminately, violating all rules. We want to streamline the system by setting a limit to the number of stalls. Besides, the stalls will have to be set up in such a way that they are not an affront to the eye, the official added.        
	The industry captains, keeping fingers crossed on the outcome of the meeting, are open to paying a token amount for some tailor-made services.        
	The industry needs infrastructural support from the authority. I dont think the companies will mind paying a small amount for some special services. The state should try and meet some of the expectations of the IT industry, said Kalyan Kar, the managing director of Acclaris.

	Milon Mela looks far from ready a week before the seasons first big fair, belying the governments claim on Tuesday that infrastructure had been upgraded.         
	The infrastructure at Milon Mela is ready. The land filling is over and the roads, toilets and the drainage facilities as well as the food courts are all ready though they may not be perfect. But then, nothing is perfect, industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen said at the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry office on Tuesday afternoon.        
	The chamber is organising the 11-day Industrial India Trade Fair at the permanent fairground, on the Park Circus-EM Bypass connector, from December 24.        
	Metro visited Milon Mela in the evening and saw that while the ground itself was in better condition than last year, the other facilities had not improved much. Workers were laying concrete blocks on sand near the main entrance. At a distance, road rollers were trying to level a strip of ground marked road in white.        
	Inside the hangars, electricians worked on fittings. Gardeners were planting trees outside. The administrative building was being painted. Only patches of the five-acre compound were lit.         
	Last year, participants at the Industrial India Trade Fair had criticised the government for the lack of facilities at the fairground. The electrical wiring was found to be temporary and there was inadequate power back-up.        
	Things have been taken care of this year, said Sen on Tuesday.        
	On the strength of refurbished infrastructure, the government has decided to raise the fee it charges from fair organisers. We have decided to raise the fees to take care of the recurring expenses and doesnt account for the capital expenditures, said Sen.        
	Sources in the chamber said they had been asked in mid-November to pay about Rs 22 lakh more than last years fee and had appealed for concession.

	A Madhyamik candidate who landed in hospital after a serious road accident wrote her history paper propped up on a bed in Howrah District Hospital on Monday.        
	In severe pain after undergoing surgery, Madhumita Khanra narrated the answers to a writer under the supervision of two invigilators deputed by the district inspector of schools (DI) and completed the exam on time.        
	The resident of Kultikari in Howrah was returning home on a neighbours motorcycle after writing the life science exam on Saturday when a car belonging to the Howrah Zilla Parishad hit the motorcycle. Madhumitas right leg was lacerated and her left arm was fractured.        
	The officials in the zilla parishad car assured us they would bear the cost of treatment. But they havent come to see her in hospital even once, let alone pay for treatment, said the gritty teenagers father, Gautam Khanra. I am a poor farmer and have already spent Rs 5,000. I cannot afford to bear the cost of further treatment.        
	Madhumita is a student of Borda Gangadharpur High School. Pronab Duari, the assistant head teacher of the school, said: Madhumita is a very sincere and hardworking student. When we came to know she wanted to write the exams despite such a terrible accident, we contacted the DI and he helped us.        
	No FIR was lodged regarding the accident because the zilla parishad officials had assured Madhumitas father that they would take care of the matter.         
	Meena Ghosh Mukherjee, the sabhadipati of Howrah Zilla Parishad, said: I was busy with other work. No one informed me about the incident. I will conduct a probe and arrange to help the girl.

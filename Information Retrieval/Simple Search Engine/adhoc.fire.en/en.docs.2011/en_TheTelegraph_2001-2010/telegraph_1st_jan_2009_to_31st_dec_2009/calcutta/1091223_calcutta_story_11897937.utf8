The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Eden lights hinge on luck
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Eden lights hinge on luck
  - In case of voltage fluctuation, play may pause for 15 minutes          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A power cut or even a minor fluctuation in voltage can plunge Thursdays India-Sri Lanka tie at Eden Gardens into darkness for at least 15 minutes.        
	Some repairs have been done but there is no denying that if there is any disruption in supply, it would take some time before all the lights in the towers are back in full glow, PWD minister Kshiti Goswami told Metro.        
	An engineer involved with the lighting arrangements at Eden  which had suffered a 31-minute blackout during a Kolkata Knight Riders match in April 2008  defined Goswamis some time as 15-20 minutes.        
	The PWD is in charge of the lights in the four towers  each fitted with 216 metal hallide lamps  around the stadium, while CESC supplies power. CAB is responsible for the upkeep of the towers.        
	Forget power cuts. The problem with metal halide lamps is that they cant withstand even the slightest voltage fluctuation. We get power from the national grid and it is impossible to say there wont be any voltage surge during the match, said a CESC official.        
	The utility has arranged for three dedicated feeders for the towers. The feeders could together supply 9MW against the quartets collective demand of 2MW. But thats no guarantee for a glitch-free match. The norm is to maintain supply through two feeders though one is enough for all four towers. If one feeder trips, the third is immediately activated. But even a moments disruption can derail the match as it will take 15-20 minutes to restore the optimum glow of the lamps, an engineer explained.        
	Biswarup Dey, the CAB joint secretary, expressed helplessness, saying the system is rather old and has its limitations. The steering committee on lights, headed by minister Goswami, will meet on Wednesday to review the situation.        
	CAB insiders said the only solution was to install high-powered UPS (uninterruptible power supply) for each tower. The stadium may boast such a system during the 2011 World Cup. We have arranged for 10 sound-proof generators which can keep the stadium lamps burning but not the ones in the towers, said a source.        
	As Team India hits the ground on Thursday, Sachin Tendulkar will sure miss Edens signature crowd. At a programme in town on Tuesday evening, the little master said: We always look forward to play in front of 95,000 to 1,00,000 people (at Edens).        
	The stadium can now seat only around 45,000 people as a section of the gallery has been pulled down for the makeover.

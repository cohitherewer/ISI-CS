The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Parents protest school fee hike
                                                                                                               Parents protest school fee hike
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	More than 200 parents demonstrated outside Sunrise School in Belur, Howrah, from 10am to 5pm on Wednesday to protest a hike in fees.         
	The agitation was withdrawn after the school authorities agreed to consider a rollback within April 27. Around 3,500 girls and boys study in the school, which is affiliated to the ISC board.        
	According to the parents, school fees were recently increased from Rs 600-700 to Rs 1,050-1,190.         
	The agitators said the acting principal, Sunita Srivastava, misbehaved with them when they met her for an explanation. Srivastava denied the allegation. She declined to comment on the hike.        
	The parents allegedly damaged windows of the school building during the demonstration.         
	The district administration sent a deputy magistrate to the school to broker peace between the parents and the authorities. Personnel from Bally police station also rushed to the spot.        
	Manatosh Kumar Singh, the secretary of the parents and guardians association of the school, said: If the authorities do not revert to the old fees, we shall shut down the school and admit our children elsewhere. We shall not accept the fee hike on any condition.        
	Madhumita Singh, whose son Rudranath studies in Class VI, said: The school authorities told us while admitting students into classes two months ago that the fees will not be hiked. The sudden increase has become a burden. Had I known about the hike, I would not have admitted my son in the school.        
	Kanika Ganguli, the MLA from Bally, was allegedly made to wait near the school gate for an hour and a half.        
	Srivastava later met her and the agitators in the CPM party office adjacent to the school.        
	I rushed to the school to broker peace. But school authorities made me wait for more than an hour and a half. The arrogance of the school authorities and the arbitrary decision to hike the fees forced the parents to agitate, said the MLA.

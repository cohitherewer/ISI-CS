The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Plane glass cracks
                                                                                                               Plane glass cracks
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A Druk Air flight carrying 90 passengers had a close shave after the outer layer of its windshield cracked mid-air on Friday morning, prompting the pilot to make an emergency landing in Calcutta.         
	The Airbus 319 was flying from Bangkok to Gaya, from where it was scheduled to leave for Paro, in Bhutan.        
	Airline officials were not sure why the windshield cracked but suspected a sudden difference in air pressure to be the cause.        
	The cracks, six-seven inch long, had spread in various directions from the epicentre, said a city-based spokesperson for Bhutans national carrier.         
	Had the cracks widened and the windshield shattered, the pilots and the passengers could have been dragged out because of the huge difference in air pressure within and outside the aircraft. Besides, the temperature at that altitude  22,000 feet  was less than minus 30 degrees Celsius, the spokesperson added.        
	The airline, however, clarified that chances of the windshield getting shattered were slim as the cracks had developed on the outer layer while the inner layer was intact.         
	The flight was over Dhanbad around 7.50am when the pilot noticed the cracks to the left of the cockpit. Calcutta was 130 nautical miles (22 minutes of flying time) and Gaya 100 nautical miles (15 minutes flying time) from that point.        
	Since Calcutta airport is better equipped for emergency landing and has a better maintenance base than Gaya, the pilot decided to land here, an airport official said.        
	Immediately after spotting cracks, the pilot descended to 10,000 feet and contacted the air traffic control (ATC) of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport.        
	Ambulances and fire tenders were kept ready on the edge of the runway when the flight landed at 8.24 am.        
	A flight from Paro arrived with four engineers later in the day. The stranded passengers left for Paro on that flight at 12.30pm. Officials said the damaged windshield had been replaced and the aircraft would fly back to Paro on Saturday.

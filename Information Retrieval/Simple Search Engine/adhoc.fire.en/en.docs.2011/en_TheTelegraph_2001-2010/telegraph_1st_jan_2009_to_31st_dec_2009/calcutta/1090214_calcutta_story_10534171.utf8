                      Celebration of love                    A day that has become synonymous with partying, boisterous revelry and exchanging of expensive gifts, the real significance of Valentines Day, as a day of celebration of romantic love, is all but forgotten. In the midst of this riotous cacophony propagated by consumerism, we somehow eschew Shakespeare, Keats, Tagore, Baudelaire, Yeats, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, D.L. Roy, Shakti Chattopadhyay and many other poets, whose immortal love lyrics still have the power to captivate the romantic imagination of people of all generations. How do I Love Thee, a tapestry of European and Indian love poetry interlaced with Tagore songs, was envisioned by Sounak Chattopadhyay with the sole purpose of reinterpreting the famous literary works of these great poets. Actors Parambrata Chatterjee and Debleena Dutt will recite, narrate and enact selected portions from Shakespeares Romeo and Juliet, Keats Ode to a Nightingale and Tagores Shesher Kabita, among many others. Timeless Tagore songs like Aami rupey tomay bholabo na and Aami chini go chini tomarey will be presented by Sounak Chattopadhyay and Shreya Guhathakurta. Script: Shankarlal Bhattacharya. Presented by Chinton.                    Event: An evening of Indian and European love poetry and songs When: Today at 6 pm Where: Kala Mandir

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Deadly sticks minus battery
                                                                                                               Deadly sticks minus battery
          A STAFF REPORTER                                                
	The gelatine sticks found in a private bus on Tuesday night were powerful enough to blow up a building spread over 5,000sq ft.         
	The seven sticks, found wrapped in a mosquito net, were fitted with detonators and required only batteries to be activated.        
	After examining the sticks  which resemble candles and weigh 1.4kg  experts said they were more powerful than 500gm of RDX.        
	The consignment was meant for carrying out blasts. Each stick was fitted with a detonator and the wires were connected properly. By adding only a battery, any group could have executed an attack, said S.N. Gupta, the deputy inspector-general (operations) of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID).        
	He added the explosives first reached the city and then were transported to Howrah for delivery somewhere in the neighbouring area.        
	The explosives were spotted by passengers and a conductor of a private bus plying on route 215A when it reached its Howrah terminus from Salt Lake around 9pm. The conductor contacted the office of the bus operators union on the route, took the bus back to its Sector V depot and alerted the police.         
	The investigators found out that the gelatine sticks were manufactured by a private company, Solar Explosive Factory, in Nagpur. We saw Super Power-90 written on the seven pink-coloured sticks. We have written to the factory asking where gelatine sticks of this particular batch were delivered, said a CID officer.        
	Explosives are mainly manufactured in ordnance factories. Sometimes, the defence ministry outsources manufacture of explosives to listed firms. Companies engaged in mining and other work where explosives are used can buy dynamite and gelatine sticks with permission of the controller of explosives. The CID suspects that the gelatine sticks were stolen from one such company.        
	Gupta said the consignment did not reach those who intended to use it. Those who wanted to carry out explosions would not have carried the sticks in a mosquito net, he said.

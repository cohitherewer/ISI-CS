	Two polythene bags stashed with 17 guns, more than 1,600 bullets and material used for making crude bombs were found buried in Thakurdari, in New Town Action Area II, on Sunday afternoon.        
	A 52-year-old man identified as Ajit Naskar, who lived within a stones throw from the spot where the bags were found, has been detained.        
	The haul is worth Rs 20 lakh. Among the arms recovered were single-barrel carbines, improvised pipe guns and an improvised sten gun. There were three packets full of a substance used for making crude bombs. The bullets carry the marks of ordnance factories in Pune and Kanpur, said an officer of New Town police station.        
	North 24-Parganas police superintendent Supratim Sarkar said a tip-off led a team from the police station to Naskars house, barely 150 metres from Balaka housing estate.        
	As the search drew a blank, the cop team went behind the house and started digging loose soil on the banks of a ditch. Two bags were found buried under the soil. One contained the guns and the other the bullets and bomb-making material, said an officer.        
	The cops said Naskar, who claimed to be a farmer, lived in the house with his wife, son and two brothers. None of them could be tracked down. We are looking for two youths, said an officer.         
	The sleuths said several arms and ammunition, carrying the marks of the Pune and Lucknow factories, were seized in Malda on Friday. We are trying to find out whether the two incidents were linked, said an officer. Trinamul Congress MP Kakali Ghosh Dastidar  New Town falls under her Barasat constituency  alleged Naskar was a CPM cadre. Local CPM leaders denied the charge.

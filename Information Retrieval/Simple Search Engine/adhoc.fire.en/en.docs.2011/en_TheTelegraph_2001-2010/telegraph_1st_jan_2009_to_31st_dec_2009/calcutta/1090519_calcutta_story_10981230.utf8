	The civic authorities will meet realtors on Tuesday to alert them against water accumulation at construction sites that could turn breeding ground of mosquitoes.The meeting at the civic headquarters is part of a drive to control vector-borne diseases in Calcutta.        
	The authorities will explain to representatives of Credai, a realtors body, how dengue and malaria spreads because of accumulation of water and warn them that fines might be slapped and stop-work notices issued if preventive measures are not taken, said a civic official.         
	This is the first round of meetings related to the malaria-dengue prevention programme. Similar meetings will be held with representatives of schools, colleges, hospitals and traders. We have drawn up a scheme to involve people in destroying the breeding grounds of mosquitoes, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.

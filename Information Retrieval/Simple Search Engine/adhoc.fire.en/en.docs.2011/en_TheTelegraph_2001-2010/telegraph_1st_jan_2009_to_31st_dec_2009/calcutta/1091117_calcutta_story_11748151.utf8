          OUR BUREAU                                    
	Within 10 days of Mamata Banerjee pitching for the autonomy of Presidency College, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee announced that the college would get the status of an autonomous university.        
	The governing body of Presidency College has given us a proposal to make Presidency College a full-fledged autonomous university. I welcome the proposal, said Bhattacharjee while addressing a Left Front rally on Monday afternoon.        
	This is not the first time Bhattacharjee, an alumnus of the college, has broached the issue of Presidencys autonomy at a public meeting. In February 2006, he had promised a decision within six months and a committee was formed. It took the committee around a year to announce its decision and the 192-year-old institution was denied the right to chart its own course.        
	But a prod from Mamata  the Trinamul leader had wondered why the government was not granting autonomy to Presidency, during The Telegraph-Calcutta Club National Debate on November 7  may have prompted the chief minister to spell out a tentative roadmap for the premier institute.        
	I have spoken to higher education minister Sudarshan Ray Chaudhury regarding Presidencys upgrade. We will now take up the matter in the next Assembly session and announce our final decision, the chief minister added.        
	Conferring full autonomy on Presidency will, however, be easier said than done, as the chief minister will have to face stiff resistance from his comrades. While the governing body of the college has sought unitary university status for the college, the CPM-controlled Association of Government College Teachers has demanded affiliating university status to empower Presidency to offer affiliation to other government colleges.        
	As the chief minister didnt spell out the nature of autonomy  unitary or affiliating  the government is considering, those batting for Presidencys autonomy were in no mood to celebrate.         
	We want unitary university status for the college but for that recruitment of faculty should start afresh, said an alumnus. He also stressed that there was no point burdening Presidency with the load of other colleges as its affiliates.        
	At present, Presidency is an affiliate of Calcutta University and is directly under the control of the state higher education department, which means teaching and non-teaching staff are state government employees.        
	If the college is given unitary university status  after a clearance from the CU syndicate  it will enjoy full academic, administrative and financial freedom. But college employees will no longer remain government employees.        
	The chief minister will face resistance from the syndicate, which has to unanimously clear the proposal. Only a strong resolve can push through autonomy, said a professor of the college.

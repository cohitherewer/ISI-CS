          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Tuesday slammed police for sitting on torture complaints filed by aged people against their children and for not providing adequate security to the complainants.        
	The police should be more attentive in hearing the pleas of the elderly people and should provide adequate protection to them, Justice P.K. Chattopadhyay said while hearing two petitions, both filed by aged individuals.        
	In one of the cases, the judge criticised the Barasat police for not carrying out its order to help Bidhu Bhusan Chowdhury, 76, and his wife Meera, 67, to enter their house in Netaji Pally.         
	The elderly couple were driven out of their home by their third daughter, Basanti.        
	The judge also censured the officer-in-charge of Barasat police station, Paritosh Ghosh, for his failure to produce Basanti in the court on Tuesday.         
	Justice Chattopadhyay had last week asked Ghosh to ensure safe entry of the couple into their house and produce Basanti in the court on Tuesday.        
	But with the police ignoring the directive, neither could Basanti be brought to the court nor could the couple set foot in the Netaji Palli house.        
	The judge on Tuesday passed a fresh order asking the OC to produce Basanti on December 11.        
	The lawyer appearing for the couple had earlier told the court: Basanti has become a terror to the family. She returned to her parents house after her separation from her husband two years ago and has since been torturing the couple. She wants her parents to gift her the house.        
	The lawyer alleged that his clients had lodged several complaints with Barasat police station but the officers did not come to the couples rescue.        
	The other petition was moved by a 68-year-old widow, Lila Sharma.        
	Her lawyer Koyeli Bhattacharya submitted before the court that her clients eldest son Raghunath and two daughters-in-law, Sucharita and Kakoli, had driven her out of her husbands three-storeyed house on Thakur Ramakrishna Road in Shibpur, Howrah.        
	The trio, who have been demanding the ownership of the building, also drove out Lilas two other sons  Chandranath (Kakolis husband) and Priyanath  as they sided with their mother, the lawyer said.        
	The judge directed the Shibpur police to help Lila enter her house and stay there peacefully.        
	The judge also asked the police to produce Raghunath, Sucharita and Kakoli before him on December 11.

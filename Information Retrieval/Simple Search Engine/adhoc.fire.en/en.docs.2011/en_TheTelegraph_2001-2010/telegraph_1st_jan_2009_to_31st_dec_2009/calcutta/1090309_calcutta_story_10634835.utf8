The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Market corners in revamp mode
                                                                                                               Market corners in revamp mode
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                          Reconstruction in progress in the vegetable corner of New Market. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                  
	The civic body has decided to reconstruct the decrepit fish and vegetable corners of New Market on its own after attempts at private-public partnerships fell through.        
	There are over 250 stalls in the two sections  declared condemned in 2000  which comprise around 25 per cent of the market and record an average daily footfall of 50,000.  
	Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay, who had approved the demolition of the unsafe parts in May 2007, has allotted Rs 1 crore for the reconstruction.        
	The renovation will be over by Puja. The daily business of the market will not be affected because of the work, the commissioner said.        
	Deputy chief engineer Jyoti Prakash Sarkar said the revamp of the fish market would cost Rs 30 lakh and the vegetable corner, Rs 70 lakh. The thickness of the iron pillars has reduced from 200mm to 6mm over the past 130 years, said Sarkar.        
	The civic authorities had been planning to decommission the fish and vegetable corners since 2000, when a board with the word Unsafe written on it was hung in the area.        
	In 2007, the authorities even stopped collecting rent from the stall-owners.        
	But neither the board declaring the zone unsafe nor the decision to stop collecting rent could affect the daily business.        
	After the present board came to power in 2005, a technical committee comprising director-general (building) Gora Chand Mondol and director-general (project and development) Nilangshu Bose was formed to ascertain the structural stability of the part of the market housing the fish and vegetable sections. The panel had stated that the part could collapse any moment.        
	The authorities had initially decided to renovate the damaged parts in association with private parties. According to the plan, the stall-owners were to be relocated during the reconstruction and brought back after the sections were ready.        
	But, officials said, the plan fell flat because no suitable plot was found in the area where the traders could be relocated and private firms did not show any interest as they were not allowed to add floors to the heritage structure that could have been commercially exploited.

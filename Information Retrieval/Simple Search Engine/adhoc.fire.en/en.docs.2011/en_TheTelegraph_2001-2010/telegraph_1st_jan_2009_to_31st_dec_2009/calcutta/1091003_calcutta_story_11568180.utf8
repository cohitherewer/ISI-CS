                    Students of Shri Shikshayatan School participate in a programme to raise environmental awareness at Babughat on September 15. Twenty-five students installed waste disposal bins and handed leaflets as part of the school rsquo;s Better Calcutta programme.

	Tips to scale peaks  
	What kind of a routine should I follow if I want to be a mountaineer?, Which are the clubs in my part of the city which teach rock-climbing?, How old do I have to be if I want to go trekking? These were some of the questions that mountaineer Goutam Ghosh was faced with at a talk organised by Oxford Junior Bookstore, along with Himalayan Club, in August.   
	Ghosh, who has 25 expeditions to his credit, spoke about his attempt to scale Mount Everest in April as part of a Nehru Institute of Mountaineering team.         
	We were climbing up to the final camp at 8000m when an avalanche brought down a huge flurry of snow and rocks. It was too sudden for us to take any precaution, recalled Ghosh to his spellbound audience, comprising mostly students. Two of his teammates died in the avalanche, while five, including Ghosh, were injured. He had to turn back because of the injury.        
	During a slideshow on the expedition, he pointed out the various peaks and the route the team had taken. Introducing rock-climbing equipment like the descender, rock piton and jumar to the audience, he also offered tips to the aspiring mountaineers: Joining a club, where you will be taught how to handle equipment, to read maps and to tie knots, is the first step.         
	Rock-climbing improves fitness and staying at a camp with others teaches one to adjust to adverse living conditions, he added.         
	Sumanta Roy of Apeejay School was enthused enough to want to join a club right after his board exams. I would love to have a taste of what I saw pictures of, he said.

	 FUN WITH YOGAS  
	 Muskaan Lohia, a Class II student of Lakshmipat Singhania Academy, loves listening to stories. On September 13, she joined other children of her age to enact some of her favourite folk tales through asanas at the Story with Yoga workshop at Starmarks Lord Sinha Road address.																								   
	Narrated by Mira and Daleep Kakkar of the Kathakars, the first story, How Did The Tiger Get its Stripes, was about the way a clever man outwitted a tiger who wanted to eat his buffalo. I used halasan to denote paddy fields. This requires one to raise ones legs above the head and forward so that the toes touch the ground, explained yoga instructor Prasanna Saiga, who guided the participants.																								   
	Said Mira, who conceptualised the programme: Yoga helps children cope with the pressure of studies and exams. Combining it with stories helps to capture their interest.																								   
	The idea was a success, if Muskaans enthusiasm is anything to go by. I cant wait to go home and practise the asanas again, she said.																								   
	The second story of the day, The Magic Wrap, on the reason behind the peacocks gorgeous feathers, was enacted through dance moves.																								   
	Said Daleep: We hope that this exercise might help children tell their own stories through yogic postures.																								   
	Agreed Anushree Lohia, Muskaans mother: Usually, it is difficult to interest a child in yoga, but introducing it through stories is a novel concept.

	Puja fervour            
	 Delhi Public School, Ruby Park, celebrated Durga puja with a special assembly on September 16 on the school premises. Students from the nursery classes to Class I performed a dance to an agamani song followed by the chanting of slokas. They also performed a dhunuchi naach to the beats of the dhaak. The high point of the day was the students reciting Tagore rsquo;s poem, Pujor Saaj.  
	 Shall we dance?  
	 On September 16, Pailan World School, in association with TTIS, organised an inter-school dance competition, called lsquo;Dance Waves rsquo;. The programme had nine schools as participants, including South City International School, Adamas International and Lakshmipat Singhania Academy, performing eastern and western classical and folk numbers.   
	 The winners were MP Birla Foundation School, Carmel High School and Pailan World School. The event also announced the Abhishek Memorial Scholarship, to be given away to meritorious students in the fields of academics, sports and extra-curricular activities.  
	 New look            
	Apeejay Anand Children rsquo;s Library, an activity centre for the underprivileged children from the slums of Park Street and Mullickbazar, unveiled a new look on September 8 with a stage and puppets on the walls.   
	 Present for the occasion were novelist Amit Chaudhuri and the inspector-general of the south Bengal Border Security Force, C. V. Muralidhar. Chaudhuri highlighted the importance of a library in a student rsquo;s life.   
	 The students, from Apeejay School and the library, presented a skit on the right to education, followed by dance and songs. Class III student Rohan Rahut loves coming to the library every day. ldquo;We not only study, but are also taught to dance and paint here. rdquo;

	THE   DIARY  
	A new dawn
    
	Wanting happiness, 
  I banish the gloom.
  My heart craves peace.
  I lift my hands to the Lord,
  I ask him to take away My burden
  Of remorse and pain.
  Vengeful images cross my mind,
  I lose myself in the past.
  A soft voice whispers,
  I take in the fragrance Of the sweet words;
  All thoughts of grief vanish.
  I wait for a new dawn.

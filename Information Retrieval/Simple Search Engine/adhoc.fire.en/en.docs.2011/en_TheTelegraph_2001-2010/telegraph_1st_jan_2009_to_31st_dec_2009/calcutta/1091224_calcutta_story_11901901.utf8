  - Mercury and moisture dip to season low, colder days ahead          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Calcuttans enjoyed the seasons coolest morning on Wednesday, which the weatherman said was a precursor to an even cooler Christmas.        
	As a cold and windy dawn broke on the citys horizon, the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore recorded a minimum temperature of 13.1 degrees Celsius, a December 23 record in the past decade.         
	An official of the Delhi-based India Meteorological Department (IMD) said: The minimum temperature, one point below normal on Wednesday, may drop further over the next couple of days as the cold, dry northwesterlies are gaining in strength across the Indo-Gangetic plain. On Christmas Eve, the mercury is likely to slide below 12 degrees in the suburbs and on the fringes.        
	The minimum temperature last Christmas was 12.9 degrees Celsius.        
	With the winter setting in a fortnight earlier than usual on November 22 and the mercury dropping gradually till December 10, meteorologists had expected that the 13-degree mark would be breached by December 15.         
	But the sudden formation of Cyclone Ward off the Tamil Nadu coast had dashed hopes, with the city experiencing an unusually warm phase for nine days from December 12.        
	Now that the 13-degree mark has been reached, there are chances that the minimum temperature would plummet to 10 degrees by early next month. We are not certain but the possibility cant be ruled out, the IMD official said.        
	Meteorologists said the dip in the mercury has been primarily brought about by lower humidity, which dropped to 38 per cent on Wednesday.        
	Moisture is not accumulating in the atmosphere as there is no low-pressure formation over the Bay of Bengal. Lower levels of humidity is letting the heat escape from the surface and also clearing the way for the free flow of northwesterlies and western disturbances, said a senior scientist at the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting.        
	The residue of one western disturbance has just passed through eastern India. More are likely to follow over the next week, he added.        
	Western disturbances are cool, moisture-laden winds from the Mediterranean region which, along with the north winds, help lower the temperature across the Indo-Gangetic plain around this time of the year.        
	According to the Alipore Met office, the sky on Thursday is likely to remain mainly clear and the minimum temperature will hover around the 13-degree mark.

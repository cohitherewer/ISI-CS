                      Answering the atavistic call of nature                    Maihar, a small hamlet tucked in the interiors of Madhya Pradesh, is known for the musical legacy of Baba Allauddin Khan. This is a place where history and music mingle in every nook and corner. But the lethargy of this sleepy town is shaken for a couple of weeks annually when eminent contemporary artists choose to descend here in troops to work and interact with each other. Organised by Ambica Beri, whose husband, Sanjeev (owner of limestone quarries in Maihar) has converted his family homestead into a spectacular Italianate villa without changing its basic structure. Consequently theres plenty of room around a spacious green courtyard for the artists. The place throbs with life and vitality every year when artists from all over the country meet and spend a few days in each others company, engaged in the work of creation. Last year, 25 artists were invited to join the camp. Away from the urban crowds, they interacted and worked in the relaxed environs of the old family home. The tranquillity was just perfect for producing a crop of outstanding works. Participating artists included Anjolie Ela Menon, Lalu Prasad Shaw, Sakti Burman, Jaya Ganguly, Rini Dhumal, Partha Shaw, Paresh Maity, among others. The exhibition will feature works produced during the Retreat.

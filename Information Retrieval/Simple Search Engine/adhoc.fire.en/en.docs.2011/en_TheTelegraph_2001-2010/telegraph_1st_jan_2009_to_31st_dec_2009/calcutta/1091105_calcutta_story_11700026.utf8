The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Showcause sham in replacement relay
                                                                            Thursday , November 5 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Showcause sham in replacement relay
          OUR BUREAU                          Owners of over 1,800 banned buses have not applied for replacement on time                                  
	The state government on Wednesday issued showcause notices to over 1,100 bus and minibus operators, out of the 1,800-odd who missed the deadline for filing applications for replacement of phased-out buses.        
	About 1,100 bus and minibus operators are being showcaused for not meeting the deadline. They have 15 days from now to come up with a satisfactory response, transport minister Ranjit Kundu said at Writers Buildings.        
	He added that many operators had been unable to apply for financial or other genuine constraints. The government will consider the cases of those who are facing genuine problems, so that all those willing get a fair chance.        
	On October 7, Kundu had announced that October 31 was the last date for submission of applications. Because October 31 was a Saturday and Monday too was a holiday, the government accepted applications till Tuesday.        
	Of the 3,067 banned vehicles (2,557 buses and 510 minibuses), owners of about 1,200 have applied for replacement so far.         
	What about the 700-odd who missed the deadline but arent being showcaused? Most of them have already abandoned the business, claimed Kundu.        
	The minister reiterated his stand of cancelling permits of those who did not respond satisfactorily to the showcause within 15 days.         
	Operators, however, were sure that the government would backtrack yet again. Theres no need for worry. No matter what the minister says, there will be more extensions. There are no takers for new permits. The government will not risk cancelling existing permits, said a senior leader of the Trinamul-backed transport lobby.        
	Officials in Kundus department echoed the Trinamul leader. Cancellation of permits is unlikely in the current situation unless it becomes an ego issue for the minister. The operators are so confident because they are aware of the ground reality, said a senior official who didnt wish to be named.        
	According to Kundu, the government has received over 23,000 applications for replacement of legal autos and over 6,600 new green autos are already plying in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area (CMA).         
	Over 1,650 new taxis are plying in the city and another 4,800 will hit the road soon, easing the situation for taxi commuters considerably, added the minister.        
	He announced that 39 new LPG stations would be set up in the CMA by March, taking the current tally of 16 to 55.

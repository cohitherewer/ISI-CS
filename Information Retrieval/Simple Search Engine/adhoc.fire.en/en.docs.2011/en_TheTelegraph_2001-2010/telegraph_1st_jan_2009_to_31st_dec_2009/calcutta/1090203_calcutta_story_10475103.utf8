The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Five-year facelift plan for museum milestone
                                                                                                               Five-year facelift plan for museum milestone
  - Tips from Tate shape Rs 70-crore blueprint for restoration of 195-year-old Chowringhee landmark          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI IN NEW DELHI                                                
	Once the citys badge of honour, Indian Museum is set to enter a five-year rehabilitation programme in a bid to reclaim its lost glory by the time it turns 200. The ministry of culture has planned a restoration and upgrade project to revolutionise its security, transform its interiors, and make gallery viewing a pleasure like never before.        
	Privately unveiled to the board of trustees of the museum on January 28, the plan  with tips from Tate, no less  aims to complete the transformation by 2014, in time for the bicentenary of Asias oldest museum of its kind. The plan consists of two components that are together expected to cost around Rs 70 crore.        
	The Chowringhee landmark boasts of Indias largest collection of fossils, skeletons, Mughal paintings and other artefacts including an Egyptian mummy, a Buddhist stupa and four relic caskets. The excavated caskets contain remains of either the Buddha or his disciples. But the museum has been mired in neglect and controversy. A CBI team quizzed officials after a reported scam last year, and the comptroller and auditor general reported financial irregularities worth lakhs. The decaying maintenance standards at the ninth oldest museum in the world have been all too evident.        
	Now, the worst may finally be over. We firmly believe that the museum requires a radical revamp to bring it on a par with the best museums in the world. It houses the finest and most precious of antiquities that the people of India are entitled to see, said Union culture secretary Jawhar Sircar.        
	The plan presented at the meeting, said Sircar, was the most comprehensive and forward-looking vision and proposal for the total modernisation of Indian Museum that the culture ministry had ever received. The plan has been drafted by a team of three architects contracted by the government, who studied some of the worlds top museums in preparing the blueprint for Indian Museum. These include Londons Tate Modern  the UKs national gallery of international modern art.        
	As the museum is a heritage structure, the first task will be to restore its architectural requirements, said museum director K.K. Basa. The second component will focus on the upgrade  of its galleries, other interiors and of the security. The upgrade will see a 45 per cent increase in the usable area available to the museum.        
	Two new parking lots  each with a capacity for 60 cars  will come up off Kyd Street, bordering the museum complex. One will be underground and the other overground.                                      
	The galleries at present are lit by lamps that do not highlight the visual aspect of the artecfacts on display. Ordinary lamps also emit ultra-violet radiation that can damage paintings and other artefacts. Under the revamp plan,         
	 All lamps will be replaced with fibre optic lighting - hair thin fibres embedded into walls or cases that will glow. Fibre optic lighting allows for the frequency of light emitted to be controlled, so Museum managers can both ensire a better visual spectacle, and cut out UV radiation.         
	Light emitting diodes will also be used for lighting, along with the fibres. LEDs also do not emit UV radiation.         
	 quot;We are already negotiating with the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) for its trained personnel to take over the museums security. But the plan will also involve state of the art unmanned security systems, quot; Basa told The Telegraph.         
	Closed circuit televisions will be placed strategically to cover every single possession of the Museum.         
	Sensors attached to all artefacts will immediately alert security officers if the antiquities are touched.         
	Some sections where visitor proximity can damage a painting or artefact, will be guarded by laser beam shields apart from physical grills.         
	Asked about the funding for the project and whether that would comprise a challenge, Sircar said he was sure that the government of India quot;at the highest level, would find ways and means to fund the project over the next few years. quot;

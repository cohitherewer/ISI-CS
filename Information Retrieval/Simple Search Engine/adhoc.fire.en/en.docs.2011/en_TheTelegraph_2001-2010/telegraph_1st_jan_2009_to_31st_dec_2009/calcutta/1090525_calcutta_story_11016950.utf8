The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Little bravehearts armed with books amp; a never-say-die spirit
                                                                                                               Little bravehearts armed with books amp; a never-say-die spirit
          CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE AND MALINI BANERJEE                                                  
	Zubin Sheth stands two feet tall at his desk in class to take notes because he cannot sit properly. But that hasnt stopped the 16-year-old from scoring 93.25 per cent in ICSE 2009.        
	The student of Bhawanipur Gujarati Education Society school was born with multiple joint problems, which stunted his growth and restricted his movement.        
	But his disability, which he dismisses with a small shrug, did not stop him from scoring big in ICSE.        
	I have a little difficulty in walking but it is nothing, said Zubin, who according to headmaster Brijbhushan Singh has to be carried up and down the stairs and can barely shuffle around on his own.        
	I am proud of Zubin. He is a popular boy, full of life and has a large group of very good friends and despite all odds has managed to score such high marks, said Singh.        
	The boy who likes playing Counter Strike and Warcraft on the computer, listening to Bollywood music and reading Chetan Bhagat, has decided to study science in Class XI-XII and then venture into some relatively new field of study.        
	I want to study nano-technology; if not, then software engineering, said Zubin.        
	Joining Zubin in his fight to overcome odds to achieve his dreams is 18-year-old Mohit Mehta who was born with cerebral palsy and has managed 77 per cent in his ISC exam despite having to use a writer.        
	I had a younger student of my school, approved by the council, writing for me because I have a writing problem, said the student of St Josephs College in Bowbazar, who was adamant about studying in a normal school.        
	Mohit, who has a perception problem, cannot do geometry and had to stick to certain sections in math, which dragged his score and his overall percentage down.        
	Explaining formulas and instructing my writer was very time consuming as well and that became a problem, said the boy, who loves listening to music and roaming in shopping malls.        
	Mohits argumentative skills have convinced him and his relatives that he should study law. He hopes to get through to the National University of Juridical Sciences.        
	I am differently-abled and get some benefits but people like me have to fight for their right to inclusive education. Not everyone gets a St Josephs or a principal like N. McNamara. I want to fight for their rights, said Mohit, smiling confidently.        
	Another braveheart who can afford to smile for a while is Frank Anthony Public School student Swati Bhura who has had to take up the role of the man of the house very early in life.        
	The fun-loving girl fights a rare battle to educate herself. Her father lost his job some seven years ago and took up petty jobs while her mother took to sewing clothes.        
	There was a time when I had to walk from Liluah to Belur to save money on way to school but I did not give up and managed 90 per cent in ICSE, said Swati.        
	The Telegraph School Award winner did one better last week by scoring 94.5 percent in her ISC. This despite life delivering its biggest blow just before her exams  the death of her mother, who was Swatis strength.        
	I could not study at all the whole of February. My sister and I were left alone because our father had moved to Bihar for work, said Swati, who wants to study commerce in St Xaviers College, but does not know if she can pay the fees.        
	But the girl who believes that she inherited her fighting spirit from her mother is not ready to give up.        
	It will be more difficult now that my sister and I are all alone and have to look after each other. Paying for college will be difficult but I will manage somehow. I wont settle for anything less than the best, said Swati.

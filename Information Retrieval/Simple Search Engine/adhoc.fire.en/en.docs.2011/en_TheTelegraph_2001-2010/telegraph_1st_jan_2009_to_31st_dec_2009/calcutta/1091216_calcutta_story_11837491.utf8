The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rs 1.5crore civic bill for milk booth ads
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rs 1.5crore civic bill for milk booth ads
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has asked Mother Dairy to pay Rs 1.56 crore as civic charges for using 125 milk booths in the city for displaying advertisements.         
	On December 9, we wrote to Mother Dairys Calcutta branch for clearing our dues. We also sent a copy of the letter to Allahabad Bank and BSNL as their billboards have been erected on the milk booths without paying the relevant charges to the CMC, said Saumen Maulik, the chief manager (advertisements) of the CMC.         
	Mother Diary has been given 15 days to pay up, failing which the billboards will be pulled down, Maulik added.        
	Businesses spend a lot of money to promote their products I dont know why they become close-fisted when it comes to paying fees to the corporation, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.        
	Most of the milk booths in the city are pucca structures built on CMC land. Recently advertising agencies started using the counters and roofs for displaying advertisements.         
	Glow signs advertising the products of a telecom major (BSNL) have been put up on booth counters and the roofs are being used for publicising a nationalised bank (Allahabad Bank), said mayoral council member Faiyaz Ahmed Khan.         
	According to the CMC Act, 1980, the agency has to pay tax and rent for using the land and the booth premises for commercial purposes, said Maulik.        
	A spokesperson for Allahabad Bank said the bank had paid its dues to the advertising agency. There are numerous such agencies operating in the city, she said.         
	BSNL officials could not be contacted and a zonal executive of Mother Dairys Calcutta branch refused to comment on the matter.         
	Non-permanent kiosks of the erstwhile Haringhata milk booth have also caught advertisers eye. Last month, the state milk commissioner sought the CMCs permission to allow advertising agencies to renovate 121 Haringhata kiosks in the city and use the street cubicles for ads.        
	The civic roads department, however, has objected to the proposal.         
	The wooden structures would be made permanent in the name of renovation, which is not in the interest of the city, said a source in the civic body.         
	Moreover, it would cause inconvenience to the pedestrians, he added.

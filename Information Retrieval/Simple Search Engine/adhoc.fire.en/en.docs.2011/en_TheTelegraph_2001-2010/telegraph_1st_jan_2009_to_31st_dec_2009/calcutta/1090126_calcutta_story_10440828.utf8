                A fire broke out after an explosion in the godown of an illegal fireworks factory on Gopal Lal Thakur Road in Baranagar on Sunday morning, killing 40-year-old worker Badal Dey. Cracks appeared in the three-storey building following the explosion. Dipak Das and Gopal Das, the owners of the factory, were arrested. Dey, a resident of Tobin Road, died of burns at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. Four fire tenders brought the blaze under control in two hours.    A 47-year-old man was shot dead in front of his residence at Leningar in New Barrackpore by two unidentified criminals on Sunday evening.    Ramchandra Pandit, 67, and Sahadeb Pandit, 35, who were arrested on Saturday for illegally confining Mahadeb Pandit, 47, were granted bail by the chief judicial magistrate, Howrah, on Sunday. Neighbours had complained that the two had kept Mahadeb confined for 18 years.     The 175th anniversary of Medical College and Hospital will be celebrated at Rabindra Sadan and the campus over four days, starting January 28.

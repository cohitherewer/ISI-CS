The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | HC push for pandal rules
                                                                                                               HC push for pandal rules
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                                            
	The high court on Thursday junked the fire departments permission to a Kasba puja and asked the government to frame a fresh guideline for road-hog pandals by September 15.        
	The new guideline, Justice Sanjib Banerjee pointed out, should factor in inputs from all agencies concerned, such as the fire department, police, civic authorities and CESC.        
	The judge, after cancelling the permission to Kasba RK Chatterjee Road Adhibasi Brinda Durgotsab Committee, asked the director-general of the fire services to inspect the pandal thoroughly and decide afresh whether the puja could be allowed.        
	The court glare and a sustained campaign by Metro against road-hog pandals jolted cops out of their slumber, with officers from Maniktala police station forcing 14 Palli Sadharan Durgotsab in Maniktala to leave 4 feet free.        
	The pandal, as reported in Metro on September 9, blocked an arm of Maniktala Main Road next to the Bagmari flyover. We inspected the pandal on the basis of the report and asked the organisers to leave 6 feet open, said an officer of the police station. We are carrying out the order, Ajoy Ghosh, a puja committee member, said on Thursday night.        
	Justice Banerjees order followed a report by special officer Rishav Medora that the Kasba organisers had not left 4 feet of the road free, as mandated by the fire department (the original requirement of 6 feet was modified).        
	Medora told the court on Wednesday that the gap between the pandal and the nearest house on one side of the road  that of petitioner Ishita Chakraborty, who had dragged the puja organisers to court for alleged violation of rules  was about 3 feet. The gap with the nearest house on the other side was just 6 inches.        
	A day before Medoras submission, the fire department had informed the judge that the Kasba puja had abided by its norm of leaving 4 feet space.        
	Fire services director-general Gopal Bhattacharya, present in the court along with advocate-general Balai Ray, was silent when the judge asked what had prompted his department to give the go-ahead to the Kasba puja though it was violating its norms.        
	Earlier, Bhattacharyas lawyer said: My client was asked by the court to inquire whether 4 feet had been spared beside the petitioners house. The fire service did not consider the other side of the pandal as there was no complaint from the other residents.        
	The judge shot back: That does not mean the government will not look into the matter....        
	The judge then said: Durga puja is a national festival and should be performed smoothly. We have to consider the public sentiment... but at the same time the government will have to ensure safety, security and right to free movement of the common people.... Permission should be granted only after ensuring that the organisers are abiding by all norms.        
	The need for a fresh guideline has been highlighted by the case of the Kasba puja, with loopholes in norms and permissions.         
	Thursdays court ruling was followed by a meeting of all deputy commissioners of police to discuss ways to ensure that pandals do not flout the road rules.        
	We have made it clear to all organisers that they cannot erect pandals in violation of the court order. We will keep a close eye on all pandals, said joint commissioner (headquarters) Jawed Shamim.

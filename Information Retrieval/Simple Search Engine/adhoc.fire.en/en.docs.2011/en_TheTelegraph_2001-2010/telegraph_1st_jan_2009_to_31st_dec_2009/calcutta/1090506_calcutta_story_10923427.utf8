                      Revolt against tradition                    Traditional family values and ideals compose the very fabric of Indian society. Unfortunately, various ruthless implications often stay hidden behind the veil of tradition. Balwant Gargis play Lohakut exposes the way it is used as a tool of oppression against women, specially in our villages. The focal point of the play is the mutual tension of love in a conservative family. Dealing with the high-handedness of society on the basis of gender, it launches a direct attack against orthodoxy and thus raises a basic question for society to answer. Its plot revolves around Santi, a woman who summons up the courage to seek a new life with her lover, despite having been married for 18 years. Though completely moulded in the Indian tradition, she is seen to be a victim of social mores and conventions, which she refuses to accept from her heart even though she has been forced to lead life by its rules. Providing an edge to this almost-revolutionary concept of womens liberation in rural India is the fact that she is influenced by her teenaged daughter, who elopes with her lover on the eve of the conventional marriage arranged for her by her father. Design and direction: S.M. Azhar Alam.                  Event: Play in Hindi, Lohakut, produced by Little Thespian When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Sisir Mancha

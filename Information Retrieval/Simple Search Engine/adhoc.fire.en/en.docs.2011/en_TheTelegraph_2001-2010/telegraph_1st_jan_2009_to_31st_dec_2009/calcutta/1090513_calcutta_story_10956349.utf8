The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Jawans held for molest
                                                                                                               Jawans held for molest
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Sanjeev Kumar, a BSF constable who had allegedly molested a woman in her mid-20s near New Market on Monday evening, has been arrested under the BSF Act.        
	Constable Vimal Pratap, who was with Kumar, was also arrested for not preventing his colleague from targeting the woman.        
	The constables were also suspended, Vikash Chandra, the deputy inspector-general of the South Bengal unit of the BSF, stated in a release issued on Tuesday.        
	The constables had come to the city on election duty. They, along with two other colleagues, had parked their duty jeep along the southern pavement of Lindsay Street, facing the Jawaharlal Nehru Road.        
	When the woman was walking past the vehicle, Kumar allegedly opened the door and molested her. After she raised an alarm, the BSF men tried to speed off but were stopped by pedestrians and taken to New Market police station around 5.30pm.        
	Kumar apologised to the woman and requested her to withdraw the complaint she had lodged against him but she did not relent.         
	The accused, however, were not arrested and allowed to leave around 9pm.        
	Chandra denied that the BSF men had requested the woman to withdraw the complaints. Even if the woman does not pursue the case, the legal proceedings against the constables will continue and they will face disciplinary action if proved guilty, the release stated.

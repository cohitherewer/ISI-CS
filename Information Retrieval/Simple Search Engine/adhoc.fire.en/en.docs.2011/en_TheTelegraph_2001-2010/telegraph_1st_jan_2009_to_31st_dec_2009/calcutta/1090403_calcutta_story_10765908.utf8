The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | War of words at film school
                                                                                                               War of words at film school
          A STAFF REPORTER                                          
	Agitating students of the Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute said they felt cheated and abandoned by the authorities as the campus was formally shut down till further notice on Thursday.         
	The students took exception to institute director Swapan Mullicks statement to Metro on Wednesday that the agitation was over non-issues. They said they had no option but to gherao Mullick along with the dean and the administrative and purchase officers for nearly 24 hours from Tuesday afternoon.        
	Our demand for a proper academic schedule, fewer projects in specialisation years, more workshops and practical lessons, transparent admission process and funds for equipment cannot be dismissed as non-issues, said a student.         
	The cinematography department desperately needs competent teachers. The head of the direction department is as good as non-existent. Our learning has been hampered and the authorities are trying to bury the problems, said another student.        
	According to students, the authorities refusal to accept responsibility for problems at the institute and come up with solutions sparked the gherao. Protesters said contrary to Mullicks claim, they had approached him with their problems several times.        
	Weve issued a suspension notice till normality is restored on the campus. Now we have to decide what well do with the students who confined senior officials in the directors room and ransacked it. They have to be more specific about their demands, said Swapan Mullick, the director of institute.        
	Film-maker Buddhadeb Dasgupta, the chairman of the institute, said in Hyderabad: I need to know everything first and I can do that once I reach Calcutta.         
	Students faxed a letter on Thursday to a senior official in the I amp;B ministry stating their demands.

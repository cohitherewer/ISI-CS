The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Gherao for Puja, promotion
                                                                                                               Gherao for Puja, promotion
  - JU students keep officials confined for 24 hours          A STAFF REPORTER                          Students put up posters at Jadavpur University during the gherao. (Anindya Shankar Ray)                                        
	Jadavpur Universitys engineering students on Thursday held their vice-chancellor and other senior teachers hostage and the campus to ransom demanding longer Puja vacation and the promotion of five failed students.        
	Students under the banner of the Federation of Engineering and Technology Students Union (Fetsu) kept several members of the executive council (EC) confined in a room for 24 hours, pressing for a 28-day Puja break, special treatment for five students who had failed in sessional papers, free bus service between the Jadavpur and Salt Lake campuses and more transparency in the evaluation of sessional papers.        
	Some members were let out by Thursday noon but vice-chancellor Pradip Narayan Ghosh, who suffers from hypertension, pro vice-chancellor Siddhartha Dutta and registrar Pradip Kumar Ghosh could walk free only at 6pm.        
	Most members being 55 years and older, the long gherao took a toll on their health. None of us had to be taken to hospital but we were feeling unwell, the vice-chancellor said.        
	Fetsu leaders, however, denied that the VC and other senior officials had been forcibly confined. They were free to leave but had to step over us, said Biswajit Mondol, the general secretary of the organisation.

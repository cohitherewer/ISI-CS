                      Celebration through art                    As part of its 42nd anniversary celebrations, Birla Academy of Art and Culture hosts its annual exhibition of art and sculpture, featuring 1300 artists from all over India. Comprising recent creations, the show reflects the hopes and aspirations, the life and time and the resolve and resurrection of its participants. An interesting aspect of this exhibition is that while leading names of the art world appear to shake off their customary, trademark mannerisms, a number of budding artists are found trying to introduce innovative ideas into their works, adopting new technological advancements. What has resulted is an extraordinary merging of conventional and modern styles, bringing to the fore key creative impulses of both earlier and contemporary generations of artists in our country. Charged with excellent aesthetic potential, it has the power to arrest the attention of all art lovers. Participants include Amlan Dutta, Ganesh Haloi, Satish Gujral, Shuvaprasanna, Sanat Kar, Sujit Kumar Karan, Bimal Kundu, Shipra Bhattacharya, Partha Pratim Das, Sunil Das (a painting by him appears here), Niranjan Pradhan, Debabrata Chakraborty, RM Palaniappan, Robin Mondal and Sanjay Sengupta.

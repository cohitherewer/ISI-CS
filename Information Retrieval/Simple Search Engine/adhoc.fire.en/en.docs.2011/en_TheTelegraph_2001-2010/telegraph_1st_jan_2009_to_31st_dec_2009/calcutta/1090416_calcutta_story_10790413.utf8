The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Campus-trade drive to boost job skills
                                                                                                               Campus-trade drive to boost job skills

	Educational institutes and industry are joining hands to enhance the soft skills of engineering graduates who have been hit hard by the downturn and the freeze on recruitment.        
	As part of the drive, the Confederation of Indian Industry has tied up with the West Bengal University of Technology and the Bengal Engineering and Science University to upgrade the skills of the students.        
	Technical knowledge is not enough to make students employable. Soft skills are equally important. The issue needs to addressed by the institutes, said Saugata Mukherjee, the regional director (eastern region) of the CII.        
	The trade body has formed a consortium which, along with the universities, has drawn up a skill manual that will be part of the curricula.        
	The manual will address the problems faced by students in expressing themselves in English and also other issues, such as body language and etiquette. We hope to introduce the course from the next academic session, said Mukherjee.        
	The universities will shortlist teachers who will be trained in soft skills and act as resource persons on campus. Members of the industry consortium will visit the institutes as guest trainers.        
	To add to the skills of the engineering graduates, Aptech Computer Education has introduced Aptech for Engineers, a series of specialised IT courses for engineering students, from this month.        
	India has a large number of engineering graduates but not everyone has the right training or skills for landing a good job. The course aims to transform engineering students into industry-ready professionals, said Anuj Kacker, the global head of Aptech Computer Education.        
	The courses have been designed to suit the requirements of students undergoing B.Tech, BE or other engineering degree or diploma course.        
	The Globsyn Group that runs a finishing school has also been trying to bridge the gap between the demand for and supply of industry-ready professionals. The Globsyn Knowledge Finishing School System has helped students acquire essential work-skills, said Romit Dasgupta, the director of the Globsyn Group.

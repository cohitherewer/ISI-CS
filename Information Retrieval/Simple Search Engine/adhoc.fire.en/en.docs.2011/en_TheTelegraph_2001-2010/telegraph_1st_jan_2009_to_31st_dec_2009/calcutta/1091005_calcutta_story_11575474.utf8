                About 800 shanties on the banks of the Eastern Drainage Channel in Salt Lakes EE block were razed by Bidhannagar Municipality and the state urban development department on Sunday. A huge police contingent kept vigil as payloaders and bulldozers demolished the shanties and a dais constructed by a human rights organisation to protest the operation. Five persons were detained for resisting the cops.    The body of a woman in her mid-20s was found in the septic tank of a house in Gouranganagar, New Town, on Sunday afternoon. Residents of the area alerted police after a foul smell started emanating from the tank. The body was sent for post-mortem.    A 40-year-old man was arrested in Sonarpur on Sunday after the woman he was living with accused him of raping her 10-year-old daughter. The woman lodged a police complaint on Saturday saying Bimal Swarnakar raped her child on Friday while she was visiting her parents house.    The airport authorities had a tough time on Sunday afternoon trying to persuade a 25-year-old Nigerian woman to leave the airport after they failed to make her board a 4.25pm JetLite flight to Mumbai with her 35-year-old husband, an NRI. The couple went through the security check and obtained boarding passes before the woman refused to get on the plane. The JetLite flight waited for 30 minutes as her husband, along with airport officials and CISF personnel, tried to persuade her. After the flight left at 4.55pm, the woman refused to leave the airport. It took her husband and airport officials another three-and-a-half hours to finally convince her to leave the premises.    Ekadoshi Naskar, a 60-year-old vegetable seller, was injured on Sunday after some bricks from a building under construction in Beniapukur fell on her. She was taken to National Medical College and Hospital. Police said the bricks fell from the hands of a labourer. Some labourers were detained for questioning.

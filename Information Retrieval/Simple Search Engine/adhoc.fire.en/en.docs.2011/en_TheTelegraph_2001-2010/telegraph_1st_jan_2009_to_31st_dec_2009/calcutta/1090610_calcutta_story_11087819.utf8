          A STAFF REPORTER                          Basudeb Bag. (Gopal Senapati)                                  
	Chief secretary Ashok Mohan Chakrabarti would decide whether action would be taken against Basudeb Bag, a deputy inspector-general of police accused of assaulting his eight-year-old domestic help.        
	Inspector-general (organisation) Suman Bala Sahu has met the girl in a Liluah home and filed a report.        
	The chief secretary will go through the report and take a decision.... An FIR has been lodged and a probe is on but it is for the magistrate to decide whether the officer is guilty or not  home secretary Ardhendu Sen said on Tuesday. Asked whether Bag would be suspended, Sen said: You will get to know soon.        
	The state human rights commission has asked the home department to send a report as Bag stands accused of employing child labour and physical torture. The help, a resident of Jhargram, worked in Bags house in Howrahs Sankrail for two years. On June 6 morning, neighbours saw her crying on the road. She told them Bag had assaulted her up for getting up late.

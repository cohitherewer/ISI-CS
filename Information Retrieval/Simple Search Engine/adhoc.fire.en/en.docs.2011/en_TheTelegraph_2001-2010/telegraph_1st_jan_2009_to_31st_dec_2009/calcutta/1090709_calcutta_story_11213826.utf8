The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Train to Lalgarh
                                                                                                               Train to Lalgarh
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Police have received information that 150-200 members of the Krishi Mazdoor Union are planning to assemble at Howrah station on Thursday morning to take the Ispat Express to Midnapore and then head for Lalgarh. The cops said the union was a frontal unit of the banned CPI (Maoists).         
	Senior railway officials and RPF officers went into a huddle on Wednesday evening and decided that the union members would be stopped from boarding the train.         
	The members would be requested not to go ahead since Section 144 has been clamped in and around Lalgarh, said a GRP officer. We will try to persuade them not to take the train. If that doesnt work, we will be forced to make preventive arrests.        
	The train is scheduled to leave at 6.50am and all senior officers from the Howrah district police and the GRP have been asked to be prepared for any eventuality.

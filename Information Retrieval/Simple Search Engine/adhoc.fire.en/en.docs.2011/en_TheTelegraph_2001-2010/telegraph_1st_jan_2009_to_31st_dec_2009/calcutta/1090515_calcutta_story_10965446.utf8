The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Row over unused ballots
                                                                                                               Row over unused ballots
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two trunks containing unused postal ballots were found in a corridor of the old collectorate building in Howrah on Thursday, sparking trouble.        
	Leaders and supporters of the Congress and the Trinamul Congress arrived at the building around noon and asked additional district magistrate (development) Upendranath Sarkar why the sealed trunks were not in the strong room.        
	Dissatisfied with his explanation that the ballots were unused, the Trinamul men allegedly gheraoed Sarkar and came to blows with police.         
	Trinamuls Howrah candidate Ambica Bandopadhyay said: Some members of the co-ordination committee had planned to stamp the unused ballot papers in favour the CPM. We stopped them after some people informed us.        
	Later, the Trinamul supporters held a demonstration in the buildings parking lot, prompting district magistrate Sanghamitra Ghosh to order their arrest. When Asim Ghosh, the Howrah inspector-in-charge, caught hold of a Trinamul supporter, the others snatched him free. They also allegedly assaulted Ghosh.        
	Howrah police chief Niraj Kumar Singh said: We have started two cases. Trinamul supporters gheraoed the additional district magistrate and assaulted the inspector-in-charge of Howrah police station. We are trying to identify the troublemakers. The DM said there was no question of the ballots being misused.

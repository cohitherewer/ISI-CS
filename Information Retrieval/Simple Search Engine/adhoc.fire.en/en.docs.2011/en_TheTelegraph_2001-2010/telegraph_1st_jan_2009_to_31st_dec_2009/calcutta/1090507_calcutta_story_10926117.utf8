                                                                                                               Library link for medical files
          CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE                          The National Library of India (top) and the National Library of Scotland                                  
	Medical records dating back to the Raj will soon be accessible to researchers across India.        
	National Library is in the process of tying up with the National Library of Scotland to exchange medical records.        
	We are working towards a collaborative venture under which National Library will be able to get documents in the possession of the National Library of Scotland and vice-versa, said K. K. Banerjee, the director of the Alipore institution.         
	The process was initiated during Calcutta Book Fair, held in January, where Scotland was the focal theme.        
	One of the delegates, Martin Wade, the director of the National Library of Scotland, spoke about the medical records stored in the Scottish library. The director of the National Library of India also spoke about the medical records here. Both felt this could be the starting point of a link between the two institutions, said Sujata Sen, the director of British Council (East India).        
	Millions of medical records kept in both libraries have already been digitised.        
	Some of the document have been digitised and others will be digitised under the digitisation programme undertaken by the National Library. We will share the documents after digitisation, said Banerjee.        
	The documents will be part of the digital archive of the National Library and can be accessed by anyone in India.        
	National Library already has tie-ups with over 215 institutes in 76 countries. It obtains publications from the partner institutes through gift and book exchange programmes and organises visits of experts to various countries on a reciprocal basis.        
	The National Library of Scotland has a number of medical records of India from the colonial period, which we will be able to access after the tie-up, Banerjee pointed out.        
	The Scottish library has documents related to Nobel laureate Ronald Rosss work in India as well as the work on Kala Azar medicine by Upendranath Brahmachari.        
	The tie-up comes at a good time; this year Calcutta Medical College and Hospital turns 175. The initiative will make research easier for many scholars in India, said Banerjee.        
	Once the Union government ratifies the collaboration, the institutions will sign a memorandum of understanding.

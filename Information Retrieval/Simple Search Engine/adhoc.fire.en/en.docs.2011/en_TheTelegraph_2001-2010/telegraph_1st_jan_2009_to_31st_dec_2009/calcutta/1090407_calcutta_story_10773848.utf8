	Teachers of Maheshtala College wont have to stay away from work if their maids do not turn up and there is no one else to look after their children at home.        
	The college is set to become the first undergraduate institution in the city with a day care centre for the children of its teachers and other employees. Students with children, too, can avail themselves of the centres benefit.        
	The college authorities have prepared a proposal for the day care centre and will place it before a visiting UGC team in a day or two.        
	More than half our teachers are young women with children. A section of them fails to come to the college whenever their maids stay away and there is no one else at home to look after their children. We want to solve the problem by setting up the day care centre where the teachers and other employees can keep their children during working hours, said principal Soumendu Sengupta.        
	All the women teachers in the college, he added, are aged between 28 and 36 years. Male teachers and students, too, can take the benefit of the centre.        
	According to a source in Calcutta University, no other college in the city now runs a day care centre.        
	The college authorities will place the proposal before a UGC team that will hold talks with representatives of various colleges in the state from April 7 to 9 on ways to upgrade the institutions under the 11th Plan.        
	The UGC has offered funds for upgrade under 15 categories, opening a day care centre being one of them.        
	Of the 400-odd colleges in the state, around 100 submitted their proposals to the UGC in the first round of talks held last month.        
	We have not yet come across any proposal to set up a day care centre, said a government official. A number of institutions face the same problem as Maheshtala College. But most, especially those in Calcutta, cannot set up day care centres for want of space.        
	According to UGC guidelines, a day care centre should be located away from staircase, toilets, lifts and traffic and should spread across at least 800sq ft.         
	The central watchdog has agreed to provide a one-time grant of Rs 2 lakh to a college for opening a day care centre.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CBI probe into museum funds fraud
                                                                                                               CBI probe into museum funds fraud

	The CBI is investigating the alleged misappropriation of Rs 50 lakh meant for the renovation of Gurusaday Museum in Thakurpukur.         
	According to investigators, employees of the museum, which showcases folk and tribal art, misappropriated a central grant in 2007-2008.         
	The scam came to light a few months ago. Our team raided the museum a fortnight ago and seized some documents. There is no record of the materials used in the renovation and restoration project, for which the Centre had allotted money, said a CBI official.         
	We found discrepancies in the bills submitted by employees. The audit report is also under scan, he added.        
	The investigators also claimed that contracts were awarded without floating tenders and some of the agencies that bagged orders existed only on paper.         
	The CBI suspects that a section of employees also misused funds during construction of the new gallery of the museum and its annexe.        
	Most of the bills we went through are fake. The amounts mentioned are far higher than the actual price of the items, said an official.         
	Asis Kumar Chakrabarti, the executive secretary and administrative head of the museum, urged the CBI to uncover corruption in the museum, if any.         
	Some officials had visited the museum and asked for expenditure documents. I do not know what they were investigating and they did not say anything, said Chakrabarti.         
	The museum received Rs 41.25 lakh last year, as the first instalment of a central grant for the renovation project, Chakrabarti added.        
	Gurusaday Museum was inaugurated by former chief minister Bidhan Chandra Ray and thrown open to the public in 1963.         
	In 1984, the management of the museum was transferred from Bengal Bratachari Society to Gurusaday Dutt Folk Art Society, which has undertaken the renovation project with funds from the central ministry of textile.        
	Following an agreement between the Centre and the Bengal Bratachari Society, it had been decided that the ministry would provide funds for the upkeep of the museum.         
	The CBI recently filed a chargesheet for the alleged misappropriation of Rs 18 crore by a section of employees of Indian Museum on JL Nehru Road.

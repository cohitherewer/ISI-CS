The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tech scan on heart patients
                                                                                                               Tech scan on heart patients
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Pramod Sachdeva, a 62-year-old trader from Varanasi, suffered a heart attack 10 years ago and has since been on medication. Last November, he suffered a second heart attack and became confined to a wheelchair.        
	Doctors said he would need angioplasty, recounted his daughter Puja. Sachdeva, however, could return to normal life without surgery, thanks to a small device implanted below his left collar bone at Apollo Gleneagles Hospital, Calcutta.        
	The device, a new-generation wireless intracardiac cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), monitors Sachdevas heartbeat and in case of abnormalities, administers corrective electrical shocks.        
	The monitoring can be done over great distances once networking permission from the Indian government comes through. The system is functional in the US. We have applied for permission here, said an official of Medtronic Inc, the US-based company that manufactured the device.        
	In the city, doctors can currently monitor a patients condition and programme ICDs within a radius of 100 metres.         
	Sachdeva now works five hours a day and even though he is not in the hospital, the ICD monitors the condition of his heart and stores the data, said Rabin Chakraborty, an electro-physiologist and the head of the cardiology department at Apollo Gleneagles. He implanted Sachdevas ICD.         
	According to cardiologists, about 20 per cent deaths across the world are caused by sudden cardiac arrests, which can be prevented by ICD.        
	Latest models of ICD can monitor fluid accumulation in lungs. Those suffering from the problem are prone to heart failure. Advanced ICDs can pick up signals three weeks before heart failure due to fluid accumulation in lungs and help in taking preventive measures.        
	The price of the device, about Rs 8 lakh, is a deterrent. The ICD must become cheaper so that common people can benefit from it, said Subha Dutta, an interventional cardiologist at BM Birla Heart Research Centre.

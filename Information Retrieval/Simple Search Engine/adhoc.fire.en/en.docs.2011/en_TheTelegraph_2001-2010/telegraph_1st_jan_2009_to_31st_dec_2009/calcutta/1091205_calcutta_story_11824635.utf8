  - Lantern-making workshop and procession to mark feast day of German saint          ADITI RAY                                Students during the lantern procession outside Max Mueller Bhavan on November 25. Picture by Anindya Shankar Ray                
	For Akanksha Surana, November 25 was a special day. The 11-year-old couldnt wait to celebrate Martinstag at Max Mueller Bhavan.         
	Martinstag, or St Martins Day ,is the feast day for the saint who started out as a Roman soldier and is celebrated in Europe on November 11. According to legend, he once cut his cloak in half to share it with a beggar during a snowstorm, to save him from dying of cold.        
	As part of the celebrations, students from Max Muellers four partner schools, including Modern High School, Birla High School for Boys, Don Bosco Park Circus and The Heritage, made paper lanterns and participated in a procession down Rowland Street, much the same way as the occasion is celebrated in Germany.         
	Students from classes VI to VIII participated in the lantern-making workshop. Equipped with coloured paper, glitter and glue, they cut out Christmas trees, stars, crescent moons and scary faces and pasted them onto surfaces to form the sides of the cubical lanterns that they held suspended from a stick during the procession.         
	I will gift my lantern to my mother, smiled Akanksha, lighting the candle in hers.         
	Students lit up the dark street as they walked holding the brightly-coloured lanterns singing popular German ditties on St Martin that that they had practised during the workshop.         
	Aniket Paul, a student of Birla High, who was struggling with his lantern, was understandably more upbeat about joining in with his friends in the singing. Ich geh mit meiner Lanterne (I am going with my lantern) is my favourite, said the Class VII student who takes German as a third language.        
	Said Sutapa Saho, mother of Class VI participant Nirmalee Saho of GD Birla Centre for Education: Celebrating such festivals brings youngsters in touch with other cultures that they know little of. I would like my daughter to go abroad for higher studies. Such festivals will help her understand foreign cultures better, said Saho.

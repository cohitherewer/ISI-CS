The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Grin amp; grumble over test scrap 
                                                                                                               Grin amp; grumble over test scrap 
          CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE AMP; JHINUK MAJUMDAR                          stress factor: Kapil Sibal                                   
	Most students and parents have welcomed the Centres proposal to make the Class X board exams optional but a section of teachers and school heads is apprehensive about the implications.        
	Union human resource development minister Kapil Sibal had last week unveiled a 100-day agenda, part of which is the proposal on the Class X exam aimed at reducing stress on students.        
	According to Sibals plan, students who wish to apply for Class XI in a school different from where they complete Class X have to sit for the board test. But those who are to stay on in the same school after Class X need not take it.        
	I will be very happy if the proposal is implemented. Board exam means stress. If we are to face a board exam only once, in Class XII, the stress will be considerably reduced, said Sanjana Agarwal, a Class VIII student of Auxilium Convent School.        
	The Class X board examination does not serve any purpose... scrapping the test will minimise the stress on students and parents, Amitabha Basu, whose son studies in Class VIII in a private school.        
	Some school administrators, however, are worried over the implications of the proposed system.        
	Most principals and teachers feel the proposal could not be implemented without addressing other issues such as maintaining the standard of school education and introducing an alternative benchmark to assess the performance of students.        
	Many teachers argued that the board exam in Class X helped build a strong academic foundation among students.        
	The exam tries to ensure students have a basic grasp of all subjects. If the exam is scrapped, most students will concentrate on the subjects they like to pursue at the plus-II level and ignore the rest, said the principal of a reputable ICSE/ISC school in south Calcutta.        
	Teachers and school heads are also worried that making the board test optional would lead to a decline in the standard of secondary education.        
	Scrapping the Class X board test might reduce stress on students but if the intellectual stimulation the exam presents is taken away, the standard might fall, said Malini Bhagat, the principal of Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School.        
	Others stressed the need to create a national-level benchmark to assess students in the absence of the board exam.         
	Sibals proposal to set up a single national-level board for schools across the country has also met with opposition.        
	A single board will not make much of a difference in cities but there are many rural schools where the dropout rate is high. The proposed national-level board would not serve its purpose if the needs of the students in rural areas are not addressed, said Bhagat.

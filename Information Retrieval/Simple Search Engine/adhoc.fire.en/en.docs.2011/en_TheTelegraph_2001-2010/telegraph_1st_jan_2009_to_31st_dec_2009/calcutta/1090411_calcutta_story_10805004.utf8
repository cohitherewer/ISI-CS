          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Doctors removed a five-inch-long mass of hair and other debris from the abdomen of a five-year-old boy at a private hospital in the city recently.        
	Rajiv Sharma (name changed) was suffering from abdominal pain though he had no history of constipation, diarrhoea or other intestinal disorders. Doctors failed to detect the cause despite conducting an ultrasonography and CT scan of the abdomen.        
	There was a tenderness all over Rajivs abdomen and a swelling in the stomach.        
	Rajivs mother said he was in the habit of putting all kinds of substances into his mouth, including hair, thread, cotton, wool and foam, said Kishore Gandhi, a paediatrician at Bhagirathi Neotia Woman and Child Care Centre, where Rajiv was treated.        
	An endoscopy revealed a hairy mass in the stomach, which was taken out through laparotomy.         
	Doctors have diagnosed Rajivs case as trichobezoar  the formation of a mass of hair or hairy substances inside the stomach or intestine.        
	Such a hairy mass forms in the stomach but may descend into the intestine. If not diagnosed early, it may cause complications like yellow vomit, severe abdominal pain and weight loss.        
	The situation could have turned fatal had the mass grown bigger and blocked the intestine, said paediatric surgeon A.K. Basu, who had performed the laparotomy.         
	It is a case of attention deficiency disorder and the child needs counselling, he said. Psychiatrists said the condition was known as trichotillomania and might have been caused by an imbalance of chemicals in the brain.

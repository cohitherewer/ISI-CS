The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Polluting vehicles elude police
                                                                                                               Polluting vehicles elude police
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A three-wheeled goods carriage is all that police managed to seize on Day Five of the crackdown on polluting vehicles.        
	If the banned vehicles are not being taken out, what can we do? was the familiar police excuse for the low seizure count even as the number of private buses, minibuses and taxis on the road increased compared with the first two working days of the week.        
	From Wednesday, the Lalbazar top brass deployed personnel for the crackdown on only one shift  from 8am to 6pm  instead of two.        
	We cannot keep deploying the entire force for the crackdown. There are many other responsibilities, said an officer.        
	About 1,500 government buses, 8,000 private buses, 2,500 minibuses and 32,000 taxis plied in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area on Wednesday. The number of autos  11,000-odd (legal and illegal)  didnt pick up since Tuesday.        
	Transport operators whose vehicles are outside the purview of the ban are taking them out now. Many had chosen not to ply their vehicles to express solidarity with those affected by the ban till the Supreme Court heard the case on August 4, said a leader of the Banijyik Paribahan Bachao Committee, the umbrella body of transport operators.         
	Many have lost patience with no favourable verdict coming our way, he added.         
	Challenging two notifications regarding the conversion of three-wheelers issued by the transport department on January 12 and August 3 this year, the Calcutta Autorickshaw Operators Association filed a petition in the high court on Wednesday. The matter is likely to be heard by Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar on Friday.        
	The auto operators have questioned how the government could arbitrarily choose August 1, 2000, as the cut-off date for allowing conversion of two-stroke autos to LPG mode.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Plastic drive deferred
                                                                            Wednesday , November 18 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Plastic drive deferred
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The civic authorities on Tuesday deferred the planned two-day drive to free the city markets of banned plastic bags under pressure from traders.        
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation had declared last week that officials would visit markets on Tuesday and Wednesday and slap fines on traders and customers found using plastic bags thinner than 40 microns.         
	But on Tuesday, civic officials only advised traders and visitors at eight municipal markets over loudspeakers to not use plastic bags.         
	Representatives of traders associations met us on Monday and requested us to defer the drive by a week since they were not ready with alternatives. So we decided to enforce the ban from next week, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.        
	The awareness campaign will continue for the week. We will start slapping fines from next week. We will also raid shops in Burrabazar where banned plastic bags are sold, said mayoral council member (environment) Sushil Sharma.        
	Plastic bags thinner than 40 microns and smaller than 16 inches x 12 inches are banned in the state since June 2007. Violation of the ban is rampant, including at the eight markets officials visited on Tuesday.        
	According to the notification issued last week, the civic authorities will slap a spot fine of Rs 50 on those who use banned plastic bags. Traders handing out such bags will have to shell out Rs 500.         
	The environment department keeps issuing directives that are never implemented. Stopping the manufacture of banned plastic bags is the only solution, said environmental activist Subhash Dutta.

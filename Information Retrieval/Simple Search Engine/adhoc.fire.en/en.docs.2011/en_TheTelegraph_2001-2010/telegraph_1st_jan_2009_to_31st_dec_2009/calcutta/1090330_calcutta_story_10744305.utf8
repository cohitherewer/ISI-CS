                                                                                                               Laptop mismatch
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Passengers were not allowed to board flights for 15 minutes on Friday evening after an IT professional took away anothers laptop, thinking it to be his.        
	CCTV footage helped the authorities return the laptops to their respective owners, after which the fliers were allowed to leave the security hold. Airport officials said no flight was delayed.        
	Satpal Singh and S.B. Hari, carrying laptops of the same model, arrived at the security check-in at 5.15pm. Singh was bound for Bangalore and Hari, for Chennai.        
	Both deposited the laptops at the X-ray counter. But Singh picked up Haris by mistake and left. When Hari took the other laptop he realised it was not his. He immediately approached the CISF, said an officer.        
	CCTV footage helped the officers track down Singh, who acknowledged his mistake, the officer added.

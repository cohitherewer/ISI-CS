	In its fourth year, the Patton School One-Act Play Competition, hosted by Padatik at Gyan Manch on August 14 and 15, had terrorism and life as its theme. Put up by students, who wrote the scripts, handled the lights and music and designed the costumes, sets and props, the contest was preceded by a workshop.         
	Modern High Schools presentation, Do you have a choice?, narrated the tale of Tara, a young village girl who retaliates violently to poverty and betrayal. Arrested for planting a bomb that killed two children, Tara is told by a counsellor that she was wrong to opt for terrorism. Opening with a dance number, the black and red combination of the dancers costume and the music set the right tone.         
	The La Martiniere for Girls (LMG) production followed a young girl, a bomb-maker, who develops a relationship with her neighbours in a locality where she had been sent to plant a bomb. It stood out for its striking choreography, with a group in black hooded robes tripping mechanically to music upstage.         
	From this group, individuals would dissociate themselves to remove the hood and play their part. When the girl realises the pain her actions have caused and wants to make her instigators pay, she is seen facing a fearsome faceless group that is itself afraid of the conscious individual.         
	Adding a different flavour to the fare was Birla High School for Boys satirical Bengali play, where a terrorist challenges the power of Yama or Death, saying he can cause more death with less trouble and fewer scruples. Though the script offered laughs through puns and one-liners, the scriptwriter tripped in identifying the terrorist with a particular religion.         
	Modern High won the best production award, followed by LMG. The best direction award went to St Augustines Day Schools Revenge and Redemption. Vikram Doshi of St James School, who played the role of Sadhu Mahato, a reformed terrorist, was selected best actor, while Yashna Ray from LMG, who played the bomb-maker, was named best actress.        
	Most of the plays were enjoyable. Our school has a drama club. Perhaps, we will participate next year, said Surjo Chakravarty, of The Future Foundation School.

	Diet blueprint for autism                  Students of Akshar, an inclusive school, where autistic children study along with others      
	There is no single treatment protocol for autistic children. Most individuals respond best to structured behavioural programmes, combined with medicines, explained Manisha Lad, a child nutrition consultant and the founder of Akhil Autism Foundation in New Jersey, US. Lad was speaking on biomedical intervention of children with autism at an event organised by Parent Circle Time Autism Identified (PACTAI), an NGO comprising professionals and parents of children with special needs, on August 22 at Rotary Club of South Calcutta.         
	Autism may occur as a birth defect or may develop within the age of two-and-a-half years, said Lad, whose six-year-old son, Akhil is autistic.         
	Speaking on the diet for autistic children, she explained that parents should avoid giving them milk, wheat and high protein food items, as they affect the behaviour of the child, even inducing him to harm himself. This includes a strict no-no to chocolates, she said.        
	Many special diets have been prescribed for autistic children. This includes the Body Ecology diet that reduces carbohydrate and sugar intake and the Feingold diet that eliminates several artificial colours and flavours, said Lad. These prevent the proliferation of microbes that produce harmful toxins in the body. Parents should also be especially careful about bowel issues, a problem common among special children, she added.         
	Lad spoke about hyperbaric oxygen therapy, (breathing 100 per cent oxygen under increased atmospheric pressure) and classical homoeopathy, that have been known to help autistic children.         
	Lad advised parents of children with special needs to organise, store and retrieve information systematically. Rather than blindly following suggestions, do your own research. The Internet has a wealth of information on autism, she suggested.         
	For Nibedita Ghosh, who has an autistic child, the seminar was an eye-opener. I didnt know about many of these diets. I want to find out more as I think my son might benefit from them, she said.

	CHIT CHAT                  Tips on ethical hacking  
	On August 21, Geekonix, the science club of Techno India, Salt Lake, organised a session on ethical hacking with cyber security expert Ankit Fadia, (picture left).         
	Fadia explained how Internet Protocol (IP) addresses can be acquired through file transfers when we chat with friends on social networking sites. A computer can be hacked using this address. He recalled the instance of a girl in Mumbai whose computer was hacked into and her webcam switched on without her knowledge. The resultant footage was uploaded online by the hacker. He also discussed how search engines like Google can obtain our IP address easily. To protect your identity, use anonymous proxy servers, like www.anonymizer.com, he advised. He also recalled decrypting an email allegedly sent by Osama bin Ladens men.         
	The session was gripping. I came to know much about the cyber world, said Koustav Mazumder, a fourth-year student of electrical engineering and a member of Geekonix.

	Sports and creative fest        
	Abhilakshya, the inter-school fest of Lakshmipat Singhania Academy (LSA), was held on August 7, 10 and 11 at Kala Mandir. It saw more than 15 city schools participating. Deviating from the usual dance and music events, we went for a mix of sports and intellect, said Meena Kak, the school principal.        
	While outdoor events like Something Fishy, Dodgeball and Hot Wheels tested physical fitness, others like Cinerama tested the creative faculty. We got some great videos by students for Cinerama. Perhaps some of these will be the film-makers of tomorrow, said Krishna Nandy, an English teacher at LSA. Other events included the fashion show, Ensemble, and the dance contest, Happy Feet. While Pailan World School rocked the fashion show with its Go Green theme, Bhawanipur Gujarati Education Society School went all out in Happy Feet, with a costume comprising neon lights. LSA was declared the winner, with Birla High School (Boys) and Bhawanipur Gujarati Education Society selected first and second runners-up, respectively.

	Children learnt how to rustle up easy-to-make Mexican dishes at Oxford Bookstore Junior, last month. Titled Viva Mexico!, it saw 20 kids aged four to 10 years trying their hand at bunuelos, a variety of sweet fritters and salsa sauce.

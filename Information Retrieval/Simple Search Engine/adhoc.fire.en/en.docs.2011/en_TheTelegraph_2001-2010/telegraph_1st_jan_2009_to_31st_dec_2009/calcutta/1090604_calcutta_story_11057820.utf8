The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Low salary but wider basket
                                                                                                               Low salary but wider basket
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The meltdown has made a dent in the average salary of the graduating batch of Vinodh Gupta School of Management at IIT Kharagpur but in return the students were rewarded with a wider spectrum of jobs to choose from.        
	The average salary dipped Rs 3 lakh compared with last year, from Rs 11.44 lakh to Rs 8.93 lakh. The highest domestic salary, too, has gone down from Rs 18 lakh to Rs 14.7 lakh.        
	The authorities blame the southward trend of the average salary on the downturn and the increase in the number of PSUs turning up for placement at the 16-year-old B-school.        
	The global slowdown is holding back salaries across the board. Add to that the increased participation of PSUs which have offered an average salary of Rs 6.5 lakh. The combined effect is the dip in the average remuneration, said a member of the placement committee of the management school.        
	But on the positive side, the students had a wider pool to choose from. We had invited more companies this time to offset the downturn impact, the member added.        
	Navaratna PSUs such as BHEL and other major state undertakings like Andrew Yule offered profiles including sales and marketing, international marketing, operations and business development.        
	The recruiters footfall has gone up to 65 from 55 last year. Around 24 per cent of the students signed on with consulting majors such as PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst and Young, KPMG and Deloitte and Wipro Consulting Services.

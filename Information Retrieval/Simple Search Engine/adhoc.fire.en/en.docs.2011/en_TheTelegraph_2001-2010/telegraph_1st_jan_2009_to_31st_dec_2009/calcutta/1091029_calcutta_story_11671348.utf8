          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Wednesday dismissed a plea against the construction of a guest house-cum-education complex at Swabhumi, a heritage park on the EM Bypass. The project has been proposed by Ganapati Park (Swabhumi), a sister concern of the Harsh Neotia-owned Ambuja Group.         
	The Forum for Human, Legal and Ecological Rights, the NGO that had filed the plea, argued that the project would affect the environment. It also alleged that the civic body had violated norms by sanctioning the plan.        
	The division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice B. Somadder said the NGO had no locus standi to move the case as its members were not affected by the project. The NGOs spokesperson said it would move the apex court.         
	Modi bail: The bail plea of Raj Modi, the owner of Vedic Village, was turned down by the chief judicial magistrate of Barasat on Wednesday. The bail pleas of Gaffar and his seven aides were also not granted.        
	Duo held: Mohammed Javed and Aftab Hussain, in their 30s, were arrested at Kamarhati on Wednesday for allegedly cheating a man of Rs 1.13 lakh by promising him a quick loan. Police suspect the duo had cheated several others.        
	Mishap deaths: Two persons died in mishaps on Wednesday. An unidentified middle-aged man was run over by a tram at Behala Chowrasta on Wednesday evening. Cops said the man probably slipped while crossing the tracks. Mohammad Sarik, 15, died after a lorry hit the motorcycle he was riding at the Syed Amir Ali Avenue-Mayfair Road crossing early on Wednesday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Power cuts across city
                                                                                                               Power cuts across city
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Several parts of the city and its neighbourhood suffered power cuts in phases throughout Thursday because of reduced generation at two units of CESC and limited import from other agencies.        
	The utilitys shortfall at 7pm stood at 136 MW, resulting in rotational loadshedding stretching up to 90 minutes.        
	The shortfall was primarily because of reduced generation at the Southern Generating Station and the New Cossipore unit, said a CESC official.        
	The utility apologised for the inconvenience but that did not help the likes of Paromita Roy of Shyambazar.         
	Power cuts have become a regular affair in the area yet again, said a 32-year-old homemaker.

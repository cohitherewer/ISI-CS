                                                                                                               Road mishaps claim two lives
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A youth and a child died in mishaps on Wednesday, one mowed down by a truck and the other by an ambulance.        
	Sushil Mondol, 26, was riding a bicycle near Usha Gate, in south Calcutta, in the afternoon when a loaded lorry knocked him down.        
	Mondol, a carpenter, was taken to MR Bangur Hospital where he was declared dead on arrival. The victim is survived by wife Rupa, a homemaker, and a two-year-old son.        
	The driver fled leaving behind his truck. The vehicle has been seized and brought to Jadavpur police station while Mondols bicycle was taken to the Garia police outpost, said S.K. Chaudhuri, the additional superintendent of police (industrial), South 24-Parganas.        
	I was in the compound of our building when I heard a noise. By the time I turned around the truck was some distance away, said Balai Roy, the gatekeeper of an apartment block on the main road.        
	Residents complained to the police that they had approached a few firemen to take the victim to hospital in their vehicle. But the men refused saying they needed the permission of their seniors, an officer quoted a resident as saying.         
	Sushils wife is in the dark about the mishap. I dont know how to break the news to her, said Sushils cousin Soumen.        
	In another mishap, an ambulance of the Missionaries of Charity mowed down five-year-old Renuja Khatoon at the Mullickbazar crossing around 8.30am.        
	The girl, a pavement-dweller, strayed on to road while playing and was run over by the ambulance. The vehicle has been seized and the driver arrested, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters).

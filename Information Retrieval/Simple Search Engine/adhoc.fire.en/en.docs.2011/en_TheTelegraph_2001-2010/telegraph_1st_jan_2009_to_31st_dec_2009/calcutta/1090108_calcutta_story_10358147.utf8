The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Shades of Riz in youth death
                                                                                                               Shades of Riz in youth death
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Pintu Sharma, who was found dead late on Tuesday                                  
	A young man under pressure to end his relationship with a bank managers daughter was found dead on a rail track on Tuesday night, just like Rizwanur Rahman was around 15 months ago.        
	Pintu Sharma, a 23-year-old commerce graduate employed in a courier company, wanted to marry Suman Rajak, 22, but the girls father didnt approve of the relationship and allegedly used goons to threaten him and his family.         
	Pintu left his Howrah home on Tuesday evening after receiving two calls on his cellphone. He was found dead near Tikiapara railway station around 11.30pm. The wheels of a passing train had cut his body in half.        
	Police said Pintu probably committed suicide but his family screamed murder. They killed my son. Suman Rajaks father Suresh had tried everything to separate his daughter from Pintu, even hiring goons to assault him, the youths mother, Anita, told Metro at their 26 McKenzie Lane home in Howrah.        
	The Rajaks, who stay in Nandibagan, were unavailable for comment.        
	Pintus elder sister Ruby said Suresh Rajak, a manager with a private bank, came to their house a fortnight ago to warn his father Sanjeevan Sharma of dire consequences if they didnt leave his daughter alone. Suresh had allegedly hired the goons who assaulted Pintu in the neighbourhood two weeks before that.        
	The Rajaks are financially better off than the Sharmas, which sources said was the reason why the girls family had been trying to separate the couple. A common friend said Suman knew Pintu for two years and wanted to marry him.        
	The Sharmas first filed a missing diary at Golabari police station around 11am. An unidentified caller informed them around 40 minutes later that a youth resembling Pintu had been found dead at Tikiapara. His father left immediately and identified the body.        
	The missing diary was turned into a complaint about suspected murder after Pintus mother told the police about Sureshs threats.         
	Bharatlal Meena, the superintendent of railway police, said: We have interrogated Suresh and Suman. It appears to be a case of suicide but we need to wait for the post-mortem report.        
	Rizwanurs alleged suicide was the result of a love affair gone sour because of interference by the wealthy family of his wife Priyanka Todi.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Land scam report ready
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Land scam report ready
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Abdur Rezzak Mollah                                  
	Land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah submitted a probe report to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Friday on the land deals struck by the promoters of Vedic Village for a proposed IT township in Rajarhat.         
	The probe committee was set up in September after the Vedic Village arson on August 22 opened a can of worms on forcible acquisition of land in Rajarhat and Bhangar.         
	A source at Writers Buildings said the report talks about illegal land deals struck by promoters of the resort using false documents.         
	Mollah, however, refused to divulge the contents of the report. All I can say is that the committee has submitted the report to me after a two-month investigation in Rajarhat and Bhangar, the minister said.        
	While the land probe was on, Mollah had said he had received reports on the complicity of some employees of his department in questionable land deals and promised to take action against them, if the charges were proved true.         
	The probe report reveals how the Vedic Village promoters bought a few hundred acres in Rajarhat and Bhangar with false rent receipts attached to the land deeds. The matter came to light when they applied for mutation of these plots. As these plots were illegally purchased, they now stand nullified, the source said.        
	A land department official said for mutation applications to be processed, land deeds and the rent receipts collected from the seller must be produced by the buyer. Examination of these receipts and their verification with the land records department revealed that many were fake, the official said.         
	There has been a change in ownership of more than 700 plots in Bhangar and Rajarhat. Of these, more than 400 plots are in Rajarhat, adding up to around 350 acres, he said.        
	The government scrapped the proposed IT township after the Vedic Village flare-up turned the spotlight on the alleged nexus between land sharks and the promoters of the luxury resort.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Traders steal own goods
                                                                                                               Traders steal own goods
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Two traders stand accused of getting their goods stolen from an Ekbalpore godown the authorities had sealed on the charge of non-payment of import duties.        
	Police said burglars hired by Md Niyaz and Saket Sharma had entered the godown after breaking a part of the rear wall. They repaired the wall after taking out the goods worth Rs 30 lakh.        
	Niyaz, 30, who owns garments shops in Fancy Market and Burrabazar, and his business partner Sharma, 36, are absconding. They had moved the Alipore court seeking anticipatory bail but the plea was turned down, said an officer of Ekbalpore police station.        
	Acting on a tip-off, officials of the directorate of revenue intelligence (DRI) and the police had raided the 3 Ibrahim Road godown in August and found a large consignment of garments imported from Bangladesh and other countries.        
	The consignment was unloaded at the Kidderpore dock. The duo managed to ferry it out without paying import duties. They also failed to prove that the consignment was legal, the officer said.        
	Niyaz and Sharma told the raiding team that they would produce all relevant papers and pay up the dues within 10 days. The officials left after sealing the godowns wooden door.        
	The officials waited for 10 days and tried to get in touch with the duo but they were not available. The DRI team raided the godown on September 10 and found it empty, the official said.        
	The door was locked but a part of the rear wall seems to have been repaired recently. We suspect the trader duo were behind the theft because they were absconding and have not lodged an FIR. The burglars entered the godown through the rear wall to avoid suspicion, said the officer.        
	The special section of the port division have taken over the case, said deputy commissioner (port) Asit Pal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A sad story
                                                                                                               A sad story
										      Book Bazaar                        Sen with Mukherjee. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta				                           
	A sad novel was discussed on Tuesday evening at the British Council. Neel Mukherjee, author of Past Continuous, a gay bildungsroman set in Calcutta, Oxford and London that came out a year ago, was in conversation with actress Moon Moon Sen and Bishan Sammadar of the Seagull Foundation for the Arts at the British Council.         
	Sen, in a black and gold salwar-kameez, sat demurely as she listened. You say bleak. But its just so sad, she said.         
	His characters were all losers, not in the American good-for-nothing-way, but in that they had suffered and lost a lot.         
	Sen thought that perhaps the protagonist Ritwik was not gay at all. Perhaps he just fell into a set of incidents. Ive grown up with gay men. One thing Ive noticed about them is that they celebrate their bodies. Ritwik is not like that. He gets involved with ugly people. Ugly minds. Ugly bodies, she said.         
	The words the impossibility of happiness in love touched her. I hope you dont go through life believing that, she added.         
	P.G. Wodehouses name came up when a reader, concerned with the unredemptive portrayal of Calcutta and Oxford, asked if there was anything happy in the book.         
	Ive failed in my ambition to be P.G. Wodehouse. If you want Wodehouse there is plenty here, Mukherjee pointed at the library.         
	But then Wodehouse could be bleak too. The poem Streets from his book The Small Bachelor goes:         
	Streets/ Streets!/ Grim, relentless, sordid streets!/ East, West, North,/ And stretching starkly South;/ Sad hopeless, dismal, cheerless, chilling/ Streets!        
	Men who once were men,/ Women that once were women,/ Children like wizened apes,/ And dogs that snarl and snap and growl and hate./ Streets!

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Chief justice rap for tardy lawyers 
                                                                                                               Chief justice rap for tardy lawyers 
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta High Court Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar on Friday came down on the lawyers, especially those on the state government panel, for delaying proceedings by praying for adjournments.         
	Are we here only to adjourn cases? Are you, the lawyers, paid for filing prayers for adjournment? asked the chief justice when a lawyer on the state panel prayed for adjournment of his case for two weeks as he was not prepared.        
	It is a matter of surprise that the state lawyers find no time to prepare themselves for the cases. Please tell us when you will be ready to argue the case. If you like, we will hear your cases even on Saturdays at our residences, continued the chief justice.        
	Cases are piling up in courts. The courts are made responsible for the situation. But what are the lawyers doing? Adjournment, adjournment and adjournment.        
	The division bench of the chief justice and Justice B. Somadder were scheduled to hear matters related to public interest on Friday. A number of cases could not be heard because of absence of lawyers or prayers for adjournment on various grounds.        
	The chief justice also asked the state panel lawyer to inform the advocate-general of the courts view.

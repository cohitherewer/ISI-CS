The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Forty years of magic
                                                                                                               Forty years of magic
                              Goopy and Bagha sketched by Ray for the film credits                            
	May 8 marked the 40th anniversary of the release of Satyajit Rays Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne. Over the last four decades, the two lost-youths-turned-maverick-musicians have become part of the Bengali psyche.         
	Ray decided to make a film on Upendrakishore Ray Chowdhurys story after his eight-year-old son Sandip complained that all Rays films were serious. So Ray made his first childrens film, though not with child actors or only for children. In the process, transforming his grandfathers simple, powerful fantasy into a magical fable on the absurdity of war.         
	Finding a financer for GooGa BaBa (the Bengali abbreviation) proved an uphill task. Shooting was postponed several times. But when the film was released in 1969, it ran for eight-and-a-half months. The film is still a delight. After 40 years, Goopy and Bagha should have been old now, if they were not perennial, even in the age of Harry Potter.         
	Media professional Dahlia Chakraborty, 27, says she first saw the film in the early Nineties. I sat enthralled by Goopy-Baghas magical feats and fell in love with bhooter raja (the king of ghosts). Since then I have never been able to pass by a bamboo clump without thinking of the shiny, portly king of ghosts, she laughs.        
	As she grew older she realised how Ray took a dig at social hierarchy by creating four classes of ghosts that are constantly fighting one another.         
	Class VIII student Abhrajit Ray is a Pottermaniac, but Goopy and Bagha make his eyes light up. I enjoyed all five Harry Potter films, but I liked Goopy Gyne even better.         
	In the Potter flicks, everything is built on a grand scale, but its the simplicity of Goopy Gyne that makes it special. In Harry Potter, there is a lot of evil, in Goopy Gyne even the villains (the manipulated king of Halla, his nasty prime minister and the menacing magician Borfi) are amusing, he said.         
	Even fast friends Goopy and Bagha became rivals when it came to marrying a princess, the Ray fan smiles.        
	Graphic artist Debasish Deb says that is the magic of Ray. Every time I watch the film, I discover something new. After reading the story, he went back to the film and realised how Ray had changed the sequence of the three boons from the king of ghosts.         
	Upendrakishore had included the ability to travel as the third boon, but Ray moved it up to the second place. That was possibly the handiwork of the wanderlust in Ray, says Deb, a Ray aficionado.         
	Ranadurjay Talukdar, a quiz-master, says he started to appreciate the nuances of Goopy Gyne more after reading about its making in Rays Ekei Boley Shooting and Our Films, Their Films. For the scene where Goopy and Bagha clap their hands and disappear into the sky, Ray asked Rabi Ghosh and Tapen Chattopadhyay to stand on a high pedestal and jump to the ground and shot the sequence in reverse, thereby getting the effect of upward motion, he says.        
	And when one of Baghas magical nagras got lost while shooting, Ray couldnt get an exact replacement. So, there are no close-up shots of the mismatched pair, he reveals.         
	Goopy Gyne was made following two wars India fought  with China in 1962 and with Pakistan in 1965. Seen against this backdrop, one can appreciate Rays message on war, portrayed by juxtaposing the prosperous, peaceful kingdom of Shundi with the under-fed, unhappy subjects of war-crazy Halla. The sequel, Hirak Rajar Deshe, came after the Emergency era, and its political overtones are more pronounced.         
	The film remains as relevant in these times of terror. Goopy and Bagha stopped a war with pots of sweets falling from the sky on a starved nation. Food for thought?                     SAMHITA CHAKRABORTY LAHIRI

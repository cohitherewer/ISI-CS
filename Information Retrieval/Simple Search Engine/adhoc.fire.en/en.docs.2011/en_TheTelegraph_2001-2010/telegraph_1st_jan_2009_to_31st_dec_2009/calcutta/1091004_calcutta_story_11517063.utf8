The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Name models for the city
                                                                                                               Name models for the city
										      caleidoscope                        Shah Rukh Khan, the most well-known Rahul                                
	Among girls, Priyanka is the most common name in Calcutta, which makes the Gandhi siblings  Rahul and Priyanka  name models for Calcuttas youth. Priyanka is followed by Neha, Suman, Sneha and Priya, says Orkuts Zeitgeist list.        
	The Google-owned social networking site will not disclose numbers. Says Rahul Kulkarni, product manager of Google: These interesting titbits help to understand our users better. The list takes a look at what the youth is doing on Orkut, which now has over 17 million active users.         
	It names the most popular communities in Calcutta. Proud to be Bengali tops the community list followed by Orkut  Most Koolest Bengalis. I Just Wanna Love and Be Loved is at the third position, describing what many young Calcuttans really want.         
	IT influence on the city seems to be reflected in the community TCS 2009 Batch, at fourth place, while Chocolates follows sweetly at fifth. Politics is sixth. In Potter-crazy Calcutta, Gryffindor Common Room emerges seventh.        
	The community Stylish People runs close and why not, with the Sabyasachis and the Anamikas around. The community India is at number nine and finally, Calcutta and not Kolkata is at 10, a strong statement against the erasure of the citys past. Well done.         
	Clintons award                       Ruchira Gupta receives the Global Citizen Award from Hollywood star Demi Moore in New York				     
	Ruchira Gupta, who used to work as a journalist in the city, has been honoured with the Clinton Global Citizen Award, a Bill Clinton initiative in the US. An activist, an author and a film-maker, Gupta is the founder of Apne Aap Women Worldwide, an NGO based in Mumbai that works with trafficked children and women.         
	Gupta received the award in New York on September 24 from actress Demi Moore at a Hollywood star-studded ceremony last month.         
	It was attended by Clinton and hosted by Ben Stiller. We had 600 of the most influential with us, from government and corporate sectors, which is a powerful platform, she said.         
	Gupta added that celebrities such as Brad Pitt or Alicia Keyes, unlike their Indian counterparts, were there for their commitment.         
	It will be impossible to tackle the problem of trafficking and prostitution  presently there are 1. 3 million involved in the flesh trade in India alone  unless the different spheres of society come together, Gupta feels. A veteran at the UN for the last decade or so, trying to implement action plans and laws against human trafficking in Asian countries, she is a well-known face at international platforms. She earned an Emmy for Outstanding Investigative Journalism with her first documentary, The Selling of Innocents, in 1997. She went on to lobby for the passage of the Trafficking Victim Protection Act in 2000 in the US and testified before the Liberhans Commission after witnessing the Babri Masjid demolition as a reporter. A believer in Gandhi and his principles ahimsa and antyodaya (development of the weakest in society) Ruchira also adopted these as the motto of her NGO.         
	She is against conspicuous consumption, anti-consumerism being her strategy against the social evil that her NGO is working against. The concept of purchasing is becoming acceptable. Instead of protecting buyers from AIDS, the girls need protection from buyers. Stricter laws to punish buyers will prevent the poor from being victimised, she stresses.         
	Hand-washing rules                 
	Sometimes it helps to be taught the most basic things all over again. Especially in times of trouble. Perhaps that is what prompted an antiseptic products manufacturer to call over a group of unsuspecting journalists after the swine flu outbreak.         
	It turned out to be a session on instructions on hand-washing and other ways of fighting the flu.         
	Someone sneezed in the air-conditioned room. Everyone turned, some glared, others looked worried. The reactions were a fall-out of a long talk on how to sneeze and where (into the crook of the arm). It was announced that the gathering had released 1.5 to 5 lakh germs into the room. Other flu-fighting instructions were issued.         
	You should keep a distance of three feet between you and your family members, the expert said.         
	Only 70 per cent of Indians wash hands for the recommended duration, a Powerpoint presentation declared, citing a survey. Then followed the practical demonstration.         
	An expert proceeded to wash his hands  for at least 20 seconds, as per World Health Organisation guidelines. He showed the steps slowly and deliberately  rub palm to palm, palm over hand, now back of the fingers went the commentary alongside the wash. Then came the invitation from him  Come, wash hands with me.         
	No one budged. The only movement they had in mind at the end of the hour-long talk perhaps was a quick one, to the exit.

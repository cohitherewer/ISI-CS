The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A dark, broken road
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      A dark, broken road
          ONTHESPOT - GARDEN REACH CIRCULAR ROAD                          Heavy vehicles choke Circular Garden Reach Road that remains dark in the absence of street lights. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                  
	Metiabruz is getting isolated from the rest of the city as gigantic containers and heavy goods vehicles choke the connecting Garden Reach Circular (GRC) Road. Absence of street lights and yawning craters caused by heavy vehicular movement add to motorists woes.         
	A stretch of GRC Road from the ITC factory to jetty No. 10 of the Calcutta Port Trust holds up motorists for two to three hours every day, who avoid taking a circuitous route via Taratala bridge that is both time-consuming and expensive.         
	Nimak Mahal Road that starts right opposite the ITC factory and stretches over five gates of the port trust (gates 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9) has neither traffic signals nor traffic police. Poor road condition, absence of footpaths and broken lamp posts make this road accident-prone. A motorist has to squeeze between two or three rows of container vehicles that take up most of the road. A weighbridge right on the middle does not help.        
	Resident speak: There are no traffic signals here and at night the road turns into a death trap A number of accidents take place but all cases are not reported to the police. The road is marked with craters because of the heavy cargo load that it handles each day. The potholes may turn fatal for bikers at night. I think police should ban two-wheelers along this stretch, said Barun Mukhopadhyay, a resident of 24/5B Jai Krishna Pal Road.        
	Traffic snarls are routine here. It is difficult to take a patient to a hospital via this road and there is every possibility that he will die before reaching a doctor. The government and the police should look into this matter seriously, said Jahangir Khan, resident of G340/2 Meher Manzil Road.         
	I usually take this route to reach my office in Kidderpore. I leave home a couple of hours early so that I can reach on time. I think the government should construct a flyover to check traffic congestion here, said Shabir Ahmed, a resident of SA Faroqui Road.        
	Transporter talk: We have been running our transport service from here for over 30 years. It is true that the number of lorries plying on this road has risen. But I dont think lorries or containers create traffic congestion. If the police and the port trust work together for managing the traffic, the situation would be different. For example, in order to unload a container at the port, a truck is stranded for two to three days unless the driver is ready to shell out Rs 1,000 to Rs 2,500 as speed money. It takes two to three days to empty a container which normally should not take more than two hours. So if a truck owner is in a hurry, then he has to pay up for gate clearance. Moreover, the police need to be kept happy or they might slap a case. So another Rs 500 to Rs 1,000 goes to them, said M.C. Prasad, the president of the Truck Owners Association.         
	Cop talk: Traffic snarls are common when we round up illegal vehicles. Besides, the queue of trucks in front of the weigh bridge makes the situation worse. A few days ago we talked to the port trust authorities about street lights, roadside parking, bad condition of roads and traffic signals. We are trying to put traffic signals on the road. The port trust authorities promised to take steps to mitigate the problems, said Debashish Sarkar, the officer-in-charge of West Port Police Station.        
	Port Trust speak: Traffic management is the polices duty. However, we had several rounds of meetings with them to find a way out of the mess, said Calcutta Port Trust chairman Anindya Majumdar.         
	The roads between gates 8 and 9 belong to the port trust while the other roads are maintained by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC). We have already carried out some repair work and those remaining will be finished soon, said A.K. Mehra, the chief engineer of the port trust.         
	CMC speak: We had put a mastic asphalt coating on GRC Road at a cost of Rs 1 crore but big vehicles have damaged the surface again. The road is not fit to handle heavy vehicles, said CMC deputy chief engineer (Roads), Soumitra Bhattacharya.                           TALAT SALAHUDDIN

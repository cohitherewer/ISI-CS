The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | MLA brothers land grab link
                                                                                                               MLA brothers land grab link
          KINSUK BASU                          Gaffar Mollah: the deal-maker                                  
	Gaffar Mollah had struck a deal with Ajijul Islam, the brother of Trinamuls Bhangar MLA Arabul Islam, to acquire around 200 acres for the now-abandoned IT township next to Vedic Village, police said.        
	The project promoters had gifted Ajijul, alias Khude, a new Scorpio as part of the deal, Gaffar apparently told interrogators. Khude is now absconding.        
	The government scrapped Kolkata Links, which was being developed by Vedic Village owner Raj K. Modi and A.N. Shroff of the Diamond group, on September 7 following allegations of forceful land acquisition.        
	Gaffar, the key accused in the Vedic Village flare-up on August 23, was entrusted with acquiring land for the project, which was to come up across 1,200 acres in Rajarhat and Bhangar.        
	Gaffar held sway over much of Rajarhat but his writ did not extend to neighbouring Bhangar, prompting him to take local boy Khudes help. Vedic Village deputy manager Biplab Biswas  arrested in connection with the arson at the resort  knew about the pact, which was struck around eight months ago, said an officer investigating the case.        
	Khude was supposed to acquire around 200 acres, starting from Uttar Gazipur and Uriapara mouzas. According to the arrangement, the Trinamul leaders brother was to report to Gaffar after every move. Khude got his commissions through Gaffar. We dont know the exact amount but it would not have been less than what Gaffar had charged  Rs 20,000 per bigha, the officer added.        
	The sleuths have also learnt that the promoters had prepared a detailed acquisition blueprint for the duo. After a plot was acquired, the owner would be allowed to reap the crop he had sown. Once the plot was finally cleared, Khudes men would cultivate the plot till construction started and the produce would go to Vedic Village. This was done to ensure that villagers did not encroach on acquired plots, said an officer.        
	We are yet to know how much land Khude and his gang had acquired and what price they paid the owners, the officer added.        
	While acquiring land in Rajarhat, Gaffar had allegedly paid Kelobabu, now behind bars, a hefty amount to buy arms and ammunition. These were possibly bought from Munger to intimidate farmers unwilling to part with land, the officer said.         
	Land acquisition has been been a raging issue in Rajarhat New Town as well. Residents of Chapna mouza in the township are writing to Mamata Banerjee, alleging that local Trinamul leaders had joined hands with CPM cadres in pressuring them to part with land for installation of poles for high-tension wires.        
	Modi bail        
	Calcutta High Court on Monday rejected Raj K. Modis bail plea in two criminal cases of murder and forgery lodged against him with Rajarhat police station.        
	The division bench of Justice D.P. Sengupta and Justice S.K. Chakrabarti, however, granted him bail in a third case  related to alleged grabbing of land owned by a woman in Sikhapur mouza in Rajarhat.        
	Modi was arrested on August 29 on charges of murder, attempt to murder, forgery, cheating and using illegal arms and explosives. All his bail pleas were rejected by the Barasat criminal court, prompting him to move the high court.        
	The murder charge against him was filed by Monirul Sardar, whose brother Amarul died when Gaffars men allegedly opened fire during a football match near Vedic Village on August 23.

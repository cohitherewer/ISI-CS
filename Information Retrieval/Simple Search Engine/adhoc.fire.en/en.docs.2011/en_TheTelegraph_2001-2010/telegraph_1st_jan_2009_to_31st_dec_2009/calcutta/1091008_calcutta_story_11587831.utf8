The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Dispute stalls market revamp
                                                                                                               Dispute stalls market revamp
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The construction of a modern flower market at Mullickghat in Howrah has been held up for three years because of a dispute between the CPM and the Trinamul Congress over relocation of traders.        
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) cleared the Rs 26crore revamp and the Centre disbursed its share of Rs 10 crore in early 2007. But no progress has been made because of a tussle between the CPM-controlled Mullickghat Phool Bazar Parichalan Samity and the Trinamul-backed Mullickghat Phool Bazar Bachao Committee.        
	The samity had taken the initiative for the revamp. But the Centre refused to allot funds to the samity, prompting the agri-horticultural department of the government to take over the project. Once the government entered the scene, the Centre released funds.        
	We have constructed stalls on Strand Bank Road for temporary relocation of the 244 flower traders who have shops on the 4.8bigha plot where the new market is supposed to come up. But the Phool Bazar Bachao Committee is instigating the traders not to relocate, said the samity chairman and former MP, Sudhanshu Sil.        
	An official said the agri-horticultural department, which was following the samitys blueprint, had made relocation arrangements only for traders with shops.        
	Over 10,000 flower cultivators visit the market daily. Where will the rest of the traders go till the market is reconstructed? The CPM has influenced CESC into not restoring power to the market after it was destroyed in a fire in April 2008 so that traders vacate the plot. But they will not do so till proper arrangements are made, said Bhanu Charan Sahoo of the committee.        
	Trinamul leaders gathered at the market on Wednesday and threatened an agitation if power was not restored in a week. A CESC official said as far as he was aware the market had not applied for restoration.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rap on six in Manna case 
                                                                                                               Rap on six in Manna case 
          A STAFF REPORTER                           Mannas parents at Raj Bhavan on Tuesday. (Amit Datta)                                  
	Heads rolled on Tuesday for failing to take proper action after Arindam Mannas body was found on a rail track near Mankundu station in Hooghly on February 11.         
	Government Railway Police (GRP) on Tuesday pulled up six officers for their failure in handling the body and started disciplinary proceeding against three officers of the Sheoraphuli GRP.         
	The shake-up came on a day the CID received the second post-mortem report. The report suggests the injuries on the GRP sub-inspectors body were ante-mortem, which means Manna sustained them before he died. The report also said the marks were not from a sharp weapon.        
	Somnath Bhattacharya, the officer-in-charge of Sheoraphuli GRP, and Dushashyan Mondal, an assistant sub-inspector serving under him, were suspended and sub-inspector Ranjit Ghosh was transferred to Kharagpur, a GRP officer said.        
	A source said Mohammed Ali Noor, an inspector of Bandel GRP who covers Sheoraphuli, was censured, while assistant sub-inspector of police, Yogesh Mullick, and constable Gour Hari Pramanik were shunted out to Kharagpur.        
	A committee led by inspector-general (railways) Amar Kanti Sarkar looked into the possible lapses in handling Mannas body. Tuesdays action comes on the basis of this report, said Dilip Mitra, the additional director-general of GRP.        
	The CID asked three officers of Dum Dum GRP about Mannas professional life and whether there was any problem at his workplace that could have led to his death.        
	A CID team visited Dum Dum GRP and collected personal diaries, case diaries and bank papers from Mannas locker.         
	Mannas parents met governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi on Tuesday and requested for a CBI probe into their sons death.

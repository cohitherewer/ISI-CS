          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Four children died of suspected food poisoning on Sunday morning.        
	Sultana Khatoon, 15, and her eight-year-old cousin Nausin Shamim were from Samsur Hooda Road near Park Circus. Azadar Hussain and his brother Ayettehsham were residents of Narkeldanga.        
	Police suspect the families ate stale food at dinner the previous night. Neighbours became suspicious after noticing that the Khatoons, known to be early risers, were not coming out even at 9.30am.        
	After their repeated knocks, Ruksana Khatoon opened the door. Seeing her unsteady gait, the neighbours sensed something was amiss.        
	They peeped in and saw Zubeda, Sultana and Shamim were frothing at the mouth. Ruksana, too, passed out soon after.        
	All four were taken to Calcutta National Medical College where Sultana and Nausin were declared dead. Zubeda and Ruksana were in a critical condition.        
	Azadar Hussain, 13, died at NRS hospital, with doctors suspecting food poisoning as the cause.        
	His brother Ayettehsham, 11, died at night.        
	Their parents and another brother are being treated at the hospital. No police complaint was lodged.

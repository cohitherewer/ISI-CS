                      An eternal bond                    Rich in human interest, mother-and-child, as a theme, has been given celebrated classic expressions in such masterpieces as Michelangelos Pieta, Raphaels Madonna and nearer home in Jamini Roys paintings of the same title as well as Jainul Abedins famine drawings in which a famished mother with her skin-and-bone children fleshes out the terrible pity and terror of starvation. There has been no elemental change in the relation between a mother and a child despite several paradigm shifts that have taken place since the days when a womans primary role was to bear and rear children. Artists, therefore, asked to paint or sculpt a very traditional subject in two very traditional genres found the task quite challenging and have turned out works that have an engaging range in terms of conceptual and formal content. Thus, at the ongoing art show Mother amp; Child, most artists have either treated the theme with straightforward mother-and-child motifs or their analogous counterparts drawn from the world of flora or fauna. They have addressed the theme with varied recycling of the pristine notion of the mother-and-child ties evident not only in human instances but also in the entire living world in which the feminine species is the exclusive conduit of life force flowing from generation to generation. Participants include Anjali Ela Menon, Sunil Das, Jogen Chowdhury, Suhas Roy, Prokash Karmakar (a painting by him appears here), Prasanta Sahu, Shuvaprasanna, Chandrima Bhattacharya, Mehjabin Mazumdar, Samir Aich and Rajan Krishnan.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Death nudge for speed governor
                                                                                                               Death nudge for speed governor
          OUR BUREAU                                              The minibus wreckage on the railway tracks after it tumbled off Bankim Setu on Saturday evening
      
	Twelve deaths in one mishap have finally nudged the state transport department to try and implement a Supreme Court order aimed at reining in the speed monster.        
	Transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury said on Monday that no heavy commercial vehicle would be issued a fitness certificate unless its engine was fitted with the speed governor.        
	It will be mandatory for all heavy commercial vehicles to be fitted with the speed governor. Otherwise, they wont be issued the fitness certificate without which a vehicle cannot hit the road, Chowdhury asserted.        
	The Supreme Court had a few years ago made it mandatory for all heavy vehicles to be fitted with the gadget. Insiders in the transport department admitted the government had not been serious in enforcing the order.        
	The speed governor  much like an oversized screw that is attached to the engine  will ensure that vehicles do not cross the speed limit even if the drivers want to. The speed limit for buses and minibuses has been fixed at 50 km per hour and that of schoolbuses at 40 km per hour.         
	The Sankrail-Howrah minibus that crashed through the railing of Bankim Setu on Saturday lost control while trying to overtake another bus from the left at a high speed. The accident could have been averted had the bus been fitted with a speed governor, said a senior officer of the state traffic police.         
	Transport secretary Chowdhuri will meet representatives of the city traffic police and their counterparts in the districts on Tuesday to discuss the modality of implementing the order.        
	The secretarys announcement comes three days after Nazrul Islam, the additional director-general of police (traffic), had shot off a letter to the government seeking a clear directive on how to book vehicles plying without the speed governor.        
	However, speed governors alone cannot restore order on the road, said Islam. There is an acute shortage of cops to manage traffic in Howrah and some other parts of the city. There are only 14,000 traffic cops in the districts against the sanctioned strength of 28,000. We have requested the government to specify how the vacant posts would be filled up.        
	Two days after the Bankim Setu tragedy that claimed 12 lives, the police were still waiting to interrogate driver Vivekananda Parui and cleaner Mohammad Firdous, now undergoing treatment at Howrah District Hospital.        
	Congress supporters on Monday afternoon blocked Bankim Setu and gheraoed the office of the Howrah district magistrate, demanding the abolition of the commission system of payment for bus drivers and conductors.

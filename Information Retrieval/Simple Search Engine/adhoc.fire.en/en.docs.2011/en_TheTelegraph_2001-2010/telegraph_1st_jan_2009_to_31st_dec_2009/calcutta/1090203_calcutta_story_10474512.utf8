The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | State bus fares to be reduced
                                                                                                               State bus fares to be reduced
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The fares of state buses, including those plying on long routes, will be reduced in line with the cut in fares of private buses, minibuses and taxis, transport minister Subhas Chakraborty said on Monday.        
	The Calcutta State Transport Corporation and the West Bengal Surface Transport Corporation together ply over 150 long-distance buses and around 900 in the city.        
	The revised fares will come into effect from February 10. I will sign the notification (on fare cuts for both state and private buses, as well as minibuses and taxis) tomorrow after meeting representatives of transport organisations, Chakraborty said on Monday.        
	The government is yet to decide on the extent of reduction of fares for its buses, which is now 50 paise per km. For the state buses plying in the city, the revised fares will be the same as those applicable to private vehicles.        
	Last Friday, the government had announced a reduction of fares for private buses, minibuses and taxis following 1.07-per cent (29 paise) cut in sales tax on diesel.        
	The transport minister ruled out any further revision of fares after the meeting with the transport operators. There is no question of any more revision as the bus operators have agreed to the reduced fares. The meeting is a formality before the issuance of the notification, he added.        
	Members of the Bengal Taxi Association met the minister during the day and accepted the new fares. The cabs will now charge Rs 20 for the first 2 km (lower by Rs 2) and Rs 2 for every 200 metres thereafter.        
	The minister also made it clear that registered autorickshaws would not be allowed to carry more than four passengers.

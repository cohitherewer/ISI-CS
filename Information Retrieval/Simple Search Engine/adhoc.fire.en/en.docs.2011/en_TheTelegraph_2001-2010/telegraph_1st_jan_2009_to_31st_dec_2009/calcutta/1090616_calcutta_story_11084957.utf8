The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | City lags in cellphone tower policy
                                                                                                               City lags in cellphone tower policy

	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation is yet to come up with a policy for cellphone towers more than six months after the much smaller Kalyani Municipality became the first civic body in Bengal to ban such towers on residential buildings.        
	Cellphone towers were banned on school and hospital premises and atop buildings in narrow lanes across the state by the environment department last year.         
	Scientists have warned that radiation from cellphone towers might cause cancer and genetic defects.        
	Recently, a tower on a residential building on Lenin Sarani had caught fire. Diesel is often stocked to run generators that provide power back-up to cellphone towers, posing a fire hazard.        
	The city civic body, however, is yet to wake up to the dangers posed by the towers. We only check the structural stability of buildings on which cellphone towers are erected. There is no infrastructure or provision under civic norms to check whether the towers are otherwise safe or not, said a senior civic official.         
	A policy for cellphone towers is unlikely to be drafted in the near future, added the official.         
	Kalyani Municipality in contrast has been implementing its ban on cellphone towers on residential buildings for months now.         
	The 20-odd cellphone towers set up in Kalyani in the past six months are all located either near garbage dumps, along railway tracks and canals, in other open spaces or on top of select commercial establishments.         
	The municipality now decides whether a tower can be erected at a particular spot or not. Access to base transmission stations has also been restricted.        
	Cellphone towers were coming up on top of houses, which is dangerous. Absence of guidelines was an impediment to crackdown. But last year the environment department had laid down a set of norms in this regard. We banned random installation of towers in our area in end-2008 after a resolution in our board meeting, said Shantanu Jha, the chairman of Kalyani Municipality.        
	A panel comprising the local councillor, a civic inspector with technical know-how and a representative of the service provider supervises the installation of each tower. The service provider has to get in touch with the municipality first, added Jha, whose municipality has won Environment Excellence Award, handed out by environment department, and the Clean City Award twice each.        
	The municipality also issued orders for removing the towers that were installed on residential buildings in its 19 wards before the ban, said Shyamal Roy Majumdar, the market inspector of the civic body, which has a population of about 2 lakh.         
	According to officials of the environment department, the CMC too can control random installation of cellphone towers. If there is a will such a decision can be taken easily. The mayor along with mayoral council members can adopt a policy. A small committee like the one Kalyani Municipality has formed can be formed by the CMC too to supervise the installation of towers. If space is a constraint then they can convince several providers to use a common tower like in Kalyani Municipality, said an official.         
	Municipalities without a policy can also take action against violators under the Environment Protection Act. The act empowers officials to register an FIR, issue prohibitory orders and file a case.

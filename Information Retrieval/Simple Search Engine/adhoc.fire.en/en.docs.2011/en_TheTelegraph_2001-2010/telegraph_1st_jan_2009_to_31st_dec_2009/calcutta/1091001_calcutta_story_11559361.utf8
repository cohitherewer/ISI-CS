The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pass the buck over Puja litter
                                                                                                               Pass the buck over Puja litter
          JAYANTA BASU                          Two youths retrieve the bamboo framework of an idol from the Hooghly on Tuesday. Picture by Amit Datta                                  
	Pollution of the Hooghly because of idol immersion has continued unabated this year with recommendations of the central and state pollution control boards remaining on paper and the civic body and the port trust blaming each other.        
	Metro watched immersions in six ghats in Calcutta and Howrah on Monday night and found garbage heaped near the water. There was no system in place to recover the immersed idols. Only some local boys were trying to retrieve the bamboo frameworks to sell them to idol-makers.        
	Plaster Of Paris, baked clay and various toxic chemicals used on idols and the items that adorn them pollute the water, affecting the aquatic ecosystem and posing health hazards.         
	The central pollution control board had found more than a decade back that the level of pollutants in the river went up significantly after Durga puja immersions. The volume of immersions has gone up since then.        
	About 1,500 of our men along with NGO employees have been working through the night at 40 ghats in the city to minimise pollution as far as possible. But we cannot clean the river once the idols are immersed, said Faiyaz Ahmed Khan, the mayoral council member of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.        
	He claimed that cleaning the river was the responsibility of Calcutta Port Trust.         
	The state pollution control board issued a directive in 2004 stating that the municipalities were responsible for cleaning the river after immersion. It is impossible for us to clean this vast stretch of river after immersion, said Arun Nath, officer on special duty (environment), Calcutta Port Trust.        
	In 2002-03, Central Pollution Control Board had recommended earmarking of areas for immersions and if possible, restricting immersions to a confined water body; collection of flowers and leaves in containers; recycling of items used on idols and use of biodegradable dyes and paint.         
	Prodded by the high court, the state pollution control board in the 2004 directive asked puja organisers to retrieve waste from the river after immersion and observed that municipal authorities might realise a cleaning cost from puja organisers.

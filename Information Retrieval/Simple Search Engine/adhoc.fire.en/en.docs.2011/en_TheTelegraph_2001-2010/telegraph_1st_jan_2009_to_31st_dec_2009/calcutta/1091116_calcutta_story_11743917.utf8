          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	All that students in Calcutta wanted to know about studying in the UK or the US will be made available to them on a platter this week.         
	The British Council and the American Center are organising exhibitions in the city to acquaint students with studying in the two countries.         
	Both Study America Fest and the UK event, A Festival of Bright Ideas, will provide information on educational institutions, answers to visa-related queries and a picture of what to expect when heading to the UK and the US for studies.        
	The aim is to bring the universities to students so that they get a chance to have their questions answered face-to-face, said Marina Gandhi, the head (education) of British Council East India.        
	The exhibition, to be attended by representatives of over 45 UK universities, will be held at the Taj Bengal on Tuesday and Wednesday.        
	For those who want to head to the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, the Study America Fest, starting on Monday at the American Center, will provide the answers.        
	The three-day exhibition, organised to observe the International Education Week, will showcase posters and information tables on US universities. Seminars will be held on student visa, crafting a research proposal and graduate and undergraduate studies in the US.        
	Presentations will be organised on important tests like the GRE, GMAT, SAT and the TOEFL. Students will get opportunities to discuss money matters, internship opportunities, academic issues and expectations from foreign students in the classroom and outside with those already studying in the US and faculty members there.        
	The UK exhibition will provide information on diploma, undergraduate and postgraduate courses in a range of subjects, scholarships and the visa process. Seminars will be organised on careers in business management, information technology, engineering and law.         
	Students planning to go to the US typically start applying to the universities around this time. This annual event will help create awareness among them, said Gandhi.        
	Those visiting the Taj Bengal fair can become familiar with a typical student accommodation in the UK by walking into the replica of a study-bedroom unit.         
	This is a new initiative which has been designed to help students understand what their home in the UK will be like and how they could make themselves comfortable there, said Gandhi.

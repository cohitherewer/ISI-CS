The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Teachers boycott classes
                                                                                                               Teachers boycott classes
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The 50-odd teachers of Rajasthan Vidya Mandir boycotted classes on Monday to protest the authorities attempt to insult them by calling in police during a discussion on a pay hike. The 1,000-plus girls who study in the Girish Park school returned home after being told that classes would not be held.        
	The teachers have not been accepting their salaries for four months, protesting extremely low pay compared with other ICSE schools. A dozen policemen entered the room while we were discussing our demands with the authorities on Friday evening. We felt insulted since the policemen interrogated us as if we were creating trouble, said Basabi Bose, a senior teacher.        
	According to the teachers, the school has not implemented the Fourth Pay Commissions recommendations while most schools are about to put into force the Fifth Pay Commissions suggestions. They have decided not to take classes till the authorities apologise for Fridays incident.        
	Kajari Mukherjee, the principal, said she was not in the school when Fridays meeting was held. I have urged the management to look into the demands of the teachers.

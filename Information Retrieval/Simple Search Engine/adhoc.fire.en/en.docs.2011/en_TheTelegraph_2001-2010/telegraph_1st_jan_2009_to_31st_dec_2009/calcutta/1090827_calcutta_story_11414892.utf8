                                                                                                                   Kids on the ball         Subhajoy Roy      Young Metro                           Participants battle it out on the Vivekananda Park grounds at the finals of the Suthol TTIS Shootout on August 22.

	Several missed chances and a single goal scored in the first half marked the finals of Suthol TTIS Shootout, the five-a-side football tournament held at the Vivekananda Park grounds on August 21 and 22. St Xaviers Institution, Panihati, emerged champions, defeating Serampore Union Institution by one goal. The tournament, that saw 224 teams fighting it out for the crown, had kicked off on July 27.         
	While there were 16 teams from Midnapore, Bankura, Asansol and Burdwan districts, the city had 64 teams in the fray in the selection round. One team from each zone was selected for the finals that saw the districts reign. The sole Calcutta team in the finals, MP Birla Foundation, was ousted in its first match.        
	We had to play three 40-minute matches in the finals, said Shirshendu Sarkar, a Class XII student of St Xaviers Institution. He was declared the Man of the Final, for scoring the lone goal that was the match-winner.         
	It was a dream come true for me to win from such a huge platform, said Sarkar.         
	But it was no cakewalk for the winners. Serampore Union came very close to scoring the equaliser, but the net always eluded them as they failed to convert close chances. The coordination between the players failed at crucial moments, as they did not release the ball near the goal, which could have changed their fortune.         
	Samudyuti Putatunda, a Class XII student from the school, was selected Player of the Tournament.         
	The Bhaichung Bhutia and Christiano Ronaldo fan dreams of playing for one of the major city clubs in future.        
	The prize for Best Goalkeeper went to Narayan Sahu of Eastern Railway Hindi High School, Howrah, while Siliguri Vivekananda Vidyalaya won the Fair Play trophy.         
	The tournament was divided into junior (classes IV to VI) and senior (classes VII to XII) categories. There were no mega finals for the junior category. We felicitated the zonal winners in this section, said an organiser.         
	Former India player and veteran coach P.K. Banerjee was present as chief guest for the finals. He met us and asked us to uphold the spirit of the game, said Sarkar.         
	Mohun Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa gave away the prizes to the winners.                        Quizmaster Derek O rsquo;Brien with some participants at the city finals of the Limca quiz    
	Silver for dark horse         
	What did Nabin Chandra Das do in 1868? He invented the rosogolla, came the reply from Don Bosco School, Park Circus (DBPC) team in the last round of the city finals of Limca Book of Records quiz, held at Army Public School, Ballygunge, in the last week of July.         
	Six of the 186 teams from 83 schools that included La Martiniere for Boys and St James, made it to the top of the quiz. The quiz, open to students from classes VIII to XII, is being held across 75 cities in three stages: inter-school, semi-finals and national finals, from April to December.        
	While DBPC walked away with the gold medal and Lakshmipat Singhania Academy with the bronze, the dark horse, Young Horizons School, Kalikapur, stole the show and walked away with silver, to the admiration of quizmaster Derek OBrien. We had not hoped to make it to the top six teams, with so many well-known schools present, said team member Mayukh Dasgupta. Bhartiya Vidya Bhavan, Julien Day School, Elgin Road, and Frank Anthony Public School also made it to the city finals.         
	It included five rounds, with the rounds named after Twenty-20 cricket, and included items like an auction and cheerleaders.         
	Many of the questions tested the participants knowledge of the mundane, from identifying the book Treasure Island, naming a 14.2-hand-high animal (the horse) to recognising the voice of Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah.         
	The top 10 teams from four zones will be selected for the National final.

	I-Day with a difference  
	BD Memorial Institute celebrated Independence Day with a difference this year. Titled Moti aur Maniyan Meri Dharti Ki, it saw students, parents and teachers participating on the same platform.         
	First up was an extempore, in which participants spoke on the subject Have we achieved real independence?, followed by a debate on the topic Spare the rod and spoil the child, with parents and teachers included on the panel of speakers. A quiz on the school saw the students joining in enthusiastically.        
	A fashion show showcasing gallant women from the pre and post-independent era and an audio-visual montage with students and guardians paired as famed duos from history, politics and mythology, followed.         
	A poster and T-shirt painting contest showcased the harm caused by drugs and smoking.         
	A tiffin exhibition, testing the culinary dexterity of the moms, was popular with students and parents alike. A compatibility test judged by school principal Vijaya Chaudhuri, that tested the extent to which students and guardians got along with each other, brought the day to a fitting close.

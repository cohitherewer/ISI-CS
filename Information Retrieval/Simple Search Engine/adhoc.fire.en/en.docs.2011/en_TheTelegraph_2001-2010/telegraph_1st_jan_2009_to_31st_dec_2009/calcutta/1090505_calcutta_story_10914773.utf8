The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Trinamul in sari fray
                                                                                                               Trinamul in sari fray

	The Trinamul Congress has come up with its own sari to take on the nine yards specially designed for the CPM campaign.        
	On Sunday, Trinamul supporters wore the sari with the partys symbol at a rally in New Alipore, under Mamata Banerjees constituency Calcutta South.        
	The sari is the brainchild of Trinamul leader Arup Biswas who recently organised a rally with participants wearing Mamata masks.        
	The sari carries the message the Trinamul wants to convey to the people and is not just a means to display the party symbol, said Biswas, who also came up with the design.        
	The cotton sari has a tricolour border with the Trinamul symbol  grass and flower  printed prominently all over the white base. The anchal has Mamata Banerjees name written in red along with the party slogan maa, maati, manush.        
	Biswas denied the Trinamul sari was inspired by the CPM sari, first seen on Poila Baisakh. The sari is an answer to the CPMs expensive campaign tactics that include sending text messages, using the Internet and billboards made by agencies, said the Trinamul leader.        
	Around 500 Trinamul saris, costing Rs 100 each, have been distributed among supporters. Everyone wants the saris now. We have ordered more saris, said Biswas.

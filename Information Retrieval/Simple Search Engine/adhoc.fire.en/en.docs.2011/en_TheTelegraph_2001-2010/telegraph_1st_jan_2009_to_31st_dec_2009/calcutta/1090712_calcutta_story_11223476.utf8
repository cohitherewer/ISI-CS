	Rarely are paintings by Mizo artists ever seen here. So the Mizoram government decided to hold an exhibition of contemporary artists from this north-eastern state at Gaganendra Pradarsasala. The Mizos are famous for their handicrafts and the bamboo dance, and the watercolour artists have depicted the idyllic lives of Mizos in their villages with thatched huts.        
	Most of the participants were taught painting in Delhi and Myanmar, which is close to this state and relatively cheap. Many of the artists are auto-didacts but are skilled and self-confident. They are simple and unpretentious works. The watercolours show a horse running wildly and the cosy huts with kitchen utensils inside for cooking meals. The villages seem to be far from the hustle and bustle of cities.         
	There are larger paintings as well depicting the bamboo dance and joyous young men and women in their colourful garments. The best painting is a variation on the time-worn theme of Death and the Maiden. Only Death is a nude young man who wears a skull. The other is a study of two male artists models posing inside a studio. They are naked and have been depicted full frontal. This is rarely done by artists from this city. But the paintings showing Mother Teresa and Mahatma Gandhi are rather flat and show little imagination in their execution. However the beauty of the mother and child painting makes up for this deficiency.        
	There are several works depicting the beauty of nature in Mizoram. The awesome precipices, forests and hills are truly spectacular. The exhibition was organised by the Information and Public Relations department. Perhaps the department should now hold a large exhibition of traditional handicrafts as well.

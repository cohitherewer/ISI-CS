                                                                                                               Wheels of life, death
          A STAFF REPORTER                                                Rohan Sengupta, who was a guitarist and rally driver		      
	A day after three young lives were lost in a car crash near Eden Gardens following a night out on Park Street, a large circle of friends struggled to come to terms with a tragedy that, as one of them said, could happen to any one of us.        
	Guddu...tui ei bhabe chole jabi bhabini (never thought you would leave like this)...I love u...will miss u...jekhanei thakish bhalo thakish (stay well, wherever you are), wrote Riddhi, Rohan Senguptas friend in his scrapbook on Orkut, the online social networking community.        
	Known in the citys music and rally circuits as Guddu, Rohan, 26, was a bass guitarist who lived and breathed cars.        
	He slipped behind the wheel  of a black Maruti Swift  one last time with Saibal Banerjee, 26, and Gairik Som Basu, 21, in the back seat.        
	Around 1.25am on Tuesday, the car crashed into a heavy vehicle  unidentified till late on Wednesday  killing Saibal and Gairik instantly and fatally wounding Rohan. The car was smashed beyond recognition.        
	One only saw Guddu in modified cars. He was a great driver and he never lost control at the wheel. It must have been the other drivers callousness, said Neel Adhikari, frontman for the bands SPAN and Five Little Indians.        
	Police sources said the speeding car had probably smashed into a truck coming down the wrong lane, possibly without the headlights on.        
	Trucks speeding with headlights off is a common sight at night in the Maidan area, said a police official.        
	Rohan, who lost his mother at a young age, lived with his retired father Dipak Sengupta in Patuli. His elder brother works abroad.        
	Rohan, who loved partying and socialising, would hang out with members of Calcuttas leading bands. Insomnias manager Rahul Mehra met him in a hotel lobby hours before his death. He used to drive us to and from concerts in various parts of eastern India, said Rahul.        
	On Monday night, Rohan was out celebrating a job offer that Saibal, a bartender in KKs Fusion, had got.        
	Friends described Saibal as a very decent guy who tried hard not to disappoint anyone.        
	Gairik, the youngest of the three, was a BBA student who loved cars, liked hanging out with friends and dreamt big.        
	Dreams that died in a heap of mangled metal after a joyride with friends.

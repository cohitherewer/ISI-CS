	Kirit Kumar Mehta was stunned when cops impounded his new car after he parked on Radhabazar Street in central Calcutta on Tuesday.        
	I was bewildered as I hadnt broken any traffic rule. Then I realised I was being booked for driving a car without valid registration number. My car just had a temporary trade certificate (TC) symbol, he said.        
	The trader said he had no clue that it was illegal to drive a car with a TC number. The car dealer had assured me that I could use the car with the TC number till I got my registration number, said Mehta, who bought his car on Ashtami morning.        
	Mehta is not the only one in the dark about the legality of the TC number. The police impounded seven vehicles in the city on Tuesday for plying without registration plates.         
	The TC number is strictly meant for use by motor dealers. The dealer can use it while transporting the vehicle from the manufacturing unit to the store or garage. It can also be used for test rides, explained an official of the public vehicles department.         
	Car owners are not allowed to ply their vehicles with such a number plate, he added. The police have launched a drive against vehicles using the TC number after sale, which can attract a fine of up to Rs 3,000 for the first time and Rs 6,000 on subsequent occasions for private cars and two-wheelers.        
	Such vehicles are a threat to law and order as the user can commit crime and escape as we cannot trace him/her in the absence of a registration number. Also, the owner of such a vehicle cannot claim insurance in case of an accident, said K. Harirajan, the additional commissioner of police (I).        
	He said car dealers were responsible for the increasing use of TC-registered vehicles. The dealers, however, blamed the customers. They want immediate delivery. Given the competition, we are forced to allow the cars to leave with a TC registration, said an employee of a two-wheeler showroom in south Calcutta.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mall theft-suicide charge a lie: sons
                                                                                                               Mall theft-suicide charge a lie: sons
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Mrityunjoy Ghosh                                  
	Mrityunjoy Ghoshs sons said they would never believe that their father could stoop so low as to steal a pouch of mustard oil, which reportedly led to his suicide in the Camac Street outlet of Pantaloons on Tuesday afternoon.        
	A packet of stolen mustard oil is what we can do without, said Manojit, the elder son of the 52-year-old, who worked for a private firm that looked after the loading and unloading of goods at the store.         
	Speaking in the drawing room of their two-storeyed house in Sonarpur, Manojit added: We are quite well-off and dont need to steal. The earnings from around the 70 bighas of agricultural land we own with other branches of the family are enough to sustain us throughout the year. My father did not steal anything from the store. There must be some foul play behind his death.        
	Deputy commissioner (south) Rajesh Subarno, however, said Ghoshs death was a clear case of suicide. But we are still carrying out the investigation.        
	Manojit and younger brother Shanu, both college students, said Ghosh had joined work not for money. The salary he got was a paltry Rs 2,500. He had been mostly sitting idle at home since his fishery business closed down two years ago. So he decided to work, said Manojit.         
	The Pantaloons authorities claimed that Ghosh, who had been working in the store for the past year, had been caught leaving for home late on Monday with a stolen mustard oil packet.         
	The guards let him go that night. When Ghosh turned up the next morning, he was made to wait till the managers spoke to him and allowed him to join work. Pantaloons officials said Ghosh hung around for some time and then disappeared. Around 3.30pm, they found him hanging in the air ventilation unit of the third-floor store, an official said.         
	Both brothers said they had seen nothing unusual in their fathers behaviour on Monday night. Had he really stolen anything from the store, he would not have considered going back. But since early on Tuesday morning he had been hurrying to report for work, recalled Shanu.         
	Manojit alleged that a company official had asked him not to raise a hue and cry over his fathers death and assured him that he and his brother would be given jobs and money.         
	The company, however, denied the charge. We didnt make any such offer to the youth, said an official.         
	Officers from Shakespeare Sarani police station on Thursday visited the air ventilation unit and collected a few samples. The cops also measured the height of an iron scaffolding in the room that Ghosh had allegedly used to hang himself.        
	He must have been aware of the fact that bales of plastic tapes were kept in the store. Ligature marks were found on his neck and he even passed stool, said an officer.

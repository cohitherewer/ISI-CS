The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Its the Ash effect in Agarpara
                                                                                                               Its the Ash effect in Agarpara
  - Vendors make merry as fans flock to catch a glimpse of Bachchan bahu          MOHUA DAS                          EYE SPY: Little big fans of Aishwarya peer through slits in the Saheb Kuthi gate on Tuesday afternoon. (Aranya Sen)				                                       
	Aishwarya Rai Bachchan may or may not have made Ratnams day, but she sure made Rajinders.        
	The balding man wheeled his MAK ice-cream van into Elias Road on Tuesday afternoon and parked it close to the closed blue gates of Saheb Kuthi where the Bachchan bahu began her Calcutta leg of the Raavan shoot for Mani Ratnams latest.        
	I heard about Aishwarya shooting here and knew there would be a crowd outside. And everyone likes an ice cream, smiled Rajinder, who had sold ice lollies worth Rs 60 within an hour of setting up shop.        
	The Ash effect turned sleepy Elias Road in Agarpara into a bustling food-and-footfall street on Tuesday. Some children in school uniform waited patiently for their favourite heroine to emerge from the bungalow by the Hooghly. A group of adventurous youngsters clambered up walls and trees to catch a glimpse of the biggest star to visit Agarpara. Peeping Toms  daughters and mothers, middle-aged men and little boys  were thwarted by a pink sheet blocking the slits in the blue gate.                  Where the fans would love to be: the first-floor window of Saheb Kuthi. (Aranya Sen)
    
	What if the gates had parted? The fans could have spied their favourite as Sita 2009  first in jeans and a green top in the living room, and then in a ghagra on the first floor. If the morning saw the star on a treadmill, the afternoon glimpsed her in a dance sequence in a naachghar complete with the sitar, tabla and other musical instruments.        
	The stars on this side of the great divide were Rajinder the ice-cream man, Gurfan the grapeseller and Surinder the phuchkawallah.  
	For it was left to these three vendors to lift the spirits of the foiled fans mdash; from nine-year-old Koushik who cried ldquo;I rsquo;ve seen her on TV, now I want to see her for real rdquo; to homemaker Sumitra Biswas who made it clear she was there for ldquo;Aishwarya, not Abhishek rdquo;.  
	Those who stuck it out till the end of the day had something to cheer about mdash; at 6pm, as Ash breezed out in an Innova, hair tied back, she smiled and she waved.

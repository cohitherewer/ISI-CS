The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A bridge too risky
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      A bridge too risky

	The bridge connecting Cossipore Road with Khirode Vidya Binode Avenue, popularly known as Chitpur bridge, has turned into a potential mishap zone.         
	Frequented by goods vehicles, four-wheelers and motorcycles, Chitpur bridge has only one sidewalk, forcing pedestrians to do a tight-rope walk as vehicles zoom past them. There is no pedestrian railing to prevent vehicles from straying to the sidewalk.         
	The pavement is too narrow to accommodate pedestrian flow from both ends of the bridge. I have seen even four-wheelers climbing on to the pavement at times, said Anup Kumar Chaurasia, a Class XI student of Adarsh Madhyamik Vidyalaya. Adarsh uses the Chitpur bridge to reach his school at 6/A BT Road. There is no footpath at the point where the bridge meets Khirode Vidya Binode Avenue. So sometimes vehicles graze past pedestrians, added his friend Abhishek Upadhyay.         
	The bridge has been in a dilapidated state for long. We use the bridge as it helps us reach Shyambazar faster, said Gupteswar Upadhyay, a resident of Cossipore Road.         
	The Congress councillor of the civic bodys ward 6 passed the buck to police for overlooking the danger zone.         
	I had brought the matter to the notice of Calcutta police but it has served no purpose. The police are installing pedestrian railings across the city, including the Tallah bridge. So, why this apathy towards Chitpur bridge? asked councillor Suman Singh.         
	Construction work on the Chitpur bridge was started by the police a year and a half ago but stopped midway, she added. But the police had another story to tell.         
	We had finished the construction work but local people broke the railings and made off with the metal bars, said a senior officer. He said other places in the city were far more dangerous. We are prioritising the work of installing pedestrian railings accordingly. The work on Chitpur bridge is in the pipeline, he added.

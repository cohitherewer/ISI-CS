The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Taslima return plea falls on deaf ears of rivals
                                                                                                               Taslima return plea falls on deaf ears of rivals
  - Desperate to come back home to Calcutta, author in exile writes to both Buddha and Mamata          MOHUA DAS                          Taslima: living everywhere is her Gmail chat status update                                        
	What is common between Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Mamata Banerjee? Their refusal to respond to Taslima Nasrins plea for help.        
	The Bangladeshi author in exile petitioned both the chief minister of Bengal and the apparent chief minister in waiting before leaving for New York last week. I wrote a letter to the CM and Mamata Banerjee but nobody replied, Taslima said in an email to Metro on Sunday.        
	In her two-page letter to Bhattacharjee and one-page missive to Banerjee she sought their attention and intervention so that she could return to her home in Calcutta. To both, she has pleaded as a Bengali in distress, adding a womans touch to one and an ideological twist to the other.        
	 Whatever happens, come what may, I will always want to live in Calcutta.... That was my one and only home, she said in her email to Metro. Responding to a question on whether she had in any way been made to feel welcome to return to Calcutta, the writer on the run wrote: Yes, by ordinary people in Calcutta.        
	That, of course, rules out Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Mamata Banerjee. There was no comment from the CPM camp on this matter but a Trinamul leader said on Monday that Mamata would only decide what to do about Taslimas comeback plea after discussing the matter with Pranab Mukherjee.        
	Taslima, who was in Delhi earlier this month for the renewal of her Indian visa, made a quiet exit to New York on August 27, two days after her 47th birthday. But not before penning letters to the two political heavyweights of Bengal.        
	Hailing Mamata as an inspiration for crores of women, she wrote: There is no land to which I belong anymore. Im wandering around the world like an orphan.... Why should a Bengali be deprived of stepping on to her own land? I would forever be grateful to you if you help me realise my dreams of living in Bengal once again.        
	To Mamatas arch rival, she wrote: I never thought Id be deprived of the kind of support Ive always received from you. I believed that we shared the same ideologies.... Not even in my worst nightmare had I imagined that I would have to leave Calcutta.... Please dont deprive a Bengali from her air, water, language and culture.... I miss my house, the writing room, books and all other important things.... Please grant me permission to live in Calcutta. Please allow me to live.        
	What the author pursuing a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship on democracy and secularism, misses the most is her pet cat Minu, now in Dhaka. She tells Metro: I miss her terribly, every minute. I cry for Minu, my daughter. My home is gone with the wind. Minu is far away struggling to survive.... For what crime are we being punished?        
	Neither Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee nor Mamata Banerjee seems to have an answer.

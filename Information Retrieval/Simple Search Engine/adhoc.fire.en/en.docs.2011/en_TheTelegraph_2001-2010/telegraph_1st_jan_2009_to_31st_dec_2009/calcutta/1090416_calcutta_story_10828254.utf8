                                                                                                               Tourists attacked in Sikkim
          OUR CORRESPONDENT IN GANGTOK                              
	A group of tourists from Calcutta had a frightening experience in north Sikkim on Monday, when two drunk residents assaulted one of their drivers and smashed the window panes of their vehicles.        
	The group from Baranagar alleged that the duo and a third Sikkimese were travelling in a car that sported a flag similar to that of the ruling Sikkim Democratic Front.        
	No one was injured. A police complaint has been lodged with Lachung police station.        
	The tourists  14 adults and seven children, all relatives  had arrived in Gangtok on Sunday afternoon. The next day, they set off for Lachung in north Sikkim where they had planned to spend the night before heading for Yumthang valley.         
	We were travelling in two vehicles. Around 7pm, when we were just 2km short of Lachung, a jeep screeched to a halt in front of one of our vehicles, recalled Kripasindhu Nath, a member of the tourist party.        
	The three men in the jeep shouted at our driver to back off. Our vehicles started moving backward but the jeep kept pushing us towards the edge of the road. As the driver of one of our vehicles protested, two men, both drunk, got off the jeep and started beating him up, Nath said.        
	When the tourists protested, the duo started smashing the glass panes of the two vehicles with machetes.        
	The women and the children were screaming as the duo kept attacking our cars. We shouted in Hindi that we were tourists but that did not make them relent. The gang drove away after five minutes, Nath recounted.         
	The tourists then reached Lachung, where the local sarpanch met them at their hotel and apologised for the incident. He assured us that we would be safe in Lachung, said Nath. The group returned to Gangtok on Tuesday.        
	The senior superintendent of police (North Sikkim), B.K. Tamang, said a probe had been ordered. An officer described the incident as a drunken brawl between the drivers and the men in the jeep, claiming the tourists were not the target.        
	The Sikkim Hotel and Restaurant Association condemned the incident and demanded action against the guilty.

                      Chronicle of the bards music                    Much of what Tagore experienced in life  his frustration with the Indian freedom movement, grief and despair with premature deaths in the family, a sense of devastation after the woman he loved committed suicide  found poignant expression in his songs and lyrics. Written by Reba Som, Rabindranath Tagore: The Singer and his Song chronologically maps the musical journey of Tagore with anecdotes, allusions and translations from Bengali of long discourses on music of his era. The book has picture illustrations of personalities relevant to this story, of his paintings that have been linked to his music and the translation and transliteration of 60 songs contextualised in the text. As part of a special limited edition offer, it also includes in its jacket a compact disc with a selection of 45 of these songs from Saregama albums. This evening, Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi will launch the book, to be followed by the rendition of Tagore songs by the author, who is also an accomplished Rabindrasangeet singer. What distinguishes this book from any other on Tagores works, is the fact that Som has combined her skills as a singer as well as a trained historian to produce this book, never before attempted in the English language. The evenings programme also features a discussion on the book by Dr Rajat Kanta Ray and Dr Sabyasachi Bhattacharya, and will conclude with the screening of the documentary, The Story of Gitanjali.

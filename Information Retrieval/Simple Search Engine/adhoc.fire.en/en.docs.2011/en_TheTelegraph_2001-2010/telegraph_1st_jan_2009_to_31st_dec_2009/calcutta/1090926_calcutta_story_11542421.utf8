The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Priyanka provides Puja break
                                                                                                               Priyanka provides Puja break
          PRIYANKA ROY                              
	Pandal-hopping, Puja and Priyanka Chopra.        
	Bolly-crazy Calcutta thronged the plexes to spend three hours and 31 minutes of their Saptami watching 12 Priyankas in Whats Your Raashee?        
	Calcuttans, especially the younger lot, maintain a tradition of watching films during Puja. Whats Your Raashee? is a young film from a big banner with big stars and the promos have generated interest, said Virendra Marya, the regional director of INOX which notched up one houseful show after another on Friday at its three properties.        
	The Ashutosh Gowariker romantic comedy starring ex-flames Priyanka and Hurman Baweja, with 14 plots and 13 songs, has been panned by pundits for being tediously long. But the first-day-second-show Calcuttan didnt seem to mind.        
	I was looking forward to Whats Your Raashee? and wanted to watch it on the first day itself. The first half was good, but the second half seemed too long. However, I think it was a Saptami afternoon well spent, said Anirban Chatterjee, a school student at INOX (Forum).        
	There was no missing the festive filmi mood at the Fame addresses. Almost all the shows on Saptami went houseful and we are already confident of running the film to packed houses on the remaining three days of Puja, said a Fame Cinemas official.         
	UTV Motion Pictures, the producers of the film, were quick to raise a toast to the Bolly fan in Calcutta. Despite the three hour-plus running time and the fact that people have the option to go pandal-hopping or eat out, Whats Your Raashee? has had a resounding opening in all Calcutta multiplexes. Advance bookings for the weekend are very healthy and the queues are growing, said associate vice-president Girish Johar.         
	Whats Your Raashee? may be the flavour of the festive weekend but one-week wonders Dil Bole Hadippa! and Wanted are also benefiting from a Puja surge.        
	I would rather spend the Puja days watching films at the plexes than braving it out in a crowded pandal, said businessman Rajeev Chawla.

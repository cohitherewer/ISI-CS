The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | That stagey feeling
                                                                                                               Stage      That stagey feeling
										                        A still from Ganashatru				                           
	Harold Pinters plays The Caretaker and The Birthday Party came to the city last week. Those who had got to see the foreign stage production of Birthday Party in Calcutta some four decades ago may remember the sound of seagulls; some others will recall Ajitesh Bandyopadhyays Bengali version Tetrishtomo Jonmodin. But now they could feel the emptiness in the visuals of the row of empty beach chairs, their cloth fluttering in the salty breeze, against the expanse of sky. Because this Birthday Party was a screen version, part of a package of Pinter films titled A Pause for Pinter, at the Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre.        
	Accident and The Servant, the other two films screened, were not based on Pinters plays but had screenplays written by him.         
	It was Pinters love and understanding of the film medium that make The Birthday Party and The Caretaker such successes. As Shamik Bandyopadhyay pointed out in his introduction, both films kept close to the plays, but then the plays date from a time when Pinter was mad about cinema, watching films by Eisenstein to Orson Welles to the French Surrealists. So his writing was closer to films, dialogues were not theatrical, and characters didnt bother to explain themselves.         
	The language of film helped to push the realism of the plays further. The camera angles and sound accentuated the human vulnerability. Claustrophobia and total silence  impossible in auditoriums  are palpable here.         
	Countless other masterly films enrich and extend the scope of playscripts. Throne of Blood was based on Macbeth; Sleuth, A Streetcar Named Desire and 12 Angry Men are other plays adapted to film.        
	India can boast of only a few. One of the first new wave films in India was Shantata Court Chalu Aahe, a Marathi film directed by Satyadev Dubey with debutantes Amrish Puri and Amol Palekar from Vijay Tendulkars play. Govind Nihalanis Party (Mahesh Elkunchwar wrote the screenplay from his own play), Gulzars Angoor (A Midsummer Nights Dream), Ketan Mehtas Holi (another Elkunchwar play) and more recently Vishal Bharadwajs Maqbool and Omkara (adaptations of Macbeth and Othello respectively) are some others.         
	In Bengali there is Satyajit Rays Ganashatru (on Ibsens Enemy of the People) and Tapan Sinhas Banchharamer Bagaan (on Manoj Mitras Sajano Bagaan). Though Bengali films from plays have been in the making since the 1950s it is not always possible to recognise any difference in the language or treatment as in Tagores Visarjan or Chirokumar Sabha.         
	The verbal language overwhelms the visual in these films as the films use the same dialogues of the plays, meant to grip the audience or explain things one cannot show on stage. Perhaps it was because film actors, directors and technicians of the time came mostly from the stage or perhaps it was simply the Bengali directors love for theatre  but plays here have rarely translated into cinematic language.       SEBANTI SARKAR

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hunt for arms buyer
                                                                                                               Hunt for arms buyer
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The arms haul in Baguiati led cops to a East Midnapore village in search of a Trinamul leader, Nandadulal Maity, who had allegedly procured arms from the racket.        
	But the cops had to return empty-handed as Maity was neither at home in Bhajachauli, near Patashpur, nor in another house in nearby Kanakpur, which the cops claimed was his hideout.         
	The police said Maity had been absconding since the arrest of Ashok Mandal, a key operative of the racket, and six others in Malda early on Sunday.         
	Maity had been purchasing arms from Mandal since 2002, said a CID officer investigating the case. We are also looking for two other Patashpur residents, Dibakar and Gobindo. Nimai Das, the kingpin of the arms racket unearthed last Sunday, is still absconding.        
	Senior officers on Friday inspected the arms seized from the Baguiati house.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Streetcar named desire
                                                                                                               Streetcar named desire
										                        
	A citys identity, not to speak of its look, is often known by the public transport that plies on its roads. London is known for its red double-decker bus and black cab. Calcutta had those buses too  and people and environment-friendly trams, which are almost extinct. Before private buses with their tacky exteriors and tin-can insides overran the citys roads, Calcuttas transport didnt make for the ugly sight that it does now. Minibuses and autorickshaws, unknown in civilised cities, have piled ugliness upon ugliness. Some days ago, the state announced purchase of 25 new buses. Before that a few new trams hit the streets. But, as with Calcuttas accidental birth and even more disastrously accidental growth, there is no method in the madness. Its not so hard to marry one mode of transport to another  even in their appearance. Metro tries to do just that but it experiments only with buses, trams and taxis. For two reasons. One, it believes  as many traffic planners do  that minibuses and autorickshaws are one huge historic blunder, to borrow the words of the CPM patriarch, Jyoti Basu, and should be taken off the road. Second, though Metro rail should logically be a part of the four-armed system sharing its looks with those of the other three, it is administered by an authority separate from the state government  and we didnt want to be overambitious. As it is, going by experience, it is too much to expect the administration to embrace the idea. Then again no one ever thought apolitical campaigns would grow so strong as to force the authorities to try and protect the Maidan or to make autorickshaws change to gas  though neither battle is fully won yet. The hope, therefore, is to strike a resonance within the four walls of Writers Buildings and, more important, in the minds of the citizens. In the models of buses and taxis, where we have stuck with the Ambassador because changing the car itself may be too tall an order, it will not be mentioned each time that the fuel will be gas because that is assumed. All public transport should run on gas, as in Delhi. A new beginning is very much possible with the court ordering vehicles over 15 years of age off the road.

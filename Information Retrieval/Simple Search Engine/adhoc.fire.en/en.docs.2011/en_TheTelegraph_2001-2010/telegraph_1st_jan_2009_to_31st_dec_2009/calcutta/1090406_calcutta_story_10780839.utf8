The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rally bane of green lungs 
                                                                                                               Rally bane of green lungs 
										      tt for city: save the maidan                        
	The army, as custodians of the Maidan, has taken a significant step by submitting a report in court stating that the DYFI should not hold another rally on the citys lungs because its supporters mauled the greens and failed to rectify the damage.        
	Since Metro started the campaign to save the Maidan from political clutches, emails have been flooding our inbox. Here are a few:              
	I strongly support a ban on rallies on the Maidan. The gentle breeze and greenery cannot be destroyed for the sake of political rallies. The action taken by the army by not issuing a cleanliness certificate to the DYFI and withholding the security deposit of Rs 20,000 is necessary but not sufficient. Cancellation of the DYFIs organisational status for violating the court order is essential.        
	Asok Kumar Chatterjee, Konnagar              
	If the Book Fair cannot be held on the Maidan to prevent pollution, how can political rallies be allowed there? Those who attend the rallies cook on the greens, dig up the ground and trample it. Saving the Maidan is not just the responsibility of ordinary citizens but also the parties that organise the rallies. But no warning or penalty works because they do not care about the environment. So a blanket ban on rallies on the Maidan is a must.         
	Amrita Mallik,Salt Lake        
	The Maidan should be converted into a big park and trees should be planted there to keep it out of bounds for political melas. This will make the greens beautiful and healthy. Years back, there used to be a good-looking earthen hillock covered in greenery in the south-eastern corner of the Maidan.        
	Pijush Banerjee,Biren Roy Road (West)        
	Every single square inch of green matters in the wasteland we call Calcutta. In contrast, Delhi has become more liveable because of the growth in its green cover in the past 20 years. I protest the attack on the city greens, be it the Maidan, the Lake or East Calcutta Wetlands. Down with ignorant politicians and their convenient half-truths.        
	Debarya Banerjee              
	I support a ban on all sort of rallies on the Maidan. The green patch is trying desperately to survive in Calcutta. The sight of the diminishing wetlands and greens in and around the city makes me cringe. When will the politicians and the people realise how important greenery is? I am afraid it may be too late already!

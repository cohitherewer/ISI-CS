The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Criminal case for gate block
                                                                                                               Criminal case for gate block
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                              
	The city civic authorities, following in the footsteps of the state government, have made blocking office gates a criminal offence.        
	Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay issued a circular last month informing the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) employees and trade unions that those who would agitate by preventing others from entering or leaving office would face criminal charges.         
	The circular also makes it mandatory for trade union leaders to seek an appointment to meet a senior official.        
	Last September, former chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb had issued a circular which made blocking government office gates during working hours a criminal offence.        
	FIRs have been lodged with Hare Street police station and departmental proceedings have been started against three employees for flouting the circular, said a joint secretary in the home department.        
	An assault on a borough executive engineer by trade union supporters prompted the CMC circular, said sources.        
	Civic trade union leaders have demanded that the circular be withdrawn. Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya ruled out a rollback. Flouting service rules cannot be a trade union right.         
	Sovandeb Chattopadhyay, an Indian National Trinamul Trade Union Congress leader, described the circular as an attack on trade union rights.        
	Citu leader Amalendu Bhattacharaya said: Appointments with civic authorities must be given within 10 days.

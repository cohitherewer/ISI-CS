                      Future talents of Bengal art                    The recent boom in the Indian art scene has brought fame and fortune to artists of the contemporary era. With buyers across the country and offshore having already collected their works, discerning art lovers are now setting their sights on the future. Keeping in sync with current demands in the art market, Horizon, the ongoing group exhibition of paintings, showcases the works of 11 promising artists of Bengal, providing them a platform through which they can win the attention of connoisseurs as well as extend and enrich their limits of expression. The themes dealt with are very unlike one another, as are their treatment, reflecting a wide disparity and diversity in the individual styles of the artists. While Jonaki Pal and Polly Das specialise in abstract and bright works, Arup Lodh and Supriyo Das portray realistic human visages. Also participating are Sarbani Ganguly, Joydeep Chatterjee, Bharat Das, Dipankar Chanda, Susanta Chowdhury, Soumya Kishore Chakraborty and Subir Dey.

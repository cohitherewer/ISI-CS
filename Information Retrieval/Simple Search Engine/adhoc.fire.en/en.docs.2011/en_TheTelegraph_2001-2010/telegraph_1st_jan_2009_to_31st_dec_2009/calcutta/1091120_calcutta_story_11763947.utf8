The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | City air: from foul to critical   Revised norms highlight violation
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      City air: from foul to critical     Revised norms highlight violation
          JAYANTA BASU                                                  
	Calcutta began the week as a polluted city but will end it as a critically polluted city.        
	The new standards for air quality announced by the environment ministry on Wednesday have pushed Calcutta firmly into the hall of shame, with the toxic count of at least two major pollutants being 1.5 times higher than the permissible limit.        
	Preliminary figures for 2008-09 peg the citys respirable particulate matter or PM 10 at 90 micrograms per cubic metre (upper limit 60) and the oxides of nitrogen at 65 (upper limit 40).        
	Going by the green book, a city is bestowed critical status when on crucial polluting counts it is 1.5 times above the maximum permissible limit, a line that Calcuttas vile air vaults quite easily.        
	What that means is that the air we are forced to breathe is the biggest cause of diseases ranging from respiratory distress to cancer.        
	Calcutta has definitely become a critically polluted city with reference to the new standards. What is significant is the simultaneous shooting up of PM 10 and Nox (oxides of nitrogen) levels, as both are linked to automobile emission, said Anumita Roychoudhury of the Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).        
	Tailpipe emission is the prime culprit for the toxic count of respirable particulate matter, oxides of nitrogen and also benzene (which is around seven times higher than the limit) in Calcuttas air. How badly polluting buses, taxis, trucks and autorickshaws are vitiating the air is evident from the data at the 18 pollution control board-operated sampling points (see chart).        
	Repeated court prods have finally forced the government to start at least talking tough after 16 months of hem and haw (see story right).        
	The government and the Opposition are equally to blame for the foul air we breathe. Both are too busy pampering the transport lobby to bother about the citys lungs, said a green activist.        
	If the PM 10 violation wasnt bad enough, the revised norms have introduced PM 2.5  the fine particulate matter that enter the respiratory tract and damage the lungs  making the citys foul-air reality even more stark.        
	A pollution control board study in 2002-04 had concluded that around two-third of the citys respirable particulate matter would fall under the PM 2.5 category, especially in areas where vehicular congestion was high. That would explain the nagging cough, the wheezing and cardiac trouble.        
	But as minister Jairam Ramesh pointed out on Wednesday, the big question would be the enforcement of standards. And on that count, Calcuttas track record has been abysmal.        
	Environment activist Subhas Dutta terms the new standards a mockery as they are not backed by a legally binding roadmap for implementation. Another environmentalist, though, found virtue in the stringent norms as they would increase the humiliation factor of the government.

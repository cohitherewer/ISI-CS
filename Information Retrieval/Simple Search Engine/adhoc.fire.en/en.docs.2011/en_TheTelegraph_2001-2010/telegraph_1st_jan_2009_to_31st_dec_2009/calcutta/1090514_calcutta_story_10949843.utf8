  actress
  Polling booth: Rajendra Shiksha Sadan, Rajendra Pratap Colony        
	Why havent you voted before?
  I didnt have a voter identity card.        
	Why vote this time?
  This year, I was assured that I could vote without the voter ID card as long as I carried either my PAN card or passport.        
	When did you vote and why?
  Around 2pm; I wanted to vote at a time when it would be less crowded.        
	What did you carry?
  My passport, ration card and PAN card.        
	What did people say when they saw you?
  As I entered, people started nudging each other saying Oi dekh Swastika. There were some murmurs and ripples. There were also some who were irritated at the media attention I was attracting.        
	How long did you stand in queue?
  Not more than five minutes!        
	How did you find the security cover?
  Very good. There were lots of cops around guiding everyone and keeping a strict vigil.        
	Do you want to change anything about the voting process?
  No, not really. But I think the EVM enclosures should be more secluded.        
	What was the mood like?
  Rather pleasant; there were many youngsters, housewives and lots of girls.        
	Will you vote again?
  Of course. I feel its our right and we should not waste it. Each vote matters.

  Because I was under 18.

  Polling booth: Jogesh Mime Academy        
	Why havent you voted before?
  I was out of town during the last election.

  Five minutes.        
	How did you find the security cover?
  Very good.        
	Was there any trouble? 
  A woman carrying her PAN card instead of the voter ID card was turned away.        
	Do you want to change anything about the process?
  The system of checking names in the polling booth should be computerised. Besides, the quality of the ink put on the finger was bad. Also, the people at the booth seemed to be clueless.        
	What was the mood like? 
  Casual. CPM and Trinamul Congress supporters were joking with one other and sharing Monginis pastries from a packet!        
	Will you vote again?
  Yes.          
	RESSHMI GHOSH

	Was there anybody at hand to help a first-time voter?
  Yes, the officers inside the room guided me.        
	Was the mood forbidding/fun?
  I think it was fun. There were lots of young people and everyone was very chilled out.        
	Did anyone ask for your autograph?
  No, but there were whispers after I arrived.        
	Will you vote again?
  Only if I see that there is a change in the system.

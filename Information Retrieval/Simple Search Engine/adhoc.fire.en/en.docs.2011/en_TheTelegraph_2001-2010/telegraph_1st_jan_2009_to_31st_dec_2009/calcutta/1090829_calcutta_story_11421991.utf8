The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Stem cell unit at city hospital
                                                                                                               Stem cell unit at city hospital
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Medical College and Hospital on Friday announced the launch of its stem cell transplant unit after a successful transplant on a cancer patient.        
	Manowara Bibi, 36, a resident of Ayas village in Birbhum, is suffering from multiple myeloma, a cancer of plasma cells which produce antibodies. Doctors at the Institute of Haematology and Transfusion Medicine at Medical College said the disease required high doses of chemotherapy, which destroyed the immune system. The survival rate of such patients is very low, they added.        
	The doctors performed autologous stem cell transplant  where stem cells are collected from a patients blood before chemotherapy and administered back into the body after chemotherapy.        
	After this process, a patient of multiple myeloma can survive up to seven years, on an average, said Prantar Chakraborty, an assistant professor at the institute, who performed the transplant along with institute director Utpal Chowdhury and others.         
	Manowaras blood count had gone down to zero after chemotherapy but has returned to normal now, said Chakraborty. She is recovering in a barrier room, specially designed for housing such patients.

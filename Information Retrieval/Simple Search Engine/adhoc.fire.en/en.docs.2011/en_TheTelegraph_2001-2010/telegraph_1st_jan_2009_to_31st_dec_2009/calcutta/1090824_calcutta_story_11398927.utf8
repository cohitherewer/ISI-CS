The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Schoolgirl relives horror ride
                                                                                                               Schoolgirl relives horror ride

	Five days after three youths teased a pool car full of schoolgirls at Metiabruz and then shot at its driver for protesting, they are finally behind bars.        
	Mohammad Irfan, alias Sonu, 20, and Mohammed Shamim, alias Shadab, 22, were arrested on Saturday while Raju, 21, was picked up on Sunday morning.        
	Raju was involved in a motor theft racket while his two accomplices worked in a local garage. Police said Irfan was riding the bike and had shot Vinod Kumar Jaiswara in the chest. The pool car driver, who was discharged from SSKM Hospital on Saturday, will be given a police bravery award.        
	The arrests will help calm the nerves of the girls at Keshoram Cotton Mills High School on Garden Reach Road, who are struggling to live down the horror of last Tuesday morning. Some of them are yet to return to school. Those who have are trying their best to overcome their trauma.        
	Metro met one of them, a student of Class X on Saturday morning. This is her first-person account.                
	Around 6.05am last Tuesday, I was waiting at Bandabattala in Garden Reach for the pool car to go to school. How was I to know that what seemed like a normal day would end up being so terrifying, a day I will never forget?        
	Two of my friends, who are in Class IX, joined me and started telling me how three young men on a bike had offered them a lift to school. My friends had quickly walked away from them.        
	As they were telling me this, our pool car (a white Tata Sumo) arrived and we boarded it. One of my friends and I sat in the front seat, while the others sat in the back.        
	We told Bhaiya (the girls address the pool car driver as Bhaiya) what had happened. We did not pay much attention to the incident as local boys have a habit of teasing girls.         
	I started collecting the fare (Rs 3) from the other girls and our Maam (a teacher of the school was in the car), to hand it over to Bhaiya. Since I collect the fare everyday, Bhaiya calls me conductor!        
	But soon, one of the girls noticed the bikers following our car and alerted Bhaiya. As the bikers drew close, Bhaiya started speeding away.        
	When they kept chasing us, Bhaiya slammed the brakes near a school in Mudiali. The bike collided with our car and Bhaiya got out of the car.        
	Angry words were exchanged before Bhaiya returned to the wheel and started driving fast.        
	We all sat tense and silent.        
	Bhaiya was trying to call somebody from his mobile, but he could not get through.        
	The bike had vanished. But suddenly near the site for Metiabruz College, the bikers turned up in front of the car forcing us to a halt.        
	What happened after that seems unreal even today.

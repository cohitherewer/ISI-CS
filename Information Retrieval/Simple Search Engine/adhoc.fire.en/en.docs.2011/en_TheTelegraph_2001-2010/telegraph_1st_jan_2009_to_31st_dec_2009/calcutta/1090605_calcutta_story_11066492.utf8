                      Art of social realism                    Certainly one of the finest watercolour artists that India has ever produced, Shyamal Dutta Ray has left behind an awesome, incomparable legacy for generations of art lovers to treasure and uphold. Having begun his career with painting landscapes, he shifted to the figurative form of expression in later years. Often compared to British painter Joseph Turner in terms of his technique, Dutta Rays works may rightly be regarded as the poetry of social reality. His works express the trials and travails of the common man, as well as his follies and foibles, through washes and transparent colours. The recurrence of skeletal figures in his paintings and his famous Broken Bowl series can be attributed to his having witnessed the Great Bengal Famine on the one hand and being aware of the rising crescendo of economic aggression on the other. Yet, he was far from being hemmed in by physical, human boundaries and thus, continued to paint images of love and peace alongside those of social degradation. His final works bear the stamp of hope, reflecting the fact that he had successfully resolved his inner turmoils regarding socio-political upheavals. The ongoing show, being hosted to mark his 75th birth anniversary, features the Bothra familys collection of works by the master. Also featuring works by Sandip Roy and Subir Dey, recipients of Shyamal Dutta Ray award given by SCA and Ila Dutta Ray.                  lEvent: An exhibition of paintings by Shyamal Dutta Roy, along with works by Sandip Roy and Subir Dey lWhen: Till June 9; 2 pm - 7 pm lWhere: Akar Prakar, P 238 Hindustan Park

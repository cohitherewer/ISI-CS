	Criminals have allegedly joined hands with police to turn a 350m stretch of busy Karl Marx Sarani, outside Fancy and Five Star markets, into an illegal parking lot.        
	The racket charges more than five times the normal fee to allow vehicles to park in the middle of the road, which is a no-parking zone.        
	The practice not only poses a mishap risk to motorists but also pedestrians, who are forced to share the carriageway with vehicles since the footpaths are taken up by hawkers.         
	When Metro visited the area, 50 vehicles, including a few beacon-fitted cars, were parked in the middle of the road between Babubazar and Fancy and Five Star markets. Buses and trams plied on both sides of the vehicles.        
	The parking fee is Rs 7 per hour across the city but we have to shell out Rs 35 an hour to criminals who manage the this illegal parking lot, said Arun Singh, an Alipore resident who was visiting the markets along with his wife and two kids. Harassment is as much a problem as extortion. The parking lot guys become abusive if you ask for a receipt. It is embarrassing, said another visitor.        
	Metro saw five men, clad in T-shirt and shorts, collecting money from those parking in the middle of the road. The five were writing down the numbers of the parked vehicles in a register and speaking to two cops posted on the stretch.        
	Policemen get a percentage of the amount collected in a day. Its all happening with the consent of some officers of the local police station, alleged a resident. He recounted a number of fatal accidents on the stretch in the past year.        
	Deputy commissioner (traffic) Dilip Banerjee admitted a parking racket was operating in the area but denied involvement of the traffic police. An officer of the Port division promised to look into the matter.

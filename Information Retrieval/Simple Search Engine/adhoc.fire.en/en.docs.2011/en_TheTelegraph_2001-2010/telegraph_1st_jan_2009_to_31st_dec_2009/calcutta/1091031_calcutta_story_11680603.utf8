The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Protest forces Buddha detour
                                                                                                               Protest forces Buddha detour
  - Cops Caught off guard          A STAFF REPORTER                           Cops grapple with protesters as the chief ministers car (circled in red) moves down the other flank of the road                                         
	A group of PTTI protesters flung themselves on the path of the chief ministers convoy near Writers Buildings on Friday afternoon, forcing a quick diversion.         
	Former and current students of primary teachers training institutes (PTTIs) have been agitating for jobs in government schools.        
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was moving down BBD Road (East) around 1.15pm on the way to his Palm Avenue home for lunch when about a dozen of the 30-odd protesters sprang onto the carriageway.         
	The driver of the pilot car slammed the brakes and waited a few minutes as cops jostled with the youths on the road before turning around and leading the convoy down the other flank of the one-way road.        
	Senior police officers could not recall another instance of agitators managing to stop the chief ministers convoy and admitted that they were not aware of the protest plan. The Special Branch is supposed to collect such information.        
	Joint commissioner (headquarters) Jawed Shamim, however, claimed: Snap demonstrations take place outside Writers Buildings. There was no diversion. The convoy just went back and took the other side of the road.        
	State home secretary Ardhendu Sen was not ready to buy this explanation and ordered an inquiry into the incident. The police commissioner has been asked to submit a report. It must be considered a lapse on the part of the police though its difficult to keep a watch at every point. I shall also talk to director (security) A.K. Maliwal, he said.        
	The chief minister had said he would meet us after returning from Delhi but he didnt. Even Partha De (education minister) didnt meet us. We were left with no option, said Ashok Rudra, the secretary of the PTTI students union that organised the protest.        
	Nineteen protesters were arrested and released on bail.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Nirupam to review fair 
                                                                                                               Nirupam to review fair 
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The fire department refused a provisional no-objection certificate to Calcutta Book Fair again on Friday, the fourth day of the fair. A government team, led by industries minister Nirupam Sen, will visit Milan Mela on Saturday to take stock of the fair infrastructure.        
	Certain inadequacies need to be addressed before a provisional certificate is granted, a fire department official said.        
	Fire officers met the fair organisers during the day and suggested some safety measures, including use of fire-retardant underground cables and fire-retardant materials for covering stalls.        
	Another problem is the entry of fire tenders. The makeshift roads at the fair cant bear the weight of a fire tender, a fire officer said. The water supply facilities, too, are not in place, he added.

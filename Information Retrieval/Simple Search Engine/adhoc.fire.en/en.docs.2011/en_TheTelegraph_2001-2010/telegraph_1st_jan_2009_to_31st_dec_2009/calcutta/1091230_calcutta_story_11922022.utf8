The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bag, items missing on flight
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Bag, items missing on flight
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A family flying from New York to Calcutta on Air India alleged that clothes and a few other items were missing from one of their six bags that arrived several days late. The family was carrying one more bag which is yet to be traced.        
	Another family flying the same airline on the route also alleged that their baggage had arrived late.        
	Bidyut Ghosh, a scientist with Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, US, had arrived in the city with his family on December 25.        
	We were carrying seven bags but were told that none arrived. The airline tracked down the baggage and handed it over to me at the airport on Monday. But on returning home to Phoolbagan, we found that the lock of a bag was broken. Clothes and some other items inside were missing. Besides, we are yet to get one more piece of the luggage, said Ghosh.        
	The other family arrived in the city on December 19. After landing at Calcutta we were told that not one of our eight bags had arrived, said Kalidas Paul, who has put up in a hotel in the city. One of the bags contained my medicines, added Paul, a cardiac patient.        
	The family members said they repeatedly tried to approach the claims department of the airline but the calls went unanswered. I received two bags a few days later and the rest yesterday, recalled Paul, who works in a college in Washington.        
	Air India officials said Ghoshs baggage went missing because the airline which operated the connecting flight from Washington to New York did not bring it. As for the missing items, he said: We will look into the matter if a complaint is lodged. About Pauls baggage, the official said: Several flights are getting cancelled in the US because of bad weather. This is often leading to baggage problems.

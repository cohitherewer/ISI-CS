The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pen-pistol politics
                                                                                                               Pen-pistol politics
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two pen-pistols had been delivered to political leaders in Maoist-dominated pockets of West Midnapore from the Baguiati house where a huge cache of illegal arms and ammunition was seized on Sunday.        
	Ashok Mandal, an operative of the racket and one of the seven men arrested in a state guest house in Malda, gave CID officers a list of customers, said investigators.        
	The arrest led the sleuths to the Baguiati house.        
	Mandal told us that Nimai Das, a Group D employee of Rajarhat-Gopalpur municipality, had asked him to deliver the pen-pistols to the leaders. We havent obtained the names of the leaders, said an officer of the CIDs Special Operations Group.         
	The arms racket also had five or six regular customers in Calcutta and its adjoining areas. Das, who used to bring arms and ammunition to the city from Allahabad, has been absconding since the CIDs Malda raid.        
	His wife Bina claimed that she was in the dark about her husbands involvement in arms trade.        
	I only know that he used to broker land deals in his spare time, she said.        
	Neighbours described Das, an active member of a local club, as soft-spoken.        
	Das and Mandal also used to collect weapons from Rajesh, a resident of Nalanda, in Bihar. Rajesh died in a road accident a few days ago, said S.N. Gupta, the deputy inspector general (operations), CID.

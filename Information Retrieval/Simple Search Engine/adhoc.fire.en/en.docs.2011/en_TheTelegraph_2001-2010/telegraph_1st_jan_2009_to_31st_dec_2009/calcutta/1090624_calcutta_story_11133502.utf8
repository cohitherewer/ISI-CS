The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | State tightens criteria for management quota
                                                                                                               State tightens criteria for management quota
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                      
	The state government has decided on a tougher criteria for students seeking admission to private engineering colleges under the management quota this year.        
	An official in the higher education department said students must score at least 50 per cent in physics, chemistry and mathematics in the plus-II exams to qualify for admission under the quota.        
	They also have to rank within 60,000 in the state joint entrance examination or five lakh in the All India Engineering Entrance Examination.        
	Earlier, the students only needed to pass the plus-II exams and appear in the AIEEE or JEE.        
	The new criteria, the official said, would improve the standard of education in private engineering colleges. A review of the past few years records has revealed that some private institutions had admitted students who had scored very low marks in the board exams against a hefty payment. We will not let this continue.        
	Private engineering colleges are allowed to fill up 10 per cent of their seats through the management quota, the price for each seat varying between Rs 4 lakh and Rs 8 lakh.        
	Students admitted through the quota do not have to attend the counselling session organised by the state joint entrance board.        
	Siddhartha Dutta, the chairman of the state JEE board, has urged students and guardians to check the rules before applying for admission under the management quota.        
	Details of the admission procedure have been posted on the boards website. Students should check all details before approaching the colleges, said Dutta.        
	The joint entrance examination board will begin counselling for allotment of seats on July 5. The admission in the private engineering colleges will begin after counselling.

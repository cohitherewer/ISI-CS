	More than 50 people have complained to Lalbazar that they have lost lakhs after falling prey to fake text messages or emails.        
	An officer in Lalbazar said around 100 had lodged complaints alleging that they had received fake messages and emails which said they had won millions in dollar or pound in lucky draws. Of them, more than 50 have been duped of lakhs.        
	The complaints started pouring in following the arrest of two Nigerians on May 28. Sunanda Banerjee, a resident of Narkeldanga Main Road, said Obinwa and Ernest Uchenna Ughabugo had defrauded her of Rs 1.2 lakh. Banerjee, who had received a message which stated she had won $200,000, was asked to pay the money as processing fee.        
	A trader from Dum Dum gave away Rs 5.5 lakh after being told that he would receive a parcel containing 2,00000. An engineer from Kasba has lost Rs 1.36 lakh and a relative of an advocate lost Rs 2.5 lakh.

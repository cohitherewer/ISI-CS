The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Air France regulars skip a beat
                                                                                                               Air France regulars skip a beat
          SANJAY MANDAL                              
	The mid-Atlantic disappearance of the Air France flight on Monday sent a shiver up the spine of many international travellers in Calcutta. Not just because it was a plane crash, but also because it was an Air France crash.        
	For, the airline that does not touch down in town is tied to the heart, and purse, strings of many a Calcutta flier.        
	There are significant bookings on our Indian flights from Calcutta; almost as high as in some other metro cities, an Air France official said from Delhi.        
	What explains the citys love affair with an airline that has never considered Calcutta a suitable destination?        
	A combination of competitive rates, good frequent flier schemes, convenient connectivity and timetable, topped by nice service, say loyalists.        
	When I first heard the tragic news I couldnt believe it was an Air France flight, said city-based businessman Vikram Jairath, an Air France regular since 1993.        
	The airline has a well connected network in Europe. You arrive in Paris from Delhi early in the morning and get immediate connectivity to all European destinations, added Jairath, who has often flown the Paris-Rio de Janeiro route that proved fatal for 228 people on Monday.        
	According to the citys travel trade, nearly 10 per cent of the international fliers from the city book tickets on Air France.        
	The airline is extremely popular among corporate travellers from the city primarily because it has one of the best connectivities to Europe and South America along with the US, said Anil Punjabi, the chairman (east) of the Travel Agents Federation of India.        
	The recent merger with KLM Royal Dutch Airline has made the network even stronger, he added.        
	Exporter Arun Batra would agree. Since 1999, Batra has always taken an Air France flight on his business and leisure trips to Europe and the US. I have travelled over the Atlantic to the US on Air France several times and they have always been smooth flights, said Batra.        
	The nature of the crash  the Airbus A330-200 crashed into the Atlantic after hitting heavy turbulence, possibly a fierce tropical thunderstorm  left many Air France fliers in Calcutta shaken.        
	I wont fly Air France till they come out with proper reasons for the crash. I will not feel safe flying the airline till I am convinced there was nothing wrong with the craft, said Sundeep Bhutoria, an Air France frequent flier to Latin American countries because of good connectivity, a suitable schedule and, of course, the lure of Paris.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Four-day life of the killer
                                                                                                               Four-day life of the killer

	As the beast of screaming, spiralling winds loomed over Calcutta, meteorologist Devendra Pradhan suspected there would be some devastation, but the human toll has left him stunned.         
	Cyclone Aila wasnt the severest tropical storm that Pradhan has tracked through the Doppler weather radar in Calcutta, but its casualties are the closest he has witnessed from a weather event on his watch.         
	A tree with a really thick trunk crashed on a car and there were people trapped inside it, said Pradhan, the director of the India Meteorological Departments radar centre. People have died in the city [and elsewhere].         
	Three days ago, weather satellites had revealed the birth of what would soon be known as Aila. On May 22, it was a low pressure zone in the Bay of Bengal, feeding on the moisture from the sea warmed by summer temperatures. A day later, it transformed into a depression, a step closer to a cyclone. On Sunday, it graduated into a full-fledged cyclone, now closer to the Bengal coast.         
	At 5pm on Sunday, Pradhan and his colleagues began tracking the storm every 15 minutes. The weather radar told them the speed of the cyclone  about 20kmph to 25kmph, as well as the fury of its winds  between 80kmph and 100kmph.         
	In South 24-Parganas, district magistrate Khalil Ahmed received on Sunday an advisory originating from the IMD, New Delhi, cautioning that Aila with its wind speeds of about 60kmph to 80kmph would strike land at Sagar island on Monday.         
	But at 11am, the radar detected much higher wind speeds. Aila had postgraduated from a cyclone to a severe cyclone. Ahmed received another advisory this morning that he should expect speeds of 120kmph to 140kmph  within hours.         
	Some Bay of Bengal cyclones that approach south Bengal appear to take last-minute eastward twists and make their way towards Bangladesh. But Aila wasnt following that trend. The direction a cyclone takes depends on the steering currents high in the atmosphere, said a meteorologist.         
	During the monsoon season, cyclones may experience a tug of war. A monsoon trough pulls the cyclone northwest, while strong westerly winds would drive it eastward towards Bangladesh.         
	Today there was no prominent westerly wind, said the meteorologist on Monday.         
	Between noon and 1pm on Monday, the cyclone slammed into the coast at Sagar Island. At the time, the winds in its outer spiral bands were already lashing Calcutta, smashing window panes, uprooting trees and claiming lives.         
	As it moved over land, it lost its source of moisture and weakened. Within hours, it had diminished into a depression and, Pradhan said on Monday night, it was likely to dissipate within the next hour or two. The end of a killer.

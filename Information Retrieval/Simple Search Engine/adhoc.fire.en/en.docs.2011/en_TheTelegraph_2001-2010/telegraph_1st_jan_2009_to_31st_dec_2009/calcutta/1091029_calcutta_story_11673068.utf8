The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Schools slam billboard gore
                                                                                                               Schools slam billboard gore
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	A gory picture on a billboard put up by the CPM in front of its office on AJC Bose Road to protest political violence in the state has upset teachers and guardians of schools in the vicinity.        
	The parents say the billboard has left the children traumatised and they have urged the school authorities to approach the CPM leadership to get it removed.        
	The billboard, with the picture of a smashed head with eyes gouged out, has been put up opposite Pratt Memorial School and close to several other reputable schools such as St James, St Augustine, Frank Anthony and Albany Hall.        
	The image is so scary that my child shuts her eyes whenever she crosses the point on her way to school and back. The billboard has been put up in a way that passers-by cannot but notice it, said the angry father of a Class IV student of Pratt Memorial.        
	Psychologist Moharmala Chatterjee confirmed that pictures such as the one on the billboard could have a negative impact on young minds.        
	Such scary images can traumatise pre-school kids and drive teenagers towards pessimism. The images might come back to them as nightmare, said Chatterjee.        
	The head of a school who did not want to be named said parents had lodged similar complaints before the last Lok Sabha polls when the Trinamul Congress had plastered the city with pictures of the charred body of Tapasi Malik, who was allegedly raped and murdered during the Singur agitation.        
	An official of a school, located a few yards from the CPMs district committee office, said: Parents are urging us to request the ruling party to remove the gory image. We have to find a strategy to stop political parties from putting up such pictures in front of schools.        
	A teacher of another school said: We must protest against any form of violence but should be careful about choosing the medium. This does more harm than good, with children being assaulted by such a horrific sight.        
	SFIs state secretary Kaustav Chatterjee regretted that the billboard was having an adverse impact on schoolchildren. But one should keep in mind that about 150 of our supporters have been killed by our political rivals.... We have put up the billboard in the larger interests of society, he argued.

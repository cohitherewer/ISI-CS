The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Family waits for civic arm to rebuild house 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Family waits for civic arm to rebuild house 
          SUBHAJOY ROY                          Tapas Ghosh                                  
	A Behala house that was demolished six months ago after being damaged by a Calcutta Environmental Improvement Project (CEIP) sub-contractor has not yet been reconstructed.         
	Tapas Ghoshs two-storeyed house had developed cracks while Krita Engineering Pvt Ltd was laying sewage pipes under Biren Roy Road (West) as a part of the CEIP work.        
	According to an agreement between CEIP, a civic arm, and Engineering Project India Ltd, Krita is supposed to rebuild the damaged house. The sub-contractor completed the demolition in May but has not started the reconstruction because of funds problems.         
	The company found an accommodation for the family in the area and has been footing the rent bill.         
	My house was damaged barely a month after the pipe laying started in April last year. The agency shifted us to the rented house in December 2008, when the CEIP work was completed, said 55-year-old Ghosh, who is currently unemployed. He lives with his wife Shukla, 41, and 25-year-old son Raja.        
	We received a letter from Krita on March 13, 2009, informing us about the demolition. The house was levelled to the ground in two months, added Ghosh. The plot is now covered in overgrowth.        
	The estimated cost of reconstruction is Rs 14 lakh but the insurance company has agreed to pay Rs 10 lakh, said Shanti Nahata, who is looking after Kritas city projects.        
	The engineer on the civic panel who was engaged to estimate the cost of reconstruction said the work should have started months back. I completed the assessment nearly six months ago. Almost half the work should have been done by now, said T. Pahari, the engineer.        
	The CEIP authorities said procuring funds was the agencys responsibility. A copy of Ghoshs complaint about the delay in reconstruction had been forwarded to Engineering Project India, said a senior official of CEIP.

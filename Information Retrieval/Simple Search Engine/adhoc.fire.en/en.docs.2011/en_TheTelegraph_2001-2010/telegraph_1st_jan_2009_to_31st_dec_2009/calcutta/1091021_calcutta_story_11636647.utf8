The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Court scan on auto racket
                                                                                                               Court scan on auto racket
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Tuesday asked a senior police officer to probe whether an illegal autorickshaw permit racket was operating in the city in connivance with employees of the motor vehicles department.         
	Justice Dipankar Dutta asked the deputy commissioner (detective department) Damayanti Sen to submit a report by November 16.        
	The order followed a petition by Palm Avenue resident Ganesh Payek, who was refused a permit by the Beltola motor vehicles department but received a number of notices from the traffic police for violating traffic rules while driving his auto.        
	Payeks counsel Arun Maity had told the court on September 23 that his client had applied for an auto permit in 2003. Payek was asked to appear for an interview by motor vehicles officials in 2004 and pay Rs 10,000 as margin money.        
	Neither did my client deposit the amount nor was he issued any permit. But recently, he received two letters from the deputy commissioner (traffic) asking him to pay fines for violating traffic rules several times between June 2006 and September 2009, Maity said.        
	The lawyer said that when Payek was called for the interview, someone who identified himself as Rajesh Shaw had assured him that his friend Suresh Roy  who claimed to be the owner of a financial firm  would help him pay the margin money. We suspect Rajesh and Suresh, helped by some employees of the motor vehicles department, managed to obtain a permit in my clients name and sell it to someone else, Maity said.        
	Payek learnt from the motor vehicles department that a permit was issued in his name in 2005. My client approached one department after another in an attempt to get the permit cancelled but to no avail. The court should ask the authorities concerned to probe the matter, the lawyer said.        
	Maity later told Metro about a similar case he had filed in the high court recently. Fazle Rahaman, a neighbour of Payek, had applied for an auto permit in 2003 and he, too, was denied the document. But he received notices for 70 instances of road rule violation on different routes, Maity said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Parts better, whole as bad
                                                                                                               Parts better, whole as bad
                              A waterlogged city street. A Telegraph picture                            
	Will the monsoon, predicted to come in short spells because of climate change, bring as much waterlogging as last year?         
	Yes. It may be worse.         
	Officials of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and Calcutta Environment Improvement Programme (CEIP) are hoping that the situation will improve this year in parts, but overall it will be worse, they fear.         
	We have completed a significant part of drainage upgrade and the situation is expected to improve in Behala, Kashipur, Jadavpur and Garia. But we have to wait till the completion of the project in 2010 for the full impact, says Vivek Bharadwaj, project director of CEIP, an Asian Development Bank-funded initiative. He added that CEIP will undertake largescale desilting in the canal network in the East Calcutta Wetlands area after the monsoon.         
	Without proper desilting and enhancement of the canals capacity to carry drained water, drainage improvement efforts will come to nought. We have given permission to desilt the canals within the East Calcutta Wetlands, said M.L. Meena, the environment secretary and member secretary of the East Calcutta Wetlands management authority. CEIP will desilt canals from Dhapa Lock to Nalban and Topsia to Bantala, canals in the northern and southern basins of the East Calcutta Wetlands.         
	Funds from the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission are being used for upgrade in some other parts of the city. APC Road, parts of AJC Bose Road, Deshapriya Park area, Colootola and parts of Amherst Street are expected to have less waterlogging as we have desilted the big sewers in those areas with central funds. However there will be waterlogging in other areas after prolonged downpours, said Nilangsu Bose, the engineer-in-chief at CMC.         
	The situation will be worse than last year after heavy downpours because of the slow desilting, feels Debasish Kumar, councilor of ward 85, which includes the Deshapriya Park area. The drainage pumping stations are in extremely bad shape, too.                     JAYANTA BASU

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Roadblocks over fee hike
                                                                                                               Roadblocks over fee hike
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Around 200 parents of the students of three schools run by Christian missionaries blocked two roads on Tuesday afternoon, demanding that the fee hike be rolled back.        
	The parents said they blocked the Ekbalpore crossing and then National Library Avenue after the managements of Loyola High School, St Pauls School and St Teresas School failed to send any representative to a meeting they had called at Ekbalpore police station.        
	The parents claimed they had called the meeting in the presence of the police to discuss the possibility of a rollback. The managements of all three schools had assured us that they would send their representatives to the meeting. But when we reached the police station, there was no one from the schools, said a parent of a student of Loyola High School.        
	After waiting till 12.10pm, the 200-odd parents assembled at the Ekbalpore crossing and put up a blockade, disrupting traffic in the neighbourhood. The blockade was lifted after 15 minutes when police intervened.        
	The parents then moved to National Library Avenue, which they blocked for an hour.        
	Loyola High, St Pauls and St Teresas  all run by the Roman Catholic church under the Calcutta Diocese of Roman Catholic churches  have raised their fees by more than 60 per cent. The fees have been raised unilaterally and now the managements are unwilling to meet us, said a parent.        
	Father Moloy D Costa, the education inspector of the schools under the Calcutta diocese, said the three institutions had no information about the meeting at Ekbalpore police station.        
	A spokesman for Loyola High School said the parents had brought some outsiders to the meeting. We are ready to sit with the parents but will not speak to any outsider, said the official.

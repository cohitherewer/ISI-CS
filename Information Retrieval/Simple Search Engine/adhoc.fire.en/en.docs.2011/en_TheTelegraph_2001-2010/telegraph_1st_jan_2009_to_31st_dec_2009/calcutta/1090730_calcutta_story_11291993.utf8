                      For nature and wildlife                    In their ruthless frenzy to gain short-term material benefits, men are destroying nature and, in the process, endangering the lives of future generations on this planet. To generate awareness about this imminent danger, Jadavpur Viveknagar Nature Lovers Association has organised the ongoing 1st All India Salon and Exhibition on Nature and Wildlife Photography. Featuring a selection of 130 photographs, it comprises exhibits in several categories including mammals, birds, nature under threat, landscape, flora, insects, reptiles and invertebrates. Perhaps the biggest exhibition of its kind in Bengal, the show brings together works from Delhi, Mysore, Bangalore, Kerala and North Bengal, besides photographs by local lensmen. On show is a breathtaking array of colourful photographs that reveal the amazing wonders and beauties of the natural world. Shortlisted for this exhibition from a total of 550 entries, cash prizes have also been awarded to the three best exhibits of the show. A viewers choice award will also be declared on the final day.

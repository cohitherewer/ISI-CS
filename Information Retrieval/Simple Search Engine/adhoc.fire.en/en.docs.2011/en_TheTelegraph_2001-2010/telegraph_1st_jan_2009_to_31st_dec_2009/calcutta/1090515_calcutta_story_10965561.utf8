The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Schools left in a mess
                                                                                                               Schools left in a mess
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Betel stains on the floor of Modern High School for Girls. (Aranya Sen)                                  
	The Election Commission has left the schools it took over for polling stained and soiled, making a mockery of its clean-up commitment and forcing the managements to get the job done themselves.        
	The worst affected seems to be Modern High School for Girls on Syed Amir Ali Avenue. The seven rooms the poll panel had requisitioned were littered with cigarette ends, tobacco and food packets, empty water bottles and earthen cups on Thursday morning.         
	The desks were daubed with ink blotches and the walls and floors with betel stains. The adjacent footpath, too, was dirtied as the poll personnel spat out of the window, said S. Sengupta, the personnel officer of the school.         
	Its good that summer vacation has started, or else we might have had to suspend classes for today.        
	Principal Devi Kar, who learnt about the mess the poll brigade had left the school in on Thursday morning, ordered her staff to remove the garbage immediately. The stains will not go easily and we may have to paint the walls and the desks, she said.         
	Bengals chief electoral officer Debashis Sen would only say: The panel either asks decorators to clean up the premises or offers money to the schools for restoration. Several schools prefer to take the money and do the clean-up themselves.        
	Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School in Park Circus resembled a garbage dump, with banana peels, earthen cups and voting slips strewn across the compound.         
	N.C. Bhattacharya, in charge of the schools maintenance, said: The commission has not done any cleaning. It took us two hours to make the nine classrooms taken over by the panel fit for use.         
	We cant say no to the Election Commission but, unfortunately, the panel does not restore the school to its pre-poll condition, said principal Malini Bhagat.         
	At Patha Bhavan, the commission at least tried to make good its promise by paying the school staff to do the tidying-up. The commission paid Rs 150 to our sweeping staff to clean the compound, said Dipankar Sarkar, a senior teacher.        
	Sunirmal Chakravarthi, the principal of La Martiniere for Boys, said bits of paper and voting slips, and a few tobacco packets were littered around, but the mess was manageable compared with the last poll.

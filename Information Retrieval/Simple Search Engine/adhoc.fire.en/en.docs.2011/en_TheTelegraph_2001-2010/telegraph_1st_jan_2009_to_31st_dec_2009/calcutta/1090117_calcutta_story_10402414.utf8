                      A Bards devotion to his Muse                    What inspired the Bengal Bard to explore, create and express his myriad feelings and experiences in mellifluous words that flowed from his pen so spontaneously? The answers to Rabindranath Tagore life-long quest seem to come to him spontaneously, but if we look beyond his creations, they seem to be like the wail of a bruised soul. In his long, lonely sojourn, Tagore had but one friend, philosopher and guide: Kadambari Devi (Notun Bouthan)  his Muse, whom he fondly named Hecate. A lover of solitude, the Greek goddess Hecate was invisible, perhaps only glimpsed as a light, a will-o-the-wisp. Perhaps it was this luminous quality that marked Hecate as a moon goddess, and inspired Tagore to nickname her thus. However, her brief but intense attraction had completely taken over the adolescent poets entire being. Hence her death left him shattered and from here his other journey began. This was his metaphysical quest for the soul. The lady who had once inspired the young poet to write Vaishnav padavalis on Krishna and Radhas eternal love now became his vehicle of expressing Radhas pangs of separation from Krishna. His life-long devotion to something afar from the sphere of our sorrow became the leit motif of his entire gamut of creation, including his sketches and paintings. Janhabi presents an opera based on this theme. Conceived and compiled by Manoj Murali Nair and Madhuboni Chatterjee, the show features Manoj Murali Nair and Uttam Das Baul in songs, and Madhuboni Chatterjee in dance.

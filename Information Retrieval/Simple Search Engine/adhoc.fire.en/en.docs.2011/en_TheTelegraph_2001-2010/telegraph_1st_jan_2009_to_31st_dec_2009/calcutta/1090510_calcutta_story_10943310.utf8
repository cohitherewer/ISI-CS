The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Dilemma on Ray legacy
                                                                                                               Dilemma on Ray legacy
                                  
	Is there a Satyajit Ray legacy? Ray Society on May 6 at Birla Academy held a debate on the topic: Bengali cinema has forgotten the heritage of Ray. After two hours of argument, it was decided that Bengali cinema has, after all, not forgotten Rays heritage!         
	Scriptwriter Saibal Mitra, writer Sangita Banerjee, actress Bidipta Chakraborty and singer-journalist Anindya Chatterjee spoke for the motion, while author Tilottama Majumdar, film critic Ujjal Chakraborty, journalist Rajat Roychowdhury and actress Sudipta Chakraborty spoke against it. Dhritiman Chatterjee was the moderator.         
	Those for the motion felt that the times that Ray portrayed have changed. Bidipta Chakraborty said Ray was more of a conscience in Bengalis today. The speakers against the notion argued more powerfully about how Rays heritage lives on in the techniques of directors Aparna Sen and Rituparno Ghosh.               
	MUSIC, an organisation of music lovers, brought together some members of the original GooGa BaBa team to commemorate its 40th year at Bangla Akademi on May 2. It published a special edition of Bharshaphurti, a journal named after the celebration in Shundi that Goopy and Bagha attended. The edition has articles by Rays filmmaker son Sandip Ray, actor Tapen Chattopadhyay, singer Anup Ghoshal and Dulal Dutta, who edited the film, and includes photographs by Nemai Ghosh.        
	Sriyanta Chatterjee and Anasuya Basu

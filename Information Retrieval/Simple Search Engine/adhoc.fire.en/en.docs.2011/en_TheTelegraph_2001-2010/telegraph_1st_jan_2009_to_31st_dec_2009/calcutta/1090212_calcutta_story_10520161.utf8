	A two-member army team on Wednesday morning expressed satisfaction with the restoration work on the Brigade Parade Ground after Sundays Left Front rally, said an army spokesperson.        
	The armymen, however, drew the attention of the Left Front representatives accompanying them to a few more patches that needed to be cleared of muck.        
	A sea of people had descended on the only sprawling greens in the city on Sunday. They parked lorries and buses on the Maidan and cooked in open chullahs, violating a high court order banning both within three kilometres of Victoria Memorial.        
	Before the rally, Left Front chairman Biman Bose had given a written undertaking to the defence ministry that the Maidan would be restored to its previous condition before it was handed back to the army, the custodian of the greens.        
	The undertaking also said that the rallyists would follow the high court order, failing which the organisers would lose the right to hold any more rally on the Maidan.        
	CPM leader Niranjan Chatterjee, who visited the Maidan later on Wednesday, said the army was satisfied with the restoration. We have spoken to representatives of the army. They are satisfied with our work. They pointed out a few places where garbage was heaped and a few more holes that needed to be filled up properly. Our cadres did the needful by evening.        
	To avoid contempt of court, the Left Front deployed around 450 cadres to undo Sundays damage. The repair work started on Monday morning and continued till Wednesday.         
	Metro on Wednesday found heaps of newspapers, sal leaves and polythene bags at some spots. The holes that were dug have been filled up with a mixture of sand and mud.

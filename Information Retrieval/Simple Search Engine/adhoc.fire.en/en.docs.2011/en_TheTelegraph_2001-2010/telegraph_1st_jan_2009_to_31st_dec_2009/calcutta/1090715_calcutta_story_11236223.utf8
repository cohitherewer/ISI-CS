The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Jail term for SDO stayed
                                                                                                               Jail term for SDO stayed
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	A high court division bench on Tuesday stayed an order sentencing Canning sub-divisional officer Mohammed Shahid to a days imprisonment for contempt of court in the car-grab-for-poll case.        
	The division bench headed by Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar stayed the punishment after Shahid tendered an unconditional apology.        
	Shahid had requistioned the Tata Safari of a Canning trader, Sachin Halder, on April 23 for the Lok Sabha polls, ignoring his pleas and protests. Acting on a petition by Halder, Justice Banerjee had on May 5 ordered the SDO to immediately return the car to the owner and pay him compensation.        
	But the order was not carried out, prompting Halder to move a contempt plea in the high court. Justice Banerjee, who heard the petition, sentenced Shahid to a day in jail and ordered him to explain why the compensation was not paid to Halder.         
	Though the sentence has been stayed, the SDO will have to appear before Justice Banerjee and answer his query.        
	The 51-year-old trader had bought the SUV for his wife Gayatri who suffers from skin rashes if she steps out in the sun.         
	Gayatri has to travel 54km once a week to visit her dermatologist.

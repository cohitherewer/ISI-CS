  - Lax vigil foils food, plastic ban          A STAFF REPORTER                          Visitors enjoy outside food on the zoo lawns. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                                        
	Picnic leftovers continue to dirty the zoo with visitors smuggling in food and plastic bags and bottles violating the ban that came into effect on October 1.        
	Other than making announcements, the zoo authorities have done little to implement the ban.        
	On Sunday, Metro found several groups of visitors eating on the zoo lawns. Most left behind food, Styrofoam cups and plates and plastic packets on the grass, ignoring announcements asking them not to do so.        
	Seven youths from Kidderpore were having pulao, bread and banana on a lawn. We know outside food is banned on the premises but we managed to bring it in. Whats wrong with it? said one of them while throwing away banana peals.         
	He had little to fear in the absence of patrolling guards and penal provisions. The only check was at the entrance and even there, all visitors were not being frisked.        
	Our guards are keeping a tab on visitors carrying outside food, polythene bags and plastic bottles. Entry of banned items has come down drastically over the past three days. We are trying to enforce the ban totally, said Raju Das, the director of the zoo.         
	The primary objective is to protect the animals and keep the premises clean. Only infant food and water bottles are allowed on the premises. Even fruits are banned.        
	A zoo official said it was impossible to frisk everyone entering the zoo, especially on weekends. The weekend footfall is double the average weekday footfall and some people are still bringing outside food wrapped in polythene bags and papers. Things might fall in place after a couple of months, he said.        
	Another official said they were planning to slap fines on visitors found carrying banned items.        
	A guard manning the entrance said visitors from the districts did not like being frisked. They come in large groups and carry travel bags with food inside. Its not possible for us to frisk each bag, he said.         
	Das said the zoo authorities were trying to provide safe drinking water on the premises. Water bottles will also be banned in the zoo once we manage to do that, added the director.

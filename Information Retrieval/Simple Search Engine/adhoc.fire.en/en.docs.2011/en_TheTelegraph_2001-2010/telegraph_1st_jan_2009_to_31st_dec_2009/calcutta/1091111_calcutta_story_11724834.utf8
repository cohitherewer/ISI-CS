          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Police have come across some incongruities in the statements of Chandrima Gupta, who had alleged that a driver had assaulted and robbed her after she took a lift in his car on Monday morning.        
	A driver attacking a young woman during peak hours is a serious incident. But apparently there are some incongruities in her statements. It could be that she was very tense. We would like to talk to her again, said deputy commissioner, detective department, Damayanti Sen.        
	Even a day after the incident, the police could not trace the car, a Maruti A-Star, or the woman who was travelling with Chandrima.        
	Accompanied by mother Bimala and friends, Chandrima went to Lalbazar during the day. The third-year law student, who claims to be trained in karate, had mentioned in her complaint that she had hailed the shuttle car in front of AMRI Hospitals around 11.30am to go to her college in Hazra.        
	At the Gariahat crossing, the driver took a left run instead of right and then drove down Southern Avenue to the Lake Gardens flyover, ignoring protests by Chandrima.        
	The driver, flashing a kitchen knife, took away gold rings and two cellphones of Chandrima before she managed to jump out.        
	I could never imagine such a thing happening in the city. Im more worried about the other woman who slumped in the car after being hit by the knife, Bimala said.

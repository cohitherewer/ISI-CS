The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Crime spurt in pre-Puja crowd
                                                                                                               Crime spurt in pre-Puja crowd
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Police have registered more than a dozen complaints of lifting and 18 cases of pickpocketing over the past four days. In all cases, the victims were either shopping in crowded stores or malls or walking down congested roads.        
	Thanks to the Puja-eve crowd in markets, malls and roads, there has been a spurt in crimes such as snatching and lifting, said an officer of the detective department.        
	Its more difficult to identify a lifter than a snatcher. On most occasions victims can describe how the snatchers look but have no clue about the lifters, the officer added.        
	In an attempt to keep crime under check during Puja, the cops had launched preventive drives and arrested more than 1,200 people over the past month.        
	The newcomers in the citys underworld pose a problem for us. They take advantage of the fact that we have no clue about them, said an officer at Lalbazar.         
	Debesh Halder, one of the complainants, told police that someone had picked his cellphone from his trousers pocket while he was shopping in New Market. Soon after the complaint was received, the IMEI number of the cellphone was sent to the service provider, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police, headquarters.        
	ISI accused: A three-member cop team from Delhi took away Jyoti Rana, arrested for her alleged links with Pakistans Inter Services Intelligence, on Thursday.         
	The cops obtained a transit remand for Rana, alias Mehrunnisa, on Wednesday. Rana, accused of recruiting agents for the ISI, was arrested at the city airport on September 20 on the basis of a look-out notice issued by the Foreigners Regional Registration Office. Sleuths said Rana worked in New Delhi and its adjoining areas as Nazneen.        
	Woman dead: A 33-year-old homemaker was found hanging from the ceiling of her bedroom in her in-laws house in Baguiati on Thursday afternoon. Following a complaint by Runa Sahas parents, her husband and in-laws have been arrested.        
	Three injured: Three men were critically injured in two accidents early on Thursday. An unidentified man in his 30s, who was riding a two-wheeler, was injured in the head, face and shoulders after ramming into a guardrail near the JK Island crossing on Red Road around 1am. He was admitted to SSKM Hospital in an unconscious state.         
	A probe revealed the man was drunk. In the other mishap, a motorcycle collided with an unidentified vehicle at the Rajabazar crossing around 1am. Rupdeep Basu, 21 and pillion rider Dibakar Naskar, 22, suffered multiple injuries and were admitted to NRS hospital.

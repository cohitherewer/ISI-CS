                                                                                                               Kidnap cry of schoolgirl rescued from station
  - Police faced with three versions, all narrated by the 10-year-old abducted from Bowbazar       OUR BUREAU                                    
	A 10-year-old girl found crying at Howrah station on Monday morning said she had been abducted by two men from near her school in central Calcutta.        
	The railway cops who spotted the girl near platform 3, however, could not trace the duo on the station premises. Well scan the footage of our closed-circuit TV sets and try to identify the kidnappers, said Ajay Kumar Singh, the inspector of the Howrah RPF booth.    
	The girl, who lives with her parents in a Bangur Avenue apartment, narrated the sequence of events to the railway cops, a team from Bowbazar police station and the school authorities, but the versions did not match.        
	The Class V student of Welland Gouldsmith School told the railway cops that she got off her pool car around 7.30am. As I was walking towards the school with my friends I realised that I had left my water bottle in the car. As I started walking back towards the car, two men dragged me into a blue Maruti and sped off, an officer quoted the girl as saying.        
	The duo, she said, took her to Howrah station where one went to buy train tickets and the other stood beside her. She told the man standing guard that she was hungry. When he left the spot to buy biscuits, a few cops arrived on the scene and found her crying. The girl gave the phone number of her mother to the cops who called her.         
	I was shocked to hear from the police that someone was trying to kidnap my daughter. My husband and I rushed to the station, said the mother.        
	When a team from Bowbazar police went to the girls flat, she told them her water bottle had fallen from her hand while she was walking towards the school. When she bent down to pick it up, a man gagged her with a handkerchief and dragged her into a car. After the two abductors abandoned her at Howrah station, the girl took the cellphone of a man and called her parents. The man later took her to the police.        
	Principal Gilian Rosemary Hart said the girl came to the school along with her mother in the afternoon and narrated the sequence of events.                          
	The child said two men in a blue Maruti car dragged her in while she was picking up her water bottle from the ground. At Howrah, one of them went to buy tickets and the other waited with her on a platform. The girl then requested the man to buy her a bottle of water. As soon as he turned his back, the girl ran away and told a commuter that she had been kidnapped. She called up her mother from his cellphone. The mother immediately called the man whose phone her child had used and requested him to keep an eye on her. The man handed over the girl to the police.

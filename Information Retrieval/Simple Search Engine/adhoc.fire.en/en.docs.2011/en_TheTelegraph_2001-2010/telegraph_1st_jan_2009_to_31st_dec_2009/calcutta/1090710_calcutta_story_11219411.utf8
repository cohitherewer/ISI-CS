                      Imagination and reality                    Though positing two significantly different attitudes in their approach and treatment of art, the ongoing show of paintings, drawings and sculptures by Probal C. Boral and Biswa Basu makes viewers conscious of moments in life where the real merges strangely and inextricably with the unreal. Portraying imagined, imaginary or fantastic figures, it reminds us of aspects of life that are subliminal and imperceptible. Essentially a self-taught artist, Boral showcases works in which he appears to move away from reality into a world of fantasy, though his subjects are mostly figures and images from the world around us. On the other hand, Basu plays with colours, lines and hues to create his own interpretation of life and nature, people and their struggle. He plays with both abstract and figurative forms, creating in the process an interesting array of works, often poetic (as expressed through his landscapes) but mostly thought-provoking.                  Event: Art works by Probal C. Boral and Biswa Basu When: Till July 12; 10 am - 7 pm Where: Chemould Art Gallery, 12F Park Street

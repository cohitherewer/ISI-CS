The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fire code for small traders
                                                                                                               Fire code for small traders
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                                          
	The civic authorities are trying to put in place practical fire-prevention norms for small businesses after the mandatory blaze clearance for shops and other establishments proved a non-starter.         
	Shops and other establishments should have the basic preparedness to put out fires in initial stages. If that can be done, conflagration can be avoided, said mayoral council member Dipankar Dey, who is in charge of issuing trade licences.         
	We have decided to bring out a fire-prevention code for small businesses, such as eateries with kitchens and shops selling inflammable goods. Discussions are on with fire brigade experts to finalise the code. Representatives of traders organisation will be invited, if necessary, added Dey.        
	The 100-hour Nandaram fire in Burrabazar had in June 2008 prompted the civic body to make it mandatory for traders to produce clearance certificates from the fire brigade.        
	There are over five lakh business establishments enlisted with the CMC, of which about three lakh have not been able to renew their trade licences as they could not produce the clearance certificate from the fire brigade. As a result, civic revenue by way of licence fees have come down from Rs 30 crore per annum to Rs 17 crore.        
	Welcoming the civic authorities move, the president of the Federation of Traders Organisation, Taraknath Trivedi, said: We are not against the CMCs policy of introducing fire-prevention measures in shops and other establishments. But the regulating authorities must be aware of the financial constraints of traders.        
	According to him, most shops are on rented premises and the landlords dont allow modifications to their properties. If the fire brigade imposes a burden of Rs 10 or 15 lakh on a small trader or asks him to construct an emergency door on rented premises, the system will never work. Only the number of unlicensed businesses will go up manifold, Trivedi added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Metro in mess of own making
                                                                                                               Metro in mess of own making
  - Commuters tripped by lack of planning        SANJAY MANDAL AND SUBHAJOY ROY           Sanjay Pandey, who was on a train and saw sparks on the tracks on Sunday,   recounts his experience
      At 3.30pm, I boarded a train from Garia Bazar station and took a seat in the fourth-last bogie. As soon as the train left the next station (Naktala), I heard a strange creaking and clanging sound from the tracks.   The doors opened and we spilled out on to the platform of Bansdroni to check if anything was wrong. The drivers walked up to our bogie but found ldquo;nothing wrong rdquo; and urged us to board the train and continue our journey.  But within seconds, I could see sparks on the tracks. Almost at once, the power went off and we were stranded between Bansdroni and Kudghat stations. After what seemed like an eternity, the power returned.    When the train finally rolled into Netaji station, we leapt out. I walked up to the station master rsquo;s cabin to enquire what the problem was.   He slammed the door on me before saying: ldquo;Please don rsquo;t disturb us. You don rsquo;t know how serious the issue is.... rdquo; Later, he made an announcement that all passengers should vacate the train.      
	Tunnel vision has turned Metro Railway from Calcuttas most punctual  and trusted  mass transit system into one struggling to keep pace with the basic needs of the commuter.        
	So didnt the authorities see problems coming before throwing the extension open? We had expected traffic to increase but definitely not by around 40 per cent. The task of ferrying more passengers and running more trains with the same infrastructure and manpower is telling on us, admitted an official who didnt wish to be named.         
	General manager V.N. Tripathy, the only Metro official now authorised to make statements, denied there was a problem with services following the inauguration of the 5.83km Tollygunge-Garia Bazar route. We are running smoothly, and congestion is being reported only during the evening rush hour, he claimed.        
	Thats a lie, countered Chitra Sen, a schoolteacher and a Metro regular. Ever since August 23, nothing is going right. The Metro today is overcrowded and chaotic and never on time.        
	Sources in Metro Railway blamed poor planning for the snags that have slowed down the citys transport lifeline. The management knew that we would need more manpower to operate ticket counters after the addition of stations but didnt bother deploying more people, said an official.        
	According to Metro Railways operating standards, a passenger should be able to enter a station, buy a ticket and reach the platform in not more than three minutes. There should not be more than 15 people in a queue.        
	They should revise that to 30 minutes and 150 people if they cannot get their act together in a hurry, snaps Samadrita Sengupta, a student of Presidency College.         
	Another example of Metro Railway taking the expansion plunge without proper planning is the exit turnstile that hasnt been reconfigured to match the new fare chart. With the gates remaining open and not enough personnel to conduct random checks, a commuter with a single-zone ticket can easily travel two zones.         
	That translates into loss of revenue for Metro Railway but the authorities dont seem bothered, a source said.        
	Officials blamed the Centre for Railway Information Systems for the delay in reconfiguring the turnstiles and said work was in progress but failed to explain why the work wasnt commissioned earlier.        
	The organisation has started work, and there is pressure from the railway ministry to complete the task as quickly as possible. In any case, we are to replace the existing tickets with a smart token system, a Metro official said.        
	Things can only get worse in the festive weeks, warn sources. Passenger count is expected to rise by another 20 per cent in the run-up to Puja, said an official.

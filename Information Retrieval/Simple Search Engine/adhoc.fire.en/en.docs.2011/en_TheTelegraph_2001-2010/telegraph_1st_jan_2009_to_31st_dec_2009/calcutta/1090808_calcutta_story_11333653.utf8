The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CID submits tree fell report
                                                                                                               CID submits tree fell report
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          The tree-fell site on the Botanic Garden premises. A Telegraph picture                                  
	The CID on Friday submitted to the high court its report on the alleged felling of trees by the authorities of the Indian Botanic Gardens on November 14, 2008.         
	The contents of the report could not be accessed as it was placed in a sealed cover and the court decided to open it later.         
	The garden authorities also filed an application before the court on Friday claiming that as the garden was under the Union government, state agencies like the CID had no right to conduct an inquiry into its affairs.         
	After receiving the report and application, the division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice B. Somadder fixed the next hearing after two weeks.        
	Environment activist Subhash Dutta had moved court in November 2008 alleging that the garden authorities had ordered the felling of around 100 trees on its premises. He had submitted photographs to support his claim.        
	On the basis of Duttas petition, the court had constituted a three-member committee to probe the incident. The committee in its report confirmed Duttas allegation.        
	The report, which was submitted before the court on November 28, 2008, had prompted the court to ask the CID to conduct an inquiry and file a report before the court.        
	In its application on Friday, the garden authorities also claimed that since the garden was under the direct control of the Botanical Survey of India, the provisions of the West Bengal Trees ( Protection and Conservation) Act, 2006, were not applicable to the garden. The authorities also challenged the legality of the inquiry conducted by the three-member panel.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Billboard ban on the cards
                                                                                                               Billboard ban on the cards
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                                            
	The civic body is set to designate six no-billboard zones and implement the ban on outdoor advertisement of tobacco products, alcohol and drugs more strictly.        
	The new outdoor advertising policy of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, slated to come into effect this month, will lay down strictures regarding the billboard size and content in an attempt to curb visual pollution and aid traffic management, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.        
	We have tried to check the attempt by some outdoor advertising agencies to turn the city into a billboard jungle. Our earnings from outdoor advertising will fall but this is necessary to make the city more aesthetically appealing, said Bandyopadhyay.        
	The no-billboard zones will include portions of Jawaharlal Nehru Road, Maidan and BBD Bag.        
	There is currently a ban on billboards on heritage buildings, government and civic offices, hospitals, educational institutions and religious places.         
	The list will be extended to include tourist spots, nursing homes, libraries, the Hooghly, water bodies, playgrounds and open spaces.        
	The municipal commissioner will enjoy the right to not allow a billboard if he finds its content, size, position, illumination and other characteristics to be in conflict with the ambience of the area, traffic safety and architectural character of the building.        
	According to an estimate of the advertising department, the new rules will cost the civic exchequer Rs 10 crore.        
	The rules, for the first time, are binding on the CMC and the government.        
	All forms of advertisement on land, water body and in air will come under the purview of the policy.        
	Besides the CMC, the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority, public works department and Calcutta Port Trust own several billboards that they let out to outdoor advertising agencies. Over 200 of these billboards will have to be pulled down once the new rules come into effect.

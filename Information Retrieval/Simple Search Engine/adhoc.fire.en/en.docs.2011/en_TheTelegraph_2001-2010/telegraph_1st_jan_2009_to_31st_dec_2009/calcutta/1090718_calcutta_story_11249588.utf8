The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Plea on choice of bus model 
                                                                                                               Plea on choice of bus model 
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The Bengal Bus Syndicate moved the high court on Friday seeking an order directing the state government to permit replacement of over 15-year-old buses with new BS-III compliant Tata Motors models.        
	The green bench could not hear the petition as lawyers and officers of the court did not turn up because of the bandh.        
	The bus operators prefer the four-cylinder vehicles over the six-cylinder ones shortlisted by the government because of their lower cost and better fuel efficiency.        
	The syndicate stated in its petition that the state transport department was not allowing them to ply the four-cylinder buses within the Calcutta Metropolitan Area (CMA).        
	But the department allowed the Calcutta Tramways Company and the Calcutta Surface Transport Corporation to operate four-cylinder buses within the CMA, stated the petition. The cost of a six-cylinder bus is Rs 14.5 lakh while a four-cylinder one costs Rs 10.5 lakh, said the petition.        
	Transport department officials refused to comment on the plea.

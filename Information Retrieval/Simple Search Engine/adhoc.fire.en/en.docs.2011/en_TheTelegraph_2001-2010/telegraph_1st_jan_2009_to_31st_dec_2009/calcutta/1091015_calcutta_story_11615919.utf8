                                                                                                               Scan farce after let-off
          A STAFF REPORTER                           An officer measures the distance between the Naba Yubak Sangha pandal and the adjacent house on Wednesday. Picture by Amit Datta                                  
	The fire services and police expressed satisfaction with Kali puja arrangements by Naba Yubak Sangha (better known as Fatakeshtos puja) the day after a high court judge allowed the puja, citing public sentiment.        
	Firemen and cops inspected the pandal on Wednesday morning, acting on an order by Justice B. Somadder, who had asked the administration to see to it that the puja is held like in previous years.        
	The pandal blocks a 14ft-wide lane and does not keep 4ft free on all sides.         
	We are satisfied with the fire-safety measures adopted by the organisers, said divisional fire officer Bibhas Guha after the inspection. Biswarup Ghosh, the deputy commissioner of police (north), echoed him.        
	Measurements by police officers on Thursday showed the highest distance between the pandal and the adjacent house is 4 feet and the lowest 1 foot and 11 inches.         
	In the run-up to Durga puja, Justice Sanjib Banerjee of the high court had endorsed guidelines drawn up by the state agencies and ordered the police to demolish the pandals that dont abide by all norms.        
	The organisers admitted that this years experience would make them more cautious next time.        
	If we find that all Durga puja pandals are being forced to leave 4ft on all sides next year, we too will follow suit, said Dhananjoy Dhar, one of the organisers.

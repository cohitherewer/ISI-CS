The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Call for young golf talent
                                                                                                               Call for young golf talent
          SUBHRO SAHA                          LEVEL PLAYING FIELD: Young Manavi Halwasiya and V.K. Singh, who at 65 is the oldest golfer at this years meet, share a light moment at the RCGC on Wednesday morning. Picture by Gautam Basu                                  
	Golf is a great leveller, it teaches you crisis management, and to think on your feet. Most importantly, it teaches you to forget what happened at the last hole  Bill Gates, at a recent survey of Fortune 500 CEOs        
	In Calcutta, a ready platform for the biz-birdie connect has existed for over 100 years. The British started a Merchants Cup in almost every sport, even bridge. But no other mercantile meet has been able to forge corporate camaraderie quite like the golf competition, which was teed off in 1906.        
	What Geo Henderson amp; Co started as the first winners, when the course was located in Barrackpore, has been carried forward in recent times by the likes of Bunny Lakshman Singh and Alan Singh, representing corporate Calcuttas leading lights like Williamson Magor and the Tatas.        
	The vintage tournament, interrupted only by the two World Wars, and being held since 1947 at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club, the oldest outside the British Isles, is crying out for fresh blood to help prevent dilution of the field in future.        
	We have to create a new breed of golfers to take over the mantle, Brandon D Souza, the CEO and managing director of Tiger Sports Marketing (TSM), which runs the event, tells Metro.        
	The Senbo-presented Telegraph Cup Golf in association with Ballantines this year boasts a field of 110 teams, which translates into 440 golfers. That would almost add up to the total number of active golfers in this city wielding their irons on weekends.        
	The tournament has continued to grow and new companies are coming through, but are there enough youngsters joining the fray? Probably not, feels Jaideep Chitlangia, who along with brother Sudip and son Akhilesh, have been representing Madhya Bharat Papers, a perennial powerhouse.        
	To ensure a steady stream of adroit young golfers enriching The Telegraph Cup field, corporate HRs should be able to also recruit youngsters proficient in golf, and not just go for MBAs, says Jaideep.        
	Yes, you need three to win and make a mark. Sadly, often you dont get that many decent golfers in a company these days, says Bunny.        
	The want of enough able corporate golfers has led to the erstwhile purely mercantile meet format being tweaked. Instead of six-member teams, only three executive golfers based in the eastern region would suffice now.        
	There are, however, silver linings. For one, the increased participation of small and medium enterprises, like the Manaksiya Group and South India Projects. And of course, a new breed of youngsters like Akhilesh Chitlangia and Manavi Halwasiya, who had stunned the city by winning the East India ladies meet as a 16-year-old six years back.        
	Im glad to be able to play in The Telegraph Cup this year, says Manavi, a Modern High alumnus who is now doing her business administration at Lynn University, Florida, specialising in fashion marketing and management. Not keen to pursue golf as a career, Manavi would however love to come back and represent her own fashion marketing outfit in the tournament some day.        
	D Souza feels many more youngsters like Manavi, who can play the game and develop into well-rounded corporate executives, are needed. He prescribes a five-pronged programme to get more numbers, and not fall back on the same beat-up guys.        
	Taking it to schools and making golf part of the curriculum is the ideal tee-off for the TSM boss. To make it affordable for the school kids, there has to be an initial investment. The coaches must be accountable, there has to be enough competition and case studies of local success stories like Bunny must be leveraged, he says.

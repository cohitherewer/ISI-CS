The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cops halt crackdown on CM auto cue
                                                                                                               Cops halt crackdown on CM auto cue
          OUR BUREAU                               
	Police paused the auto crackdown on Sunday expecting the government to seek time to phase out polluting two-stroke engines and paying no heed to the high court ban from January 1.        
	The government is scheduled to make a mention in the high court on Monday about its plan to file a petition. The backlash from auto operators and supposed lack of infrastructure and inconvenience to commuters will be cited as the reasons for seeking more time  possibly three months  to implement the ban.         
	As of now, the plan is to seek the courts permission to file a petition for an extension of the deadline (that expired on December 31), state advocate-general Balai Roy said.         
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees announcement on Saturday that the government would seek more time appeared to be the signal for the police to stop. Not a single auto was impounded on Sunday, leading to more three-wheelers plying on the streets than in the past three days.         
	The police had seized 43 autos within the first three days of the high court ban taking effect, triggering violent protests across the city.         
	I knew that the police would not target autos on Sunday; so I decided to bring out my vehicle, said Paresh Gupta, who runs his decade-old two-stroke auto on the Jadavpur-Taratala route.        
	According to him, auto union leaders  both from Citu and the Trinamul-backed Auto Bachao Committee  had assured drivers last night that there would not be any crackdown on autos on Sunday.         
	But Dilip Banerjee, the deputy commissioner of police (traffic), clarified that not impounding a single auto on a given day did not mean the crackdown was over. This is a continuous process and cannot be implemented in a day. Our crackdown will continue, he said.         
	Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty continued to wear two hats on the issue. The government will implement the high court order. Auto owners and drivers co-operating with the government will get full support. We will smash the autos of those who do not co-operate, some television channels quoted him as saying.         
	Chakraborty had issued similar warnings before, only to go back on his words.         
	A senior officer in the traffic department said there wouldnt be much action on the streets on Monday because all eyes would be on the court. We wouldnt like to take any chances after having faced law and order problems in the last three days. We will wait for the outcome of the legal proceedings.        
	The chief minister is scheduled to hold a meeting on the issue with senior officials on Monday morning. We need to discuss how to go about seeking an extension. We will discuss it with the advocate-general, home secretary Ardhendu Sen told Metro.        
	Bhattacharjee will leave for Delhi along with Sen and chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti later in the day.

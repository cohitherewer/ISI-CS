The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Against the odds
                                                                                                               Against the odds
                            
	Sisir Nag of Salt Lake        
	The 85-year-old patient of prostate cancer has a heart block and a damaged knee, but all that could not stop him from voting. I havent missed a vote since 1952 and will continue to vote as long as I have an ounce of strength left in my body, said Nag, head resting on wife Nibeditas shoulder.              
	Anima Ghosh of Belgachhia        
	The 94-year-old fractured her waistbone 10 years ago and cannot stand upright since. But she came to the polling booth with a helping hand in a taxi and cast her vote.              
	Ravi Shekhar Gupta and Shyam Dev Gupta of Belgachhia        
	Ravi carried his paralysed father, Shyam, 64, from their Kundu Lane home to the polling centre. My fathers limbs were paralysed four years ago after a mystery fever. He is my father and it was my responsibility to help him vote, said the taxi driver.              
	Mona Singhania of Lord Sinha Road        
	Just after noon, as the 38-year-old schoolteacher stood outside the polling booth at Sri Shikshayatan college, she heard angry voices. A voter carrying his passport but not his voter ID card was not being allowed in. She too was carrying only her passport, but was armed with the Metro voters guide stating that a passport was good enough. When she was refused, she promptly called up the Election Commission helpline (22437017) given in Metro. To my pleasant surprise, the phone was picked up after one ring and I was assured that I would be allowed to vote. Within 10 minutes, a call came to the presiding officer informing him that the passport was a valid document and so I must be allowed to vote! This promptness has reaffirmed my faith in the electoral system.

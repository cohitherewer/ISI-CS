The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Chief nurse held in medical scam
                                                                                                               Chief nurse held in medical scam
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The nurse-in-charge of NRS Medical College and Hospital was arrested on Thursday night for allegedly smuggling medicines and consumables out of the hospital.         
	Sabitri Dalal, 55, hailing from Murshidabad, was posted at the hospital for 11 years. She, with the help of other employees, sold off life-saving drugs meant for poor patients and other medicines and equipment stocked by the hospital, said an investigator.         
	Two Group D employees of the hospital, Bina Turi and Mohammad Taufique, arrested on the same charge on July 18 revealed Dalals alleged role in the racket during interrogation.        
	Sabitri was a key member of the racket and her arrest would help us to track down all those involved. She has been remanded in police custody, added the investigator.        
	The racket came to light in the first week of July with the arrested of 43-year-old Naresh Rajak in his Sealdah home, where a huge quantity of medicines and medical equipment stolen from state-run hospitals was stocked.        
	According to the police, Rajak used to receive stolen medical supplies from a section of NRS employees and sell them to traders in Bagri Market.        
	We have got tip-offs about 10 hospital employees and six receivers involved with the racket. They are absconding, said an officer.         
	The investigators are scanning documents provided by the health department, mentioning the details of supplies sent to hospitals, to ascertain the reach of the racket.         
	Its strange that senior officials were in the dark about the racket, said an officer.

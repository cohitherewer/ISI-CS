The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mamata in budget mode
                                                                                                               Mamata in budget mode
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Ten days before the railway budget, Mamata made it clear on Tuesday that austerity must begin at office. And the first to feel the squeeze will be railway officials eyeing frequent foreign jaunts.        
	We have taken several austerity measures, especially curtailing foreign trips by officials. The funds thus saved will be used to create infrastructure and enhance safety standards, the railway minister said while inaugurating an office of the Circular Railway at Majherhat station.        
	Senior officials, she added, at times need to visit other countries to learn about their railway networks and technologies. But only those trips that are absolutely necessary will be approved.         
	As for herself, Mamata said she would not travel in the ministers special carriage. I will travel in a passenger compartment, as I did during my previous stint as railway minister. It will give me the opportunity to communicate with the people.        
	Public relations and punctuality must go hand-in-hand in Mamatas ministry. So, a system has been introduced to monitor whether trains are running on time.        
	I am taking up a drive to enforce punctuality in the service. We are trying to achieve 85 per cent punctuality and all senior officials have been asked to monitor the service and submit reports every week, said Mamata.        
	In please-all mode, the minister called for the happy co-existence of hawkers and passengers. Its a two-way traffic. They should not disturb one another, she said.        
	As for revenues, she admitted that earnings from freight would take a hit because of the downturn, but not for long.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Plea against IPS officer transfer
                                                                                                               Plea against IPS officer transfer
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          Nazrul Islam                                  
	The transfer of IPS officer Nazrul Islam to the judicial department was challenged in the high court on Thursday by an advocate.        
	The state government issued a notification on January 20, transferring Islam from the post of inspector-general of police (welfare) in the home department to director (prosecution) in the judicial department.         
	Ibrahim Sheikh, the lawyer, stated in his petition that the government had violated the law while transferring Islam. According to the petitioner, the director (prosecution) must have a law degree and 10 years experience as a lawyer in a higher court  which the IPS officer does not have.         
	Sheikh also claimed that the government should have taken permission from the chief justice of the high court before appointing Islam to the post. The director (prosecution) looks after the affairs of public prosecutors across the state.        
	Lawyers said Section 25 of the amended CrPC Act had empowered the state to appoint a senior police officer to the directors post but he or she must have a law degree. Islam was transferred shortly after the state had to pay him a fine of Re 1 for maligning him publicly by starting a vigilance commission case against him.

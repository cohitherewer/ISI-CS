                      Through the viewfinder                    Wanderlust is a state of restless existence that is fuelled by an insatiable desire to see, hear, smell, taste and feel things both new and old. It is a search for that moment of clarity that holistically depicts the truth of any given place, time or person. The streets, alleys and open spaces of India offer a million stimuli to the senses of even the most casual observer; a million different decisive moments occurring all at once, a million different truths passing uncaptured. Even amidst this fluid chaos, the camera is capable of rendering to perfect stillness a moment of unadulterated truth with a blink of the shutter. Each image, effectively remains for time immemorial a testament of that place and time in which it was taken. Be it the young monk, trying hard to stay awake during early morning prayer, or the timeless smile of an old man in a chai shop. These images are no more than documentation of realities that photographer Varun Gupta was fortunate to experience during his travels across the length and breadth of the country. The images on display at Give In To Wanderlust, the ongoing exhibition of his photographs, have been carefully selected from the last three years of his travels. His images are part of an ongoing body of work that is bound to expand as his journey through life continues.                    Event: An exhibition of photographs by Varun Gupta When: Till November 11; 10 am - 7 pm Where: Weavers Studio Centre for the Arts, 94 Ballygunge Place

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cop shoots himself
                                                                                                               Cop shoots himself
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 52-year-old assistant sub-inspector of the state armed police committed suicide by shooting himself in the head at Alipore Bodyguard Lines early on Sunday.         
	Krishna Das, a resident of Chetla, pulled the trigger of his service revolver shortly after returning to the barracks following night duty.         
	The bullet pierced Dass skull, killing him instantly. He slumped to the floor in front of the armoury.        
	Das was bachelor and lived with his sisters in their Gobinda Auddy Road home.        
	No suicide note was found. Dass family members also failed to provide us with any lead, said an officer of Alipore police station.        
	Das was on duty at Calcutta station from around 9pm on Saturday. He returned to the police lines around 8.45am and headed straight to the armoury, where cops deposit their service revolvers after duty.        
	Instead of entering the office of the armoury, Das went to a corner of a passage. He took the weapon out of the holster. The other cops did not suspect anything till they heard the gunfire.         
	We took him to SSKM Hospital where doctors declared him dead on arrival, said an officer.        
	He was an introvert. Knowing what was going in his mind was very difficult, said one of Dass colleagues.        
	Senior officers said the assistant sub-inspector did not have problems at work. Some incident in his personal life might have triggered the suicide, said Rajesh Subarna, the deputy commissioner of police (south division).

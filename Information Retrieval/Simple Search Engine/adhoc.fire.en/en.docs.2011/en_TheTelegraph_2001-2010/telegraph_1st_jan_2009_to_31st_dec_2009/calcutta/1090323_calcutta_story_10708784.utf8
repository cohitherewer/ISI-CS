The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Plexes pin hope on movie buffet 
                                                                                                               Plexes pin hope on movie buffet 
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Thirteen films at INOX (Forum). Fourteen films at Fame (South City).        
	Its an all-you-can-watch movie buffet out there at the multiplexes, but minus any big Bollywood star draw. This has given discerning cinegoers reason to return to the theatres and given some breathing space to the halls (hounded by downturn, dispute and IPL2).        
	The six new releases on Friday  four small but varied Bollywood films (Firaaq, Aloo Chaat, Barah Aana and Straight), one multi-starrer English movie (Hes Just Not That Into You), and an oven-fresh Bangla film (Challenge)  have boosted the city box office, which has been struggling for the past few weeks.        
	Things have certainly looked up this weekend, says Vikas Syal, the general manager of INOX (Forum). The key has been variety when you add last weeks releases like Gulaal and Little Zizou to the new releases, there is so much to choose from. From comedy to action to drama, there are films of all genres. So people have been catching something or the other.        
	As a spokesperson for Fame Cinemas put it, with the big movies not releasing in recent weeks, regular moviegoers are making do with small films.        
	If Bollywood is small but varied at the plexes, Tollywood has gone big on attitude at standalones. Raj Chakrabortys Challenge, starring Dev and Subhashree, is off to a flying start.         
	Says Mahendra Soni of Shree Venkatesh Films, producer and distributor of the film: Prachi and Mitra have had all four shows houseful through the weekend. And the one show in Priya is also going packed. Even its two shows at Fame (Hiland Park) are doing quite well.        
	The collection of Challenge is over Rs 1 lakh everyday which is phenomenal, adds Dipendra Krishna Mitra, owner of Mitra cinema. We are expecting Challenge to break all records. Bollywood isnt looking at setting any new records and would be happy to stay afloat in the face of a multiplex black-out from April over a tussle with the producers, and then the second season of the IPL.         
	Says trade analyst Taran Adarsh: If films dont release at plexes because of their tiff with the producers, the month of April will only add to the gloom. The small films that have been releasing are getting carried away with offbeat plots, something the audience in India is not used to watching.        
	In such a scenario, the upcoming Friday releases  the Bipasha Basu-Neil Nitin Mukesh-starrer Aa Dekhen Zara and Deepa Mehtas Videsh, starring Preity Zinta  will be a desperate throw of the dice for Bollywood.         
	We are banking heavily on Aa Dekhen Zara and we will give it quite a few shows but at the same time we wouldnt take off a lot of movies because variety can continue to be the spice of the season, sums up Syal from the Elgin Road plex.

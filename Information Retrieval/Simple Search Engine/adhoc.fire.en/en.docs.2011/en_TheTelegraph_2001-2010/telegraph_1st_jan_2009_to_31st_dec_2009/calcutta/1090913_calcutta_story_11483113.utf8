The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Football or shoe brush? 
                                                                                                               Football or shoe brush? 
										      eyewitness                        Volker Albus with his Oriental carpet on display at Birla Academy of Art amp; Culture. (Aranya Sen)				                           
	Shelves are usually stable. Here they wobble. Street lamps usually dont have funnel-shaped shades like indoor lamps. If they do, they could create the ambience of a home even in a park. Oriental carpets are usually exotic. Here they resemble advertisements blown up. Filing cabinets turn into beds. A football hanging from a string turns into a shoe brush when kicked. The backrests of discarded chairs become hall stands for hanging jackets.        
	The exhibition Somewhat Different that has opened at the Birla Academy of Art amp; Culture was organised by the Institute for Foreign Cultural Affairs in Germany and Goethe-Institut/Max Mueller Bhavan. It introduces viewers to alternate designs of things of everyday use that are not necessarily pretty or beautiful, but provide design solutions aimed at breaking stereotypes and dogmas, and are at the same time user-friendly.         
	Volker Albus, who teaches at the HFG Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design in Frankfurt, curated the exhibition displaying the works of 47 individual designers and studios based in Germany along with 20 works of designers based in other European countries to break national thinking.        
	Albus is here along with Oliver Vogt, who has done workshops with handicapped people. Vogts chair is lined with horsehair instead of upholstery in a playful manner. Albus explained that the waving shelf was cheaper, had a constructive advantage and signified a different approach to function. His own Oriental carpet in bright yellow and red was an ad for a sale specifying the slashed price. As German people only looked at such products in monetary terms without any relation to the visual, he linked the two.         
	Some designs were witty like the artificial creepers for walls that can substitute wall paper and room dividers, and the circular ping pong table that can be used for meetings and for serving dinner as well. This is a different interpretation of a traditional ornament, said Albus.         
	However, Indians may find a chair that can be used as a bookshelf as well unacceptable as they never sit on books, Albus admitted. Instead of creating perfect designs the aim was to create designs out of different habits.

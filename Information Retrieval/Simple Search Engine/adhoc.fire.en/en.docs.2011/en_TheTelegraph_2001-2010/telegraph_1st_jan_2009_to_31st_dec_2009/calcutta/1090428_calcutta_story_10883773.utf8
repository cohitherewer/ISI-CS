The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | SSKM goes soft on hostel protesters
                                                                                                               SSKM goes soft on hostel protesters
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Students protest on SSKM campus. A Telegraph picture                                  
	The hostel fracas at SSKM Hospital was partially resolved on Monday with the authorities not taking any disciplinary action against the erring students. They have decided to reallocate hostel rooms to prevent trouble in future.        
	There was, however, tension on the campus with the SUCI-affiliated All India Democratic Students Organisation (AIDSO) threatening to launch an agitation if the two students thrown out of the Main Hostel were not reinstated.        
	The decision to reallocate rooms was taken at an emergency college council meeting on Monday. Rooms will be allocated on each floor on the basis of year. Students of a particular year will stay on a particular floor, said Pradip Mitra, the director of the Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research (IPGMER) at SSKM.         
	Students of various years now stay together on each floor by forming groups, which leads to trouble, Mitra pointed out.        
	Trouble broke out at the Main Hostel on Saturday after the authorities asked two students  Kabir Hossain and Diptangshu Ganguly to vacate their rooms on charges of drunken behaviour and threatening SFI supporters.         
	After the duo were dragged out by police, AIDSO supporters had allegedly ransacked the rooms of students belonging to a rival group. Twenty-eight students were arrested and later released on bail. The hostel authorities had lodged an FIR against them.        
	At Mondays meeting, office bearers of the AIDSO-controlled IPGMER students union had demanded withdrawal of the FIR but the authorities did not relent.        
	If these students resort to such behaviour in future, strong legal and disciplinary action would be taken against them, said Mitra.         
	SSKM officials said a number of students who were involved in Saturdays violence had given an undertaking last year after a similar incident on the campus.        
	Sources in SSKM said the authorities were lenient because of political pressure. We received a number of phone calls from political parties asking us not to take serious action because of the elections, said a hospital official.        
	The AIDSO has threatened to start a strong movement if the duo were not allowed to return to the Main Hostel on Tuesday. They were framed by SFI supporters and a section of the authorities, said Mridul Sarkar, the vice-president of AIDSOs state committee.

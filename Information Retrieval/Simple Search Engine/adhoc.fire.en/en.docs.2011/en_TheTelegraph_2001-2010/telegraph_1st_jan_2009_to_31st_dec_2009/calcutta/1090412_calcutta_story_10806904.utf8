The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fact, fiction and fear 
                                                                                                               Fact, fiction and fear 
										      eyewitness                        Dipyaman Kars work at Aakriti Art Gallery				                           
	A brand new gallery named Experimenter has opened on Hindusthan Road with a compact exhibition curated by Paula Sengupta, titled Tell-tale: Fiction, Falsehood amp; Fact.         
	Each artist is allowed to tell his or her tale that is a commentary on our times. At the outset are the block prints of Archana Hande on the accordion book with its male and female figures, thought bubbles and the Harappan bull, all of which are allowed to mingle on the stark white surface of the work. Her animated film questions our notions of class and race and our attempts at transmogrifying Indian cities on international models. She harnesses digital technology and traditional skills as well to create her prints.        
	Senguptas recipe books demonstrate how our colonial legacy impacted indigenous culture. The table is laid out the way Brits supposedly did but the recipes demonstrate how the two cultures clashed and commingled and how this hodgepodge has penetrated our everyday lives. The Orient and its appropriation and interpretation by the West recur in Abhishek Hazras video and his close-ups of Matisses Oriental designs. He references a Tintin comic and the French ethnographer-anthropologist, Claude Levi-Strauss, as evidence of the Wests Oriental design. Yet, however clever his ideas (Google Ads) may be, his video is hardly visually arresting.        
	Adip Dattas books are created as sculptural objects, the one crafted out of steel wool looking menacing with its rough, knotty surface that could lacerate. The other object has a seemingly printed surface but its text is illegible. Both books defeat the purpose for which books are actually created.        
	Debnath Basu creates very fine drawings inspired by Nabarun Bhattacharyas Fatarus, the fantastic winged creature with the mission of disrupting culture and its manifestations in society at large. Basus grey world is peopled with decapitated figures and men winging with their hands and the crush of humanity in a living hell.              
	The Art Against Terrorism series has at last come to an end with the exhibition at Aakriti Art Gallery. This too is a surprisingly cohesive show with not too many works to confuse and confound viewers. Chhatrapati Duttas hands pointing in different directions illustrates the penetration of fear in our private space. Fear is embodied in the work by young Dipyaman Kar. However, his human beings forming that word in a blow-up may seem contrived. Paula Senguptas installation born out of a collaborative workshop with special schoolchildren is based on counterfeit Urdu primers that preach violence in Pakistan. The use of two Urdu words, however, may create the mistaken impression that this exhibition is targeted at Islamic terrorists alone. Abhijit Gupta handles visual language effectively and this is evident from his book. But Sanjeet Choudhurys photograph of Taj juxtaposed with a map of Mumbai in Bengali falls on its face. He should stick to photography.              
	Preetima Pande, according to a handout, has a wide range of interests, including painting, and being from an army family, has travelled far and wide in this country. She also has a passion for nature, and conjures up its beauty in her paintings that were exhibited recently at the Academy of Fine Arts. She uses soft shades of brown, ochre and green to paint forests and sunrise. It goes to her credit that she does not copy nature from photographs but tries to capture its essence through images that are midway between realism and abstract. Her colour scheme is quite soothing.       SOUMITRA DAS

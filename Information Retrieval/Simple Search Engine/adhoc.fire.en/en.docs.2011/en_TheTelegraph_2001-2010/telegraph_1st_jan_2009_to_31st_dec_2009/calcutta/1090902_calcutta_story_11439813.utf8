                      Extracted imagination        The French word collage literally means pasting, and in art, it refers to works with elements glued to the surface. The technique is a modernist mainstay, with Braque and Picasso in the forefront, closely followed by the Dadaists and the Surrealists. Often witty and fanciful, collage allows artists to break the rules of visual logic and impose their own versions of order in the chaos of perception. In Cut and Paste, the ongoing show, the artists provide a feast for the eye and the imagination, demonstrating the techniques seemingly infinite variability using the traditional pasted paper method. They also use the physicality of collage as a medium to great effect: with digits, scissors and glue they construct poetic reality as a concrete visual image. Minuscule snippets of the real world are extracted from their original contexts and rebuilt into dreamscapes of wondrous juxtaposition. Participants: Rajen Bali, Mitali Dey, Ranjan Sarkar, Sk. Shakila and Ashok Varma.

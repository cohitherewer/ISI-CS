The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Will finds way to beat rally
                                                                                                               Will finds way to beat rally
          CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE                                            
	Abhirup Choudhury left his Alipore home at 8.30am for a brush with the American way of life, braving a trademark disrupt-and-let-disrupt day in his hometown.        
	I arrived early at the American Centre for the pre-departure orientation session for students leaving this fall. Ill have trouble getting back home because of the rally but there was no way I could miss this session, said Abhirup, set to pursue a BTech degree in the US.        
	Abhirup was among a hundred other US-bound students who kept their date with the American Center briefing despite the traffic chaos caused by Mamata Banerjees army on Tuesday.        
	When you have to, you just have to, summed up one participant, displaying a rare sense of purpose in a city where a rally or a bandh almost always becomes the excuse to stay home.        
	According to Sunrit Mullick, the regional officer and educational adviser of the United States-India Educational Foundation (USIEF), Tuesday saw a record turnout, a rise of around 50 per cent over last year.        
	Fifty per cent, sources said, was all that the attendance registers at Writers Buildings showed on Tuesday, as the Mamata show paralysed traffic and sent office footfall in the central business district plummeting.        
	Just like the Congress bandh had done on Friday. But on that day too, while the city wore a deserted look, the visa counter at the US Consulate was bustling. We have never had a low turnout for visa interviews on days of bandhs or rallies, said a consular source.        
	Amit Das (name changed on request) was among those who made it for his visa interview on July 17. I reached the area before 6am and hung around till my turn came. I walked 45 minutes on my way back home, said the advertising professional from Ballygunge, before adding with a wink: Where there is a will, there is a way, even for a true-blue Calcuttan!        
	On Tuesday, too, this will among a few was all too visible as babus bunked office but students flocked to the American Center to know about course selection, examination system, safety on campus and more.        
	This was a one-time opportunity that I did not want to miss, so I did not worry too much about the rally, said Vishal Kotecha, a resident of Bhowanipore.        
	Arjun Mukherjee, who is US-bound for a doctorate in computer science, also played down the Trinamul traffic-stopper.         
	I know I will have to face hell while getting back home to VIP Road, but I cannot let one political rally jeopardise my future.

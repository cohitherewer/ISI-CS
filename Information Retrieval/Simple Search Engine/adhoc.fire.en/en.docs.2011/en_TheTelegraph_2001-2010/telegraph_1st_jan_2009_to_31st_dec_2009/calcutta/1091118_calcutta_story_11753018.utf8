	Calcutta polices traffic diversion plan for the construction of a ramp on the AJC Bose Road flyover went horribly wrong on Day 1 with congestion on the substitute routes spilling over to other thoroughfares in town.        
	Commuters suffered all day as buses, minibuses and cars crawled through the arteries despite a large contingent of traffic police being deployed along the bottleneck stretch of AJC Bose Road, starting from the intersection with Rawdon Street.         
	This is only the first day, and we had expected some of these problems. Things can go wrong when something new is implemented. Wait for a few days and everything should fall into place, said Dilip Banerjee, the deputy commissioner of traffic police.        
	Work on the 425-metre ramp, taking off from a spot close to the AJC Bose Road-Theatre Road crossing, was postponed twice last year. According to engineers of Howrah River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC), which is implementing the project, it would take them at least a year to complete the north-bound ramp at the Beckbagan end of the flyover.        
	Forget a year, this traffic plan wont work even for a week. I wanted to reach Kala Mandir from the Exide crossing and was forced into a long-winding diversion through Rawdon Street, Park Street, AJC Bose Road and then turn in from Theatre Road. How much more ridiculous can this get? wondered Lopamudra Sen, stranded along with her two-year-old son.        
	Motorists complained about the lack of signage to guide them through the diversion routes. Boards mentioning the alternative routes were put up but they were so small that drivers at the wheel would have had to stop and stare for a few minutes to read the instructions. Most relied on the police personnel on duty to show them the way.         
	Couldnt they have figured out that nobody would be able to read the small signs while driving? asked a company official getting late for work.        
	Schoolchildren, mostly students of the La Martiniere schools, spent extra time in their school buses and those taking taxis to office had to pay more as vehicles heading towards Park Circus down AJC Bose Road ran into the traffic stream turning right towards Exide from Moulali.        
	Congestion soon spread to the Chowringhee intersection, Moulali and the seven-point Park Circus crossing, and the cops threw up their hands in despair.        
	For commuters stranded in the chaos zone on Tuesday, the most worrying part was that the police were clueless about how to handle the pressure that was building up every hour, said a businessman who has an office on AJC Bose Road.        
	The police had diverted all Salt Lake and New Town-bound buses down the AJC Bose Road flyover along with smaller vehicles, which is said to have compounded the chaos. With a large stretch of Lenin Sarani unable to take the load, buses heading for Sealdah from Esplanade had to be diverted down Ganesh Chandra Avenue to Nirmal Chandra Street before hitting Lenin Sarani to reach Moulali.         
	You cant dig out alternative routes; so this traffic diversion plan will have to be followed. We are arranging for bigger display boards to ensure that everyone notices and manages to read the instructions. These boards should be ready by Wednesday, said deputy commissioner Banerjee.        
	The Rs 28-crore ramp on the Beckbagan side is meant to maximise the use of the citys longest flyover. The ramp will stand on 12 pillars but work has begun on just four. Piling will begin in another three weeks, said Sadhan Banerjee, the vice-chairman of HRBC.

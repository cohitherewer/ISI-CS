The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bomb threat on campus
                                                                                                               Bomb threat on campus
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The main gate of the Indian Statistical Institute shut on Wednesday. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                  
	An email threatening to blow up the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) within 48 hours kept the Baranagar campus on tenterhooks on Wednesday.         
	The anonymous sender claimed his organisation, which he did not name, had planted bombs on the premises. If the explosion does not take place today, it will occur next day, states the email.        
	The day-long search for explosives on the campus spread over 1.5sq km by bomb squad personnel, however, drew a blank.         
	The police are trying to identify the computer from which the email was sent. The director of the ISI, Shankar Pal, saw it as soon as he signed into his email account around 10am on Wednesday.        
	The email was forwarded to 20 other officials. After informing the police, we searched the rooms and the grounds on our own but did not find anything, said an official of the institute.        
	The ISI authorities had to cancel scheduled meetings because of the email. We were involved in the search for explosives and hence, could not hold the meetings, said an official.        
	The gates of the hostels remained shut. We were asked not to step out of our rooms. I saw policemen surrounding the hostel building and searching it, said a student.        
	Senior officers at Lalbazar said the threat appeared to be a hoax. The sender neither identified himself nor disclosed the name of his organisation. This is making us suspect the authenticity of the email, said an officer.

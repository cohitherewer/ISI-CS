	Never trust fish. I woke in the morning with a plot clear in my mind. But we had some big orders and it wasnt till late night that I could return from the bheri. By then the stink of fish had driven out the plot, rued Sital Chandra Patra in his workshop diary. Patra, who runs a fishery in Amta, was one of the 21 selected to participate in the third Natya Akademi-sponsored playwriting workshop held from October 7 to 15 at Belilious Park in collaboration with the Howrah Municipal Corporation.         
	A few weeks ago each participant was asked to start writing a play, which would be completed at the workshop. The daily sessions (6am to 11pm) began with a reading of plays and discussions on technique. Everything here is aimed to help participants rediscover their own ideas, said playwright Manoj Mitra.         
	The young writers from Kakinada, Panshkura, Bali, Gobardanga, Calcutta and other places were bursting with ideas. In the village near Gangpur where Subhas Chandra Mondol lives, only a local group sometimes performs the palas I write. This, my first proscenium play, is on a jatra palakar, said Mondol. To Santhali writer Bangshi Badan Murmu from Burdwan, the classes were a revelation. Bhaskargata Pati of Midnapore wrote Matha Matha, from real-life experiences in the Maoist terrain.         
	The workshop was addressed by six playwrights: Mitra, Chandan Sen, Soumitra Basu, Tirthankar Chanda, Seema Mukherjee and Harimadhav Mukhopadhyay.

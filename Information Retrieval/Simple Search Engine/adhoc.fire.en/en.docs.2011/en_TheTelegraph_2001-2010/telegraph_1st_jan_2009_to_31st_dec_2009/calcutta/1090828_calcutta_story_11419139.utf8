                An Alipore court has directed Regent Park resident Soumen Basu to pay his aged parents Rs 5,000 every month as maintenance. Soumens father Debaprasad Basu, 81, had moved court on July 23 seeking maintenance from Soumen, his elder son. Soumen occupies the first floor of Debaprasads Regent Park house. The court also asked him to leave the house by September 30 or pay his father Rs 3,000 extra per month, said Debaprasads counsel Dipit Bose.    The body of Sutirtha Bhattacharya, 35, which was found near Kidderpore dock gate on Wednesday morning, was identified by his sister D. Sinha on Thursday. Sutirtha was a third-year student of the Rajiv Gandhi School of Intellectual Property Law at IIT Kharagpur. Police said it was a case of suicide.    A woman was detained at Sealdah station on Thursday for falsely claiming that a bomb had been planted on the Sealdah-New Delhi Rajdhani Express. Manjushree, 35, shouted that a bomb had been planted in one of the AC 3-tier coaches shortly after the train left at 4.40pm. The train was stopped and searched at Dankuni but nothing suspicious was found. Security officers said the woman had raised a false alarm because her luggage was in the train but her travel agent had not given her the ticket.    Metro Rail officials said on Thursday that all trains from Dum Dum would ply till Kavi Nazrul (Garia Bazar) station from Friday.    A young woman lodged a complaint with Shakespeare Sarani police against an employee of an event management firm on Moira Street alleging that he had blown cigarette smoke on her face on Thursday morning. Police said as an altercation broke out, some drivers of another office in the building intervened. That lead to a clash between the employees of the two offices.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | LiLo not a mean girl at midnight 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      LiLo not a mean girl at midnight 
  - I LEANED TOWARDS YOU, SHE SAID EVER SO SOFTLY          KARO CHRISTINE KUMAR                                                  
	It was past 11pm when I walked into Taj Bengals The Junction on Thursday with my friends. Glancing around, I spotted a blonde, petite and pretty, sitting with her legs neatly crossed. She and her two male friends had bagged the best seats in the lounge.        
	I looked at her twice, and then again, and then I needed no one to tell me that this was, indeed, the Lindsay Lohan.        
	Her now golden locks of long hair (she is known to change her hair colour as frequently as her boyfriends) hung loose and uneven over both shoulders. With arms tightly folded, she looked tiny and timid from where I sat.        
	Every now and then, Lilo was on the phone, smiling and chatting. She stood up once in between and I spotted the fashion icon wearing heeled boots, black leggings, a thin white top and an even thinner jacket. A scarf was draped around her neck.        
	After a while, she and her male friend rose to leave for a smoke upstairs. One of my friends and I followed.        
	Can we have your autograph please, we asked. Lindsay Lohan stubbed out her cigarette in The Haven lounge (open only to suite residents of Taj Bengal) and glanced up with a smile at us.        
	How do you know each other, she asked. Were friends, said my 27-year-old classmate from school.        
	Just friends? she quizzed with one eyebrow raised, as her hand reached out for the marker we had borrowed from the lobby receptionist.        
	Shes not my type, replied my friend and Lindsay broke into laughter but immediately took my side. Thats so mean, she said. But well, its okay because this is my friend (pointing at the man who was lighting up a cigarette next to her) and well, were not each others type at all!        
	Putting ink to the crisp white cloth napkin we had carried out from The Junction (with permission) she asked us how we spelt our names before writing them down. She signed off with a flourish, a heart trailing down one side.        
	How do you like Calcutta? I asked. We went to this place today where I met all these children  I love children  and they dont have homes because of the floods. I cant remember the name of the place its away from the city, she said.        
	It begins with S, her light-haired friend tried to help as we pitched in with suggestions from South Parganas to the Sunderbans.        
	Yes the Sunderbans, there was this trafficked girl there, I painted her nails and I even gave her my number if she wants to call me, she said.        
	I looked at the Mean Girls star and wondered how she could be as mean  and wild  as she is made out to be.        
	The tabloid queen of the the 3-F formula  flings (celeb men and women), films and (in)fame  even obliged us with a photograph (clicked with a mobile phone).        
	When my classmate threatened (in jest) to crop me out from the photograph of three, Lindsay laughed.        
	After the click, she told me ever so softly with a twinkle in her eye: I leaned towards you.        
	Yes, for a second, she had.

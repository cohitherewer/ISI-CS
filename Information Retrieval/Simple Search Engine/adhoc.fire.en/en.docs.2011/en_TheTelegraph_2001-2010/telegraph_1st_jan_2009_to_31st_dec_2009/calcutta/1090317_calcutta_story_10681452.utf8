	A dark room at Islamia Library in Rajabazar helps turn bright dreams into reality. Sitting in a corner, Faria Parvin claims she wants to be a nurse when she grows up. Her classmate Zeeshan Ahmed wants to teach slum children in future. Sitting a little ahead, Zubi Parveen aspires to be a policewoman, while Ishrat Parveen wants to win fame as a dancer. Faria, Ayesha, Ishrat, Zubi and several other slum children are being given special coaching at Islamia Library to help them with their school curriculum, as part of a corporate sustainability project of TCS. The Rajabazar-based project aims at educating underprivileged children and providing vocational training to women.        
	On February 26, the children gathered in their classroom to interact with Mala Ramadorai, the wife of S. Ramadorai, the CEO and founder of Maitree  TCSs employee engagement wing that has undertaken this project. Also present were the women who are undergoing training. To make the interaction fun-filled, the kids presented a short musical programme.        
	Mala Ramadorai stressed on a games-oriented approach to education rather than the chalk-and-talk method. Children can be made to play games on the computer, which would improve their mouse control, she explained.         
	Maitree works in coordination with Rajabazar Education and Awareness Development Society (READS). We have been working in the slums of Rajabazar for the past 10 years, said Sarfaraz Ali, the secretary of READS, which operates from five centres in Rajabazar.         
	They conduct tests in each centre and the most meritorious students are sent to Islamia Library for special coaching.         
	The TCS project is divided into various segments. Prayas imparts primary and computer education to children. Protsahan provides scholarships to meritorious students and helps them attend school. Sahyog provides vocational training to women.         
	Protsahan and Sahyog started in 2008, while Prayas dates back to July 2005. We sponsored the education of 32 children in the last academic session. Sometimes we face resistance from parents, who want their wards to earn a living rather than go to school. We try to counsel them but it does not always help, admits Kishan Gopal, the coordinator of Maitree.         
	Classes are held once a week and conducted by local teachers and TCS volunteers.

	It was a proud moment for the tots of Lakshmipat Singhania Academy. For a day, they felt like university students, with their hard work being recognised at a convocation organised in the school auditorium on March 5. Clasping their certificates tightly in their hands and tossing their convocation caps up in the air, these students of classes II and V made a pretty picture at the programme.         
	The event began with a song-and-dance performance by the students. The pre-school tots staged a puppet dance show for their seniors. It was also time to say goodbye to some teachers who wouldnt be teaching them any more. These kids bade them farewell in style, singing with their teachers and gifting them hand-made cards.        
	We want to inculcate a sense of responsibility in the students as they go from pre-primary to primary (Class II) and from primary to middle-school (Class V) levels. The convocation aims to make this transition smooth, said Meena Kak, the principal of the school.         
	The children looked excited and ready for the new phase in their lives. I cant wait to get into my new uniform and meet my new teachers. There will be a lot more activities in my new class. I feel grown up, gushed Madhusree Dasgupta of Class II.         
	Some parents rued the lack of such activities during their school days. When we were in school, we could never think of such innovative programmes. They prepare the kids for the future, said Rajesh Gupta, the parent of a Class V student, Kushagra Gupta.        
	The children did not forget the support staff of the school on their special day. They collected money and bought them gifts, as a token of their appreciation.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Evidence hurdle in student rape case 
                                                                                                               Evidence hurdle in student rape case 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Forensic experts are yet to find conclusive evidence of the alleged rape of a 21-year-old engineering student by three youths on February 8, sources said on Wednesday.        
	A forensic team visited the Santoshpur flat of two of the three accused  Tanmoy Mayukh Borai and Saptarshi Sanyal  where the girl said she had been sexually assaulted.        
	The team found no foreign bodies in the apartment. More than two weeks have passed since the alleged incident and the accused had lived there for a week before being arrested on February 15. The bed sheets might have been washed and the glasses cleaned, an officer investigating the case said.         
	The girl has accused Tanmoy, Saptarshi and Rishin Sengupta of raping her after calling her for a get-together and drugging her. The trio are in judicial custody.        
	A medical examination of the girl has indicated she was raped, a police source said. But the report does not provide conclusive evidence of rape, the source added.        
	Body fluids collected from the victim and the accused will be tested to ascertain the rape charge, an officer said.        
	The law says that in a rape case the victims statement is enough if there is circumstantial evidence. But since the girl was drugged she was unable to recollect most of what had happened, the officer said.        
	All the reports would be produced in court on March 2.

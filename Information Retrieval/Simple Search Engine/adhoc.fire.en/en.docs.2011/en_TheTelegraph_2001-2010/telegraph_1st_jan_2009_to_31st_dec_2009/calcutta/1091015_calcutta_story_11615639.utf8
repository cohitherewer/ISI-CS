The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Duo in net for card fraud
                                                                                                               Duo in net for card fraud
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two men engaged by a number of banks for credit card-related services allegedly used the particulars of a cardholder to cheat him of Rs 31,000.        
	Indranil Tarafdar, 29, and Suman Bagchi, 28, were arrested in their Barasat homes on Wednesday.        
	The two run a telecalling centre in Dum Dum. They had collected the credit card details of a trader in south Calcutta and cheated him. We will find out if the duo had duped others as well, said city detective chief Damayanti Sen.        
	According to a preliminary probe, Tarafdar and Bagchi had set up the centre early this year primarily to check credentials of credit card applicants on behalf of client banks. The centre also markets various services to cardholders on behalf of banks.        
	Cops claimed that the two used the credit card details of J.S. Chaudhury, a resident of Sarat Bose Road, to buy a DTH service and software on the Internet.         
	The online purchases were made in July. Chaudhury found out about them after getting the credit card statement for the month. He immediately contacted the detective department, said an officer.        
	The investigators zeroed in on the two by tracking the Internet protocol (IP) address of the computer used to make the online purchases.        
	The police said Tarafdar and Bagchi would call up cardholders and try to determine whether they were aware of the dos and donts before attempting to sweet-talk them into revealing the details of their cards.        
	They would even find out the cardholders profession before stealing from him, said an investigator.        
	There have been occasions when cardholders have refused to divulge their card details to the two. The duo wouldnt call these cardholders back fearing police complaints, added the officer.

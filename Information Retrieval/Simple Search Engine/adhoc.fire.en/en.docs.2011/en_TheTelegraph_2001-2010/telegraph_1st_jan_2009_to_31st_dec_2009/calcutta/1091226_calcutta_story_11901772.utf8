	Circus has returned to Park Circus Maidan after two winters.         
	Ajanta Circus, which has put up tents on the ground, started its shows on Thursday. The troupe of 300, including a band of 11 gymnasts from Russia and Africa, is slated to perform till the first week of February. Elephants, horses, dogs and exotic birds are the other attractions.        
	In 2007-08, the civic authorities had kept the ground  a seat of circuses since the British era  free for the Book Fair, which was eventually held in the Salt Lake stadium compound.        
	The following winter, circus tents were not allowed on the ground for the temporary rehabilitation of stall owners of Park Circus Market. According to civic sources, Ajanta Circus paid over Rs 11 lakh for hiring the ground for 45 days, against a reserve price of Rs 5 lakh.        
	The manager of the circus, Khondakar Abu Salem, said over Rs 6 lakh was spent on setting up the tents and the daily expense of the three shows was over Rs 60,000.

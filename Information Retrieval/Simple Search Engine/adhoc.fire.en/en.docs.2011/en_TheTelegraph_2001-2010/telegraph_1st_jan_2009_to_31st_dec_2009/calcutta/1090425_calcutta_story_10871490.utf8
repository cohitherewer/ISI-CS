The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Court order on hotel in park
                                                                                                               Court order on hotel in park
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Friday ordered the state environment department to file an affidavit stating what had prompted it to issue a no-objection certificate to a private body for constructing a hotel inside Swabhumi, a heritage park on the EM Bypass.        
	The division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice B. Somadder also asked the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) to file an affidavit stating how it had sanctioned the plan for the hotel on a plot leased out for the construction of a heritage park.         
	The order was passed on a petition moved last year by city-based social organisation Forum for Human Legal and Ecological Rights. It claimed that the construction of the hotel in the park would affect the environment.        
	Moreover, the decision to construct the hotel inside the park was contrary to the provisions laid down in the agreement that the CMC had made with Ganapati Parks Limited, which set up Swabhumi, before handing over the plot, said the petitioner.         
	When the matter first came up for hearing, the lawyer representing Ganapati Parks had said the construction of the hotel would not affect the quality of air in the area. He had also claimed that the agreement had the provision for developing tourism in the state and setting up the hotel was a step in that direction.        
	The matter is slated to come up for hearing in June.

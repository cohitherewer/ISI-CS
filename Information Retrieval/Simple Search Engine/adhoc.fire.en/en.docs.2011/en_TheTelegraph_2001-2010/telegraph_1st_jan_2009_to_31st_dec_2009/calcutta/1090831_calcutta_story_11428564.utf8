                                                                                                               Zoo awaits monkeys
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	The marmosets stolen from Alipore zoo and rescued in Durg, Chhattisgarh, will return home soon.        
	Zoo director Raju Das said the seven marmosets  one of them died in captivity  were being kept in a Bhilai Steel Plant zoo till their travel plans were finalised.         
	We are arranging for their transportation to Calcutta. Our officers and police are working out the modalities. It will be difficult to bring them by train, so most probably they will be flown down on Monday evening or Tuesday morning, Das told Metro on Sunday.        
	Security arrangements have been revamped and a new enclosure will be built to house the recovered marmosets, said a zoo official.        
	Calcutta police are awaiting the arrival of Raj Saikia, who was arrested in Chhattisgarh on Friday in connection with the theft of the Common Marmosets.        
	Based on the information Saikia provided during interrogation, his alleged associate, Sujoy Das, a 31-year-old Dum Dum resident also known as Babai, was arrested by the city police on Saturday. Das was remanded in police custody till September 8.        
	Babai holds the key to the case and our officers are interrogating him to know how many people were involved in the theft, said an officer of the detective department.        
	Saikia said Babai had helped him transport the monkeys from Calcutta to Chhattisgarh, added the officer.        
	The rare monkeys  the size of large rats and worth around Rs 1 lakh each in the illicit wildlife market  were stolen on August 9.         
	Saikia had planned to leave Durg with the monkeys on Monday for Pune in search of buyers, claimed the crime branch in-charge of Durg police, Naresh Patel.        
	According to the police, the 33-year-old was working in a factory in Durg for two years. The seven stolen marmosets and the body of the eighth were found in his house in Sarona.        
	We received a tip-off that Saikia was trying to sell marmosets and laid a trap for him, said the Durg police superintendent, Deepanshu Kabra.

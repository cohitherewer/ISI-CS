                                                                                                               Fuzzy clues to cops death
  - Probe team rules out link with Rizwanur case        A STAFF REPORTER                          Arindam Manna                                        
	Railway police officer Arindam Mannas death on a rail track remained cloaked in mystery as conspiracy theories were spun around his alleged run-ins with seniors, unconfirmed reports of political pressure and possible problems in his personal life.         
	The only thing police seemed sure about was that there was no connection between the young sub-inspectors death and the Rizwanur Rahman case, in which he was the first investigating officer.         
	He was found dead on a rail track, just like Rizwanur was one and a half years ago, and it looks like suicide. The similarity ends there, said an officer of the Criminal Investigation Department, which has taken over the case.         
	Arindams father Ashok had filed a complaint with Dasnagar Investigation Centre in Howrah, accusing Rizwanurs father-in-law Ashok Todi and his sons immediate boss, Manas Chakraborty, of being responsible for the alleged murder.         
	The sub-inspectors body was found beheaded near Mankundu railway station, in Hooghly district, on Wednesday.         
	Sources said the focus of the investigation was the Manna familys statements on Arindams mental state in the days leading to his death. He was on sick leave since Monday but went to the Dum Dum office of the Government Railway Police (GRP), where he was posted, on Tuesday. He had called home thrice between 9.30pm that day and 1.40am on Wednesday, the first time to ask his parents to destroy the papers related to their house in Dasnagar.         
	He had taken a loan to build the single-storey house.         
	Soma Senapati, Arindams sister-in-law, told the police that he had spoken to her about being harassed by Chakraborty for no reason. Arindam also told Soma that a section of political leaders from Dum Dum could land him in trouble. He said he would disclose the names of the political leaders on February 22, an officer said, quoting from her statement.         
	Chakraborty had confirmed to Arindams family before his body was found that he visited the Dum Dum GRP station on Tuesday. He said the sub-inspector came to beg for forgiveness but wouldnt say for what.         
	A three-member CID team interrogated Chakraborty and other officers on Thursday. The officials also checked the general diary and Arindams leave records.         
	Chakraborty denied harassing Arindam. He was directly recruited as a sub-inspector and was closer to me than others in this police station, he said.         
	Arindams colleagues said he looked very depressed for around a fortnight before going on leave. Arindam was a strict officer and used to take on criminal elements operating on railway platforms, irrespective of their political connections. But he never discussed his professional problems, if any, with us, a colleague said.         
	The sub-inspector was supposed to get married to a girl chosen by his family in April. Investigators are trying to find out whether a personal problem led to depression. We have traced another girl who knew Arindam well but have yet to confirm whether they were a couple or just friends, an officer said.         
	Special inspector-general Sanjay Mukherjee led a CID team to Arindams Dasnagar house to search his room but the family requested them to come on Friday.         
	Apart from Arindams professional and personal life, the CID intends investigating his familys assets and their source.         
	We are through with the first day of the probe but it is too early to point a finger at anything, said P. Nirajnayan, the inspector-general (II) of police, CID.

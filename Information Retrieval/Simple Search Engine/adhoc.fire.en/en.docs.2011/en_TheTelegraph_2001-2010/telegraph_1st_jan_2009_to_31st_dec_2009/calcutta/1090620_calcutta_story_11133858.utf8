The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Weekend of power woes and sweat
                                                                                                               Weekend of power woes and sweat
          A STAFF REPORTER                                              Street lights near Akashvani Bhawan remained switched on in broad daylight even as the rest of the city suffered power cuts because of a shortfall on Friday. Picture by Aranya Sen      
	The citys discomfort factor soared on Friday, with the CESC helplines going blank even as power cuts continued and the weather stayed sultry. The helplines would be alive and ringing this weekend, but there is no respite in sight from either the power cuts or the heat and humidity.        
	A fire in the IBM call centre that operates the helplines 1912 and 4403-1912 from Millennium Tower 2 in Sector V was responsible for the numbers remaining unresponsive for the better part of the day. One of the helplines was restored by 6pm, but CESCs problems with its generation and distribution units continued.        
	If Friday brought power cuts for 60-90 minutes in most localities by rotation, the weekend could be worse, a bulletin warned. The Townsend Road distribution station in south Calcutta requires urgent maintenance, for which it will be shut down on Saturday morning. That means power cuts between 9am and 1pm in all CESC-served areas in the south, an official said.        
	Although the official duration of rotational power cuts did not exceed 90 minutes on Friday, residents of some areas complained of longer periods of loadshedding.        
	No-rain Friday witnessed a maximum temperature of 35.6 degree Celsius, two points above normal and a maximum humidity of 94 per cent.        
	The normal monsoon flow is still three to four days away from activation. This weekend would be hot and humid. The only relief could come in the form of isolated thunderstorms over south Bengal caused by abundant moisture, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	The weatherman did hold out hope for next week. The gradual strengthening of the monsoon current over the Bay of Bengal might rejuvenate the monsoon towards the middle of next week.

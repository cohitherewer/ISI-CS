                      Magical landscapes                    Traditionally, landscape art depicts nature in its various geographical elements as perceived by the artist. They include the beautiful, awe-inspiring and terrifying aspects of nature, with its sun and rain, snow and hail, floods and avalanches. Mountains and plains, rivers and valleys, forests and fields, all fall within the purview of landscape painting. Early in the 15th century, landscape painting was established as a genre in Europe, as a setting for human activity, and even expressed in a religious vein. The paintings of Ramakrishna Behera are most certainly landscapes and are inspired by real places: the caves of Ajanta, the mountains and monasteries of Ladakh, the countryside of Orissa and even the interior of the artists own home. Yet his works employ distorted perspectives and folds as found in images of outer space, to resemble something more like psychological maps or hallucinatory visions. While the palette of colours that Behera uses is realistic, their spaces definitely are not. The surfaces of his paintings are buttery and their details are seemingly coaxed spontaneously from their making. The ongoing maiden solo show by this self-taught artist features some of his outstanding, most recent paintings.

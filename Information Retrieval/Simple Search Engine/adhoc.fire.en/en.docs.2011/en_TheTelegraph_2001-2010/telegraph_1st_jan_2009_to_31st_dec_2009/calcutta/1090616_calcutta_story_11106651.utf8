The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cases pile up as judges few
                                                                                                               Cases pile up as judges few
  - 1 appointment in 6 months          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                                                  
	Over 40,000 cases have piled on the lakhs of pending cases in Calcutta High Court since the beginning of the year because of inadequate number of judges.         
	There should be at least 58 judges in Calcutta High Court. But the court is operating with only 30 judges. Six months ago, a three-judge committee of the court had recommended 13 names to the Supreme Court for appointment as judges. The apex court forwarded the list to the Centre, which has appointed only one judge from the list, said a senior official in the state law department.        
	The delay in appointment of judges has frustrated the lawyers. We have made at least six representations either to the Union law ministry or the Supreme Court, stating the difficulties of the high court because of judge posts lying vacant. Each time we were told that appointments would be made immediately, a senior member of the high court bar association said.         
	The functioning of the court is being hampered by the shortage of judges. Writ petitions under Section 226 of the IPC (curbing fundamental rights of a person) are heard only in the high court. These cases are not being heard for years, Sailendu Rakshit, an advocate of the court, said.        
	Members of the National Lawyers Association blamed the state government for shortage of judges. The Left Front government does not want new judges in the court since they have been criticised at every step by the judiciary, said advocate Subroto Mukherjee.        
	Through a letter to the Union ministry, the chief minister had challenged the credentials of four advocates whose names were recommended to the Supreme Court for appointment as judges. The allegations were found baseless after investigation, he added.         
	The Bar Association president, Bidyut Kiran Mukherjee, said: Shortage of judges has severely affected the functioning of the court. Many of our members want to cease work demanding filing up of the vacant posts. But as the Supreme Court had banned strike by lawyers, we cannot take the path.

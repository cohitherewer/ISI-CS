The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fatal mishap in Sec V
                                                                                                               Fatal mishap in Sec V
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Subir Bose                                  
	A 35-year-old man walking down a road in Salt Lake Sector V was crushed to death by a speeding bus on Monday morning, highlighting once again the need for sidewalks in the showpiece tech hub.        
	Family sources said Subir Bose, an accountant of Sector V-based pharmaceutical company SAF Fermion Ltd, was walking towards the JK Saha bridge from the College More when the bus on route 201 mowed him down behind the Techno India campus.        
	The driver and conductors fled leaving behind the bus, said an officer of the Sector V police outpost.        
	Witnesses said the bus, moving at a high speed, suddenly swerved to the left and knocked down the resident of Garia, who was walking along the edge of the road.        
	We receive reports of at least 15 cases of hit and run on Sector V roads every month. Todays accident might have been averted had there been a footpath, said another officer of the outpost.        
	Mondays accident prompted officials of the Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority, the administrative body of Sector V, to turn their focus on the lack of footpaths.        
	Pavements are badly needed in Sector V where the pedestrian population is rising steadily. We have decided to start eviction of hawkers who encroach on the areas slotted for pavements. The sidewalks will be made concrete once work on sewer lines is over, said S.A. Ahmed, the chairman of the authority.        
	Family members of Bose, however, blamed the mishap on the management of SAF Fermion which they alleged had slapped a false charge of forgery on him.        
	He was falsely charged with embezzling Rs 12,90,000, said Boses wife Banasree, who has filed an FIR against five senior officials of the company. Subir was very depressed. He reached Sector V on time but instead of entering office, where he feared he would be humiliated, he was roaming around, said another relative.        
	The company, however, denied the charge. We have documents to prove that he had misplaced the funds. We tried to settle the matter without involving the police and asked his wife to join our company so the couple could pay back the debt together, said Anindya Ghosh, the executive assistant to the managing director.        
	Bose left behind a five-year-old son.

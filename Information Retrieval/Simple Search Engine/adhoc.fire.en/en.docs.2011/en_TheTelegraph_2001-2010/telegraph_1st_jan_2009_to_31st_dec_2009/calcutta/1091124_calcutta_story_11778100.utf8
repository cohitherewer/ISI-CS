                      Union of art forms                    As part of an ongoing process to bring together on the same platform different artistes practising different art forms, Weavers Studio Centre for the Arts presents a 100-minute-long evening of music and dance which aims to harmonise and unite its different expressions. The Art of Improvisation showcases the parallel existence of traditional art and improvisation. In it, each artiste will retain his or her originality and also reach out to explore territories beyond, at the same time providing a one-to-one discourse of each artiste with the rich Indian heritage of music and dance through his/her own medium of expression. The first 45 minutes will be an expression of the art form of young Bharata Natyam dancer Arupa Lahiri, the way she perceives it in its unadulterared form. This will be followed by a session of purely instrumental jazz-fusion by Kendraka, featuring tabla player Saradindu Adhikary. A power-packed concert displaying contemporary urban metamorphosis of musical influences, it will feature original tracks by Kendraka duo Mainak Bumpy Nag Chowdhury and Bodhisattwa Ghosh, with tribute to greats like Miles Davis, John Coltrane and Billy Cowham.                  Event: A programme of contemporary fusion music with Bharata Natyam When: Today; 6 pm - 7.40 pm Where: Weavers Studio Centre for the Arts, 94 Ballygunge Place

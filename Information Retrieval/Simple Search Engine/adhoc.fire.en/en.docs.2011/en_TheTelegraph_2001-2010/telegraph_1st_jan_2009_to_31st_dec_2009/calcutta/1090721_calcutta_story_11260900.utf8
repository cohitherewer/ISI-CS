The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Brace for traffic-stopper today
                                                                                                               Brace for traffic-stopper today
          OUR BUREAU                              
	The Calcutta commuter is set to be the martyr on Trinamul Congresss Martyrs Day with Mamata Banerjees supporters straining at the leash to turn Tuesdays event into a belated victory rally.        
	Red was the signal everywhere in town on the eve of the green brigades largest congregation since the Lok Sabha poll, to be held in front of Victoria House in central Calcutta from noon.         
	If Thursday (when Congress activists rampaged through the streets) was a torture and Friday (when the Congress clamped a bandh) a forced holiday, Tuesday could trigger traffic tumult, warned a police officer.         
	The buzz in Lalbazar was that at least 10 of the citys thoroughfares would be clogged from morning till evening despite the elaborate bandobast to keep traffic moving and trouble at bay.         
	Metro compiles a disruption dossier to help citizens get through their third trial by blockade, bandh or rally brigade in less than a week.        
	CHOKE ZONES        
	Steer clear of JL Nehru Road, Central Avenue, Brabourne Road, Strand Road, AJC Bose Road (particularly near Moulali), Rani Rashmoni Avenue and Kidderpore Road.        
	A 3,000-strong police contingent will be deployed to control traffic and maintain law and order, but officers admit they can do little if more than two lakh people gather in one place.         
	The venue of the rally doesnt have the space to accommodate such a crowd, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).         
	So, what should the Calcuttan who has no choice but to step out of home do to avoid the rally rush?        
	 After a point, even smaller roads like Nirmal Chandra Street, Amherst Street and Theatre Road will be overflowing with traffic. We suggest that office-goers head for the nearest Metro station, said an IPS officer entrusted with mission impossible: managing traffic on Tuesday.         
	If you are driving, tune in to an FM channel on your stereo player. Lalbazar has promised to keep citizens updated about traffic congestion through most channels.                
	SCHOOL ON-OFF        
	Dont step out of home if you arent s ure you can bypass the chaos at the city centre and the car crawl all around  thats the message from schools to students.        
	Several schools have declared an optional day off, some have announced truncated classes, and a few have advised students to take into account the traffic situation before venturing out. Our principal told us during the assembly on Monday that those of us who face transport problems need not come to school on Tuesday. For those who can come, classes will be held normally till 1.20pm, said a Class VII student of La Martiniere for Girls.         
	Classes at Calcutta Girls High School will give over at 10.55am instead of 1.45pm. Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School has declared a holiday for its junior section (till Class IV).         
	The junior school gives over at 12.30pm, and we dont want 1,300-odd children getting stuck somewhere on the way back home, said principal Malini Bhagat.        
	Calcutta Boys School, on SN Banerjee Road, will start at 7.30am and give over at 9.45am instead of noon. Students from nursery till Class II have been given a holiday. Birla High School for Boys and Girls will have normal classes but might not object if parents want to take their children home at midday.                 
	JAM PLUS EXAM         
	Undergraduate and postgraduate examinations of Calcutta University are slated for Tuesday, but till late on Monday there was no indication about a postponement despite examinees likely to be caught in snarls. All examinations will be held according to schedule, said the controller of the examination department of the university.                
	OFFICE ORDEAL        
	Office-goers must bear the brunt of Tuesdays traffic pain. A rally in the heart of the city is just as disruptive as a protest or a bandh but employers dont accept it as an excuse to stay away from work, said Saibal Saha, an employee of a private company whose office is in Dalhousie.        
	So, the options are to either report sick or set out of home before the Trinamul army starts converging on the heart of the city. And, yes, be prepared to reach home later than usual.                
	SORRY, BUT        
	Mamata Banerjee has apologised in advance for the hardship that citizens could face because of her rally, dedicated to Maa, Mati and Manush.         
	The party claims to have laid out elaborate traffic and people-management plans to minimise disruption. We have distributed stickers of different colours to buses coming from different places, a Trinamul activist said.        
	Party leader Bobby Hakim denied that Martyrs Day would turn into Victory Day. We are still far from celebrating victory. We will do it after winning the Assembly polls, he said.                
	RAIN RESPITE        
	The Met office has forecast heavy rain over the next 48 hours, which means showers could dampen the Trinamul show and lessen the chaos.

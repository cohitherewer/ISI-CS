The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Torment for tease victim
                                                                                                               Torment for tease victim
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 30-year-old woman who had dragged her tormentor to police waited in vain at Bankshall court on Friday for the accused to turn up for an identification parade.        
	It was frustrating. I waited from 11.30am to 2.30pm but the man did not come, said Shreyasee Bhaduri.        
	The accused, Sheikh Sagir of Kidderpore, was released on bail the day after being arrested on May 10. The court had ordered him to turn up on Friday for the identification parade.        
	Sagirs conduct is unacceptable. We will plead with the court to issue an arrest warrant against him. As soon as the warrant is out, he will be arrested and brought to the court, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police (detective department).        
	Asked whether the cops could have ensured Sagirs presence in the court on Friday, Shamim said there was little his men could have done as the accused was on bail and was supposed to come to the court and stand trial on his own.        
	Accused are granted bail on the condition that they would appear before the police or court whenever asked to.        
	Harassment faced by complainants because of non-appearance of accused on bail is quite common in courts.        
	I heard from people in the court that many are forced to go through the same ordeal as me. Just because my case is slightly unusual, it is being highlighted, Bhaduri said on Friday evening.        
	The woman, however, has not lost patience and is determined to fight till the end.        
	I will fight till I get justice. I am hopeful and have faith in our judicial system.... I am no hero. I want every woman teased, abused or molested to hit back like I did.        
	The working woman was walking down the Metro channel around 1.30pm on May 10 when she spotted a drunk Sagir approaching her, mouthing obscenities and making vulgar gestures.        
	She shouted at the man, chased him down and grabbed him by the collar. Sagir tried to escape but was caught by a traffic sergeant, who arranged for a vehicle to take him and the victim to Hare Street police station. Sagir was arrested after Bhaduri lodged a complaint.

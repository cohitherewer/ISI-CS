The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fatal fall from bus footboard 
                                                                                                               Fatal fall from bus footboard 
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A young man standing on the footboard of a private bus fell and was crushed under the rear wheels while trying to get off the vehicle at the Strand Road-Auckland Road crossing on Sunday afternoon.        
	Mohammed Kamal, 23, died less than 48 hours after a passenger on the footboard of a bus trying to overtake another was crushed to death between the two vehicles at Kidderpore.        
	A preliminary investigation has revealed that Kamal was on the front footboard of the bus. He wanted to alight at the bus stop near the crossing but the driver did not slow down, said an investigating officer at Hare Street police station.        
	The accident occurred around 3.30pm.        
	The absence of policemen and less traffic than usual on that stretch allowed the rogue driver to speed off after the accident. A witness noted down the registration number and gave it to the police.         
	We are trying to contact the owner, the officer said.        
	He quoted passengers waiting at the bus stop as saying that the driver took a sharp left turn, causing Kamal to lose his balance and fall. There were close to 20 passengers on the bus, the officer said.        
	Kamal, a resident of Mehndibagan at Taltala, was taken to SSKM Hospital, where doctors declared him dead. A family member reached the hospital later and identified the body.        
	On Friday evening, a private bus travelling from Howrah to Pailan recklessly overtook another bus on the same route and three men standing on the footboard were caught between the vehicles.         
	One of the passengers died before reaching SSKM Hospital.

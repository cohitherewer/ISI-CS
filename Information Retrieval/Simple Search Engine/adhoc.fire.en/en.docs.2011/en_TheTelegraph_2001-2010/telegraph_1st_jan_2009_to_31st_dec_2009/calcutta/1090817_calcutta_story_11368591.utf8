                      Saying with flowers                    Flowers have an expression of countenance as much as men or animals. Some seem to smile; some have a sad expression; some are pensive and diffident; others again are plain, honest and upright, like the broad-faced sunflower and the hollyhock. ~Henry Ward Beecher        Shyamal Sen, a contemporary of Ganesh Pyne, Ganesh Haloi and Suchibrata Deb, was a late entrant into the realm of art, but within a short span he has carved a niche for himself. A romantic to the core, Sens harmonious world revolves around nature and human beings, and he loves to express himself in transparent watercolours, a medium he has mastered commendably well. Sens paintings are all about light. Something that particularly excites a viewer about transparent watercolours is the way in which light is expressed. In contrast to other media, the effects of light are not painted. They are revealed. That is to say, in transparent watercolours, the available light reflecting off the painting surface is what creates the sense of luminosity. The artist leaves the white of the background material, or tints it in various ways, providing value contrasts, setting up colour relationships and letting colours blend. Taken together, these brush-strokes reveal the moment, character and effect of light. The 15 canvases on display currently bear witness to the fact that nature appeals to him in all its resplendent bounty. We find expression of infinity in his works. His art is a conversation with himself and also with the nature around him to institute a form in the formlessness. Force, dynamism and lyricism are the salient features that he etches out through his treatment, thereby unfolding the mystery dormant in life and nature.

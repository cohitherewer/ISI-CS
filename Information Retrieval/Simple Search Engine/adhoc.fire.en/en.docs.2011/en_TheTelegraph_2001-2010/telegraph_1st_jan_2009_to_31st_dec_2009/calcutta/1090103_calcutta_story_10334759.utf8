                                                                                                               Boy in ball hunt drowns in building manhole
          A STAFF REPORTER                          A photograph of Sriram Baid (during a holiday on a beach) from the family album                                  
	A seven-year-old boy in pursuit of a cricket ball on the premises of the housing complex he lived in fell into an open manhole and drowned in an underground reservoir.        
	An hour had passed before a plumber finally managed to fish out Sriram Baid from the reservoir of Topsias Brindavan Gardens housing estate on Friday afternoon.        
	Neighbours rushed him to National Medical College and Hospital, where the Class II student of St James School was declared dead on arrival.        
	The boy lived with his businessman father Vineet, mother Poonam, a one-year-old brother, their grandparents and an uncle.        
	Residents, who alleged that they were unaware of the existence of the open manhole leading to an underground reservoir in a dark chamber under a raised platform, lodged a complaint with Topsia police station accusing the developer, Christopher Housing Developers Private Limited, of negligence.                    The dark chamber leading to the open manhole into which Sriram fell. (Amit Datta)        
	Amarnath Saraf, the head of the Diamond Group consortium of which Christopher Housing is a member, said: The incident is unfortunate. Ill have to check whether there has been negligence on our part.        
	The raised platform over the reservoir was built before Durga puja, added Saraf.        
	Sriram  fondly referred to as Gopal by the family  left his third-floor flat in Brindavan Gardens around 11am to play cricket with his friends.        
	Five or six boys were playing in a driveway of the estate when the ball disappeared into a dark chamber. Sriram went looking for the ball so that the game could resume.        
	When he did not come back even after 10 minutes, his friends started shouting for help, said Ajay Malhotra, a resident of the estate.        
	After little Sriram was fished out of the reservoir, neighbours informed his uncle about the accident. They then called his father Vineet, who was in his Canning Street office, and took the boy to the hospital. Mother Poonam was told about the tragedy much later.        
	We had no idea that there was a manhole inside the chamber. It is so dark there that nothing could be seen. Many children in the estate play hide-and-seek there, said Bijay Poddar, a neighbour of the Baids.        
	Residents blamed the developers for the tragedy. There are open drains and manholes across the complex. We had complained to the developer but nothing was done, said Poddar.        
	Malhotra alleged that the child could have been saved had there been more security guards around. Some residents complained about the absence of a playground which forced the children to play in driveways.        
	Reacting to the residents complaint, an officer of Topsia police station said: We have started a probe and will find out whether the death of the boy was caused by negligence. Preliminary investigation suggests that the civic records of the housing estate are in order.

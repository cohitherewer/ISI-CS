The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Favourite city of favourite people
                                                                                                               Favourite city of favourite people
          PRATIM D. GUPTA                          Deepa Mehta in town on Thursday to promote her next film, Videsh. Picture by Aranya Sen                                  
	Her favourite filmmaker is from here. Her favourite writer is from here. No wonder it was a happy Deepa Mehta dropping into Calcutta after five-six years on Thursday and talking about a film very close to her heart.        
	The Oscar-nominated director, whose last film Water made it to the final five at the Academy Awards two years ago, was in town to talk about her new film Videsh  Heaven on Earth, starring Preity Zinta as a victim of domestic abuse.         
	Calcutta has always been my favourite city, Deepa told Metro. There are many reasons. Of course, some of the best filmmakers are from here My personal favourite is Ritwik Ghatak. Then theres Satyajit Ray and Mrinal Sen and now Rituparno Ghosh and Aparna Sen. Also, what moves me are the writers with a Calcutta connection. Theres Jhumpa Lahiri, of course, but my favourite is Amitav Ghosh.        
	Some day Deepa hopes to come to Calcutta and shoot a film. I would love to make a film here its an extremely fertile ground for creativity. Maybe something like Sea of Poppies  I loved the book. I also liked Amitavs The Hungry Tide but Sea of Poppies takes it to another level.        
	For now, she is busy scripting the screen adaptation of Salman Rushdies Midnight Children.        
	I am very excited about the film. Its great fun working with Salman because he is not only an exceptional writer but he has a great sense of humour. We will collaborate throughout on the film. First of all, we will spend six weeks together and get the script ready. Both Salman and me want to finish the script first and then give it to a mini studio. That way we have the control. The script stage is the most important as far as I am concerned. Once you have the script, the basic foundation is done, stresses Deepa.        
	What about the cast, apart from Shabana Azmi and Nandita Das? There are three young men (for the role of Saleem Sinai) I am very interested in. I will be auditioning them, she reveals.

                      Moral decadence of society        A political satire written in the form of a historical drama, Vijay Tendulkars celebrated Marathi play Ghasiram Kotwal is based on the life of Nana Phadnavis, one of the most prominent ministers in the court of the Peshwa of Pune in the 18th century. It depicts how men in power give rise to ideologies to serve their own purposes and later destroy them when they become useless. Its story begins with an invocation to Lord Ganesha. The Peshwa empire is run by the ageing, but extremely ruthless debauchee, Nana Phadnavis. The Brahmins, who have the run of the city, are a licentious lot, with their days equally divided between bhajans and lascivious tamashas, temples and gambling dens, pious wives and dancing girls.Ghasiram Kotwal, a poor Kannauj Brahmin from Aurangabad, comes to the city but is insulted and thrown out of Pune on false charges. He vows revenge and returns with his daughter, who he uses as a bait to secure the post of Kotwal or city magistrate. He lets loose a regime of rigorous moral policing in the city. He cracks down on brothels, raids homes to catch adulterers, stops money-spinning rackets and punishes the smallest crime of corruption with torture and death. The Brahmins of Pune rise up against the Kotwal. Nana now has no use for Ghasiram as he has already fulfilled his need of the latters daughter. Ghasiram is put to a painful death. The regime survives  and Pune returns to its colourful, venal ways. To be staged this evening by NSD Repertory Company, Delhi as part of Nandikars 26th National Theatre Festival.

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Friday ordered the state government to remove the national emblem from the cars of dignitaries who are not entitled to display it.         
	The division bench of acting Chief Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya and Justice P. Mandal passed the order after a petitioners lawyer told the court that the South 24-Parganas district judge was displaying the Ashok Stambha and the legend Satyameva Jayate on his car though he was not entitled to do so. Even the chief justice of India and the Prime Minister do not have the right to use the national emblem, said the lawyer.        
	According to a home ministry circular on October 4, 2007, only the President, the Vice-President, the governors and the lieutenant-governors of Union Territories, visiting heads of state and visiting Vice-Presidents are entitled to display the national emblem on their cars.        
	The lawyer claimed: The Constitution allows the chief justice of India and his colleague judges, the Prime Minister and his cabinet colleagues, the speaker and the deputy speaker of the Lok Sabha and the chairperson of the Rajya Sabha to display the Ashok Chakra (which is a part of the emblem).        
	The chief ministers, their cabinet colleagues and the speakers and deputy speakers of the Assemblies also have the right to display the Ashok Chakra, said the lawyer.        
	Kamal Kumar De had moved the plea, alleging that the national emblem was being used without the legend Satyameva Jayate.

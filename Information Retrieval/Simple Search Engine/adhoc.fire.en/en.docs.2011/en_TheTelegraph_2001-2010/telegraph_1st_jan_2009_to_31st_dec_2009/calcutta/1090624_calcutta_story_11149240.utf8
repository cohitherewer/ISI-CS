  Depression threat hovers          A STAFF REPORTER                                                  
	The possibility of a cyclonic circulation has raised hopes of monsoon rain from Thursday, exactly a month after cyclone Aila had dragged a premature and weak monsoon into the state.        
	The weatherman added a rider though, saying a depression over the Arabian Sea could play spoilsport and further prolong the spell of heat and humidity the city has been wilting under for the past few weeks.        
	There is a possibility of revival of the monsoon current in these parts on Thursday, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre, in Alipore.        
	Ever since its premature arrival on May 25 in the wake of Aila, the monsoon has stayed dormant. If it does get activated on Thursday, it would be after a gap of 30 days.        
	Debnath said a cyclonic formation could develop over the Bay of Bengal and move towards the state coast, activating the monsoon flow and pushing its northern limit further into the mainland.        
	The official, however, warned that a depression over the Arabian Sea could intensify, weakening the formation over the Bay and preventing the monsoon current from being activated.        
	The activation on Thursday is a possibility but we must not get too excited. If the depression becomes strong it could hinder the formation and progress of the cyclonic formation over the Bay. That would mean more days of such heat, said Debnath.        
	On Tuesday, the maximum temperature was 36.7 degree Celsius, three points above normal. The minimum was 29.5, two degrees above normal.        
	With the humidity ranging between 94 and 61 per cent, the days discomfort index remained at Mondays level of 66 degree Celsius, 11 points above normal.        
	There is little respite in sight on Wednesday, which is likely to be as hot and humid as the first two working days of the week.        
	The sky may be partly cloudy with possibility of development of thunderclouds towards evening or night, said an official.        
	Heat stroke cloud        
	A 55-year-old man died at Calcutta airport on Tuesday evening, with doctors suspecting heat stroke to be the cause.        
	Dharmnath Prasad, a driver of a private company, came to drop someone at the airport around 5.30pm.        
	The domestic airport manager was informed that the driver had fallen ill and doctors were immediately sent to the spot, said an official. After examining him, the doctors pronounced him dead.        
	He died at the wheel. According to preliminary findings, he had suffered cardiac arrest probably after heat stroke, the official added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | January session from 2012
                                                                                                               January session from 2012
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The state government has decided to gradually revert to the January-December academic session in primary and secondary schools.        
	The session will start in March in 2010, February in 2011 and January in 2012. Now, schools under the state board follow the April-March session.        
	The decision to revert to the pre-1989 session was finalised at a meeting school education minister Partha De held with officials of his department on Monday.        
	The schools will need some time to revert to the old system. So the government has decided to start the academic session in January from 2012, said an official in the school education department.        
	Sources said the Left Front education cell had on June 5 given the go-ahead to the governments proposal to switch back to the January-December session.        
	The government had in 2007 set up a panel to study the feasibility of reintroducing the January-December session after several experts had pointed out that the existing system was flawed.        
	The experts opined that the January-December system would yield more teaching-learning days than the April-March one.        
	They also pointed out that December was the ideal month in most of Bengal to conduct the annual exams.

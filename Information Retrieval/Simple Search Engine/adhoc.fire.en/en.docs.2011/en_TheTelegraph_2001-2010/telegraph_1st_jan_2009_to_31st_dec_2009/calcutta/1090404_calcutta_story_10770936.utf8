	A married tutor tried to kill a former student by slitting her throat before slashing his wrist with a razor because she had spurned his advances.        
	Arup Das, 35, followed the 22-year-old girl from Triveni, in Hooghly district, to a relatives home in Cossipore on Friday and attacked her in the presence of a cousin.        
	It was around 11.45am. There was a knock on our main door before he barged in, came straight to the bedroom where she was with me and attacked her with the razor. He then ran out and slashed his wrist. He collapsed in the park of our housing estate, the cousin told police.        
	The girl needed 10 stitches to close the gash in her throat. Her spurned suitor was admitted to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, from where he was shifted to SSKM Hospital. His condition is stable, the police said.        
	The girl had distanced herself from him after he proposed marriage. He couldnt take no for an answer and landed up at her aunts house. We have arrested him, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of the detective department.         
	The injured victim told Metro after returning to her maternal aunts home that Das had first proposed marriage in 2006 and continued to pester her even after she left his class.         
	I told him that I respected him as a teacher but could not even contemplate entering into a relationship with him because he was already married. I also told my parents about it and they were outraged. I stopped going to his classes after that.        
	The girl came to stay with her maternal aunts family so that she could write the Madhyamik examination in the city. This is her third attempt to clear Madhyamik.        
	According to the girls aunt, Das had called several times to threaten her niece. He threatened to kill her and commit suicide if she did not agree to marry him. But he wasnt ready to divorce his wife, she said.        
	The girls father, who works in a private company, arrived in the city with her mother late in the evening to be with their daughter.        
	A neighbour who ran to the second-floor flat after hearing the victim and her cousins screams for help said everything happened in a flash.         
	I am told that the assailant coolly entered the bedroom, grabbed the girl by the nape of her neck and went for her throat with the razor. The girls aunt, grandmother and cousin tried to stop him but couldnt.         
	While the girl was taken to North Suburban Cossipore Hospital, Das lay bleeding in the park till the police arrived.

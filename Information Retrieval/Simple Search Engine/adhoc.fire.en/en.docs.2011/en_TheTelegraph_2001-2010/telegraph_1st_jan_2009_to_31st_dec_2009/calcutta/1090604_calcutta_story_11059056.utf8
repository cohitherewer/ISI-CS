The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tourists few, plans many
                                                                                                               Tourists few, plans many
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	The number of foreign tourists visiting the state have dropped and the number of domestic tourists has increased marginally, prompting the West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation Limited to plan big this year.        
	According to state figures released on Wednesday, 1.93 crore domestic tourists and 11.33 lakh foreign tourists arrived in Bengal in the financial year 2008-09. According to government of India figures, in 2007-08, 1.85 crore domestic tourists and 11.54 lakh foreign tourists arrived in Bengal.        
	There was more bad news with the West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation recording an unaudited net profit of Rs 112 lakh (approx), for 2008-2009, a drop from the 2007-08 figure of Rs 192 lakh.        
	The drop was because we had to write off unwritten losses, explained tourism minister Manab Mukherjee.        
	To start afresh and aim big, the tourism corporation has plans to open a Tourism Plaza. It will be a one-stop tourism mall, said T.V.N. Rao, the managing director of the corporation.         
	It will have tour operators, representation from different countries and states, train booking, foreign exchange counters and more. The government has given the go-ahead and we are on the lookout for suitable land, he added on Wednesday.        
	The tourism board is also planning to focus on heritage this year with an investment of Rs 5 crore, half of which will be pumped into illumination of heritage structures.        
	Calcutta is rich in heritage and we have a mega plan in mind to promote heritage tourism. The first step is the illumination of six of the citys heritage structures (see graphic), said minister Mukherjee.        
	Adding colour to culture will be an entertainment zone at Subhash Sarobar, the 97.9-acre sprawl opposite Swabhumi, now in an advanced state of decay.        
	We have received Rs 4.9 crore from the government for development of tourism-related activities like water sports, an amphitheatre, rock garden and beautification of landscape and footpath. Work will begin this month and by January, we should have a few zones ready, said Rao.        
	After the success of Calcutta-based films like Yuva, Parineeta and The Namesake, the tourism department is also keen to project the state as a shooting destination.        
	At last years Cannes festival, we were the only ones to participate after the National Film Development Corporation urged states to promote shooting sites. It is an interesting area, said Mukherjee.        
	To increase accessibility to the state, the tourism corporation has also tied up with private travel sites like makemytrip.com and talks are on with the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation.        
	A West Bengal travel guide was launched on Wednesday, covering Calcutta, the Sunderbans, Murshidabad, Shantiniketan, Bishnupur, the Dooars and Darjeeling.

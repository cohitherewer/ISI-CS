The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Art college headless since July
                                                                                                               Art college headless since July
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The Government College of Art and Craft has for long been without a principal of repute, and now it has no principal at all. The appointment of the earlier recumbent, Kamalakshya Gangopadhyay, was cancelled by the West Bengal State Administrative Tribunal on July 7 on grounds of him not having the requisite qualifications. This is unprecedented in the 150-year history of the premier art school.         
	Dipali Bhattacharjee, who is one of the most senior teachers, has been appointed officer-in-charge of the college, but the selection of a new principal is still pending. The tribunal had ruled that a new principal should be selected within six months of the cancellation of Gangopadhyays appointment.         
	The latter has appealed to the high court against this verdict. The tribunal has also removed Bijan Chaudhury, known to be close to the ruling party, and Biman Bihari Das, former principal, and others from the selection board.         
	Even before Gangopadhyays appointment on November 11, 2006, his selection had been challenged by his colleague, Manoj Sarkar, a senior teacher of the college. His charge was that the advertisement for the post of principal specifically mentioned that the applicant must be distinguished in fine arts, whereas the appointee was only a second class graduate in commercial art.        
	There were others who were better qualified, Sarkar claimed. He was himself the most senior teacher then with 27 years of experience, yet he had been turned down.        
	Gangopadhyay, on the other hand, had joined as a teacher of graphic design/applied arts as recently as 2000. Gangopadhyay had continued as principal till July 23 when he received the order. He has returned to his former classroom.        
	All three teachers will retire in three years time, and both Sarkar and Dipali Bhattacharjee are of the 1974 batch.        
	The college has been left headless at a time when the National Accreditation Council had classed it a Grade I institution and recommended its autonomy as a potential centre of excellence. The institution is trying to turn its invaluable archive into a museum for which it expects to receive a central grant.

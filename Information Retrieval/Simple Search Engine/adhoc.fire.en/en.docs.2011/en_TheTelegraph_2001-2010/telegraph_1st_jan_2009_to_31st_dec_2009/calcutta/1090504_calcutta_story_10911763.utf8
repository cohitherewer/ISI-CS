The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Flights go off radar screen
                                                                                                               Flights go off radar screen

	Flights have been randomly disappearing from the secondary radar screen of the city airport prompting fears of mid-air mishaps, but the authorities have turned a blind eye.        
	Our radar system is working fine, said P.K. Singhal, the regional executive director (eastern region) of the Airports Authority of India, though other senior officials, on condition of anonymity, admitted to the vanishing act and blamed it on a snag in the airports secondary radar in Berhampore, Orissa.        
	We are trying to identify the snag and fix it, said an official.        
	Sources said at least five flights had gone missing from the screen over the past few days though the air traffic control (ATC) had confirmed that all were in the airspace covered by the secondary or Area South radar in Berhampore.        
	The radar, with its monitor at Calcutta airport, covers a radius of around 200 nautical miles and gives the altitude and speed of overflying aircraft. If the ATC is in the dark about an aircrafts position it can assign a similar altitude to another plane, leading to a disaster, an official warned.        
	On April 26, a Lufthansa flight from Bangkok to Frankfurt suddenly vanished from the screen around 12.30am. ATC officials were confused as all other aircraft flying through the radars range were visible.        
	A short while later, a Singapore Airlines flight from Singapore to Paris disappeared from the screen.        
	Around noon on Saturday, a Kingfisher flight from Mumbai to Bhubaneswar was flying through Calcuttas flight information range. The aircraft could not be traced on the screen even once though the ATC was communicating with the pilot through the voice transponder, said an official.        
	The flight was constantly on the radar screen of Nagpur ATC while it was in its range. This proves there is some defect in the secondary radar radar, said another official.        
	Late on Saturday, a Kenya Airways flight from Bangkok to Nairobi remained invisible on the screen throughout its journey through the Area South radar range.        
	A few days back, the ATC officials were unaware that a Singapore Airlines flight from Singapore to Milan had entered Calcuttas flight information range. We were surprised when the pilot first contacted us while flying over Bhubaneswar. The pilot was asked to switch off his transponder and then switch it on again. After a while, the blip appeared on the screen, much to our relief, said an ATC official.        
	A senior official at the airport said the secondary radar at Berhampore was installed in 2004 and commissioned two years later. Its functioning has never been satisfactory. There are dark zones in its coverage area, with obstacles like hills preventing proper transmission of signals, the official said.

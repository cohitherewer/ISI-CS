                      Impressions of life                    Actor, traveller and photographer, Karam Puri was born in India and grew up around the world. An accomplished lensman, he has been shooting professionally for over a decade now, with his works being published in various prestigious international journals. His first exhibition in Delhi, held in 2005, earned him great critical acclaim as he covered the protests leading up to the Republican National Convention in New York City. The ongoing exhibition of photographs includes 22 limited edition prints that are a part of the retrospective, A Million Voices. These images have been carefully curated and cover a body of work that spans the past 10 years. They traverse the globe and tell a thousand tales. Ideal for domestic or institutional space alike, each print is printed on Hahnemuhle Museum Etching Archival Paper. These handcrafted fine art Giclee prints use fade resistant ink as well as a non-nitrocellulose UV spray, which provide desired archival qualities in clarity and colour transmission.

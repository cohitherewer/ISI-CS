The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Shop stops as danger zones
                                                                                                               Shop stops as danger zones
                                              
	The concluding part of Metros survey of municipal markets in Salt Lake, most of which have turned into a shoppers nightmare              
	AB-AC Market         
	Established: 1975         
	Stalls: 85         
	Average daily footfall: 600        
	What we saw: The cement slabs covering the drain inside the market were either missing or broken.         
	The market has a history of chunks falling off and fires being caused by short-circuits but no effort was seen to prevent such accidents.         
	Rainwater dripped from naked electrical wires and meter boxes.         
	Market authorities said the civic body had not carried out repairs in the past five years forcing the market committee to collect money from traders and carry out patchwork.         
	Shoppers version: I had a close shave last year when a cement chunk fell right next to me. The market floor is so uneven and dirty that I hardly visit the stalls anymore, said Supratim Chakraborty, a resident of AB block.        
	CA Market         
	Established: 1972        
	Stalls: 107         
	Average daily footfall: 700        
	What we saw: From the outside, the market appeared in better condition than the others with a properly maintained green belt at the entrance. But inside there were cracked walls and broken cornices. Most shop owners complained of concrete chunks falling from the ceiling and injuring people. Large cracks were seen on the ceiling above the first-floor balcony.        
	Market committees version: During monsoon, almost all the shops have to use a plastic cover beneath the roof, which leaks profusely. We requested the municipal authorities repeatedly to carry out repairs but there was no response from them, said market secretary Shanti Roy.         
	Official word         
	Most of the markets need to be re-built but the municipality does not have enough funds to do it alone. So we have to invite private groups to build them properly in the shape of malls. But the shopkeepers are not agreeing to this in most cases, said a senior official of Bidhannagar Municipality, which is in charge of maintaining 16 markets in the township.               
	Tamaghna Banerjee

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Little men of history
                                                                                                               Little men of history
										      stage                        A scene from Ramu Ramanathans Jazz				                           
	From Shakespeares Falstaff to DL Roys Dildaar, we find colourful and often endearing characters on the fringes of history plays. Perhaps they are so endearing because they gave the writer a greater sense of freedom than when he dealt with historys main players.         
	Now it is the lesser men and women who take centrestage.         
	In Mumbai-based Ramu Ramanathans Mahadevbhai, which has just celebrated 150 shows at the Prithvi, we have Gandhi and the freedom movement seen through the eyes of Gandhis secretary Mahadev Desai.         
	Ramu uses docudrama to set records straight in Mahadevbhai. He uses Desais diary to counter the rampant anti-Gandhism and the systematic discrediting of democratic institutions.         
	In the city, there is Bratya Basus Ruddhasangeet, based on Debabrata Biswass autobiography Bratyajoner Ruddhasangeet (1979) and Ritwik Ghataks autobiography On the Cultural Front. Biswas and Ghatak, though icons, were struggling artists belonging outside the establishment. In Manoj Mitras Chhayar Prashad it is a poor homeless transvestite Dwaipayan who is ironically able to protect and care for those who come to him at a time when the Emperor Bindusara is unable to do either.         
	Bratya says his play is more fiction than docudrama. The artistic angst against repression even in post-Independence India has found an echo three decades later. Therefore the record box office success, smiles Bratya.        
	Instead of the limitations of space and time proffered by a historical event or the life of a particular person, Mitra prefers to catch the spirit of the times.         
	Chhayar Prashad, Debi Sharpamasta, Galpo Hekim Saheb are all historical plays where instead of the individual histories of Bindusara, Ashoka or Lord Canning, we have the socioeconomic reverberations of the oppressive Brahmanical cult, the Laws of Succession and Permanent Settlement seen in common people.         
	In Jazz, Ramus latest play, directed by Etienne Coutinho, we learn of forgotten Goan and Anglo Indian jazz musicians, whose genius and toil were often used without acknowledgement by Bollywood biggies C. Ramachander, Laxmikant Pyarelal, Shanker Jaikishen or O.P. Nayyar.       SEBANTI SARKAR

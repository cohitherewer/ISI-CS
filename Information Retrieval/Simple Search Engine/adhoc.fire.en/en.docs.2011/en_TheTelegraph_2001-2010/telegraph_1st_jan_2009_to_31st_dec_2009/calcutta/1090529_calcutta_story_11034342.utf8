The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fire on tower terrace
                                                                                                               Fire on tower terrace

	The worst fears of around 25 families in a six-floor building on Lenin Sarani came true around 6pm on Thursday when one of the three rooms on the terrace stacked with cables attached to three mobile phone towers caught fire.        
	Wool House was evacuated in a hurry even as seven fire engines managed to control the blaze, prevent injuries and minimise damage.        
	We realised there was a fire on the terrace and rushed out with the rest of the residents. We just hope the damage is not much, said H. Khan, sitting on a stool on the pavement with Tuffy, her Spitz, shivering at her feet.        
	The cause of the fire will only be ascertained after forensic tests, but angry residents blamed it on the cellphone towers allegedly installed on the terrace without their consent.        
	We had objected because we feared that it would be safety hazard, but the landlord paid no heed, said Jahanara Islam, whose family lives in apartments on the first and second floors.        
	According to firemen fighting the blaze, the building lacked the most basic fire preparedness. We will lodge an FIR against the building owner and will not restore the power connection until we are shown valid papers for the mobile phone towers, said Gopal Bhattacharya, the director of fire and emergency services.        
	 One of the owners of the building, Asadan Rehman, said there were towers of three service providers  Vodafone, Airtel and Tata Indicom  on the terrace. A room containing the Tata Indicom cables had caught fire.        
	According to telecom industry sources, towers located in power cut-prone areas are backed up with diesel generators, for which companies need to stock diesel, raising the risk of fire. Scattered cables can also spark a blaze.        
	We are yet to reach the spot where the fire broke out. We arent even sure if the tower is ours.... Generally we have fire alarms and fire extinguishers wherever we install any tower, a Tata Teleservices spokesperson said.        
	Fire minister Pratim Chatterjee, who visited the spot along with the CPM state secretary Biman Bose, said strict measures would be taken if the building did not have the civic bodys permission to install mobile towers.

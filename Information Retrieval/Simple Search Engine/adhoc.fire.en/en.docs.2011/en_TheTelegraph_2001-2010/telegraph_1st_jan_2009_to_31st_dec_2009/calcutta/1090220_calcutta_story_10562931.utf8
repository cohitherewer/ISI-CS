The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CM ban boost amp; green gaffes
                                                                                                               CM ban boost amp; green gaffes
          A STAFF REPORTER                           The chief minister presents a lifetime achievement award to R.K. Pachauri at the environment meet. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                  
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee lauded the high court for banning polluting autorickshaws and old diesel vehicles from the city before goofing up on his green facts at an environment summit on Thursday.        
	Auto emission is a serious problem. Calcutta High Court has correctly said that enough is enough, Bhattacharjee said at the programme organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce.        
	The chief minister admitted that autorickshaws were creating a problem and singled out commercial vehicles run on diesel as the primary source of pollution.        
	Bhattacharjee identified bio-diesel and electricity as the alternatives in the absence of CNG but seemed to have forgotten LPG, the clean fuel chosen for the city by his government and ratified by the high court.         
	The court had ordered the conversion of all four-stroke autorickshaws to LPG. The transport department is accordingly pursuing an autorickshaw replacement scheme based on the fuel.        
	Bhattacharjee made another faux pas on the dais he shared with climate scientist R.K. Pachauri and British deputy high commissioner Simon Wilson. He declared that the country and the state did not have the technology to manage solid waste and medical waste.        
	Every civic body in Calcutta and its suburbs, barring a few, have undertaken projects to manage solid waste with funds from the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission and other sources. Seven medical waste management facilities operate in the state. At least Rs 300 crore has been invested in these projects, said an official of the CMDA, which is the nodal agency for many such projects.        
	Barely three hours after the chief ministers speech, urban development minister and CMDA chairperson Asok Bhattacharya inaugurated a model scientific solid waste management facility in North Dum Dum.        
	Calcutta Foundation handed Pachauri a cheque for Rs 2 lakh at the summit. The money will be used to install solar lights in a village in the Sunderbans, said the scientist.

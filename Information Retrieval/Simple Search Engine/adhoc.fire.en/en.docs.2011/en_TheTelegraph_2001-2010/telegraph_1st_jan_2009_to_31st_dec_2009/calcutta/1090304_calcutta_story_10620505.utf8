          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two persons were killed and three injured in two accidents in the city on Tuesday afternoon.        
	Ranjit Kumar Sen, 60, was critically injured when the Opel Corsa he was travelling in collided with a private bus on route 241 on Garden Reach Road.        
	Sen was taken to CMRI where he was declared dead on arrival. He suffered head and chest injuries, an officer of Garden Reach police station said. The resident of Shakespeare Sarani, a civil engineer, was on his way to a Garden Reach office.        
	Sens driver, Sushil Kumar Kamath, and a 30-year-old passenger of the bus, identified as Tulsi Hazra, are being treated at the hospital for injuries.        
	Both the vehicles were being driven at a high speed. The bus driver has been arrested, said the officer.        
	A large number of people gathered on the spot immediately after the accident and tried to set the bus ablaze. A police team rushed there and brought the situation under control. Both vehicles, their windshields smashed, were towed to the police station.        
	In the other mishap, a 35-year-old man was run over by a private bus on route 43 at the Sovabazar crossing of Rabindra Sarani around 3.45pm.        
	He was taken to Medical College and Hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival. The police said the man, yet to be identified, had tripped while trying to board the bus and was crushed under its wheels. A 300-strong group blocked the road to protest lax policing on the busy stretch.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mirror, method, migration 
                                                                                                               Mirror, method, migration 
										      Eyewitness                                        From top: Works by Kristine Michael (picture by Rashbehari Das), Asim Waqif and Nantu Behari Das                          
	Indian culture would never have been the way it is had it been afraid of absorbing the culture of the peoples who came to this country from the dawn of civilisation as invaders, immigrants seeking refuge, traders, wanderers, fortune-seekers, missionaries and mercenaries.         
	Migration is the keystone of Indias syncretic culture. Recently an artists workshop titled Twisti-Twosti: Identities Migrating/Migrating Identities was held at Baruipur to evaluate and analyse the trends and tendencies of such an issue.         
	The art works created there were exhibited in the massive Emami Chisel Art Gallery off the EM Byspass till February 6. It was a large exhibition curated by Amit Mukhopadhyay with 18 participants from all over the country and some younger artists who worked as assistants.        
	As in the case of such large exhibitions the quality of the installations was quite uneven. Some of them were pointless as the artist concerned did not seem to have grasped the brief.         
	They were, perhaps, unable to think up images that would be visual equivalents of the issue of migration. There were, however, some artists whose installations did not need any explanation at all.         
	Kristine Michaels giant chilli and gourd with photographs of her multi-culti family represented as seeds of the vegetable told its own story.         
	So did Aditya Basaks home of wheels, Abhijit Guptas projections of railway tracks, B.K. Kamaths cupboard with fragments of various deities, Tushar Joags distillery and Archana Handes digital prints of marriage photographs and cheap adverts arranged to resemble school charts.         
	Surekhas interviews of Indo-Trinidadians was most enlightening. Mithu Sens serpent was rather obscure. Both Samindranath Majumdars pile-up holdalls and Sharmila Samaants Chinese dragon draped in a silk sari hardly had any elusive element to qualify as works of art.         
	Whatever the quality of individual works may have been, it was much more exciting than a regular gallery show.              
	Kazi Ghiyasuddin, whose works are being exhibited at Aakriti Art gallery, is from Bangladesh, but quite intriguingly, these are indistinguishable from the works of any artist this side of the Padma. His paintings are non-figurative and his palette comprises standard greys, blues, browns and white, geometric figures painted on some canvases.         
	Actually all these artists, be they from India or across the border, are still reeling under the influence of the Modernist painters. So there is nothing new to write about them.              
	The art and crafts movement of late 19th century was, in part, a romantic idealisation of the personal handiwork of craftsmen and artisans.         
	Bose Pacias current exhibition Analytical Engine curated by Heidi Fichtner focuses on intriguing and sophisticated art work created by harnessing both painstakingly traditional as well as cutting edge technology at a time when any technology becomes obsolete in 12 months.         
	Kiran Subbaiahs computer virus demonstrates how what we consider the frontiers of art and our concept of aesthetics are being challenged all the time in this age, when, as they say, one can be certain of impermanence alone.         
	Abhishek Hazras video work may be new media but it looks surprisingly low-tech. It reminds one of Walt Disney Studios abandoning computer technology in favour of hand-drawn cartoons. The human touch never becomes dated. Asim Waqifs bamboo-and-rope construct with the Saraswati image ensconced in its midst may have required a great degree of skill to put up, but it wont cut much ice in a city where experiments with divinities defy good taste and logic.         
	Navin Thomass use of momo-pots as amplifiers may be an innovative idea, but will viewers be willing to read the concept note to discover what he has up his sleeves?              
	Gandhara Art Gallerys exhibition at ICCR is built around the idea of Mirror Image, as its title suggests. Some of the artists have successfully been able to create visual correlatives of this concept in compact works.         
	Chhatrapati Dattas places a mammoth bone between double mirrors with reflected images of the same extending to infinity is a good example of that. The cross-sectional drawings of the bones underline this effect. Nantu Behari Dass cripple with an echo of its head on its bottom is a crude but effective translation of this idea into visual imagery. Sanjeet Chowdhurys black-and-white self-portrait behind a camera, sandwiched between two trophies and the image of a mystic is deliciously enigmatic.       SOUMITRA DAS

                      Playing it loud and clear                    Music lovers who missed Bertie Da Silvas last gig at G.D. Birla Sabhagar can look forward to more from the Prof Rocker at Red Romanov Presents Tango N Talkin with Bertie Da Silva in The Big New Gig. The electric new line-up who rocked the house remain the same, with Sooman on lead, Suraj Pradhan on drums, Willy Walters on the bass and Anindya Paul on backing vocals. The set list will remain mostly the same as that of the August concert at the Sabhagar and include new and old tunes in addition to a few Dylan covers. From songs like Shuffle that portrays young modern lives and how it moves from the Barista to the next career to the Big Apple and yet find life hard to tackle to the mellow Juliet who loved Norman Mailer, and the Emperor of Ice Cream. Watch out for lyrics that echo and melodies that stay. And Dylan, to make things fun, adds Bertie. Hell be playing at the venue more than a year after his gig with Pink Noise. Be there as he promises to play it loud.                    lEvent: Western pop and rock music performance by Tango N Talkin with Bertie Da Silva lWhen: Today at 9 pm lWhere: Someplace Else

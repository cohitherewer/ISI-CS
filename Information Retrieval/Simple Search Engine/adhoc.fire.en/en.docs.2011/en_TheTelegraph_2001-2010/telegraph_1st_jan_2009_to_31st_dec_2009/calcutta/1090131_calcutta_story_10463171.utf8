                                                                                                               Abducted girl rescued
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Zeenat with her mother. (Amit Datta)                                   
	An 11-year-old girl abducted from Park Street on Thursday night was rescued from Sealdah railway station early on Friday. One of the three alleged abductors has been arrested.        
	Police suspect the trio are involved in trafficking minor girls.        
	Zeenat Parveen, a resident of Ripon Street, was kidnapped while she was at a religious ceremony on Park Street with other local children.        
	A preliminary probe revealed that she was kidnapped by three men, who knocked her unconscious with chloroform, packed her into a taxi and took her to Sealdah station.        
	We arrested one of the trio, Zulfikar Ali, and slapped kidnapping charges on him. The Taltala resident is being interrogated to ascertain the motive and to trace the other two, said Jawed Shamim, the city detective chief.        
	It seems the men are involved in trafficking minor girls. We are checking Zulfikars antecedents, said an officer of Park Street police station.        
	The police said the girls hands were tied and she was lying face down on a platform when the police and some of her relatives arrived. Her abductors were sitting nearby, waiting for a train, said an officer.        
	A Class II student of Anjuman School, Zeenat was still in a state of shock when Metro visited her home later in the day. Three men forced me into a taxi. They threatened to kill me if I raised an alarm. I dont remember what happened after that, the girl recalled, clinging to her mother in their 9ftx9ft shanty. Zeenats father works in a parking lot.        
	An officer said Zeenat was at the religious ceremony around 9.30pm when Zulfikar approached her, saying her father had called her to a nearby milk shop.         
	When Zeenat reached the shop, Zulfikar and his accomplices kidnapped her.        
	Zeenat regained consciousness around 2.30am at Sealdah station and started shouting for help. Around the same time, the police and some of her family members arrived. Seeing the cops, the trio started running.         
	The police caught Zulfikar but the other two escaped.

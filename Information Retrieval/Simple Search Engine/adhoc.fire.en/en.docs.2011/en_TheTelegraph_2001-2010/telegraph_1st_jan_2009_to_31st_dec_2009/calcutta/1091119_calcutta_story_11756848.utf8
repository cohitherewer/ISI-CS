The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Wintry feel this weekend
                                                                            Thursday , November 19 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Wintry feel this weekend
  - Clear sky amp; Celsius slide from Thursday, but not winter yet          MEGHDEEP BHATTACHARYYA                                    
	Calcuttans got a taste of nippy November on Wednesday with the maximum temperature plunging to five degrees below normal at 24.4 degrees Celsius and the weatherman eyeing wintry conditions from Saturday.        
	We have good news. The skies will clear after midday on Thursday, which will result in a gradual drop in temperature, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.        
	The lack of cloud cover would allow the Northwesterlies to blow in over south Bengal. So, Calcutta should enjoy cold, wintry conditions from Saturday, added Debnath.        
	But the wintry feel must not be confused with winter come early, warns the weatherman. The official onset of winter still remains more than a week away.        
	According to the chief meteorologist of a private met agency, for winter to be declared in Calcutta the maximum temperature should be around 25 degrees Celsius or less and the minimum, nine to 15 degrees Celsius. The maximum relative humidity should be around 75 per cent and the discomfort index 55 degrees Celsius or less.        
	The minimum temperature on Wednesday was 20.6 degrees Celsius, three degrees above normal. The maximum relative humidity was 95 per cent. The discomfort index read 57 degrees Celsius, just two notches above normal.        
	Last year, Calcuttas date with winter was delayed by a fortnight as it only set in on December 18. That should not happen this time, with the city set to keep its end-November tryst with winter.        
	A pattern that has emerged since 2006 indicates that winter gets delayed in Calcutta because of low-pressure formations and cyclonic disturbances. That looks unlikely this year, said an official from the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting in Noida.        
	Windy Wednesday was grey and drizzly, as the Alipore Met office recorded 3.7mm of rain (in 24 hours till 5.30pm).        
	It was cold even at 9am when I left for work. I brought out a windcheater for the first time this year. I hope winter sets in early, said Dipankar Ghosh, 58, an RBI official.        
	With the skies set to clear up on Thursday following the weakening of the low pressure trough, the heat will escape and the path will be cleared for Northwesterlies to flow.        
	But the wintry feel has little to do with the onset of winter, which is at least 10 days away, said an official of the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hut hurdle on runway extension path 
                                                                                                               Hut hurdle on runway extension path

	The extension of the city airports secondary runway, a key part of the Rs 2,100-crore modernisation project, is set to take off this week, but encroachments could still prove a hindrance.        
	The construction of a road replacing another that cuts across the proposed extension path  which was holding up the project for the past few months  has been completed.         
	The state government informed us that the traffic diversion will start in a couple of days. We are planning to start extending the runway this week, said a senior official of the Airports Authority of India (AAI).         
	The secondary runway will be extended by 400 metres, of which 65 metres will lie beyond the existing boundary wall. The AAI plan to push back the new boundary wall another 240 metres to accommodate the runway safety area.        
	About 500 families living in huts along the edge of the area to be added are proving an impediment.         
	An airport official said the encroachments could stop them from erecting the boundary wall and making the extended runway operational.         
	Rajarhat-Gopalpur municipality had promised to rehabilitate the encroachers.         
	State home secretary Ardhendu Sen last week said the government would take steps to clear the encroachments. If there is any problem because of the encroachments, we will definitely take steps, he said.        
	A road to the south of the airport, linking Kaikhali and Narayanpur by cutting across the proposed expansion plot, was the first hurdle.        
	The government had agreed to replace it with a 1.5km semi-circular road skirting the earmarked plot. The state was supposed to hand over 6.6 acres earmarked for the project after laying the new road by March.         
	The state government officials informed the AAI last week that the diverted stretch of the road was ready for use.        
	It is a low land and we will start landfilling immediately, said an AAI official. The work would take at least three months to be completed.        
	The secondary runway is being extended to allow bigger aircraft, such as A380, to operate from it.        
	Instrument landing system, approach lights and other equipment will also be installed to upgrade the runway.        
	The runway was earlier extended by 400 metres at the other (northern) end.

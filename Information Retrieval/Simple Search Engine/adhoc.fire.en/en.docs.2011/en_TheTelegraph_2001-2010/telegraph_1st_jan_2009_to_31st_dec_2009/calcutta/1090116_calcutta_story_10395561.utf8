                                                                                                               College plot row
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The Lakhotia group of companies moved the high court on Thursday challenging the state governments acquisition of a 13-cottah plot in Burrabazar for the expansion of Bethune College.        
	One of the lawyers representing the group claimed the Lakhotias owned the plot and had planned to set up a mall on it.        
	Local MP Sudhangshu Seal had illegally interfered to acquire the land on behalf of the government, he said.        
	The lawyers also alleged the government broke rules during the take-over.        
	A government lawyer said the land had been acquired for the benefit of education. State advocate-general Balai Ray will represent the government in the case.        
	Justice J. Bhattacharya, after a brief hearing, adjourned the matter till January 21.         
	Seal has also appointed a lawyer in this regard. The MP has been falsely implicated in the case. The government acquired the land but the petitioner lodged several allegations against the MP, said an aide of Seal.        
	Bethune College authorities refused to comment on the controversy.        
	We had approached the government and were told that we would get land, said an official of the college.

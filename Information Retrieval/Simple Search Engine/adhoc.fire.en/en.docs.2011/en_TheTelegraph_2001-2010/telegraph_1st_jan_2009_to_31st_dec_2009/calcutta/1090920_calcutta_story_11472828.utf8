The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cool comfort for pandal-hopping
                                                                                                               Cool comfort for pandal-hopping
                                          
	This Puja, the pandal-hopper can hop into a cool cab when the crowd gets the better of him. He will have several options with the Delhi-based Mega Cabs giving Calcutta its second dial-a-cab service a year after Kolkata Cabs debuted in August 2008.         
	Mega Cabs has rolled out 100 air-conditioned Indigo Marinas (picture left ), fitted with GPS, plush seats and ticket printers and chauffeured by trained, uniformed drivers. The fare is Rs 15 per km, fixed by the government. There is a night charge and waiting cost. Though the fare is a tad higher than yellow taxis, Mega Cabs is bullish on Calcutta.         
	If a customer is paying Rs 12 a km on a 10-year-old non-AC yellow taxi, we are sure he wouldnt mind shelling out a few extra bucks for a new air-conditioned cab, said Binod Mishra, the general manager (operations) of Mega Corporation Ltd. The company hopes to add another 100 cars to its fleet post-Diwali. Mega Cabs launched in Delhi in 2001 and in Mumbai in 2006 and plies in north Indian cities and towns like Amritsar, Ludhiana, Mohali and Chandigarh. So, why did they foray into Calcutta almost a decade after entering Delhi? The radio taxi policy for West Bengal was formulated by the transport department only in 2008, said Mishra. We are receiving close to 1,000 calls a day in the city, he added.        
	Kolkata Cabs is doing well too. The radio taxi service was launched last year with 100 cabs and the demand is so high that we are adding another 100 cars, said Neeraj Kumar, the CEO of Orix Auto Infrastructure Services Ltd., the parent company of Kolkata Cabs.         
	A market expert said the radio taxi phenomenon has really caught on in Calcutta and there was enough scope for other dial-a-cab services to set up shop here. Kumar said Kolkata Cabs gets 500 to 600 calls per day, and services 200 to 300 customers.         
	As in other cities, airport drops and pick-ups are the most popular services. The operators have requested the government to allocate them designated parking at the airport and railway stations.

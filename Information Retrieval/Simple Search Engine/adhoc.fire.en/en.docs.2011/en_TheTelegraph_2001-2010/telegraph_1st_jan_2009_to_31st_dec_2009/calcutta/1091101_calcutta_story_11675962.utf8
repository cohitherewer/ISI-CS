The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cement to gloss over past

										      flashback                        Canal Villa under renovation. Picture by Anindya Shankar Ray				                           
	At the head of Chitpur Road, at the point where Galiff Street intersects Kshirode Prasad Vidya Vinod Avenue is a biggish pile, turned dun-coloured with age and obscured by trees and the high wall running around it. On its left side is Kshirode Prasad Vidya Vinod Avenue, a large part of which was originally an extension of the Canal Villa boundary. Now it is the stand of buses on route No: 242.         
	The double-storeyed building is pierced with large windows on all sides but most of the shutters remain closed nearly all day. The backyard is a garden of weeds with clumps of trees  mango and champak.         
	This is Canal Villa that was originally built in October 1838 with the double purpose of serving as the quarters-cum-office of the supervisor of the Calcutta Canal Sub-division. Now, after about two decades of neglect, Canal Villa is finally being renovated.        
	Canal Villa must have looked quite imposing before the unsightly blocks of flats had come up behind it. Adjacent to it is Womens College of 1937 vintage. Even now it is bound to attract attention by its sheer volume and height.         
	Opposite the house are the two Chitpur bridges, both new and old. This is the area where the Chitpur nawabs once used to reside. They had built the Boshri Shah mosque further down, said to be Calcuttas oldest mosque. But that is not visible from here. Across the road are Chitpur tram depot and the Bagbazar lockgate not in use any longer.        
	Sukumar Naskar, 55, the superintending engineer (Eastern Circle) of the irrigation department, who had lived in Canal Villa since 1991 till recently, says going by the crumbling records existing with his office, it was constructed at a cost of Rs 27,228, its plot cost Rs 4,227 and its water supply system Rs 803.         
	Galiff, after whom the neighbouring street and tram depot are named, was one of its first residents. Naskar says that as with all surki and lime buildings with thick walls, Canal Villa used to be cool in summer and warm in winter.        
	Historian Radharaman Mitra had written in Kolikata Darpan, first published in 1980: In the eighth or ninth decade of the last century, an Englishman named J.C. Vertannes was superintending engineer of the south-east circle of the canals system. And the man after whom Galiff Street is named, the self-same Galiff, was superintendent of the circular and eastern canals division and collector. His office was at No. 9 Galiff Street and the name of the house was Canal Villa. That house still exists.... After Independence, the circular and eastern canals division came under the irrigation department.         
	Tax collection was the main job of the British officer and he used to keep watch on horseback. So there used to be a stable on the villa premises which is being turned into a garage now. There used to be a cookhouse, and privy besides.         
	In 1909-10, accommodation for the durwan was provided for. The ground floor was used as his office while the first floor was his residence. The waterways were the most important means of transportation and it was his business to collect toll from distant places like Midnapore, Namkhana and Burdwan. There was no scheduled time for the toll to arrive, so the officer always had to be on the ready. Naskar says there used to be a small chest in a ground floor room but it could not be prised open. He adds he had once found a paper which said toll collection in 1938 was Rs 148,000, but he could not vouch for its authenticity.        
	Canal Villa is an austere building with hardly any ornamentation save the arches over the widows supported by pilasters on the first floor. The plinth too had arches like many buildings of that period but those were filled up long ago. The windows have glass panels, fixed louvres and louvres of wood. Each floor has two large rooms and a wooden staircase leads to the upper storey. On the outer face of the house in front of the unkempt garden is a cast iron winding staircase connected to the terrace. The area it covers is 2,243sq ft x 64,486cu ft. The house is about two feet below street level, but the drainage system is so good that even after a heavy shower there is no waterlogging.        
	As toll collection began to decline, the Calcutta Canal Sub-Division was shifted and it became the residence of the sub-divisional officer of Calcutta Canal Sub-Division. Subsequently, it used to be shared by the SDO Calcutta Canals and one of the executive engineers of the irrigation department.        
	Canal Villa was in a woeful condition for quite some time. Cracks had appeared on its walls and gaps had formed in the tiled roof. Now it is being thoroughly renovated but one may question the use of cement in what is essentially a lime and surki structure. Even the plaster is cement, but it has been so for ages now. Naskar says in spite of its age, Canal Villa has not been declared a heritage building. They have written several times to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation but to no avail. So who cares if either surki and lime or simply cement are being used to restore it?

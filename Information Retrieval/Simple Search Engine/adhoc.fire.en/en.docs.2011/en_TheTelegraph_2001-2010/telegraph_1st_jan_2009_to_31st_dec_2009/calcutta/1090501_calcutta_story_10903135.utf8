The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Schools to tighten safety net   Campus care
                                                                                                               Schools to tighten safety net     - Akriti aftershock: medical care amp; SOS measures on campus          MITA MUKHERJEE                                                  
	The Akriti Bhatia aftershock has touched school campuses in Calcutta. The death of the 17-year-old student of Modern School in Delhi on April 20 is forcing institutions in the city to review medical matters.        
	From training teachers to handle a medical emergency to tying up with hospitals, schools are set to take steps to become safer places for children to be in (see chart).        
	The tragic incident in Delhi is a wake-up call. It is difficult to provide medical facilities in each and every school at one go, but we are going to start the process after the Lok Sabha polls to ensure that there is some arrangement in every school, said a senior official of the state school education department.        
	Akriti died on her way to hospital after an asthma attack in school. Her family has alleged that the authorities wasted 45 precious minutes before taking her to hospital. Today, there are no guidelines for medical health facilities in schools in Calcutta.        
	It is not possible for each of the 12,000-odd Madhyamik schools to have a full-time doctor. We are looking at tying up with local clinics, a pool of doctors and nurses and hospitals in every locality. The facilities will be shared by a cluster of schools, a system followed for board exams, said Partha Roy, the secretary of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education.        
	Some private schools said they are attached to hospitals for an emergency, but felt more needs to be done. It is clear now that just tying up with a hospital is not enough, said Terence Ireland, the principal of St James School.                    
	We will organise a series of training programmes for our teachers after the summer vacation on how to react if a child falls critically ill in school, added Ireland.        
	Guardians must also play their part in equipping schools to handle an emergency better, stressed Father Moloy DCosta, the education inspector of Roman Catholic schools under the Calcutta Archdiocese.        
	We will conduct interactive sessions with guardians so that they can keep the school posted about a childs medical condition and a tragedy like the one in Delhi can be averted, said DCosta.        
	There are around 25 missionary schools under the Calcutta Archdiocese, including St Xaviers, Don Bosco, the Loreto group and Carmel.        
	Time is of the essence in an emergency, stress schools like Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School. So teachers have been instructed not to waste any time if a child is taken ill in school.        
	The teachers need not even consult me in an emergency. They can act according to the situation and ensure the childs safety, said principal Malini Bhagat.

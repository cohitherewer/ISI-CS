The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Husband throws acid at crooner
                                                                                                               Husband throws acid at crooner
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The husband of a crooner allegedly threw acid on her while she was returning home after performing in a Waterloo Street bar early on Monday.        
	Princy Dey, in her mid-30s, was under observation at a private hospital.        
	She told police that her husband Mohammad Sikander, along with three friends, was waiting for her on deserted Waterloo Street, outside the bar, with two bottles of acid and attacked her when she came out around 1am.         
	I was looking for a taxi after coming out of the bar when I saw Sikander. He walked towards me and suddenly threw acid on my face and body. He then sped away with his friend on two motorcycles. I soon lost consciousness because of the pain, the police quoted Princy as saying.        
	According to investigators, Sikander did not want his wife to sing in bars and suspected her of having affairs with regulars at the Waterloo Street restaurant where she had been performing for the past few months. He has not returned to the couples rented flat in Baguiati since the attack. The three who accompanied him are also on the run.        
	The police have charged Sikander and his associates with attempt to murder. We suspect that Sikander has fled to Haryana, from where he came to the city 10 years ago. We have contacted our counterparts in Punjab and will nab Sikander soon, said joint commissioner (headquarters) Jawed Shamim.        
	Body found: The body of an unidentified man, aged around 21, was found at Anandapur off the EM Bypass in Tiljala on Monday. Police said there were injuries on the youths head. The cops suspect he was murdered elsewhere. The body has been sent for post-mortem.

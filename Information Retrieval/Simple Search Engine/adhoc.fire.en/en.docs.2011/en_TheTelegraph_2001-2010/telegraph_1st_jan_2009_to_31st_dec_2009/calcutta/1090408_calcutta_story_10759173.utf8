The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | City saviour for Aussie club 
                                                                                                               City saviour for Aussie club

	A city businessman has bailed a provincial basketball team in Australia out of a financial crisis.        
	Arun Kumar Jagatramka, the 47-year-old managing director of Calcutta-based Gujarat NRE Coke, recently pledged 1 million Australian dollars to Wollongong Hawks.         
	The club, which won the national basketball league (NBL) in Australia in 2001, was on the verge of being ousted from this years league as it failed to pledge the mandatory bank guarantee.        
	Repeated pleas to the provincial government and an online campaign at savethehawks.com were of no use.        
	Barely three hours before the deadline, team captain Mat Campbell sent an SOS to the Calcutta-based businessman, who was then in Australia on work. Jagatramka agreed to pledge the required 1 million Australian dollars.         
	I had noticed the campaign to collect money for the team during my previous visits to Wollongong but did not pay attention as I was sure that some local business house would come to its rescue, said the mining magnate, who owns two coking coal mines and a house in Wollongong.        
	He is a frequent visitor to the seaside city in Illawarra, New South Wales, the ninth largest in Australia. Wollongong has several mines, a steel plant and an industrial port.        
	Interest in coal mines took Arun, a graduate from St Xaviers and a resident of Hastings in Calcutta, to the city Down Under at the beginning of this decade.        
	During my last visit to Wollongong in end-March one of my associates informed me that the Hawks were still looking for money. I thought it would be very sad if a four-decade-old team, and a champion at that, would perish for the lack of a bank guarantee, said Jagatramka.         
	I went to Australia to buy coal but ended up helping a local basketball team, he added.        
	Rescuing struggling organisations comes naturally to the businessman.        
	In the mid-1990s, with his relatives struggling to run the family business, he left a lucrative merchant banking career and took over the reins of the Gujarat NRE Coke.        
	The company has since become the biggest manufacturer of metallurgical coke in the country.        
	Ties of the heart and not his head for business motivated Jagatramkas latest investment.        
	I am emotionally attached to Wollongong and its residents. When I saw such an old club on the verge of extinction, I did not think twice before taking the plunge, he said.         
	What does he expect from the team he holds a stake in? The biggest reward would be when the boys take the court this season. I am not thinking about anything else, said Jagatramka.        
	L.N. Mittal and Vijay Mallaya are two other Indian businessmen with stakes in soccer and F1 teams abroad.

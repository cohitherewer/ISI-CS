The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CID draws up Yash murder suspect list
                                                                                                               CID draws up Yash murder suspect list
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Yash Lakhotia                                  
	The Criminal Investigation Department on Sunday prepared a list of people who were interrogated by Howrah police in connection with the abduction and murder of seven-year-old Yash Lakhotia in January.        
	A team of officers also visited the site in Shibpur where the child, a resident of the neighbourhood, was found dead with strangulation marks on the throat, blood oozing from the mouth and nose.        
	The CID has recently taken over the probe from Howrah police.        
	The Shibpur resident was abducted on January 29 and found dead beside Foreshore Road two days later but the district police have failed to arrest a single suspect.        
	The cops had suspected that the abduction and murder were masterminded by Santosh Singh, an acquaintance of the Lakhotias. Later, the name of a realtor cropped up as the prime accused.        
	The probe is still in the preliminary stage. We are trying to find out the people who saw Yash during the final hours of his life, said a CID officer.        
	Our main job is to unearth the motive behind the murder, said a CID officer.        
	Yashs family members expressed happiness after they learnt that the CID had taken over the case. We hope the CID will be able to crack the case soon and arrest the culprits. The killers should get exemplary punishment, said Yashs uncle Nandu.        
	The family had met the director-general of police, A.B. Vohra, on March 20 and requested him to ask the CID to take over the probe from the district police.

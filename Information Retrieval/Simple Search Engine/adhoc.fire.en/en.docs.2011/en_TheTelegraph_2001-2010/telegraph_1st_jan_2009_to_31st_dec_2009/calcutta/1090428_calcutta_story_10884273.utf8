The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Court raps cops for Maidan maul 
                                                                                                               Court raps cops for Maidan maul 
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          Food being cooked on the Maidan during the December 20 rally. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta High Court on Monday came down strongly on the city police for the mauling of the Maidan during a rally by the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) on December 20 last year. The court also made scathing remarks against the DYFI for violating its order regarding the greens.        
	What is the police for? Why did it not take action against the persons who had allegedly violated court orders and cooked food on the Maidan on the day of the rally? a division bench headed by Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya asked.         
	The court was hearing submissions on the report filed by the army  the custodian of the Maidan  on the DYFI rally. The bench said the police stood helpless and as mum spectators before the rallyists. If you people are really helpless, you should inform the court straightway, it said.        
	On the DYFI, the bench said: The organisation in its affidavit said that some traders had sold cooked food on the Maidan on the rally date. Then why didnt the organisation take any action against those traders? Why didnt it lodge complaints against those people with the police?        
	The court also wanted to know why the DYFI gave an undertaking to the police that the court order would not be violated, if it was powerless to restrain people from creating pollution on the Maidan.        
	The bench also pointed out that it was the duty of the court to see whether its earlier orders were being carried out. Violators of court orders will have to face the consequences.        
	After the courts observations, Subhash Dutta, the petitioner in a Maidan pollution case, submitted that political parties had repeatedly violated the court directives while holding rallies on the lungs of the city. He said the Maidan area was equally vitiated during a rally by the Left Front on February 8 this year. Food was cooked and vehicles were parked on the Maidan during the Left Front rally, the green activist said.        
	The bench asked the city police to file a report on the Left Front rally at the next hearing of the case.         
	The lawyer representing the army supported Duttas claim and said Fort William was against holding of rallies on the Maidan. He said the local army authorities had found that the DYFI had failed to carry out the courts directive and clean up the Maidan even 72 hours after the December 20 rally.        
	The DYFIs lawyer said the court should not rely on newspaper reports and conclude that its order was violated by the organisation. The court heard the submissions of all the parties to the case and adjourned its judgment.

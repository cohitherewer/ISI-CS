	1) Ahanjit Bhattacharya         
	School: Ramakrishna Mission Vidyalaya, Narendrapur        
	Success formula: I was very thorough with my HS syllabus and that was my formula for success in JEE. I was expecting to rank among the first 50 but never expected I would come first! I studied around 10 hours a day after the selection tests but also took out time to relax.              
	2) Sayan Bhoumik        
	School: Ramakrishna Mission Vidyalaya, Deoghar         
	Success formula: I put in about 10 hours of study regularly. Last year I did not get a rank in JEE so I was very tense this time. I always wanted to be a doctor and now I can fulfil my dream by studying in Calcutta Medical College.              
	3) Sagnik Sen         
	School: South Point High School        
	Success formula: Hear it from Sagniks mother. He was never a bookworm, but studied regularly. He loves watching TV and is an avid fan of Discovery Channel. He was always interested in the medical line. He has not decided which stream he will specialise in but is more interested in research.              
	4) Shuvadeep Ganguly         
	School: Jodhpur Park Boys High School         
	Success formula: I wanted to become a doctor since childhood. Biology is my favourite subject and I love watching TV programmes on surgery and attending seminars on biology. I want to study neuroscience and go in for research. I studied my texts thoroughly and took mock exams to test my preparedness.              
	5) Anish Chowdhury         
	School: St Stephens School, Dum Dum         
	Success formula: I studied my textbooks and reference books thoroughly and also took mock tests. I felt if my basics were weak then no amount of tests would help. Extra coaching also helped me a lot. I want to become a cardiac surgeon.              
	engineering        
	1) Swarnabha Chattaraj         
	School: Bankura Zilla School         
	Success formula: My entire focus in the last two years was on JEE, so I didnt aim at getting a very high score in HS. Enrolling with a coaching centre helped me a lot but in the end what matters is ones own preparation.              
	2) Abhijeet Das         
	School: Salt Lake School         
	Success formula: I focused on IITJEE but my preparations helped me crack WBJEE as well. I expected to be in the top 10 but coming second was like the icing on the cake. I studied for at least 10 hours a day. I did not neglect my board exams because competitive exams are unpredictable and one must keep a fall-back option.              
	3) Shouvik Ganguly        
	School: South Point High School        
	Success formula: I relied heavily on the coaching centre and took mock tests regularly. I studied the course materials for JEE thoroughly. I expected to rank among the first 25 but coming third was unexpected. I used to listen to Kishore Kumar songs to refresh my mind and it helped me concentrate better.              
	4) Subhadip Chowdhury        
	School: KTPP High School, Kolaghat        
	Success formula: I put in at least eight hours of study every day but a fixed routine does not work for me. I never studied more for than one-and-a-half hours at a stretch and that helped me become more focused. I also watched cartoon shows on TV every single day.              
	5) Abhishek Roy         
	School: Jadavpur Vidyapith         
	Success formula: I preferred to study on my own and not with batches of 40 or 50 students as is the norm in most coaching centres. One-on-one coaching worked very well but I also studied various books. I put in 10 to 11 hours of study every day. Since I focused on WBJEE and IITJEE, my HS score suffered a bit. I hope to take up electronics engineering. After my BTech, I want to do an MTech and then go in for research. I would like to become a professor.

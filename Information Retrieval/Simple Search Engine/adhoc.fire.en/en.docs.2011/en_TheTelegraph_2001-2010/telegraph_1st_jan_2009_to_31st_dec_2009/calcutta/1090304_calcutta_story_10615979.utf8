                                                                                                               Audi zooms into town
          SUBHRO SAHA                          An Audi                                  
	Audi has followed Mercedes, BMW and Volkswagen into town, completing the German quartet of luxury cars.        
	A city-based initiative of young entrepreneurs has made the Audi range and total service back-up available in Calcutta before a dealership of the company opens shop.        
	We have entered into a tie-up with Shreyansh Automobiles in Mumbai, an Audi dealer, to sell and service the entire range, says Harsh Agarwal of Marks N Glix, which has launched a one-stop retail outlet for all car-related needs and is planning to open another this weekend.        
	Marks N Glix, which had worked out a similar pre-dealership arrangement with a Volkswagen dealer to drive in the Passat and Jetta for city customers, plans to rev it up further with another German biggie, Porsche, and Nissan of Japan, for top-of-the-line sports cars.        
	We are the only company offering a test drive and complete after-sales service for Audi cars in Calcutta through our tie-up with the designated dealer, and the vehicles are made available here at no extra cost. We have already sold around 10 Audis in Calcutta, adds Vinay Daga of Marks N Glix.        
	Audi is headquartered in Ingolstadt, Bavaria, and has been an almost wholly owned (99.7 per cent) subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group (Volkswagen AG) since 1964.        
	Marks N Glix, a strategic alliance between Mark Wheels dealing in car finance and distributorship and Glix 2000, a car detailing and accessories outfit, has opened its flagship outlet in Ballygunge and is unveiling a second showroom in Salt Lake.        
	Both these stores will be equipped to handle buying, selling, resale, after-sales service, modifications and performance enhancement, accessories, finance and insurance  a first under one roof, says Uday Mahawar, a partner in the company.        
	One more outlet is coming up on Rawdon Street and Marks N Glix is planning to introduce similar after-sales back-up service for Porsche, Nissan and other makes it is planning to bring in before the official dealership.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | IT minister makes a Mahindra move
                                                                                                               IT minister makes a Mahindra move
          DEVADEEP PUROHIT AND CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE                                            
	The state information technology (IT) department, having burnt its fingers in the flare-up at Vedic Village, is desperate to shake hands with players big and credible.        
	So, on Thursday, Debesh Das shook hands with Anand Mahindra.        
	The closed-door meeting between the IT minister and the chairman of Mahindra amp; Mahindra took place at the companys headquarters in Mumbai.        
	It was facilitated by former PricewaterhouseCoopers man Roopen Roy, who is now the managing director of Deloitte and Touche.        
	The meeting is being seen by the IT department as a decisive step to bury the ghost of Bengal Diamond Vedic IT Links, sullied and scrapped in the wake of the violence at Vedic Village, and move on.        
	The IT minister, on Friday evening, refused to either confirm or deny the meeting with Mahindra. I cannot say anything on this matter, stonewalled Das.        
	Sources in the IT department, however, said the meeting was arranged amidst the growing buzz of Satyam (now Mahindra Satyam) giving up its 2.77 acres in Sector V and of Tech Mahindra, the IT arm of Mahindra amp; Mahindra, exiting from the Bantala SEZ where it has 12 acres.        
	The minister went with the aim of convincing Mahindra Satyam to stay on and Tech Mahindra to expand operations, said an IT department official.        
	That was the starting point, said sources, with the minister then urging Mahindra to partner the Bengal government in a big way.        
	There was little talk of what that big way might be, but as a first meeting it went off well, sources added.        
	Going with the likes of Raj K. Modi and Amarnath Shroff  Webels partners in the proposed 1,200 acre IT township next to Vedic Village  has resulted in us burning bridges with Infosys and Wipro. We need a big name to bail us out of this crisis and revive Bengals IT dream, said an official, on condition of anonymity.        
	Enter, Mahindra amp; Mahindra. The companys Mumbai headquarters did not comment on Thursdays meeting, but Tech Mahindra officials in Delhi denied any plans of scaling down operations or exiting Bengal.        
	We have already expanded from 1,500 employee strength to 2,500 employee strength recently. We have taken another 1,300-odds seats in the DLF IT Park in Rajarhat. We are definitely looking at expansion in Bengal, stressed a Tech Mahindra spokesperson.        
	Before the lid was blown off the Rs 7,000 crore fraud, Satyam boss B. Ramalinga Raju had requested the Bengal government for 25 to 50 acres to set up an IT campus in the city.        
	The IT department had planned to offer Satyam a plot in either the 350-acre township at Jagadishpur or in the 1,200 acre park adjoining Vedic Village. The first failed to take off after hitting land acquisition hurdles while the other had to be scrapped following the arson on August 23 that blew the lid off the murky land deals in Rajarhat.        
	So, did the minister offer Anand Mahindra the 25 to 50 acres earlier pencilled for Satyam? With both the proposed IT parks scrapped, how can the government offer any IT company a large plot, said an official, adding that it would be great if Mahindra played a role in the 100-acre IT township in Kalyani which has failed to take off.        
	Even if Mahindra does not play a bigger role in Bengal the fact that the IT minister has taken the initiative to meet them and set things rolling is a positive sign, said Kalyan Kar, the managing director of Acclaris in Sector V.

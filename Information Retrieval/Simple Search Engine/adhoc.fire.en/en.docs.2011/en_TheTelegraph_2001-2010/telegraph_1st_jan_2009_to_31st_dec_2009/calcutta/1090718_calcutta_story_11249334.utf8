The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Surgery heals spine, bandh breaks spirit
                                                                                                               Surgery heals spine, bandh breaks spirit
  - Howrah agony on arrival from Bangalore           KINSUK BASU                           Durgadas Chakrabarty at Howrah station. Picture by Pradip Sanyal                                                                      
	As Anuradha and her son waited in the terminal, Laxmi Narayan stepped out to look for an ambulance or a taxi. I was willing to pay double the fare to travel to my in-laws house at Hind Motor, if not our home in Durgapur. Taxis were parked outside but no driver was willing to go. One driver said he didnt want to take a chance after being beaten up in Singur while returning from a trip on a bandh day.        
	On realising that finding transport during the bandh hours was impossible, Laxmi Narayan enquired whether there was a retiring room on the ground floor where his son could rest properly.        
	So did he find one?         
	 I was told Howrah station has no such room on the ground floor. How could I have taken Durga upstairs in this condition? the railway employee said, his voice drowning in the repeated announcements about cancelled trains.         
	Laxmi Narayan said Fridays bandh made him realise how much Calcutta lacked in every sphere. The Bangalore station has ramps for people on wheelchairs. Howrah has none. I couldnt even find a stretcher. If a bandh means shutdown of even emergency services, I am afraid we are regressing while the rest of the world is progressing.         
	As his father spoke, Durgadass eyes scanned the high ceiling before resting on a sapling wrapped in a newspaper. I got this beautiful plant from Bangalore. It is for my nursery in Durgapur, said the youth, who had injured his spine in an accident in 2004.

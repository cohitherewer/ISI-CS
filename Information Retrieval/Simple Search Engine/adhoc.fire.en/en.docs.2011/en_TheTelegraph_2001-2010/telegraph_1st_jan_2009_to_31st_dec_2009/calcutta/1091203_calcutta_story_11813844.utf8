The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CAT and mouse stumps students
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      CAT and mouse stumps students
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The computerised Common Admission Test (CAT) had a glitch-free fifth day but a buzz about the online exam being cancelled midway left those who have taken it and the thousands who are slated to do so in a tizzy.         
	I took the test on Monday and it went off well despite me being tense about the possibility of technical errors. Now I hear that the entire online test might be scrapped, and thats not fair, said a 20-year-old student of commerce.        
	Several students, however, welcomed the idea of holding a pen-and-paper test afresh, saying that their performance was affected by the glitches.        
	A precedent was set in 2003 when a paper leak forced the authorities to cancel CAT. In any case, nobody should complain because all students have prepared hard for the exam and thats not going to change. If a pen-and-paper test is held, at least all students will have a fair shot at it, said Kaushik Kapoor of Erudite, a city-based coaching centre.        
	A delay in rescheduling tests that couldnt be held or completed because of technical reasons over the first five days  a 10-day window has been fixed for online CAT  added to the confusion among students.        
	Prometric, the service provider entrusted with conducting online CAT, issued a statement saying that exam dates had been rescheduled for 62 per cent of the candidates whose tests were cancelled over Saturday and Sunday. But a student whose scheduled test on Sunday was postponed said he and most of his classmates were still awaiting word from Prometric.        
	Over 72 hours have elapsed since tests were cancelled on Sunday and those who have not received fresh slots are getting anxious, said Naveen Saraff of Career Launcher.        
	Prometric had emailed a few students on Tuesday, saying that their tests slated for December 6  the penultimate day of the 10-day window  had been rescheduled. The mail also said that the agency would contact them later for details.        
	When I called them up to enquire about the change, I was told that the mail was generated because of a glitch and that my test was going to be held as scheduled, said a candidate.        
	Another student said that the last thing Prometric should have done at this stage was to generate a mail by mistake.        
	My semester exam starts on Monday and I am worried about the rescheduled CAT date clashing, he added.

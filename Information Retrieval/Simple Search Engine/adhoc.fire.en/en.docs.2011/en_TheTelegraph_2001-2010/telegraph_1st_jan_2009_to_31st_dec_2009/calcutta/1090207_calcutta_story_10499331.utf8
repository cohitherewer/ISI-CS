The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | World of myths
                                                                                                                   World of myths
                              Students of Silver Point High School perform during their annual concert. Picture by Anindya Shankar Ray                        
	A colourful mosaic of plays, dances and musical performances marked the sixth Winterfest of The Cambridge School (TCS), held on January 31 at Uttam Mancha. The theme was Mythasia.         
	The chief guest was actor Sabyasachi Chakraborty. First up was a skit on The Ramayana by kindergarten children. From Jatayu, who so enjoyed his fight with Ravana that he refused to die, to Ram and Ravana holding onto to their dangerously-close-to-coming-undone dhotis, the TCS tots were adorable.         
	The Junior School enacted a Thai myth about a sunbird imprisoned by a neurotic king and then freed by some kids. The middle school staged a Korean myth about the origin of the sun and moon.         
	The senior school presented The Sign, whose message was to save the environment. Class XI took the audience to Judgment Day with their play, The Apocalypse. The show came full circle with A2 (Class XII) going back to the epics and giving voice to Sita and Draupadi and the injustice they faced.

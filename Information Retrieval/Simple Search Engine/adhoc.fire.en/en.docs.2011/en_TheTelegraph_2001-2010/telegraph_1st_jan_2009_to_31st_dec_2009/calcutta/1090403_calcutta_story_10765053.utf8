The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Masters course in dentistry
                                                                                                               Masters course in dentistry
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A dental college in Panihati has become the first private institution in eastern India to offer the Master of Dental Surgery (MDS) course.        
	The Guru Nanak Institute of Dental Sciences and Research received the Dental Council of Indias nod on Thursday to start the three-year course from May 2. Each batch will have 19 seats.        
	In the Masters course, the options for specialisation includes prosthodontics, orthodontics, periodontics, conservative dentistry, oral and maxillofacial surgery, oral pathology and pedodontics.        
	India, especially the eastern region, lacks enough dentists. The institute will help bridge the gap, Dibyendu Majumder, a member of the executive council of the Dental Council of India, said at the inauguration of the course.        
	Majumder, also the principal of the state-run R Ahmed Dental College (which offers the MDS programme), feels the course at the Panihati institute will help general category students.        
	There are 26 MDS seats in our college, of which 13 are filled by the Centre with students clearing an all-India test. Quite a few of the rest are reserved for SC, ST and OBC candidates, he said.        
	Sources said a state-run dental college will be commissioned in Burdwan by the end of 2009. It will be the fifth dental college in the state. Karnataka has more than 40 such colleges, and UP and Kerala, 22 and 18, respectively, said the source.

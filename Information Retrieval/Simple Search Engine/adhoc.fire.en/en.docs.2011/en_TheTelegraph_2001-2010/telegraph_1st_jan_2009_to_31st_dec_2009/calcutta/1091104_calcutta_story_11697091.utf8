	Police have drawn a traffic diversion plan for AJC Bose Road, set to take effect from the weekend, to facilitate the construction of a north-bound ramp of the flyover at the Beckbagan end.        
	Work on the 425m-long ramp, which will take off from a spot close to the AJC Bose Road-Theatre Road crossing, was twice deferred last year. The project cost has been estimated at Rs 18 crore.        
	Its not clear yet how long the diversion will remain in force for the police and HRBC, the executing agency of the project, are speaking in different voices.        
	Deputy commissioner (traffic) Dilip Banerjee said the authorities have been asked to wrap up work before the exam season begins in February.        
	But HRBC vice-chairman Sadhan Banerjee clarified that even if work progressed unhindered, it would take at least a year to complete the ramp.        
	Officers privy to the diversion plan said north-bound cars, taxis and two-wheelers plying down AJC Bose Road would be stopped at the Rawdon Street crossing.        
	From 7am to 1 pm, the vehicles would take Camac Street or Rawdon Street before hitting AJC Bose Road again through Theatre Road. Post-1pm, the vehicles will be diverted to Park Street through Rawdon Street before heading for AJC Bose Road.        
	The increased traffic volume on Rawdon Street will add to the chaos around the La Martiniere schools, admitted an officer.        
	As for buses and minibuses, the north-bound ones will not be allowed to enter AJC Bose Road from the Exide crossing once the diversion takes effect, said an officer. They will proceed to Esplanade down JL Nehru Road. Shyambazar-bound buses from Ballygunge Circular Road and Sarat Bose Road will turn left after hitting AJC Bose Road and then head north down JL Nehru Road.

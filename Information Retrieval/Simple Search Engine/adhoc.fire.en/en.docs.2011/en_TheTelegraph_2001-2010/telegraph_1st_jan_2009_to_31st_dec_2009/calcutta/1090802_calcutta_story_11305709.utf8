The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Do not fall asleep
                                                                                                               Do not fall asleep
										      stage                        Ghumiye Porona Plz being staged. (Bishwarup Dutta)				                           
	Every displacement leaves a mark on the mind. The protagonists of Ghumiye Porona Plz are left sleepless after a park bench is removed and the park turned into a mall.         
	Presenting the play at Oxford Bookstore on July 29 was Theatron X, which has performed four original productions in the Third Theatre style after their debut (Ebong Indrajit at the same venue in 2007). The group has held low-price ticketed shows at Padatik Buildwell, Star and Sujata Sadan. Ghumiye Porona Plz, written by Sayan Dasgupta, talks about the metamorphosis of two idealistic teenage lovers into a middle-aged couple in a world of hypocrisy and compromise.         
	Bred on Tagore, Jibanananda Das, Joy Goswami, songs of Suman Chattopadhyay, Anjan Dutta and Chandrabindu, the couple must now deal with poverty, political protests, police action, social antagonism and the flurry of real estate activity.         
	The play uses minimum props, narrators and live music, and two sets of actors for the couple past and present. Though they still have a long way to go, it is encouraging to find a group that is trying to make financially sustainable theatre that takes into account contemporary realities.         
	NSD workshop        
	All these years, it occurred to no one to remove the wings and curtains of Girish Mancha and use the entire space. This was done at the ongoing production-design workshop held by the National School of Drama (NSD) with the support of the state Natya Akademi.         
	The 21-day workshop will conclude on August 3 with two short presentations, one an interpretation of Nirendranath Chakrabortys poems and the other a presentation of excerpts from Raktakarabi on a set that may cost Rs 3-4 lakh. The enthusiasm of the 21 participants (aged 18-40) from the city and the districts was heartwarming.         
	Classes were held from 8am to 9pm daily at Jatra Mancha and Girish Mancha by the NSD faculty. City theatre personalities such as Nilkantho Sengupta, Ashok Mukhopadhyay and Usha Ganguly helped out.       SEBANTI SARKAR

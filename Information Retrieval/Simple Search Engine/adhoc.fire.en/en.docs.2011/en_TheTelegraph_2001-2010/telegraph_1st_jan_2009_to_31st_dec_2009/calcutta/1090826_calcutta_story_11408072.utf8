                                                                                                               Robbery suspects confess to murder
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two youths caught by pedestrians while trying to snatch a chain from a girl at Chatterjeehat, Howrah, on Monday night, confessed to a kidnap-and-murder during interrogation.        
	Rajib Dutta, 25, and Bikki Shaw, 24, were produced in the chief judicial magistrates court in Howrah on Tuesday and remanded in police custody for four days.        
	The two residents of Nepali Basti, near Shalimar station, had allegedly kidnapped their 20-year-old neighbour Mintu Yadav from the Howrah court premises on June 8, shot him and dumped the body near Sankrail station.        
	Initially, the police had only suspected the two of being involved in a series of snatchings in Howrah over the past few months.        
	We were concentrating only on the snatchings. But since the duo hail from Nepali Basti, we asked them about Yadav. We had no clue that he had been murdered. But to our astonishment the duo confessed to kidnapping and murdering the youth, said an investigating officer of Shibpur police station.        
	The body was found near Sankrail station on June 9. But the victims identity could not ascertained till Dutta and Shaw gave a blow-by-blow account of the murder, added the officer.         
	The police took a picture of the body to Yadavs house, where his family members identified him.        
	Hari Kishore Kusumakar, the superintendent of Howrah police, said: A preliminary investigation suggested that the youth was killed over a monetary dispute.         
	Raju, Mintus elder brother, said: I have Rajibs cellphone number. I had called him and asked him about my brother but he denied any knowledge about him.         
	The cops suspect that Dutta and Shaw had fired at a pedestrian on Grand Foreshore Road on Sunday morning when he tried to resist a bid by them to snatch a womans gold chain.

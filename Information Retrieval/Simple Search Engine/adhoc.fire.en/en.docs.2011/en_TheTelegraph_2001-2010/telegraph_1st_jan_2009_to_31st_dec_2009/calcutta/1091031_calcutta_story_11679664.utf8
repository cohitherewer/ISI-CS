The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rap on govt for slap in class 
                                                                                                               Rap on govt for slap in class 
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta High Court has hauled up the government for not circulating an order banning corporal punishment, giving schools the bureaucratic escape route of not adhering to the ban because they havent been officially intimated about it.        
	 The state government has failed to put a stop to corporal punishment in schools, the division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice B. Somadder said on Friday, referring to the spate of complaints being lodged against teachers in recent years.         
	When the division bench asked the director of school education, Dibyen Mukherjee, whether copies of the court order issued in 2006 had been circulated, he replied that educational institutions couldnt claim they hadnt heard about the ban.                What is corporal punishment?
  lsquo;Corporal rsquo; means lsquo;physical rsquo;. So corporal punishment denotes punishing someone using physical force   What constitutes corporal punishment in the eyes of the law?
  Any physical punishment is corporal punishment, however light it may be        
	Corporal punishment has been banned in Bengal, and we have reiterated it several times by means of issuing circulars. A circular reiterating the ban was last issued in January. The circular, according to government rules, is first sent to the district inspectors of schools, who are responsible for distributing copies among all the institutions under their jurisdiction, Mukherjee added.        
	But the judges insisted that the buck stopped at the government when it came to ensuring that the courts order was implemented.        
	In 2006, the high court had ruled that corporal punishment be treated as a criminal offence and that classroom punishment leading to death be regarded as culpable homicide (not amounting to murder). The maximum sentence for the second offence is life imprisonment.        
	The earlier rule was to book someone accused of corporal punishment leading to death under Section 304A of the IPC, which pertains to causing death by negligence and attracts a lesser sentence.        
	In 2008, Iftesham Chowdhury, a Class II student of Vidya Bharati School in Mominpur, died after being slapped so hard by her yoga teacher that her head rammed against a wall. Going by the 2006 ruling, the accused was to be booked under Section 304 but she was charged under Section 304A and granted bail.        
	The lawyer who had filed the PIL based on which the 2006 order was issued said in court on Friday that he visited several schools in the city and discovered that some werent even aware of the ban.        
	But the principals of most schools said corporal punishment didnt exist in their institutions, ban or no ban.        
	A ban is not enough to stop the menace; so we lay more emphasis on making teachers tolerant towards students, said Terence Ireland, the principal of St James School.

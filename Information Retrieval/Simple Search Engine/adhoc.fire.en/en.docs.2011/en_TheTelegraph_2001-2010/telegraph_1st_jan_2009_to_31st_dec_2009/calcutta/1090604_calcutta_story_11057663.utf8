                                                                                                               Toddler crushed by wheels
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 13-month-old boy was crushed under the wheels of a trailer on Coal Berth Road on Wednesday morning.        
	Aryan Balwant, a resident of a slum in the locality, was playing beside the road around 9.25am when the mishap occurred. The child died on the spot, his head crushed. The body has been sent for post-mortem, said an officer of South Port police station.        
	The driver has been arrested and the vehicle impounded. The driver has claimed that he did not notice that the child had come under the wheels, the officer added.        
	Aryans father Subhas, who works in a private godown in the area, was at work while Rekha was busy cooking when the mishap occurred.        
	A group of residents tried to block the stretch to protest rash driving but the cops rushed to the spot and brought the situation under control.        
	Policing is lax here though many goods vehicles ply on the stretch. The few cops who are posted here are more interested in pocketing bribes from drivers, said Shankar Shaw, a local resident.

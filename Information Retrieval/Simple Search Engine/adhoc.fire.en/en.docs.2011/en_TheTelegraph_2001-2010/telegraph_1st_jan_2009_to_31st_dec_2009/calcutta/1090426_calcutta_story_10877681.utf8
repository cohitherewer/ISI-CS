The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | TOP GEAR
                                                                                                               TOP GEAR
          Most premium car brands do not have showrooms in Calcutta. But there is a home-delivery system                                                
	Govind Pasrachia (name changed), 32, wanted a BMW. He used to drive a Mercedes SLK bought from Interkrafts, Calcuttas Merc dealer, about a year back. All was fine with it but Pasrachia, fickle as car lovers often are, wanted to try out a BMW sports car. The BMW dealer in the city said there would be a waiting period of two months before it could deliver a 650i, the BMW convertible that Govind wanted.         
	I got in touch with a direct selling agent operating in the city, who got me a second-hand 650i from Chennai that had run only 3,500km and was as good as new, says Pasrachia, who sold his Merc through them too.         
	Now he wants a Porsche, a brand new one. Soon. He will get it. I want a Porsche Boxster Sport and Im going to buy one within a month, he says. The agent is going to get him the Rs 62-lakh car from Precision Cars, the Porsche importers in Delhi.         
	Calcutta is deprived of most good brands and premium cars are no exception. Even an Audi or a Nissan does not have representatives in the city, though Audi has a showroom in Kochi and Nissan at Secunderabad. Yet you can get any car of your fantasy  even a Ferrari if you want, only it has to be imported  sitting right in Calcutta, through the agents.         
	There are two major agents operating in the city, Speed Inc. and Marks N Glix, who have tie-ups with dealers in Mumbai and Delhi. They will get any model of your choice within seven days from date of payment, after, of course, making a packet for themselves.         
	Its easy. In case of upfront cash payment, you provide address proof, photocopies of the PAN card and photographs. And in case you want to get your car financed, two years I-T returns, six months bank statements, along with post-dated cheques or ECS will do, informs Abhishek Daga of Marks N Glix. Looks as simple as well, buying a Maruti. It is, actually, if you dont look at the damages.         
	Like other car sellers, the agents also help with the loans. Finance options for premium cars that are priced Rs 27 lakh onwards are available with the agents themselves, as they are agents of financial institutions too. Adarsh Tulshan of Speed Inc. had started out as a car financier.         
	We are ready to provide loan up to 90 per cent. On an average, EMIs for such exclusive cars can vary from anything between Rs 55,000 to Rs 1,55,000 depending on the down payment. We generally do a five-year loan tenure, says Tulshan.         
	Personal care         
	Once the payment reaches the dealer in Delhi or Mumbai, your dream vehicle is loaded into a trailer truck and the agent delivers it at your doorstep. A temporary registration for one month is done by the dealer from whom the car is bought. Once it comes here we do the permanent registration and the insurance before we deliver to our client, says Tulshan.         
	However, for models like Ferrari, Aston Martin or Hummer, for which there are no representatives in the country, the agents are ready to import them for you from dealerships in the nearest country.         
	Tulshan has imported a Hummer H3 for a client in Calcutta from the US, where the car is made. All the paperwork for the import was handled by us. The price in dollars was remitted to the Hummer dealer in Los Angeles and the car was shipped to the Mumbai port. We cleared the customs duty for the client and the car was delivered to him in Calcutta, says Tulshan.                 How to get the hottest model             A Ferrari Enzo

	Calcutta of late has seen a number of premium vehicles on roads. It started during the third quarter of 2006 when BMW came to the country, but the company only opened its showroom in the city in March 2008 on the EM Bypass.         
	Between 2006 and 2008, Speed Inc. sold 45 BMWs, priced between Rs 27 lakh and Rs 80 lakh.         
	Owning exclusive premium cars much before the rest even get to see the vehicles gives a certain high to Tulshans select list of clients.         
	Its basically getting to own cars that are not available in the city that drives my clients to buy from me. They cannot wait for the cars to arrive here so I get them from other cities, he says.         
	They are also notorious for switching loyalty to the next big model.         
	They keep the cars for a few months or a few years before they sell them to upgrade to the next premium vehicle, says Tulshan. This keeps the business going for Speed Inc., which charges its clients the Delhi or Mumbai ex-showroom price of the vehicle, along with the transportation cost that varies between Rs 25,000 and Rs 35,000 and the registration and insurance fees.         
	Such exclusive clients will not just expect doorstep delivery, but also a smooth after-sales service. Having tied up with BMW dealers like Bird Automative and Deutsche Motoren in Delhi, Speed Inc. says it has tried to ensure that its clients get the after-sales service a BMW customer is entitled to.         
	Its a lot less hassle if one goes through an agent, said a Speed Inc. client. He was one of a group of four friends who bought a BMW 5 series each from Tulshan before the company showroom came up.         
	For small-time services like cleaning air filters, denting, painting, Tulshans workshop at Shyambazar near Khanna cinema suffices. But for any technical glitch or accident repairs, technicians from the dealerships fly down for repairs and the cost is borne by the dealer if it is within the warranty period, says Tulshan.         
	Daga swears by his after-sales service. One of the Audi A4s that I sold in December, developed a snag. My client called me on a Saturday afternoon. I immediately called the dealer up in Mumbai, who sent a trailer to pick up the car and had it delivered to the Audi workshop in Hyderabad that same day. After it was repaired, Audi flew the owner to Hyderabad and back at company expense for him to check his car before sending it back to Calcutta!         
	However, all the BMW activity came to a halt for Speed Inc once the company showroom came up in March 2008. Says Anjan Mukherjee, General Manager of OSL Prestige, the BMW dealers: They made a killing before we arrived. But they cannot sell new BMWs from their Delhi dealers anymore.         
	Showroom share        
	Mukherjee is critical of the agents. Its a bit risky buying from agents as they cannot provide our level of service. We have our own workshop and technicians trained by the company to handle such precision cars. Besides, the pre-delivery inspection is not done properly.         
	Speed Inc. is now on to supplying Audis and has been joined by Marks N Glix in this race. Since April 2007, Speed Inc has delivered 14 Audis  six A4s (Rs 30-32 lakh), six A6s (Rs 38-Rs 49 lakh) and two Q7s (Rs 60 lakh).         
	Marks N Glix has sold 10 A4s and 3 A6s and one Q7 in the last four months, says Daga, who also did a roaring business supplying Volkswagen vehicles before the company showroom came up.         
	Between August 2008 to March 2009, when the Volkswagen dealership opened, we sold 10 Jettas for Rs 12 lakh each and 2 Passats for Rs 26 lakh, says Daga. Here he scores over his rival by absorbing the transportation cost from Delhi, which is nearly Rs 40,000.         
	I retain my customer base because of the service I render. I give them a better exchange facility, most of my customers are upgrading to premium cars and so I buy their old vehicles at a good deal. I give them better finance options and better discounts, said the young entrepreneur. He says his commission ranges between Rs 2,000 and Rs 10,000 but later admits for premium vehicles it starts from Rs 10,000.         
	The city is likely to get more authorised showrooms of premium brands, but the agents, it seems, are here to stay with their exclusive client database. In fact, not all dealers are hostile towards them. Some, such as Hiteswar Singh of Interkrafts, the sole Merc dealer in the city, sees them as an extension of the dealer network.         
	The agents can work in conjunction with the dealerships. Particularly brands that are not represented in the city can use the agents database and it is mutually beneficial.  
	all in one for auto-lovers            A BMW at Speed Inc.            An Audi at Marks N Glix       
	It rsquo;s being touted as the city rsquo;s first multi-brand auto showroom. The new outlet of Marks N Glix, spread over 15,000 sq ft on Syed Amir Ali Avenue, is supposed to be a one-stop shop for car aficionados. Sell your old car, buy a new one, get it financed, get it accessorised and drive away. That rsquo;s how Marks N Glix is positioning its open-air   outlet in Ballygunge.   
	 The concept of a multi-brand showroom-cum-service centre was popularised by former Maruti Udyog MD Jagdish Khattar, who after hanging up his boots, set up Carnation, a retail chain offering auto solutions across the country. With four showrooms in Noida, Amritsar and two in Mumbai, Carnations is planning to foray into Hyderabad, Chennai and open more outlets in Noida and Mumbai. But Calcutta is not yet showing on Carnation rsquo;s roadmap.   
	 So till it arrives, Calcuttans will have to make do with Marks N Glix, which opened on Poila Baisakh eve. The open-air space holds about 50 cars, both old and new. The second-hand cars are between five months and five years old and are being sold at the current market value with 20 per cent depreciation.   
	 Along with the car display is a 5,000 sq ft workshop, but it is the accessories shop that draws the crowds. From nifty can coolers for Rs 3,500 to sophisticated car audios like the Alpine six DVD in-dash system for Rs 1,25,000, a car lover has everything here: car fridges, sun roofs, security systems, HID lamps, butterfly doors, spoilers and seat covers...

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Watch out for calamity cloud   Turbulence terror in   the skies
                                                                                                               Watch out for calamity cloud     - Thunderstorm that felled Air France craft common over our skies          SANJAY MANDAL                          French army air crewmen patrol the presumed site of the crash of the missing Air France flight over the central Atlantic. (AP)                                        
	Captain Chetan Shah must have got the jitters when he heard about the Air France crash on Monday.        
	For he was the commandant of a Jet Airways flight from Calcutta to Mumbai that flew straight into a thunderstorm  quite like the one that probably felled the flight over the Atlantic  on April 12, 2007, with 160 passengers on board.        
	Pilots know that a thunderstorm is common over our skies at this time of the year. But Captain Shah knows more about it than he would have ever liked to.        
	The presence of a 17km tall column of cumulonimbus cloud bearing charged particles, some of more than 1,000 volts, enough to electrocute the plane, was not monitored on his weather radar screen in the cockpit, recounted an official of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) official, which had conducted a probe into the close shave.        
	The aircraft flew straight into it a few minutes after take-off and was facing severe turbulence. It was so severe that he thought it was the end, the official added.        
	Shah had cried May Day to the Calcutta Air Traffic Control (ATC) while turning the aircraft, a Boeing 737, left and steering it out of the cloud. Then he told the ATC that the emergency was cancelled.        
	There is frequent formation of cumulonimbus clouds (tall, dense and dangerous) in Bengal, especially in the pre-monsoon period from April to June, said a senior official of Calcutta airports Met department.                                      
	Thunderstorms are regular features and can be dangerous for flight movements, he admitted.        
	So what is done to ensure flight safety? A Doppler Radar perched on the rooftop of the New Secretariat building and a storm detection radar at the airport record the formation of cumulonimbus clouds, distance from the airport, altitude of its base and tip from the ground level. These are sent to each airline and the Air Traffic Control (ATC).         
	A pilot or his representative takes a Met briefing, studying the weather condition of the base and destination. The weather condition of the route and the proposed alternative route are also studied, said a senior Air India pilot.        
	The ATC also warns the pilot of any possible rough weather through voice communication. In case a pilot faces abrupt rough weather, he takes a deviation and informs the ATC about it, an ATC official said.        
	Sometimes, the thunderstorm is perilously close. On June 6, 2006, a Jet Airways flight from Mumbai to Calcutta was struck by lightning while passing through a thunderstorm. There were blisters on the aircrafts body but fortunately, no electrical equipment was damaged, the DGCA official said.        
	According to Met officials, the cumulonimbus cloud can form alone, in clusters, or along a cold front in a squall line. If any aircraft is caught inside the cloud then it faces severe turbulence, caused by up and down draughts, said an official.        
	The charged particles inside the cloud are most dangerous. If hit by the particles, a planes communication and electrical equipment can be damaged, he added.

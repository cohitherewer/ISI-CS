	Freud spent a lifetime analysing dreams and reading the mind. Madhu Tandan, who recently launched her second book Dreams amp; Beyond, Finding your way in the Dark, also dabbles in dreams.        
	Tandan has conducted many workshops and presented papers on dreams. Introducing her book at the Oxford Bookstore, she said dreams are an extension of the mind and presented several case studies and interpreted the metaphors.         
	One study was of an artist, who was single and whose parents were pressing her to get married. She met the prospective groom but told him that painting was her topmost priority. The man had still wanted to marry her.         
	The artist then had a dream that she couldnt cross a road to reach a Shiva temple. Lord Hanuman was lying across the road, preventing her from crossing it. As Lord Shiva beckoned at her to cross the road, Lord Hanuman moved away.         
	Tandan said the dream was a reflection of the artists confusion over marriage. While Lord Shiva was the metaphor for conjugal life, Lord Hanuman symbolised bachelorhood.         
	The dream, according to Tandan, was exhorting the artist to abandon bachelorhood and opt for a happy married life.         
	The bottom line  if you are confused about something, simple, just go to sleep!        
	Schools in Darj        
	A slim volume on the oldest boarding schools in Darjeeling can help a parent decide on a school of choice in one of the most renowned education hubs of the country.         
	The St Pauls and the Loreto Convents in Darj were much sought-after institutions, particularly for the children of the well-heeled.         
	But today with equally plush boarding schools coming up in and around Delhi, these old-world schools have stiff competition.         
	Debarshi Roy, a management professional in school administration based in Siliguri, has spent much time taking photographs of these picturesque buildings, which are so representative of colonial architecture, and talking to the current principals.         
	He has compiled all this in Growing with the Himalayas, a book that recounts the history and hardships of the founding members of these elite schools.         
	Nuggets of information like Vivien Leighs stint at Loreto Convent Darjeeling make it an interesting read.

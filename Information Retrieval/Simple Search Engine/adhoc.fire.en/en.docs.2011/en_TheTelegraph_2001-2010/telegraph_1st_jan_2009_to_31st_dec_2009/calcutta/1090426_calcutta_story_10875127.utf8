The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Summer manners
                                                                                                               Summer manners
										      As the April heat bakes the city, Metro lists a few summer rules.      caleidoscope                                          
	Do not rub thy sweaty arms against anyone        
	One mans perspiration is definitely not anothers perfume. Rubbing your melting arms against the person next to you is an offence. Carry a dozen handkerchiefs. Wrap yourself in wet tissue rolls and audition for horror film roles.         
	Do not push and shove        
	We know old habits die hard, but try kicking it this summer! Minimise body contact everywhere, especially in queues.         
	Bring on sweat-resistant cellphones        
	Dear cellphone gurus, could we please have a summer special please? With the perspiration flowing freely, talking over the cellphone is like fielding on a wet outfield. Dangerous. Sweaty palms add to the misery. Texting too can be a slippery affair. We could do with a phone that would absorb perspiration.         
	Do not play songs loudly, in the Metro, in the auto, in the bus         
	With the heat taking a toll on your body and brain, you dont want hot numbers like Desi girl, Humma humma, or Suroor playing on the FM. Ask your co-passenger to get himself an iPod. Try to avoid the neighbourhood of noisy kids.         
	Change office hours        
	Try to convince the office management to start work in the evening and go on till midnight.         
	Wear: Less clothes        
	Watch: The Guide. Vijay Anands adaptation of RK Narayans novel featuring his brother Dev Anand is a lot less subtle than the book, but in it you have an emaciated Dev Anand (though the tall cone of his hair is still in place), dreaming of rain-drenched hills with his head on Wahida Rahmans lap, as the villagers celebrate the onset of monsoon. Watch it for Wahida. She is cool.        
	Or watch The Rainmaker, the story of Bill Starbuck (Burt Lancaster) and Lizzie Curry (Katharine Hepburn). Bill enters the drought-ridden town where Lizzie resides with the claims of being a professional rainmaker, but transforms the life of the plain old-maid Lizzie.         
	If you are left wanting more, catch Nana Patekar and Anita Desai in The Rainmakers Hindi take, Thoda sa rumani ho jaye.         
	Read: Gabriel Garcia Marquezs One Hundred Years of Solitude. Watch it rain for four years, 11 months and two days in Macondo. Watch it sweep away rails, open graves, destroy the town, change lives forever        
	Saionee Chakraborty and Poulomi Banerjee

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The Centre on Monday issued an alert on possible terrorist strikes on trains in the city during Durga puja. Following the alert, the railway and West Bengal police announced special measures to step up security at Howrah, Sealdah and other stations in and around Calcutta.         
	The Union home ministry alerted the additional director-general of police (railways) Dilip Mitra about the possible attacks on trains and bomb blasts using cars. The ADG has informed us about the alert and we have asked the railway authorities to take necessary security measures, chief secretary Ashok Mohan Chakrabarti said at Writers Buildings on Monday.        
	Security personnel have been asked to keep vigil on long distance and local trains. Thousands of people take the local trains during Puja and the railway have been asked to ensure the security of passengers, he added.        
	ADG Mitra said measures were being taken to ensure security and safety of passengers on trains. During Puja, trains are one of the principal modes of commuting and we are taking maximum care to protect passengers and railway properties, he said.        
	Sources said additional GRP and RPF personnel would be deployed at all busy stations in and around the city. Sniffer dogs from the RPFs bomb detection squads would be deployed at stations. Local trains would also be thoroughly scanned, a railway official said.        
	Security officers with metal detectors and plainclothesmen would patrol stations. All luggage will be scanned manually, a railway official said. A sweeping squad would be deployed to detect any unclaimed baggage on platforms or trains and officers would keep an eye on key stations using closed-circuit television cameras.        
	Railway officials said on a weekday the total footfall at Howrah and Sealdah stations is around 16 lakh. During Puja, it increases by 20 per cent, an official said.

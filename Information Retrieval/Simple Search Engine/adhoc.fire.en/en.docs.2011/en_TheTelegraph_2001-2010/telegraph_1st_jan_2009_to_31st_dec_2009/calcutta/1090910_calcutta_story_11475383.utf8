The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Summon over pandal
                                                                                                               Summon over pandal
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Wednesday directed the director-general of fire services to appear before it and clarify his submission that a Kasba pandal had left 4ft free on its side when the space was narrower.         
	Rishav Medora, a special officer appointed by the court, earlier told Justice Sanjib Banerjee that the organisers of the puja on RK Chatterjee Road had left only 37 inches free between their pandal and the house of Ishita Chakraborty, who had moved a plea.        
	There was only a 6-inch gap between the pandal and the three houses opposite Chakrabortys residence, added Medora.        
	The judge had asked the puja organiser to demolish the illegal portions of its pandal and directed the fire services to check whether it was done.        
	It seems the organiser re-modelled the pandal according to the instructions of the fire services, said the judge on Wednesday.

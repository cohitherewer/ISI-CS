The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sweet surge beats bitter price pill
                                                                                                               Sweet surge beats bitter price pill
  - Mithai costs 20 per cent more, box bears tags to cash in on festive flow          POULOMI BANERJEE                                                  
	Sweets are to Diwali what gold is to Dhanteras, must-buys despite spiralling prices.        
	The Paschim Bangiya Mistanna Byabsayee Samity allowed a 20 per cent hike in prices from October 1, to give mithai makers a chance to beat the blues and cash in on the festive frenzy at sweet shops. It was decided that since the price of the ingredients has gone up, the price of the sweets should be increased, said Ramjee Chaurasia, the president of the association and owner of Ganguram Sweets.        
	But sweet buyers bracing for steep festive prices must also guard against an aftertaste of bitter bewilderment left by boxes that come with a price tag. The same amount of sweets from Haldiram that cost me Rs 400 in the Diwali week last year, cost me over Rs 500 on Wednesday. But what really stumped me was that the box itself cost Rs 25, said S. Agarwal, a doctor in south Calcutta.        
	For our festive boxes we charge Rs 12-25, said Arup Kumar Gupta of Haldiram. Packaging has become a product now, with its cost going up by 20-22 per cent.        
	Despite the price barrier, Asish Agarwal of Bhikaram Chandmal is bullish about sales as the willingness to spend, especially when it comes to corporate gifts, is back after a dull Diwali 2008. The price of raw materials has gone up sharply  sugar has tripled in the last 10 days, mewa has gone up by 20 per cent with rising demand, he says, justifying the increased cost to the consumer.        
	The pocket pinch for the buyer is matched by that for the seller, protest sweet shops. We usually aim for a 12-15 per cent profit, but owing to the rising cost of making the sweets it has dropped to 7-8 per cent, said Rajesh Gupta of Gupta Brothers, where prices of popular picks (see box) have been raised by 10-15 per cent.        
	Ram Lal Tewari blames the 10 per cent rise in mithai-samosa prices at Tewari Brothers on vital ingredients like sugar, ghee, potato, besan becoming costlier, but is confident of sales not suffering. The recession monster has been slayed and so despite rising prices mithai buying is a must this Diwali, smiled Tewari loyalist Ajay Khaitan.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Clear the smokescreen to clean air
                                                                                                               Clear the smokescreen to clean air
										      JAYANTA BASU      TT CITY FOR FOUL FUME                            WHEEL DEAL: There is a move to allow 2-stroke autos and old commercial buses to remain on the road beyond July 31                                
	Last week saw two developments on the foul-fume front  the government initiated a hush-hush move to convert two-stroke autos to LPG and a division bench of Calcutta High Court ruled in favour of Modern High School for Girls converting five of its old buses to LPG.        
	Does this mean that all old and polluting autos and buses can remain on the road simply by converting to LPG?        
	Metro peers through the smokescreen and decodes the conversion confusion surrounding three-wheelers and buses, so that Calcuttans are not taken for a ride yet again.               
	Q: What is the high court order pertaining to phasing out of autos?        
	A: On July 18, 2008, the high court ordered phasing out of all 2-stroke autos by December 31. This deadline was pushed back to July 31, 2009, following government pleas. As things stand, only 4-stroke single-mode LPG autos can ply on city roads from August 1.                
	Q: What is the status of the phaseout?        
	A: Apart from banning registration of new 2-stroke autos, the government has done precious little. Hardly 2,000 2-stroke autos have been replaced with 4-stroke single mode LPG ones this year, against the target of 2,500-3,000 replacements every month. Unions of all political hues are demanding that 2-stroke autos  constituting more than 95 per cent of the citys fleet  be allowed to convert to LPG and run. The government has made a hush-hush move to allow that, while also officially announcing a crackdown against erring autos from July 25.              
	Q: What is the problem with 2-stroke autos in Calcutta?        
	A: Old 2-stroke autos remain Calcuttas polluter number one, accounting for one-third of its overall pollution load. An Asian Development Bank study revealed four years back that about 97 per cent of the citys 3-wheeler fleet was more than 10 years old.              
	Q: What is the national norm for old autos?        
	A: Nowhere are autos more than 15 years old allowed to run. In July 1998, Supreme Court had directed that all pre-1990 autos  meaning more than eight years old  be replaced with new CNG vehicles. In 2001, Bombay High Court  based on recommendations of a court-appointed committee  directed that all autos between 8 and 15 years be either converted to LPG/CNG or be scrapped.              
	Q: What can the government do now?        
	A: It should ideally scrap all 2-stroke autos  amounting to 70,000-plus  and take a decisive step towards cleaning up the citys air. But chances are it will not risk the union-fired chaos that such a move will trigger on the streets. So, it could refer to the 1998 Supreme Court ruling and plead for conversion of 2-stroke autos less than 10 years old to LPG.              
	Q: What is the government trying to deflect attention from in the auto case?        
	A: The fact that the high court had in the July 2008 order told police to immediately slam the brakes on all unauthorised autos and put an end to the sale of adulterated fuel. A year on, at least half the auto fleet remains unauthorised  there has been negligible seizure thanks to some political patronage or the other  and most 2-stroke autos run on katatel.        
	Q: What is the high court order pertaining to phasing out of old buses?        
	A: On July 18, 2008, the high court ordered phasing out of all buses  used commercially  more than 15 years old (registered before January 1, 1993) and replaced by new vehicles with Bharat Stage-III mass emission standard. Buses contribute two-third of respirable particulate matter (RPM) and close to three-fourth of nitrogen oxides in the citys poison air.              
	Q: What was the plea of Modern High School for Girls?        
	A: The reputable school pleaded that five of its buses, more than 15 years old, be spared the chop on July 31, as they were in good condition and they were not being used as commercial vehicles.              
	Q: What did the court rule?         
	A: The division bench on Friday allowed Modern High School to convert its five old diesel buses to LPG, but did not rule on their commercial status. The state advocate general present in court readily agreed to give the school time for conversion.              
	Q: Why is the proposed conversion a hot potato?        
	A: Conversion of a bus  leave alone a school bus  from diesel to LPG has no precedent, and so there is no defined safety or emission standard set for the same, and also no approval from the Automotive Research Association of India. Even if by some unproven technology the conversion is effected, under what motor vehicles writ will the buses be allowed to run on the road? And who will bear the cross if there is a mishap?              
	Q: What is the national norm on phasing out of old buses?        
	A: Supreme Court had in July 1998, directed that all commercial buses in Delhi  including school buses  be phased out once they crossed the 15-year-old barrier.              
	Q: What can the green lobby do now?        
	A: It can raise the Supreme Court rulings on autos and buses to ensure that the government cannot provide an escape route to old vehicles.

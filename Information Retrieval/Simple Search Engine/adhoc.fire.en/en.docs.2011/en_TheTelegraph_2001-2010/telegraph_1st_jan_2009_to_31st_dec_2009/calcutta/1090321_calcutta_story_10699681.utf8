	Salt Lake resident Kanchan Nandi, 48, and his 14-year-old daughter Nilanjana were cremated in Siliguri on Friday, a day after their family of three met with a car crash on their way to Lava in north Bengal.        
	Nandis wife Maya and the driver of the Maruti Alto they were travelling in, Prasad Sarkar, were admitted to a nursing home with multiple injuries.        
	Nandi, a PWD engineer, and Nilanjana were cremated at Kiranchandra Crematorium after post-mortem at the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital on Friday afternoon.        
	Swapan Moitra, Nandis brother-in-law, and Shyamasri Basu, Mayas sister, reached Siliguri on Friday morning from Calcutta and after consulting with other relatives, decided to perform the last rites there.         
	After we received news of the accident, we immediately left for Siliguri. We are still in a state of shock, said Moitra in Siliguri.         
	The Nandi family had arrived in Siliguri on Thursday from Calcutta and left for Lava by road in the afternoon. Their car collided with a lorry at 10th Mile on NH31A.        
	Mayas uncle, Chanchal Choudhury said he had spoken to the doctor attending to his niece on Friday morning. The doctor said she was recovering and we all hope she gets well soon, Choudhury said.        
	Ranjan Palchoudhury, the surgeon on duty at the nursing home where Maya and Sarkar have been admitted, said their condition was stable.        
	We shifted Sarkar from the intensive care unit to the general ward on Friday. But we are keeping Maya under close observation and she is still in the ICU. She may require a minor operation, Palchoudhury said.

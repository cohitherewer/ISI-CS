  - Hawkers amp; caterers charged with Maidan assault        OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          Food being cooked on the Maidan during the DYFI rally in December. A Telegraph picture                                        
	Hawkers and caterers, not cadres, mauled the Maidan during the December 20 rally organised by the CPMs youth wing, police claimed in an affidavit to the high court on Friday.        
	 A pack of lies, responded green activist Subhas Dutta, whose petition had prompted the court to ask for the affidavit.        
	The police said five persons were arrested and three LPG cylinders and an oven were seized during the rally, which had brought over 1.5 lakh activists of the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) to the Maidan. Taking advantage of the huge gathering at the Brigade Parade Ground, hawkers and people in the catering business sold cooked foodThe police immediately took action and arrested them.                   
	The government advocate said a large police contingent, including senior officers, had been deployed that day to enforce the ban on cooking in the open within three kilometres of Victoria Memorial and parking close to the Maidan. Announcements were made through the public address system to make everybody aware about the directives of the high court and warn that violators would be arrested/prosecuted.         
	The affidavit did not mention food being cooked in chullahs or vehicles being parked on the greens during the DYFI rally.         
	Dutta, who had backed his petition with photographs and newspaper reports on the state of the Maidan after the rally, said he would challenge the affidavit. If the DYFI isnt to blame, where did the thousands of plates littering the Maidan come from? Why were the greens in such a mess? he asked.         
	Pradip Kumar Chattopadhyay, the joint commissioner of police who is standing in for the deputy commissioner (headquarters), said the makeshift chullahs mentioned in Duttas petition were dismantled as and when noticed.         
	The division bench of Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya and Justice R.N. Banerjee fixed Monday as the date for the next hearing, a day after a proposed Left Front rally at the same venue.         
	As many as 15 large utensils had been used to cook food for 130 busloads of people on the greens, barely a kilometre from Victoria Memorial. The DYFI tried to mend the damage later but signs of the excesses proved difficult to hide.

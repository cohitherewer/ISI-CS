The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fairway tripped by tree fall
                                                                                                               Fairway tripped by tree fall

	The Aila effect forced the citys premier golfing greens to suspend tee-off for the day. With trees tumbling on the sprawling fairway, the Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC) launched a salvage operation on Tuesday.        
	About 30-35 trees have been completely uprooted and about 70-80 trees have suffered extensive damage, said M.M. Singh, the clubs CEO.        
	Administrators of the Royal could not recall another instance of a storm-enforced shutdown in the past 70-80 years.        
	Efforts are on to reopen the practice range, putting and chipping green by Wednesday, the first nine holes on Thursday, and making the 18-hole course fully functional by the weekend.        
	The character of a hole changes whenever a tree falls between a hole and a green. From a golfers perspective it becomes much easier if the hazard  in the shape of the fallen tree  is removed. Just like it becomes easier for a batsman in cricket to score when a fielder is removed from a certain position, said Indrajit Bhalotia, the golfing coach in charge of the junior programme at both RCGC and Tollygunge Club.        
	As the storm hit the city on Monday, the weekly off-day at the club, there was no threat posed to golfers. The blast that came from the northeast corner of the course caused the maximum damage to the trees and the greens, explained CEO Singh.        
	Many rare trees were lost, CESC lines were snapped and water supply was hit. Two asbestos shades in the administrative offices of the club near the entry gate were blown off.        
	Royal being such a vintage course (the second oldest in the world), there are some landmarks. For instance, the 16th hole is named Mutt amp; Jeff after the trees that sit on the green next to it. If any such vintage tree was scalped by Aila, it would leave a sentimental void, said Bhalotia.        
	Across the road, the other 18-hole course seemed to have taken a lesser hit. We lost a lot of trees, roughly close to 60, but the greens were open this morning, said A.R Mukerji, the chief executive and managing member of Tollygunge Club. Our boys worked very hard and managed to clear the course of fallen trees. There are a few branches here and there that were not hacked but nothing that will obstruct the golfers, he added.

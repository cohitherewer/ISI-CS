The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Road-hog pandals
                                                                                                               Road-hog pandals
										      
	The high court call for fresh Puja guidelines comes at a time when the agencies responsible for drawing them up are either not enforcing the existing norms or issuing contradictory rules. Here are two pandals that illustrate the problems:        
	Vivekananda Sporting Association Durgotsab                        
	The 60-year-old puja is being organised by blocking one of the two entrances to the Institute of Blood Transfusion Medicine and Immune Haematology (Central blood bank), in a lane off Maniktala Main Road. The pandal, over 20ft wide, allows people to walk to the gate but prevents ambulances from approaching it. Thalassaemia patients regularly visit the premises for blood transfusion. We have obtained permissions from police, CMC, CESC and fire services, said Tuntun Chowdhury, a member of Vivekananda Sporting Association.          
	Kankulia Gariahat Palli Sarbojonin Durga Puja            
	The 22ft-wide pandal on 30ft-plus Kankulia Road, near Dhakuria, allows only a car to pass when it should have left at least 20ft free, according to the fire services norms. The organisers claim that they didnt leave more space free because of a guideline handed to them by Lake police station. It states that pandals should leave 10ft free for roads more than 30ft wide. The guideline was framed on the basis of a high court ruling in 2005, said a senior IPS officer. When asked if the ruling was applicable only in 2005, he replied: The high court later clarified that the order will continue for subsequent years till a fresh order is issued. High court lawyer J.N. Chatterjee, however, said: The ruling of 2005 was applicable only for that year. quot;         
	A member of the puja organising committee said: We have obtained permission from the fire services and are awaiting CESC clearance.

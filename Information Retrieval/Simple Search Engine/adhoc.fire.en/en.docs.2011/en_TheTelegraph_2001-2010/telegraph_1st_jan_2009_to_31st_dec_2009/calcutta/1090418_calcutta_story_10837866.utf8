The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Patient found dead off clinic
                                                                                                               Patient found dead off clinic
          SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE                              
	A 47-year-old trader, apparently suffering from depression and other ailments, was found dead a few metres from the Belghoria nursing home where he was admitted on Monday.        
	Police suspect Samir Dutta, who owned a shop for sanitary goods in Kasba, had jumped from the window of a second-floor toilet early on Friday.        
	A case of unnatural death has been registered and the body sent for post-mortem. It seems Samir died of head injury. The exact cause will be known after the post-mortem report comes, said an officer of Belghoria police station. Police are also probing the nursing homes role as the family has blamed the death on the managements negligence.        
	The window of a second-floor toilet, which overlooked the spot where the body was found, was open. We suspect he jumped from that window, said an officer.        
	Dutta, whose wife Archana is a state employee and son Tirtharaj studies in a private engineering college, had been suffering from diabetes and cardiac and breathing ailments. Family members told us he was also suffering from depression but did not specify the reason. Two months ago, the family had moved from Kasba to an apartment in Ariadaha, said an officer.        
	Dutta was admitted to the intensive care unit of the nursing home with respiratory and cardiac problems. He was shifted to the general bed on Thursday and was scheduled to be released on Friday, said the officer.        
	Local residents spotted Duttas body behind the nursing home compound around 7am and informed the police.        
	The clinic cannot shirk its responsibility. How can a patient jump off a window and the authorities claim to be in the dark about it? said a relative.

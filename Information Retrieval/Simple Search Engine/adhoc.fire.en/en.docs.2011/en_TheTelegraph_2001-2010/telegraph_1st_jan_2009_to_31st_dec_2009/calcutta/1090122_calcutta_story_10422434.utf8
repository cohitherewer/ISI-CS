The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Exam bar on teacher upheld
                                                                                                               Exam bar on teacher upheld
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court has upheld the school service commissions bar on a teacher becoming a headmistress because she did her B.Ed from Rabindra Bharati University when the course was not recognised.        
	Durba Sanyal (Bhattacharya), who teaches at the government-sponsored Sahanagar Girls High School in Behala, had taken permission from the education department and the commission before joining the B.Ed programme.        
	Justice Tapan Dutta, in his order on Wednesday, directed the university authorities to refund Durba the course fees. He also slapped a fine of Rs 5,000 on the university to compensate the hardship and mental agony that she had to face.        
	Durba had moved the court recently after the commission stopped her from taking a test to select high school heads because the National Council for Teachers Education (NCTE) had not recognised the B.Ed programme at Rabindra Bharati University when she completed the course in 1999.         
	According to the NCTE Act, the B.Ed courses conducted by any university or institute without approval of the NCTE are not valid, said advocate Kausik Chanda who represented the state.         
	The court accepted the argument and upheld the commissions decision.        
	The NCTE Act came into effect in 1997. The B.Ed course at the university was recognised in 2001.         
	At least 500 people obtained B.Ed degrees from Rabindra Bharati between 1997 and 2001.        
	Wednesdays order was stayed for four weeks following a request by Durba. She plans to move the division bench of the high court.

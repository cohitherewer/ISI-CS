	Most of our buyers are women but poker is one game that most men drop in to buy, points out a salesgirl at Starmark on Lord Sinha Road.        
	A game with colleagues and seniors can also help out-of-office bonding in these times of workplace worries. You get to know a lot professionally if youre playing with seniors from the workplace. Plus, you can be yourself  shout out loud or just indulge in some good-humoured cheating. All in all, its great fun, smiles event manager Chitvan Jaipuria.        
	The drawing room is not the only playing ground for board games. Scrabble and chess at all Barista outlets is a popular break between coffee and cookies. The board games are very popular. We get requests from the management to send new boards because the older ones are over-used and worn out, says Vishal Kapoor, the head of marketing and product development at Barista Coffee Company Ltd.

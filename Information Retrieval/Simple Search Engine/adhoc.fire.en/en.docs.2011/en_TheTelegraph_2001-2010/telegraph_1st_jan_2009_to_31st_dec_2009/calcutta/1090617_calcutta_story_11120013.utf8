The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Streaker shocker in school
                                                                                                               Streaker shocker in school
  - Young intruder strips in front of Class X girls and scoots          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Schoolgirls enjoying a break between classes got more than what they had bargained for when a young man barged in to do the Full Monty before sprinting out with his clothes tucked under his arms.        
	Mondays incident may have raised a few giggles among the Class X girls, but their guardians werent amused. Its a security breach. We have come here to protest, said an angry parent standing outside the north Calcutta school on Tuesday.        
	Students described the intruder, who had apparently scaled a high wall to enter the school, as a boy of around 20 dressed in a shirt and trousers.        
	As he stripped down to his birthday suit, the girls screamed  out of fear, the authorities asserted  drawing the attention of students in the other classes.        
	The rest also caught a glimpse of the streaker as he sprinted like Usain Bolt without his spandex and flashed through the rear exit.        
	He came, he stripped and he was gone before anyone could react. It left us all flabbergasted, one of the Class X girls recalled, still looking stunned.        
	A senior official of the school said guardians were blowing the issue out of proportion.         
	The intruder was probably a mad man. Our school has adequate security. Guardians need not worry about their wards safety, he assured.        
	The school authorities lodged a complaint with the police after the parents protest, but there was no breakthrough in the search for the mad man till late in the evening.        
	Streak of madness notwithstanding, Calcuttas first school streaker in recent history may have even been out to win a bet with friends, mused a police officer.

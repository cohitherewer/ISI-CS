The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Traffic signal puzzle for pedestrians
                                                                                                               Traffic signal puzzle for pedestrians
                                          
	Every traffic safety week, senior police officers blame pedestrians for causing accidents by not using the zebra crossing. While the average Calcuttan on foot often violates road rules, many crossings in the city also present a plethora of problems for them. Here are some intersections on APC Roy Road and AJC Bose Road that are unfriendly to pedestrians.              
	Moulali        
	Traffic confusion reigns supreme at Moulali and there is never a safe moment for the pedestrian to cross. The most dangerous zone is the zebra crossing near Creek Row, where people on foot have to dodge vehicles taking a right turn from CIT Road as well as those taking a left turn from Lenin Sarani.        
	Two constables and two civic cops were on duty when Metro visited the spot but none was helping pedestrians cross the 60ft-wide AJC Bose Road.        
	At the CIT Road end, a taped voice tried to persuade pedestrians to wait till the light turned green but there was no light for pedestrians in the first place.        
	This is a fine example of how unplanned traffic management is in Calcutta. Right before the road safety week, the cops suddenly set up a loudspeaker to make the announcement but forgot to install the lights, said Moloy Tarafdar, who passes the stretch on his way to office in Serpentine Lane.        
	We didnt notice that there wasnt a traffic light for pedestrians at the CIT Road-end. Now that we are aware of it, we will take prompt action, said assistant commissioner Sunil Mukherjee, whose jeep was parked at the intersection.         
	Jagat cinema        
	Even those manning traffic at the intersection, near Sealdah flyover on APC Road, are not sure about asking pedestrians to use the zebra crossing.        
	A civic cop told Metro the zebra crossing was obsolete and he always asked people to cross at another part of the road, nearer to the flyover.        
	A traffic sergeant who was in the area overruled him, saying the zebra crossing was functional and that to cross the road anywhere else would be jaywalking.        
	Bramha Girls        
	The footpaths here are too narrow. If students of Calcutta Deaf and Dumb School or Bramha Girls School want to use the pedestrian crossing near the former school, they have to walk on the main road as the footpath and one fourth of the carriageway is blocked by parked private buses of route number 204/1.        
	Rajabazar and Maniktala         
	The main problems at these intersections are vehicles moving beyond the stop line and blocking the zebra crossings and the traffic signal for pedestrians.        
	After the base of the tram tracks at Rajabazar was concreted over, pedestrians are forced to wait in the middle of the road while crossing from one flank to another. When trams come from both directions, there is about a foot and a half for the pedestrians to squeeze into.        
	Traffic lights for pedestrians have been installed at two of the four zebra crossings here.         
	At Maniktala, on the approach from Rajabazar, the traffic light for pedestrians never turns green.        
	I did not know that it was not working, said a constable manning the signal. Even if the traffic lights were working, they could not be seen as buses block the view.                
	Police version: Over 200,000 vehicles are booked for minor violations by the 14 traffic guards of Calcutta police, according to officers at Lalbazar. The fine, which is a flat Rs 100, is recovered in 60 to 70 per cent of cases, added the officer.

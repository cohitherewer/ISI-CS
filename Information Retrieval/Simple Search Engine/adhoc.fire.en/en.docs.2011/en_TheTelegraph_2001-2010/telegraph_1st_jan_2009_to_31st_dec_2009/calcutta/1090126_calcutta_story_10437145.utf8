The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Probe into noisy soiree
                                                                                                               Probe into noisy soiree
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Officials of the Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre in Salt Lake are losing sleep over a probe into a soiree that had left high court judges living next door sleepless through a November night.        
	The environment department is probing whether sound pollution norms were violated during a soiree at the centre, organised by employees of the income-tax department in mid-November.        
	A source at Bijan Bhawan, the official quarters of high court judges, said Justice Asim Banerjee had sent someone to the auditorium that night to ask the organisers to stop the programme but the plea was ignored. Loudspeakers were being used after 11pm in the open-air auditorium, disturbing the judges and everyone else in the vicinity. Using loudspeakers that blare sound over 60 decibels after 10pm is a punishable offence.        
	It isnt known how the judges had reacted when the high court-imposed cracker ban had gone bust on Diwali night, less than a month earlier.        
	A high court official said the caretaker of Bijan Bhawan had called police when the soiree continued but nobody came. It was only after a judge informed Shyamal Chakraborty, the registrar general of the high court, that the police moved.        
	Chakraborty contacted officials of the state pollution control board, who informed Bidhannagar (North) police station. By the time a team of policemen reached the auditorium, the programme had ended.        
	Judges residing in Bijan Bhawan and the high court authorities havent made any written representation but a probe is being conducted on the basis of a telephonic complaint by the registrar-general of the court, an official of the environment department said.        
	I have no idea whether sound norms were violated or not on that day, a representative of the centre said.        
	Income-tax officials claimed nobody from Bijan Bhawan had requested them to stop the programme. We voluntarily ended the event on realising that sound pollution norms were being violated.

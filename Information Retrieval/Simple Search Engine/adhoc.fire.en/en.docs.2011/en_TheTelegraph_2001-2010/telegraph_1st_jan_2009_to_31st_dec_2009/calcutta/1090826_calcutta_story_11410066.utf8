           Pointing fingers: Thank you for highlighting two typical performances of the city police on a single day (Red light for hero sergeant and Woman chases amp; collars teaser at Esplanade, May 11). In the first case, the unfortunate young officer is, possibly, a bad learner. He could not understand that honesty and uprightness are two sins in the service. So, he could not prove himself to be useful to his official and political bosses and the process of weeding out the odd one was initiated. The second incident is just short of a Bollywood script. The police officers lived up to their reputation of inaction by standing still while a woman was being teased in Esplanade. Later, they again played their part by resorting to delay tactics in recording the victims complaint. The policemans conversation with the culprit (Ki re, ki korechhis tui?) reminds one of Johnny Walker, an indispensable element for a box-office hit.                                             
	The decision of Calcutta University to distribute an academic calendar containing information on attendance, examination schedule and pass marks along with college admission forms for undergraduate courses from this year is welcome.           
	The calendar will serve as a guide to freshers and help them follow the norms of the institutions right from the commencement of the session till they take their final examinations.           
	Of late, it has almost become a practice for many students not to attend classes regularly. But when they are debarred from sitting in the final examinations for lack of attendance, or for failing to get the required pass marks in internal tests, they take recourse to agitation pleading ignorance of the relevant rules. This calendar will not allow truant students to make such pleas in future.           
	Some colleges allow 10 to 15 per cent grace attendance to avoid students unrest. But this practice needs to be stopped.           
	But only the distribution of the calendar will not be enough. A declaration in the prescribed form needs to be incorporated in the admission forms through which the students should vouch that they have gone through the calendar carefully and will follow the rules strictly. The declaration should be signed by the students and countersigned by their guardian or local guardian.           
	Dinabandhu Mukherjee,
  Behala                       
	Apropos Dumped patient dies unattended, May 19, it is sad that an abandoned patient was left to die at Medical College and Hospital after being deprived of treatment.             
	This incident underscores the deplorable condition of the states healthcare system. Patients are left unattended or bitten by rodents. Child deaths in government hospitals are quite common in West Bengal too.           
	Metro has time and again reported the pathetic and degrading health management of our state. But the authorities cannot be shaken out of their stupor.           
	The excuse offered by the hospital authorities for the death of the unattended patient is not convincing. Shortage of Group-D staffers can not be cited as a reason for a patients death. Had other hospital workers and doctors admitted the patient and arranged for treatment, he might have survived.           
	What is most pathetic is that these aged patients are abandoned by their families on hospital premises. This social malady is despicable. Elderly people need to be treated with care. However, the hospital authorities cannot shrug off their responsibility. No excuse can cover up the failure of the hospital staff in discharging their duties towards such patients. The health minister ought to look into the matter urgently.           
	Ratan Kumar Halder,
  Behala                   
	Odyssey, the largest bookstore in Calcutta downed shutters within 10 months of its opening, citing poor sales (Big bookstores beating retreat, May 19, 2009). Does Professor Amartya Sen still believe that Calcutta, the city I came from, has a huge book culture (Calcutta low crime linked to books: Sen, The Telegraph, April 21, 2009). Calcutta has no peculiar love of books and culture, contrary to Sens claim in his keynote opening address at the London Book Fair this year, The Calcutta Book Fair, the biggest in the world  bigger than even Frankfurt, notwithstanding. Odyssey proved that bitterly.             
	Tapan Pal,
  Batanagar             
	Apropos the report Cancer double blow for boys family, May 22, it is sad to learn that the parents of a 12-year-old Liluah boy have been suffering from cancer and the unfortunate boy has been forced to skip studies. Crores of rupees are being spent in the name of development, with very little progress in reality. The state health department should organise for free treatment of the ailing couple in a government hospital.             
	Prahlad Agarwala,
  Majdia, Nadia                   
	The report Katatel sold in the open, May 5, has not come as a surprise. Rackets like the sale of adulterated fuel or spurious liquor operate in the city openly as the law enforcement agencies conveniently look the other way. The authorities inaction is enough to prove their connivance. Unless the government punishes the guilty and sacks the officials involved in the nexus, such rackets would continue to flourish in Calcutta and its suburbs.             
	A.S. Mehta,
  New Alipore                       
	The three little bravehearts  Zubin Sheth, Mohit Mehta and Swati Bhura  have shown exemplary courage and will power in successfully fighting against the odds in life (Little bravehearts armed with books and a never-say-die spirit, May 25). Their determination and positive approach towards life should be inspirational to those who are unable to overcome hardships. Their story should also be an eye-opener to those who, in spite of being blessed with all comforts, have failed to make it in life because of a lack of commitment.             
	Jaya Ghosh, 
  Sarat Banerjee Road           
	Hats off to the three youngsters for their resilience. Their achievements in the secondary and higher secondary exams in spite of the difficulties in their lives are inspiring. Mohit Mehta hails from St Josephs College in Bowbazar, from where I passed my ISC too. God bless them all.           
	Kaushik Dasgupta, 
  Address not mentioned                   
	Apropos the report Theres a will, theres a vote, May 14, I salute the spirit of Dilip Kumar Chakraborty and Jamshed Sheikh. Despite being hospitalised and bedridden, they exercised their constitutional right and voted in the Lok Sabha elections.             
	The undying spirit and the importance of elections in the eyes of these two men should serve as an example for those who do not turn up at polling booths or do not attach any importance to franchise.           
	Atif Ayaz, 
  Serampore                   
	Apropos Former help arrested for drug and rob, May 25, police have asked people to verify the credentials of their help and submit their details to the neighbouring police station. Provisions have been made for downloading a form from their website for filling up details on domestic helps. But the forms cant be submitted online; one has to go to a police station for that. But unless police stations are made people-friendly, people will try to avoid the visit and fail to submit the forms.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cess for commercial vehicles
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Cess for commercial vehicles
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The state government intends collecting cess on the motor vehicles tax of commercial vehicles in an attempt to provide social security cover for all employees in the sector.        
	Billed as the first of its kind for transport workers, the proposed cess may come into effect from the next fiscal if the Assembly okays the West Bengal Transport Workers Welfare Bill in the winter session, set to begin on November 30.        
	The bill seeks to levy the cess on all vehicles run commercially. This includes private buses, minibuses, trucks, Matadors, taxis and autorickshaws, labour minister Anadi Sahoo told Metro over phone from Kerala on Wednesday evening.        
	The rate of the proposed cess hasnt been decided yet but will be less than 10 per cent of the motor vehicles tax, finance minister Asim Dasgupta said after a Cabinet meeting that cleared the proposal.        
	The annual motor vehicles tax for a bus is around Rs 10,000. For taxis and autos, the figures are around Rs 2,000 and Rs 1,800, respectively.        
	Officials said the proceeds from the cess would be spent on welfare schemes for lakhs of people working in the commercial transport sector.        
	The list of benefits will include provident fund, medical and education allowance, and financial help for those injured in mishaps as well as the families of accident victims.        
	Sahu said employees of private non-commercial vehicles would not come within the purview of the benefits. But we may consider their case after the bill is tabled in the winter session of the Assembly, the minister added.        
	Finance minister Dasgupta said: Our late transport minister Subhas Chakraborty had conceived the idea and we will implement it.        
	With the cess rate yet to be finalised, officials in the finance department refused to hazard a guess on the mop-up.        
	The governments announcement had initially created confusion on the ambit of the cess prompting transport minister Ranjit Kundu to step in and clear the air.        
	The scheme is only for commercial vehicles. We dont have plans to levy the cess on non-commercial ones, Kundu clarified.        
	The transport lobby has criticised the government move. There are several cess already in place, including a few that have outlived their usefulness. Why cant the government reassign one such cess for this purpose? wondered Swarnakamal Saha, a Trinamul Congress MLA and a key leader of the transport operators lobby.

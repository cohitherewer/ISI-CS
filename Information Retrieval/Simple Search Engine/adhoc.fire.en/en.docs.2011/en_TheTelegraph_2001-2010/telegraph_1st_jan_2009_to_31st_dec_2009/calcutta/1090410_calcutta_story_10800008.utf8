The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Grumbles amp; gasps at shop stops   Rent row at shop stops 
                                                                                                               Grumbles amp; gasps at shop stops     - Retailers struggle to foot mall bill as footfalls drop and sales dip           POULOMI BANERJEE                          LIGHT AND SHADE: A store in South City without electricity on Thursday. (Rashbehari Das)                                        
	The rent row between shop retailers and the mall management saw the lights go out at one address and the battle lines hardening in another on Thursday as shop stops suffered from the browsers-few-and-buyers fewer blues.        
	Leather brand Hidesign at South City mall was in darkness from Wednesday afternoon with the mall authorities allegedly pulling the plug over rent dues. The lights also went out briefly at a jeans shop in the Prince Anwar Shah Road mall.        
	There have been no sales today. Shoppers are thinking that the store is closed, shrugged the Hidesign store employee at South City mall. The jeans brand blamed the power cut on a miscommunication as all payments had been made. Sanjeev Mehra, head of operations at South City, denied disconnection for dues. There is no problem of payment, he stressed.        
	But the grumbles and gasps among brands struggling to foot the mall bill are growing with the drop in footfall and dip in sales. At Forum, shop rent is hiked by 15 per cent every three years, but this time several retailers, including Hidesign, are reluctant to accept the additional burden.        
	In Delhi and Mumbai, mall owners are bringing down the rent for this period. Only in Calcutta are we having this problem. In Calcutta our business has been hit very hard, probably because the customer base is very stock market oriented. Business has dropped by 30 per cent here, said Dilip Kapur of Hidesign.                                                                                
	A premium watch brand store in Forum echoed Kapur. We have 16 store across India and the problem is only in Calcutta. With Forum increasing the rent, we have been forced to shut down our second store at the mall. The rent is comfortable only in City Centre, said an official.        
	The mall management, however, denied the rent row. The hike in rent came into effect from March and every store has paid the revised price. We have thanked all the stores for that, said Ujjal of Forum.        
	Because of the general slowdown everywhere, our footfall and sales have down gone by 5 to 7 per cent. But none of the retailers are bleeding. Our full concentration now is on getting more people to the mall and encouraging sales, added Ujjal.        
	That is something Mani Square has managed to do this month. The mall on the Bypass that was struggling with footfall and conversions has dangled the more-fun-at-low-cost carrot for the Calcutta consumer to come flocking.        
	The two-week Baishakhi Blast at the mall, from April 1 to Poila Baisakh, offering food, films and fun for Rs 21 has managed to draw in the crowds like never before.        
	According to mall sources, the first week of April has achieved a 300 per cent rise in overall footfall over the corresponding period in March, all thanks to the price point.        
	Footfalls have tripled and our weekend sales have gone up by 50 per cent and weekdays by 30-40 per cent, said Shiv Daswani of Little Shop.        
	When the overall mood is down, one needs to give the consumer far greater value for money in order to fuel spending and that is what the Mani Square scheme has managed to achieve, stresses a retailer with outlets in three of the four malls in town.

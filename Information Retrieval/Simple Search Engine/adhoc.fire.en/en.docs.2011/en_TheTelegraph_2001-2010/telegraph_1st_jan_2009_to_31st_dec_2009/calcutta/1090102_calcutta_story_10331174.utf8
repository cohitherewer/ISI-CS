The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Subhass 14000 bluff
                                                                                                               Subhass 14000 bluff
          OUR BUREAU                          Application forms for the replacement of two-stroke autorickshaws being distributed at an auto stand near Ruby hospital on Thursday. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                  
	Subhas Chakraborty has done it again. Dodged a deadline and booed a ban. Probably for the 14,000th time.        
	The transport minister on Wednesday had announced virtual immunity for 14,000 two-stroke autos that had apparently applied for conversion to four-stroke, promising that they would not be touched by police.        
	This emboldened the rogue vehicles to flout the deadline on Thursday but it could land the government in a legal jam.        
	He (Chakraborty) cannot say this. He could have approached the court, presented the practical problems for the phase-out by December 31, and pleaded for more time. What he has said is not right, said Subrata Mukhopadhyay, a junior standing counsel for the state government.        
	If legal eagles were left wagging a finger at Chakraborty, the green lobby was in a flap over the 14,000 figure he had flaunted with seven hours to go for the ban on two-stroke autos from city streets.        
	The facts of the conversion case do not support the ministers mystery figure. The transport department had published a notification in newspapers specifying August 29, 2008, as the deadline for applying for replacement of two-stroke autos.         
	The deadline was later extended till November 28. According to transport department sources, around 600 applications were submitted within the stipulated period.        
	This figure of 14,000 is a mystery. If around 600 applications were submitted till November 28, how can the minister come up with this count of 14,000? demanded emission expert S.M. Ghosh.        
	Without proper notification, the extension of deadline for accepting such applications is illegal and a violation of the order.        
	The ground reality, however, is that application forms are being rushed from the public vehicles department (PVD) shelves to auto stands across the city as three-wheeler unions make a beeline for the escape route  with no legal sanction  offered by the minister.        
	The environment department refused to buy the 14,000 argument of the transport minister.         
	According to the high court order, no two-stroke auto is supposed to ply from January 1, said M.L. Meena, the environment secretary.        
	Subhash Dutta, the petitioner in the auto pollution case, promised to call the ministers bluff. What he has said has no legal basis and what the administration has done on the first day of the ban amounts to contempt of court. I will bring this to the attention of the court, said Dutta.

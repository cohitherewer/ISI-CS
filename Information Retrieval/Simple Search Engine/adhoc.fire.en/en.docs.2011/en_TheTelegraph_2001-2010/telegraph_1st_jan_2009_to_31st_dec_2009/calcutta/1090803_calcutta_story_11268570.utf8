The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CMC scheme with eye on poll
                                                                                                               CMC scheme with eye on poll
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                              
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has drawn up a development scheme to woo minorities, who are believed to have turned away from the Left Front leading to its rout in a series of recent elections.        
	The Centre will grant Rs 25 crore for the scheme, which has been modelled on the Centres 15-point programme for the welfare of minorities, said joint municipal commissioner Sahidul Islam.        
	The contributions of the civic body and the state government are yet to be finalised.        
	The document containing details of the package  titled Multi-sectoral Conceptual Plan for the Development of Minorities in the CMC Area  state the citys minority communities have remained deprived.        
	To address the grievances, the CMC has decided to set up 25 Urdu-medium schools, of which five will be for girls. Ten of the new schools will be mobile. The city now has 50 Urdu-medium schools, all of which will be renovated.        
	To boost the employment prospects of the minorities, the CMC has decided to introduce vocational courses for 2,000 youths. Ten vocational training centres and four hostels for working men and women will be set up. Women, especially those from financially weak families, will be encouraged to join the vocational courses.        
	The CMC will also focus on developing physical infrastructure in minority-dominated areas. As part of the scheme, 3,000 low-cost houses and 20 night shelters will be built.        
	The minority pockets will have 150 community toilets and 15 ward health units. The civic authorities have also decided to deploy five ambulances for the minorities.        
	Sources said the schemes had been drawn up keeping in mind the CMC polls in 2010 and the Assembly elections the year after. The CPM state leadership is of the opinion that the erosion in the partys support base among minorities is a key reason for its poor show in the panchayat, Lok Sabha and municipal polls. The schemes, if properly implemented, will hopefully turn the tide, said a source.

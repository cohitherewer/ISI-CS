The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Knights ride Bong beam   A different ball game, in Bengali
                                                                                                               Knights ride Bong beam     - Mother tongue to describe Souravs strokes on TV          RITH BASU                        BONG HERO: Sourav Ganguly at Eden Gardens. (Santosh Ghosh)				                                       
	Ooof, cover onchol diye Maharaj-er maati kamre duronto shot!        
	Dont fall off your chair if you hear this on TV during the Kolkata Knight Riders vs Deccan Chargers match at Cape Town on Sunday. All it means is that Sourav Ganguly has just driven a ball through the covers.        
	Bengali commentary of the KKR matches in the Indian Premier League (IPL-2) is set to spice up masala cricket on the small screen this month, with Sony Entertainment Television giving a regional touch to the slam-bang proceedings in South Africa.        
	For the Bong connection, T20 fans will have to tune into Channel Eight Talkies, while SET Max will air the English-Hindi commentary combo.        
	The KKR was singled out for the regional commentary because of the sheer popularity of the team and also because Calcutta is Calcutta when it comes to following sports, said Ashok Surana, the channel head of Channel Eight Talkies. Just think how Eden Gardens filled up each time during the KKRs home games in the first edition (of the IPL); that is the market we are catering to.        
	This comes a day after owner Shah Rukh Khan crowed at Cape Town that the KKR was the coolest looking team and two days after Priyanka Gandhi Vadra confirmed that she would be cheering for the Knights.        
	Bengali commentary for cricket lovers hooked to the radio would mean the over-the-top monologue of ex-Bengal skippers Kamal Bhattacharya and Premangshu Chatterjee, Ajay Bose and Pushpen Sarkar.                                           
	 ldquo;Cricket commentary in Bengali on TV! It will be a first of its kind and I would definitely tune in provided the commentary is good. Overall, it rsquo;s good news for Bengalis but the presentation has to be in sync with the spirit of IPL, which is all about entertainment rdquo;  
	JISSHU SENGUPTA, ACTOR    
	Given the mad pace of T20 games, you probably wont hear famous expressions like Alto kore duti fielder er majhkahane ball thele diye jayga bodol kore nilen batsman ra (Nudging the ball between two fielders, the batsmen cross ends), smiles septuagenarian Pramod Ranjan Chowdhury, who would be hooked to radio commentary before the advent of television.        
	Keeping alive the tradition of former Bengal captains doing cricket commentary, Raju Mukherjee has been signed on by Channel Eight Talkies  which has been recently acquired by Sony  while talks are on with ex-Bengal spinner Saradindu Mukherjee.        
	During the on-going I-League, matches of the Maidans big three were telecast on Zee Sports with Hindi and English commentary and simultaneously on 24 Ghanta with Bengali commentary. Many many people in this part of the world chose to tune in to the Bengali commentary. It should be the same for KKR matches, said Raju Mukherjee, who will follow the Ritchie Benaud school of commentary.         
	The trick in TV commentary (as opposed to radio) is to speak less about the on-field action as the viewer can see it for himself. There is thus scope to explain laws of the game and delve into a bit into history.        
	The Bengali beam is set to extend to the two semi-finals and the final even if KKR falls short.

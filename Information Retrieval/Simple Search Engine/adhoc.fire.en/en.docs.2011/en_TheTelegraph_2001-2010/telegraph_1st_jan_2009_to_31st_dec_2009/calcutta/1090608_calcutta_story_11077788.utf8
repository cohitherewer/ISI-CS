The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hyderabad base of dud firm
                                                                                                               Hyderabad base of dud firm
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Assurgent Technology Solutions, which shut down its Sector V unit last week without clearing the dues of over 1,800 trainees and employees, has its headquarters in Hyderabad and is registered with Nasscom and the Software Technology Parks of India (STPI).        
	Nasscom is a global trade body and the chamber of commerce of the IT-BPO industries in India. The STPI is a society set up by the Centres IT and communications department to boost software export.        
	Infogen Global was not registered with the STPI so we could easily tag it a dud firm. But Assurgent is registered with the STPI as well as Nasscom, said Debesh Das, the state IT minister on Sunday.        
	I believe the company shut its business after incurring huge losses and duped its 1,800-odd trainees and employees of their salaries and Rs 1 lakh security deposit. I have asked police to conduct a thorough inquiry, the minister added.        
	The company had been operating in Sector V for two years without a trade licence, said S.A. Ahmed, the chairman of Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority, the administrative body of the tech hub.        
	The police said the offices of the company at Hyderabad, Bhubaneswar and Durgapur were shut and four officials have been arrested.

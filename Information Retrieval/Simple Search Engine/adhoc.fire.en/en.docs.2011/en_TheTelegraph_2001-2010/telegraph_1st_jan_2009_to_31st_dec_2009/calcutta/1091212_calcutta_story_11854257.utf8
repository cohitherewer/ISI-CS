The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Xaviers brief for CM
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Xaviers brief for CM
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The principal of the citys first autonomous college briefed Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on the benefits of autonomy on Friday amidst the growing controversy over the contents of the draft bill to confer unitary university status on Presidency College.        
	Father Felix Raj, the principal of St Xaviers College, claimed that his meeting with the chief minister on Friday afternoon was a courtesy call. But sources at Writers Buildings said the meeting took place because Bhattacharjee wanted first-hand feedback on the impact of autonomy on the Park Street college that was conferred the status in 2006.        
	We discussed several things during the meeting. Since we have completed the first phase of autonomy, I also shared the colleges experience with the chief minister. I briefed him on the positive outcomes of autonomy for our college, Felix Raj told Metro.         
	The state government had given autonomy to St Xaviers for six years, of which it has completed three.        
	Felix Raj said he told the chief minister that academic standards had improved since St Xaviers was given the freedom to frame its own syllabus. He also highlighted the other positive aspects of autonomy like tying up with foreign universities and the introduction of a credit system for student assessment, all of which he had shared with members of a chamber recently.         
	Autonomy has made the college education system much more student-friendly, Felix Raj had said at the chamber of commerce.        
	It is no secret that Bhattacharjee dreams of similar freedom for his alma mater, but the Presidency University Bill, 2009  drafted by the legal and higher education departments  contains several provisions that come in the way of full academic and administrative freedom for the 192-year-old institution.         
	The chief minister can share these details (about the Xaviers experience) with some of his party colleagues and can get the bill amended once it comes up for discussion on the floor of the Assembly, said a Presidency alumnus.        
	A senior official in the chief ministers secretariat said Fridays meeting with Felix Raj would not have any bearing on the decision to confer unitary university status on Presidency.         
	The principal invited the chief minister to be present at the 150-year celebrations of St Xaviers. He also sought his help for a plot of land (other than the six acres off the EM Bypass) for the proposed new campus, said the official.

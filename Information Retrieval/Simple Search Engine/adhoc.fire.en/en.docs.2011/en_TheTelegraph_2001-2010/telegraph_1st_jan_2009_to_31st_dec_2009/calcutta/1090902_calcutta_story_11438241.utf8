The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cops in lady mishap hush-up
                                                                                                               Cops in lady mishap hush-up
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Calcutta police tried hushing up an accident involving one of its vans by promising to bear the medical expenses of the victim if her family did not lodge a complaint.        
	The accident, which occurred on Free School Street on Sunday night, remained just another entry in the motor collision register of a police station  and the wrong one at that  until a family member of the victim contacted Metro on Tuesday to complain about the cops going back on their word.        
	Jitesh Golani, a nephew of injured homemaker Payal Golani, said on Monday that the police were now refusing to pay the medical bill exceeding Rs 1 lakh, including the cost of surgery on the 44-year-old victims left leg.        
	 An officer at Park Street police station told me that there was no question of paying or sharing the bill. He said the police could at best ask the private nursing home to offer a reasonable discount, the New Market trader said.        
	But Jiteshs version changed on Tuesday after the police apparently reprimanded him for letting the cat out of the bag. We have reached an understanding with the police. Please dont botherits settled, he told Metro.        
	The officer-in-charge of Park Street police station, Kafeel Ahmed Hashmi, however claimed that Payals family wasnt promised anything.         
	We took her to Chittaranjan Hospital after the accident because that was our duty. When her family insisted that she be shifted to a private nursing home, we did that as well. But they cant expect us to pay for the entire treatment, Hashmi said.        
	What about following the rules and initiating proceedings against the police van driver guilty of rash driving?        
	We are looking into it, the officer-in-charge said.        
	Anyone guilty of rash and negligent driving leading to death or grievous injuries is to be booked under sections 279 and 338 of the IPC, which warrant arrest. Both sections are bailable, though.        
	Till late on Tuesday, the police had not even given out the name of the cop who was driving the van that hit Payal from behind near the fire station on Free School Street around 10.30pm on Sunday.        
	Another question that remained unanswered was why a report was filed at Park Street police station, to which the van belongs, and not New Market police station, under whose jurisdiction the accident occurred.        
	Jitesh, who was accompanying Payal when the accident occurred, said the police van was racing and that his aunt was lucky to survive.        
	The police personnel in the van asked us not to panic, saying they would arrange for medical treatment, he recalled.        
	Payal was first taken to Chittaranjan Hospital, from where she was shifted to Royd Nursing Home.        
	An official of the nursing home, where Payal is recuperating from surgery in cabin number 302, said she had suffered compound fractures of the left foot, dislocation of joints and concussion.        
	A senior officer of the polices south division admitted that rash driving could have caused the accident but denied that the team from Park Street police station promised to bear the victims medical expenses.        
	Her family members had requested us to ask the nursing home authorities to offer a discount, which we did, he said.

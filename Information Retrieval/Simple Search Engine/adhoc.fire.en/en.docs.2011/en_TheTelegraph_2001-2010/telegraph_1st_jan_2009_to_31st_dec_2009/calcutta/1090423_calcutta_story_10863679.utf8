                                                                                                               Whats on your mind this week
                            
	The entry to Ballygunge Science College, on Ballygunge Circular Road, is strewn with white bird droppings. But if one ignores the nauseating smell and looks up, one finds perched high on a tree a colony of Black-Crowned Night Herons. A night forager, it rests by day. A tree, full of the large grey-and-white-coloured birds can be an arresting sight. It has a characteristic black crest and a pair of white plumes that extend from the back of the head.         
	Due to their wide distribution and feeding habits, they are an excellent indicator of the health of the ecosystem.         
	They are a sight for sore eyes, and a reminder of Indias biodiversity.

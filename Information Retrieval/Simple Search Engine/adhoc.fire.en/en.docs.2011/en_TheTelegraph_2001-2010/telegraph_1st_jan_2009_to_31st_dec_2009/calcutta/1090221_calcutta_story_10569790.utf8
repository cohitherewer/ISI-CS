                      Wares from a distant land                    Folk art and tribal art in our country take on different manifestations through varied medium such as pottery, painting, metalwork, paper-art, weaving and designing of objects like jewellery and toys. Often puranic gods and legends are transformed into contemporary forms and familiar images. Fairs, festivals and local deities play a vital role in these arts where life and creativity are inseparable. The tribal arts have a unique sensitivity. The artists minds are supple and intense with myth, legends, snippets from epic, multitudinous gods born out of dream and fantasy. Their art is an expression of their life and holds their passion and mystery. Folk art also includes the visual expressions of the wandering nomads, who carry with them the experiences and memories of different spaces, and their art consists of the transient and dynamic pattern of life. The rural, tribal and arts of the nomads constitute the matrix of folk expression. Crafts Council of West Bengal hosts Tribal Treasures, a display and demonstration of tribal craft. Items on display include Todas from Nilgiris, Rogan painters of Kutch, Mech weavers from Jalpaiguri, jewellery from Dhenkanal, Dokra from Mayurbhanj, Santhali kantha and organic jewellery from Santiniketan.

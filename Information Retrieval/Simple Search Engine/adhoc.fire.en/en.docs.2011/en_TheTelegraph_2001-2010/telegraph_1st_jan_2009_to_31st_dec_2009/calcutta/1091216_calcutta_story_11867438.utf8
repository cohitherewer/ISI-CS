The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Presidency bill in House
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Presidency bill in House
          OUR BUREAU                              
	The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government tabled the Presidency University Bill 2009 in the Assembly on Tuesday and set the ball rolling to grant unitary university status to the college.        
	The 36-page bill, following Assembly norms, was later referred to the standing committee attached to the higher education department.        
	Higher education minister Sudarshan Ray Chaudhuri said the government was committed to turning the 192-year-old institution into a world-class university.        
	But promises alone cannot stem the rot on the College Street campus and transform it into a centre of excellence, said an alumnus of the college who has long been rooting for its autonomy.        
	The clauses in the bill do not spell out how the institution will attract the best teachers, he pointed out.        
	Ray Chaudhuri, however, clarified that Presidency University would be given the freedom to select teachers from the outset.        
	The current teachers, he said, will be allowed to apply for faculty positions once the university starts functioning.        
	Anyone who meets the eligibility criteria can apply. A screening committee will select the teachers. All candidates, including the current teachers, will have to face the screening panel, the minister said.        
	The existing teachers who will fail to make the cut will retain their jobs in the new university till they are transferred to other government colleges.        
	Some Calcutta University veterans are not happy with the proposed teacher selection process, saying a lack of clarity in the bill would result in political interference.        
	If the bill is passed in its present form, the screening committee will be packed with people close to the CPM. And if the teacher selection process becomes biased, the purpose of conferring unitary university status on the college will be defeated, said a retired CU professor.        
	Autonomy backers are banking on the 10-member standing committee which can incorporate changes into the bill. Amendments can also be made when the bill will be debated on the floor of the House.        
	But if the CPM is determined to pass the bill as it is, it will be difficult to incorporate any change, said Deba Prasad Sarkar, an SUCI legislator.        
	The government, he added, should have sent the bill to the select committee concerned.        
	One can put a note of dissent in a select committee, which is not possible in standing committee deliberations that do not record contrary views, said Sarkar.        
	Ray Chaudhuri said the bill would be placed for discussion in the next session of the Assembly, scheduled for February-March 2010.        
	Apart from the alleged lack of clarity on recruitment of teachers, the autonomy backers are unhappy with the bill for other reasons as well.        
	The provisions in the bill related to the inclusion of elected members in the policy-making bodies are same as the ones in the acts governing Calcutta, Jadavpur and other state universities, said a Presidency alumnus.        
	Unless these provisions are amended no one can prevent the interference of the ruling party in the daily functioning of the university, the alumnus added.

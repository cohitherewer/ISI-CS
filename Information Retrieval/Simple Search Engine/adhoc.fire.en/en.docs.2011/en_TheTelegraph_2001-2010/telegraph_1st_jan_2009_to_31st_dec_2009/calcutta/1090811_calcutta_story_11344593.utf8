The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Swine flu classes in schools
                                                                                                               Swine flu classes in schools

	City schools are organising an awareness campaign on swine flu for students and their parents but taking care not to trigger panic.        
	We dont want students to panic but they must know about the disease in detail. We need to take all precautions, said Anuradha Das, the principal of Calcutta International School.         
	Every day, the school brings doctors who talk about the disease and its symptoms, how to prevent infection and where to go for tests.         
	Modern High School for Girls, too, has launched an awareness drive among the students. We have cancelled a students trip to Maharashtra after learning that some schools there have been asked to close down temporarily because of the flu threat, said principal Devi Kar.         
	Krishna Damani of South Point High School said: We are formulating a guideline for our students on how to protect themselves from the H1N1 virus and what to do if they contract the disease.         
	St James principal Terence Ireland said the authorities would issue a notice asking parents not to send their wards to school if they are found to be suffering from swine flu symptoms.         
	Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School is keeping an eye out on anyone feeling unwell. We dont want our students to panic but it is necessary to make them aware about the disease, said principal Malini Bhagat.         
	Suspects: Two Koreans  Ji Sung Sang, 35, and Tung Wah Jiya, 21,  who were admitted to Beleghata ID Hospital on Monday tested negative for swine flu.

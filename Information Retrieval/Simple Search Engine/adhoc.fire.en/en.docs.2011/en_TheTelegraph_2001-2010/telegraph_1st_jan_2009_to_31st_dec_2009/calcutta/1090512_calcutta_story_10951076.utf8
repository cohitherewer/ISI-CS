The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Girl fights BSF molester
                                                                                                               Girl fights BSF molester
          A STAFF REPORTER                                          
	A young woman hauled a BSF jawan to the police station on Monday evening after he allegedly molested her near New Market.        
	Helped by witnesses on Lindsay Street, the woman in her mid-20s confronted the accused and three of his colleagues who are in town for poll duty.        
	The accused was taken to New Market police station around 5.30pm, but he was not arrested and allowed to leave around 9pm.        
	Sources said the jawans had called their superiors who rushed to the police station, apologised for the conduct of their colleague and requested the woman to withdraw her complaint.         
	The accused, too, offered an apology but the woman refused to withdraw her complaint. The BSF team, including the accused, left the police station around 9pm, said a source.        
	Officer-in-charge Samit Gupta refused to explain why the accused was not arrested even after the complainant had identified him. We are taking all necessary steps, was all he would say.        
	The woman, as stated in the complaint, had come to shop in New Market around 5pm. The jawans were in their duty jeep parked along the southern pavement of Lindsay Street, facing Jawaharlal Nehru Road.        
	When the woman was walking past the jeep, one of the jawans suddenly opened the door and molested her.        
	As she raised an alarm, the jawans tried to speed off but their vehicle was blocked by witnesses and bystanders. They must have been drinking in the jeep as half-empty beer bottles were found inside, said a witness.        
	The jawans were then forced to accompany the woman and the crowd to the police station.        
	The additional deputy inspector-general of BSF (South Bengal Frontier), Vikas Chandra, told Metro over the phone from Delhi: I have heard about the complaint. If any of our jawans is found guilty, action will be taken against him.        
	A source in the BSF said the team was to be deployed in Behala on election day.        
	On Sunday afternoon, a 30-year-old woman had fought back after being teased in Esplanade. Shreyasee Bhaduri chased the man down a pavement, grabbed him by the collar and dragged him to Hare Street police station. Unlike the BSF jawan on Monday, her tormentor was arrested.

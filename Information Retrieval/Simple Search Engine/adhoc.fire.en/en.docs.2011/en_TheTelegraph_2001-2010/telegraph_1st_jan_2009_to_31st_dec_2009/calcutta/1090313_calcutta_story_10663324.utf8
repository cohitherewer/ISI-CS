                      Austria-India harmony                    One of the leading Japanese musicians of his generation, Joji Hattori has enjoyed a varied career as a musician; first, as a concert violinist, an activity which has developed into directing chamber orchestras, conducting symphony orchestras and, finally, operas. Since 2004, he has been the associate conductor of Vienna Chamber Orchestra. Born in Japan, he spent his childhood in Vienna, where his music career took shape from regularly attending the opera house and concert halls. Influenced by both cultures, Hattori is today one of the very few conductors of Asian heritage who is respected internationally for his interpretation of Viennese classics. As part of the celebration of 60 years of Austria-India diplomatic relations, Joji Hattori will conduct the Vienna Chamber Orchestra in a Western classical music concert. One of the leading cultural ambassadors of Austria, this 17-member orchestra has also been under the leadership of music icons, Yehudi Menuhin and Alfred Brendall. The pieces to be performed this evening include Johann Strauss The Bat - Overture, Joseph Haydns Serenade from String Quartet op. 3 no. 5, Franz Schuberts Symphony No. 3 D major D 200 and Ludwig van Beethovens Romance No. 2 for Violin and Orchestra F major op. 50 and Symphonie Nr. 1 C-Dur op. 21 (1799-1800).

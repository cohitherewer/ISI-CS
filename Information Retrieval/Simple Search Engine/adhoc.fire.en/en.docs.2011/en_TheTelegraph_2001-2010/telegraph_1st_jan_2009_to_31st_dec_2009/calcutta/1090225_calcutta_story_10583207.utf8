                      The soul of Mohinyattam                    Capturing the spirit of one art form through another is in itself an aesthetic adventure. It is all the more challenging to recreate the charm and grace of a classical art form in a medium like film. A documentary on Mohinyattam, Adoor Gopalakrishnans The Dance of the Enchantress takes up this challenge in great style. A tribute to this classical dance form of Kerala, it brings into focus the essential character of the art form through the films own meditative and unhurried compositions. Marked by brilliant expositions by various performers, the film creates a special ambience and demands a reflective mindset from viewers to enable them to ease into the very soul of the art. In the process, the film documents some of the most impressive performances by reowned and upcoming artistes of our time. Featuring dance performances by Kalamandalam Satyabhama, Sreedevi Rajan, Kalamandalam Kshemavathy, Kalamandalam Leelamma, Smitha Rajan and Neena Prasad and accompanied by singers like Kalamandalam Jayaprakash, Kalamandalam Jagadeesh and Madhavan Namboothiri, it also portrays the famous palaces, houses and training grounds like Thiruvattar Temple, Padmanabhapuram Palace, Kuthiramalika, Bhajanapuram Kottaram and Kalamandalam, that have nurtured this art.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Bandobast for bandh control
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Over 2,000 policemen will patrol the streets on Tuesday as SUCI observes a 12-hour Bengal bandh to protest price rise. Senior cops have been asked to man the streets to ensure there is no forcible closure of shops and destruction of state property, including the new low-floor buses.         
	There will be extra vigil at bus and tram depots and 21 major markets, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters).         
	Transport minister Ranjit Kundu said he had asked all transport corporations to ensure adequate buses plied on Tuesday and appealed to private operators not to stay off the roads fearing violence. The new buses are social property and I hope the activists would spare them, he said.         
	Cops said Tuesdays bandh would not be disruptive except in a few pockets in South 24-Parganas, where the SUCI has some clout. But some city schools like Mahadevi Birla and Loreto Day School, Sealdah, have declared a holiday.         
	La Martiniere for Girls, Calcutta Boys, Calcutta Girls, Delhi Public School (Ruby Park), Birla High School for Boys and Apeejay Schools (Park Street and Salt Lake) have asked parents to take a call depending on the situation on Tuesday morning. Patha Bhavan suspended classes for V to VII standards and asked parents to take a call for senior students.         
	Loreto Day School on Lenin Sarani will be open and scheduled exams held. The Birla High schools (boys and girls) will hold the pre-boards exams for classes X and XII. The Apeejay schools have postponed the second-term exams. BD Memorial has suspended classes, but the school wont be closed.

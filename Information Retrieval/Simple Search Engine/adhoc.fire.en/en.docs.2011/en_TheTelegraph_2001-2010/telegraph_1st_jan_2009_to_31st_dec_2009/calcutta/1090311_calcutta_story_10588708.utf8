The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Civic body stops outdoor fogging
                                                                                                               Civic body stops outdoor fogging

	The civic authorities have discontinued the 40-year-old practice of outdoor fogging to ward off mosquitoes to the relief of thousands of Calcuttans who choke on the cocktail of pesticide and diesel.        
	We have decided to stop outdoor fogging from this year on the basis of suggestions by a nine-member advisory committee, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.        
	However, if mosquito-borne diseases break out in the city, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) may carry out fogging inside houses.        
	The smoke emitted during fogging is a gaseous mix of pesticide and diesel. Moreover, a fogging machine consumes 100 litres of diesel per hour, said chief municipal health officer DebDwaipayan Chattopadhyay.        
	Councillors are not happy with the decision to scrap outdoor fogging. Fogging kills adult mosquitoes and above all, appeases people, said Trinamul Congress councillor Firhad Hakim.        
	If the mosquito population grows rapidly, outdoor fogging can offer temporary relief to people in a locality, said CPM councillor Jayasree Debnandy.         
	The Directorate of National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme has warned the CMC that malaria, dengue, Japanese encephalitis and Kala azar cases might increase this year because of erratic weather conditions.         
	Malaria is most common in the city between July-August and November. The incidence of mosquito-borne diseases increases if there is intermittent rain, said Chattopadhyay. Drawing lessons from the outbreak of dengue and malaria last year, the civic body has come up with an action plan to control vector-borne diseases this year.

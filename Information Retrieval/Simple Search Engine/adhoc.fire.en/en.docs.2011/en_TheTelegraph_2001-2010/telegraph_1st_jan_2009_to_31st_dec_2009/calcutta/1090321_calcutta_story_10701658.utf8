	It was a special day for Dipankar Goldar, a 20-year-old student of the Calcutta Deaf and Dumb School. The braveheart, who has represented India in football at the Paralympics, was chosen the Best Participant in a four-day expedition to the Garumara forest range in north Bengal last month.        
	He was among the 16 differently abled youths who took part in the Beyond Belief Expedition Challenge, which was organised by the Kolkata Sukriti Foundation and Lions Club International. On Friday, the team members received cash prizes, certificates and job offers at a ceremony at Rotary Sadan. The youngest participant, Rimo Saha, was adjudged the best Samaritan.        
	The 16 adventurers  of whom four have upper limb impairment, four have lower limb impairment, four are visually impaired and the others are speech and hearing impaired  were divided into four teams titled Alpha, Bravo, Charlie and Delta.        
	A 25-minute film on their experiences was screened on Friday. The youths hiked through steep trails, helping their team members in special hiking-friendly wheelchairs ordered from the UK, forded through water bodies and travelled across the Garumara range in trolleys.        
	The most difficult bit was crossing the sandy terrain with my team members. But Ill do it again if Im asked to, smiled Dipankar.        
	This was the second such event organised by the foundation. Last year we took a team to Sutan in Bankura. It is important for these students to prove that they dont suffer from any disability, said Abhijit Dasgupta, the secretary of the foundation.        
	Each participant had an inspiring story. Like Prabir Sarkar, 29, who with an impaired left leg, won a silver in long jump at the 2002 Asian Games in South Korea. For me, all of them are winners, said General Shankar Roy Choudhury, a guest at the event.

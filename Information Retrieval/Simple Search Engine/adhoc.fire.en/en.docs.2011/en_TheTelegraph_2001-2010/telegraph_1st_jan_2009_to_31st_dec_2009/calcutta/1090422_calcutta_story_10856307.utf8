	The Indian Institute of Management Calcutta has started its first training programme for probationary railway officers.        
	Forty-three engineering service officers and 17 civil service officers are attending the 12-week course in general management, which started on April 6.        
	According to a memorandum of understanding between the IIM and the railways, five batches of probationary officers will be trained in general management on the Joka campus, starting this year.         
	The course is part of the 18-month training of probationary officers, which includes classes at Railway Staff College, Vadodara, and specialised training institutes, and fieldwork in the railways divisions and manufacturing units.        
	The training is among our series of collaboration with the railways, said Bodhibrata Nag, one of the programme directors.        
	Train delayed: The New Jalpaiguri-bound Darjeeling Mail was delayed for around an hour on Tuesday night after its engine developed a snag outside Sealdah station.

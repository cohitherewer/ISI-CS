The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Separate lounge for Haj fliers
                                                                                                               Separate lounge for Haj fliers
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A separate lounge has been set up at Calcutta airport for the Haj pilgrims who will fly to Medina and Jeddah from Tuesday to November 13 to avoid congestion in the international terminal.        
	The old arrival terminal, adjoining the international terminal, has been upgraded to accommodate the Haj passengers.        
	This has been done to avoid congestion in the international departure lounge, airport director R. Srinivasan said on Monday.        
	About 19,000 pilgrims are expected to take Air Indias flights to Medina and Jeddah from Calcutta this year compared with 15,800 last year.         
	Till last year, the international terminal used to accommodate the Haj passengers. The Haj flights are during the day, a lean period for other international flights. Most international flights take-off and land later at night or early in the morning, said an airport official.        
	Introduction of a number of day flights to Dhaka and Southeast Asia has sparked congestion fears this year, added the official.        
	The old arrival terminal was in use till 1995. The 10,000sq ft area now has X-ray machines for scanning registered baggage, check-in, immigration and customs counters, banking facilities and washrooms for Haj pilgrims.         
	Seats for 430 passengers, medical counters and food and drinking water facilities are being set up.         
	A shamiana covering 11,000sq ft has also been put up for fliers arriving from Patna and Ranchi.         
	Airport officials said four special flights would arrive from Patna daily from Tuesday to November 2. The passengers would then take a bigger Boeing 747-400 to Medina. From November 2 to 13, two special flights would arrive from Ranchi daily.        
	According to an official, the airport authorities are exploring the option of using the upgraded lounge for special purposes.

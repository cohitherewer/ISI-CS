                                                                                                               Flout greets drive debut
                                          
	On Day I of the month-long police drive against traffic rule violators, the Sealdah and Shyambazar traffic guards claimed to have registered 27 and 60 cases, respectively, till 7pm. Metro drove through the city during the day and came across numerous instances of violation, with the men-in-white, wherever present, looking the other way. A list of some of violations              
	Jaywalking        
	Where: Sealdah flyover        
	When: 3.28pm        
	What we saw: Pedestrians are not supposed to be allowed on the flyover but a young woman, her school-going daughter in tow, was seen talking on her cellphone while walking across the ramp leading to Sealdah. The two kept walking nonchalantly, ignoring cars and buses whizzing past. Asked why she was violating the rule, the woman shot back: None of your business.              
	Rash driving         
	Where: Sealdah bus stop        
	When: 3.35pm        
	What we saw: Buses, racing one another, were halting away from the designated points. One of the two traffic constables posted at the site said: There isnt much we can do. We can only handle so much traffic at a time.              
	Riding without a helmet        
	Where: AJC Bose Road, between the Ripon Street crossing and Mullickbazar        
	When: 3.49pm        
	What we saw: Two youths, neither wearing a helmet, were riding a motorcycle without paying heed to traffic signals.         
	They wound their way through slow-moving vehicles before jumping a red signal and zooming off.              
	Parking in no-parking zones         
	Where: Park Street, leading towards Park Circus        
	When: 3.52pm        
	What we saw: Several cars were parked on a stretch of Park Street and at the Park Circus seven-point crossing, which are no-parking zones.        
	A sergeant posted at the crossing said: These are just a few exceptions. Had we been lax in enforcing the law, the prosecution count in the city could not have been so high.

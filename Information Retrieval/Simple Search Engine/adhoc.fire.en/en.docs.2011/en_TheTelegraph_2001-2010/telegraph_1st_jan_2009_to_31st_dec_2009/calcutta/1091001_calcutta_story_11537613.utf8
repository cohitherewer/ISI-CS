The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Merc switches gears 
                                                                                                               Merc switches gears 
  - New E-Class now, larger store next year          ANASUYA BASU                          FAST FORWARD: The new E-Class                                        
	Mercedes, the German marque, is revving up for the war of luxury wheels in Calcutta with an E-Class launch and plans for a larger showroom.         
	Mercs ninth generation E-Class model will be unveiled in the city on Saturday and a 4S showroom offering sales, service, spares and systems under one roof will come up next year. Interkrafts, the sole Merc dealer in town, is banking on the new E-Class to increase sales by 20 per cent over last years figure of 82 units.         
	We already have three advance bookings in the bag. We are not accepting any more bookings till we are sure of the allotments for the city. There have been 25 to 30 enquiries about the new E-Class, said Hiteswar Singh, the CEO of Interkrafts.        
	Mercedes has been facing stiff competition from another German giant, BMW. While BMW had sold 72 units by July, Mercedess mid-year count was 47.        
	The new E Class (W212) will be available in its petrol variant (350 Avant Garde) for Rs 46,98,000 (ex-Delhi). It is expected to ramp up Mercs market share of 36 per cent in the segment, rivalling BMWs 5 series and Audis A6.         
	The BMW dealership, OSL Prestige, is a 3S facility spread over 4,300sq ft on the EM Bypass. A 6,000sq ft, six-bay workshop has been set up at Sarkarpool.         
	Another player in the luxury segment, Audi of the Volkswagen Group, will be making its debut in the city by the end of the year. Audi is due to have its first showroom and workshop on AJC Bose Road.         
	Wilfried Aulbur , the managing director and CEO of Mercedes Benz India, outlined the companys expansion plans at the launch of the ninth generation E-class in Delhi last Wednesday. Around Rs 150 crore is being invested to revamp our dealership network. Most of it is being borne by our partners, and the rest by the company, he said.         
	On the Calcutta dealership, the CEO said: Interkrafts has just set up a state-of-the art workshop facility in Behala. They are also investing in a new and bigger showroom that will take about 12 months to come up. Land is being identified for the project.

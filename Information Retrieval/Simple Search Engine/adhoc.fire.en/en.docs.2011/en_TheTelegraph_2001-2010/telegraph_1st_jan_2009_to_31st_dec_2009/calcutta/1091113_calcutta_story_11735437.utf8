  - Enforcers blame confusion over who will pocket fine for lack of action          ZEESHAN JAWED                                                  
	The ban on smoking in public places has gone up in smoke with enforcers citing confusion over the fine line.        
	In the 13 months that the ban has been in place, not a single person has been penalised despite rampant violation, apparently because the authorities are not sure who should pocket the fine.        
	The no-smoking notification was issued on May 30, 2008, and the ban came into affect from October 2. Not a single person has been slapped with the fine of Rs 200 for smoking in a public place, admitted a senior official of the states health department.        
	The reason emerging from behind the smokescreen is the lack of clarity about which head of accounts the fine will be collected under. How can we fine people when we do not know where and under which head we will deposit the money? In case we start slapping people with fines, where will we deposit the money? argued the official.        
	Isnt that just another excuse for non-action? Well, we have requested the states finance department to create an account for the fine to be collected but they have not responded. The process of penalising violators is not likely to start anytime soon, added the health official.        
	On another count, however, the health department cannot pass the buck. To implement the ban in government offices the department had formed a joint task force of representatives from various departments to sensitise institutions. In 13 months, the task force has not managed to meet even once.                          
	The health department has failed to create awareness about the ban. According to the act, it is mandatory to put up 60cm/30cm signs with No-smoking area, smoking here is an offence in red against a white background in government offices and public places.        
	Tax inspectors, station masters, gazetted officers, postmasters, public and private office heads, librarians and airport officers have been empowered to slap the fine.        
	But in most cases there is no sign of the signs and offices and institutions have not even received the challans that violators need to be handed over.        
	So, the next time you see the ban going up in smoke at a restaurant or hospital, blame it on yet another case of official apathy.

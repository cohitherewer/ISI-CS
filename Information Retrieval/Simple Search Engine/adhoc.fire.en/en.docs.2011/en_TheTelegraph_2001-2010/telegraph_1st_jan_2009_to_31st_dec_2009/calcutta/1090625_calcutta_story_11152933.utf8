The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Reform of railroko   Trinamul takes a new track
                                                                                                               Reform of rail roko 
  Trinamul takes a new track    - BLOCKADES LEAD TO TRAIN DELAYS: MAMATA      AMRITA GHOSH AND SANJAY MANDAL                          Trinamul Congress supporters block railway tracks at Dasnagar station in 2008. (Gopal Senapati)                                              
	Right to protest is a fundamental right. Bandhs and blockades do inconvenience passengers but we have to do it to protest the governments anti-people policies.        
	 Mamata Banerjee,
  Trinamul Congress chief        
	I am taking up a drive to improve punctuality of trains. We are trying to achieve 85 per cent punctuality. Bandhs, blockades and other factors often lead to delays.        
	 Mamata Banerjee,
  Railway minister        
	The ascension of the queen of bandhs and blockades to the railway ministers throne has forced her rail roko army to add restraint to their lexicon and allowed railway officers to breathe easy.        
	We have been verbally instructed by party leaders not to block rail tracks. I shall soon convene a meeting of the block presidents to tell them not to block trains as part of demonstrations, said Braja Mohan Majumder, the Howrah district president of the Trinamul Congress.         
	Sasthi Gayen, serial train-stopper and Trinamul Congress president of the Bally-Jagachha block, is aware that a change of job profile is in the offing.        
	From now on, I must seek the permission of the district leadership before blocking a rail track, said Gayen, rather sheepishly.        
	Minutes before that he was recounting with pride how he had in 2007 stopped the Rajdhani Express near Rajchandrapur to protest the Eastern Railways decision to evict illegal settlers around the station. And more recently how he had blocked Bally Halt station to protest Didis convoy being stopped on its way to Singur.        
	Rail roko inconveniences passengers, but it is the best way to draw the attention of the authorities, said the man who must now get used to life without the minimum-effort-maximum-impact protest tool.        
	If Mamatas men learn their manners, railway officials will be a relieved lot. Since 1997, the Trinamul has been responsible for the most rail blockades, and 90 per cent of these have been on non-railway issues, said an official of Eastern Railways Sealdah division.        
	In the last Mamata bandh in June 2008, Trinamul men had driven Metro Railway staff members out of the Tollygunge and Dum Dum stations, and halted services. In the first few months of 2009, the Trinamul was guilty of around 20 train blockades in the city and its suburbs, railway sources said.        
	Then, the states Opposition powerhouse became the countrys railway boss. After Mamata Banerjee took over on May 22, there has been no rail blockade by her party, said a senior railway official.         
	A train blockade for even two hours can disrupt services for an entire day, with the ripple effect being felt in different sections of a division, hitting suburban and long-distance trains. All it takes is a small group to squat on the tracks or toss some banana leaves on the overhead wires.        
	Now that she is the minister, her supporters will not stage blockades and embarrass her, smiled an official.        
	Mamatas push for railway punctuality is welcome news for Trinamul bandh victim Gautam Munshi. The 41-year-old resident of Mohanpur in Howrah can never forget how a Trinamul rail roko in 2007 had almost claimed the life of his brother Pritam, 37.        
	My brother was in severe pain after suffering a spinal cord injury. I was rushing him to SSKM Hospital. The local train we boarded for Howrah stopped at Phuleswar because the tracks had been blocked by Trinamul supporters. My brother slumped in my arms; he barely survived the ordeal, recounted Gautam, hoping that Mamatas partymen would no longer punish train passengers to achieve their political goals.

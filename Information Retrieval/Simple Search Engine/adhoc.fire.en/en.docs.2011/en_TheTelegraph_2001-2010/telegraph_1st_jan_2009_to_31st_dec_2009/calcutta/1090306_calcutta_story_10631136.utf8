The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Court rejects surgeons plea
                                                                                                               Court rejects surgeons plea
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Thursday dismissed a petition by eye surgeon Vijay Pahwa, challenging the legality of the state medical councils proceedings against him for alleged negligence leading to a patients death.        
	The council has started the proceedings on the basis of a complaint by Utsav Basu, a resident of Mahanirban Road, who blamed Pahwas negligence for his wifes death in 2004.        
	There is now no bar on the council to take steps against the doctor, said the councils lawyer Saibalendu Bhowmik. The council has the right to cancel Pahwas registration if he is found guilty of negligence.        
	The case diary states that Bandana Basu, who had been suffering from cataract in her left eye, had been advised by Pahwa to undergo a phacomulsification surgery.        
	The 56-year-old died while being operated upon at Pahwas Russel Street nursing home on November 11, 2004. A probe by the health department revealed that the clinic was functioning without a licence and the patient died because of the surgeons negligence, Bhowmik said.        
	Pahwa, however, said Basu died of a cardiac arrest. He also claimed that as a doctor, he could run a clinic without a licence. While dismissing his petition, the division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice B. Somadder said: The doctor tried to restrain the council by filing cases.

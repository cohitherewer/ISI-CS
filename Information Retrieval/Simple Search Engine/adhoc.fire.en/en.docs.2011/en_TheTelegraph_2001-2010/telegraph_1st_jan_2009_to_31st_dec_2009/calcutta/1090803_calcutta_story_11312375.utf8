The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Elephant steals a Puja march

	A Salt Lake puja committee is making sure that it cuts through the clutter in the race for sponsorship with the downturn likely to tell on festival budgets.         
	BG Block Residents Association Sarbojanin Durgotsav, which turns 25 this year, got off the starting line with a flourish on Sunday morning, making an elephant lead a colourful procession down the streets of the township.        
	Pedestrians stopped in their strides, residents watched bewildered from verandahs and motorists slowed their cars to stare as 35-year-old Champa ambled down the Broadway in Sector II.        
	The elephant is a symbol of prosperity. So we thought of hiring one for our silver jubilee puja opening. No one in Salt Lake has ever seen such a sight, Soumitra Shaw, the chief patron of the puja committee, said.         
	Keeping Champa company was a horse drawing a decorated carriage, followed by twin files of women in red-bordered white saris, striding to the frenzied beats of 25 drummers. A priest did Chandipaath on a loudspeaker from a Matador.        
	With them marched residents of the block, including five little ones dressed as Durga and her divine children. The elderly and the children who could not keep up followed in cars.         
	The committee spent Rs 50,000 on the one-hour procession, organised with the help of an event management company.        
	Many other blocks in Salt Lake are turning 25 this year. We have scored over them in novelty, said Sanchaita Das, whose husband Dipankar is one of the puja co-ordinators.         
	The procession is just one of the publicity aces up the blocks sleeve. Last week we launched a website www.bgblock.com. Our sponsors would be able to put their ads on the website which would be linked to their own homepages. We also have a database of over 2,000 mobile numbers of block residents to whom we are starting to send regular text messages, said Pradyumna Sinha, a convener.        
	The service started with texted announcements of the procession plan and the news of the tuskers arrival at the puja site.         
	The blocks Puja budget is Rs 16 lakh, a steep jump over last years figure of Rs 6 lakh.         
	Sinha pointed out that the procession would reach a message to potential sponsors that the organisers had out-of-the-box ideas and would succeed in drawing footfall. Our package has already impressed three sponsors.         
	Puja fashion also started early in BG Block, with women turning up in finery. Who knows if it will rain during Puja. Its better to start early, said Debjani Shaw, sporting a new Kanjeevaram.         
	This year, according to the almanacs, the Devi arrives in a palanquin, a portent of famine. But to the BG Block pandal, the Mother Goddess, welcomed with the elephant, seems to be taking a different mode of transport, ensuring prosperity.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Happy screen days are here again
                                                                                                               Happy screen days are here again
  - New York and a crop of Hollywood hits end box-office drought          PRIYANKA ROY                          New York has had a super first weekend                                        
	After a long dry spell, a cloudburst at the parched plexes.        
	The two-month lull in Bollywood content has ended in the box-office storm of New York  the first starry release after the plex-producer standoff ended on June 5  with weekend footfall hitting the 90-95 per cent range, a first in 2009.        
	The weekend footfalls went through the roof, with New York registering about six-eight houseful shows at each of our properties. Even weekday occupancies have been 75-80 per cent, said Virendra Marya, the regional director of INOX.        
	The John Abraham-Katrina Kaif-Neil Nitin Mukesh starrer is clearly cashing in on the first mover advantage after the Bollywood drought. The audience was starved of a big Bollywood film. The Yash Raj film has brought the audience back, corporate bookings and all, said a plex spokesperson.                  Terminator Salvation is a big draw      
	New York is not the only reason why happy days are here again at the plexes. The cinegoer, forced to subsist on a Holly-heavy diet for weeks, seems to have got a taste of English films. Action flicks Terminator Salvation and X-Men Origins: Wolverine have combined with hit comedy The Hangover to give multiplexes a lot to smile about.        
	Terminator Salvation had takers from Day One, while footfall for The Hangover has jumped following word-of-mouth publicity, said the two Fame plexes. Angels amp; Demons, too, is still going strong.        
	With queries for this Fridays blockbuster Kambakkht Ishq pouring in and Shortkut, Love Aaj Kal, Luck and Kaminey to follow, the plex fun has just begun.

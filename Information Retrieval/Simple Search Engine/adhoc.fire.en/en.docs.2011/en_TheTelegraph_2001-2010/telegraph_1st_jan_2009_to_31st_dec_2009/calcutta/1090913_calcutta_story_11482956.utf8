The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | No love like old love
                                                                                                               No love like old love
										      Autumn Flush                        A still from the film based on Gabriel Garcia Marquezs Love in the Time of Cholera				                           
	As we grow into senior citizens, we lose many of our instincts and senses. Shakespeare expressed it cruelly, as was his wont. The last scene, he says in this strange eventful history of the Seven Ages of Man, is second childishness and strange oblivion, sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.        
	Having been promoted to the first stage of the last process by retirement, I am forced to concur. I look around me at friends who began the process before me and I must acknowledge that ol Shakespeare knew a thing or two. Many of these friends wear dentures, most have gone either very grey or bald, nearly all must submit sooner rather than later to surgery for the eyes.        
	I am happy to report however, that while all of them are medically forbidden either sugar, or alcohol or carbohydrates or red meat or cholesterol-rich foods, NONE of them has really lost the sense of taste yet.        
	Thus it is that very often in Calcuttas office para, you will see them complete with spectacles, orthopaedic walking implements or hearing aids, at a favourite restaurant. They are sometimes accompanied by a spouse or other old friends from a depleting stag or hen adda. Sometimes they rustle up for lunch an old girl or boyfriend from the old days and these meetings have to be some of the most romantic that I have ever seen.        
	The waiters respond to these old timers with old-time courtesy: Bahut din ke baad aaye hain sahib! You can tell which ones were popular because of the size of their tips or their general concern for the waiters. Someone without the generosity and obviously with his elderly wife in tow, gets a cheeky: Saab aaj memsaab nahin aye hai? This causes instant problems: Which memsaab did you come here with on a regular basis? No jealousy like an old one, either.        
	The other day one such gentleman came into a little Chinese restaurant and was welcomed with warmth by the waiters. He was dressed in spotless white kurta and aligarhi and charming in his responses. A surgery for something in the ear-nose-throat area had left him with an ugly scar and a voice that was thin and reedy. But he had a majestic air about him and looked up eagerly every time the door opened.         
	She arrived a few minutes later: an Anglo-Indian lady in a bright salwar kameez. She had used a fair amount of make-up to cover the wrinkles and she walked in saying Asif! while he responded with infinite tenderness: Sheila! For a long time they were just content to hold hands and chatter inconsequentially. The waiters and we looked on with indulgence. Asif ordered a beer for himself and a vodka collins for her with the confidence of long practice. Ive been so worried about you, Asif!         
	No more of that, Sheila! I have missed you too! They ordered lunch but didnt eat much of it. You dont seem to be enjoying the food, he said. We could have gone to the Hyatt Regency or the Taj Bengal. You know I always love coming here, she replied. I wonder why? and a merry tinkle of laughter erupted from Sheila.         
	We eavesdropped shamelessly. Remember how you always brought me here on a Saturday? You said it brought you luck at the races!         
	Lets go to the races! he said. I could do with some of that luck now!         
	Oh Asif! Naughty boy! Naughty as ever! This last was accompanied by a girlish giggle but a sudden intake of breath revealed a long held anxiety.        
	His mobile rang. No Raj, I am at a restaurant! With whom? Ah, wouldnt you like to know. Here, speak to her.         
	Hi Raj! Im Asifs friend, Sheila. Remember me? No, he is fine! He looks terrific as always! No mention of the voice. No I havent seen it yet! Let me ask Asif.         
	They went on to see Om Shanti Om together, a film also about nostalgia. We went home happier for the experience of seeing two people being young again together, despite illness, separation and age.

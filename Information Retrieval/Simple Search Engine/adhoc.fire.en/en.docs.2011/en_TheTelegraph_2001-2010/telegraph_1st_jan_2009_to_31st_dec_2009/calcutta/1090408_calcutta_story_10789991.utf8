The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Film school head meets students
                                                                                                               Film school head meets students
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The chairman of the Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute, Buddhadeb Dasgupta, met a group of more than 50 students on Tuesday afternoon to discuss the problems that led to the campus being shut down indefinitely last week.         
	The students said they had spelt out their grievances against the inefficiency and apathy of the authorities and voiced their demands during the hour-long interaction.         
	Members of the student body are now looking forward to a governing council meeting on April 16, promised by Dasgupta. The meeting was earlier scheduled on April 10.        
	We had a very cordial meeting with the chairman, who showed concern for our grievances. He wants us to resume classes and even offered to take some of our classes. But we want the general council meeting to take place before that so that we can officially clarify our stand and voice our concerns. We have prepared a 10-page list of demands, said a member of the student body.        
	Buddhadeb Dasgupta said: I just had an informal meeting with the students. Im not in a position to say anything more.        
	According to the students, the issues raised in the meeting included the lack of proper faculty in the cinematography, direction and screenplay departments and neglect of equipment in the camera department. Reduction in the number of projects in the specialisation year and damage to rare prints in the film archive were also brought up.        
	The general council meeting is usually held four times a year and during an emergency. It is convened by the director of the institute and attended by the chairman, two representatives of the information and broadcasting ministry, an ex-student and two or three filmmakers.        
	Since this is an emergency meeting, we requested our chairman if some current students could also attend it. The meeting is likely to take place outside the campus, said one of the students.        
	The chairman met the director, dean and other senior administrative officials of the institute on Monday evening after returning from Hyderabad.        
	We have apprised him of the situation. Now let him decide, said Swapan Mullick, the director of the school.        
	All I have to say is that the students must act with reason and make amends for what they did in the heat of the moment. Were waiting for them to tender an unconditional apology and return the telephones, DVD player and TV set they had removed from the directors room, he added.

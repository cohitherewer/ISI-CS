The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Journey through folk songs

	Folk music, for all its rich tradition, is lost to the urbane audience but it is not dead  or even dying. It lives in harsh and painful circumstances and thrives on pain, in the throes of loss, in the spirituality arising out of acceptance.        
	On Saturday evening, singer/researcher Maushumi Bhowmik offered glimpses into this spiritual music in an intimate performance-presentation on the music of divided Bengal at Studio 21. Moving With Music: A Journey Through the Folk Repertoire of Bengal also featured dotara player/singer Satyaki Banerjee, now a regular with Chennai-based world folk outfit Oikyotaan, and sound engineer and researcher Sukanta Mazumdar.        
	All three have been supporters of the Baul-Fakir Utsav at Shaktigarh, Jadavpur, a folk music festival that has been running without any major sponsorship over the past four years.        
	The evening began with Ronen Roychowdhurys daughter Jhuns a-capella rendition of Dayani rakhibaye morey. Her fathers rendition of the same was played back, with the small audience soaking in the feeling of the words with the tune.        
	With support from the India Foundation for the Arts, Maushumi, Satyaki and Sukanta have been following the music, through Sylhet, Faridpur, east London.        
	Maushumi talked of her meetings with theatre legend Khaled Choudhury, talking to him about the implications of the Partition and the importance of the music, the udbaastu gaan that he carried in his soul post-political divisions. He talked of a certain fruit that he had tasted decades ago, as a child, and the way he spoke about it, it was apparent that he still carries that taste on his tongue. Sur  melody  and stories are like taste, like smell: you carry your lands own all through life, explained Maushumi.        
	At the same time, she spoke of Helal, a Cockney-speaking third-generation Bangladeshi immigrant youth from east London who knows but another language: Sylheti. When he sings, you can feel the ghorer taan, said Maushumi, as Helals rendition of Karim Shahs Bande maya lagaise played on.        
	East London merged into Faridpur as Maushumi spoke of the Oxford School of Sufism, basically a pool club where Bengali youths shoot pool, play folk music on the jukebox and have even set up a mini-mountain of burning candles in a corner, quite like a dargah.        
	Like the London sojourns, there have been journeys across Bangladesh, in search of the blind singer Ibrahim, from Bhasaanchar, Faridpur; in search of Hamidbhai, whose entire family joins in to sing like a ritual; in search of the ageing singer-songwriter Hejira Bibi, whose last recorded song perhaps is her rendition of Praner Murshid go, that she sang for Maushumi and her associates. There was the eccentric rickshaw-puller Habib, who remembers and sings Hajira Bibis songs, accompanied just by a tea-stall tabletop as tabla.        
	Satyaki regaled the audience with his rendition of Kalipada nilkamaley mojo amar mon bhomora, while Maushumi closed the session at the Dover Terrace address for the arts with Nirale tomare pailam na. Folk music, or any music, can really never die. Songs do not really die; they may fade into oblivion if they are related to specific worklife... but even then, they do not really die, ended Maushumi.

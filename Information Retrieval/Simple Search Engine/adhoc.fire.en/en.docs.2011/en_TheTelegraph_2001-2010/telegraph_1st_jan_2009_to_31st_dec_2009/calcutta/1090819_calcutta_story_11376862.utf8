                                                                                                               Plea against temporary bus permits
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Owners of private buses moved a writ petition in the high court on Tuesday, challenging a recent notification of the state transport department inviting applications for temporary permits by owners of chartered buses.         
	Justice Tapen Sen admitted the case for hearing next week.        
	The petitioners, Swapan Ghosh and other private bus owners, claimed the transport department had violated a rule by issuing the notification.        
	On August 3, the department had issued a notification inviting applications from owners of chartered buses, having contract carriage permits, for plying their vehicles from Howrah, Salt Lake and Esplanade to various destinations. The notification stated that buses with 30-plus seats and manufactured after April 1, 2004, would be eligible for the temporary permits.        
	According to transport rules, there is no provision to grant permits to buses that have contract carriages permits to ply as stage carriages, the petitioners contended.        
	They also claimed that the government had no authority to issue temporary permits.         
	Permits for plying buses as stage carriages can be awarded for five years. But the August 3 notification had stated that temporary permits would be given for only 12 weeks, the petition said.        
	Advocate Aravinda Mukherjee mentioned the matter before Justice Sen on Tuesday and sought an early hearing. As the case was not listed on the daily cause list, the judge said he would hear the matter next week.        
	The governments lawyer claimed Section 87 of the Transport Act allowed the state to issue temporary bus permits on different routes.        
	The intention of the transport notification was clear. The government wanted to meet the crisis caused by the withdrawal of old buses, said N.I. Khan, counsel for the state.        
	According to the petitioners, there is no need to allow additional buses to ply in the city.        
	The notification is creating unnecessary confusion and thats why we want the court to intervene, said a petitioner.

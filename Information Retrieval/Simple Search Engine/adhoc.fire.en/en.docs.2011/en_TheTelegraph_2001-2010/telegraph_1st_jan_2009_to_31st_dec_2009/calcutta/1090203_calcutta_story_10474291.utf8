The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cop plan for Metro safety 
                                                                                                               Cop plan for Metro safety 
          KINSUK BASU                              
	Calcutta police has asked Metro Railways to install baggage scanners and increase the number of security personnel at stations to prevent terror attacks.         
	The police commissioner recently wrote to the Metro Railway authorities suggesting that they put in place an integrated security system, under which physical checking of baggage will be replaced by automatic scanning and more policemen will be deployed in the 17 stations.        
	After the death of 52 people in coordinated bomb blasts in the London Underground trains in 2005, it has become essential to protect all underground railways. We want a permanent security system in place for Metro, said a senior officer of Calcutta police who oversees Metro Railway security.         
	The police proposal is valid. We want to install a baggage check system similar to the airport. A detailed report has been sent to the railways ministry and the nod should come soon. We have sought both portable and large baggage scanners, said J.K. Mitra, the chief operating officer of Metro Railway.        
	According to Metro sources, there is also a plan to use explosive detectors and an electronic surveillance device that will sound an alarm if there is an unclaimed baggage in the station.         
	The police also want about 800 personnel to guard the stations, including the platforms. About 300 police personnel currently serve at the Metro stations in two shifts.Since the funds for the additional deployment must be shared between the state government and the railways ministry, we want a clearance from Metro Railway, said a senior Calcutta police officer.

                      Ancient philosophy for modern living                    Hiranya garbha purusha pradhana avyakta rupine (I bow to Him, the one with the golden womb, who is both the eternal soul [Purush] and nature [Prakriti], the subtle and hidden.)        The Yoga-Sankhya philosophy regards the universe as consisting of two eternal realities: Purusha, the centre of consciousness, and Prakriti, source of all material existence. Together, they formulate the golden womb (hiranya garbha)  the human potential. Inspired by the concepts of spirituality and yoga in dance and its physical representation, Hiranyagarbha  The Golden Womb represents the culmination of the workshop endeavours of the dancers of Natyanova Performing Arts Centre. An interactive performance based on the principles of yoga, it is presented in contemporary style and aims to demystify the intricacies and complexities we generally associate with ancient philosophy, besides helping us manage our lives better. Based on the concept of the Yoga-Sankhya philosophy of the Chakras, the choreography is an interplay of the idea of Shakti as Kundalini, uncoiling as it absolves each Chakra to unite with Shiva. Choreography by Priyadarshini Ghosh, assisted by Mohana Iyer.

                      Black-and-white perspective                    In spite of its pot-holed alleys, dug-up roads, derelict buildings and incomplete flyovers, the city of Calcutta takes on a romantic aspect when visualised through monochromatic film. Combining a melancholy charm with an almost archaic beauty, the city develops a majestic character of its own, reminiscent of the days of its past power, glory and grandeur. Home and the Street, the ongoing group show of black-and-white photographs, features such interesting images of the city along with that of the lives of its inhabitants. Participated by Sumit Basu, Jayanta Saha, Kushal Ray, Nilanjan Ray and Saibal Das, the show focuses on the inner and outer life of a city that is old and crumbling, and yet on the move. Sumit Basus camera pans on artists Shuvaprasanna and Shanu Lahiri at work. Kushal Ray focuses on the everyday drama of an old Calcutta household, presided over by a stately matriarch. Jayanta Sahas compositions are concerned with the interplay of tradition and modernity. A sinister feel pervades the disturbing angles of Saibal Das frames. Apart from scenes of Durga Puja being celebrated in the city, the widows of Varanasi feature in the works of Nilanjan Ray. Curator: Christopher Taylor.

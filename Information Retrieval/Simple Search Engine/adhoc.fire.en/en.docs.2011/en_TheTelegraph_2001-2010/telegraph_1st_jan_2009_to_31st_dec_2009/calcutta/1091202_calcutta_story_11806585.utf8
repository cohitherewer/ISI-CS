	Apropos quot;How smooth was our Metro ride, quot;, September 7, though passengers have faced inconvenience because of the extension of services, the move has benefited lakhs of new passengers. I would like to suggest a few steps that may help improve Metro services:           
	1. The passenger load can be distributed throughout the day by offering incentives for lean hours.           
	2. To reduce load at ticket counters, the validity of multi-ride tickets should be extended and some incentive given in terms of fare.           
	3. Smart card concessions should be available only to below-poverty-line commuters during peak hours. However, a nominal discount should be given to all smart card holders.           
	4. Maintenance should get top priority and carried out at night.

	With reference to the report HC push for pandal rules, September 11, according to court rules, 4, 6 and 10ft space have to be kept open on roads having width up to 15, 20 and 30ft respectively. For roads wider than 30ft, 20ft have to be left open. This means that if a road is 31ft wide, organisers have to build a pandal within 11ft (31-20 = 11ft). It also means that pandals built on 20 and 30 ft wide roads will get more space (20-6 = 14ft and 30-10 = 20ft) than the one on a 31ft wide road.             
	Hundreds of puja pandals are erected in Calcutta, mostly on roads. Where would all of them find parks? The high court had observed that Durga puja is a national festival and public sentiments have to be considered. However, safety, security and the right to free movement are also important. Therefore, some compromises need to be made, with relaxation of rules on a case-to-case basis

	We appreciate the high courts concern with road-hog pandals. But what about areas that are blocked 365 days a year? I live in the Lake Market area, where the Lake Mall is being constructed for the past four years. As a result of the huge construction, Parasar Road is completely blocked. There are two rows of stalls, back-to-back on either side of the road, some stalls right on the road and the rest of the roadspace full of craters. Where will pedestrians walk, with the footpath not visible, part of the 22ft road occupied by vendors and the rest by customers? Some of these vendors have been allocated stalls inside the market, yet they continue to block the thoroughfare under political patronage.

	It is quite encouraging that a section of puja organisers in Calcutta is in favour of lead-free paint on idols. But a majority of the organisers still favour toxic colours. (Kudos for green idol campaign, Sept 7). This needs to change  the sooner, the better.             
	Puja committees should remember that toxic colours may make the idols look bright but immersion of idols with lead-free paints creates less pollution.           
	For this purpose, a campaign needs to be launched at both government and non-government levels. If it proves fruitless, the pollution control board may issue an order banning the use of toxic paints on idols which both the idol-makers and puja organisers will be bound to obey.           
	Dinabandhu Mukherjee, Behala                               
	As an animal lover, I have visited most zoos in India. I was delighted to read the report First master plan in 134 yrs, September 15.             
	The oldest and biggest zoo in India urgently requires modern and spacious cages. Alipore zoo should also plan to breed rare animals and birds and exchange them with zoos abroad. Visitors should not be allowed to enter the premises with food. The zoo must be kept clean with its premises beautified with flowering trees and plants.           
	Bhupen Bose, Dum Dum Park           
	Banning of outside food and plastic bags at the zoo and building bigger enclosures will help the zoo inmates live a better life. One hopes the proposed measures are effected, not only for the sake of the suffering animals but also for children like my five-year old nephew, who after a visit to the zoo last year, refused to go again, saying, It is a sad and dirty place with only sick and dying animals.           
	Lalita Agarwal, Kankurgachhi     
	Sandip Dey, the sergeant who surrendered at Bankshall Court (Sergeant slapped with harass charge, September 5) mistook a married woman for a spinster and offered his heart, lock stock and barrel, to her. The incident gives us a rare insight into the gullibility of our policemen. No wonder convicts dupe our cops so easily and escape from custody regularly.

	Apropos Students fall ill on train, September 11, the railway minister is announcing new trains or extension of routes almost daily. Unfortunately, our trains  even important ones like Rajdhani Express  have smelly toilets and filthy coaches, and the food served by pantry cars and at stations are far from hygienic. So it was no surprise that students travelling from Chennai to Calcutta on Ernakulam-Guwahati Express fell sick after consuming contaminated water and food. Mamata Banerjee must improve services on existing trains before introducing more.             
	A.S. Mehta, New Alipore           
	I request the railway ministry to provide toilets on local trains where passengers travel for two hours or more. This would particularly help senior citizens. This may be done progressively. Initially, some bogies with toilet facility may be attached to each long-distance local and senior citizens, the disabled and ailing passengers can choose these compartments. The railways should also provide wheel chair and easy boarding facilities on trains and at stations.

	The retailers plea to get their rentals slashed, ad infinitum, ostensibly for the downturn (Flash shutdown at mall, September 3) is something logic cannot explain. Why should the realtor slash rentals? Did the retailers pay him extra when the going was good, or had they taken an insurance policy from the owner of the property against low footfall and lower turnover? If neither, what prevents the retailers from vacating the space if they find doing business there not viable? Such behaviour is harming the brand value of names like Pantaloons, Moustache, Guess or Turtle. Indians are known for their reluctance to identify with their poor cousins and struggling nephews. Will they want to sport an apparel brand that cannot foot its own showroom AC bill?             
	Tapan Pal, Batanagar                               
	It is good to learn that many college authorities in the city have issued notices to their students to restrict the use of cellphones on campus (Mobile muzzle on college campus, September 11). The random use of mobile phones in classes and libraries hampers studies. Students may use phones in the canteen and common room, though.             
	Prahlad Agarwala, Majdia, Nadia                               
	Apropos the report Space jam halts port, October 9, I would like to state that at no stage the port authority issued any notice debarring movement of container vessels to and from Calcutta. In fact, on the day the report was published, five container vessels were working at the Calcutta Dock System. More than 350 boxes per day were being delivered from the dock and about 400 boxes per day were being received for exports during that period. Export has been opened for 14 vessels to ensure continuous flow of export cargo.. Regular interactions are being held by the port authority with vessel operators, container operators, CFS operators, clearing agents and various importers and exporters for smooth handling of vessels and containers at the dock. With the help of all the port users, the evacuation process has been streamlined to decongest the dock area.             
	Utpal Sinha, traffic manager, Calcutta Port Trust           
	Metro replies: The report did not mention that the port authorities had sent any formal notice about a space crunch. The suggestion not to bring any ship was made at a meeting with shippers and this subsequently appeared in The Telegraph. The port authority swung into damage control mode a day after and managed to keep the port open, albeit symbolically. Metro stands by its report.                               
	With reference to the report Want to be doc? Read up on Robin Cook, November 27, the text of governor Gopalkrishna Gandhis speech at the convocation of the West Bengal University of Health Sciences on November 26 read: Our state is doing progressively well in the matter of rural healthcare.       Letters on reports appearing   in Metro may be sent to:

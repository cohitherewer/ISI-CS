The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Courts stern eye on teacher assault in class
                                                                                                               Courts stern eye on teacher assault in class
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Chief secretary Ashok Mohan Chakrabarti will have to inform the high court what steps the government has taken against teachers found guilty of beating up students.        
	Home secretary Ardhendu Sen will have to file another affidavit detailing steps the government has taken to implement the ban on corporal punishment.        
	A third affidavit will have to be filed by the secretary of the school education department, who has been asked to compile a list of institutions that have received the state notification announcing the ban.        
	The division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice I.P. Mukherjee passed the series of orders on Friday while hearing a public interest litigation by lawyer Tapas Bhanja, who alleged that corporal punishment in schools was on the rise as the government had failed to enforce the ban.        
	Bhanja submitted that the school education department had not issued any notification announcing the ban, despite being asked to do so by the high court in 2004.        
	Before filing the petition, I visited many schools across the state and enquired whether the authorities had received the notification. Not a single school was aware of the ban, Bhanja said.        
	Two school students in the city died in 2004 after being mercilessly beaten up by their teachers. The deaths prompted the division bench headed by then Chief Justice A.K. Mathur to declare corporal punishment illegal and order the government to issue a notification stating that stern action would be taken against teachers found guilty of torturing students.        
	Copies of the notification were to be sent to the schools.        
	Bhanja, in his petition, mentioned two recent deaths to highlight the states lackadaisical attitude towards enforcing the ban.         
	On November 27, 2008, eight-year-old Iftesham Chowdhury died after being slapped hard by a teacher of Vidya Bharati School, in Mominpur. The teacher, Anita Das, surrendered before the Alipore court and was released on bail.        
	On May 14 this year, 11-year-old Babli Ghosh died after her class teacher in Burdwans Andal Girls High School, Rekha Bhakat, threw a duster at her head. Bhakat has been absconding since.        
	Neither teacher could be arrested. The police should have been more pro-active, Bhanja submitted in the court.        
	The case will be taken up again in the third week of June, by when the senior government officials will submit their affidavits.

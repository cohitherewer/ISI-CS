	The joint head of a Delhi-based tyre manufacturers office in Bowbazar was arrested on Monday night for defrauding the company of Rs 1.13 crore. The other head is on the run.        
	Samir Bhushan Ghosh Majumdar, 42, was produced in Bankshall court on Tuesday and remanded in police custody till July 7. Co-accused Ajit Kumar is absconding.        
	The duo had misappropriated funds between 2005 and April 2009 by transferring company-owned properties in the city to different names. They also fudged bank accounts and submitted false bank statements to the company, said an officer of the detective department.         
	The fraud came to light after Vinod Kumar, the general manager (marketing) of the company, found discrepancies in the accounts.        
	He lodged a complaint with police on April 25.

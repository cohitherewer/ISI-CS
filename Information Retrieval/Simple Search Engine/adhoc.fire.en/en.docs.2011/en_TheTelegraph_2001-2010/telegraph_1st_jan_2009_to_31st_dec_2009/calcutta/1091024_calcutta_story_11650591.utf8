The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Court reopens noise ban case
                                                                                                               Court reopens noise ban case
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          Children light fireworks on Diwali                                  
	The high court on Friday decided to reopen the 14-year-old case that led to a ban on noisy crackers in the state. The case has not been heard for over five years.        
	The decision followed a petition by environment activist Subhas Dutta, who highlighted rampant violation of sound norms in the state during Diwali and Kali puja and sought judicial intervention.        
	The division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice B. Somadder allowed Duttas name to be added as a party to the 1995 case.         
	I will urge the court to form a committee to monitor noise norm violations, the way it was done in the late 1990s, said Dutta.        
	The high court directive that led to the ban was issued on a petition by Om Birangana, a religious society. It moved the court after being stopped by the administration from using a loudspeaker at night.        
	Justice B.P. Banerjee upheld the administrations decision stating that nobody had the right to make others captive listeners.        
	In 1996, the high court had asked the state pollution control board to control noise pollution from various sources, triggering steps to check high-decibel noise from both loudspeakers and fireworks.        
	The maximum permissible noise level for loudspeakers was fixed at 65 decibel. Use of loudspeakers was banned at night and during exams.         
	Based on an expert committee report, the norm for fireworks was set at 90 decibel, 5m from the source. The Supreme Court also played a key role in containing noise menace in the state. In 1997, the apex court had rejected a plea by fireworks manufacturers against the order.        
	On October 5, the Supreme Court again dismissed a petition by fireworks manufacturers from Sivakasi who sought permission to sell in Bengal crackers that produce up to 125 decibel of noise at 4m from the source. Such crackers are allowed under the central noise act but barred in the state.

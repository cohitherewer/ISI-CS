The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Illegal parking claims boy
                                                                                                               Illegal parking claims boy
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	An 11-year-old boy on his way home from tuition fell off his bicycle after it brushed against a bus parked illegally on a narrow road and was run over by a truck near Shalimar station on Tuesday morning.         
	Residents set the truck on fire and damaged six buses, forcing police to resort to lathicharge to disperse them.         
	The mishap occurred on Collegeghat Road around 11.15am while Gokul Podder, a Class V student of Shalimar Hindi High School, was cycling home to Nepal Colony from a coaching centre.        
	Mahesh Sharma, a witness, said: The boy tried to squeeze through the space between the truck, which was coming from the opposite direction, and a parked bus. Unfortunately, his cycles handle brushed against the body of the bus and he fell. The rear wheels of the truck crushed him.        
	There was nothing that the truck driver, who fled, could have done, said witnesses. They blamed the parked buses, which occupy more than a third of the road, for the mishap.        
	Residents went on the rampage almost immediately. Police reached the spot after half an hour and alerted the fire brigade. Firemen took more than two hours to douse the blaze. Krishna Kishore Roy, the local legislator, alleged: I have repeatedly asked the district administration to remove illegally parked vehicles from the road but nothing was done.        
	Hari Kishore Kusumakar, the superintendent of Howrah police, said: I shall ask the bus owners to stop illegal parking within 48 hours. If they fail to do so, we shall tow away the parked buses.        
	nAttack: Alleged CPM supporters attacked Omprakas Jaishawal, the secretary of the Howrah district unit of the Congress, near his Ashu Bose Lane home on Tuesday. The 45-year-old has been admitted to the district hospital.

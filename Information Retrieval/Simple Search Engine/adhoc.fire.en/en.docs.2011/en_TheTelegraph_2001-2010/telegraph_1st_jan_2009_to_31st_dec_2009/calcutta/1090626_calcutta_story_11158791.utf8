The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Teen favours   foster mom
                                                                                                               Teen favours   foster mom
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                          Samirans aunt Prova Bal (Amit Datta)                                        
	A teenager allegedly kept in illegal confinement by the maternal aunt who raised him appeared in court on Thursday to challenge his parents and stand by the accused.        
	My mashi has looked after me well since they (his parents) left me with her immediately after my birth. I have no intention of going back to them, Samiran Sarkar, officially 18 but actually two years younger, told the division bench of Justice D.P. Sengupta and Justice S.K. Chakraborti.        
	The curious case of Samiran came up for hearing after his parents Pankaj and Mithu Sarkar moved a habeas corpus petition accusing the boys maternal aunt, Prova Bal, of forcibly stopping him from returning to them.         
	The Class XII student stunned the court into silence when he said that Prova, who is Mithus elder sister, had been more than a mother to him since his birth and that he could not imagine staying away from her. The court asked both sides to file affidavits and posted the case for hearing after four weeks.         
	Pankaj, an insurance agent, and Mithu, a government employee, are residents of Nadia district. Samiran stays with his maternal aunt in a two-storeyed building owned by her at Chakdah, in the same district.        
	According to Provas counsel Minati Gomes, the 50-year-old did not marry because she wanted to raise Samiran. The boy has been in her custody from the day he was born. Pankaj and Mithu let their son stay with her because they werent financially stable. They now want him back, to which my client has no objection as long as they dont force the boy to do their bidding.        
	Samirans age could have been a factor in the case  anyone who is 18 and above can legally decide who he/she would like to stay with  but Gomes did not dispute the opposing lawyers contention that Samiran was 16 despite officially having turned 18 on March 11. His official age was increased through an affidavit for an exam, she said.        
	The custody battle was first fought in a district court, which ruled in Provas favour. Pankaj and Mithu then filed a habeas corpus petition in the high court on May 27.        
	The Sarkars lawyer, Manas Kumar Das, said: The boys parents are his rightful custodians. But if the court feels he should be in a government shelter for minors till the disposal of the case, my clients would have no objection to it.        
	Gomes said before claiming custody, the parents should have met Samiran regularly and built up a rapport, instead of using force.

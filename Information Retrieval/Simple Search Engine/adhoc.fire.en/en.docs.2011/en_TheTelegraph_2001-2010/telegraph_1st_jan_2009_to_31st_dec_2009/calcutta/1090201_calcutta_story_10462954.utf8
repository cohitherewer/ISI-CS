										      Book fair 2009 brings together poets, restorers, economists and storytellers      BOOK FAIR 2009                              The Scotland pavilion at the Book Fair, managed by the British Council. It has been designed by Graeme Massie, an architect from Scotland. Films from Scotland museums are being screened at the 400 sq m well-lit pavilion with a timber structure. Large banners, descending elegantly from a height, depict Indian collections in Scotlands institutions. One section is devoted to an imaginative display of books.

	James A. Coghlan inherited an interest in India from his great uncle John William Ford Coghlan. The Scottish authors debut novel, The Impossible Journey, reconstructs Johns life as a rifleman in the British Army in India and his journey from Rawalpindi to London in the late 1930s as an intelligence officer.         
	I met him just once for a few minutes. He never spoke about his life as he was an intelligence officer, remembers Coghlan. It was after his great uncles death that details of this life were discovered by the family from a box of negatives and photographs.         
	The story begins with John leaving home to join the army and moves on to his life in the barracks in various parts of India like Lucknow and Delhi. A job as a photographer in the intelligence cell. And then the journey across the borders and many countries Pakistan, Afghanistan, France and Nazi Germany with a team of five colleagues to reach London. The story ends with the death of the other five and James, the sole survivor returning to Scotland for a short vacation.         
	In reality, he came back, got married and started a new life, but he never spoke of this, says the author.         
	Interestingly, the book is published by a publishing company in Howrah.         
	I met Suman Chakraborty at university and we have been friends ever since. When I told him about the book, he wanted to publish it, says the author, whose next book will be a crime novel.         
	The protagonist is from Lahore, he says.

	Geeta Dutt, the dreamy, sensuous voice of Hindi playback of the Fifties and Sixties, was known for her ability to sing everything  from bhajans, dance numbers to a weepy tune. Geeta Dutt: The Skylark, is a biography of the prolific singer by filmmaker Haimanti Banerjee.        
	She has made films on Balgandharva, the legendary actor of Marathi stage known for playing female roles, which won a National Award, and on Santiniketan.         
	For the book on Geeta Dutt, which took five years to write, Banerjee visited Arun Dutt, the singers son, who allowed her access to Guru Dutts letters to Geeta from the early 1950s, when the Pyaasa director was courting her. She has also used photographs from Dutts personal life, which, says Banerjee, have never been seen before. These include photographs of the singer with Guru Dutt and after the birth of her son.                 Geeta Dutt and (below) Nishad Deshmukh. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta		        
	Among the material she researched were film magazines dating from the Fifties, such as Film Sangeet, Rasarang and Rajatpat in Hindi. Sadly, the book, priced at Rs 495, suffers from poor editing and page layout by an untried hand.         
	Diversity talk        
	The January 30 evening at Willow amp; Birch of The Park had the glitterati of the publishing industry from the city attending as did visitors from Scotland. Engaging them was a rather intriguing topic: Why diversity in publishing helps expand markets, hosted by the British Council as part of its Scotland-Calcutta Book Fair programmes. Among the panelists was S. Anand of Navayana Publishing, who was the International Young Publishing Entrepreneur of 2007. Anand had been approached by the British Council to come up with a topic for discussion. And true to his calling, Anand wanted the agenda of Dalits and minorities in Indian publishing discussed and compared with that of Scotland. That happened in no small measure.         
	It was an evening of serious issues. The five-member panel, including Anand himself, had among them a veteran publishing professional Ron Grosset of Geddes and Grosset that specialised in reference and childrens books. Grosset also headed the Arts Council which lead an inclusive programme of inducting the ethnic minorities into the trade. Barrie Sherwin of Barrington Stoke did books for dyslexic children. James Bridle of Bookkake talked of gay and alternate sexuality publishing while Peter Collingwood, a consultant, warned the audience about being too inclusive.         
	Earlier in the evening, Hari Kunzru, in his keynote address, underlined the need for freedom of speech and publication in reactionary regimes like Myanmar, Malaysia and China. The programme wrapped up on a lighter note with the Young Publishing Entrepreneur Award ceremony. Nishad Deshmukh of Nashik won the 2009 title for his Career Publications that does pharma books.

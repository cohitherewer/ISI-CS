The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | United colours of bandh-obast   Rival unions gang up to beat the ban
                                                                                                               United colours of bandh-obast 
  Rival unions gang up to beat the ban          A STAFF REPORTER                                              Graphic: Manoj Roy       
	The great political divide in Bengal has been bridged by the desperate  or rather diabolical  bid to ensure that the Calcuttan on the street continues to inhale poison air.        
	Transport operators of every political hue on Wednesday joined ranks and moved towards an indefinite strike to cripple the citys transport system from July 22 before the governments belated bid to meet the court deadline for phase-out of commercial vehicles older than 15 years.        
	Buses, minibuses, taxis and autos, we will fight together across party lines in order to resist the governments totalitarian move to implement the ban, said Swarnakamal Saha, the president of the Citu-affiliated Bengal Bus Syndicate.        
	The day after the state transport department announced the crackdown on old vehicles from July 25, bus, minibus and auto operators from the Left and Trinamul camps buried their differences and went into a huddle.        
	Not surprisingly, they emerged with their highest common factor  an indefinite bandh from July 22.         
	The strike, if it does take place, would take over 42,000 taxis, 10,000 buses, 1,000 minibuses and 60,000 (registered and unregistered) autos off the roads, paralysing the citys transport system.        
	Around 2,550 buses, 570 minibuses and 6,350 taxis fall under the purview of the phase-out. The ban on two-stroke autos would force around 30,000 registered and 30,000 unregistered autos off the road.        
	In July 2008, the high court had set March 31, 2009, as the deadline for old commercial vehicles. This was extended till July 31 following a government plea in March this year. The court has made it clear that the government  which has done precious little to meet the phase-out deadline  will not be given any further extension.        
	Swarnakamal Saha and Sadhan Das of the Joint Council of Bus Syndicates met Trinamul leader Sovandeb Chattopadhyay at his residence on Wednesday morning. Chattopadhyay spearheads the Auto Bachao Committee, the umbrella body of auto operators battling to beat the ban on polluting three-wheelers.        
	We are fully sympathetic to the cause and they (the bus and taxi unions) have our support. But whether we can participate in the strike has to be decided by the party and by our leader Mamata Banerjee, Chattopadhyay told Metro.        
	But wont the Left and Trinamul boarding the same bandh bus pose a political problem for the parties? In the face of such tyranny and torture (by the state administration), political differences fade, announced Saha.        
	Abashesh Daw, the general secretary of the Left-affiliated Minibus Coordination Committee, echoed Saha.        
	Taxi Bachao Committee, the umbrella body of taxi operators, had announced their indefinite strike from July 22 on Tuesday to protest government atrocities in trying to implement the ban.        
	If Tarak Nath Bari, the secretary of the RSP-affiliated Calcutta Taxi Association, hailed the unified approach vaulting political boundaries, the Citu state committee secretary Debanjan Chakraborty said this is beyond politics, as the ban would affect the livelihood of a few lakhs.        
	That delaying or defying the ban would affect the lungs  and lives  of more than a crore, does not seem to matter.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Student protests rock film school
                                                                                                               Student protests rock film school
          MOHUA DAS AND KUSHALI NAG                                    
	Satyajit Ray Film amp; Television Institute (SRFTI) was plunged into a crisis on Tuesday with around 40 students staging a gherao and demanding the resignation of dean Adinath Das, director Swapan Mullick, administrative officer Sudhin Banerjee and the head of the purchase department.        
	Students didnt allow the officials to leave the campus till late on Tuesday. Police and then RAF had to be called in. The superintendent of South 24-Parganas police, Ajey Ranade, and the district magistrate also rushed to the campus.         
	So far the students have not taken the law into their hands. We will take immediate action if there is any law and order problem, said Ranade around midnight.        
	The cinematography and direction departments were the first to shut down in the morning with the sound and editing departments being affected later in the day and growing talk on campus of a complete shutdown from Wednesday.        
	After initially denying student trouble on the EM Bypass campus, director Mullick admitted late on Tuesday that an agitation had rocked the institute, but tried to play down the unrest.        
	The students want certain facilities  a few film prints from the archive, which have not been well preserved, plus the out-of-order DVD player which they want us to repair immediately. These are minor problems which we cannot look into because of lack of manpower, said the director.        
	Students cite lack of faculty and facilities as their peeve point. Trouble had been brewing with students of the cinematography department protesting the lack of permanent faculty members, the stopgap heads of department, irregular classes and lack of camera workshops.        
	The students accused Banerjee, Das and Mullick of shirking their responsibility, and blamed the head of the purchase department for his inability to procure the promised film equipment.        
	Flashpoint was reached on Tuesday with a group of first-year students locking up the senior officials in one of the administrative rooms on the first floor and allegedly disconnecting phone lines.        
	There were reports of a clash between students and clerical staff who tried to intervene and rescue the officials from the gherao. Cops were called in to restore order and the talks table was set late on Tuesday.        
	We have never denied the students their dues. Maybe a DVD player is not functioning well or a film print isnt available, but we are giving them all other important facilities. We are looking for a solution. The faculty members are talking to them and I hope there will be some kind of settlement soon, said Mullick.

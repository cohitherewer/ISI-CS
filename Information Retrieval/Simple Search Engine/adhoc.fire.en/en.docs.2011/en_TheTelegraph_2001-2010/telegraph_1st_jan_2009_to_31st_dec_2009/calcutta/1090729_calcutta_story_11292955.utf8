          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	A high court division bench on Tuesday directed an estranged couple and their seven-month-old son to stay together in a rented house, away from their other family members, for a fortnight to settle their differences.        
	The judges also offered to discuss the couples problems with them after two weeks.        
	Pallavi Banerjee, 20, who married Avijit Chatterjee in August 2007, had accused her in-laws of torturing her.        
	On March 3, 2008, I was forced to move to my parents house. Six months later, my husband got a good job and forced me to return to his house. He had promised to move to a separate house with me but did not do so, stated Pallavi in an FIR filed with Kasba police on June 3, 2009.        
	She also claimed that her husband had taken away her jewellery and abandoned her and the child and shifted to a flat with his parents in June.        
	The court has so far directed at least 50 warring couples to resolve their differences by staying together.

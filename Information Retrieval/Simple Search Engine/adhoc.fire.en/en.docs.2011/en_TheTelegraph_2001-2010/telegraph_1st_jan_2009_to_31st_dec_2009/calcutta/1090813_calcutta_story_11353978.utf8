The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Centres exempt from order
                                                                                                               Centres exempt from order
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Eighteen computer training centres have been exempted from the temporary closure order the high court had issued for around 800 such institutions facilitated by the youth welfare department.        
	The division bench headed by Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar selectively stayed the closure order, passed by Justice Sanjib Banerjee, following a plea by Bagnan Youth Computer Training Center and 17 other institutions.         
	The division bench also ruled that the petitioners be made a party to the case pending before Justice Banerjee, who had ordered the centres to close down for a fortnight after a state lawyer submitted that the youth welfare department had selected them without publishing advertisements.        
	On Wednesday, however, additional state pleader Sandip Srimani stated that the centres were allowed to open after verification by officials.

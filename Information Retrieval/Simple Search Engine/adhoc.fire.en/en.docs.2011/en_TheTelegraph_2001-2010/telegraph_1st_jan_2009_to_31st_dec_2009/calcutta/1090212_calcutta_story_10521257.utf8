          SOUMITRA DAS                          Hemant Rao and Rahul B. Wagh from Bhopal at the opening of their exhibition titled Mindscape at Studio 21 on Wednesday evening. Picture by Pradip Sanyal                                  
	The current exhibition at Studio 21 featuring three young artists from Bhopal comes as a refreshing change from the repetitive work that we see in most galleries in Calcutta these days.        
	These works are unpretentious and simple and not weighed down either by theories or over-ambitious plans difficult to execute. In this exhibition titled Mindscape, that opened on Wednesday evening, the three artists  Rahul B. Wagh, Hemant Rao and Harish Ojha  seemed to be representing states of the mind with the minimum of fuss. All three were trained at Bharat Bhavan, and the first two were present at the opening.        
	Rahul B. Waghs paintings and drawings effortlessly shift from the abstract to the representational, but are more aligned to the former. His watercolours inspired by textiles are chequered in the manner of gamchha executed with confident strokes of maroon and blue. Thin wavy lines of blue and green, or stripes of orange and red are spread across the length and breadth of yet other works.        
	The most intriguing ones are the bursts of green, black, orange, ochre and red, shades apparently applied in an arbitrary fashion, but often resembling the fanciful shapes of clouds. Wagh has added tiny line drawings in these, the more elaborate versions of which we see in his combos of biological and botanical and even mechanical forms.        
	These works on paper are splashed with red or yellow along with fine pen-and-ink drawings of enigmatic intent. This young artists works can set off a train of thoughts way beyond their actual contents.        
	Hemant Rao aims high but his ideas could have been better realised. He says he wants to create meditative forms, but the strata of browns like formations of cumulus with white paint sprayed across both sides of the frame and confetti-like strokes floating in the space is a trifle too hard-edged and prosy. One misses the tranquillity of meditation.        
	Viewing Harish Ojhas series entitled Folk Culture is a more rewarding experience. The title suggests colour, and colourful they are, but in a highly restrained manner. These are drawings done on large white sheets of paper with bright-hued suggestions  but only suggestions  of folk toys and dancers.         
	The splotches of red and yellow do create a mood of festivity and merriment, but thankfully not the same effect as promotional material for Incredible India.

                      Creative visualisations                    Though he won worldwide acclaim as a filmmaker, Satyajit Ray was much more than a maker of films. Ray was also an author, essayist, editor of a magazine for children, lyricist, music composer, typographer and artist. And last but not the least, he was a consummate photographer whose output of still photographs was as large and impressive as it was rich in its variety. As part of Ray Today, the festival on Satyajit Ray being hosted to mark his 88th birth anniversary, Birla Academy of Art amp; Culture and Satyajit Ray Society host Rayimages, the ongoing show of artworks and photographs by the versatile genius. Featuring works that form a significant part of the Societys archive, it highlights a fascinating though often neglected aspect of Rays immeasurable talent. On display are posters from Ray classics including Pather Panchali, Apur Sansar, Chiriakhana, Sonar Kella and Nayak, music notations, logo designs, set designs, floor-plans, shot-division sketches and make-up sketches of his films characters, as well as candid photographs of film personalities and of places in India and around the world.

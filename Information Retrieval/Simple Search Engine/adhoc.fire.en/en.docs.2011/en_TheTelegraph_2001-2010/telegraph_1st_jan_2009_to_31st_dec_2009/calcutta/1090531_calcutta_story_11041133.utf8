	Apropos Notes from the brink, May 3, was it really necessary to chronicle the life of a brat  a school dropout, a suicidal psycho, an impulsive wedder, a below-poverty-line sugar daddy and a failed litterateur rolled into one? Impulsive marriages, especially with younger women, often come costly in terms of money and humiliation. Ask Sir Paul. Globally, it is a trend to blame women for any marital glitch.             
	In the David Beckham-Rebecca Loos case of September 2003 the British media and public opinion blamed wife Victoria for selfishly pursuing her career and not going to live in Spain when her husband went to play for Real Madrid from Manchester United.           
	It is sad that Metro is also pinning blame on the woman for the suicide. Dipaks wife committed no cardinal sin by sending a divorce notice. She only asserted her individual liberty. It is really tough to live with such a man. Professionally successful women often dump their teentime crushes as they are incompatible with their new lifestyles. Ash, Sush, Lara and Frieda are living testimonies.

	The report Golf Greener, April 5, was very interesting. It was heartening to note that the promising Tutul Ali is being supported by Bhalotia. A glance at Tutuls photograph gives an impression that he is grossly underweight and undernourished.             
	A.S. Mehta,           
	New Alipore                               
	The report Fortune feathers March 15, was a revelation. The cost of a pair of hyacinth macaws at Rs 18 lakh is staggering. Apart from the legal angle, keeping winged beauties in captivity is insensitive.             
	Shipra Chakraborty,

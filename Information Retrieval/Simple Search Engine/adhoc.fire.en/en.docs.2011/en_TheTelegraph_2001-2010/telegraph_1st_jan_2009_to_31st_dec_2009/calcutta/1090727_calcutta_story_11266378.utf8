The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Blast from terror past
                                                                                                               Blast from terror past
  - Al-Badr link in Kashmir arrest shatters city girls home           IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                                    
	A Calcutta girl married to a man she fell in love with at a traffic signal five years ago is at the crossroads after learning that her husband is an alleged Pakistani terrorist wanted for crimes in Kashmir.         
	Teenager Tehrunisa was on her way to school in the spring of 2004 when she first met the young, strapping Junaid Alam Sheikh at the Rashbehari crossing. It was, she recalls, love at first sight for both of them.        
	A year-long courtship, four years of marriage and two children later, Tehrunisa  now 23  is struggling to come to terms with her husbands alleged past. Jammu and Kashmir police, who arrested 39-year-old Junaid last month during a trip to the Valley, insist that Tehrunisas husband used to lead the militant organisation Al-Badrs operations in Kupwara in the late 1990s.        
	Junaid, who first came to Calcutta in 2000 hoping to enter Bangladesh from Bengal and then head home, changed his plan after spending a couple of days in the city.         
	Posing as a migrant from Kashmir, he drove a taxi for two years before finding a permanent job as an ambulance driver at MR Bangur Hospital.        
	Nobody Junaid knew in the city had a clue about his alleged past, and he didnt mention it to anybody. He and Tehrunisa led a normal life with their two children Rehan, 3, and one-and-a-half-year-old Nasreen until luck ran out for him last month, Musaddiq Abbas, the officer-in-charge of Kupwara police station, told Metro over phone.         
	Junaid had left the city for Kashmir along with Tehrunisa and their daughter on June 23 to meet a friend who owed him money. The friend passed on the information to the police, who arrested Junaid the day he reached Kupwara.         
	I was too stunned to react when the police told me that my husband was a Pakistani national and a terrorist.... We were so happy together, Tehrunisa said over phone from Kupwara police station.         
	Her mother Panchi Bewa, 57, said nothing in Junaids demeanour ever suggested that he was capable of violence. Khwab mein bhi nahin socha tha ke woh terrorist hai. Meri ladki ka zindagi barbad ho gaya (I could not have imagined he was a terrorist, even in my my wildest dreams. My daughters life has been ruined), she cried, holding Rehan close.        
	Kashmir police have said they will escort Tehrunisa and her daughter to the city soon.         
	She is innocent. Junaid never disclosed his real identity to her. We will reunite Tehrunisa and her daughter with their family in Calcutta, said officer Abbas.

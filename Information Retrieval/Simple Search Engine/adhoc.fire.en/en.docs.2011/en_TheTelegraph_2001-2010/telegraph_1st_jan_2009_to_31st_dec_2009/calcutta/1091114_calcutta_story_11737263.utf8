                                                                            Saturday , November 14 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Death on Metro track
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 25-year-old man unhappy about his career and undergoing counselling to cure depression jumped to his death on a Metro track on Friday morning.         
	Medical representative and microbiology postgraduate Arnab Mukherjee parked his motorcycle in front of Rabindra Sarobar station a little after 9.30am, bought a ticket and spent his last moments on the platform waiting for a train to arrive. He jumped in front of a Kavi Nazrul-bound train at 9.58pm, police said.        
	The train driver slammed the emergency brakes but couldnt save Arnab from becoming the second Metro suicide casualty in a week and the seventh person to die on the tracks this year. All south-bound trains were detained at various stations for half an hour but those headed north were not disrupted.        
	Arnabs family and friends knew that he was unhappy with his job but never suspected that depression would drive him to suicide.        
	His heart was in research but he wasnt getting the right opportunities since completing his post-graduation from Bangalore. We knew that his job was draining him but didnt think it would come to this, said father Jishukesh, who works in a private company.        
	A police officer said Arnab had taken a bank loan to start a business before becoming a medical representative.        
	According to a relative, Arnab was undergoing counselling in a city-based mental health clinic over the past month.         
	Mother Deboshree, a schoolteacher, last spoke to him over phone around 9.15am. I called him from school to ask him to bring a gift for his brother (who is in Class IX) for doing well in his exams. He was unusually quiet over the past couple of weeks but I had no inkling of what was in his mind even when I spoke to him last, she said.        
	Arnab left his two-storeyed family home on Shyam Bose Road, Chetla, around 9.20am and apparently rode his bike straight to Rabindra Sarobar station. Cops found the two-wheeler with Arnabs helmet dangling from the steering handle.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Three held for Internet bank fraud
                                                                                                               Three held for Internet bank fraud
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Three youths were arrested on Monday for allegedly siphoning off Rs 42 lakh from individual accounts in a private bank after making them Internet banking enabled.         
	According to police, Rajjak Ali, Suman Ganguly and Subhrodev Saha Choudhury obtained names and phone numbers of some customers of the bank.        
	Posing as bank officials, the conmen called up the customers and offered to upgrade their account free after they answered questions to verify their identity. On this ruse, the three obtained the dates of birth and other personal details of the customers, said an investigator.        
	The trio simultaneously floated an agency promising fast processing of loans. They collected two photographs, a photocopy of a PAN card and a debit card with zero balance from their clients. High-value transactions had to be shown on the card for the loans to be sanctioned, claimed the youths.        
	The trio used the photographs and the PAN card photocopy to purchase SIM cards. The conmen then called up the banks helpline posing as customers whose particulars they had collected and requested that their contact numbers be changed to the new numbers, said an officer.        
	A few days later, they again called the helpline posing as customers, this time to request that netbanking be activated for their accounts and the password texted to their mobile phones, added the officer.        
	After receiving the passwords, the three allegedly visited cyber cafes and transferred hefty sums through netbanking to accounts whose debit cards they had earlier collected.        
	The conmen then withdrew the money from ATMs at various spots in several installments. Nine clients of the bank were cheated and the gang had targeted several others, said an officer.        
	Ali was arrested in Chinsurah, Ganguly in Garfa and Saha Choudhury in Chandernagore on Monday.        
	Saha Choudhury is a former employee of the bank, who had been arrested in connection with another fraud case.        
	The cops started a probe following the banks complaint in March stating that over Rs 4 lakh had gone missing from an account, said detective chief Jawed Shamim.        
	The cops arrested the owner of one of the accounts where money was transferred. He pleaded ignorance and told the police that he had given his debit card to some youths for processing a loan.         
	Months of investigation by Soumya Banerjee, Nil Kantha Roy and Mriganka Mohan Das led to the arrests.

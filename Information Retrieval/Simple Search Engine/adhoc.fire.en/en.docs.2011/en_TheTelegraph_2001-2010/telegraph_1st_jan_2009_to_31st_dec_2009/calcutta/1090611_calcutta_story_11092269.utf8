          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	A middle-aged man claiming to be a state home department employee close to the chief minister barged into a high court bar association room on Wednesday afternoon and allegedly abused lawyers sitting inside.        
	Dulal Banerjee was arrested on the basis of a complaint lodged by the lawyers at Hare Street police station. Later, Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar  acting on a joint plea by the lawyers  passed an administrative order asking police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti to come to his chamber and state what action had been taken against the accused.        
	According to the complaint, Banerjee entered bar association room No. 15 and started abusing a lawyer representing him for not taking initiative to dispose of the case quickly. When other lawyers objected to Banerjees language, he allegedly started abusing lawyers in general.        
	The man threatened to put us behind bar on the charge of harassing common litigants, said one of the 50 advocates who were in the room.

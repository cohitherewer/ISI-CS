	The first Norwester of the season hit the city on Monday afternoon, accompanied by hailstorm on the eastern fringes.        
	The Norwester, which was not very strong, was caused by a local development of clouds, said D.N. Talapatra, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.         
	According to Met officials, hot air rises at this time of the year forming cyclonic circulation over western Bengal and Jharkhand. Simultaneously, an anti-cyclonic circulation forms over the Bengal coast, drawing in moisture from the Bay of Bengal leading to the development of thunderclouds.        
	Thunderstorms take place when hot air and moist air come in contact. The rain is often accompanied by hail, said a Met official.         
	The condition is favourable for Norwesters in Bankura, Purulia and Burdwan, where tall columns of thunderclouds have formed, added the official.

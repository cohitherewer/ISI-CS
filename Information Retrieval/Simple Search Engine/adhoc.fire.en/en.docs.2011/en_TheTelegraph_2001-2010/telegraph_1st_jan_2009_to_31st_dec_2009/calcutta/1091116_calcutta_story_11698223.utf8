                                                                            Monday , November 16 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Poll-eve civic scheme for minority wards
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                                        In the pipeline  200 tubewells  3000 low-cost houses  100 schools  Free textbooks  100 community toilets  Mobile medical vans  Job-linked training for 2,000 youths  Credit societies      
	The Left Front-ruled Calcutta Municipal Corporation has finalised a Rs 81-crore package for minorities which sources said had been drawn up with an eye on the civic polls barely six months away.        
	The scheme will be implemented in 37 wards across the city that have been identified as minority wards. All nine wards (133-141) in Garden Reach and one in Jadavpur (111, comprising Kamdahari and Brahmapur) have been included in the list. The remaining 27 wards are in east and central Calcutta.        
	Insiders said this was the first ever minorities-only development initiative taken up by the civic body.        
	We will put greater emphasis on the development of minorities through our Multi-sectoral Development Plan. The Centre will give Rs 21 crore and we will cough up Rs 60 crore, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said. The deadline for the completion of the projects is 2012.        
	Municipal commissioner Arnab Roy said the focus of the development initiative would be on education, employment, healthcare and infrastructure.        
	Under the education initiative, the CMC has decided to set up 100 schools, add two additional rooms to the existing 25 civic schools for holding Urdu classes, recruit 100 Urdu and Hindi teachers and distribute textbooks free.        
	The health schemes would involve deployment of 10 mobile medical vans, construction of 100 community toilets and setting up of 15 ward health units.        
	To boost employment, the CMC will provide vocational training to 2,000 youths, set up credit societies which will offer soft loans and distribute tool kits to artisans.        
	Under the infrastructure head, 200 tubewells will be sunk, 3,000 low-cost houses built and sewers upgraded.        
	Joint municipal commissioner Sahidul Islam said Rs 62.1 crore would be spent on healthcare and infrastructure, and Rs 5.85 crore on education.        
	Civic officials said the wards where at least 30 per cent of the below-poverty-lines families were minorities had been declared as minority wards.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A decorative brass trident has gone missing from Swami Vivekanandas ancestral house, three weeks after two similar pieces were stolen from the north Calcutta address.        
	The theft came to light on Sunday morning when a monk went to the first-floor verandah of the house where the tridents, each weighing 2.5kg, were screwed onto wooden posts in a railing.        
	The railing had 15 such tridents of which two were stolen on October 23. The remaining 13 were in place when monks had checked the spot on Saturday night.        
	The police suspect the thieves  probably drug addicts  entered the building the same way as the last time: by scaling the compounds boundary wall and climbing up a pillar to the first floor.        
	The theft has punched holes in the police claim that vigil around the landmark building  renamed Ramakrishna Mission Swami Vivekanandas Ancestral House and Cultural Centre after being taken over by the Belur Math-headquartered order  had been stepped up after the theft of two tridents.        
	Faiyaaz Ahmed, the officer-in-charge of Girish Park police station, said: There was no round-the-clock deployment as the centre had its own guards but we had intensified patrolling on the roads around the building following the October theft.        
	An officer of the detective department said the Mission authorities should install closed-circuit TV cameras in the building as it housed priceless memorabilia associated with Swamijis life.        
	The detective department has prepared a list of local criminals who are on the run or out on bail. We are sure the thieves will sell the trident and buy drugs with the money. The brass items do not have any antique value and will not fetch much money, said an officer of the burglary section at Lalbazar.        
	Swami Shivamayananda, the secretary of the centre, expressed surprise over the theft as the authorities had stepped up internal vigil after last months incident.        
	Two monks were asked to inspect the spot where the tridents are installed twice every night. Besides, we have our own guards who are posted at the gates. How could the thieves still enter? wondered Swami Shivamayananda.        
	The centre, unveiled in September 2004, houses a shrine, meditation hall, museum, textbook library, research centre and a centre for rural and slum development.

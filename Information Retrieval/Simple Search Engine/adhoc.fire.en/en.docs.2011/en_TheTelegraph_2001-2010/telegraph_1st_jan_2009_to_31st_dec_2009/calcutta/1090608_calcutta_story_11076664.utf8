The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Jewellers shut shop for 72 hours
                                                                                                               Jewellers shut shop for 72 hours
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Plan to do some last-minute jewellery shopping this week for the weekend wedding in the family? Dont.        
	Forty thousand jewellers in the state are going on strike from Monday to Wednesday, stopping the making, booking and buying of jewellery  bang in the middle of wedding season.        
	Members of the Swarna Shilpa Bachao Committee and Bangiyo Swarna Shilpi Samity have announced the 72-hour bandh to protest the high-handedness of the income tax department.        
	A total of one crore jewellers and kaarigars are participating in the bandh and all jewellery stores across the state will be shut, said Bablu De, the working president of the Swarna Shilpa Bachao Committee.        
	How hard will it hit the consumer? You can neither book jewellery nor buy jewellery. Those who have pre-booked their jewellery will also not get their delivery till we re-open shops on Thursday morning, said De.        
	The bandh call comes in the wake of raids by income-tax officials. They have been entering stores and harassing jewellers. Some are picking on American diamonds (a semi-precious white stone) and slapping a fine demanding their valuation as diamonds. Others are taking jewellery made of gold alloys to be pure gold and resorting to threats, claimed De.        
	Some jewellers claimed that they were confined for hours and even made to sign blank papers.        
	The income tax department refused comment but a former IT official, on condition of anonymity, defended the current survey on jewellery shops.        
	Such stocktaking is essential; it includes weighing, valuing and verifying with the account books. This often takes a long time and for some this might seem like torture, but that does not mean that the exercise can be stopped, as many jewellers often indulge in wrongdoing, he said.        
	The three-day strike will result in a daily loss of revenue of Rs 50-60 crore, said De, but the jewellery brands had been left with no choice.        
	Wedding shoppers will also find themselves left with little choice this week. The wedding season is on till July 3, and Calcutta is the hub of traditional jewellery in bridal shopping, so those getting married or attending weddings in June-July will be hit, said wedding planner Vinod Bhandari.

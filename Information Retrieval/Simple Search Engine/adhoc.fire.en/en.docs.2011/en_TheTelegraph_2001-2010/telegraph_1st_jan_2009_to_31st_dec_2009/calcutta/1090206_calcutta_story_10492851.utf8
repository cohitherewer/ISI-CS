                                                                                                               Key suspect untraced
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The Howrah police team that went to Bihar on Monday in search of Santosh Singh  the alleged mastermind in the abduction and murder of the Yash Lakhotia  returned empty-handed on Thursday.        
	Our officers, accompanied by Samastipur police, stayed in Santoshs village for two days but could not trace him, said an officer.        
	An official in the home department said the director-general of police was unhappy with the slow progress in the case. The seven-year-old went missing on January 29 and was found dead two days later but the police are still in the dark about the motive, the official said.        
	The CID had studied call details of Santosh and the Lakhotias but no conclusive leads have emerged, said a CID sleuth.

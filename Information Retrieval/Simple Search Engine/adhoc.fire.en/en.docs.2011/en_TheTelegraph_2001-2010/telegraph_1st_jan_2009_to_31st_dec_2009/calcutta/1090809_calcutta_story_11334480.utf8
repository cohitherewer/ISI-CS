The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Different causes on different days
                                                                                                               Different causes on different days

	Subhas Chakraborty was not a great supporter of environment. Rather the maverick transport minister, who died on Monday, was its opposite, and a favourite punching bag for scribes writing on environment. Even his ardent supporters  there are many  cannot deny Chakrabortys role in creating the mess on the roads since July 31, the court-ordered deadline for the withdrawal of polluting old commercial vehicles and autorickshaws.         
	It is ironic that in his last public appearance he ran into trouble with a section of transport operators he tried to protect throughout the better part of his ministerial life. Many believe that the fiasco was responsible for his quick physical deterioration thereafter.         
	This highlights the difficulty of being the transport minister and a leader of transport unions simultaneously.         
	If it did not affect his political constituency, Chakraborty was game for propagating right causes; even the environment. The event that immediately comes into mind is the Calcutta-Melbourne tram festival in 2001. Chakraborty did not only give a tram free of cost for carrying out the festival, but also flagged off the event. On his request Usha Uthup boarded the tram and sang the virtues of the eco-friendly mode of transport for about couple of hours non-stop, and the minister accompanied her, all smiles! He felicitated the tram activists from Australia and even wore a tram publicity T-shirt with lungs printed on it.         
	I believe trams are a fantastic mode of transport and eco-friendly. I want to assure all tram lovers that these cars, which are the integral part of the heritage of Calcutta, will not be phased out, Chakraborty was quoted as saying in The Telegraph in March 2001 immediately after the tramjatra.         
	However, the opposite of what he promised happened over time as the trams have been pushed systematically towards a slow death by his departments step-motherly attitude. Do we smell the diesel lobby here?         
	He took a similar U-turn on countering pollution from old transport vehicles and autos. I had seen him endorsing the view of environment department in a closed-door meeting on vehicular pollution in the rotunda of Writers Buildings, even questioning why Calcutta would stay polluted when other cities have been cleaned up, only to complain a few days later to the chief minister against the environment department when it brought out the notification to ban 15-year-old commercial vehicles.         
	The notification was converted into an order by a division bench of the high court. A man can wear many hats. Chakraborty definitely wore more than one.                     JAYANTA BASU

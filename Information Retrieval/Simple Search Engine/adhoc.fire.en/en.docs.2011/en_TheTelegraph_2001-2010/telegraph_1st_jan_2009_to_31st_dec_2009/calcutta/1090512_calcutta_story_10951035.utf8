                                                                                                               Rain relief in swelter city
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Mamata Banerjees prayers for rain relief were answered on Monday evening with the city being lashed by the seasons second Norwester and the weatherman holding out hope for more on poll eve.        
	Its so hot Unbearable Would be great if it rains today, Mamata had said on Sunday evening.        
	Twenty-four hours later, the Norwester, with windspeeds of 50-60km per hour, struck between 6.12pm and 6.15pm. It sent the city scurrying for cover, but with a smile of relief.        
	The shower that followed the storm lasted over an hour and brought the temperatures down from around 34 degree Celsius just before the shower to around 29 degree Celsius.        
	G.C. Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore, said: The low pressure trough over Bihar and Orissa, along with a cyclonic formation over north Bengal, made conditions favourable for rain.        
	Theres more to come, assured the weatherman. Over the next 24 hours, Calcutta and other parts of south Bengal would receive widespread rainfall, hail, thundershowers and Norwesters. The high incursion of moisture in the lower troposphere from the Bay of Bengal and the trough of low pressure over Bihar, Orissa and parts of south Bengal would bring relief. Wednesday should be quite pleasant for voters in and around Calcutta.        
	Flights and suburban trains were disrupted but the gutsy winds marked the end of a five-day swelter that saw the maximum temperature crossing 42 degree Celsius and the maximum relative humidity soaring into the 90s.        
	Two Calcutta-bound flights had to be diverted to Bhubaneswar. A Kingfisher flight from Bagdogra and JetLites Vizag-Calcutta flight were diverted. Flight departures and arrivals were delayed. Train services on various routes were hit from 6.15pm to 6.45 pm.

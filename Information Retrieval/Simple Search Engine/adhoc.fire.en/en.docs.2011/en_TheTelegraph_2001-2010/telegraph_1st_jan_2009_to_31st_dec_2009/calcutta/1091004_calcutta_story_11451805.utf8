The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Lobby of lost youth
                                                                                                               Lobby of lost youth
										      Free radical                        The newest entrance to The Park				                                 
	I have been robbed of a chunk of my youth and I want to complain, bitterly. It all began mdash; or should I say ended mdash; on one fine Sunday evening when I was sitting home minding my own business and some friends suggested a night out. ldquo;C u at 9pm, Park lobby rdquo;: the text messages did the rounds of Calcutta.  
	The meeting was a disaster.   
	I turned up at Park Street at 8.50  one of those rare occasions when the Calcutta traffic didnt get the better of me  and breezed into The Park hotel alley that leads to the lobby. As I walked the stretch, something seemed amiss. Its the new cafe outside Roxy, I told myself. In hindsight, I know it was my subconscious trying to warn me of the impending doom.         
	The glass doors looked different, ominously so. I pushed them open, my feet ready for the flight of wooden steps that would take me to the well of the lobby, keeping Someplace Else on my left and a pair of sensuously comfortable couches on my right. But there were no steps; I encountered a wall in front of me. I looked around dazed, wondering if I had landed up at the right place. But a sign on the wall said Someplace Else. I relaxed a bit. May be theyve relocated the entrance, I consoled myself. Lobby kidhar hai, I asked a parking valet. Andar chaley jaaiye madam, he pointed right.         
	A little ahead, I emerged into a small, circular space, done up in steel and mauve  very Dil Chahta Hai. As I stood rooted to the spot, reality slowly sunk in  they had redecorated the Park lobby. Heck no, they had desecrated my Park lobby.         
	The new lobby was chic and plush. Some would call its decor tasteful. I hated it.         
	I stormed out and waited on the road. When my friends arrived, I shook my head, rolled my eyes and wrung my hands.         
	Some of them, thankfully, shared my agony. One of them had brought along a cousin from Delhi and she was stunned by our hysteria. But whats wrong with this lobby? she wanted to know.         
	As I sipped my drink at The Atrium cafe, I tried to tell her what the Park lobby is, rather was, all about. It was large and welcoming and had space and time for you even if you didnt have the money to spend at the hotel.         
	This was the place my friends and I had met for our first night out and I still remember the heady feeling as we assembled at the lobby before entering Someplace Else, some nine years back. This was the place where my friends boyfriend had to carry her home from after her first tryst with tequila. This was the place where a woman chatted up my husbands friend and gave him her number  a story that we have heard countless times and Im sure will hear again with as much gusto as the first narration. This was the place where you were bound to meet a known face whatever time of the day or night you arrived. This was the place where you sat and waited as your friend changed from jeans and T-shirt to a halter neck dress in the loo. Long before we were able to afford the luxuries of the hotel, Meet you at the Park lobby became a part of our lexicon much like beefsteak at Olypub or chelo kabab at Peter Cat.         
	The renovation of The Park has demolished another part of our youth, the ground floor restrooms. This was where the girls would gather and talk about the boys in the group (I have a feeling the boys did the same in the mens room).         
	And one would invariably bump into long-lost classmates there, an impossibility in the crowded pub. Make-up and gossip would be shared, and promises made to catch up later. Now, there is no restroom on the ground floor and one has to hike to the first floor to answer the call of nature or fashion.         
	For the new crop of youngsters, the chic lobby will possibly evoke similar emotions as the years go by, but for my gang and me, its the end of an era.

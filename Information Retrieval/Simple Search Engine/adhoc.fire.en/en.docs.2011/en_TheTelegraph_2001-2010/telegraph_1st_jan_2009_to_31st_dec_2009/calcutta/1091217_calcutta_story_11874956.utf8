The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rule of rogue on the road   Auto driver punches woman passenger
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Auto driver punches woman passenger
          OUR BUREAU                          Puja Manhot in hospital. (Pradip Sanyal)                                        
	A young woman trying to protect her dignity was proclaimed a pagol (lunatic) and punched in the face by an autorickshaw driver on Wednesday, highlighting once again the rule of the rogue on the streets of Calcutta.        
	Puja Manhot, 30, ended up at Medical College and Hospital with bleeding lips for daring to question what most women silently face every day  unwanted male attention and brusque behaviour.        
	A resident of BB-50 in Salt Lake, Puja had boarded an auto at Girish Park to go to Kankurgachhi around 5.40pm. When the auto stopped near the Gangurams outlet to pick up an elderly passenger, the 30-year-old got off so that he could take the middle seat.        
	I was standing when a passing cyclist almost grazed me, at which I asked him whether he couldnt see me. The man replied: Kuch hua to nahin (Has anything happened?)? Before I could say anything more, the auto driver remarked: Pagol aachhe (Shes mad), Puja told Metro.        
	Not one to take a disparaging remark lying down, Puja turned to the auto driver, Suman Dey, and questioned: Main pagal dikhti hoon kya? (Do I look mad?).        
	Dey allegedly became so furious on seeing her grab the rear-view mirror of the auto while talking to him that he punched her on the face. As a crowd gathered around the bleeding Puja, Suman left his auto by the roadside and took shelter at a police kiosk.         
	The crowd followed him and demanded that the cops hand over the auto driver to them. When they refused to do so, some people smashed the glass pane of the kiosk, a witness said.        
	A police team arrived a little later to take Puja and Suman to Amherst Street police station, from where she was sent to Medical College and Hospital for a check-up. Based on Pujas complaint, driver Suman was arrested later in the evening.        
	Puja, pursuing an art and crafts course since being estranged from her husband, said the first thought that came to her mind after being hit by Suman was that she must not let him get away with it.        
	How can the police let such things happen on Calcutta streets? He hit me just because I stood up to his verbal abuse. It could have been anybody else. I do not want to sit there crying. I want to see him arrested, fumed Puja, in the emergency ward of the hospital with her blood-smeared dupatta covering her lips.         
	Suman, a 30-year-old resident of Narkeldanga Main Road, accused Puja of extreme provocation.

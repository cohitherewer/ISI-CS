	A newly married woman committed suicide by hanging herself in her parents house in Beniapukur on Sunday.         
	A preliminary probe suggested Roshni Jahan, 20, who married a month ago, killed herself because of dowry demands. Police are looking for her husband and in-laws, who are absconding.        
	Roshnis family lodged a complaint accusing her in-laws of torturing her and abetting her suicide. Roshni came to her parents home from her in-laws house in the same neighbourhoold on Saturday night.

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Sujit Sarkar, a retired director- general of police, was sworn in on Thursday as the states first information commissioner amid allegations of irregularities, four years after the Right to Information (RTI) Act was passed.         
	According to the act, a state must have at least two information commissioners. Since December 2005, Bengal has had only a chief information commissioner.        
	The leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, Partha Chatterjee, said he had been kept in the dark about Sarkars appointment as information commissioner.        
	The RTI Act makes it mandatory for the appointment to be cleared by a three-member committee, chaired by the chief minister and comprising a cabinet minister nominated by him and the leader of the Opposition.        
	The appointment of Sujit Sarkar has been approved by the chief minister and industries minister Nirupam Sen, said an official of the personnel and administrative reforms department.         
	RTI activists criticised the governments role in enforcing the act. There must be at least one more information commissioner. But then the state has been violating the law from the time the commission was formed in December 2005 and became functional in August 2006, said S. Khettry, the president of RTI Forum, the only registered body in the city to champion the cause of the act.        
	Sarkar said he could comment on the commissions performance only after getting acquainted with its functioning.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Four-hour torment   for fliers
                                                                                                               Four-hour torment   for fliers
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	The 27 passengers on a SpiceJet flight from Bangalore to Guwahati via Calcutta were forced to get off the plane at the city airport without being told why and made to wait for four hours on Thursday.        
	The flight took off from Bangalore around 9.15am and landed at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport around noon.        
	Passengers are usually asked to remain seated while others board the plane at Calcutta airport. But we were asked to disembark. We had to wait for hours without the airline saying why, said Abdul Majid, a Bangalore-based contractor. The flight usually halts about half an hour in Calcutta.        
	The passengers lodged a complaint against the airline with the city airport authorities. SpiceJet officials later said the delay was because of operational reasons.        
	The passengers had to wait for three hours and despite being a low-cost carrier we arranged for their lunch at the airport, said a SpiceJet official.        
	Calcutta airport sources said the airline had to operate the aircraft in another sector. So they were replacing the bigger aircraft with a smaller one which led to the delay.         
	The flight finally took off around 4pm.

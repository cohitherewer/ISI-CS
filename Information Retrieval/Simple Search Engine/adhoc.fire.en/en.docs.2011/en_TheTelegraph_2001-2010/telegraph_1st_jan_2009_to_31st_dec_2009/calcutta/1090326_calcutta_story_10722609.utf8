The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mall at wrong place at wrong time
                                                                                                               Mall at wrong place at wrong time
          POULOMI BANERJEE AND PRIYANKA ROY                                             
	Mani Square is haemorrhaging and there is no coagulant in sight. Poor footfall and pathetic conversions have made this 710,000sq ft mall the largest symbol of how big means bleeding in todays retail lexicon.        
	But why is Mani Square taking such a hit? A combination of last mover disadvantage (after Forum, City Centre and South City Mall), poor timing (the economic meltdown) and its neither-here-nor-there location.        
	Mani Square is not alone in not achieving the targets that were set when the mall was launched. The trend is seen all over the world. At a time when shoppers and spenders have become hardcore savers, what better can one expect, argued Sanjay Jhunjhunwala, the CEO of the Mani Group.        
	At the time of its opening, in July 2008, then COO Lou Armstrong had grandly announced that there was scope for 10 such malls in the city.        
	Now, the first of those projected 10 is struggling to stay afloat. Retailers are desperately seeking crutches for the blows they are taking, week after week. Several stores are on sale in the desperation to bridge the rent versus revenue gap.         
	The rent is very high, Rs 125-175 per square feet. The mall was marketed and the rates decided at a time when the mall business was booming. But now, when business has gone bust, it is too much to pay. The rates are lower at the other malls, Rs 80-120 at South City and Rs 90-95 at City Centre, said a retailer who has stores in Forum, South City and Mani Square. Business is better at South City than at Mani Square, he added.        
	The mall authorities claimed they were trying to change things. We have introduced a number of stimulus packages addressing the monthly outgoing commitments of the retailers. New tenants are coming in. We have received a lot of enquiries as people are exploring possibilities to enter or expand in these times to ensure that they get a good deal, said Jhunjhunwala.        
	The four-screen IMAX-Cinemax multiplex has also failed to do the trick for a footfall-parched mall. The curtains went up in January, but the presence of the first 3D IMAX technology in town hasnt managed to push up occupancy figures beyond the 20 percent mark in recent weeks, say sources.        
	We are doing average business in a poorly performing market, said operations head Debamita Nag Banerjee. Cinemax blamed the Mani Square location (we are neither in the city nor in Salt Lake proper) for the poor footfalls.        
	A leading film distributor in town put figures to the flop show. Both Cinemax and IMAX are struggling to get people in. Their weekly occupancies are in the range of 2,000-2,500, something that most other plexes are managing in a single day.        
	With hardly any takers for 3D documentary-styled offerings, any show at IMAX is now available at Rs 95, a drastic comedown from the Rs 250-300 it commanded at its opening.        
	The food court is better off than the film space, but barely so. Calcutta Roll Co. the Bengali cuisine outlet has left. So has an Indian and tandoori speciality outlet. Jhunjhunwala refused to admit that has left a bad taste in the mouth.         
	Food courts are meant to be dynamic, with unpopular outlets making way for new ones, he shrugged. But he added: The F amp;B sector is not as badly hit as, say, the fashion sector but all have to work out a survival strategy.        
	That is the mantra for Mani Square, fast being termed the mall at the wrong place at the wrong time.

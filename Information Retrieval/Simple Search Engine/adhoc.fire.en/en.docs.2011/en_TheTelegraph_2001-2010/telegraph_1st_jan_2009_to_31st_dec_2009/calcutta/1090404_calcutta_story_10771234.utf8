                                                                                                               Foreigner held at child shelter 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 35-year-old woman looking for her lost children at a Salt Lake shelter was found to have entered the country illegally and handed over to police.        
	Zohra Begum, a resident of Myanmar, was arrested on Thursday after officials of the childrens home informed the cops that a foreigner without any legal documents had come looking for her children. She was sent to 14 days judicial custody on Friday.        
	According to cops, Zohra reached the Basirhat-Ghojadanga border in early February via Bangladesh along with her seven children.        
	She said she came to India to meet her sister in Jammu, who had promised her a job. She crossed the borders with the help of touts, but got separated from her kids, said an officer. Zohras seven children  six girls and a boy  were found near the border by the BSF and handed over to the Child Welfare Committee in Calcutta. The girls were sent to Sukanya, a home in Salt Lake, and the boy to Kishalay in Barasat.        
	Zohra went to Sukanya on Wednesday night and claimed the six girls  aged between two-and-a-half years and 14 years  were her children and pleaded to take them back. The girls too recognised Zohra. We felt the girls should be returned to the mother, but we could not take a chance, said a committee member.

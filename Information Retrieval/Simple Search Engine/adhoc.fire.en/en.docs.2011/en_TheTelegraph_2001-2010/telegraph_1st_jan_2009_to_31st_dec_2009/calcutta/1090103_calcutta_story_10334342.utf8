          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Friday asked police to submit an affidavit stating details of the security arrangements at educational institutions in the city and the steps the authorities are considering to make them more strong and tight.        
	The police are directed to enquire from the heads of city and suburban schools about the security arrangements on their premises. If security is found to be inadequate in any school, the police will have to help the authorities strengthen it, the vacation division bench of Justice K.J. Sengupta and P. Mondal ruled.        
	The affidavit will have to be submitted by February 2 and the case will come up for hearing before a regular bench headed by Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar.        
	The bench also asked the cops to make the schools aware of the need to upgrade security to tackle emergencies, including terror strikes. The police should go to the institutions with guidelines on avoiding untoward incidents.        
	The order followed a public interest litigation by Yashowant Sinha seeking an order to the state government for steps to overhaul security in schools.        
	Each and every guardian is worried about school security following the Mumbai siege. In many schools, two or three unarmed guards are in charge of the security of thousands of students, Sinha submitted.        
	Petitioners lawyer Subroto Mookherjee said the state and central governments, spending crores upgrading ministers security, were not bothered about students safety.        
	The schools should be provided with armed guards, the lawyer pleaded with the bench.        
	The state lawyer was present but no one represented the Centre.

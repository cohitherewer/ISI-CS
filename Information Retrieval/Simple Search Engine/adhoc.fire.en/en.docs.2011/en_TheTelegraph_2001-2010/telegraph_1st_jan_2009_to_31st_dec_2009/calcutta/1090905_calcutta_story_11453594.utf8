The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Protests shut park
                                                                                                               Protests shut park
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Millennium Park has not opened doors since August 18 because of a Citu protest against alleged unfair practices by private agencies that were in charge of its ticketing.         
	Citu secretary Kali Ghosh said the agency was not paying the labourers according to the government norms.        
	Each time the employees protested, the CMDA (which runs the riverfront park) changed the agency without addressing the issue. That is what we are protesting, added Ghosh.         
	According to sources, the Citu members are also demanding that the 63 people employed by the previous agency be absorbed by the current one, which is yet to take charge.        
	We have had talks with the union. Though the park has been closed to the public till the matter is resolved, maintenance work is going on regularly, said a CMDA official.

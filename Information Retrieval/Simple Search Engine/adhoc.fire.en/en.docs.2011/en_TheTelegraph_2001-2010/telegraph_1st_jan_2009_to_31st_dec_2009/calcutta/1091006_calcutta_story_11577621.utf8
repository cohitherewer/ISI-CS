The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | HC slams parents in salary row 
                                                                                                               HC slams parents in salary row 
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Guardians of school students cannot raise questions on the salaries of teachers, a high court division bench has ruled.        
	Guardians have the right to question the teaching capability of the teachers, their behaviour with students or their involvement in the schools development. But they cannot challenge the legality of the payscale of the teachers, the bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice B. Somadder observed while dismissing an appeal petition moved by the parents of some students of a Howrah school.        
	Slamming the petitioners, the bench said: The move to file such a petition is deeply regretted and deprecated. The court could have imposed cost on the petitioner guardians but is restraining itself from doing so considering their status.        
	The bench also outlined the reason for rejecting the petition, saying the petitioners interests were not in anyway being affected by the salaries. The guardians would have had a case had the school authorities increased the tuition fees to raise money for the teachers salaries.        
	The courts observation followed an appeal by Anita Pattanayek and 16 other guardians of students of Patashpur Gita Rani Dhara Balika Vidyalaya against an order of Justice Arun Mitra of the high court, who had dismissed their petition in 2006.        
	The parents had claimed in their petition that two teachers, Ratna Saha and Sadhana Das, were being illegally paid according to the payscale of postgraduate teachers.        
	The duo have MA and BEd degrees in music but the school does not have the subject in its curriculum. So, Saha and Das are teaching other subjects. The court should ask the state education department to stop paying salaries to the two teachers according to the postgraduate scale, the petitioners lawyer, Sushanta Kundu, had submitted.        
	But Justice Mitra dismissed the petition without making any observation.        
	The petitioners then moved an appeal before the bench of the chief justice and Justice Somadder.        
	When the plea came up for hearing in mid-September, I tabled several judgments by the Supreme Court on similar issues. The apex court had observed that the guardians had the right to question the capability and behaviour of the teachers but cannot interfere in the process of fixing the payscales of the teachers, said L.K. Pal, who appeared for the state.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bus runs over 2 on footpath
                                                                                                               Bus runs over 2 on footpath
          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	A private bus racing another mounted a pavement in the Port area on Thursday morning and mowed down a woman and a priest performing puja.         
	The bus, plying on route 1, was speeding down Circular Garden Reach Road in a bid to overtake the bus in front, which suddenly stopped to pick up passengers.        
	To avoid a collision, the bus on route 1 swerved left and mounted the pavement and rammed into a tea stall where 34-year-old homemaker Kalpana Tant was buying biscuits and milk.        
	After smashing through the tea stall, the bus hit 54-year-old priest Sukhdeb Mishra, who was performing puja at a roadside temple, a few feet from the tea stall.        
	Passengers of the bus said it was racing with the other bus for a long time to pick up passengers. The bus in front stopped suddenly, sparking the accident. Lack of policing on the stretch allows drivers to speed at will, said Sheikh Ikhtiyar Ali, who saw the mishap.         
	Kalpana died on the spot while Mishra was declared dead at BNR Hospital.        
	Kalpana was a resident of BNR Railway Colony while Mishra lived in a room near the temple.         
	The 15-odd passengers on the bus did not sustain injuries but the front of the vehicle was completely smashed, said an officer of West Port police station.        
	The driver and the conductors of the bus are absconding. We are trying to track them down, added the officer.        
	The police have not been able to identify the other bus.

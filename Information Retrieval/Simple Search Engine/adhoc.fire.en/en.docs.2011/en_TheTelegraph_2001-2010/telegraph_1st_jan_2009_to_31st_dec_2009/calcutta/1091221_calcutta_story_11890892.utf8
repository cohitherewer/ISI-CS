                      Christian hymns        Christmas time is a time to celebrate and cherish mo  ments of togetherness with our loved ones. And what   better way to do so than sing or listen to carols on a cold   winter night. Wi-th their lyrics on the theme of Christmas or   the winter season in general, carols are traditionally sung   during and before Christm-as. Carols have most often been   based on medieval chord patterns, and this gives them their   uniquely characteristic musical sound. Though many Christ  mas carols were composed prior to the 20th century, several   have been written in more recent times. Many of todays bet  ter-known modern Christmas carols were written by jazz mu  sician Alfred Burt and are now sung regularly in both sacred   and secular settings. To ring in the spirit of festivity this year,   the Ballygunge Shiksa Sadan Choir goes live this evening   with a repertoire of carols, both traditional and contempo  rary. The choir ensemble conducted by Sumita Bhattacharya begins with the slow carols, Oh holy night, Oh little town of Beth  lehem and A ray of hope. It takes off with the pulsating, fast-paced Jingle Bell rock, the ever-popular Rudolf the red-nosed rein  deer and Christmas Polka, with innovative touches and arrangements by music composer, director Sumit Roy. Music arrange  ment: Errol Vanjour.

	As Mamata Banerjee fast-tracks the implementation of her budget promises to Bengal, an 80-year-old woman selling papad on a south Calcutta pavement is hoping the railway minister would also bring an unfulfilled personal promise back on track.        
	Shefali Ghosh, a regular on the pavement in front of Haldirams at the Exide crossing, had met Mamata for the first time in 2001 to complain about her ailing sons allegedly unfair dismissal from railway service and seek a compensatory job for her grandson.        
	She was then the railway minister of another government (the NDA). She gave me a patient hearing and even wrote to the then divisional railway manager, but the relevant file didnt move because she quit the ministry months later, recalled Shefali.        
	Eight years and several meetings with Mamata later  the latest three months ago  Shefali hasnt lost hope. I quite admire her. I will meet her again.        
	Three generations of Shefalis family have worked for the railways. She had hoped that the baton would pass to grandson Subir after his father Shyam Sundar, a senior commercial clerk with Eastern Railway, took ill and couldnt attend office regularly.        
	Instead of sympathising with us and giving Subir a job, the railways unjustly sacked my son. He died three years ago, and we were literally on the streets, Shefali said, hoping to make Rs 200 for the evening.        
	Subir, 33, now sells papad in railway stations to keep the home fires burning. Mother Tanujas medical expenses are an additional burden.        
	He doesnt have a choice. I am too old now; I dont even have the strength to lift this, said grandmother Shefali, pointing to a faded cloth bag full of papad.        
	So does she intend meeting Mamata again to remind her of the promise? I had gone to meet her at 7am the day after Kali puja but she wasnt home, said the octogenarian.                                
	Shefalis belief that Mamata would solve her problem stems from the fact that the railway minister has always lent me a ear.        
	I even stayed in her Kalighat house when she was not the railway minister. She asked me to stay back that night because it was late and I would have had trouble getting back home, she smiled.        
	According to Shefali, her grandson would have got a job when Mamata recommended him in 2001 had the then divisional railway manager not dismissed Shyam Sundars medical certificates as inconclusive.         
	This is how the bureaucracy works. When my son was diagnosed with tuberculosis in 1993 and became irregular at work, he requested to be considered for the voluntary retirement scheme but to no avail. He was not paid any salary till 2000 and then sacked, said Shefali.        
	Before he died, Shyam Sundar had told his family that he had taken some loans from his office but would still be entitled to around Rs 2 lakh in retirement benefits. We never got that money, Shefali said.

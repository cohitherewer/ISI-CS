The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Girl faces flu test ordeal
                                                                                                               Girl faces flu test ordeal
  - Cough amp; cold lands 7-yr-old in ward of mosquito amp; mess          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A seven-year-old girl became the latest victim of the citys squalid quarantine cell on Tuesday after touching down with a cough and cold.        
	A week ago, a seven-year-old boy arriving from Bangkok with cough and cold had been spared the ordeal of Beleghata ID Hospital and allowed to go home.        
	But Shruti Ghosh, 7, who suffers from bronchitis, was not so lucky while passing through town after a holiday in Australia.        
	The resident of Sohar (220km from Muscat in Oman), with roots in Jamshedpur, was packed off to the Beleghata isolation ward where the swine flu suspect is at the mercy of mosquitoes, with food that cannot be eaten and toilets that cannot be used, till her test results arrive from Delhi.        
	I told the officers of the medical unit at the Calcutta airport that my daughter suffers from chronic bronchitis and thats why she had a cold, but they ignored my pleas to not quarantine her, said Sonali Ghosh, who has been allowed to stay in the hospital ward with Shruti.        
	The ward is a mess and full of mosquitoes. The toilet is just unusable, said the distraught mother, who did not risk the hospital food.        
	An official of ID Hospital confirmed that the mother and daughter had not touched the hospital food. We had given them the regular meal but they kept it under the bed and were allowed food supplied by their relatives.... Many patients tend to do this, admitted the official.        
	Clearly, nothing has changed in Beleghata ID Hospitals isolation ward since a mother and her infant son from Toronto were confined there in end-May on suspicion of being swine-flu carriers.        
	According to airport health officials, the Ghosh family  Sonali, husband Saugata, daughter Shruti and a three-year-old son  was travelling from Australia to Calcutta via Bangkok. The child had mild fever, cough and cold. So we had to refer her to ID Hospital.        
	Shrutis nasal and throat swabs have been sent to the National Institute of Communicable Diseases in Delhi.        
	First they said that the results would be in by Tuesday evening but later they said it would take till Wednesday evening and that we would have to stay here till then, protested Sonali Ghosh. The nurses are nice but the condition of the ward is not, she added.        
	ID Hospital officials said Shrutis temperature had subsided, but she could not be allowed to leave till the H1N1 test results arrived.

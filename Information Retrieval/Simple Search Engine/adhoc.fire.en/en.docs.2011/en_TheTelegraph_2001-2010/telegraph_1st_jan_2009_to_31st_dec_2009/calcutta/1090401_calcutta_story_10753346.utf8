The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Power cuts across city after snag
                                                                                                               Power cuts across city after snag
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                      
	Almost all of south Calcutta, parts of central Calcutta and Salt Lake went without power on Tuesday afternoon after three transformers tripped at the Kasba sub-station of the West Bengal State Electricity Transmission Company Limited.         
	The power cuts ranged from 30 minutes to over two hours, inconveniencing many, especially Higher Secondary and ICSE examinees. The authorities took around two-and-a-half hours to restore the supply across the city in phases.        
	The situation was compounded when two transformers linked to the Kasba substation collapsed, affecting parts of central Calcutta.        
	The power failure, which occurred around 4.20pm, affected many city landmarks, including Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratishthan, Medical College and Hospital, Metro Railway stations and the water works. There was no power at chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees Palm Avenue residence for over 30 minutes. Metro services, however, were not affected.        
	We restored power to the Metro stations within five or six minutes and to Medical College and Hospital in 10 minutes. The supply to the chief ministers residence and the water works were restored by 5pm, said a CESC official.        
	Six Metro stations  Chandni Chowk, Esplanade, Park Street, Maidan, Jatin Das Park and Kalighat  went without power between 4.24pm and 4.28pm.        
	Power department officials said a transformer in Kasba collapsed at 4.20pm because of a snag. The power utility was then supplying about 190MW to south Calcutta and Salt Lake. As soon as one transformer failed, two others also tripped because of overloading, said an official.        
	Engineers restored two transformers around 5pm and another at 7.10pm.         
	Power supply to most parts of the city was restored by 5pm after two transformers were restored. But we received about 160MW from the Kasba substation instead of the usual 220MW, said a CESC official.        
	Power utility chairman Moloy De said even though two other substations  at Rajarhat and Subhasgram  were ready, they couldnt be pressed into service as the transmission lines could not be set up because of resistance by local residents.

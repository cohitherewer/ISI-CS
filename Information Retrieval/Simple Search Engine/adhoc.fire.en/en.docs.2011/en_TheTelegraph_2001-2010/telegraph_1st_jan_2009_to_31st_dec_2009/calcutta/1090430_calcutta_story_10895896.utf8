The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Vacation bell to ring early
                                                                                                               Vacation bell to ring early
  - Schools spare students heat ordeal        MITA MUKHERJEE                                            
	The sweltering summer of 2009 is finally giving children something to cheer about  early holidays!        
	The unrelenting heat, the absence of rain, the frequent power cuts and a city going to the polls have combined to prompt several schools to ring the summer holiday bell early this time.  
	We have decided to close down for the summer vacation on May 11 this time instead of May 15 when the summer vacation normally begins every year, said Krishna Damani of South Point School.        
	The schools termed this a rare occurrence and struggled to remember the last time they had given over early for the summer.        
	We will be beginning our summer vacation a little early this time, specially for the heat, said Malini Bhagat, the principal of Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School, where the holidays begin on May 8.        
	From May 4 to 8, the routine at Mahadevi Birla will be set in a way that all students do not have to attend classes every day. For instance, on May 4 the students of the middle section will not have to come. That is being done to ensure that not all the students are required to bear the heat every day, said Bhagat.        
	Schools like Rajasthan Vidya Mandir, Vivekananda Mission, Sacred Heart and Welland Gouldsmith have also preponed their summer holidays.        
	Several students had fallen ill because of the heat wave last week. The early closure will give some relief to students if the temperature rises again in May, said Damani of South Point.        
	The head of a school in central Calcutta said frequent power cuts and shortage of drinking water supply have compounded the problem.        
	There is an acute drinking water scarcity here. We are forced to buy water worth Rs 700 every day from the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and a local NGO. This cannot go on. So we have decided to shut for the summer holidays on May 8 or 9, instead of May 15, said Kajari Mukherjee, the principal of Rajasthan Vidya Mandir in central Calcutta.        
	An official of another school in Burrabazar said there was no point keeping the school open till May 15 as at least 15 to 20 students are absent every day.        
	Students are complaining that they are not able to sleep because of the power cuts in this heat. We will be closing early to ease their suffering, said the principal, preferring not to be named.        
	Some schools are reeling under the twin blows of heat and hustings. The heat of course is one of the reasons for advancing the summer vacation, but the decision to close on May 9 instead of May 16 has also been prompted by the fact that many of our buses have been requisitioned for the elections, said Keya Sinha, the principal of Vivekananda Mission.        
	Welland Gouldsmith will give over on May 9 because the school premises will be taken over by the Election Commission from May 10.        
	One school that can claim to have done yesterday what the others are doing today is Modern High.         
	Following the trend of unbearable summers we had decided two years ago to extend our summer holidays. Productivity is affected by the heat so we decided it was better to work in more pleasant weather conditions, said Devi Kar, the principal of Modern High, where the summer holiday starts on May 8.

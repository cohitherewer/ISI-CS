The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Couple held with drugs
                                                                                                               Couple held with drugs
          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	A couple were arrested in Karaya on Friday with over 3kg charas and Rs 9.12 lakh.         
	Phuljhuri Begum and her husband Seikh Rashid, both in their 30s, had collected the money by selling narcotics, said cops.         
	Acting on a tip-off that Seikh Rashid, alias China, would meet a client in Ahiripukur First Lane, plainclothesmen from the narcotics wing of Calcutta polices detective department were waiting there from 8am.        
	Rashid was held as soon as he appeared half an hour later. He was allegedly carrying around 1.2kg of charas.        
	China led the policemen to a small house near Bandarpatty shanty, where he lived with Phuljhuri.         
	She was arrested. A search revealed another 1.1kg of charas. Under the bed was a plastic bag with a bundle of Rs 500 notes.         
	It appears that the couple were planning to leave the city and so had kept their sales proceeds with them, said city detective chief Jawed Shamim.        
	Most of the charas that the couple sold was supplied to them by dealers from South 24-Parganas, including city fringe areas like Ghutiari Sheriff. The carriers generally used to hand over the narcotics near Park Circus railway station. China would then hand over the charas in smaller quantities to his salesmen, who fan out across the city, said an investigating officer.        
	Chinas clients were scattered in parts of Park Circus, No. 4 bridge and Entally, added the officer.        
	Police sources said Chinas narcotics trade had flourished over the past year. The police are not sure if the couple had teamed up with other peddlers across the city like 30-year-old Angurbala and Buri Harijan of Duttabad.        
	Angurbala controlled the drugs trade around Sealdah while Buri Harijan operated in Duttabad and Phoolbagan. Both women were arrested last year, said an investigator.

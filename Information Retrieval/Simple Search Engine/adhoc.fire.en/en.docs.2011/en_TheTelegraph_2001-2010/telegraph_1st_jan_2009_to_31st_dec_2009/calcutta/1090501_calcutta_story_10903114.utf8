The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Oars hit mud in lake placid
                                                                                                               Oars hit mud in lake placid

	Soumesh Roy has been rowing at the Dhakuria Lakes for 12 years but never have his oars struck mud, instead of water. Never until now, when the hottest and driest April in Calcutta for six decades has caused the water level to drop by more than six feet in places.        
	The level of water has dropped so much that our boats are in danger of being damaged. Our oars are getting stuck in the mud, says Soumesh, 25.        
	Like Soumesh, rowers from various rowing clubs around Rabindra Sarobar are hitting mud for the first time, with a rainless April causing the water level of the lake  stretching for around 1.7km from I.L.S.S (Indian Life Saving Society, formerly Anderson Club) to Tollygunge bridge  to drop alarmingly.        
	In all my 40 years here I have never seen the watermark drop so drastically. This year, the dry heat is so bad that the water level of the lake has fallen by around six feet, says Ujjal Kumar Dugar, the captain of boats at Bengal Rowing Club (BRC).        
	All rowing clubs are in the same boat this summer.        
	Chandan Roy Choudhury, the secretary of Calcutta Rowing Club for the past nine years, says this is the worst he has seen of the Lakes.        
	Because of the heat wave, even the fish are dying and the water hyacinths are growing wild.... If the weather remains like this, we will think twice before holding our annual summer coaching camp for children from May 15 to June 15.        
	At Lake Club, the rowers are a frustrated lot. The portion just under the Dhakuria Lake Bridge is the worst and our rowers come back complaining that there is hardly any water there. Also, the floating jetty may not be able to float anymore if the level of water drops any further and boats will have trouble descending into the bay area just in front of the jetty, says Subrata Guha, the joint secretary of Lake Club.        
	The stretch under the Dhakuria Lake Bridge, used for long-distance practice from I.L.S.S. to the tail of the lake near Tollygunge bridge, has a water depth of only four feet now, as opposed to the 10 feet-plus it should be.        
	All around the lake, much of the bank is visible, watermark, drainage points and all. The floating jetty that leads into the lake is at its lowest permissible level. The jetty is adjustable according to the level of water but now we cannot lower it any more. The riggers of the boat are hitting against the jetty, causing damage and reducing leverage capacity, says R.M. Lakhotia, the chairman of the rowing committee at BRC.        
	The average cost of a boat is Rs 2 lakh while the better ones cost Rs 3.5 lakh. The oars cost Rs 20,000 each. The oars come from the US and if any one of them is damaged, it is considered a loss because repair is not possible here, adds Lakhotia.        
	With the Met office finally holding out hope of some rain over the weekend, the clubs at the Lakes will be rowing the boat more gently than ever, with an eye on the sky.

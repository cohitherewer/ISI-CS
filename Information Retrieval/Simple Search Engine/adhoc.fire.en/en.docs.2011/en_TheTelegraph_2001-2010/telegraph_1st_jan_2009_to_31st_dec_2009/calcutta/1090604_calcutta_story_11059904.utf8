The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Protest over posts
                                                                                                               Protest over posts

	About 1,500 former students of primary teachers training institutes beat up primary education department officials and their drivers, damaged cars and fought with policemen during a demonstration at Karunamoyee on Wednesday.         
	Two demonstrators were arrested for attacking policemen and four for damaging government property. Three policemen and five demonstrators were injured.        
	The demonstrators were demanding that the degrees awarded by the 144 primary teachers training institutes in the state be recognised and the degree-holders be given preference during recruitment of primary teachers.        
	The high court in an October 2008 order had de-recognised the degrees since the institutes violated conditions set by the National Council of Teachers Education Act. The decision affected over 75,000 degree-holders.         
	Around 1pm on Wednesday, the protesters blocked the road outside Bikash Bhavan to press their demand. They rushed to nearby Acharya Prafulla Chandra Bhavan an hour later after learning that primary education minister Partha De was meeting representatives of the district primary school councils there.        
	By the time the protesters assembled De had left the building and others were on their way out. According to witnesses, the group stopped at least nine cars carrying chairmen of the councils, beat up the occupants and damaged the vehicles. The chairmen of the Bankura and South 24-Parganas councils were heckled and had to take shelter in Bikash Bhavan.        
	Arun Mann, who was driving the car carrying the Burdwan council chairman, said: The demonstrators ran towards the vehicle and broke the windshield. When I tried to stop them from puncturing the tyres, they broke my hand by slamming the door against it.        
	A contingent of over 50 from the nearby police stations brought the situation under control around 5pm.        
	Anandabaran Honda, the president of the institutes students union, claimed that the police had lathicharged their peaceful protest and admitted that they had damaged some cars. The police denied there was lathicharge.        
	De condemned the violence.

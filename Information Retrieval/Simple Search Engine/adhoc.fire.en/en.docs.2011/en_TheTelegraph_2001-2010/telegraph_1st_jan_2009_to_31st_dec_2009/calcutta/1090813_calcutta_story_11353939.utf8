                                                                                                               Court asks for film scripts
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A division bench of Calcutta High Court on Wednesday directed the producers of Hindi film Namastey London and Bengali film Poran Jai Joliya Re to submit their scripts and sequence charts on Friday.         
	The same day the division bench of Justice P.C. Ghosh and Justice I.P. Mukerji will hear the appeal by Poran Jai... makers against an order by Justice Nadira Patheriya which stayed the screening of the Bengali film on the ground that it was a copy of Namaste London.        
	The director and producer of Namastey London, Vipul Shah, had stated in the court that he would not file a contempt plea against Poran Jai... producer Shree Venaktesh Films till the appeal was disposed of.        
	Justice Patheriya had watched both films before announcing that the Poran Jai... producers had infringed on the copyright of Namaste London.        
	The Bengali film is being screened in 115 halls across the state.

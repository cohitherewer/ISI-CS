The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Two-hour torment spares none
                                                                                                               Two-hour torment spares none
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Jadavpur University went without power for around 48 hours because of a transformer fault. Supply was restored late on Tuesday                                      
	The citys electricity requirement soared to the seasons highest on another sizzling day and demand outstripped supply, forcing power cuts by turns in almost every locality.        
	The heat wave-like condition has pushed up demand to 1528 MW, which is the highest this summer and around 150 MW more than last years peak, said a CESC official.         
	CESC and the West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd together fell short by 188 MW, leading to phased loadshedding for up to two hours each in all areas.        
	When we were spared the blackout on Sunday, I had thought to myself: Thank god, we are not part of Calcutta! But the past 24 hours have been very bad. There was an hour-long power cut from midnight, followed by one at 8am and then again at 4pm, said Arindam Roy Choudhury, a young businessman from HB block in Salt Lake.        
	The performance of CESC units whose freak collapse triggered Sundays blackout was optimal on Tuesday. They generated 900 MW, their maximum combined capacity, an official said.        
	The shortage was apparently caused by the state-owned distribution companys failure to supply more than 455 MW. Our plants are not generating enough power, a source in the West Bengal Power Development Corporation Ltd said.        
	Managing director S. Mahapatra blamed it on high-ash coal, the kind that affects output, he said.        
	There was another scare when three units at Bakreswar and all six operating units of Durgapur Projects Ltd collapsed on Monday. A conductor fault had led to voltage fluctuation and caused the breakdown. However, all units except a 300 MW plant were revived in two hours, an official said.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee summoned power secretary Sunil Mitra and asked him to ensure that all possible precautionary steps were taken to eliminate technical snags.         
	With the mercury showing no sign of climbing down and power continuing to play truant, air-conditioned malls with power back-up became the chosen refuge of some scorched citizens. We have noticed an increase in footfall, especially between noon and 4pm, said a representative of Forum on Elgin Road.        
	A spokesperson for Mani Square, on the EM Bypass, said the heat and the power cuts could be a blessing in disguise for malls in the time of downturn. People are coming in even on weekdays and sales are rising, he said.

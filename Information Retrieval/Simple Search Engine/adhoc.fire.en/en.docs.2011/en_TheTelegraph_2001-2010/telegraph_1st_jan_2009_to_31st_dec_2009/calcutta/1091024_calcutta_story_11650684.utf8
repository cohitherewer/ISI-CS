The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Suicide bid in railway office
                                                                                                               Suicide bid in railway office
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A youth consumed poison inside the divisional railway managers office in Howrah on Thursday afternoon on being told that he would not get a job, five years after his father had died in harness.         
	Rama Shankar Harijan, 20, was admitted to the Howrah Orthopaedic Hospital in a serious condition. His family members said two clerks had demanded Rs 50,000 from him for quick processing of his application.        
	When Rama refused to pay them, one of the clerks allegedly told him that he would not get a railway job as his application had gone missing. Soon after, the youth from Burdwan went out, bought poison and consumed it after returning to the office. Railway policemen saw him writhing in pain and vomiting and took him to hospital.        
	Rama had applied for the job two months after his father, a Group D staff of Eastern Railway, died in March 2004. If he had applied under the death-in-harness quota in 2004, he should have got the job by now. I do not know why his appointment was delayed. I shall conduct an inquiry, said Mohammad Jamsed, the divisional railway manager.        
	Ramas elder brother Shiva Prasad said: Since 2004, clerks dealing with the job application had been pressuring Rama for money. A clerk in Burdwan station took Rs 1,800 from my brother and another clerk took Rs 6,000. On Thursday, he broke down when a clerk demanded Rs 50,000.

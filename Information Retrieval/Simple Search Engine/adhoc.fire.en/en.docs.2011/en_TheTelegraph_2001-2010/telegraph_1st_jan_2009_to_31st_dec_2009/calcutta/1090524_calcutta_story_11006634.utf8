The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Two men in womens book hub
                                                                                                               Two men in womens book hub
                            
	Soi Boi doesnt invite all and sundry to its adda sessions. Entry is strictly by invitation. So when author Sunil Gangopadhyay was invited to Soi Bois book launch at Bangla Akademi on Thursday, he said he was thrilled to bits  just as he was when he had attended an event at Bagbazar Multipurpose Girls High School once, he said. That was my first entry into a girls school!         
	Somewhat similarly, Gangopadhyay said he was always keen to be in this womens only publishing club. Why should just Nabanita (Dev Sen) and her friends have fun? asked the septuagenarian.         
	In fact, he was not the only man around at the launch when 15 books, all by women, were released. Gangopadhyay and poet Nirendranath Chakrabarty launched the books.         
	Of the 15, nine were of poetry. Chakrabarty released them, commenting in rhyme: Hoi hoi kore Soi-er boi berulo, thoi thoi korche (The Soi books came out with a lot of fanfare and are to be found everywhere).         
	Chakrabarty feels that women are possessed with a deeper knowledge than men. Once a woman friend had asked me what is that one word with which a woman may address another woman but never a man. When I didnt have the answer, she said it was Olo (an endearing term a woman has for her female friend).         
	But neither Chakraborty nor Gangopadhyay were too keen on gender divide in literary creativity. In the 21st century, words like poetess and authoress are becoming politically incorrect, said Gangopadhyay who talked of Kabita Singha, his contemporary who sat at the same table as us in Coffee House and who refused to be categorised as a woman poet.         
	But both the men acknowledged it was impossible to go through life without women.                          ANASUYA BASU

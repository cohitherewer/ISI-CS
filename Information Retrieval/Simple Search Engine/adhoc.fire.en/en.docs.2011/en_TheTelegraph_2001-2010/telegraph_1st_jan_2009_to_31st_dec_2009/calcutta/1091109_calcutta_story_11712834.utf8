The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Flu strikes city as Celsius fluctuates 
                                                                            Monday , November 9 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Flu strikes city as Celsius fluctuates

	If Delhi is battling freak fog, fluctuating temperatures in Calcutta over the past few weeks have left the city flu-struck.        
	Patients with fever, cold, cough and respiratory distress have been flooding clinics and the outpatient departments of government and private hospitals ever since temperatures dipped below normal a couple of weeks ago, only to rise again.        
	Such fluctuations are ideal for bacteria and virus to proliferate. Children need special protection when viruses strike, and even common flu symptoms should not be ignored at this time of the year, said Apurba Ghosh, the director of the Institute of Child Health.         
	A post-Diwali nip in the air had culminated in the coolest October 23 in a decade but it wasnt to be an early winter for the city. The weather has since remained warm with the past week being unusually sultry for November. According to the Met office, winter is still some weeks away.        
	Ghosh said the majority of children being brought to the Institute of Child Health were infants with respiratory distress or failure triggered by lung congestion.         
	Three to four per cent of these children have required hospitalisation. In the past couple of weeks, on an average two children every week have had to be put on the ventilator because of respiratory failure, he added.        
	Pulmonologists warn that viral fever can aggravate pre-existing lung diseases like asthma, bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.        
	This season there has been a significant rise in lung infection or pneumonia. For elderly people and patients with renal failure and diabetes, pneumonia can be life-threatening, said Ashok Sengupta, consultant pulmonologist at Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals.         
	He said more than 70 per cent of the patients with pre-existing chest problems were complaining of respiratory tract and lung infections triggered by temperature fluctuations.        
	People suffering from lung diseases should avoid coming in contact with someone with a running nose or other symptoms of viral fever. They should constantly be on preventive medication, Sengupta advised.        
	People suffering from asthma and other respiratory tract diseases could also get themselves immunised against influenza and pneumonia, say doctors.        
	Paracetamol and anti-allergic medicines are the basic cures but if fever persists then antibiotics are required. In any case, caution is the watchword during the change of season. So just be careful, said critical care specialist Subrata Maitra.

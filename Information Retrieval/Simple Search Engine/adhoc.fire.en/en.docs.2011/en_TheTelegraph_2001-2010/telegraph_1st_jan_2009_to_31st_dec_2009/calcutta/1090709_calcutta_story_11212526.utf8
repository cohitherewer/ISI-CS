The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | BSNL block for a week 
                                                                                                               BSNL block for a week 
          OUR BUREAU                                      
	Broadband will draw a blank and Bfone landlines wont beep for up to a week in parts of the city, including the residences of the chief minister and the police commissioner.        
	Officials of BSNL have warned of slow recovery of services disrupted by a transmission room fire at the Circus Telephone Exchange on Tuesday night.        
	Recovery will begin only on Thursday and we hope to restore the critical telephone lines by 10pm. The other lines will be restored in a week, S.K. Chakravarty, the chief general manager of Calcutta Telephones, told Metro on Wednesday.        
	A source said alternative arrangements might be made to restore BSNL services in the VIP homes affected by the breakdown.        
	More than 64,500 landline, 12,000 broadband and 1,600 leased line connections went on the blink after Tuesdays fire forced BSNL to shut down its mother exchange on Hungerford Street.        
	Work in hospitals, offices, banks, hotels and business establishments along AJC Bose Road, Park Street, Jawaharlal Nehru Road, Bondel Road, Picnic Garden and EM Bypass was affected throughout Wednesday.        
	Telephones in a few police stations, including Park Street, Shakespeare Sarani and Karaya, were inaccessible. We are trying to make do with wireless sets. We have asked for at least 10 WLL phones to restore connectivity in key points, including the chief ministers residence, said an officer in Lalbazar.         
	ATMs in the affected areas were also out of service. My bank is unable to carry out transactions. The other branches are also facing the same problem. I will have to come back on Thursday, said Mitali Bhattacharya, who has an account with the Gol Park branch of Axis Bank.        
	Hospitals and nursing homes, including National Medical College and Hospital, Belle-Vue and Sambhunath Pandit Hospital, appealed to BSNL to restore services on a priority basis. Its so difficult running a hospital without basic communication links, said S.K. Saha, the medical superintendent and vice-principal of National Medical College and Hospital.        
	Calcutta Telephones is making arrangements for fixed wireless telephone service to hospitals, high commissions and VIPs, and diverting services to corporate networks through other main switching nodes. Three service centres have been opened at Telephone Bhavan, Ballygunge Place and the Entally exchange for consumers to access free voice and data services.        
	Officials said Calcutta Telephones would adjust Rs 100 worth of talk time for affected landline customers in the next telephone bill.

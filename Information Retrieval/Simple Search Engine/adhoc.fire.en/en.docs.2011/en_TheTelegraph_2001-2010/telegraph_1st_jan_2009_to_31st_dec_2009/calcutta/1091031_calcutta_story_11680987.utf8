          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                               
	The high court on Friday allowed Bidhannagar Municipality to renovate and extend the market in BD block.        
	The extension and renovation of the market should be carried out for the greater good of the people, the division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice B. Somadder observed while dismissing a petition by residents of the block.        
	The petitioners had alleged that Bidhannagar Municipality had violated building norms while planning the market revamp.        
	The bench also ordered the municipal authorities to complete the extension and renovation work in a year and a half.

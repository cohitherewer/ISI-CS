                      Sundaram 52                    Sundaram will celebrate its 52nd anniversary with the staging of two plays; its classic Sajano Bagan, to be presented this evening and tomorrow, its latest production, Ja Nei Bharatey. The former play deals with mans obsessive, possessive love for life and anything that he has achieved through hard work. Thus, old Banchharam is torn between his desire to live happily with his grandson and his newly-wedded wife and his commitment to give away his beloved orchard to the zamindars son in return for the promise of a princely funeral on his death. Tomorrows play Ja Nei Bharatey taps the ancient roots of Indian culture, testing the knowledge embedded in the Puranas with our new awareness in an age of globalisation and scientific progress. Narrating events that took place before the birth of Dhritarashtra and Pandu in the Mahabharata, it traces the crosscurrents of aims and desires that shape time. Direction and performance (in lead roles in both plays): Manoj Mitra.                  Event: Two plays to mark Sundarams 52nd anniversary When: Today at Minerva Theatre and tomorrow at Girish Mancha; 6.30 pm

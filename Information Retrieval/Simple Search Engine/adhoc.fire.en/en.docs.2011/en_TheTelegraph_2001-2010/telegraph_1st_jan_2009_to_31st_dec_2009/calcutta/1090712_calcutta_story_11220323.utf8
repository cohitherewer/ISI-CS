The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Loopholes help marital violence
                                                                                                               Loopholes help marital violence
                              A still from Whats Love Got To Do With It, a film based on Tina Turners life. The singer-actress was a victim of domestic violence                            
	Meera Ganguly (name changed) of Chandernagore would be beaten up regularly by her husband of two years as she hadnt brought enough dowry. Meera started a case against her husband under Section 498A of the IPC, the anti-dowry law. But the beatings didnt stop. Members of Prabartak Seva Niketan, a local NGO, told her about the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act 2005, which would not only arm her with a court order restraining her husband from beating her but also give her residence rights and maintenance rights. She was told the Act was not a criminal law and she could lodge a civil law suit against her husband.        
	Meera had nowhere to go. Her parents couldnt take her back after borrowing heavily for her wedding. She had a one-year-old child to look after. The only place she could call home was her husbands.        
	We advised Meera to visit the protection officer, a government representative who deals with domestic violence incidents, in the district, said Mahendra Kumar Ghosh, a member of Prabartak Seva Niketan, the local service provider, an NGO that has the licence to aid victims of domestic violence.        
	Meera met the protection officer and her case was taken up for hearing by the magistrate, but her husband could not be brought to court to attend a single hearing.        
	Even as the Act is hailed as inclusive and radical, an effective tool to fight domestic violence, almost everyone agrees on the problems of implementing it. Ranjana Kumari, the director of the Centre for Social Research, New Delhi, said: There is very little awareness about the Act among women and the stakeholders  protection officers, service providers, local NGOs licensed to protect and help victims, police and community members. As a result, women are yet to realise the full benefit of this law.         
	In Meeras case, the enforcement of the law was weak. The husband proved to be elusive. He would slink into his house after dark and leave before it was light. When we delivered the court summons for him to appear, his lawyer appeared on his behalf and said since he is already fighting a case under Section 498A, he neednt appear in this case, said Ghosh.         
	Even if Meeras husband was fighting a case under Section 498A, it did not exempt him from appearing before the magistrate for a case under the prevention of domestic violence Act. Sadly, neither the service provider, nor the protection officer knew this. Till date Meera continues to fight the case, getting fresh dates from the court.        
	A lot remains to be done with the Act, passed in 2005 and implemented since August 2006. Says Mira Roy, a consultant, who conducts training and workshops for volunteers: The only effective thing about the law has been that the cases are coming up for hearing faster.        
	Roy, who has translated the Act into Bengali, a first and vital step in educating all stakeholders, says by and large it has benefited those who have access to quality legal services. Though the Act provides for state legal aid, the quality of services in such cases is really poor, she said. Roy thinks that the attitude of implementing agencies is not conducive to effective implementation. The protection officers are often hostile to victims, says Roy.         
	Anchita Ghatak of Parichiti says the state has passed on all responsibility to the service providers. They have to provide medical aid to abused women, arrange for short stay homes and arrange for compensation. It becomes a burden on these providers who do not have the wherewithal, said Ghatak.         
	In the city, NGO Swayam has filed 14 cases under the prevention of domestic violence Act, among which it has secured one final order and two interim orders of protection, residence and maintenance, says Gargi Guha. The fastest order came about in two months. In two other cases filed in February and March 2007, no relief is in sight as the protection officers are yet to file the domestic incident report, a vital document for the magistrate.        
	However, the fact remains that even if the domestic violence prevention Act arms the woman with protection and maintenance rights in the husbands home, it in effect puts an end to the marriage. Says Roy: These women do not have the courage to walk out of the marriage. We need to empower them so they can be confident of surviving outside the house that has given them so much grief.                    ANASUYA BASU

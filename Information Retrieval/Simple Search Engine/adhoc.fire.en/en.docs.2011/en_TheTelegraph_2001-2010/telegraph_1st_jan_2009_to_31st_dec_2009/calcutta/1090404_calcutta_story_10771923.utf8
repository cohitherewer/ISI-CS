The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Youth dies, crushed by buses
                                                                                                               Youth dies, crushed by buses
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Three passengers standing on the rear footboard of a private bus that was racing to overtake another were crushed between the two vehicles, one of them dying moments later.        
	The injured duo have been admitted to the intensive care unit of SSKM Hospital.        
	Police said the mishap occurred on Friday evening at the Kidderpore crossing while a bus on route 12C/1A (WB19-6611), travelling from Howrah to Pailan, was overtaking another bus on the same route that had stopped to pick up passengers.        
	The identity of the youth who died could not be established till late on Friday. Witnesses said he was a resident of the locality.        
	The injured youths are Sheikh Suman and Asim Chowdhury. Suman, 20, is a resident of Thakurpukur, while 21-year-old Asim lives in Behala.        
	A preliminary probe revealed that the tragedy was triggered by reckless driving. The bus, on the footboard of which the victims were standing, tried to overtake the other vehicle though there was hardly any space during the evening rush, said Uttam Mukherjee, the additional officer-in-charge of Watgunge police station.        
	Mohammed Jawed, a local resident who witnessed the mishap, said the driver did not slam the brakes even after hitting the stationary bus.        
	Realising that some passengers had been squeezed between the two buses, the driver accelerated and the victims were dragged along. The trio slumped to the road after the bus crossed the other vehicle, Jawed added.         
	As a group of onlookers chased the bus, the driver tried to speed off but lost control and mounted the tram tracks at the Ekbalpore crossing before coming to a halt.        
	The driver and the conductors fled. We are trying to get in touch with the owner of the bus, said a police officer.         
	The three bleeding passengers were rushed to SSKM Hospital, where one of them was declared dead on arrival.         
	Residents blamed the accident on the lack of traffic policing in the area.        
	This is a crowded stretch and buses dont follow any rules. Both buses involved in the mishap violated traffic norms, said Rajnath Borai, a local resident.        
	The first bus had stopped ahead of the designated bus stop and the driver of the second one tried to swerve past it dangerously. Such fatal mishaps will recur unless policing is stepped up, he added.

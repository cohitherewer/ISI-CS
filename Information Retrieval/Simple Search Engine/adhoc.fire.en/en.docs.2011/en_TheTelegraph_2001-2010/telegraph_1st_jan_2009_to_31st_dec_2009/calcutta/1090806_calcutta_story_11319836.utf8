                      History of Western music                    What were monophonic Gregorian Chants? Who codified them and when were they composed? Why did Western classical music become polyphonic during the Renaissance? What kind of music did Bach, Handel and Vivaldi compose during the Baroque period? When was opera as a musical composition born? In how many languages were operas composed and what are some of the most memorable operas? Is Western classical music associated with only the Classical period? Which European city was the hub of Western classical music at the time? What was the contribution of the Romantics to Western classical music? What are some of Chopins most famous compositions? How did the 20th century impact Western classical music? Who were the famous conductors, tenors, divas or music critics of the last century? What is the fate of Western classical music today? Beethoven and Friends answers these questions and more while presenting the history of Western classical music through the unusual stories of the many lives that shaped it. It is written by Kishore Chatterjee, a Western classical music aficionado who is, perhaps, also its greatest champion and torch-bearer in town. Chatterjee has made it his lifes mission to win friends over for Western classical music and communicate its enjoyment through the written word, lectures, films, drama and painting. Since 1970, he has given talks and anchored programmes on Western classical music, including a series on Wagner, Bach, Beethoven, opera and some well-known music critics.

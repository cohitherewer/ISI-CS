                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Robbery racket targets women job seekers
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A racket involved in robbing women looking for a job by luring them to hotels is at work in Calcutta.        
	Police suspect several homemakers and young women looking for their first job were robbed by the gang.         
	Officers found out about the racket while investigating a complaint lodged by 21-year-old Riya De with Baguiati police station on Saturday.        
	The modus operandi of the gang is simple. It publishes advertisements in the name of a fictitious company, asking job seekers to contact a mobile number. They encourage freshers to apply so that more people get in touch with them, said an investigator.         
	Riya, a fresh commerce graduate, was one such applicant. She was asked to come to the showroom of a reputable car company at Kestopur with her CV.        
	A man took the CV from her at the showroom and said he would call her later.        
	On Saturday, Riya was asked to collect her appointment letter from a hotel near Baguiati. She was robbed off gold jewellery in a room of the hotel.        
	We came to know of Sumita Saha, a Jadavpur resident, who had booked the hotel room where Riya was taken by another member of the gang. We went to Sumitas Jadavpur home but found it locked. As both the gang members Riya interacted with are absconding, we are yet to find out how many people were duped, said an officer.        
	According to him, the gang has other women members, including some who are married.        
	Officers are probing how a gang member managed to meet Riya on the premises of the car company. Preliminary investigations suggest that the man was not involved with the company.         
	The gang members win the trust of job seekers by taking their CVs on the reception area of reputable companies. The applicants are asked not to speak to receptionists and other company personnel on the pretext of confidentiality. We are trying to find out why the security guards of the car showroom did not stop Riya and the man who met her from entering the premises, added the investigating officer.

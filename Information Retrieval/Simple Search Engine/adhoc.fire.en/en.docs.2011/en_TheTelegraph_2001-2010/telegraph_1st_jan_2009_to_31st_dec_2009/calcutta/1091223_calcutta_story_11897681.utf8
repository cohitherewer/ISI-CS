The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 3 held for permit racket
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      3 held for permit racket
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Three men were arrested on Tuesday for allegedly running a permit racket involving commercial vehicles by using fake challans. City detective chief Damayanti Sen said the trio  Bablu Dey, 45, Mahadeb Brahma, 38, and Bapi Kodali, 48  were arrested in their homes.        
	The scam came to light earlier this month when transport department officials detected two challans with the same serial number, which appeared to have been issued by the RBI.        
	A preliminary probe indicated Bablu was the kingpin. The racket was active for the past few years. The three have been remanded in police custody for 14 days, Sen said.         
	The detective department launched a probe on December 8 after being alerted by transport minister Ranjit Kundu about vehicle permits being issued on the basis of fake challans.         
	The police suspect Bablu, a resident of Belghoria, ran the racket with the help of several touts. Mahadeb is a resident of Sodepur while Bapi lives with his family in Howrah.         
	Following the arrests, the transport department ordered an internal inquiry to assess the extent of revenue loss.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fares up from August 1
                                                                                                               Fares up from August 1
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The fares of buses, minibuses and taxis will be raised from August 1.        
	The revised fares, which the government linked with the recent hike in fuel prices, are same as those that prevailed between July 11, 2008, and February 9, 2009.        
	When the Centre had raised the fuel prices in June last year, the state government raised the fares following demands from transporters. The rollback of the fuel prices led to the downward revision in February despite opposition from the operators.        
	Under the new structure, the minimum fare of taxis  up to 2km  has been increased by Rs 2 to Rs 22. Thereafter, the commuter will be charged Rs 2 for every 200 metre. To calculate the fare, one has to double the meter reading and add two to the figure. The waiting charge has been raised by 50 paise to Rs 1.50 for every 132 seconds.        
	For buses and minibuses, the minimum fares remain unchanged at Rs 4 and Rs 5, respectively.        
	This is what the operators have been asking. They should be happy now, said a senior official in the transport department.        
	Bengal Bus Syndicate president Swarnakamal Saha and Minibus Coordination Committee general secretary Abashesh Daw both said they were happy with the revision.        
	The transporters also decided to call off their indefinite strike from July 22.        
	The strike had been called to protest transport minister Subhas Chakrabortys initial refusal to raise fares and government atrocities while implementing the ban on two-stroke autos and old commercial vehicles.        
	The Bengal Bus Syndicate had tried to move the high court on Wednesday regarding the July 31 phaseout deadline, pleading for a chance to make the engines of old buses pollution-free. But Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar refused to accept the prayer.

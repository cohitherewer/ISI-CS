The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Missing: taxis and inspectors
                                                                                                               Missing: taxis and inspectors
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Only four city taxis turned up at the meter testing centre at Salt Lake on Monday, the first day of the check after the high court refused to stay the governments notification making it mandatory twice a year.        
	Not a single taxi meter could be tested as motor vehicles inspectors from the public vehicles department (PVD), who are supposed to oversee the process, did not make it to the centre.        
	Taxi drivers and inspectors willing, 200 meters could have been tested on Monday, said officials at the state government facility, being run by Bhagwandas Vehicle Testing Services on a built-operate-transfer basis.        
	Almost 35,000 taxis are registered with the PVD. The government issued a notification on February 18 making it mandatory to get their meters tested at the Salt Lake centre twice a year against a payment of Rs 300. Taxis with expired meter test certificates can be fined up to Rs 3,000, said transport department officials.        
	According to taxi union sources, at least half the taxis plying in the city are due for meter tests. But not one of them has so far obtained a certificate from the Salt Lake centre.        
	Inspectors of the PVD, too, have not come to the centre since it opened on March 17, said a transport department official.         
	Inspectors from the Alipore regional transport authority and the 5,000 taxis registered there have also been absent at the centre.        
	Taxis from the Howrah, Barasat and Barrackpore regional transport authorities have been going for meter checks. Over 85 per cent of the meters were found to be tampered with.        
	Senior officials of the PVD and the Alipore regional transport authority said motor vehicle inspectors were resisting the computerised check on taxi meters.        
	Computerised tests would deny motor vehicle inspectors the opportunity to accept bribes and provide certificates to taxis with tempered metres, said an official.        
	Taxi unions blamed the PVD. We do not want to disobey the court but we are helpless. Unless the officials end their agitation we cannot go to the new meter testing centre, said Bimal Guha, the general secretary of the Bengal Taxi Association.

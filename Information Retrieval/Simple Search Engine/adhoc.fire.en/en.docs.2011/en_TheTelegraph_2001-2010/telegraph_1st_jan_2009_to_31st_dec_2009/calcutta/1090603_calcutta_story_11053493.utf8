The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cable blow to sports fans
                                                                                                               Cable blow to sports fans
  - Channel, MSO lock horns          RITH BASU                          Roger Federer in action at Roland Garros. (AFP)                                        
	Nearly a third of the citys cable homes are set to miss the big weekend at Roland Garros and a chunk of the Twenty20 World Cup with ESPN STAR Sports channels off the Manthan bouquet.         
	The multi-system operator (MSO), the second largest in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area with about 8 lakh subscribers, has not been showing ESPN, STAR Sports and STAR Cricket since March 31, allegedly over a dues dispute.        
	STAR Sports is currently showing French Open live. STAR Cricket is slated to telecast the Twenty20 World Cup from Friday.        
	Matches featuring India and the semi-finals and finals of the tournament will also be beamed on Doordarshan.         
	The MSO remains tight-lipped about why the channels have gone missing.        
	Several cases are on between ESPN STAR Sports and us in the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal. We cant comment on the matter since it is sub-judice, said a Manthan official.        
	Manthan issued a public notice in the first week of February stating ESPN STAR Sports does not have good content and withdrew the channels from March 31, said Subhadip Bhattacharya, the senior director (distribution) of east and west India of ESPN STAR Sports.        
	He added that the MSO had dues with the company, which, according to industry sources, is the bone of contention.         
	The blame game is of little interest to fans missing out on the action.        
	I havent been able to catch a single French Open match this year because of the blackout. With Federer on course to make history and Leander Paes also reaching the semi-final, I am praying the channels are restored. Plus, I would rather watch the World Cup on STAR Cricket than on Doordarshan, said sports fanatic Arnab Jyoti Paul, a young Lake Town resident.         
	The chances of the sports beam returning before the weekend appear bleak.         
	We are always open to discussions, said Bhattacharya, while the Manthan official blamed the broadcaster for lack of transparency.        
	The company is advertising that the T20 World Cup will be live and exclusive on its beam but it will also be shown on Doordarshan, alleged the MSO official.        
	Matches featuring India will be shown on Doordarshan since there is a government ruling. I dont see how that can be a problem, countered Bhattacharya.

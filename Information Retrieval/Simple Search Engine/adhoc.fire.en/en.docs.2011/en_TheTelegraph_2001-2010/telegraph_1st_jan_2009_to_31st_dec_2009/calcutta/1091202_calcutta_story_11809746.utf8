	Police have asked the Taj Bengal management to step up security during the scheduled stay of the Indian and Sri Lankan cricket teams for the December 24 ODI at Eden Gardens.        
	At a recent meeting, the police told the officials overseeing security at the Alipore hospitality address to deploy all their 16 guards at some of the strategic points in the compound as well as outside. Guards of private agencies hired by the hotel have been asked to wear their identity cards.        
	The footage of the closed-circuit cameras will be monitored round-the-clock in a designated control room on the premises. The guards who will monitor the footage have been asked to report any suspicious movement to the authorities and note down his observations in a register.        
	The security advisory has been explained to officials responsible for the hotels security, said a senior officer at Lalbazar.        
	The guards have also been asked to check and maintain a record of all vehicles, including two-wheelers, that are parked in the parking lot adjacent to the main entrance.        
	Guard rails have been installed in the parking lot to streamline the flow of vehicles and the hotel authorities have been asked to increase the number of guard in the lot from one to two.        
	The guards have been also asked to frisk anyone walking into the hotel compound. We have also asked them to place door-frame metal detectors two feet outside the three main gates, said another officer.         
	Last week, police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti had expressed concern over security at the stadium during a meeting with office-bearers of the Cricket Association of Bengal. While inspecting the stadium, the police chief is learnt to have said that the focus during the ODI would be on both technical and physical security.

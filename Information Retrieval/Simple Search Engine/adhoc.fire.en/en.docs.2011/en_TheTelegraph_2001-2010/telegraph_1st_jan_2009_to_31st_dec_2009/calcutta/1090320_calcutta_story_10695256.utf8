The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Blockade disrupts trains
                                                                                                               Blockade disrupts trains
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Trains between Calcutta and Mumbai were disrupted on Thursday because of a blockade at Gidhni station in the Kharagpur-Tata section of South Eastern Railway (SER).        
	Around 300 people of Gidhni Block Nagarik Samity put up the blockade at 7am demanding that some mail and express trains stop at Gidhni and trains be introduced between Howrah and Gidhni. The blockade was withdrawn around 3.45pm.        
	The Howrah-Tata Steel Express was cancelled and the Howrah-Barbil Jan Shatabdi Express was short terminated at Kharagpur, from where it returned to Howrah.         
	The Howrah-Titlagarh Ispat Express, short terminated at Kharagpur, also returned to Howrah. The Howrah-bound Ispat Express from Titlagarh stopped at Chakradharpur.         
	The Mumbai-Howrah Gitanjali Express, Ahmedabad-Howrah Express, LTT-Shalimar Express and the New Delhi-Bhubaneswar Rajdhani Express were diverted on their way to Calcutta.         
	The current sale of tickets at Gidhni does not merit a long-distance train stop, said Saumitra Majumdar, the chief public relations officer of SER. Another blockade will be put up on Sunday by the passengers committee of Sardiah, a station near Kharagpur, with similar demands.

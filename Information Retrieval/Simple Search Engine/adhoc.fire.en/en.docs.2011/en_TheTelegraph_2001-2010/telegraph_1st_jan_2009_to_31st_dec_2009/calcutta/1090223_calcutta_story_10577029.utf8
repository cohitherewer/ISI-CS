                      Gliding grace                     They move most easily through life, who have learned to dance  Ann Dirkson.        Roger Sinha, artistic director and the man behind Sinha Danse, Montreal, is a renowned choreographer/ dancer whose compositions have been critically acclaimed throughout Canada, Europe, Asia and the US. Several of his pieces have been filmed for television. Sapphire along with Centre of Studies and Research on Modern Dance, Rabindra Bharati University jointly host the Calcutta premiere of Burning Skin, Zeros amp; Ones and Quebesian Rhapsody by members of Sinha Danse. The troupe focuses on the creation of original dance pieces that integrate contemporary and classical Indian dance forms, theatre, martial arts, ballet and improvisation. Sinha uses the universality of the body to explore cultural harmony, dissonance and tensions created by the collision of the East and the West. He combines expressive hastas (hand gestures) and rhythmically complex footwork of Indian dance with the full body movements of modern ballet and martial arts to explore new vistas in the sphere of modern ballet. His group promotes cultural diversity and works to support the cause of the visible minority artists. Hence, a rare treat indeed for both connoisseurs and dance lovers.                    Event: Modern ballet presented by Sinha Danse from Montreal When: Today at 6.45 pm Where: Jorasanko Thakurbari

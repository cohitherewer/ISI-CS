                                                                                                               Rock rage at IIT gala
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The Led Zeppelica performance at Spring Fest                                  
	Guitar riffs and drum solos, instead of alarm clocks, woke up IIT Kharagpur students for the final time this year on Sunday as the golden jubilee edition of Spring Fest, with The Telegraph as media partner, drew to a close.         
	The social-cultural festival that started on Thursday with an Odissi performance by a troupe from Bhubaneswar turned the campus into a school of rock.        
	Fifty-five bands from in and around Calcutta and the Northeast belted out their best at Wildfire, the biggest amateur rock band competition in eastern India. Cassinis Division, a city-based alternative rock band, crowned Moshpit, also from Calcutta, the champions.        
	The Spring Fest Championship was the other top draw of the event that brought over 5,000 students from 80 colleges to town. The team from NIT, Durgapur, won the trophy.         
	The golden jubilee special was Kharagshetra, a personality contest modelled on MTV Roadies. The 10 finalists from 200 participants had to perform in front a 4,000 strong crowd and judges VJ Ayushman, fashion designer Abhishek Dutta and Miss India 2006 Vibhinita Varma.         
	Performances by KK and Led Zeppelin cover band Led Zeppelica had people clambering on trees outside the open-air theatre for a glimpse of the action.        
	India Jazz Suites, a collaboration between Kathak dancer Pandit Chitresh Das and Emmy award winning tap dancer Jason Samuel Smith, was also a hit.        
	The main arena, decorated keeping in mind the theme of the fest, El Dorado  The Golden City, saw students try out their moves on the dance floor, check their rock climbing skills and perform in impromptu events in Frolico Holic.        
	A headbangers ball featuring back-to-back performances by the finalists of Wildfire and Cassinis Division brought the curtains down on four days of fun and frolic.

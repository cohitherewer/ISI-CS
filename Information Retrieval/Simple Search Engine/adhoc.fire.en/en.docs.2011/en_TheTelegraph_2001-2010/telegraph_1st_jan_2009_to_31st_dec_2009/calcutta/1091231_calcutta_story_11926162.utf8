                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Sons murder most foul
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Anjana Maity cooked egg-noodles for her 14-year-old son Somenath hours before she hacked him to death at their Thakurpukur home early on Tuesday, police said.        
	On Monday, the woman and her son returned from her parents house in East Midnapore. It seems the murder was preplanned, said an officer working on the case.        
	Anjana, who chopped off her sons head, fingers and genitals with a bonti, has been remanded in judicial custody. The cops suspect she attacked her son when he was asleep.        
	The accused told the police during interrogation that she had a sleepless night on Monday. The doctors who conducted the post-mortem said the boy had been killed between 3 and 4am, said an officer of Thakurpukur police station. The post-mortem also revealed that the boy had dinner between 10 and 11pm. The sleuths visited Anjanas house and prepared a list of furniture and other articles.        
	Senior officers doubt whether there is any other instance of a mother killing her child in recent history.        
	Psychologist Mahua Ghosh said: There is no doubt that Anjana Maity had lost her mental balance. We need to find out why she became so aggressive. One cannot rule out the possibility that the act was a manifestation of the torture, physical or sexual, that she might have gone through.

                      Myth in modern art                    An intense attraction to traditional and classical Indian art has inspired Aloke Kumar Paul into this realm. In his childhood, he would make puppets using clay, straw, paper and wood. His interest shifted to painting as he grew older, but his fascination for clay models and colours has remained. Over the years, Paul has experimented with different styles, media and subjects. His works are characterised by the new trend of internalisation of tradition, reverberating the distant echo of our mythical past but displaying a technique of presentation that reflects contemporary fervour. Symphony of Life, the ongoing solo show of his paintings, showcases mixed media works in acrylic, dry pastel, ink and oil, where he deconstructs the myths of the Buddha and Jataka stories. Buddha is often constructed as a mythical structure of consecrated silence. One side of his face is luminous, expressing divine serenity, while the other side is darkened, reflecting the burden of a life full of turmoil and strife. Through this load of monolithic comparison and contradiction, the artist builds up a critique of contemporary globalised existence. Lucid and serious, his works inculcate traditional sources and draw upon personal experiences. He builds a tragic consciousness through fragmentation of structural surfaces, and from the wisdom and profundity of a mythical past tries to construct a requiem for the present.

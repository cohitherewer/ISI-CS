The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Forensic team in death house
                                                                                                               Forensic team in death house
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A forensic team on Wednesday visited the Haridevpur house where all four inhabitants were found dead on Monday morning and collected blood samples and finger prints from the floors, beds and the walls.        
	The two-member forensic team also collected some documents from the house before sealing the first-floor room where Mridul Kanti Das, 63, was found hanging.        
	The investigation has so far revealed that Mridul had killed his wife and daughter and a 94-year-old member of his family before committing suicide. But we cannot be certain about the sequence of events till we get the forensic reports, said Ajey Ranade, the superintendent of South 24- Parganas police.        
	The cops believe Nibha was the first person to have been murdered on Sunday night, followed by daughter Anindita and maternal uncle Anil. Our suspicion is based on an analysis of the victims blood samples. The forensic team has to confirm it, said an investigating officer.        
	The cops are also examining Aninditas office bag and other belongings, including her diaries. The 26-year-old worked with a private bank. The sleuths are also trying to find out whether Mridul or Anindita had made any substantial investment.        
	An officer of Thakurpukur police station said: The main gate of the house was locked from the inside, which rules out the possibility of any outsiders involvement in the crime. But we havent found any concrete motive behind the murders.        
	Mridul was found hanging by a towel from the ceiling fan of his first-floor bedroom. Wife Nibha was found lying on the bed in her ground-floor room, with wounds on her neck. The bodies of Anindita and the nonagenarian, whose face was caked with blood, were found in an adjoining room.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Flood warning with rain

	Calcutta braced for the return of an old monsoon headache  waterlogging  after just a few spells of heavy rain left several streets under water and the weatherman warned of widespread showers in the next 48 hours.        
	The city received 48.4mm of rain on Monday, thanks to a cyclonic circulation over Gangetic Bengal.         
	We expect heavy rain to persist over the next 24 to 48 hours, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	While the rain forecast held out hope for comfortable weather, citizens frowned at the sight of waterlogged streets in several pockets of south Calcutta. Samrat Dutta, a 26-year-old sales engineer with a private company, said he shuddered to think what people would face if it rained like a normal monsoon.         
	There was hardly any rain on Monday and streets across central Calcutta were waterlogged. If this is a sign of things to come, we would rather not have heavy rain, he said.        
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) claimed that ankle-deep water in some localities did not mean waterlogging. What parts of the city experienced on Monday was not waterlogging. It was just roadside stagnation, an official said.         
	So what caused the stagnation?        
	Water stagnated because the gully pits were clogged. The accumulated water receded as soon as the pits were cleared, the official explained.        
	Beautician Ailamon Kharaspa, who had to wade through slushy water to reach her workplace off Elgin Road, scoffed at the CMCs explanation.         
	What is the difference between stagnation of water and waterlogging? the 24-year-old asked.        
	With more showers being forecast, the civic authorities have decided to deploy additional workers to clean the choked gully pits.         
	We have also alerted all our pumping stations to the possibility of waterlogging if it rains heavily for several hours at a stretch, said Amit Kumar Roy, the chief engineer of the CMCs drainage and sewerage wing.        
	Officials admitted that a weak monsoon this year had spared the civic body a lot of trouble.         
	We havent been stretched this monsoon because there has been virtually no rain. But Monday showed that the challenge of waterlogging is not over yet, an official said.        
	Cloud imagery from the satellite Kalpana-1 at 2.30pm on Monday showed convective formations over north and adjoining central Bay of Bengal, which together with the cyclonic circulation could trigger sustained heavy rain rather than a few short bursts.        
	The city has been experiencing scattered rainfall over the past couple of weeks.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A   noble gloom
                                                                            Sunday , November 8 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            A   noble gloom
                              A photograph at the exhibition. (Pradip Sanyal)                                  
	Calcutta is a source of endless irritation for its inhabitants. With its potholed alleys, dug-up roads, crumbling buildings and never-to-be-finished flyovers, it may even look like a bombed city to foreigners. But when captured in black-and-white film, the sorry mess somehow takes on a poetic aspect, combining noble gloom with quaint distinction.         
	The exhibition of black-and-white photographs that opened at Studio 21 on Friday features the work of Sumit Basu, Jayanta Saha, Kushal Ray, Nilanjan Ray and Saibal Das. The common thread running through this show, Home and the Street, curated by the British photographer Christopher Taylor, is Calcutta  the inner and outer lives of the city.         
	Sumit Basus camera, for instance, pans on the artist Shuvaprasanna at work, or on Shanu Lahiri, dwarfed by the furniture and books around her. From enclosed spaces, Basus eye moves outward, catching a pair of athletes practising, although they seem to be tenderly holding each others hands.         
	Kushal Ray focuses on the everyday drama of an old Calcutta household, presided over by Muni the matriarch, whose wizened face brings to mind Indir Thakurun. Jayanta Saha is drawn to the interplay of tradition and modernity: a lone helmet lies on a chair in a palatial, but dilapidated, mansion.         
	There is a touch of the sinister in the disturbing perspectives of Saibal Das. The charak performer, in one of his works, could well have been hanging by the noose. Apart from scenes of Durga puja in Calcutta, the widows of Varanasi feature in Nilanjan Rays photographs.                     SOMAK GHOSHAL

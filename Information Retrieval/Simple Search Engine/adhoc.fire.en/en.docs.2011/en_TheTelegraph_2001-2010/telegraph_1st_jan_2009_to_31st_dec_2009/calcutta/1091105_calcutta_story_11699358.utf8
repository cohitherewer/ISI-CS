The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cell therapy for ulcers
                                                                            Thursday , November 5 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Cell therapy for ulcers
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	A breakthrough in the treatment of diabetic ulcers could be on our doorstep.         
	CordLife, Asia-Pacifics largest network of stem cell banks, which gave Calcutta its first full umbilical cord blood tissue processing and storage facility near Joka, announced the launch of the most advanced umbilical cord banking technology in India on Wednesday.        
	This technology has the ability to isolate two cell types to help hasten the healing of general and diabetic foot ulcers or repair injured tissues and organs, according to stem cell therapy experts.        
	With over 41 million diabetics in India and one in every six of them estimated to have an ulcer during their lifetime, CordLifes umbilical cord banking technology will help to harvest the right and important stem cells that may prevent amputations, said Steven Fang, the group CEO, CordLife Ltd.        
	CordLife Sciences India Pvt Ltd, a subsidiary of the Singapore-headquartered CordLife, will offer collection and storage of umbilical cord stem cells as a value-added service for all its cord blood banking customers over a limited period at its Joka facility, according to company officials.        
	We have tracked the progress of an 82-year-old male patient with severe diabetic foot ulcers who was treated with stem cells and after 45 days, he showed remarkable improvement, with the wound healing substantially, said Prosanto Chowdhury, the medical director of CordLife Sciences India.        
	Epithelial stem cells have the potential to rejuvenate skin and mucus membranes to treat non-healing wounds, especially diabetic ulcers. Typically, diabetic ulcers are very difficult to heal. With epithelial stem cells, the ulcers can be healed within 45 days, declared Meghnath Roy Chowdhury, the managing director of CordLife Sciences India.        
	Doctors in the city are buoyant, but not sure whether widespread application is possible soon. The theoretical potential of such treatment is huge. However, we have to closely watch the results of clinical trials before holding out hope to our patients. Besides, acceptance will depend largely on the cost-effectiveness of the therapy, pointed out city-based endocrinologist Subhankar Chowdhury.        
	The company is now in the process of identifying prominent institutions and specialist physicians to provide the application of epithelial stem cells on diabetic patients. Recent studies have shown adult stem cells can also be used to treat autoimmune diseases.

                                                                                                               Battle of brains
                              Participants fight it out at Quizzit, the quiz contest organised at Infocom. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                            
	The seventh edition of Quizzit  presented by Cognizant in association with Texas Instruments and IERCEM Institute of Information Technology, Banipur  saw five rounds of tough quizzing by the 12 finalists. Held at Infocom 2008-09, the four-day quiz ended with the finals on January 18. Giri Balasubramaniam, known as Pick Brain in the quiz circuit, conducted the finals.        
	The prelims were held in Siliguri, Jamshedpur, Ranchi, Bhubaneswar, Haldia and Durgapur, apart from Calcutta. In the megafinal, four contestants from other cities fought it out with eight from Calcutta.        
	Questions ranging from entertainment, history, music to sports tested the seasoned quizzers. In the For Your Eyes Only section, for example, participants were asked to identify a set of logos that were rejected ones from Barack Obamas presidential election campaign.        
	Gautam Ghosh, the director of International School of Business and Media, secured the first position, followed by Ashad M. Siddiqui and Devarshi Ghosh. I was cautious not to throw away points this time, said Ghosh, who has been participating for the past two years. Arnab Ghosh, a Class X student from Jamshedpur, was the youngest finalist.        
	The audience pitched in with answers too. Every correct answer bagged a prize.        
	The winner took home an LCD television and an iPod. The first runner-up won a home theatre system and an iPod Nano, while the second runner-up won a digital camera and an iPod Nano. All three received gift vouchers from Starmark.        
	Quizzit adds entertainment for visitors at Infocom. Over the years it has become a highly popular event, said an organiser.

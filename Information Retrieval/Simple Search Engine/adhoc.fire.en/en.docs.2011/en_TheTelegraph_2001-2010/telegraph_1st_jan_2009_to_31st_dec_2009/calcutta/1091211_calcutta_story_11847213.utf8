The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Praise and rap in CU report card
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Praise and rap in CU report card
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Calcutta University                                  
	An inspection team from the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) on Thursday praised Calcutta University (CU) for its efforts in maintaining high academic and teaching standards despite several constraints but hauled up the 153-year-old institution for failing to improve facilities for students.         
	CU outshone many other universities in the country in certain parameters. For example, the universitys performance in nanotechnology research is outstanding, said S.P. Thyagrajan, the chairman of the eight-member team.        
	But he said CU needed to work harder to improve the condition of student hostels, canteens and common rooms. The university has eight campuses. Inter-campus transport facilities must be started to help students travel from one campus to another, said Thyagrajan. He added that CU needed to modernise its examination system to prevent delays in publishing results.        
	The NAAC team inspected all eight CU campuses in the past four days for re-accrediting the university. During the first NAAC accreditation in 2001, CU had got a five-star rating, the highest.        
	Senior professors of reputable institutions across the country, including Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi University and Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, were part of the inspection team.         
	Speaking of the constraints faced by CU, Valerian Roderigues of JNU said: A state-aided university has to focus more on the state for recruitment of teachers and student enrolment. Calcutta University is not lagging behind JNU in many respects if we consider the number of constraints it has to face for being a state university.         
	Institutes like JNU enjoy certain privileges like drawing their faculty from across the country and the world and admitting the best brains from all over India.         
	CU vice-chancellor Suranjan Das admitted that the panel had pointed out certain shortcomings of the university, but according to him, the team also praised the university for imparting high standards of education in all faculties appreciated the functioning of the nanotechnology department and the institute of social sciences.         
	The team submitted a preliminary report to the university before leaving for Bangalore, the NAAC headquarters. The panel will submit its final report to the NAAC shortly, after which the rating will be accorded.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A beacon here and a beacon there
                                                                                                               A beacon here and a beacon there
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                                            
	Everyone wants a beacon light.        
	Two years after a government notification made beacon lights available to many of its officials, another group, mainly senior officials of the judicial services, is now clamouring for the status symbol.        
	Following a petition by advocate Subroto Mookherjee, the division bench of Justice K.J. Sengupta and Justice M.A. Ghani on Monday directed the state government to inform the court what steps it had taken to include the registrar-general of Calcutta High Court, district judges and the chief and additional chief judicial magistrates on the beacon list.        
	While hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) in 2007, the high court had asked why the state was not taking action against those flouting beacon-use norms. The advocate-general had then submitted a gazette notification dated September 7, 2007, showing that it had included more than 100 dignitaries in the beacon list.        
	The governments beacon benevolence seems to have boomeranged now.        
	After receiving a stricture from the court in 2007, the government had hurriedly prepared the list. That decision has put the government in a fix. Now, it will have to expand the list further, said advocate Idris Ali, who had filed the PIL.        
	The way claimants for beacon lights are going up, very soon we will reach a situation where a majority of cars will be flashing them.... This is a bizarre situation and the government is responsible for the chaos, said advocate Sailendu Rakshit.        
	Following Mondays order, the state government will have to file an affidavit before the court within two weeks clarifying why the district magistrates can use a beacon light if the district judges cannot. Both belong to the same category, argued the petitioner.         
	Prior to September 2007, not even the commissioner of Calcutta Police was entitled to use a beacon light. But following the gazette notification, even the deputy commissioners of police enjoyed the right, along with chiefs of various commissions and tribunals, mayors and deputy mayors of civic bodies and even zilla parishad sabhadipatis. On the administrative side, all principal secretaries were allowed to flash the light.        
	The beacon brigade is entitled to special treatment on the streets, as we have to clear the path for them. This adds to the traffic chaos, said an officer of the traffic department. Ideally, only ambulances and police vehicles on emergency duty should be allowed the use of beacon lights, he added.

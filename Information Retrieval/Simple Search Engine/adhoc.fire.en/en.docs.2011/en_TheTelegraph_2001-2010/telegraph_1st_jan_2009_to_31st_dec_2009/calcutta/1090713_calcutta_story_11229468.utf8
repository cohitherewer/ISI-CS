                      In memory of the maestro who made movies                    Bimal Roy, one of the greatest ever directors of Indian cinema, was born in 1909. He entered the realm of movies as a cameraman with New Theatres Pvt. Ltd. The Silent Master ushered in the golden age of Indian cinema in the 1940s. A socially committed director, Roys films had the power to inspire and move audiences. His films reveal a romantic idealist to whom any form of exploitation  social, religious or economic was unacceptable. He made about 21 full-length feature films, both in Bengali and Hindi, of which Do Bigha Zameen (a still from the film, far right) made 50 years ago, is an eloquent portrait of displaced peasants. The film made a strong universal impact for its humane portrayal of Indian peasantry. It is considered one of the 10 best Indian films of all time. It has the additional distinction of being one of the first Indian movies to win awards and accolades: in China, UK, Karlovi Vary, Cannes, USSR, Venice and Melbourne. Satyajit Ray Film amp; Television Institute and Tapan Sinha Foundation jointly host Roys birth cenetnary programme, Remembering Bimal Roy, with lectures by Dilip Sircar, Debalina Mazumdar, Buddhadev Dasgupta and Ratnottama Sengupta on the master and his creations, to be followed by screening of the documentary, Remembering Bimal Roy, and Roys feature film, Do Bigha Zameen.

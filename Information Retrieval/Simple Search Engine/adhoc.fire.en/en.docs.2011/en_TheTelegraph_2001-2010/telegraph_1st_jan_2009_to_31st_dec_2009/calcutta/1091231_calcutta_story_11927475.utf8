The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Talk of the town in a year of change   Lets talk about the weather and more
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Talk of the town in a year of change       - Calcutta had a lot to chatter about in 2009                                                
	From paribartaner hawa to price rise, fashion weeks to marmoset theft  Calcuttans had a lot on their adda table this year. Metro picks the top talking points of 2009  of, from and by the city  in random order.        
	Aila        
	Cyclone Aila stormed through town on May 25, leaving a trail of uprooted trees and electricity poles. Citizens went without power and water for up to 90 hours with the civic body taking over a week just to clear the debris. Elsewhere in Bengal, the cyclone at 120kmph claimed 138 lives and rendered lakhs homeless.        
	Paribartan        
	Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress rode the paribartaner hawa (winds of change) in Bengal to wrest 14 of the 42 seats from the Left Front in the Lok Sabha election. From autos to airports, this has given Calcuttans the all-important question to chew on  will she, wont she? She being Mamata, will being her conquest of Writers Buildings in 2011.        
	Price rise        
	Aila, monsoon and inflation combined to erode the Calcuttans earnings in 2009. Prices of essential commodities started heading northwards in summer and shot through the roof by the end of the year, sending household budgets haywire.        
	Red bus, green auto        
	A high court ban on polluting vehicles paved the way for a transport facelift. Finally. Katatel-powered autos made way for many green, LPG three-wheelers, while several fume-spewing, rickety buses were replaced with swanky, low-floor vehicles that made breathing easier and commuting smoother.        
	Star guests        
	Bolly stars shone bright in Calcutta through the year  from the Khan-daan of Shah Rukh, Aamir and Salman to Bong bombshells Rani Mukerji, Bipasha Basu and Sushmita Sen. Leading lady Katrina Kaif made more than one visit, while Aishwarya Rai and Abhishek Bachchan set up base in the city to shoot for Mani Ratnams Raavan. The cherry on the star-spangled cake: Hollywood brat Lindsay Lohans hush-hush charity visit earlier this month.                                
	Vedic Village         
	If Ash-Abhis recommendation following their stay at this luxury spa resort made it the weekend retreat of choice, a football match, a gunshot and a blaze a few months later left Vedic Village as well as its reputation gutted. The resort has reopened but its promoter, Raj Modi, and land deals in Rajarhat are under the scanner.        
	Sourav vs Buchanan        
	The Kolkata Knight Riders plumbed the depths in IPL 2 with coach John Buchanan playing the multiple-captain card to sideline Sourav Ganguly in South Africa. Buchanan soon retired hurt, while Dada got his timing back  and later the captaincy  with the TV show Dadagiri Unlimited.         
	Marmoset        
	The theft of eight rare Brazilian monkeys the size of sewer rats from Alipore zoo in August added the word marmoset to the Calcuttans lexicon. Seven were recovered, but the cops showed butter fingers when it came to keeping the masterminds in custody.        
	Fashion week        
	Calcutta hosted its first fashion week in April, followed by another five months later, with M.S. Dhoni as brand ambassador. Both were successes with big-ticket designers (Manish Malhotra, Rohit Bal) and A-line showstoppers (John Abraham, Bipasha Basu).                    
	Weather        
	Heat wave-like conditions in April, May and June with a cyclone and a weak monsoon thrown in, an unusually hot November and the coldest December this decade  freakish patterns gave Calcuttans enough reason to talk about the weather.         
	Metro rail        
	The citys transport lifeline finally reached Garia Bazar (Kavi Nazrul) in August but also turned into a snag-a-day service with its decades-old infrastructure showing signs of wear and tear, A spate of suicides on the tracks compounded Metro Railways problems.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Job skip to script success in slump
                                                                                                               Job skip to script success in slump
  - Many students intend sitting out campus placements to try being their own bosses          A STAFF REPORTER                                                  
	The Class of 2009 would rather ride the recession than ride it out.         
	Scores of engineering and business management students will skip campus placements this year, aiming to strike out on their own and script the rare success stories of the downturn.         
	Its been done before. Microsoft, Walt Disney Company and General Motors were all launched in the midst of economic gloom. Your chance of success actually depends on what domain you are getting into, says Mayank Jain, who graduated from IIT Kharagpur last year but opted for deferred placement to test his entrepreneurship skills.         
	Mayank and three other IITians launched Intinno Technologies, an e-learning platform that extends the classroom experience beyond the campus. Education is not going to be hit by slowdown. During a downturn people tend to turn more towards education, which makes this the best time for us to hit the market, he says.         
	Karan Walia, a second-year student of NSHM Knowledge Campus, started his brokerage and consultancy company in October 2007 and has struggled so far. But he has no intention of giving up on the venture and take up the first job that comes his way in campus interviews. I will perhaps continue to struggle, but I also believe this is the best time to prove that you and your company have what it takes to survive and succeed, says Karan.         
	With companies squeezing their recruitment budgets and dream jobs hard to come by, student entrepreneurs believe they have little to lose by rejecting an employment opportunity. Those at the IIT have the advantage of sitting for campus interviews even two years later under the deferred placement programme should any of their ventures fail.         
	Rajat Sethi, a final-year IITian, has opted for the scheme to try his hand in a carbon technology-based business, Codegreen. His business partners Prateek Bumb and Aniruddh Sharma, both third-year students, have decided to do likewise when their turn comes next year. Ours is a first-of-its-kind venture. We have created a technology than can extract 97 per cent carbon dioxide from any industrial plant instead of the standard 78 per cent, says Bumb.        
	Not just students, even some young working executives are toying with start-up ideas. According to American business consultant Douglass Tatum, who was in town recently, capable people who have lost their jobs can prosper if they start businesses they are familiar with. Operation costs are less in times like these and the new businesses started by these people might end up servicing the very companies that had sacked them, says Tatum.

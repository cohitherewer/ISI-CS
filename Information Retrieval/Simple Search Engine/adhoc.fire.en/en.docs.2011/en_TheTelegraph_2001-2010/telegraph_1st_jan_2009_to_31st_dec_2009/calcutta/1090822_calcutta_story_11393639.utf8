	The topic, Recession is not a Reality, assured a lively volley of arguments. Said Saugat Upadhyay, a first-year student of BBA at JD Birla, for the motion: Recession is more a state of the mind than of the market. Archies Gallery registered a 15 per cent growth rate this year. Would that happen if we were in a recession? he asked.

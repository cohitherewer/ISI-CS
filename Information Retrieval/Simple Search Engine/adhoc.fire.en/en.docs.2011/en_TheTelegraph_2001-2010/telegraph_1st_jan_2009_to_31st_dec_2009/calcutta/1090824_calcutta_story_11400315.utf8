The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | AshAbhi abode set ablaze
                                                                                                               AshAbhi abode set ablaze
          A STAFF REPORTER                                  The stretch between the club house and the spa up in flames at Vedic Village ; a car at the roundabout ravaged by mob fury; the poolside as a ring of fire. (Bishwarup Dutta and Amit Datta)                                 
	Thank you for a wonderful treatment. Cant wait to come back for my next one. Love  Abhishek Bachchan.        
	If the Bachchan beta returns in a hurry to the Sanjeeva Spa at Vedic Village, where he had penned this message in March, he will be in for a shock.        
	The spa was on the casualty list in the luxury resort off Rajarhat after a dispute in a nearby football match sparked a blaze that swept through Vedic Village.        
	If Abhishek seemed determined to be back, his wife seemed to have given her heart to the spa resort that was her home for three weeks while shooting for Mani Ratnams Raavan in the spring of 2009.        
	Thank you so much for such a relaxing treatment. Our best wishes to you and your staff  Ash had written, complete with a big heart in blue ink, after a pamper session at the spa. But the straight-from-the heart wishes of the Bollywood beauty could do little to save Vedic Village from mob fury on Sunday.        
	A crowd raided the luxury spa resort and torched parts of the property, making a mockery of its calling card, discover the richness of rural India... where the concrete form and the rural fuse in magnificent harmony.        
	Harmony turned to horror within minutes of madness as panic-stricken residents and employees raced out of the spa and other rooms of the resort.        
	Our immediate reaction was to find our torches to make our way out of the farmhouse. No one was around and it was pitch dark. Only after the police and fire brigade arrived did we feel things had cooled down. My nine-year-old daughter was scared and as soon as we could get our car out, we left for our Salt Lake residence, said Bhawna Shah, owner of a farmhouse.        
	The liberal use of thatch and other return-to-nature materials fanned the flames, rued the firemen as 10 engines battled the blaze.        
	On entering Vedic Village on Sunday evening, Metro spotted a farmhouse to the right and a farmhouse to the left up in flames.        
	One of them had been marked for Durga puja celebrations, mumbled an official of the resort, too stunned to dwell on the aftermath.        
	The main roundabout led to a mangled car, a precursor to the damage beyond. Large parts of the club house with the main reception area, conference rooms, library and games room (with pool, table tennis, carrom, air hockey and board games) were aflame.        
	Past the clubhouse, there was little respite as the roofs and rooms bordering the poolside were all ablaze.        
	The Lakeside Villa that was home to AshAbhi not so long ago appeared safe, but so many other parts of the resort they had spent time in were being reduced to rubble.        
	Its really sad what happened today, said Subir Chanda, the chief co-ordinator for the city leg of the Raavan shoot. We had specifically chosen the spa resort because it has so much of green and is isolated. Aishwarya and Abhishek quite enjoyed their stay here, he added.        
	If relaxed and rejuvenated is how Bollywoods power couple had defined their stay at Vedic Village, ravaged and scorched was what it was reduced to on Sunday night.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | All the world comes to school
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      All the world comes to school

	It was an evening to remember for the many expatriates who gathered at La Martiniere School for Girls on Human Rights Day on December 10 to share their traditions. While Brazilian Edwan Carvalho, on a football contract in the city, demonstrated his dribbling skills, Nigerians Soloman Udoka and Paul Chibnenji presented the traditional dance of the African Ebo tribe and Russian Larisa Petronova, married to a Calcuttan, recited a poem she had written in Bengali.         
	The focus of the day was to stand up against discrimination of all kinds and the need to embrace diversity. Said Principal Hilda Peacock: Human rights is not an issue that we should remember only for one day in a year. We must be willing to extend our help to those who face discrimination throughout the year.        
	The idea arose by way of the International School Award programme organised by British Council, said vice principal Rupkatha Sarkar. We got in touch with consulates of various countries and sent them invitations. But we didnt expect such an overwhelming response, she smiled.         
	For the visitors to the city, who varied from NGO workers, students to football players, the day afforded a chance to mingle with those from other parts of the world. Speaking to the lady from the US, I found that both of us were Christians. We talked about our way of worship, said 37-year-old Chibnenji, who is studying electronic and computer programming at the Indian Institute of Job-Oriented Training.         
	It was like a mini world within the four walls of the school. We might have read about them or seen them on television, but watching the performances first hand and interacting with the performers was quite an experience, said a Class VII student of La Martiniere.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Smoke alarm in Metro
                                                                                                               Smoke alarm in Metro
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Smoke from burning tyres blew into the Rabindra Sadan Metro station platform and a Dum Dum-bound train through the tunnel on Friday afternoon, triggering fire alarms and a blackout that panicked passengers.         
	Metro officials switched off power at the station within seconds of the train pulling in around 3.20pm. The coaches and the platform were shrouded in dark smoke.        
	Passengers panicked and ran out of the train in darkness. Some rushed out of the station while most waited on the platform. Fearing a blaze, officials called in a fire tender.        
	A check, however, revealed that nothing was wrong with the train and it continued on its journey after seven minutes.        
	We were very scared when the fire alarms rang out. Soon the lights were switched off, said Nayan Banerjee, a passenger.        
	Our compartment was filled with smoke and my little daughter was choking. We somehow managed to get out of the train. We waited on the platform but many others ran out of the station, said another passenger.        
	The passengers were apprehensive partly because smoke and sparks have been common in Metro over the past two months.        
	According to station officials, some passengers sustained minor injuries in the rush to reach a safe spot.        
	Smoke from burnt tyres had entered the tunnel near Rabindra Sadan station through a ventilation inlet. We blew away the smoke with exhaust fans and restored normal services, said J.K. Mitra, the chief operating officer of Metro Railways.        
	Metro later found some garage owners burning used tyres near adjacent park, close to the ventilation fan that sucked in smoke.

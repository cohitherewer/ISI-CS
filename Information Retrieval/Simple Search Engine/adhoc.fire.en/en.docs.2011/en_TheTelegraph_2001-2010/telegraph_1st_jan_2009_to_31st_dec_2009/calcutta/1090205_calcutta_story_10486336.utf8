                                                                                                               Theft amp; rap shadow on store suicide
          A STAFF REPORTER                           The 22 Camac Street shopping landmark                                  
	A suicide in the Camac Street outlet of Pantaloons on Tuesday led to the slapping of an abetment charge on some employees of the Future Groups store.        
	We have started a case under IPC sections 306 and 34 (abetment to suicide and acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) against some employees, said Rajesh Subarno, the deputy commissioner of police (south).        
	Mrityunjoy Ghosh, an employee of an Entally-based firm which Pantaloon Retail India Ltd has hired for loading and unloading goods, was found hanging in the third-floor store of 22 Camac Street on Tuesday afternoon.        
	Relatives of the 52-year-old claimed that Ghosh had killed himself after some store staff members rebuked and threatened him for allegedly stealing a mustard oil pouch the previous night.        
	A Pantaloon spokesman denied the charge.        
	Company insiders said guards had caught Ghosh leaving the store late on Monday night with the pouch, which they alleged he had lifted from the Food Bazaar counter on the third floor.        
	The guards did not make it an issue then and allowed Ghosh to go home. When he turned up the next morning, they asked him to talk to the managers who were then busy in a meeting, said store manager Ekalabya Neogy.        
	Company officials said Ghosh disappeared after waiting for some time. He was found hanging in the Air Handling Unit of the store around 3.30pm. He was taken to a nursing home, where he was declared dead on arrival.        
	Relatives of the Sonarpur resident alleged that some guards had confessed to them that Ghosh had been taken to the store where he was severely rebuked and threatened with dire consequences.        
	Fearing arrest, he hanged himself, said a relative.        
	Ghoshs elder son Monojit lodged a complaint with Shakespeare Sarani police station. Someone from the store called me around 12.30pm on Tuesday and said that my father had committed a theft. When I went there, I was taken to a nursing home and told that my father had committed suicide, Monojit said.

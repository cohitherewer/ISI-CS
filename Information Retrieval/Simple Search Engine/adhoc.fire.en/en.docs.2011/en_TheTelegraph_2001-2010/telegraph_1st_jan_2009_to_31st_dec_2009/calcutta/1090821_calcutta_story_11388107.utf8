The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tease probe draws a blank
                                                                                                               Tease probe draws a blank
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Police are still clueless about the identity of the three youths who harassed school girls in a pool car and shot at the driver in Metiabruz on Tuesday morning.        
	Our officers are conducting raids but no one has been arrested yet, said Asit Pal, the deputy commissioner of police (port). Sources said officers from the detective department were helping Garden Reach police station in probing the case.        
	Police artists are drawing sketches of the bike-borne youths based on inputs provided by the girls.        
	The sketches will be distributed to local residents. But we suspect the trio have fled the area, said an investigating officer.        
	C.L. Singh, the headmaster of Keshoram Cotton Mills High School, where the girls study, met senior officers of the port division of the city police on Thursday to enquire about the status of the case.        
	Its surprising that the police are clueless about the youths more than 48 hours after the incident, Singh said. We cannot feel safe till they are put behind bars. They might come back and attack the girls again, said Singh.        
	A senior officer at Lalbazar admitted the trio would have been arrested by now had the cops been more prompt. The jurisdiction factor resulted in the delay and the three youths managed to escape.        
	The school is under the jurisdiction of Metiabruz police of South 24-Parganas while the road leading to it is manned by the Garden Reach cops of the city force.         
	Officers of both forces blamed one another when Metro asked them on Wednesday why no action was taken on the school authorities pleas over the past two years for intensified patrolling in the neighbourhood.        
	The day after, however, witnessed a change, with the officers of Metiabruz and Garden Reach police stations jointly organising patrols around the school.        
	The pool car driver, Vinod Kumar Jaiswara, is out of danger though he is still under observation at SSKM Hospital.

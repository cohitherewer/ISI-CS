The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | PG rush for durwan post
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      PG rush for durwan post
  - Half of 3.5 lakh applicants for unskilled jobs overqualified          MITA MUKHERJEE                                    
	A deluge of postgraduate applicants for the posts of lower division clerks, junior assistants, sweepers, liftmen and durwans have left the Calcutta University (CU) authorities struggling to select the candidates for 200-odd vacancies.        
	Over 50 per cent of the 3.5-lakh applicants have postgraduate degrees and many of them were students of CU. It is a difficult task to select candidates for these unskilled jobs from a pool of such overqualified applicants, said a senior CU official, underlining the enormity of the problem of joblessness in Bengal.        
	According to CU norms, Indian citizens who have cleared the Class XII board examination are eligible for the posts of lower division clerk or junior assistant, those who have studied till Class VIII are eligible for durwan and liftman, while there is no required qualification for sweepers.        
	CU filled around 200 such posts in 2003 from a pool of less than 25,000 applicants, said a university source.        
	But it was a different story this time. Waves and waves of applicants hit the College Street campus to submit their application forms. We have never received applications of such numbers and nature for these posts. This mirrors the gravity of the unemployment problem in the state, said a senior CU official.         
	The Telegraph had on October 13 reported that nearly 10 lakh candidates had submitted applications to appear for an entrance test, to be conducted by the Public Service Commission, to fill up 4,013 Group-D vacancies in various government departments.         
	One cannot demean any category of work, but what worries me is the trend of educated youths applying for such low-skill jobs, said a retired professor of CU.        
	According to him, if a postgraduate student is selected as a durwan or a lower division clerk, it casts a shadow on the image of the university.         
	But 29-year-old Alok Mukherjee (name changed) from Barasat cannot afford to worry about the image of the 150-year-old university or the lacunae in the system that has forced the CU postgraduate to apply for the post of a durwan.         
	I will be happy if I can manage even the job of a durwan in CU because I need a secure job, said Mukherjee, who has a temporary accountants job in a wholesale garment shop in Burrabazar with a monthly salary of Rs 2,500.         
	According to him, the CU job is a lucrative proposition as he will earn around Rs 9,000 a month. Following the recent pay hike, the salaries of lower division clerks have increased from Rs 8,000 (approx) per month to Rs 13,000 (approx).

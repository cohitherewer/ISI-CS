The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Auto-cracy on streets of city   Commuters forced to get off green vehicles
                                                                                                               Auto-cracy on streets of city     Commuters forced to get off green vehicles
          A STAFF REPORTER                              Auto operators stop a green three-wheeler near the 8B bus stand in Jadavpur on Monday morning; (below) a youth ferries two commuters on his motorcycle from Kudghat to Tollygunge for a price.

	They wouldnt follow the law, and threatened those who followed it.         
	The city witnessed autocracy of a different kind on Monday morning with the two-stroke brigade waylaying green three-wheelers and buses, intimidating the drivers and forcing the passengers to get off.         
	Amader bachhara khete pachhena aar tora auto chalachhis? Ekhuni side kor nahole bhenge debo (Our children have nothing to eat and you are plying your autos? Stop right now or we will destroy the vehicles), shouted a member of the Inttuc-affiliated union, stopping a green auto near the 8B bus stand in Jadavpur.         
	Stranded passengers could do little but walk away.         
	This is terrible. The transport system is already in a mess because of poor planning and these men are heaping more misery on commuters by not allowing the legal autos to ply, said 65-year-old Sangita Burman, a resident of Jadavpur stranded on the way to her daughters house at Deshapriya Park.         
	Muscle-flexing by two-stroke operators ensured that the auto stands in Tollygunge, Naktala, Jadavpur and the Prince Anwar Shah connector were empty during the morning and late afternoon peak hours.         
	I was returning to my stand at Bondel Gate after an LPG refill at a pump on Prince Anwar Shah Road when a group of auto drivers stopped me near Jadavpur police station, dragged me out of the vehicle and asked why I was on the road. They let me go only after I assured them that I was not from their route and would return home from there, said driver Kamal Saha.         
	Auto operators in Jadavpur did not spare even state buses. It was sheer hooliganism. The driver of the bus I had taken was threatened with dire consequences if he returned to the area, said a passenger.         
	In north Calcutta, Citu flags fluttered atop two-stroke autos and some drivers demanded more than the normal fare. An auto driver on the Nagerbazar-Dum Dum route said he and others who hadnt yet switched to four-stroke LPG mode were guaranteed immunity during an informal meeting with police officers on Sunday night.         
	The absence of police personnel along the entire stretch  among the busier auto zones of the city  buttressed his claim.         
	According to a union member, only 20 per cent of the 387 registered autos that ply on the route have converted to four-stroke LPG.         
	We are trying to convince the rest to switch to LPG mode. But we cannot suspend operations because a lot of people depend on us to get to work and get back home, said Jogesh Hazra, a member of the Nagerbazar-Dum Dum Auto Union.         
	At Ultadanga, auto drivers were seen demanding up to five times the usual fare and getting it.         
	Given the circumstances, commuters have no choice but to pay what the drivers demand. There are fewer buses on the road and autos are the quickest mode of communication between short distances, said Bhaswati Mukherjee, a schoolteacher from Bowbazar.         
	Student Shiuli Ghosh blamed the government for the transport mess.         
	The idea is to harass commuters. The government and the transport lobby think that citizens will ultimately ask for all vehicles to be back on the road if they continue to be harassed in this manner.

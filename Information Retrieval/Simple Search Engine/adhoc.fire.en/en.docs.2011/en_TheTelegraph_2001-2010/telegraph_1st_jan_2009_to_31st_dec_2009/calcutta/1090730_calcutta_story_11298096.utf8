	Students taking Madhyamik 2012 will have to write the tests only on the Class X syllabus. The West Bengal Board of Secondary Education on Wednesday accepted the governments proposal to split the Madhyamik syllabi.        
	Under the existing system, students are assessed on the combined syllabi of classes IX and X.         
	The board had convened a special meeting on Wednesday to discuss the implementation of the government order on splitting the Madhyamik course. The board members, including representatives of universities, the HS council and school teachers, took a unanimous decision to introduce the split in 2012, said board secretary Partha Ray.        
	The aim of splitting the syllabus was to reduce exam-related stress on students.         
	The CPM-backed All Bengal Teachers Association, which had initially opposed the move, accepted the government order on Wednesday.

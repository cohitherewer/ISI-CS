The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Beware of green Subhas: Subhash
                                                                                                               Beware of green Subhas: Subhash
                            
	The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government is gunning for the Maidan but Subhas Chakraborty is behaving as if he already owns the greens.        
	The minister plans to hold a meeting on March 4 at Netaji Indoor Stadium to help decide what to do with the Maidan. He will call sports personalities and some other leading citizens, he says. He may even invite Subhash Dutta, he smirks.        
	The grand invitation to his namesakes durbar has made the greenman see red. The Good S vs Bad S war is on  and no prizes for guessing whose side we are on.        
	Subhash Dutta, whose court petitions have helped protect the Maidan from the government on more than one occasion, warns against the threat posed to the citys lungs and urges Subhas Chakraborty, through Metro, to lay off.        
	Beware, the man who always wears a hat is out to achieve a hat-trick  a hat-trick of messing up things.        
	Subhas Chakraborty, who has been a failure in both the departments he controls (transport and sports) is now aiming to destroy the Maidan.        
	The state government was first snubbed when Calcutta High Court ordered the Book Fair out of the Maidan for creating environmental pollution on the precious patch of green.        
	Subsequently the ruling party was also censured by the high court for violating the courts directives regarding holding of rallies and meetings on the Maidan.        
	So now the state government wants to wrest absolute control of the Maidan and carry out such environment-threatening activities through the backdoor.        
	And who better than Subhas Chakraborty to lead such an anti-environment campaign?        
	After all he has the unique distinction of championing automobile pollution as his department has all along been a silent observer-cum-collaborator to polluting autorickshaws and other commercial vehicles despite several court directives.        
	How can he talk about building a sports complex in place of the race course? Look what he has done to Salt Lake stadium and Howrah maidan.        
	As a well-wisher I request Subhas Chakraborty to do his job as transport and sports minister and not aspire to be the Maidans manager.

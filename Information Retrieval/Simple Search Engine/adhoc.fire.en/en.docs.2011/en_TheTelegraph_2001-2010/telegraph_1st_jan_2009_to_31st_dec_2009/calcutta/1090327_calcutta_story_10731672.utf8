The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Friend held for Mukesh murder 
                                                                                                               Friend held for Mukesh murder 
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Mukesh Jaiswal                                   
	A businessman friend who had borrowed Rs 70 lakh from restaurateur Mukesh Jaiswal and allegedly refused to return the money was arrested on Thursday for masterminding his murder.        
	Police said Sarod Gandhi, 30, hired three goons and a Tata Sumo last week to execute his plan. He allegedly called the co-owner of the popular City Centre restaurant Kaafila for a business meeting on Sunday evening and ordered his men to strangle Mukesh to death with a clutch wire in the moving car.         
	The body was dumped in a sewer near BT College in New Barrackpore and found the next morning.         
	 It was cold-blooded murder. The prime accused was a hard nut to crack but has confessed to the crime, said Supratim Sarkar, the superintendent of police of North 24-Parganas.        
	The police zeroed in on Sarod, one of those who had gone to a police station on Sunday night to report that Mukesh was missing, after an unidentified witness said he had seen him getting into a car with the 30-year-old victim.        
	While interrogating Sarod, who deals in machinery and industrial tools, investigators noticed a scar on his face and asked him how he had got it. He accused his wife of attacking him with her nails while quarrelling over something at home. We immediately called his wife and she told us that there was no such fight. The scar was actually inflicted by Mukesh, an officer said.        
	Based on his confession, the police arrested Monnu, the driver of the Tata Sumo in which the murder was committed.        
	The three hired goons, who were apparently rewarded with Mukeshs gold chains and diamond-studded bracelet after the crime, are absconding.        
	Mukesh, described by family members as a large-hearted man, had known Sarod for only five years but trusted him enough to lend Rs 70 lakh without any collateral. His only condition was a stake in the new business Sarod was planning to start with that money.        
	Months passed but Sarod showed no sign of starting the business he was supposed to. Mukesh, who had recently lost a huge amount of money in the stock market and was forced to borrow from various sources, asked Sarod to repay the loan. Thus a murder plot was born, an investigator said.        
	Sarod allegedly called Mukesh around 7.30pm on Sunday, saying he wanted to discuss something. He was waiting in the Sumo at a place near Salt Lake with the three hired goons in the back.        
	They spent a few minutes in a restaurant. From there, Sarod asked Mukesh to accompany him to Jorabagan to meet a client. Soon after the Sumo sped towards Rajarhat, the hired men strangled Mukesh to death with the clutch wire, the officer said.        
	Sarod is a resident of Pathuriaghata, under Jorabagan police station in north Calcutta. He owns a shop on NS Road in BBD Bag.         
	Sarod and Monnu have been remanded in police custody for eight days.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Guwahati flights cancelled 
                                                                                                               Guwahati flights cancelled 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	All eight flights to Guwahati from Calcutta were grounded on Monday because of a sandstorm in the Assam capital. No flights took off from Guwahati either.        
	A similar situation prevailed in Imphal, too, and three flights to the Manipur capital from Calcutta were cancelled during the day.        
	On Sunday, too, a sandstorm had stalled flights for nearly eight hours, with visibility varying between 1,000 and 800 metres from 6.30am to 2pm.        
	Mondays sandstorm was less severe but caused more disruption as it lasted longer. Visibility dropped to 1,500 metres in the morning and was around 1,700 metres towards the afternoon.        
	The Instrumental Landing System (ILS) could have helped operate the flights but the equipment was removed from Guwahatis Lokapriya Gopinath Bordoloi Airport on March 5 for a construction work. The system was to be reinstalled by March 25 but sources said the storm over the past two days had prompted the authorities to consider bringing it back in the next 48 hours.        
	The minimum visibility required for manual landing is 2,800 metres, much more than what the storm allowed.         
	Low visibility prevailed throughout the day at the Guwahati airport and all eight flights from Calcutta were cancelled, an official at Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport said.         
	Around 600 passengers en route to Guwahati from Calcutta waited in the domestic terminal lounge for a few hours before the authorities announced the cancellation of the flights. Most opted for the airlines offer to accommodate them on Tuesdays flights if the weather improved.

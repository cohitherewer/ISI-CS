                      Beyond figurative expression                    A restless pursuit to seek and understand the unknown marks the works of Manoj Roy. His experiments with colours and strokes are part of his attempt to find meaning from the chaos and confusion in the world around him. The artist often portrays forms that are ugly and violent, in bold colours and strokes, picturising a world under a threat that is physical, painful and very palpable. Touch and Go, the ongoing exhibition of his recent works, showcases the power of his painstakingly-crafted visuals. Guns, turbans, anonymous faces and a vivid crimson recur through the series on show; animals are portrayed in a mysterious light, life-giving acts of a sower and a devotee share wall-space with images of 21st century terror. Yet, his paintings appear to be bathed in a surreal light that provides them an almost dreamlike quality, elevating them to a level more sublime than could be attributed to the mere forms that occupy his canvases. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of his works lies in the way they light up the artists search for expression. While some of them are figure-studies in the broadest sense of the term, there are definite attempts to rise above the figurative element and assimilate into the works a complete and comprehensive world view.

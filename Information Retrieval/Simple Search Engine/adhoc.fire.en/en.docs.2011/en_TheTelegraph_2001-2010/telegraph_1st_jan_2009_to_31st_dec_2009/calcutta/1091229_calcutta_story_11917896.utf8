	The government is planning to use commercially a portion of the parking lot under construction opposite Writers Buildings.         
	Industries minister Nirupam Sen, also in charge of the development and planning department, visited the site on Monday with the secretary and senior engineers of the public works department (PWD).        
	The facility is expected to be ready in January.         
	Fee parking will help generate funds for the parking lots maintenance, said A.R. Bardhan, the PWD secretary.         
	The two-tier parking lot will have a capacity for 700 cars. The first floor will be reserved for 400 government and VVIP vehicles and the rest can be used for fee parking, explained a senior PWD official.

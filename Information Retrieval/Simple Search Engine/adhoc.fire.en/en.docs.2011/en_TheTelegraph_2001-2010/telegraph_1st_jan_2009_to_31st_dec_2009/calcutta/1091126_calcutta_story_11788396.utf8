                      Dedicated to world peace                    Violence, it seems, is deep-rooted in the human instinct and has surfaced repeatedly through the ages, always with disastrous consequences. Last year, all of us were stunned, shocked and outraged by the enormity of the atrocities inflicted on innocent Indian and foreign civilians in Mumbai, on this very day. Presented by Alsoc (the alumni association of St Xaviers Collegiate School), A-Shanti, this evenings concert on world peace, is being held to mark the first anniversary of the Mumbai terror attacks. It includes readings from the works of Tagore, Martin Luther King, Mahatma Gandhi and songs of Bob Dylan and Tagore amongst other contemporary presentations. Rabindrasangeet will be presented in an innovative way along with its Hindi and English translations. Participants: Dhritiman Chaterji and Raima Sen (narration), Pramita Mallick (Tagore songs), Sounak Chattopadhyay (Hindi versions of Tagore songs along with the original), Neel Adhikari and his team (popular English numbers on peace and brotherhood), and Alokananda Roy (choreography). Concept, script and direction: Sounak Chattopadhyay.                  Event: A programme on world peace presented by Alsoc When: Today at 6 pm Where: St Xaviers School grounds

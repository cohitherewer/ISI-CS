The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | In the name of the father
                                                                                                               In the name of the father
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Martin Luther King III at Mother House (Amit Datta)                                   
	Martin Luther King III, the son of legendary civil rights leader Martin Luther King Junior, took a trip around Calcutta on Thursday as part of his visit to India to commemorate the 50th anniversary of his fathers pilgrimage to the country.        
	King III, a civil rights activist himself, and his colleague Johnny Mack first visited Mother House to pay tribute to Mother Teresa, who, according to King III, personified the spirit of love.        
	King III next met governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi, whose grandfather Mahatma Gandhi was a huge inspiration for King Junior during the American civil rights movement.        
	It was to learn more about the Mahatma that King Junior had travelled to India in 1959 with wife Coretta Scott King. King III also visited Gandhi Bhavan in Beleghata.        
	I am visiting India to pay tribute to Mahatma Gandhi and retrace the footsteps of my parents pilgrimage to the country, said King at a ceremony on Martin Luther King Sarani, which was attended by mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya and US consul-general Beth A. Payne.        
	King III expressed his gratitude to Calcutta for naming a road after his father and said he hoped the work his father had started would be fulfilled some day. The city and this country have inspired me to work more diligently and fulfill my fathers dream. I want to come back again and again, he said.        
	King III said he had expected a spectacular experience in India but did not realise it would be a life-changing one. I leave with a renewed commitment to the philosophy of non-violence. It is relevant today as much as it was in 1959, he said.        
	His last stop before he took the flight to Atlanta at the end of his 13-day visit to India was at the ICCR on Ho Chi Minh Sarani to accept Rotary District 3291s peace award.        
	His last word on a city stage? Namaskar.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cop and CMC flop show
                                                                                                               Cop and CMC flop show
          OUR BUREAU                           Power cables snapped by an uprooted tree at the MG Road-Surya Sen Street crossing. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha                                   
	Calcuttas vulnerability to a natural calamity was exposed once again on Monday despite Cyclone Aila sparing the city its full fury.        
	Uprooted trees blocked vehicular movement on roads while frequent power cuts threw railway schedules haywire, causing problems for thousands of people who had no choice but to venture out on Monday.         
	There was a weather warning but the city was still not prepared for a calamity. Everyone suffered because the agencies concerned were not ready. One cannot prevent a natural calamity but peoples pain could have been minimised had the agencies done their homework, said Nirmalya Mukherjee, an IT employee looking for transport to return home.         
	But police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti said he was satisfied with the way government agencies handled the most potent storm to hit the city in recent memory. Our disaster management team is working towards speeding up rescue and relief work in the city. I dont think there is any lack of co-ordination.         
	But going by the way various departments functioned since Sunday evening, it was clear that they did not have a plan to tackle the impending crisis.         
	The Met offices warning about Aila approaching the city reached the state government at 8pm on Sunday night but the first meeting between the civic officials and the police top brass did not start until 12.10pm on Monday. The city police chief returned to Lalbazar after attending a meeting with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Writers Buildings around 11.15am and set the ball rolling.        
	Only then did one see a sense of urgency at the police headquarters, a source said.        
	Lalbazar conveyed the weather warning to the officers-in-charge of all 48 police stations in the city on Sunday night itself but no requisition slips were issued to keep a fleet of vehicles on stand-by to remove uprooted trees and ferry people involved in rescue and relief operations.         
	As reports of trees being uprooted by the roaring wind started reaching the traffic control room at Lalbazar, the officers of various police stations were asked to rush to the spot and co-ordinate. Most of these officers had no idea whom to co-ordinate with, the source said.         
	Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya blamed the lack of preparedness on the unprecedented situation rather than inefficiency. Over 1,800 trees were uprooted within three hours. Nobody could have predicted a cyclone disaster of this dimension, he said. He couldnt explain why the civic body was missing in action when the city needed it the most.        
	We called up the CMC control room around 2.30pm to ask for workers to remove uprooted trees. We were told that 70 teams had fanned out. But when we asked the official to name one person with whom we could co-ordinate, he fumbled, said a senior officer of Burtolla police station.

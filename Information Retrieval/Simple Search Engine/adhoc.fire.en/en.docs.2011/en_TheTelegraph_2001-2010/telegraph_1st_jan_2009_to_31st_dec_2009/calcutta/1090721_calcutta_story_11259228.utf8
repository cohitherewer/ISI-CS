                      Spanish film fest                    Showcasing a classic mix of contemporary, glamourous, award-winning and entertaining box-office hits, UTV World Movies presents a four-day festival of Spanish films that promises to provide city movie buffs something to cheer about. Featuring inimitable productions from a wide variety of genres, ranging from romances, musicals and comedies to murder mysteries, gangster flicks and psychological studies, it will entertain as well as provide food for thought to the discerning movie-going audience. With two screenings scheduled per day, today, the inaugural day of the festival, features Incautos (at 4 pm) and The Art of Losing (a still from the film appears here; at 6.30 pm). In Incautos, the protagonist Ernesto, in a flashback, remembers his childhood in an orphanage, youth in a smash-and-grab burglary till his partner is caught, then his tutelage from Lefty, an aging swindler. Now he has an offer, a swindle that will put him on easy street. But, he has fears of being double-crossed. Sergio Cabreras adaptation of Perder Es Cuestion De Metodo, The Art of Losing stars Daniel Gimenez Cacho as a reporter who comes across a corpse that has been dispatched in a gruesome manner. He and an office clerk end up discovering some of the worst aspects of Bogata while investigating the death. Leading them through the underground is a prostitute. They soon discover that the murder may have been politically motivated.                  Event: Spanish film festival

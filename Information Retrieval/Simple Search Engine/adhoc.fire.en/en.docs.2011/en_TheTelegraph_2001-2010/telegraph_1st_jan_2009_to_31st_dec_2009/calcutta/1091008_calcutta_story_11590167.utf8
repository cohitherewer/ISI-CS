The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | City blacked out by rain
                                                                                                               City blacked out by rain
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Blame the weather for the powerlessness in the city and its neighbourhood, yet again.        
	Like in mid-September, persistent showers in south Bengal over the past few days have flooded mines, dampened coal and disrupted generation, triggering a shortfall in the city on Wednesday.        
	At 7pm, the shortfall was 90MW in the CESC-served areas and around 450MW in the areas supplied by the state power utility.        
	There were rotational power cuts of 60 to 120 minutes in many areas.        
	Restricted import from West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (WBSEDCL) resulted in the power cuts in our area. The state agencies were hit by dwindling supply of coal, for which generation and supply took a hit, said a CESC official.        
	Among the worst-hit areas were College Street, Bowbazar, Salt Lake, Maniktala, Kankurgachhi, Phoolbagan, Sovabazar, Girish Park, Bhowanipore, Ballygunge, Hazra and Tollygunge.        
	Suhasini Roy, 76, had a hard time climbing the stairs in the dark to her sons sixth-floor flat in Kankurgachhi on Wednesday evening.        
	Helped by my grandson, it took me nearly 20 minutes to get up to the sixth floor. I was scared of crashing into someone or tripping, Roy told Metro.        
	There was a get-together at home this evening when the power was out for nearly two hours. Most of the guests left after sweating it out in candlelight. It was really embarrassing, said Kalyan Basu, 26, a Salt Lake resident.        
	At 7pm, CESC sent out 1,421MW, with the Budge Budge, Titagarh, New Cossipore and Southern generating stations contributing 928MW. The utility imported 471MW from the state distribution company and 22MW from other agencies.        
	Because of low supply of coal, a 210MW unit at Bakreshwar and two 210MW units at Kolaghat are lying almost idle, said an official of the West Bengal Power Development Corporation Limited.        
	Officials of the power agencies expect the situation to improve in a day or two. Things should get better from Thursday, said a WBSEDCL official.

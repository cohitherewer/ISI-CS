The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Speed gun nails 22 on road
                                                                                                               Speed gun nails 22 on road
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	More than 20 speeding vehicles were booked on VIP Road on Monday afternoon after police ran a scan with a speed gun.        
	We tested the operation of the speed gun for a month at several points in the city, including Baguiati and Lake Town. On Monday, we launched our drive and booked 22 vehicles, said an officer of the Lake Town traffic guard.        
	Of the 22 vehicles, 14 were private buses and six were taxis and cars. Only two motorcycles were found violating speed rules. Over Rs 20,000 was collected as fine.        
	According to traffic cops, the drive was carried out for nearly one-and-a-half hours on Monday afternoon. Since the camera needs good light to capture images of vehicles, we carried out the drive in the afternoon. Moreover, many drivers tend to speed during the afternoon as there is less traffic, explained a traffic sergeant.        
	Once a speeding vehicle is spotted by the camera, it has to be intercepted within a few minutes. Two officers were positioned with the speed gun near Dum Dum Park on the flank of VIP Road leading to Ultadanga and six stood about one-and-a-half km away to stop the errant vehicles.        
	When the speed gun found a vehicle crossing the 65 km/hour limit, the camera clicked its image along with its registration number. The number was then passed on to the other team, which intercepted the vehicle and slapped a case under the Motor Vehicles Act.        
	We learnt about the registration numbers of the errant vehicles over the phone and intercepted it within minutes, said Subrata Sen, the officer-in-charge of the Lake Town traffic guard. The images of the vehicles and their respective speed would be printed as evidence and produced in court, cops said.

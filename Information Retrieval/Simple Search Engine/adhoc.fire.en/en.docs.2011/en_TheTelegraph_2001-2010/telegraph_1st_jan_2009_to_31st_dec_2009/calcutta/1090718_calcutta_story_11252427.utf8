The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Attendance dips across offices 
                                                                                                               Attendance dips across offices 
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Attendance in government and private sector offices dipped to its lowest point in the past few years because of the lack of transport options and the fear factor on Friday.        
	Only 12 per cent of the employees turned up at the civic body headquarters on SN Banerjee Road.         
	The state secretariat fared worse with attendance below five per cent.        
	The tech hub at Sector V in Salt Lake recorded attendance between 60 and 70 per cent, which is much lower than the turnout during other bandhs.        
	Several companies, including IBM, Wipro, TCS, BNKe Solutions and HCL Technologies, had made arrangements for employees to stay back in office on Thursday night and vehicles to pick up employees before the bandh started.        
	Chief secretary Ashok Mohan Chakrabarti admitted that attendance at Writers Buildings was negligible.        
	Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said unavailability of transport kept employees away from work.        
	Most of those who stayed home said they were afraid to venture out.        
	I drive to my office in Salt Lake early on other bandh days. But I didnt take that risk today as images of buses burning on Thursday were too scary, said a senior official at a leading IT firm.         
	Many doubted the official attendance figure at the IT hub.        
	I had to stay back in office on Thursday night as I had to work on a project. I stepped out of the office in the afternoon to see the impact of the bandh on Sector V and found the streets deserted. I dont think more than 60 per cent employees turned up for work today, said a young techie.         
	Though there were no roadblocks in the IT hub on Friday, buses were absent on the road and autorickshaws were a rare sight.

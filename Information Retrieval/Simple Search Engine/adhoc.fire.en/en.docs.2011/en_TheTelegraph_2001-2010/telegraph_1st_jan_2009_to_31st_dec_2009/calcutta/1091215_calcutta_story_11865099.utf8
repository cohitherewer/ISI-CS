          ONTHESPOT - KUMARTULI REHABILITATION                          Construction is underway at 541B Rabindra Sarani, where the artisans will be shifted. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                                  
	The ball has finally been set rolling for the long-awaited renovation of Kumartuli. Though construction is not likely to start before February 2010, the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), the projects executing body, has started work on relocating the artisans. Metro takes stock of the project and its peeves.               
	The project:         
	An area spread over 3.87 acre has been demarcated in Kumartuli for building four blocks in G+3 and G+4 formats. The ground floors will house the artisans workshops, while the upper floors will comprise of residential quarters. The dwelling units, each covering 27sq m, will have a multi-purpose room, a bedroom, a kitchen, a bathroom and a balcony.         
	An exhibition-cum-sale hall spread over 325sq m, a dormitory for workers, a training and health centre, two parks, a stage and a community hall have also been planned under the project. The artisans studios will occupy almost the same floor space as their former workshops, said a CMDA official.         
	The Kumartuli project falls under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission. Around Rs 22 crore has been sanctioned for the project  to be borne by the central and state governments  but CMDA officials feel the project cost will rise.               
	The rehabilitation:             Kumartuli artisans worked mostly in makeshift sheds till now. A Telegraph picture      
	For the next couple of years, 541B Rabindra Sarani will be home to the Kumartuli artisans. Till a few weeks back, the Rabindra Sarani address housed godowns owned by the public health engineering department and the department of health and family welfare. The godowns are being razed to build temporary quarters for the artisans.         
	We got possession of one of the godowns in April and the rest about 10 days ago. The place was filled with mounds of cement and iron rods and was unfit for living, said a CMDA engineer. The rehabilitation cost is being borne by the state. Though estimated at Rs 1.61 crore, the expenses have already gone up to Rs 6 crore, say CMDA sources.         
	The rehabilitation will be carried out in two phases  blocks B (Ganga Prasad Lane) and C (part of Bonomali Sarkar Street) of Kumartuli will form the first phase while blocks A (Durga Charan Banerjee Street) and D (Rabindra Sarani and another part of Bonomali Sarkar Street) will comprise the second phase.               
	What caused the delay:        
	A revised blueprint of the Kumartuli facelift was drafted in September 2008, and chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee laid the foundation stone in January 2009. The CMDA started work nine months later. The delay has irked most Kumartuli artisans.         
	The CMDAs indifference is the reason behind the delay. The entire process, from survey to plan submission and deed processing, is taking longer than necessary, said Mintu Pal, the joint secretary of Kumartuli Mritshilpi Sanskritik Samity.         
	The other reason for the delay was choosing the rehabilitation site. Three sites  Strand Bank Road, Pran Krishna Mukherjee Street and Nivedita Park in Bagbazar  were considered by the CMDA and the artisans before deciding on the Rabindra Sarani site.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | US fast food chains eye Calcutta pie
                                                                                                               US fast food chains eye Calcutta pie
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          A Papa Johns leaflet                                  
	After McDonalds, KFC and Pizza Hut, Calcutta will soon welcome Papa Johns, the third largest pizza company in the world, which wants to set up 10 to 15 outlets in the state.        
	Papa Johns International Inc. is among the six popular US-based food majors seeking partnership opportunities in eastern India, according to a release by the US Commercial Service, an agency of the US department of commerce.        
	Papa Johns, which owns or franchises over 3,000 restaurants worldwide, has spelt out a concrete roadmap for Calcutta and the East. They want to open around 15 outlets in the next four to seven years, Arup Mitra of the US Commercial Service told Metro on Thursday.        
	The other big US food brands looking at Calcutta are Churchs Chicken, one of the largest quick-service chicken chains in the world, CKE Restaurants, Tropical Sno, a leader in the shaved ice industry, The Melting Pot, one of Americas premier fondue restaurant franchises and Round Table Pizza.        
	The food sextet is looking to come to town riding on the US Commercial Services Focus Franchising programme, designed to assist Indian franchisees to establish commercial relations with US companies. Tropical Sno and Churchs Chicken are also said to be very bullish on Calcutta.        
	The US Commercial Service is collecting expressions of interest from Indian companies. Our role is threefold  to provide market intelligence, find suitable local partners for the US brands and do the due diligence for them, added Mitra.        
	Papa Johns, which has 23 outlets across India, has stipulated a minimum required investment of $150,000 per location. Tropical Sno, which will bring in its entire line of 23 flavours, is scouting for partners offering mall locations.        
	The new entrants will add more spice to the fast-food cauldron. While Papa Johns will offer competition to Pizza Hut and Dominos, Churchs Chicken  founded in Texas in 1952  will be pitted against KFC, specialising in southern American-style fried chicken.

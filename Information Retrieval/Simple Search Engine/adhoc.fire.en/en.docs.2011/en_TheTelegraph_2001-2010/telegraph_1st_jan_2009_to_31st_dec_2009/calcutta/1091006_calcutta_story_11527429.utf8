The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Breast cancer breakthrough
                                                                                                               Breast cancer breakthrough
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Gene signature study of a tumour can lead to early detection and cure of breast cancer, said an oncology expert from Mumbai while visiting the city recently.        
	The study of gene signature of a tumour (genetic abnormalities in a tumour) helps a doctor plan the treatment according to an individuals requirement, said Arun Kurkure, a consultant oncologist at Mumbais Breach Candy Hospital and Research Centre.         
	Kurkure was in the city to attend a workshop organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) and the Ficci Ladies Organisation.         
	He said the chance of a cure is greatest when the tumour is smaller than 14mm in diameter.         
	If the tumour is very small in size and not detectable clinically, then the chance of it spreading to other parts of the body is remote and surgery itself can be curative, explained a doctor.         
	City-based surgical oncologist Gautam Mukhopadhyay said the study of gene signature of a tumour was a breakthrough in the management of breast cancer.        
	If the behavioural pattern of a gene can be changed, the patient may be cured or the cancer may not manifest. The treatment includes targeted therapies and specially designed medicines, said Subir Ganguly, the head of the oncology department at NRS hospital.        
	Doctors say a high-fat diet and other lifestyle-related factors have led to a 5 per cent increase in breast cancer cases in Calcutta in the past five years.

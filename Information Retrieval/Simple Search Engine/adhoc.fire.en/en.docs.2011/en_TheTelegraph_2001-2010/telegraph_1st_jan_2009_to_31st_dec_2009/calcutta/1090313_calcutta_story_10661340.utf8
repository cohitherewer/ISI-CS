The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CU nod to law review
                                                                                                               CU nod to law review
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Law students at Calcutta University will be able to get their answer scripts re-examined from this year.         
	The law faculty council of the university recently accepted the students demands for review.        
	The proposal will be placed before the university syndicate for approval, said Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee, the pro vice-chancellor (academic).        
	According to sources, the matter is on the agenda of Fridays syndicate meeting. Examinees have been allowed to only apply for post-publication scrutiny (PPS) since the university introduced law courses over a century ago. Whether all answers have been marked and whether the marks have been added right are checked in PPS. BA, BSc and BCom students of the university can request re-examination of their answer scripts.        
	There has been a persistent demand from law examinees for reviewing answer scripts. Bowing to the pressure, the university authorities allowed ad hoc re-examination of scripts at least thrice in the past two decades.        
	After the publication of 2008 LLB results on February 5, a large number of examinees had lodged complaints with the university stating that their papers hadnt been marked properly and should be reviewed.        
	We had been noticing that the demand for review is increasing by the year. Instead of allowing review on an ad hoc basis, it is better to amend the rules, said Manik Bhattacharya, the principal of Jogesh Choudhury Law College and a member of the universitys law faculty council.

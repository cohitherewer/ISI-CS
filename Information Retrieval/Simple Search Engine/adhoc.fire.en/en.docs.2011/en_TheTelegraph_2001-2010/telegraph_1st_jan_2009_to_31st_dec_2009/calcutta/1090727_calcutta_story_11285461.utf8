The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Youth held for trader murder
                                                                                                               Youth held for trader murder
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 26-year-old man was arrested on Sunday in connection with the murder of Dipak Mittal in his Bantra office on Saturday evening.         
	The incident prompted the district police brass to showcause the inspectors-in-charge of Jagachha and Bantra police stations for deterioration of the law and order situation in their areas.         
	Mittal, a resident of Bhairab Dutta Lane in Howrah, used to look after the pipe fittings business of his maternal uncle Purushottam Agarwal. A gang led by Dipak Singh had demanded money from Mittal before hacking him to death, said the police.         
	Singh, who runs a grocery shop on Netaji Subhash Road in south Howrah, was charged under section 302 (murder) and 394 (voluntarily causing hurt while committing robbery) of the IPC.        
	He was produced before the chief judicial magistrate (CJM)s court, Howrah, on Sunday and sent to five days police custody.        
	The district police superintendent refused to comment on the showcause notices served to the two inspectors-in-charge.

                                                                                                               Panel for varsity head
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The West Bengal University of Health Sciences, to which medical colleges in the state are affiliated, is set to get a new vice-chancellor.        
	The universitys executive council recently approved a shortlist of three candidates for the post. The three-year term of current vice-chancellor Sidhartha Majumdar ends on January 31. The new vice-chancellor is likely to take charge on February 1.        
	The process of selecting the new vice-chancellor is underway, said Shantanu Banerjee, the registrar of the six-year-old university.        
	A committee constituted by the state government chose the three candidates last month. The shortlist is likely to be referred to the chancellor soon for his consent, said an official.        
	A source in the state health department said two professors of the radiology department of Medical College and Hospital and a senior Pune-based gynaecologist have made it to the shortlist.        
	The executive council arranged the panel in a descending order of preference. According to the university rule, the chancellor will examine the educational background and experience of the three candidates all over again. The council will take a decision after the chancellor gives his opinion, said a source in the health department.        
	One of the radiology professors was at the top of the panel, he added.        
	Medical College principal Indrajit Ray represented the Medical Council of India, gynaecologist Baidyanath Chakraborty represented the university executive council and city-based cardiologist and former member of the Calcutta University syndicate K.K. Hyder Siddique was the chancellors nominee on the panel constituted by the state government. Siddique headed the committee.

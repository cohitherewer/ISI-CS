          A STAFF REPORTER                          Raj K. Modi                                  
	The high court granted Vedic Village promoter Raj K. Modi bail on Tuesday morning, 80 days after he was arrested.        
	The division bench of justices Devi Prasad Gupta and Shyamal Kumar Chakrabarty gave bail to Modi in two cases  murder and forcible land grab at Rajarhat.         
	The realtor was earlier granted bail in 10 cases by the Barasat court and two cases by the high court. The police had slapped 14 charges on Modi, three of them non-bailable.        
	Nineteen-year-old Amirul Sardar was shot during a football match next to Vedic Village on August 23. A mob later burnt down the luxury resort. The incident brought forcible land purchase in the area under the scanner.        
	Public prosecutor Asimesh Goswami opposed Modis bail plea. The cops are filing more cases against him. Moreover, he is an influential person. If he is granted bail, he can influence the witnesses, said Goswami.        
	The judges asked Modi to not enter the Rajarhat area without informing the court.        
	Alleged land shark Gaffar Mollah, also held in connection with the Vedic Village incident, was granted bail on Tuesday in one of the 13 cases lodged against him. But he is still in custody for other charges.

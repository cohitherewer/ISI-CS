The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Europe calling for small enterprises
                                                                                                               Europe calling for small enterprises
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	A European window of opportunity has opened for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the state.        
	The Euro India Transportation Systems (EITS), a bridge-building platform reaching out to Indian businesses, has come calling to Calcutta, wooing SMEs in and around the city and promising to play matchmaker for fruitful partnerships to follow.        
	A predominantly Franco-German initiative, the November 17-19 conclave will be held in Metz, located in the north-east of France, capital of the Lorraine region and prefecture of the Moselle region.        
	The organisers expect over 40 SMEs from the state to participate in the event, to feature six complementary fairs  automotive, aerospace, shipbuilding, railway, logistics, truck amp; bus  and business conventions and 40 associated conferences.        
	The industrial profile of Metz matches that of West Bengal, with focus on areas like iron and steel, foundries and mine quarries. We are expecting around 300 Indian enterprises to engage in dialogue with 1,200-odd European companies, and Bengal will have a strong representation, Philippe Leclerc, the chairman of Proximum Business Events Engineering, a key organiser, told Metro.        
	The EITS platform aims at meeting the technical partnerships and R amp;D requirements and finding new markets for European and Indian companies working in the transportation systems branches.        
	The Moselle region benefits from an exceptional geographical situation. Its at the centre of a vast market of 200 million consumers, including the most concentrated industrial activities in Europe, which generates 50 per cent of the European Union GDP, said Thierry Petry, the director for India of Moselle Development.        
	The organisers of EITS have worked out a subsidised all-inclusive package of Rs 1 lakh for Indian companies.        
	The logistics and shipbuilding fairs would be of particular significance to Calcutta participants, felt B.G. Roy, the regional director of the Indo-German Chamber of Commerce. Roy hopes to lead a sizeable delegation of his chamber members to the meet.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Missing link of realty
                                                                                                               Missing link of realty
          SUBHRO SAHA                                            
	The scrapping of the 1,200-acre IT township next to Vedic Village has sent city developers scurrying to draw up demands for some fundamental chop and change to allow them safety nets in salvaging the brick-and-mortar industry, the second-largest job creator in the state and anchor to 300 downstream industries.        
	Credai Bengal is chalking out a three-pronged proposal document, based on success stories in other states, that will first be taken to the chambers of commerce and then to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Mamata Banerjee.        
	We are preparing a structured proposal for the governments perusal, Pradeep Sureka, the president of Credais state chapter told Metro.        
	The aim is to simplify things and give the realtor the option of not getting his hands dirty with land acquisition or burning his hands over failed government promises.        
	In states like Gujarat and Rajasthan, there is a buffer between developers and farmers in land aggregators or collectors, who buy land parcels from farmers to create large land banks. Realtors can then buy land from them at market rates, pointed out Pradip Chopra, a former secretary of Credais state chapter.        
	The land aggregator is a vital missing link in Bengals real estate ecosystem, since it minimises friction between farmers and realtors. But he can only come into the picture once the urban land ceiling Act is repealed or modified.        
	So, the Credai document will demand: simplification of laws (urban land ceiling Act scrapped by most states to be relaxed/repealed) so that like in other states, land aggregators come into play; the government fix land price for all projects approved by it and administrative support to deal with local elements.        
	The Urban Land (ceiling and regulation) Act of 1976), which has been repealed in states like Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Punjab and Maharashtra, still stands in its original avatar in Bengal (see box). This is the biggest stumbling block for large-format real estate and infrastructure developments in the state, pointed out Sushil Mohta, another past secretary of Credai Bengal.        
	The realty lobby blames the maximum ceiling limit of 500sq m for Bengal losing the Nano plant, the integrated Dankuni township, the IT Township for Infosys and Wipro, and the proposed Raichak-Kukrahati expressway.        
	It is learnt that Amar Nath Shroff and Raj Modi had directed their land-procurement team (headed by Gaffar Mollah) to finish purchase of the 1,200 acres required for the now-scrapped IT township directly from the farmers within 18 months.        
	Such haste could be suicidal and is bound to bring into play elements like Gaffar, warned Chopra. The land aggregators in states like Gujarat and Rajasthan would often purchase 1,000 acres over a 10-year period, and that prevents trouble, he pointed out.        
	Credai will also seek administrative support to prevent law and order situations and to screen the profiles of local elements who must be involved in the process.        
	Also, we often suffer because of gang wars between suppliers cartels and development is held up for months, complained a Credai member with a large project in Rajarhat.        
	Given the sensitivity of the land issue in the run-up to the 2011 Assembly polls, there is little chance of either Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee or Mamata Banerjee lifting a finger to change things on the ground, but the realty lobby has decided to chime for change.

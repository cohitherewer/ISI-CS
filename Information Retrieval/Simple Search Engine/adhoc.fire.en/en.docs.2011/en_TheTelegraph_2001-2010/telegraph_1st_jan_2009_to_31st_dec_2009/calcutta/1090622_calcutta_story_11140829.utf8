The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Why Kats is keen to hit Calcutta   Audience, God amp; she
                                                                                                               Why Kats is keen to hit Calcutta     - City turns out to be box-office charm for Bollywood beauty queen          PRATIM D. GUPTA                          EYEING CALCUTTA: Katrina Kaif on her last visit for Singh is Kinng                                        
	Namastey London. She comes to Calcutta to promote the film. Its a super hit.        
	Singh is Kinng. She comes to Calcutta to promote the film. Its a super hit.        
	Yuvvraaj. She does not come to Calcutta to promote the film. Its a super flop.        
	No wonder Katrina Kaif badly wants to come to Calcutta before Friday.        
	Calcutta  and not Salman Khan, who was her man in Yuvvraaj  could well be the good luck charm of Bollywoods reigning box-office queen.        
	I really want to come to Calcutta the city has been very lucky for me, Katrina told Metro with five days to go for the release of her New York, co-starring John Abraham and Neil Nitin Mukesh.        
	Honestly, I am pushing the producers Yash Raj Films to try and come to Calcutta. Its also an important sector and I want to be there. I hope the producers tie up with some multiplex and things work out, added the pretty woman who last came to town in August 2008 for Singh is Kinng.        
	But after nine no-show Fridays, thanks to the producer-plex war, and two non-starters (Kal Kissne Dekha and Paying Guests) in the two Fridays that followed the peace treaty, the multiplexes are desperately seeking the Katrina effect at the box office.        
	Audiences have been starved of entertainment and we have had a lot of enquiries about New York. People want to see John and Katrina together, said Captain Virendra Marya, the regional director (east) of INOX.                                
	We all have our hopes pinned on New York because if it does well, it will set the trend for the rest of the season with a long line of big releases (Kambakkht Ishq, Love Aaj Kal...), he added.        
	Katrina, of course, is well aware of the return-of-Bollywood scenario. Movies are a big part of our culture. People have missed going to the cinemas. I believe there is a hunger for films. I am really hoping that everyone gets back into the habit of watching movies... New York is a good film, a strong film.        
	A strong box-office show is what she needs after the debacle called Yuvvraaj. One must understand that I am just an actress, she argues. My job is to perform on the sets.... The rest is in the hands of God and the audience. Theres really nothing I can do about it.        
	Except maybe come down to Calcutta.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Dinos come to Digha 
                                                                                                               Dinos come to Digha 
                                            
	Visitors to Digha now have an added attraction  dinosaurs. The Digha Science Centre and National Science Camp, a satellite unit of the Birla Industrial amp; Technological Museum (BITM), has set up a dinosaur-themed park in New Digha to transport visitors millions of years back in time, when these pre-historic beasts ruled the earth.         
	Now they almost rule the waves. Along the road parallel to the seashore, a giant T-Rex with huge pointed claws and teeth marks the entrance to the sprawling Science Centre spread over four acres. The 1620sq m Jurassic Park offers a light and sound show on dinosaurs from Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.         
	There are 10 animated dinosaurs to wow visitors at the park, from the bird-like Archaeopteryx, the armoured Stegosaurus and egg-stealing Oviraptors to T-Rex, the strongest, fiercest and most well-known. He appears in the Phantom series as well as in the film Jurassic Park. The park was built in 10 months and cost Rs 25 lakh.         
	The animals have been moulded out of fibreglass and latex and mounted on a metallic structure with gears and links controlled by motorised and pneumatic circuits. Real and artificial trees, ponds, cacti and palm groves form the backdrop, against which the dinosaurs move their tails, get into fierce fights and lunge in sync with strobe lights, snowflakes and smoke.         
	The idea of a dinosaur park was initiated six years ago with a few manually operated models placed in one corner of the Science Centre.         
	It came up in 2003 but there were no sound or light effects. The models were not well mechanised either. Since tourist movement in Digha is quite high, an audio-visual show would be well received by the nearly 2 lakh visitors who come to the Science Centre every year. Its meant to be a fun and informative show that people of all ages can enjoy, said Abdullah Mondal, the curator of BITM, Calcutta, who conceptualised the show.        
	The narration is in Bengali, based on the trend of visiting tourists. We have plans to create such prehistoric parks in Purulia and Siliguri too, said E. Islam, the director of BITM.The show was inaugurated on October 6 by Swapan Kumar Pramanick, vice-chancellor, Vidyasagar University.        
	One only hopes that visitors from Calcutta will not end up throwing stones at the extinct animals, as they do at the zoo.

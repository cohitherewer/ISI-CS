The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Smart card turns stupid
                                                                                                               Smart card turns stupid

	Shreeya Mukherjee, a student of Calcutta University, was turned away twice last week when she tried to recharge her Metro smart card at the MG Road station. The recharge machines were out of order and she had to stand in long queues to buy tickets on both days.         
	I went to Chandni Chowk station on Saturday to recharge the card but it was the same story there too, said Shreeya.        
	Shreeyas ordeal is being shared by numerous Metro regulars in the last few weeks. The extended route from Netaji station (Kudghat) to Kavi Nazrul (New Garia) does not even have a counter for issuing smart cards.         
	According to Metro officials, the machines are very old and require frequent repairs.We have requisitioned new cards and turnstiles but the Centre for Railway Information Systems is yet to deliver them, said an official.        
	The magnetic paper-ticket system will be replaced with Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID)-enabled smart tokens for quicker dispersal of passengers, he said.        
	Commuters also complained that smart card gates and magnetic ticket turnstiles often remained out of order. According to the authorities, the Metro rail route has 208 turnstiles, of which 80 are for smart cards. After the upgrade, there would be 392 smart token gates.        
	During rush hours the authorities have started issuing non-magnetic paper tickets on the extended route. Though the route was extended last month, the Metro authorities did not install new machines at the four stations. They are using old machines at the new stations, said Dilip Mukherjee, the general secretary of the Metro Railway Mens Union.        
	Mukherjee pointed out that taking advantage of the faulty gates, many passengers were travelling without tickets or making short journeys.         
	Metro Railway is losing out on revenue. Passenger count has gone up to 5 lakh daily from 3.5 lakh-4 lakh earlier but the authorities have not arranged for additional rakes, smart cards and gates, said Mukherjee.        
	The authorities, however, hope to solve the problems before Puja. Our team is working at different stations for repairs, said J.K. Mitra, the chief operations manager of Metro Railways in Calcutta.

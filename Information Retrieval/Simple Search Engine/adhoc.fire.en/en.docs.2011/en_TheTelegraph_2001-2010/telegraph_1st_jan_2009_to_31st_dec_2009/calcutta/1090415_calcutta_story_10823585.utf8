The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sweet dreams for sniffer squad
                                                                                                               Sweet dreams for sniffer squad
  - Canines to get special cot and rosogolla with breakfast on Poila Baisakh           KINSUK BASU                          WOOF amp; WAG: A member of the dog squad gets a feel of the bed on Tuesday. (Bishwarup Dutta)				                                       
	Calcutta polices hardworking sniffer squad can now come back home dog-tired to a bed of dreams.        
	Each member of the 26-strong team will be gifted a dog cot on Poila Baisakh as an incentive to work (and play) harder in the Bengali New Year, beginning Wednesday.        
	For star performers Seema, Rini, Nitu and Ruby, it means bye-bye hard floor and hello lap of luxury  a 4x3 feet cot with padding and a wooden railing, just in case they tumble over.        
	This is the first time we will be setting up cots for the dogs in their cubicles (at the Police Training School in Alipore). A good nights sleep apart, a dog needs a nice resting place when down with an ailment like rheumatism, said Pradeep Pandey, the officer-in-charge of the dog squad.         
	The New Year gift will be officially unveiled at the end of a prayer session in the morning.        
	We will do a Ganesh puja, which the entire squad will attend after a bath. The dogs are usually bathed in the pond late in the afternoon after they return from work and play a while, a handler said.        
	Prayers over, the dogs will be off for breakfast with a sweet touch. It will be a slight change from the food they normally have in the morning. We will serve them two rosogollas each along with their usual quota of chapatti, eggs and milk, Pandey said.         
	What if the canines develop a sweet tooth and demand dessert every morning?        
	That wont be encouraged. In any case, we never give them something made in ghee; so most sweets are out. Two rosogollas each on Poila Baisakh are meant to symbolise a new start for them, just as it is for us.        
	Seema, Rini, Nitu and Ruby would surely say woof!woof! to that.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Deer thief caught in the act
                                                                                                               Deer thief caught in the act
          A STAFF REPORTER                                                    The deer that Sanjay Sarkar (above) tried to steal from the Salt Lake rescue centre. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)      
	The poacher who killed the doe that went missing from the Salt Lake animal rescue centre in June was caught on Tuesday attempting to steal the lone remaining deer in the enclosure.         
	Sanjay Sarkar, 24, was found crouching near the deer enclosure around 4.10am and caught while trying to jump over the fence. Guards at the animal rescue centre, a two-hectare campus located near a Calcutta Armed Police camp, saw four others standing outside the fence but could not catch them.         
	Sanjay was carrying a chopper and a wire-cutter.         
	The guards had at first mistaken the intruder for a monkey. One of our colleagues felt something move in the darkness and alerted us. A closer inspection revealed that it was a man. He was wearing only a pair of shorts and had camouflaged himself by smearing his body with mud, a guard said.         
	On realising that he had been spotted, Sanjay grabbed the branch of a tree and tried to jump across the fence. He also whistled to alert his accomplices, who immediately ran, the guard said.         
	The four men waiting on the other side of the fence crossed the Kestopur canal and fled before the guards, all former army personnel, could catch up with them.         
	The forest department produced Sanjay in the court of the additional chief judicial magistrate in Salt Lake, which remanded him in judicial custody till September 2. He has been sent to Dum Dum jail.         
	Soumitra Dasgupta, the conservator of forests, said Sanjay had not only confessed to killing the seven-year-old doe that went missing in June but also playing a role in the theft of eight rare monkeys from Alipore zoo earlier this month. But the police said there was no evidence yet of the youth, who is from Shantipur in Nadia but lives near Kestopur, having anything to do with the zoo episode.         
	We have interrogated him and our preliminary investigation suggests no link with the theft of eight Common Marmosets, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of the detective department.         
	Sanjay has been booked under the Wildlife Protection Act. If convicted, his punishment will be a maximum of seven years in jail along with a fine of Rs 20,000, or both.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Poll panel inches towards invasion
                                                                                                               Poll panel inches towards invasion
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	The Election Commission took another step towards invading National Library on Friday but gave officials of the Alipore address the impression that it had not yet decided whether to barge in or back off.        
	Principal librarian R. Ramachandran, who was part of the talks with the commission, said in the afternoon that the library could yet escape a 20-day poll assault as the final decision would only be taken on Monday. But chief electoral officer Debashis Sen left no doubt about the commissions intentions later in the evening.        
	The obstacles are almost certainly out of the way, Sen told Metro. Readers and staff members will be given special passes for access to the library on all days.        
	Ramachandran had said after the meeting that officials of the Election Commission told him and others that the decision to move in or not would be taken by the chief electoral officer on Monday.         
	We are keeping our fingers crossed, he added.        
	The Election Commission team had taken with them a map and a copy of their proposed takeover plan, about which the library officials raised several objections.         
	We told them about the inconvenience readers would face if the campus was taken over by EVM distribution centres, Ramachandran said.        
	Additional returning officer A.K. Singh and his colleagues inspected the old reading room after the meeting. The commission intends setting up distribution centres and a strongroom there.        
	An official of the commission claimed that the plan was discussed but no decision was taken. Nothing is final yet. We discussed every aspect, including security and the problems readers might face. A report will be submitted to the chief electoral officer and he will take the final call.         
	He may have already done that. Readers and staff will face no problem in terms of entry or exit from the library even during counting, when the complex will be barricaded. We are doing everything within our means to avoid inconveniencing those involved with the library, Sen said.        
	Didnt the library officials oppose the takeover at Fridays meeting? The (final) meeting was quite successful and held in a very cordial atmosphere, he claimed.        
	Opposition from the staff and readers had brought the chief electoral officer to the library door on Thursday. Sen had assured director K.K Banerjee of a rethink on setting up polling booths and counting centres in return for his support.         
	We are hoping for the best but also prepared for the worst, said Banerjee.        
	The commission has requisitioned the library from April 28 till May 17. Poll personnel had last moved in during the Assembly elections in 2006 and left the 30-acre campus in a shambles.

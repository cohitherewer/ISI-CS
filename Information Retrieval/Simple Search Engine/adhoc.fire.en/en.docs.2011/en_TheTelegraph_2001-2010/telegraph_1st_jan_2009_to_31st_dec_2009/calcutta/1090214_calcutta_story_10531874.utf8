The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Office tiffs of Manna
                                                                                                               Office tiffs of Manna
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Arindam Manna was often in conflict with his colleagues at the 30-member GRP unit at Dum Dum station, according to the CID.        
	Based on the familys complaint, we are looking into Mannas relationship with his colleagues, said a CID officer.        
	Political interference, lure of bribes and threats from criminals are a part of our lives. Manna was soft-spoken and reserved, and clearly uncomfortable in this environment, said a GRP officer, who had worked with the sub-inspector for a year.        
	Manna was transferred to Dum Dum in April 2005 after serving the force in Diamond Harbour and Baruipur. His primary responsibility was to head a four-member plainclothes team.        
	Some plainclothesmen take bribes for allowing illegal activities. Division of the booty is a source of constant conflict, said a rail official.        
	Dum Dum GRP sources said Manna was lately being given office work, which left him with little time to lead the team. His colleagues told Metro that he was upset with the change in work profile.        
	Dum Dum GRP officer-in-charge Manab Chakraborty, whom the family has named in the FIR, said on Friday that he had shared a cordial relationship with Manna.

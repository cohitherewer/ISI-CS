                      A peep into slices of life                     I regard the theatre as the greatest of all art forms, the most immediate way in which a human being can share with another the sense of what it is to be a human being  Oscar Wilde.        Theatre has existed since the dawn of man, as a result of human tendency for storytelling. Since its inception, theatre has come to take on many forms, utilising speech, gesture, music, dance and spectacle, combining the other performing arts, often as well as the visual arts, into a single artistic form. Despite the onslaught of multiple forms of entertainment, theatre still remains one of the the most popular forms, more so for its inherent power of adaptibility. It is, in fact, a window to the other world. Ever since its inception in 1953, Sangeet Natak Akademi has been instrumental in nurturing and preserving our traditions by offering them an institution form. Natyanjali, the five-day theatre festival beginning today, is being jointly hosted by Sangeet Natak Akademi and Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre (EZCC) and features plays from different regions of the country. The inaugural play in Bengali, 1857  A Journey to the Ignored Past (Alternative Living Theatre, Madhyamgram) is directed by Probir Guha. The line-up of the other plays are: June 10: Oriya play, Veer Surendra Sai (Shree Cultural Association, Sambalpur); June 11: Chhatisgarhi play, Pahatiya (Gudi Sanskritik Evam Samajik Sansthan, Raigarh); June 12: Bengali play, Aparahata (Sandarbha; picture along) and on June 13: Hindi play Tilka Majhi (Living Opera, New Delhi).

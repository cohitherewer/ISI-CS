The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Only connect
                                                                                                               Only connect
          The cousin from abroad is met every day. Senior citizens are turning into Netizens. The webcam is changing lives                           Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                      
	The cousin from abroad is met every day. Senior citizens are turning into Netizens. The webcam is changing lives               
	Its Friday evening and Anita Pyne is rushing through her chores. She has to meet her daughter at 8pm. She finishes her cooking, cleans up the kitchen. A fresh sari and bindi later, shes ready. Her daughter Priyanka breezes in 10 minutes later and the two chat about their day, the Metro rail mess and Diwali plans. Only Anita is at her SP Mukherjee Road home and Priyanka in Mauritius.         
	Skype, a technology that enables transmission of voice over the Internet, is changing lives. Add a webcam and the computer is your window to the world, to your daughter in Mauritius, to your son in Seattle. You can see them, talk to them directly, free, and ask them to wait as the doorbell rings. It makes virtual communication almost real.         
	No wonder people are hooked.         
	Skype has made our stay in Mauritius bearable. We know its not the real thing, but its the next best thing to meeting our family, says Priyanka, who moved to the island country in 2003.         
	Old habits die fast        
	The young were always technology-friendly. Where a service such as Skype scores most is with a section of the demographics not traditionally known to be tech-savvy. Senior citizens are using it with flair. It is particularly useful in Calcutta, sometimes called an extended old-age home in an obvious reference to the steady flight of its youth to greener pastures.         
	A web-based application is becoming a way to stay in touch with the citys young.         
	Indrani Banerjee, 25, who catches up with her cousin based in Latvia in eastern Europe over Skype every Sunday, says her mother was so overwhelmed to see her niece move around her apartment that she started crying. The best part about Skype is the visual bonding it allows, says Indrani.         
	Senior citizens are turning into Netizens. Skype is so much better than a phone call  we can see them moving around the house, eating, playing, cooking, says Balen Nandi, a retired teacher, whose son lives in the UK with his wife and two daughters. Sunday 7.30pm is Skype time at the Nandi household in Salt Lake. Come hail or high water, or guests, the elderly couple are loath to give up their precious time with their children.         
	Email, chat, voice chat have for long slain the distance devil, making communication easy and affordable. But it is movement that has made Skype a craze.         
	Though Skype is not the only option for using the webcam, Netizens swear by its service. Its picture and voice quality are deemed better than other web applications that allow video chat such as GMail, Rediff and Yahoo Messenger. Defined as a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) engine, it can be installed on almost all computers, whether they run on Windows, Mac OS or Linux.         
	Country cousins        
	The web has created its own web of family ties. Priyankas six-year-old daughter Teesta, sitting in Mauritius, teaches dance steps to her four-year-old cousin Piu in Boston and Nandis little granddaughter Annita in London shows off her ballet skills to her relatives in Calcutta.         
	The cousin from abroad has changed forever. Even 10 years back, a visit from her would be an event. She would be an exotic creature, from a superior culture that allowed her not to know Bengali, subdue others to her moods, a free way of behaving and clothes that needed to be tempered with a shawl. Much like Ila of Amitav Ghoshs The Shadow Lines, who wore clothes the like of which neither I nor anyone else I knew in Calcutta had ever seen and spoke of vagina-envy. She was distant and alluring  enough for the unnamed narrator to fall in love with her.         
	Much later, in Jhumpa Lahiris The Namesake , the idea of the foreign cousin persists. No such luck today, with Facebook, Orkut, Twitter, Google chat, Yahoo Messenger and, of course, Skype. Cousins in Kansas and Kasba connect every day.         
	I am getting married in a few months. Every time I come back from trousseau shopping, I hold up each purchase before the webcam for my cousins, says media professional Chandrani Chatterjee. A male cousin living in California didnt quite approve of the magenta panjabi for the groom, and it was changed the next day.         
	Thats how close you can be on Skype.Thats how the Kasba cousin doesnt nurse an inferiority complex any more. They have seen it all, through Karan Johar  and the webcam.        
	Real vs virtual        
	There are frustrations too. Golpark resident Aditi Banerjee, who reads out Hattima tim tim to her grandson in Adelaide on Skype, admits the so-near-yet-so-far feeling can be frustrating at times.         
	My grandson Sohom was sick last week and it broke my heart to see him suffer. But I can hardly fly off to my daughters home every time any of them falls ill, she says.         
	Others have grown so dependent on the Net that not being connected seems like a handicap. After the Aila cyclone, the Internet connection at my Kasba home was disrupted for a few days and it was unbearable, says research scholar Ipshita Dutta Majumdar. Her husband studies in Toronto.         
	So, how real is virtual?         
	Eta doodh-er shaad ghol diye metano, admits Balen Nandi, quoting a popular Bengali idiom about making do with the next-best-thing.         
	Psychologist Mohormala Chatterjee gives Skype a thumbs up, but with a word of caution. Building a relationship, through whatever medium, is always good. Those who moved abroad would earlier end up leading insular lives, cut off from their roots. A sense of alienation would creep in over time. If web-based applications help fill that void, its great, she says. But she adds that virtual relationships should not be at the cost of real friendships forged on the playground or the classroom. This is the time when children learn social skills.        
	But Skype, and other time zones, have become a way of life. Ipshita is up at 7.30 every morning to see husband Gautam, for whom its 10pm the previous night in Canada. Ami toh Internet-er madhyomei sansar korchhi (I live my family life through the Internet), she says. For others, going online is like catching up on their favourite daily soap.         
	Recently Indian security agencies called for a ban on Skype as its service providers refused to share the encryption code with Indian authorities, who feared terrorists might use this medium to secure communication. The news left many worried.         
	I heard about the proposed ban and was alarmed at the prospect of my lifeline with my daughter and grandson being snapped. I hope the dispute is resolved, says Aditi Banerjee.   
	SAMHITA CHAKRABORTY LAHIRI  
	And those who will not fall on line...  
	Social networking sites like Orkut and Facebook have created a counterculture, a group of ldquo;others rdquo; who will not network. Who don rsquo;t upload their pictures and if they blog, their blog probably has an invite-only readership. The idea, they say, is to stay ldquo;not connected rdquo;.           
	As research associate Sanchita Dutt (name changed), 25, puts it: ldquo;There is too much pressure to be cool. rdquo; What is cool? ldquo;You must upload pictures, change your status messages and think of interesting things to say. I just don rsquo;t have the energy, rdquo; says Sanchita, who has tried out Orkut.   
	Anwesha Mitra, 25, was on Orkut till she, too, lost patience. ldquo;When I created the account there were no privacy settings and I didn rsquo;t like the fact that anyone could come visit my profile and add me. So I deleted my account, rdquo; she says.   
	One doesn rsquo;t want the whole world, or even the entire circle of friends, to view pictures, relationship status updates, conversations with other people and other details. But changing settings and customising it, to keep exactly a few in the loop and the rest out, is a tightrope they prefer not to walk. On Facebook, you can leave your pictures open to everyone, or to just your friends, or to your friends rsquo; friends or to your friends and people from a certain network/location or community. But your friend-list includes your seventh grade physics teacher, a busybody aunt and your 10-year-old-cousin, none of whom should be privy to your pictures showing you downing tequila shots. You rsquo;d have to customise settings and make the album accessible to all friends except these three whose names you might have to type separately. As Anwesha puts it ldquo;Why bother! rdquo;   
	Some just wouldn rsquo;t want to be found by old friends or classmates. Sometimes someone would just want to cut off all ties. Aritro Ganguly, an executive in a sector V company, deleted his Facebook account after a bad break-up. ldquo;Even if she wasn rsquo;t on my friends list her friends would be and she would always be able to access my profile. Or I rsquo;d always get news of her. I deleted my account to snap all lines of communication, rdquo; he says.   
	Some don rsquo;t network because they have a longer attention span. Says a 29-year-old, self-confessed online recluse: ldquo;The Net affects your quality of life. Ten years ago I rsquo;d come back to Calcutta after months. There was no Net where I was and I would read for seven days at a stretch. Eight to nine-month-old newspapers, or old magazines. With the Internet here I don rsquo;t do that anymore. Nowadays I only see boyfriends enraged by ex-girlfriends who rsquo;ve updated their profile in a way that is designed to provoke them, rdquo; he says. How about some peace and quiet?

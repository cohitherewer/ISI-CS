                                                                                                               HC closes computer centres
  - Selection attributed to Subhas under court scanner          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          Subhas Chakraborty                                        
	A decision attributed by a state counsel to the youth welfare minister has come under the scanner of the high court three days after the death of Subhas Chakraborty.        
	The court on Thursday ordered a 15-day closure of 200 computer training centres suspected to have been selected without publishing advertisements. Chakraborty was the minister of the department, youth welfare, which facilitated the centres.        
	The centres selected without inviting applications by publishing advertisements will have to be closed down for 15 days, said Justice Sanjib Banerjee.         
	The order will affect over 30,000 candidates enrolled with the 200-odd training centres, said an official in the youth welfare department.         
	Justice Banerjee issued the order after state lawyer B. Patranabish submitted: We have learnt from the youth welfare department that it was the minister (Chakraborty) who would select the persons or organisations eligible to run the centres.        
	The youth welfare department has set up more than 300 such centres across the state in an attempt to bridge the digital divide. According to an arrangement, the rent of the centres and part of the electricity bill are borne by the government while infrastructure and other aspects are the partners responsibility         
	The court took up the matter following a petition by four persons who accused the government of cronyism and challenged the process of selecting private partners for running computer centres backed by the youth welfare department. In early 2004, the department had published newspaper advertisements inviting applications for running computer centres. Around 100 applicants were shortlisted. But a few months later, the department selected a batch of 200 partners without putting out any advertisement, the petitioners had alleged.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Song for a stranger
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Song for a stranger
                              Sufi singers from Egypt Naglaa and Mona Fathy perform at Tollygunge Club. (Bishwarup Dutta)                            
	What happens when two pretty young women from conservative upper Egypt take to music, put on indefinite hold all plans of marriage and set off for far-away lands accompanied by three men who are not their relatives? It is unthinkable back home, admits Mohamad Farghaly, the leader of Assiut Classical Arabic Band.         
	The impossible has happened. Naglaa and Mona Fathy, twin sisters from Assiut, have made their way to India and taken the stage in a series of concerts across the country. On December 6, they performed at Tollygunge Club for Ruhaniyat, an all-India sufi and mystic music festival organised by Banyan Tree.         
	On the eve of the show at a guest house in Salt Lake, the sisters sat clad in pastel-coloured hijabs. The voluble Farghaly spoke for the sisters who could not speak in English.         
	In our schools, we have Quran recitation contests, for which one needs a good voice. They used to get praised by classmates. Fifteen years ago, when they were 16, they asked around where they could learn music and came to me, he recalled.         
	Farghalys own musical journey had a more rocky start. I was a tourist guide, I spoke 12 languages. But one day, I heard someone strum a lute and realised to my dismay that this was what I wanted to do.         
	He was 24  too old for the university, the sole learning window for music at that time. But he managed by himself and went on to lead the band of the citys Palace of Culture, run by the ministry of culture.         
	What has worked in favour of Naglaa and Mona is their fathers support. He is a government official and used to act as a bodyguard for his daughters wherever they went. But actually he went to listen to the music, smiles Farghaly .         
	The family has come to trust the band leader so much that the daughters are now part of an itinerant band that includes Farghalys 27-year-old son Mohamad and 26-year-old brother Zaki. Normally to travel abroad, a girl should be accompanied by her husband. I may have 36 musicians with me, but these two are my star singers. The band is one of the five major acts in upper Egypt.        
	Naglaa and Mona are the eldest of five daughters and a son. Naglaa is older than Mona by 10 minutes.         
	What about the future? Mona says she can give up her music if her husband is a good man, Naglaa says that is not enough.         
	As one takes leave, Naglaa murmurs. She wants to sing for you, smiles Farghaly. Then the voice is heard  a passionate, hypnotic voice pulsating to the rhythm of the oud. It is an old song. It means, O stranger, take care of yourself, for you take my heart with you. Where words fail, music takes over.

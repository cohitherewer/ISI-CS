The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Old school bus wins court nod
                                                                                                               Old school bus wins court nod
  - Precedent fear in fume fight          OUR BUREAU                                                  
	Calcutta High Court on Friday gave Modern High School for Girls the green signal to run five buses more than 15 years old, provided they meet the emission standards, setting what the green lobby saw as a dangerous precedent in the fight against vehicular pollution.        
	The engines of the old buses  that have been slapped with a government notification to go off the road from July 31  will be converted to LPG mode by fitting a special kit, the school assured the court.        
	When the lawyers appearing for the school pleaded for time till August 1 to convert the old vehicles, the division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice B. Somadder granted the prayer and asked the government to allow the school time for conversion.        
	State advocate-general Balai Ray, who was present in court, said the government had no objection if the premier school was allowed to run the five older buses in its fleet of seven.        
	Environmentalists were quick to warn that this verdict would set a precedent and allow old and polluting vehicles to first duck the July 31 phase-out deadline and then remain on road by taking the conversion route, even though a solitary experiment on a government bus had flopped (see graphic).        
	This is just what the government was waiting for. Now, it gets another ploy to go slow on the phase-out of old vehicles and create more confusion in the run-up to the July 31 deadline, said transport expert S.M. Ghosh.        
	What has stumped Anumita Roy Chowdhury of the Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment is the fact that till now only three-wheelers and small vehicles have been converted to LPG in various parts of the country.        
	How can an old bus, that too a schoolbus, be converted to LPG without any proven safety and environment records? demanded the air pollution expert.        
	A spokesperson for Modern High denied that the school would be setting a dubious precedent by allowing old and polluting commercial vehicles to continue belching killer fumes affecting the citys children the most.        
	As our buses will not be categorised as commercial vehicles, other commercial vehicles cannot use our case as a precedent, stressed the spokesperson.        
	We are happy that we will not have to scrap the buses since they are in perfectly good condition. We will now have to officially change the category of our vehicles and convert them to LPG.        
	But the court made it clear on Friday that it was not deciding whether the schools buses came under the purview of commercial vehicles. Here, the school authority is seeking permission to convert their vehicles to LPG and we are allowing its prayer, said the division bench.        
	So, on paper, the school buses remain commercial vehicles and that is what leads Abasesh Daw, the general secretary of the Minibus Operators Coordination Committee, to declare: This sets a precedent and gives us the opportunity to mention this in court in our fight against the phase-out of old vehicles by July 31.        
	When Modern High School  which teaches environmental sciences as part of its curriculum and prides itself for having an active Nature Club  had filed the petition to save its old buses, the government had initially opposed it.        
	The bench too had rapped the school for pushing for its old buses when 43 per cent of the citys children were suffering from pollution-related respiratory diseases.        
	But on Friday, the LPG route won the courts approval, allowed the school to retain its old buses, armed the transport lobby with a weapon to fight the ban on old vehicles, and gave the government another ploy to duck a deadline.

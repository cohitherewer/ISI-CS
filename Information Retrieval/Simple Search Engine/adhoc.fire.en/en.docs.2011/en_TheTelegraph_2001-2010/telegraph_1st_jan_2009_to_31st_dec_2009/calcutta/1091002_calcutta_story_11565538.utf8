The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Writers still in holiday mood
                                                                                                               Writers still in holiday mood
  - Ministers lead missing-at-work team        KINSUK BASU                                                  
	Your Puja break may have started on Friday and ended on Monday but the babus at Writers Buildings are still enjoying an unofficial extended vacation that began a week before yours.        
	Bengals seat of power switched to festive mode on September 18  Mahalaya  and seems to be in no hurry to get back to work.        
	On Thursday, the first day of the month, several ministers and secretaries were missing from Writers.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who has just returned from a holiday in Maithan, was in office both on Wednesday and Thursday but left a little earlier than usual.         
	Probably because several of his ministry colleagues were absent.        
	Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya was away in Siliguri, ostensibly to monitor the political turmoil there. Fire and emergency services minister Pratim Chatterjee was busy elsewhere, according to an official of his department.        
	Nanda Gopal Bhattacharya, the minister for water resource development, Kanti Ganguly, the minister for Sunderbans affairs, irrigation minister Subhas Naskar and his jail department counterpart Biswanath Chowdhury were the other absentees.        
	With the ministers staying away, the babus were in no-work mode. The average attendance in various departments was around 60 per cent in the two days since the Puja holidays officially ended but the majority of those who turned up didnt hang around for more than a couple of hours.        
	In some of the more sparsely populated departments even the plastic covers of the computers werent removed. An officer of the central despatch office, one of the cogs in the administrative wheel, said the festive calendar was such that government employees could easily take leave for a few days and enjoy a 17-day holiday stretching till next Sunday.        
	After Mahalaya came Id, then the Puja holidays from September 25 to 29. Most of us took casual leave to fill the gaps in the holiday calendar. Friday is a holiday on account of Mahatma Gandhis birth anniversary and Saturday is Lakshmi puja, the officer explained.        
	He was among those who called it a day by 3.30pm. The few who stayed back were in no mood to work. Some of them exchanged notes on how they spent the Puja holidays. One group was seen having an animated discussion on the mayoral contest in Siliguri.        
	People will probably start reporting for work next week, though I suspect nobody wants Monday to arrive, was the parting shot from the central despatch officer.        
	His office recorded an attendance of close to 70 per cent but little work got done during the day. Seventy of the 92 employees of the social welfare department and 180 of the 300 in the PWD did turn up, but files barely moved.        
	An employee seated in health minister Surya Kanta Mishras antechamber mildly protested on being asked whether any work was done during the day. Mantri na thakley-o kaaj hoy (work gets done even if the minister is not around), he said, head reclining on folded hands atop the table.        
	Sanket Chakrabarty, the secretary of the Trinamul Congress-backed Federation of Secretariat Employees (Unified), confirmed that many employees had left within two hours of recording attendance.

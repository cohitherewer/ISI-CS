                      The practice of modern art                    A true work of art becomes complete only in the act of viewing, in the interactions that take place between it and viewer and in the stories that develop around this encounter. Indian Contemporary Art in Palais Benedictine, France is a curated show where each work is presented as a proposition that accommodates diverse readings, occupies a range of contexts and resists the conventional and exhausted binaries of East- West and global-local. It also aims to record a moment in contemporary Indian art that is defined by the interplay between speed and hesitation: two conditions of being that brace, define and animate one another. This articulates itself through works that are no longer artefacts confined to a frame or pedestal, or even to the gallery space; but which assume the form of arguments, conversations, stories. Ultimately, what comes through is the individual artists need to address the crucial question of how the self is shaped in relation to mythic and real structures, the resonances of the past and the templates of the future, aesthetic impulses from within art conventions and political stimuli emanating from the environment. What viewers get to see is an expanded conception of art-making, which attempts to cope both with the altered logic of art practice as well as the current pressures exerted by historical forces. Participants: Atul Dodiya (a painting by him appears here), Jayashree Chakravarty, Mithu Sen, Riyas Komu, Vivan Sundaram and others.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | For the city to breathe easy
                                                                                                               For the city to breathe easy     - Return of a streetcar named desire 
          TAMAGHNA BANERJEE AND ZEESHAN JAWED                          Commuters make a beeline for a crowded tram at Sealdah on Friday morning, with buses and taxis off the roads because of the one-day strike. Picture by Amit Datta                                         
	The tram was back to being a streetcar named desire as Calcutta got through Friday without its fleet of private buses and taxis.        
	It was nice to see people queuing up to board trams for a change. It reminded me of the 70s and the 80s, when the tram was a very popular mode of transport, 58-year-old Biswanath Ghosh, a tram conductor on the Belgachhia-BBD Bag route, told Metro.        
	The city may have had to make do with less than one-fourth the fleet of buses promised by minister Subhas Chakraborty but not many seemed to miss the fume-spewing monsters that monopolise the roads on a normal day.        
	The 147 trams that were pressed into service  42 more than on a normal day  ferried around 60 per cent more people than the daily average of 75,000. We had to cancel the weekly day off and sanctioned leave of some staff members. We are glad it paid off, said Pradip Chattopadhyay, the managing director of the Calcutta Tramways Company (CTC).        
	Fridays revenue was over Rs 5 lakh, against Rs 2.8 lakh on an average. The daily passenger count is around 75,000.        
	Bank executive Avantika Ghosh, waiting for a tram at the CR Avenue-BB Ganguly Road crossing in the afternoon, wondered why the government wasnt strengthening the citys tram network instead of trying to placate the bus and taxi lobby.         
	The roads would be so much safer and the air we breathe a lot cleaner if trams were to be the major mode of public transport along with the Metro, she said.        
	Bappaditya Majumdar, a 58-year-old RBI employee, said travelling by tram to office was a relaxing experience that he would like to repeat every day given the chance. On other days, commuting in the city is like a fume-filled battle for survival, he added.        
	Around 400 trams used to ply in the city till the 1980s, ferrying almost 40 per cent of the commuters on any given day.        
	But the tram, which came to the city before the bus, was sidelined by the diesel lobby, said Debasish Bhattacharya, who has been anchoring an international campaign to save the citys trams.        
	Trams have been running successfully in around 450 cities around the globe but the Bengal government has been doing everything possible to phase out this eco-friendly mode of transport, from dereserving tram tracks to winding up routes, he said.                  
	Friday forced many Calcuttans to take the tram and revive the romance of cleaner and greener times. Suvendu Chakraborty, who took a tram from Sealdah to Esplanade, said he would prefer travelling the same way every day if the authorities took steps to make tram services more efficient. A lot of us wouldnt board polluting taxis and buses if we had access to efficient tram and Metro services. In fact, unruly buses and taxis are the ones that trigger traffic jams and slow down the trams.        
	The Calcutta State Transport Corporation and the CTC together ran 842 buses, more than the number for a normal day, but far short of the total requirement.        
	Apart from trams, Metro Railway was the big draw on strike day and autorickshaws the most easily available and popular mode of transport to get to the nearest station.        
	Atanu Das, a resident of Bikramgarh in South 24-Parganas, was pleasantly surprised to reach his office in Bagbazar earlier than on other days after taking an auto and the Metro instead of spending an hour in a direct, but smoke-belching, bus. I must use this option more often, he grinned.

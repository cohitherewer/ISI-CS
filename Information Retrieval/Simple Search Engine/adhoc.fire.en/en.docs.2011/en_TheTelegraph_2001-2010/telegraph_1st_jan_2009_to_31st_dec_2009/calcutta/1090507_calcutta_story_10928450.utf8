                      Creations of a new order                    A creation  painting, drawing, sculpture or installation  is largely dependent upon the experience of the creator and his sensibilities in responding to his socio-cultural environment. In the process, a work of art helps to express an artists intensely felt experiences, using a language that reflects the emotional impulse of the creator. Forms of Narration brings together the paintings and drawings of artists of the present generation whose works strongly reveal their individual styles in expressing their narrative statements, all of them situated within the milieu of lived reality. The paintings of Arpita Pradhan emerge from the daily experiences of urban life where man is trapped within a closed environment. Sudipta Duttas works mirror the loneliness of man in modern society. Sushmita Rakshit (a painting by her appears here) portrays the hollowness of love and relationships in the world today. The canvases of Biswajit Mukherjee are coloured with the many aspects of nature. While Nandita Mukherjee deals with the relationship of man with nature, Sumana Ghosh depicts family relationships in her works. Also featuring paintings by Sumana Biswas, Utpal Dutta, Subha Basu and Arnab Mukherjee.                    lEvent: An exhibition of paintings by artists of the new generation lWhen: Till May 15 (except Sunday); 12 noon - 8 pm lWhere: Eye On Art Gallery, 3 Pretoria Street, 2nd floor

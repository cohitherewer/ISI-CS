The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Brace for roads minus transport
                                                                                                               Brace for roads minus transport
  - Factors many in stand-off behind strike                                              
	Almost the entire public transport system may disappear from Friday if the operators go ahead with the indefinite strike. Metro narrates the consequences and focuses on the issues at stake and the parties involved.              
	What could be off the street?        
	Around 12,000 buses; 3,500 minibuses; 2,000 contract carriages (including school buses); 42,000 taxis and 40,000 goods vehicles. Around 1.5 lakh goods carriers will be on the road. Leaders of the autorickshaw unions said they would not join the strike.               
	Why?         
	Transport unions claim they had called the strike to protest government atrocities  a reference to the transport departments attempt, long overdue, to enforce the high court ban on 15-year-old commercial vehicles which will come into effect on August 1.         
	We requested the government to move court and seek an extension of the deadline for the phase-out of old vehicles. We also tried to move court ourselves. But all our efforts proved futile. Now, strike is the only option left to resist government atrocities, said Swarnakamal Saha, the president of the Bengal Bus Syndicate.        
	Independent observers, however, sniff a strategy to paralyse public transport and compel the government to move court praying for an extension of the deadline.               
	 Who is to blame?         
	A) Government: The high court issued the phase-out order on July 18, 2008, but the government swung into action only a few weeks ago. A lack of initiative and planning mark what the government is touting as its attempt to enforce the ban.        
	The department has failed miserably, said a leader of the CPMs labour wing Citu. It should have prepared long ago acceptable packages for replacement of old vehicles with new ones.         
	The only successful package the government has come up with  for taxis  has been bogged down by procedural lapses.         
	We have accepted the package but the government has failed to release its promised subsidy and ensure speedy disbursement of bank loans, said Bimal Guha, of the Taxi Bachao Committee.        
	The package for bus owners has been rejected by the intended beneficiaries while officials are yet to meet representatives of truck owners associations.         
	B) Opposition: Vote-bank politics is prompting the Trinamul-led Opposition to back the transporters cause. This is a fight for our livelihood. Political differences have sunk and we have joined hands with Left-affiliated unions, said a senior Trinamul leader in charge of various operator unions under the Banijyik Paribahan Bachao Committee, the umbrella body of all transport unions.         
	C) Transport operators: Transporters have always opposed the ban and whatever effort the government has made to enforce it. The umbrella body has moved the high court challenging the phase-out order and is even considering appealing to the apex court.        
	The government must see to it that the deadline is extended, asserted Tarak Nath Bari, the secretary of the Calcutta Taxi Association.         
	D) Citizens: Unfortunately, a section of Calcuttans has never been concerned about the foul-fume fight, giving the other stakeholders a chance to get away with their lapses. There are so many larger, more crucial issues that should be at the top of their (the government and the high court) mind, said Manjir Roy, 36, a schoolteacher. Id prefer pollution to strikes, shrugged Samrat Dutta, 26, an executive of a private firm.               
	What happens next?         
	Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty vows to implement the court order. Transport unions are firm on their strike plan. Commuters are keeping fingers crossed, fearing the worst.         
	 Meghdeep Bhattacharyya, Jayanta Basu and Kinsuk Basu

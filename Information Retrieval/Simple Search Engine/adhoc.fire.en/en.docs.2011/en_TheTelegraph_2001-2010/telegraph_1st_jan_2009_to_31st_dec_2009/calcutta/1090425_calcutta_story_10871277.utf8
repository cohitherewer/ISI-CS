The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Film school meeting 
                                                                                                               Film school meeting

	Five students of the Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute were given 20 minutes to present their case at the governing council meeting of the film school in Mumbai on Friday. They were representing the agitating students of the institute, shut since April 2.        
	The outcome of the two-hour meeting will be known on Monday, said the students. The film school authorities were not available for comment.        
	The meeting in an NFDC conference room at Worli was an attempt to resolve the deadlock at the film school, which was shut after students staged a 24-hour gherao, demanding resignation of four senior officials over lack of proper academic schedule, inadequate infrastructure and lack of proper faculty.

                                                                                                               Gun loss triggers sleuth   suicide
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A 50-year-old police officer committed suicide, apparently triggered by the loss of his service revolver, by throwing himself in front of a moving train.        
	The body of Tarun Dutta, an assistant sub-inspector of the district intelligence bureau, was found beside the tracks at the end of platform 8 of Howrah station around 7.30am on Friday.        
	An office identity card and a cellphone were found on him. There was no suicide note, said Tapas Kumar Das, the superintendent of railway police.        
	Officers claimed on the basis of statements of an ex-colleague of Dutta that he had mistakenly left behind his service revolver in a taxi and then panicked.        
	But no cabbie till late on Friday had submitted the gun to the police.        
	The cops said Dutta had sent a text message to wife Malati in the morning saying he would not return and that he had no desire to live. Within 15 minutes, she got a call from the Howrah GRP, informing her that her husband had met with an accident.        
	The resident of Shibpur Road, whose only daughter studies in Class XI, was posted at a night-long cultural programme in Barasat on Thursday. After his duty ended early on Friday, he came to Sealdah by train and took a taxi.        
	The police have learnt that Dutta got off the taxi at the Shibpur market. Soon after the taxi sped off, Dutta realised that his bag containing his service revolver was in the vehicle.        
	The sleuth rushed to Shibpur police station, where he met a constable who had once been his colleague. I advised him to lodge a diary but he suddenly became agitated saying it was all over for him. I tried to pacify him but he ran away, the constable said.        
	A probe revealed that Dutta took a taxi to Howrah station and walked to the far end of platform 8, where he kept waiting for a train to enter or leave the station. He jumped on the tracks around 7.30am when the Down Kamrup Express was pulling in.        
	Munna Khansama, who collects used mineral water bottles from trains, saw the sleuth jump in front of the train.        
	The man was standing beside the tracks while I was preparing to board the moving train. Then he suddenly threw himself on the tracks. I immediately jumped off the train and alerted the police, Munna recalled        
	Duttas brother Dilip, who identified the body, said: I just cant understand what drove him to commit suicide.... He must have panicked.

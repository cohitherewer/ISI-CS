The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pass tag for failed duo
                                                                                                               Pass tag for failed duo
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta University (CU) has cancelled the results of two unsuccessful BSc Part-II examinees and declared them successful after finding anomalies in the evaluation process.         
	The two students, who had appeared in the BSc Part-II exams from Netajinagar College for Women in 2008, had failed in the botany practical test.        
	After the publication of the results, the duo had lodged a complaint with the university against two teachers of their college who they alleged had given them less time to complete the practical test.        
	Instead of the stipulated three hours, the teachers had given them just one hour to complete the test, the students had complained.        
	The CU authorities set up an inquiry committee in January to probe the allegation. The panel, which submitted its report to the CU undergraduate council last week, found the two teachers guilty.        
	Most of the allegations of the two examinees have been found to be true, said Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee, the CU pro vice-chancellor (academic).        
	Accepting the report, the council recommended that the two examinees be not treated as unsuccessful in the botany practical exam. The CU authorities also removed the two teachers from all exam-related activities.        
	The two students will be asked whether they would like to be awarded average marks on the basis of their performances throughout the year or take a fresh test, said a CU official.        
	The official said the students had alleged that the teachers victimised them because they had refused to take private tuition from them.        
	The fact that the two students had failed because they were given less time has been established. But a detailed inquiry is required to probe the allegation that the two teachers had victimised them for refusing to take tuition. Stern action will be taken against the teachers if the allegation is found to be true, the official added.

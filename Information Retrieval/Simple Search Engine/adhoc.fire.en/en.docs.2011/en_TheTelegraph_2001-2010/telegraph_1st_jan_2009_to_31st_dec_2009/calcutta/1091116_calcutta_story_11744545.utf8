The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Suicide spurt stumps Metro
                                                                            Monday , November 16 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Suicide spurt stumps Metro
          A STAFF REPORTER                                        
	Three suicides in three days  a 30-year-old man took his life at the Sovabazar-Sutanuti station on Sunday afternoon  have stumped Metro Railway officials and left them groping for solutions.        
	Till late on Sunday, the man who had jumped in front of a Dum Dum-bound train at 4.04pm could not be identified. He was wearing black trousers and a short-sleeved shirt, police said.         
	The man jumped in front of the train and he was flung onto the third rail. He seems to have died of electrocution, said an official, adding that services were affected for over 40 minutes.        
	This was the fourth suicide on Metro tracks within two weeks. We have to somehow deal with the problem but we dont know how, said a senior Metro Railway official.        
	A possible solution could lie in the Singapore model, with a fibre-glass curtain along the platforms making it suicide-proof. The curtain-doors are aligned to the train doors and open only when a train comes to a halt.        
	The ministry has advised us to explore the possibility of putting fibre-glass curtains along the platform. We will have to ascertain the technical feasibility of this solution, said the official, who did not wish to be named.        
	The Metro authorities have tried to curb the suicide count by making announcements at stations dissuading people from ending their lives and displaying helpline numbers to encourage the depressed to opt for counselling. But to no avail (see box).        
	A senior official of the Delhi Metro Railway Corporation, which has a network of 78 stations spanning over 90km, said suicide attempts had been kept in check with extra vigilance.        
	At each Metro station in Delhi, around 20 commuter facilitating agents keep a close eye on passengers crossing the yellow line along the platform until the train arrives, said the official.        
	The Calcutta Metro has the white line, meant to stop passengers from getting too close to an approaching train. People here ignore the line and we dont have commuter facilitating agents, said an official.

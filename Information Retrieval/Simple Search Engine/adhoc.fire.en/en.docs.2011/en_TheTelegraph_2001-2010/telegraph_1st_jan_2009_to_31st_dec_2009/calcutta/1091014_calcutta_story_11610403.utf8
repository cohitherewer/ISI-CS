The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Reprieve for flout pandal
                                                                                                               Reprieve for flout pandal
  - Court cites public sentiment          OUR BUREAU                                    
	A road-hog Kali puja pandal has won a judicial reprieve with a high court judge choosing public sentiment over road rules, weeks after another judge of the court had done just the opposite for Durga puja.        
	Justice B. Somadder on Tuesday urged the administration to be more pragmatic and practical while dealing with the Naba Yubak Sangha puja (popularly known as Fatakeshtos puja), which has failed to keep the mandated 4ft free on all four sides of the pandal.        
	The administration should consider the sentiment of the common people while taking a decision and see to it that the puja is held like in previous years, the judge observed following an appeal by the north Calcutta club against a police order to trim the pandal and leave adequate space all around.        
	According to the state governments affidavit, the organisers have slightly deviated from space norms. All other rules set by the fire services and other departments have been adhered to. Local residents, too, have not raised any objection against the pandal, Justice Somadder said, while pointing out that the order could not be used as a precedent.        
	Justice Sanjib Banerjee, who had endorsed the government rules on pandals, had however observed in the run-up to Durga puja: Permission should be granted only after ensuring that the organisers are abiding by all norms... If any committee is found guilty of violating the norms, the police will have to demolish the entire pandal.        
	The police had then drawn up a list of over 740 rule-violating pandals but not acted against them, citing lack of time between the court order and Durga puja. But the scan on Kali puja pandals began with enough time to spare and Naba Yubak Sangha was among the first to be hauled up.        
	Will Justice Somadders order ensure a free run for road-hog pandals? We are yet to get a copy of the order but we will carry on with our inspection. Around 15 pandals were issued a notice on Tuesday for violating rules, said a senior officer at Lalbazar, while admitting that Tuesdays development has rendered the drive toothless.        
	Justice Somadder, meanwhile, asked the deputy commissioner of police (north), Biswarup Ghosh, to visit the Naba Yubak Sangha pandal along with club representatives by Wednesday morning and submit a report to the director-general (DG) of fire service. The DG, after studying the report, will pass necessary orders by Friday, the bench ruled. Kali puja is on Saturday.        
	We are confident of holding the puja. We did not make any change to the pandal after the police inspection on October 4, announced a member of Naba Yubak Sangha.

      Marmot dance                     
	Two photographic exhibitions with one theme, nature, were held in the city last week.     
	Nature Environment amp; Wildlife Society (NEWS), an NGO, held a show on wildlife in India at the Academy of Fine Arts.     
	The second exhibition by Debanjan Dasgupta, a Bangalore-based software engineer, which was held at a gallery near Gol Park, was more about cityscapes.    
	More than 60 photographs were on display at the NEWS exhibition. A pair of marmots in Ladakh seemed to be moving in a synchronised dance.     
	A running tiger in Ranthambore was caught on camera by Biswajit Roy Chowdhury. There was a shot of the rare Indian roller in Panna by Partha Dey. Twisha Lahiry had made figures of owls out of discarded stuff.    
	Debanjan has a story to tell with each of his frames. It is the tale of the man-nature bond.     
	A monstrous boulder threatens to drop off any moment in Uttarakhand; leaves float on a serene pond off Bangalore; a small wooden house stands atop a hill in Japan, embracing nature.

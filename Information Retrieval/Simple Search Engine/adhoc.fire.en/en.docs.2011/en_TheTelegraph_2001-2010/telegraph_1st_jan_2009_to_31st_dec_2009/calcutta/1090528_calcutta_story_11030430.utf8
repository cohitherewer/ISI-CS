The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Weekend target for tree-free roads
                                                                                                               Weekend target for tree-free roads
                                          
	The city remained Tarzan territory two days after the Aila brushed past, with trees still blocking lanes or leaning precariously on buildings, shops and even lamp posts.        
	After two days of setting foolhardy deadlines (first they said by Tuesday morning and then by Wednesday evening), the CMC said the roads would not be free of fallen trees till the weekend.        
	Several thoroughfares were cleared of the massive trunks that had blocked traffic till Tuesday, but in most cases the civic workers barely managed to shift the logs to the side of the road or prune some branches for a passageway.        
	Eighty per cent of the trees blocking the main roads have been cleared, claimed mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya on Wednesday evening.        
	Work remained to be done on stretches of Jadavpur, Kasba and some other pockets, he admitted, adding that the trees on smaller roads and lanes had not been removed.        
	Bhattacharyya claimed that the task had been made difficult by fallen trees getting entangled in overhead electricity cables. The civic workers cannot start cutting trees unless CESC officials come and defuse the wires. But they are too busy restoring power to households. This is delaying the clean-up process.        
	Debasis Chakraborty, the deputy chief engineer (civil), said even with 1,500 civic workers out on the roads the clean-up process would stretch at least till Sunday.        
	Sources in the civic body said lorries carrying tree debris had already made 400 trips to the Dhapa dumping ground. But logs, broken branches and leaves were seen heaped on the roadside across the city.        
	Metro went around the city on Wednesday afternoon to monitor operation tree clean-up and found that, for once, north had done better than the south.

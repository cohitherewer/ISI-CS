	A homoeopath who tried to commit suicide by jumping into the Hooghly on Monday afternoon was rescued by three policemen. Sudipto Kumar Biswas, 35, tried to kill himself because he was unable to repay his bank loans.        
	Sudipto, a resident of Saheb Bagan in Hooghly, jumped off a concrete platform at the CPT Quarters ghat on the Howrah side of the river.        
	Two residents who were bathing nearby saw the man jump and raised an alarm. Three men of the Plainclothes Police Party, which has an office nearby, rushed to the riverfront.         
	One of the cops, Srikanta Sen, 35, jumped into the water and dragged Sudipto out. The other two  Abdul Mustakin, 38, and police driver Babloo Halder, 33, helped him.        
	When the man jumped, the tide was ebbing. Though there was a strong current, the water level was low and I could spot his head, said Sen.        
	Sudipto told his rescuers that he had run up loans of Rs 2 lakh and was unable to pay the monthly instalments from his earnings of around Rs 8,000 a month.         
	He also told the cops that he rode his motorcycle to Bandel station and took a local train to Howrah.        
	Sudipto, who has a five-year-old daughter, said he arrived at Howrah station at 3pm and walked to the ghat.        
	Discarding his shoes, socks and jacket at the ghat, Sudipto jumped into the water.         
	Hearing about the incident, Sudiptos father Sunil Kumar Biswas, a retired deputy chief engineer of Eastern Railway, rushed to the hospital.        
	Sudipto had taken loans from three private banks to buy supplies for his dispensary at Lichubagan near his home. The total monthly payment came to Rs 7,000, which I was paying from my monthly pension of Rs 14,000, said Sunil.        
	Sunil said that it was not poverty but the anguish of putting so much burden on him that drove his son to try and take his life.        
	Asked about the incident, Srikanta Sen expressed his happiness at being able to save a mans life. I am glad we could save his life. I hope he recovers and returns home soon, said the cop.

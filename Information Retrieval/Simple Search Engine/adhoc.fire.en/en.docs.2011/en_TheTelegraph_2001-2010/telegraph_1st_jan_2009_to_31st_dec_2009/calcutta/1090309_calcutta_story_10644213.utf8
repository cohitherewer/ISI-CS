The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | If its the dance floor, it better be Jai Ho
                                                                                                               If its the dance floor, it better be Jai Ho
  - Citys party crowd hooked to Slumdog anthem after string of awards abroad          POULOMI BANERJEE                           A still from the Jai Ho number in Slumdog Millionaire                                        
	Slumdog anthem Jai Ho may be the Congress prized poll property  and CPM candidate Md Salims chosen words for wall graffiti  but its rightful owner is the dance floor, according to Calcuttas hottest DJs.         
	The party crowd hasnt stopped jiving to Jai Ho ever since the A.R. Rahman tune scored a hat-trick of victories at the Golden Globes, Bafta and the Oscars. I was playing Jai Ho at a party on the night of the Oscars and the crowd was so much into it that you could have thought it was the national anthem, recalls DJ Ravi.        
	Hardcore Rahman fans might argue that the soft-spoken composer has created far better tracks, but Jai Ho is hard to beat on current form. You cant argue with its success. Jai Ho first became popular abroad but it is now the hottest dance floor track everywhere. We play it a couple of times every night on request, says DJ Vishal of the Park Street nightspot Tantra.         
	So, does Jai Ho owe its popularity on the dance floor to the accolades it has earned abroad rather than musical merit?        
	 There is no doubt that the Oscar victory has fuelled the demand for Jai Ho but Rahman has always been hugely popular and anything he creates is a potential winner, says DJ Girish of Shisha, the lounge bar on Camac Street.        
	The disc spinner thinks Jai Ho will remain the tune of the season, including the Holi week.         
	I usually play Bollywood tracks with a folksy feel during Holi. Rang Barse (from Silsila) is the all-time favourite. Party people prefer tracks with energy and Jai Ho fits the bill both in terms of vibrancy and mood, explains DJ Girish. DJ Vicky, who will be playing at a private party on Holi, agrees. Jai Ho is one of the most-requested songs and I am sure people would want to hear it on Holi, too, he says.        
	Some DJs have come up with remixed versions of the song. The original song does not quite suit the dance floor. So I have done a remixed version, says Ravi.         
	But Vishal will blare it out just the way it is. I agree it is not the perfect tune for the dance floor but I am against remixing this track, he says.         
	Apart from Oscar mania, what has worked for Jai Ho is its theme. The song is all about the victory of right over wrong, of overcoming the odds. The youth can identify with this, though I must say that the songs popularity cuts across all age groups, says Ravi.        
	If Jai Ho has any competition, it is from other Rahman favourites like Masakalli from the Delhi-6 soundtrack. Genda phool is also popular and will be good for Holi, says Girish.

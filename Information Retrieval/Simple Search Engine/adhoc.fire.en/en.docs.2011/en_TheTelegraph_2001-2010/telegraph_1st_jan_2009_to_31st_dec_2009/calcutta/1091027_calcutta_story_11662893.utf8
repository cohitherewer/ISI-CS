The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Railings broken, stolen
                                                                                                               Railings broken, stolen
          ONTHESPOT - STREET FURNITURE                            Bars missing from railings on Gorachand Road and (right) bars of a roadside railing on Dargah Road allegedly hacked off by the owner of a local garage as they hindered his trade.

	Roadside railings and road dividers in the city disappear as soon as they are installed. Railings on CIT Road, Dargah Road, Suhrawardy Avenue and Congress Exhibition Road are missing every few metres. In some places, parts of railings have been sawed off, in others they have been broken forcibly.        
	Rag-pickers, hawkers, pavement dwellers and drug peddlers turn street furniture into an easy source of money while shopkeepers and others dont bat an eyelid before sawing them off if they come in the way of their trade.         
	A huge racket is at work in the city. From the local councillor, the officers-in-charge of police stations to the top brass in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and Calcutta police, everyone is aware of the problem.        
	Roadside railings are generally sponsored by private companies under the aegis of the city traffic police. But the police, who encourage companies to sponsor the railings, hardly take any effort in guarding them.         
	Road divider railings were erected by the city police near Chittaranjan Hospital and Dargah Road for the safety of pedestrians and commuters by streamlining vehicular movement along the road. But the cops didnt realise that Calcuttans have a habit of crossing roads wherever it suits them. If railings come in their way, the easiest way out is to break free, said S. Chatterjee, a resident of Sundari Mohan Avenue.        
	Along a stretch on CIT Road, the road divider has been reduced to a hollow frame. The civic sense of the people can be judged from the deplorable condition of the roadside railings. I think Calcutta is the most unfortunate city in the world because its citizens do not care. I dont believe that drug peddlers and rag-pickers are solely responsible for this damage, said Zafar Imam of Dargah Road.        
	On Dargah Road, the footpath railing is missing, allegedly hacked away by the owner of a garage in the locality. Cars in need of repairs line up beside the footpath and the garage owner reportedly found it difficult to carry out repairs. He sawed off several bars so he could work unhindered, said local residents.        
	The roadside railing looked good but the garage owner damaged them as it was coming in the way of his business. We dont protest as he seems to wield a lot of clout in the area, said Syed Mohammed Salman Neyaz, a resident of AJC Bose Road.        
	On Suhrawardy Avenue, too, parts of the railings vanished within a few days of being installed. I have seen local shopowners damage the railings to suit their purpose, said Saswati Das, a student of Lady Brabourne College.        
	She said a few days ago, an accident occurred near the college and a part of the road divider was damaged. The mangled railing remained unattended for over a month.        
	On Congress Exhibition Road, the roadside railing has turned into a clothes rack for pavement dwellers.        
	When asked about the missing railings, CMC chief engineer (civil) P.K. Dua pinned the blame on the police. Railings are erected by Calcutta police and the state transport department. The railings are maintained by them too, he said.        
	But the police termed railing theft a part and parcel of the city, which had no permanent solution.         
	Stolen and broken railings are part of Calcuttas cityscape. Sometimes we catch the culprits but there is no permanent solution. Stolen street furniture is an extra burden on Calcutta police, said joint commissioner (traffic) Ranvir Kumar.

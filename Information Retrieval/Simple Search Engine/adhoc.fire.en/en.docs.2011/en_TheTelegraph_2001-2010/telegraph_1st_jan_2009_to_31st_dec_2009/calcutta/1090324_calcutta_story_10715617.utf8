                      The colourful vitality of life   By Dhaneshwar Shah                           Dhaneshwar Shah has an intuitive understanding of the fragile balance in which nature and man co-exist. His bright and exuberant palette serves as a tool to highlight the role that light plays and as an allegorical reminder to value direct perception. His works very subtly convey the conflict between man and nature. They, nonetheless, have the ability to entertain with persistent humour while reminding the viewer of the consequences of not caring. Sunanda Khajurias art is timeless and idyllic. Her sensibilities mirror the magic that she feels in the world around, with its festive leaps and fantastical flights of fancy. The most attractive element in her pictures is their boundless and colourful energy. Joie de vivre, the ongoing exhibition, is a celebration of the works of the two artists.

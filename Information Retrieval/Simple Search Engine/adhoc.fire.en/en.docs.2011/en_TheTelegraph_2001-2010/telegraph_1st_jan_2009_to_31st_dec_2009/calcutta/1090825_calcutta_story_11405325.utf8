The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Metro birth pangs
                                                                                                               Metro birth pangs
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Insurance adviser Saugata Pal, 35, would reach Park Street Metro station from Rabindra Sarobar in less than 15 minutes. On Monday, he was forced to wait over 20 minutes at Rabindra Sarobar before a jam-packed train arrived from Garia Bazar (Kavi Nazrul) at 12.42am.        
	This is ridiculous. I take the Metro because it saves me time. Whats the point in taking the Metro if a train arrives 20 minutes late? wondered Saugata.        
	He was not the only one. Metro Railways two-day-old southern extension extended the waiting time for commuters throughout the day, leaving them stranded at one station for up to 25 minutes.         
	According to officials, snags in the signalling system at Naktala (Gitanjali) station and Birji (Shahid Khudiram) paralysed services during peak hours.         
	The signalling systems at Naktala and Birji malfunctioned around 10am, resulting in a train being stranded at Naktala for over 25 minutes. That delayed all other trains over the next few hours, said a senior official of Metro Railway.        
	Trains also took longer than the stipulated time to change tracks at Birji and return to the starting point, Garia Bazar, to pick up passengers.         
	The problem was solved by late afternoon and trains operated normally, the official said.        
	Although Birji is the last stop on the new route, passenger services are presently available only till Garia Bazar.         
	J.K. Mitra, the chief operating officer of Metro Railway, described the train delays on the second day of the extended service as birth pangs.        
	We have deployed officials at those two stations (Naktala and Birji) to monitor the signalling system over the next seven days and fix the problem, he said.        
	Two additional rakes were pressed into service on Monday  the average daily deployment is 14  to ease the pressure created by the delays.              
	But problems resurfaced around 6.30pm when another train took over 10 minutes to change tracks at Birji and return to Garia Bazar.        
	Electronics dealer Anindita Ghosh, who arrived at her store later than usual because of the signalling snags in the morning, fumed in frustration at being delayed at Chandni Chowk Metro station again in the evening.        
	I waited 20 minutes in the morning for a train and I have been here for around 15 minutes already, she complained.        
	Around 100 passengers with tickets for destinations beyond Tollygunge staged an impromptu demonstration when the last south-bound train was terminated there around 10.20pm. Metro officials claimed that announcements were made at every station that the train would not proceed beyond Tollygunge.        
	Some passengers apparently didnt pay heed, an official said.        
	He failed to explain why personnel manning the counters sold tickets for destinations beyond Tollygunge if such a decision had been taken.        
	The longest queues for tickets earlier in the day were at three of the new stations  Garia Bazar, Naktala and Bansdroni. It was as if I was taking the Bongaon local instead of a Metro train, laughed Ritam Basu, a student of Calcutta University        
	Doors not closing properly because of passengers leaning on them added to the delays. Some passengers complained about wrong announcements at a few stations on the extended route. I heard an announcement about the platform being on the right at Masterda Surya Sen station when it should have been left. Metro officials should quickly resolve these problems, said Arijit Mukherjee, a resident of Garia.        
	Bike mishap: Two persons were injured when the motorcycle they were riding was hit by a vehicle at the CR Avenue-Colootola Street crossing on Monday morning.

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Two men were arrested on Tuesday for allegedly cheating a trader of Rs 1.1 crore by offering to sell him land in Rajarhat.        
	Police said property agents Robin Ghosh and Sadek Goldar, in their 30s, had introduced Shyam Sunder Dalal, who owns a city-based infrastructure firm, to Mohammad Ismail Molla, who claimed to be the owner of a four-bigha plot in Rajarhat.        
	Dalal visited the plot and agreed to pay Rs 1.1 crore for it. The trio promised to search the plot and even register it once the payment was made. They showed Dalal documents pertaining to the land, which were forged. Molla had sold the plot earlier. He conspired with the two to dupe Dalal, said city detective chief Jawed Shamim.        
	Molla and Ghosh were arrested in Rajarhat. Goldar is absconding.

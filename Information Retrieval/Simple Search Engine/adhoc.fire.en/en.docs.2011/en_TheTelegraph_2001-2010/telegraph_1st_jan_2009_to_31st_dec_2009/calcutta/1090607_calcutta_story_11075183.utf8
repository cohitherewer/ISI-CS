The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Environment plan, again
                                                                                                               Environment plan, again
                              A polluting autorickshaw                            
	On World Environment Day on Friday, the state government again spoke of things that it has for years gone by.         
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee stressed the need to impose restrictions on grossly polluting industries like sponge iron, encourage alternate power sources such as the solar and the wind; stressed the need to go for green automobile fuel and work out strategy, with the health department, to counter the menace of vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue.         
	He said that the crop pattern in Bengal needs to be altered in the face of climatic change: I have been constantly in touch with agricultural expert M.S. Swaminathan. Availability of drinking water may also become a key issue with rivers drying up.         
	Compare this with what was said in 2007. At a seminar on World Environment Day the state government had said it was planning to make it mandatory for all autorickshaws in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area to run on LPG.        
	The environment minister had said production, sale and use of plastic bags of less than 40 micron in thickness would be banned. The chief minister had added: According to an international report, 23 countries will be affected by the rise in the sea level (because of global warming). India is on the list. The Sunderbans is stated to be under danger. But in the absence of adequate data, it is impossible to assess the situation.        
	In 2008, Citu had called a bandh, possibly sparing the government of the need to make more promises.         
	The chief minister, however, admitted on Friday: Both public health engineering department and the department of science and technology work in arsenic pollution but there is little networking.        
	We will hold our breath and spare the environment some pollution to see what the state government does now, especially in the aftermath of Aila.                     JAYANTA BASU

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Graffiti wins Wall War II   Different strokes
                                                                                                               Graffiti wins Wall War II     - Lax vigil in civic poll unshackles paintbrush brigade          SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE                          A defaced wall in the Rajarhat-Gopalpur municipal area. (Soumen Bhattacharjee)                                        
	The graffiti-free walls that the Election Commission had protected from the paintbrush brigade during the parliamentary poll have been defaced with impunity in the run-up to Sundays municipal elections.        
	Officials in North and South 24-Parganas claim to have warned political parties weeks ago against writing graffiti without permission. But hardly any private wall in the suburbs has escaped being scarred by poll slogans in the past couple of weeks.        
	So with three days to go for polling, how many complaints have piled up against violators? None.        
	The reason? Officials allegedly never told people where they could lodge complaints.         
	Supporters of all three candidates in my ward wrote graffiti and put up posters on my wall without my permission. I wanted to complain but had no idea who to meet, said Saroj Gupta, a resident of ward No. 25 of Rajarhat-Gopalpur Municipality.         
	A source blamed the state poll panel for parties defacing walls and getting away with it, barely two months after an election in which they were forced to seek permission before violating a wall.         
	The Election Commission has no say in local polls, and the onus was on the state poll panel to issue a clear directive to district officials on what to do. It didnt, he added. State election commissioner S.N. Raychowdhury contested the allegation. We have authorised prosecution wherever necessary. District officials know what is required of them and should, therefore, act accordingly.                                      
	Binod Kumar, the district magistrate of North 24-Parganas, said his office had issued a circular to parties on May 24 informing them about the graffiti rule. We told them if they did not clean defaced walls, we would do it and send the bill to them.        
	What about informing people how they could complain? We hired autorickshaws to make announcements over loudspeakers. But I admit we could not match what the Election Commission had done, said Kumar.        
	A homemaker in ward No. 2 of Dum Dum Municipality said she had heard no such announcement. Trinamul activists wrote on my wall, and I dare not question them because they know there is no Election Commission watching them.        
	 With inputs from Meghdeep Bhattacharyya

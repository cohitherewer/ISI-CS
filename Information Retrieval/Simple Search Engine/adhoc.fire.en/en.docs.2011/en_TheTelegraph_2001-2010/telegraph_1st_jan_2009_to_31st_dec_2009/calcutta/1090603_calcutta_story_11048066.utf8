The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cops plan anti-terror school
                                                                                                               Cops plan anti-terror school
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta police have sought about 50 acres near Rajarhat from the state government to set up a counter-terrorism training school.        
	The school will train our men to fight terrorists at close quarters and in built-up areas. Recruits would also be taught to operate in jungles and water and prevent attacks from rivers. The training would be tailor-made and intensive. Our boys have not been imparted such training before, said a senior officer of Calcutta police.        
	The residential school will house a firing range, a state-of-the-art gymnasium, observation posts and drill and training sheds.         
	The project has been estimated to cost about Rs 55 crore with recurring expenditure of about Rs 7.8 crore per year. The state government is expected to forward the proposal to the Centre for funds, added the senior officer.        
	The Union home ministry had announced after the Mumbai attacks last November that the police forces in the four metro cities would be upgraded.         
	The Calcutta police top brass expect funds earmarked for the purpose to be allotted to set up the counter-terrorism school         
	We have already set up a Special Task Force and want to start the training school as soon as possible. According to the plan, a deputy commissioner of police will be in charge of the school, said a senior official of the state home department. We would like to have everything in place and obtain the best training material before the school is launched, he added.        
	Senior police officers have got in touch with their counterparts in the NSG, BSF and the army for guidance in giving shape to the proposal. Modern equipment is also being sourced for the facility.        
	Since the American Center attack, which had exposed the polices vulnerability to terror attacks, select officers have been sent outside Bengal for specialised training. The proposed school will train these officers in future, said cops.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Virtual list of blood donors
                                                                                                               Virtual list of blood donors
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Shipra Ghosh (name changed), a thalassaemic teenager, got HIV from a blood transfusion shortly after recovering from Hepatitis C that she had contracted after an earlier transfusion        
	Cancer patient Abdul Hakim Mollah, whose blood is of the rare Bombay group, needs about eight units of blood for an urgent surgery but cannot track down donors        
	The Rotary Club of Calcutta Mahanagar is set to launch an online database of blood donors, which promises to prevent a repeat of what happened to Shipra and provide a ray of hope to those like Abdul.        
	Members of the club have been visiting offices and schools to enlist donors. Over 4,500 people have signed up. Donors can register online at www.rotarycalmahanagar.org.        
	We are not storing blood. We will upload on our website the names of the donors and blood groups. When people call us for blood, we in turn will get in touch with potential donors. Once a donor is identified, he or she will be asked to meet the patient and donate blood, said Rita Jhawar, the secretary of Rotary Mahanagar.        
	According to her, a virtual donor list ensures that blood is not wasted, as is often the case. Also, since the process is transparent and allows a recipient to test donated blood, the chance of infection is minimal.        
	The response has been very good at the social clubs, corporate offices and educational institutions we visited. If a prospective donor doesnt know his blood group, we carry out a test to find out the information, said Sarla Totla, the co-chairperson of the project.        
	At Ramakrishna Mission College, Narendrapur, one of the institutes the Rotarians visited recently, 138 students signed up as donors.

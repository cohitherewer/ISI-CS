                                                                                                               College adopts Sunderbans village
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	St Xaviers College, Calcutta, has decided to adopt a village in the Sunderbans for the next one year to help its Aila- affected residents.        
	A team from the college will visit Kalinagar village with the first round of relief material on June 23.        
	Students, alumni members and staff will help rebuild houses, schools and anything else required for the rehabilitation of the victims.        
	The relief work in the village will continue over the next one year. The college is working with Seva Kendra, an NGO that is already working in the Sunderbans.        
	The relief materials the team will carry include non-perishable food items like rice, pulses and baby food; medicine; clothes and drinking water.        
	The items  to be collected from the teachers, students and alumni  will be ferried to the village on a weekly basis.        
	There is an active youth group in the area and we will work with them to draw up the plans for relief and rehabilitation, said Cheryl Francis, the director of social work and National Service Scheme of the college.        
	Many of our non-teaching employees are from the Sunderbans. We would like to help them and others who have been affected by the cyclone, said Father Felix Raj, the principal of the college.        
	The whole college and everyone associated with it are part of the relief work but we have identified a core team which will be directly responsible for the mission, added Francis.         
	The college is now closed for summer vacation. Even when it reopens we will continue with the relief work. Students can be excused from class if necessary and we will use the weekends to reach relief to the victims.         
	St Xaviers College (Calcutta) Alumni Association is organising a concert on June 26 to raise funds for the relief work in the Sunderbans.         
	Co-ordinated by musician and alumnus Subhen Chatterjee, Concert for a Cause is expected to draw a host of prominent names in the field.        
	Usha Uthup, Bandish Fusion by Subhen Chatterjee and KARMA, the fusion band with Raghav Chatterjee, Swapan Bose, Miss Jojo, Devshankar, Sambit and others, hip pocket, orient express, Krosswindz, Cactus, Lakkhichara, Dohar, Rupankar, Shilajit and Prateek Chowdhury are among the performers.        
	The concert is open for all and will be held at the college auditorium from 5pm. The donation collected at the concert will be used for relief work, said Firdausal Hassan, the secretary of the alumni association.         
	The college plans to adopt two more villages in the Sunderbans over the next year.

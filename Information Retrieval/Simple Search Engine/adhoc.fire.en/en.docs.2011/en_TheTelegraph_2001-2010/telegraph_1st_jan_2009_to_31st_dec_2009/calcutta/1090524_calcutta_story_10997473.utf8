The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Beauty and the beast 
                                                                                                               Beauty and the beast 
										      eyewitness                        Works by Mahjabin Majumdar and Arghya Priya Majumdar	(below).			                                 
	The exhibition of Arghya Priya Majumdar along with Mahjabin Majumdar at Ganges art gallery could be seen as a study in contrasts. The works of this Santiniketan-based couple could not have been more different. Whereas Arghya Priyas accent is on the grotesque, Mahjabins paintings are like delicate swatches of intricately worked lace, where the details tell stories that she weaves not only by appropriating ideas she thinks fit but by using visual imagery as well.         
	Arghya Priyas drawing and colours are dynamic, robust and bright. On the other hand, Mahjabin makes a limited use of colours  either various shades of red, heliotrope and yellow, or yellow and blue with touches of green.        
	Arghya Priyas grotesques, sometimes individuals, sometimes in clusters, leer at viewers with demoniac glee. They are bald and have drooping noses. With overhanging bellies and claw-like hands and toes they are close to the figures of the devil in Buddhist art  evil reduced to caricature. The livid colours in which they are depicted are also indicative of their status as creatures denied enlightenment.        
	Mahjabins world is more poetic and inward-looking. Fairy tale creatures appear in her acrylic paintings. These are very painstakingly created with delicate lines and dots that give them their fragile appearance. Blood courses through the veins of human beings Chaucer-fashion, and images associated with spring  fluttering humming birds and flowers and saplings bursting out of seeds  appear before them. If one looks at the details, however, one discovers that this is not really paradise. Serpents have invaded this garden. She uses the winged beings as part of her imagery as she does calligraphy, but by no means to exoticise her work. For in between, we encounter organs of the human body that could not have been more mundane. In another painting, a womans eyes blink, as if in disbelief. In yet another shoals of fish swim through flowers. Reality and fantasy mingle effortlessly in these paintings and Mahjabin takes a canny look at both.               
	Like hundreds of other artists in Bengal, fairy tales, fantasies and myths are the ingredients with which Mustak Khan Chowdhury builds up his paintings. There is no harm in doing that so long as the artist takes the trouble of looking at this from some new angle.         
	Unfortunately, Khan Chowdhury does not seem up to it. So, all we get is a rehash of stock material exploited for generations. One can also detect the influence of a Bengal artist who is a big name. There is just one painting which is worth taking a second look at  that of two young people close to each other. It is at least without cliches.       SD

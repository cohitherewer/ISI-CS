                                                                                                               A gasp amp; clasp from Sita
  - Raavan sena surrounds Bachchan bahu who will stay in Rajarhat and shoot in Agarpara          A STAFF REPORTER                          ASH MONDAY: Aishwarya Rai Bachchan is stunned by the flashbulb frenzy at the airport. Pictures by Aranya Sen                                        
	Read those LOreal lips. Hai Ram? Hai Raavan? Or Oh my God?        
	A gasp  complete with right hand clasped to the heart  escaped the perfect pink pout of Aishwarya Rai Bachchan on Monday evening after she stepped out of the airport and into a flashbulb frenzy.        
	Dressed in a white top, jeans and brown shades, Mani Ratnams Sita  in his work-in-progress film to be shot here over a fortnight  was surrounded by a Raavan sena of around 25 securitymen as she emerged from the main gate of the airport after touching down in town at 7.45pm.                      
	Stunned by the camera craze that greeted her, she could barely whisper an exclamation before being whisked into a silver Innova that sped off towards Vedic Village.        
	At the Rajarhat resort where Team Raavan is camping, a security cordon had been formed much before Aishwarya had left the airport to prevent outsiders from sneaking in.              
	The Bachchan bahu zoomed in a little after 8.15pm and went straight to the villa where she is scheduled to stay till the end of the month  and where the Bachchan beta, playing Raavan, will soon join her.        
	Hours before the Raavan sena was flexing its muscles at the airport and Vedic Village, it was doing much the same at Saheb Kuthi, the Agarpara bungalow on the banks of the Hooghly where much of Ratnams contemporary take on the epic tale told from Raavans perspective will be shot.        
	The day after Metro had managed a tour of the sets, the big blue gate was shut tight and a police van remained parked in the compound. A Hindi song blared from the speakers from morning as some female dancers could be glimpsed rehearsing inside the bungalow. A little before sundown, the pre-shoot action shifted to the river as some dancers clambered on a wooden dinghy to practise their steps. Ash is scheduled to shoot at Saheb Kuthi this week.        
	With the Tamil version of the film, Ashokavanam, being shot simultaneously, a star parade is set to trundle through town  from Rajarhat to Agarpara  throughout February. But all eyes will be on AshAbhi, of course.

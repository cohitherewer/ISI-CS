The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Next weekend you can be at ... Ayodhya Hills
                                                                                                               Next weekend you can be at ... Ayodhya Hills
                                          
	Do not be misled by the name  this does not refer to Ayodhya, the birthplace of Lord Rama. The Ayodhya Hills of Purulia take the name after a zamindar of the area, Ayodhya Singh. Standing at 2,000 ft above sea-level, Ayodhya Hills is an extension of the Dolma Hills of Jharkhand. It is an extremely picturesque getaway with hills, dales, tall trees, springs, tranquil lakes, a river and clear blue skies. There is a crispness and freshness in the air, which is invigorating. The rugged terrain makes it at an ideal destination for rock-climbing and trekking, but you can also just relax and soak in natures beauty.        
	We set out by car in the morning, stopping to feast on the famous langchas (fried sweets) of Saktigarh and lunch at a roadside dhaba. We reached Ayodhya Hills by evening, having taken the Durgapur Expressway.                             
	The roads are in pretty good condition. We checked into Niharika guesthouse of the West Bengal Comprehensive Area Development Corporation. It offers comfortable accommodation with homely food. The next morning we set out for the Bamni Falls after a hearty breakfast of piping hot luchis, potato curry and home-made local sweets at a small eatery. A bumpy ride and a climb past huge boulders and rocks brought us to the beautiful falls gurgling down and losing itself far below amid rocks and green foliage. Smaller waterfalls also dot the area.         
	While we travelled, a sight that often met our eyes was a line of lithe Santhal women walking gracefully carrying heavy loads of firewood on their heads. We even heard snatches of Jhumur, their lilting folksong, as they walked by. We went through a Santhal village, marvelling at the beauty of the tribals impeccably plastered mud huts with motifs painted on the walls.         
	The people were friendly, though the women were shy. A group of smiling children readily posed for our cameras. We also visited Chorida village in Bagmundi, the dwelling place of artisans who create the famous and colourful Chhau masks.         
	We bought small masks as souvenirs.        
	We ambled about, delighting in the scenic beauty. The picturesque setting with hills in the distance, a river flowing by gently, grassy red land dotted with tall shady trees of sal, mohua, palash and teak against an azure blue background all glimmering in the bright sunshine remains etched in our minds eye.        
	Going         
	There are several trains from Howrah to Purulia. Bus services are also available from Sahid Minar. You can go by car, too

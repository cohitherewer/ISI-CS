The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Court asks Memorial to clarify Victoria link
                                                                                                               Court asks Memorial to clarify Victoria link
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          Victoria Memorial Hall                                   
	Victoria Memorial Hall will have to inform the high court whether it is empowered to buy and display items not related to Queen Victoria or her reign.        
	The division bench of Justice B. Bhattacharya and Justice Tapan Dutt, which passed the order on Thursday, pointed out that the monument was a memorial hall but was being used as a general museum.        
	Clarify before the court what law empowers the authorities to purchase and keep articles that have no links with the memories of Queen Victoria and her era, the bench ordered.        
	The institution functions under the Victoria Memorial Act, 1903, which states that the building would serve as a memorial of the life and reign of Her Late Majesty Victoria of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and Queen Empress of India.        
	The court was hearing a plea by the authorities to allow the construction of a three-storeyed cultural complex on the premises.        
	Opposing the plea, green activist Subhash Dutta submitted that though the issue was sub judice, the Memorial authorities were spending large sums of taxpayers money on buying articles which they intended displaying in the proposed complex.        
	The articles bought, according to Duttas list, include portraits and caricatures of Bengali novelists by Rebati Bhushan Ghosh (Rs 6 lakh), a portrait by Tagore (Rs 15.5 lakh), two paintings by Jamini Roy (Rs 8.5 lakh) and paintings by various artists purchased from Shyamasree Tagore (Rs 7.5 lakh).        
	The authorities will reply on the next date of hearing.

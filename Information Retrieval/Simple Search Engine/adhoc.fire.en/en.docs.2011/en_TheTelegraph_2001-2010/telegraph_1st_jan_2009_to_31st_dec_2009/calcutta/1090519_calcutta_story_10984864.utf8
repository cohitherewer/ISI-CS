                      Modern mans dilemma                    Human bonds are sadly disintegrating due to the pressures of a highly commercial and competitive way of life. Based on a story by Mohit Chattopadhyay, Shohans latest production, Daaho, explores this unfortunate social phenomenon, but with a difference. Operating on two levels, the play puts forward another contemporary crisis afflicting the world today: the conflict between personal profit and social welfare. The primary action of the play focuses on Tapu, a young man who is estranged from his parents and younger siblings. His father Bhabatosh Sen is the owner of a factory manufacturing tobacco products. Tapu voices his contempt against his fathers wealth that has been accumulated at the cost of endangering the lives of others. He subsides into depression and is eventually sent away for treatment. This activates the second tier of action, and Bhabatosh Sens alter-ego Mr O.K. appears on stage. The alter-ego awakens his conscience; as his relationship with his son reaches a point of no-return, he realises the futility of an opulence amassed from an immoral business. Ultimately, when his son refuses to return home after recovery, Bhabatosh Sen sets his own factory ablaze. A cohesive production with deft portrayal of characters and supported by well-designed visual effects, it promises to offer food for thought to an introspective audience. Direction: Anish Ghosh.                  Event: Play in Bengali, Daaho, produced by Shohan When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Madhusudan Mancha

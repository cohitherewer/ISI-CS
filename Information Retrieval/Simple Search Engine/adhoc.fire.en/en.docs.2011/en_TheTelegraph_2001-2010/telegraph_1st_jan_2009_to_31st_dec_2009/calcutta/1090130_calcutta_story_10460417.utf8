The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Woman in wheelchair hit by cop
                                                                                                               Woman in wheelchair hit by cop
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Tapati at Raj Bhavan.   (Amit Datta)                                        
	An elderly man and his wheelchair-bound daughter, who had gone to Raj Bhavan to seek help for her treatment from the governor, were allegedly manhandled by a cop on Thursday afternoon.        
	Tapati, 45, fell off the wheelchair and bruised her hand after being allegedly pushed by assistant sub-inspector Gautam Nag in front of her 80-year-old father Arun Dutta, who looked on helplessly.        
	After hearing about the incident, the governors office asked the police to let in the duo who did not have any prior appointment. Officials soon called a doctor who examined Tapati. She was given first-aid. The father later wrote a letter seeking help from the governor, said an official.        
	Departmental proceedings have been started against Nag. Exemplary action will be taken if he is found guilty, said joint police commissioner Pradip Chatterjee.        
	Dutta said he and Tapati were waiting near the north gate of Raj Bhavan around 1pm when a policeman, later identified as Gautam Nag, shouted at them, asking them to leave the place. Their fault: the wheelchair was allegedly obstructing the north gate.        
	Dutta, a retired central government employee, told the cop that he and his mentally and physically-challenged daughter had come to seek help for her treatment from Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi.        
	The policeman pushed the wheelchair. My daughter fell on the road. Her left hand was bruised and she started bleeding, recalled Dutta.                          
	When I protested, the cop manhandled me, the Behala resident added.        
	Dutta, who said he had spent lakhs on his daughters treatment without any result, told the cop that they had come to narrate the pathetic condition of government hospitals to the governor. The state healthcare system has collapsed. National Medical College and Hospital has turned away my daughter, he said.        
	Witnesses said that as the altercation continued, the cop pushed Tapatis wheelchair while his colleagues looked on. We were shocked to see a policeman manhandling a challenged woman, said Tuhin Banerjee, a witness.

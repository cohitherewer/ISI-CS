The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Remote car-fume check
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Remote car-fume check

	Owners of polluting vehicles beware, your cars carbon count is being secretly measured even as you belch around town.        
	The campaign against foul fumes has gone undercover to catch violators of emission norms through a remote-sensing sensor installed in a white Force Traveller that scans the tailpipes of vehicles from vantage points in the heart of the city.        
	Officials of the public vehicles department (PVD), which has chosen a Mumbai-based company to scan emission levels of individual cars, said emission data of close to 30,000 vehicles had already been recorded.         
	Our mission is to try and curb air pollution caused by emission from vehicles. The process has just begun and we will soon start sending computer-generated letters to the defaulters, Subir Bhadra, the director of the PVD, told Metro.         
	Car owners will be given seven to 10 days to lower their vehicles emission levels to the permissible limit and report back to the authorities.        
	The government is spending Rs 6.75 lakh a month on the services of the company assigned the task of scanning tailpipes surreptitiously. The Traveller that does the job is fitted with what looks like a complex gadget, though the technology at work is said to be simple.         
	A sensor with a mirror at the opposite end forms the core of the hi-tech emission cop. Just along the remote-sensing sensor is a small gadget that measures vehicle speed. A small camera is mounted at the end of this composite gadget.         
	The moment a vehicle passes by, its speed is recorded. Then, as the sensor spots the tailpipe, it emits UV rays that capture the fumes and hit the mirror, which reflects the rays back to the sensor. The fume content is immediately recorded on the computer inside the van, an official explained.         
	Computer software is used to analyse the fume content in terms of hydrocarbons, including carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and oxides of nitrogen.         
	This remote-sensing device for measuring auto-emission level is used across the globe, said a senior representative of Environmental Systems Products India Pvt Ltd, the PVDs pollution-check partner.        
	Asok Kumar Maity, the assistant director (technical) of the PVD, said a cars emission analysis result would be compared with the norms stipulated in the Central Motor Vehicles Rules before being sent to the vehicle owner.         
	Although all vehicles are being scanned  the locations as of now are either side of the Park Street flyover and Vidyasagar Setu  PVD officials said the focus of the campaign was commercial four-wheelers.

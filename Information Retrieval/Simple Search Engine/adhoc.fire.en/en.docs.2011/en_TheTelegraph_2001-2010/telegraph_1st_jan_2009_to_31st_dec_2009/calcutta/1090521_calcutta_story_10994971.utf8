The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Reel-life action for real
                                                                                                               Reel-life action for real
          PRONAB MONDAL                          The stretch of CN Roy Road from where Partha Pratim Roy Burman was kidnapped. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                  
	Yusuf Reza (name changed) loves action movies, and hes seen quite a few where mean-looking men come in cars, fire a few rounds and kidnap the hero, heroine or someone related to them. But the reel-life action hadnt prepared him for what he saw in real life on July 25, 2001.        
	Yusuf still shivers at the thought of how shoe baron Partha Pratim Roy Burman was abducted in front of his eyes that day. Yeh jagah itna badal gaya hai lekin hamari yaadein abhi bhi taaza hain (this place has changed a lot but I still remember everything). It was straight out of the movies  four men surrounded a Tata Safari, shot twice and dragged out a tall man with blood oozing out of his hand. They whisked him away in a Maruti 800, the Tiljala resident recalled.        
	The crossing of CN Roy Road and Sapgachi First Lane, in Tiljala, was where Aftab Ansaris men had intercepted the car carrying the Khadim scion. The area has seen quite a few changes in the past eight years  the 20-foot road has been renovated, and a new meat shop, two saloons and a baby food outlet have come up at the intersection.        
	What hasnt changed is the fear that memories of that abduction invoke.         
	We often see local goons brandishing firearms. But the weapon that one of the abductors fired with that day had a different look. I fled the moment I saw him fire. Arrey bhai, sab ko jaan pyari hain! (Everyone loves his own life!), said Mohammad Shahzada, a young man.         
	Another witness, Sheikh Jamal, said Ansaris men probably wouldnt have been able to make a quick getaway with their hostage had they carried out the abduction in the same area now.        
	Traffic on CN Roy Road has increased five times in the past eight years. More paan kiosks and tea stalls have come up, making the thoroughfare narrower, said Jamal, who manages a telephone booth at the intersection.        
	He was one of the residents who had noticed the four abductors standing beside a white Maruti car parked at the intersection minutes before Roy Burmans car passed by.        
	Residents of the lane are happy that Aftab Ansari and his men have been sentenced to jail for life. If he (Ansari) appeals against the verdict, I hope it is rejected. Underworld dons like him should stay in jail, said Shahzada.

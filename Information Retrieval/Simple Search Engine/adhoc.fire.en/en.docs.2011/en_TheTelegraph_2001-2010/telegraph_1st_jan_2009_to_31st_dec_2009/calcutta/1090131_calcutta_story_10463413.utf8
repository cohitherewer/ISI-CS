The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hijack alert puts airport on its toes
                                                                                                               Hijack alert puts airport on its toes
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Security at Calcutta airport, on a high alert since the Mumbai siege, has been further tightened following a hijack warning from the Centre on Thursday.        
	Officials said all major airports in the country had been alerted after intelligence agencies had warned that terror groups might try to hijack aircraft in an attempt to force the government to release militants.        
	There were no specific instructions in the missive from the home ministry but the number of security personnel has been increased and CCTVs are being monitored round-the-clock, an official said. The hijack alert was part of a general advisory that we receive from the Centre every once in a while, he added.         
	Anyone moving around suspiciously on the airport premises will be intercepted, the official said.         
	Checking and frisking have been made more rigorous in both domestic and international terminals.

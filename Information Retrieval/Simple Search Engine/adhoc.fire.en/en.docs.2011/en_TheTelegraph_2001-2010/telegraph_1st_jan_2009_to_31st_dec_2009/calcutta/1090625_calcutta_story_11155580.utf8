	Soumik Kundu Chowdhury, 27, and his brother Surojit, 25, were arrested on Wednesday for allegedly beating up their 54-year-old mother Sikha. She had filed a plea in the high court after being forced out of their Shyampukur home. The court directed the local police to ensure her security.        
	When Sikha returned to her house on Wednesday, her sons allegedly beat her up and forced her to leave.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Student sleuths to sniff terror threats
                                                                                                               Student sleuths to sniff terror threats
          KINSUK BASU                          Metro report on March 9 on the security booklet for schools                                  
	Students will form a new line of defence in the fight against terror.        
	Police have decided to select students from senior classes in schools and train them in smelling out threats around their institutions.        
	The move follows the rising number of instances of terrorists zeroing in on soft targets. A few weeks ago, the cops had distributed booklets to schools explaining to teachers how to handle crises.        
	The student-sleuths, who will be selected following consultation with their teachers, will be trained by the officer-in-charge of the police station concerned and senior officers from Lalbazar.        
	Once trained, the officers hope, the students will help teachers handle crises, including terror attacks. The police brass have invited representatives of at least 42 schools across the city to attend a meeting in Lalbazar on Thursday to finalise the modalities        
	The idea is to step up security at schools and instil a sense of duty and patriotism into students. There would be designated teachers to look after the activities of these students, said Ranjit Pachnanda, the additional commissioner of police. We will ensure that the students do not lose out on studies in doing this.        
	Schools will be asked to select a core groups comprising five to 10 students each, primarily from senior classes. Officers will train them in keeping a watch around the schools, tracking suspicious movements and helping teachers identify objects or vehicles lying abandoned for long. The students will also educate younger ones on how to remain alert in crisis situations.         
	This idea is very good, said Mukta Nain, the principal of Birla High School, who will attend Thursdays meeting.        
	Sources said an abridged version of the advisory for the teachers is being prepared for the students. The police have proposed that the members of the team be changed at regular intervals so an increasing number of them get an opportunity to be trained in pre-empting an emergency.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Highrise hindrance on flight path
                                                                                                               Highrise hindrance on flight path

	Highrises are mushrooming around the airport in violation of aviation safety rules, posing a threat to residents as well as fliers.        
	The rules stipulate that only single-storey buildings can be constructed within 2-3km of the airport. But a recent survey by Metro revealed that there are at least 12-15 highrise apartment blocks and several private multi-storey buildings under construction within 2km of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport.        
	The areas where rules are violated the most include Kaikhali, on VIP Road, and Michaelnagar, on Jessore Road.        
	In the recent past, the ground proximity warning system of at least three aircraft preparing to land had gone off, hinting at obstacles on or near the flight paths. Sources said several pilots approaching the airport to land had reported having sighted tall buildings close to the flight paths, raising fears of a rerun of the Buffalo mishap.        
	On the night of February 12, 50 people were killed when a Colgan Air flight crashed into a building near Buffalo, New York, after the pilot lost contact with the air traffic control.        
	Airports Authority of India (AAI) officials in Calcutta pleaded helplessness about the potential encroachments on flight paths as no safety survey has been undertaken for the past five years. The survey, by the AAIs cartography department, is supposed to be conducted every two-three years at all airports.        
	In the absence of a survey we have no way of finding out how many obstacles are there around the airport. We have repeatedly conveyed our concern to the AAI headquarters in Delhi but they are yet to get back to us, said a senior airport official.        
	Of the highrises Metro had spotted, two  Aponaloy Apartments and Fortune City  have come up within 1,200 metres of the airport. While Fortune City has 19 five-storey buildings, Aponaloy has six five-storeyed blocks and another under construction.        
	Two highrises were being built near Kaikhali and Airport gate No. 1. The realtors of the Jessore Road estates, however, said they had obtained permission from the AAI and the municipality before starting construction.        
	Apart from the highrises, four building with cellphone towers installed on their terraces were spotted in Michaelnagar, Jessore Road, Kaikhali and Sukantanagar, all within 2km of the airport.        
	The Airtel tower on my roof was installed two years ago. The company had said it had clearances from the authorities concerned. Even the municipality did not object, said Moinuddin Biswas, of Kaikhali, who earns around Rs 9,000 a month from the mobile phone service provider.        
	Airtel CEO (eastern zone) Ajay Puri, however, said: We had obtained permission from the AAI and the municipality. Besides, the tower does not fall in the flying zone.        
	The municipal authorities blamed the mushrooming of highrises on the AAI. The builders approach us with no-objection certificates from the AAI and we have no option but give our consent, said Sachindra Mohan Sarkar, the chairman of North Dum Dum Municipality.        
	The chairman of Rajarhat-Gopalpur municipality, Tapas Chatterjee, asserted he did not allow any construction in the vicinity of the airport without the AAIs consent. I will send officials to verify whether developers are violating the norms.        
	AAI officials said a part of the clearance is processed in Calcutta while the Delhi headquarters gives the other part of the no-objection certificate. Realtors often do not stick to the initial plan. Once the survey reveals the current status, we can crack the whip on violators, said the AAI official in Calcutta.

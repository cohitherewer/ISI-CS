                Angels amp; Demons released only at standalone cinemas with talks between producers Sony Pictures and multiplex operators across the country failing to achieve a breakthrough till late on Friday. Negotiations have failed to arrive at an agreeable revenue-sharing model, said a Sony Pictures representative.     Singapore Airlines has announced economy class return fares of Rs 15,000 (taxes included) from Calcutta to Hong Kong till September 30. Tickets have to be booked between June 1 and 5.    A woman in her early 20s was found lying unconscious beside Kona Expressway, in the Jagachha police station area, on Friday night. Residents spotted the woman, clad in a T-shirt and shorts, and alerted police. She was taken to Howrah District Hospital. Till late on Friday, she could not reveal her identity and say how she got there, said the police.    The citizens group that cleaned poll clutter in the city and flushed muck out of the Lakes, will travel to the Sunderbans on Sunday with a weeks supply of relief material for those left shelterless by Cyclone Aila. We have identified the village on Dayapur island in Satjelia as a pocket that needs immediate attention, said Mudar Patherya, a member of the group.

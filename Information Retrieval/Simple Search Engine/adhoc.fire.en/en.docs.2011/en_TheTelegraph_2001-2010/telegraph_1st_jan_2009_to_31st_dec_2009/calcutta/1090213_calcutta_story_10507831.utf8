	Sudip Ghosh came to the city from Bankura to study physics honours at Jadavpur University. Calcutta proved too expensive to live in and the teenager would have returned home had he not found accommodation with Bidhan Nagar Chatarabas Trust in Salt Lake.        
	Seventeen other youngsters who would not have been able to pursue their dreams if they had to pay for food and lodging in the city have also found a home in the hostel run by the trust.        
	Bimalendu Mustafi, the founder of the trust, came up with the idea of a hostel for underprivileged students. The trust was registered in 1993. We admitted the first student in 2005, said P.N. Guha, a trustee.        
	The hostel was originally conceived as an establishment that would provide economically backward students free accommodation. The trust later decided to provide food and conveyance to students living in the hostel.        
	We realised that only free accommodation would not be enough and so we decided to include food and conveyance, said Guha.        
	The three-storey hostel has single rooms as well as rooms that can accommodate four to five people. The current occupants are from Bankura, the Midnapores, Siliguri and South 24-Parganas and study in Jadavpur University, Bengal Engineering and Science University, City College, Vidyasagar College and Scottish Church College.        
	The trust selects students on the basis of their performance in the board exams and their economic background. We get information about the students from newspapers and NGOs and then approach them. They have to go through a selection procedure, said Guha.        
	Each student is supported by funds collected from donors in the form of scholarships covering accommodation, food, travel and medical expenses.        
	Currently, the trust gets annual donation of Rs 2.5 lakh, with which they support the 18 students. They plan to take in 30 students from the 2009-2010 academic year.

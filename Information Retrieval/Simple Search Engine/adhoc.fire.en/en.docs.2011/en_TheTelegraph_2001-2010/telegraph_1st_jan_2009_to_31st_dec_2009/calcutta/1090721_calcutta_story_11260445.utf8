The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Delay in MA result
                                                                                                               Delay in MA result
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The results of Calcutta Universitys MA Part I and Part II examinations in journalism and mass communication have not been declared over 10 months after the tests ended.        
	The 140-odd students who sat for the exams last September are clueless about when the results would be published. We have no idea why the authorities are taking so long to evaluate the answer scripts of a handful of students. They still have not told us when we can expect the results, said a Part I examinee.        
	The university usually takes two to five months to declare the results of postgraduate examinations.        
	It is unfortunate that we have not been able to declare last years journalism and mass communication results, said CU vice-chancellor Suranjan Das.        
	According to him, the university follows a decentralised examination system for the postgraduate courses, under which the departmental heads oversee the evaluation of answer scripts.        
	I have asked the journalism department to ensure that the evaluation of answer scripts is completed quickly, added Das.         
	The department has only two full-time teachers  Tapati Basu, the head, and CPM legislator Soumendranath Bera.        
	The head of the department has not been keeping well and has not attended the university for several months. The other full-time teacher is busy with his political work, said a student.         
	The students alleged that for the past few months they had been enquiring about the results at the universitys examination department almost daily but to no avail.        
	The worst affected are the Part I examinees, who are scheduled to sit for their Part II in September.        
	Part II is knocking on the doors and I still do not know how I fared in Part I, said a second-year student of the course.        
	Bera and Basu were not available for comment.

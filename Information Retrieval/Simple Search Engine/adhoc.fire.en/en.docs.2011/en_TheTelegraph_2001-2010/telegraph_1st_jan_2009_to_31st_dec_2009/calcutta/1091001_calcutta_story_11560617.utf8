                      Sacrifice and slaughter                    A blend of black comedy, melodrama, horror and bleak tragedy, Rang Roops latest production, Jalchhabi, explores themes of survival, hope, despair and death. The entire action of the play takes place in a shabby, poorly-lit kitchen, reflecting the claustrophobia of its central characters. The Bengali adaptation of Martin McDonaghs The Beauty Queen of Leenane, it introduces the audience to Mrinmoyee, a 40 year-old spinster who takes care of her old and infirm mother. A beauty in the days of her youth, she was sought after by many in the past. But the responsibility of looking after her family after her fathers death, coupled with various other adversities, took its toll on her. Now, while her sisters have escaped into marriage and family life, Mrinmoyee, with a history of mental illness, is trapped in a seriously dysfunctional relationship with her selfish and manipulative mother. Her hopes of romance and happiness are raised when Poto, an old friend of hers, proposes to marry her. But that is not to be as her mother destroys a letter that Poto had written to her. When Mrinmoyee learns about this, she realises to her horror, that the glimmer of a last-chance romance has also been extinguished. She can no longer retain her mental composure and, in a fit of fury and hatred, she kills her mother. Direction: Seema Mukhopadhyay.

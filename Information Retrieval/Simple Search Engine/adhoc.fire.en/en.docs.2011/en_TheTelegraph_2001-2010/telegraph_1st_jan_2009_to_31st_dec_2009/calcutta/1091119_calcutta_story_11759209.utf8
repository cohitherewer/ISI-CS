The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tick-tock rebels at Writers
                                                                            Thursday , November 19 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Tick-tock rebels at Writers
          ANINDYA SENGUPTA AND ZEESHAN JAWED                      The clock shows 5.05 on Wednesday afternoon but this office room at Writers rsquo; is near-empty ahead of time. Picture by Amit Datta                          
	A few flashbulbs did what the new attendance code for Writers Buildings employees could not do on the first day of the extended work clock.        
	Lower division assistant Soumen Sikdar (name changed) and some colleagues had packed up well ahead of the scheduled 5.30pm closing time, as usual, on Wednesday when the arrival of some photographers and a TV crew sent them scurrying back to their seats.        
	Please chhobi chhapben na. Ei niyom ki maana jaye? (Please dont publish these pictures. Are these rules practical), pleaded one of the employees.        
	Excuses then flew thick and fast, ranging from the predictable to the absurd.        
	I feel claustrophobic whenever I board a Metro train. So I take a bus to office and back. I usually leave office by 4.30pm to escape the evening traffic snarls and reach home (on the southern fringes) by 6pm, Sikdar, in his early fifties, said.              
	A colleague cited paucity of time to buy fish for his inability to spend more time in office while another said his decision not to comply with the new work schedule was a show of defiance.        
	Let Asimbabu (finance minister Asim Dasgupta) clear our dearness allowance arrears before implementing such illogical rules, said a member of the West Bengal Government Employees Union (Nabaparjya).        
	Some even staged sit-ins, and it seemed to put the government under pressure. According to an official assessment of compliance on Wednesday, most employees reported for work on time and attendance was satisfactory.         
	Finance minister Dasgupta, the architect of the attendance code, said: Attendance was satisfactory on the first day. People came in early compared with other days and in many departments they were queuing up a little after 10am to sign the register. We will monitor compliance regularly for a week.        
	If everything was going like clockwork, why were babus across departments heckling journalists and ducking photographers late in the afternoon?        
	Thats because they were all raring to go home early and the government wasnt complaining, but the cameras were watching, said a senior official.        
	Office timings for the majority of the employees are 10am to 5.30pm with a grace period of 15 minutes. According to the new code, if an employee comes in late for more than three days in a month he or she would have to forfeit a days casual leave.         
	The order states that the secretary of the department concerned should identify an officer for monitoring implementation of these instructions and submit daily reports to the secretary. But the unions representing the employees have alleged that these secretaries and the higher officials themselves come in late.         
	On Wednesday, the agriculture, finance, audit and animal husbandry departments accounted for the maximum number of latecomers.         
	Manoj Kanti Guha, the joint co-ordinator of the State Government Employees Co-ordination Committee, accused senior officials of not leading by example. We encourage people to report for work on time. But what about the senior officials who are provided cars by the government? They come in late as well, he said.         
	A veteran on the verge of retirement said Writers was burdened by the legacy of late attendance. When I joined government service in the late Seventies, our seniors used to tell us not to report late for duty. After putting in six-eight years, we began coming late and nobody asked us why. Gradually, that became the norm. Now enforcing attendance rules will be really difficult , he added.

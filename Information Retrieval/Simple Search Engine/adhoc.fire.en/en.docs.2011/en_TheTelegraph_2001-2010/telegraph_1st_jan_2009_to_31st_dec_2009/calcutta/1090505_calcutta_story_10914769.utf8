The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Schools suffer poll spit amp; polish
                                                                                                               Schools suffer poll spit amp; polish

	Schools in Calcutta may not take a leaf out of Sachin Haldars book of poll protest, but they would urge the Election Commission to at least clean up the mess before they exit the premises this time.        
	Schools bear the brunt of the commissions callousness with everything from the classrooms to the toilets having to be set right once the poll storm passes.        
	Over the past 15 years or so, our school is being used as a polling station and after every election, we have to shell out money to clean up the campus, says Malini Bhagat, the principal of Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School, off Park Circus.        
	The polling officers need to be trained on how to use a school premises properly, stresses an official of Our Lady Queen of the Mission on Syed Amir Ali Avenue. We put up Dont Spit notices on the walls but it is of no use, he adds.        
	Spit marks of gutka, paan and khaini, cigarette butts and bidis litter schools the day after the elections. Every time they promise to clean up the campus before handing it over to the school authorities but that never happens, points out G.S. Panda, the administrator of St Augustine Days School.        
	According to the Election Commission rules, polling officers must ensure that the school premises are handed over in proper condition.         
	It is our duty to cooperate with the Election Commission, but after the polling we have to take on the entire responsibility for cleaning up the premises, rues Krishna Damani of South Point school.        
	Will it be any different after May 13? Chief electoral officer Debashis Sen promises it will. It is really unfair (on the schools). We will definitely ensure cleanliness. This time the commission will take extra care so that the school authorities do not face such problems, he says.        
	The citys students will be watching.

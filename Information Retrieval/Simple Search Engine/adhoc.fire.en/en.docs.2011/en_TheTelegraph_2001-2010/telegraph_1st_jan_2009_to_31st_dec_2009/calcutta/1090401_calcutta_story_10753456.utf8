The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Loan suicide in office
                                                                                                               Loan suicide in office
          A STAFF REPORTER                           Pulak Chatterjee, who was found dead                                  
	The cashier of a co-operative credit society was found hanging in his Alipore office on Monday evening, a 13-page note suggesting suicide caused by unpaid loans he had extended to colleagues without keeping proper records.        
	The family of Pulak Chatterjee, however, cried murder. There were injury marks on the body. We believe he was murdered, said Ramen Chatterjee, the elder brother of Pulak, a work assistant in the PWDs civic construction wing.        
	Hastings officer-in-charge Ashoke Banerjee, however, said: His fingers were clenched and his toe was pointing downwards, suggesting suicide. No one has lodged a complaint.        
	The 42-year-old was found hanging from the ceiling in the office of Alipore Divisional Employees Co-operative Credit Society on Commissariat Road. In the 13-page note, be blamed his suicide on two senior office-bearers of the society who had threatened him on March 27 for the mismatch in the books.        
	Chatterjee, the father of a nine-year-old boy, also wrote that he had recently been diagnosed with liver cancer but not disclosed this to his family.        
	The resident of Mahestala had joined the PWD in 1992 as a Group D employee and became treasurer of the cooperative society the next year.         
	Colleagues said Chatterjee, whose office is in Hastings House in Alipore, looked after the societys accounts for free.        
	In the suicide note, found in the bag he had carried to the Commissariat Road office, Chatterjee said he had illegally extended loans worth lakhs from the societys account to several of his colleagues, most of whom had sought money citing emergencies.        
	He stated that he had not kept any record of the loans, hoping the beneficiaries would keep their word and return the money on time. But none apparently did so, forcing Chatterjee to borrow from banks and an acquaintance to bridge the gap in the books.        
	The note does not mention the amount he had borrowed from banks but says he had repaid Rs 3 lakh to the acquaintance though an equal amount was still due.        
	Among the off-the-record beneficiaries of Chatterjees largesse was one who had taken Rs 2 lakh, promising to repay the amount in a month. He didnt.        
	Then came another person who allegedly armtwisted Chatterjee into giving him Rs 50,000, threatening to blow the whistle on the earlier transaction.        
	A desperate Chatterjee, as the note revealed, finally got in touch with the senior office-bearers of the society. On March 27, two of them called him to a room, threatened him and forced him to sign a piece of paper without revealing its contents.        
	Chatterjee, the note says, had slipped into depression since.

	To bring down the number of deaths by drowning, the Rashtriya Life Saving Society, India, conducted an 11-day training at Tallah Jheel Park.         
	The objective was to save lives and increase the number of first responders  people who can do first aid or take necessary steps when theres an accident, instead of being passive bystanders, said Pradipta Ghosal, the vice-president of the Societys eastern headquarters.         
	The four-hour daily session guided the trainees in rescuing techniques, first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation, with separate lessons for swimmers and non-swimmers. We have been conducting this training camp in the Jadavpur Stadium Swimming Pool Complex since 2007, but we wanted a centre in north Calcutta as very few from this part of the city sign up. Tallah Jheel Park was ideal for the purpose because we wanted to train people in natural water bodies, said Ghosal.         
	The group of 36 trainees included swimmers, trainers from College Square and Tallah Jheel Park, and army personnel from Jammu and Kashmir.         
	During wars, we have to make bridges over rivers at times. This knowledge will come in handy if someone falls into the water, said Y.P. Reddy of the J amp;K regiment.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Youth found dead near railway tracks
                                                                                                               Youth found dead near railway tracks
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The body of a 32-year-old accountant from Bally, with a deep wound on the back of his head, was found beside railway tracks near Santragachhi station on Sunday morning.        
	Kaushik Pals family members identified the body and alleged that he had been murdered. Police have registered an unnatural death case.        
	Kaushik left the electrical goods shop where he worked for his sisters house in Dasnagar on Saturday evening, said elder brother Partha.        
	Around 8.30pm, Kaushik called up our brother-in-law Sidhartha and said he would reach his house in 30 minutes. When he didnt reach in an hour, Sidhartha called him and found his phone switched off.        
	According to Partha, when he dialled Kaushiks number around 11pm, someone took the call and promptly disconnected. The phone was switched off after that.        
	Kaushik, who lived in his aunts house, left for the shop as usual around 8.30am, saying he would go over to his sisters in the evening. The youths family members ruled out the possibility of him falling off a train. There are very few passengers in Howrah-bound trains in the evening. Also, Kaushik never stood near the gate, so there is no chance of him leaning out and being hit by a railway post. Had that happened, the injury would have been on his face and not on the back of his head, said Partha.        
	Kaushiks family members found out about the accident from television.        
	We came to know from a news channel that a youths body was found beside the railway tracks between Ramrajatala and Santragachhi stations near Kadamtala. We contacted the Government Railway Police and identified the body, said Partha.        
	The police said the post-mortem report would shed light on the nature of injuries on the body.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Arab, Asian versions of Ibsen 
                                                                                                               Arab, Asian versions of Ibsen 
										      stage                        Senjuti Mukhopadhyay as Ranjabati Sen in the Aarshi adaptation of Hedda Gabler. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha				                           
	We have had Dasachakra (An Enemy of the People adapted by Santi Basu) and Putul Khela (A Dolls House) directed by Sombhu Mitra, and we have had Bidehee (Ghosts) directed by Ajitesh Bandyopadhyay. More recently we had Kaushik Sens Moydanab (Master Builder adapted by Tarapada Roy) and Putuler Chithi (a juxtaposition of Strir Patra and A Dolls House by Bibhas Chakraborty) directed by Abanti Chakraborty.         
	It could be interesting to understand why some plays are preferred over others. Hedda Gabler has remained a script as Ajit Gangopadhyays Shakuntala Ray, as has Wild Duck in an adaptation by Santi Basu.         
	Ibsen Through New Eyes, a three-day seminar and 10-day theatre festival, being organised in Dhaka by the Centre for Asian Theatre, Dhaka National Theatre and Centre for Ibsen Studies, to be held from November 13 to 24, may point at a few answers.         
	The focus is on Asian and Arab versions of Ibsen to see how the source text has changed according to the social and political perspectives in the new age, says Nilu Kamaluddin of the Centre for Asian Theatre, who teaches in Oslo.         
	Of the 22 performances to be staged three will be commissioned plays from the Delhi Ibsen Festival  Little Eyolf directed by Neelam Mansingh, Ratan Thiyams Ashibagee Eshei (based on When We Dead Awaken) and Anuradha Kapurs John Gabriel Borkman. From Calcutta there will be Norar Chithi, though its director Abanti is set to launch yet another Ibsen production, Hedda Gabler, adapted by her as Ranjabati Sen. The play will be staged by her group Aarshi on September 15, Gyan Manch.         
	The Dhaka festival will have A Dolls House from Pakistan and Peer Gynt from Nepal. Theatre groups from Bangladesh will stage 16 versions of Ibsens plays in modern and traditional theatre forms and there will be two collage performances using dance and video projections called Encounter and Communicator, said Kamaluddin. Theatre personalities from Egypt, Iran, Syria, Turkey, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh will talk about religion and freedom.         
	A similar seminar cum festival is slated for Calcutta in November 2010. We will soon be looking out for productions to commission, Kamaluddin added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | City left high and wet
                                                                                                               City left high and wet
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Commuters had a harrowing time on Monday as the storm crippled the citys transport system, both underground and on the surface.        
	Metro Railway services were suspended for around 15 minutes and the trains ran on truncated routes for more than three hours as uprooted trees blocked tracks at the terminal stations.        
	The services were first hit at 12.28pm when an uprooted tree blocked the tracks between Tollygunge and Rabindra Sarobar. In the next 45 minutes, three more trees fell on the tracks.        
	The services between Tollygunge and Maidan was suspended at 12.53pm, with the trains shuttling between Maidan and Dum Dum. The branches and trunks were removed at 1.30pm, but before that, at 1.14pm, an uprooted tree blocked the tracks between Dum Dum and Belgachhia. Two more trees fell in quick succession.        
	Between 1.15pm and 1.30pm, the services remained suspended on the entire stretch. From 1.30pm, the trains ran between Tollygunge and Girish Park. Normal service was restored at 3.45pm, said a Metro official.        
	Sources, however, said lesser number of trains rolled out compared with other weekdays because of shortage of personnel. Several drivers and other employees failed to turn up because of the weather, said a source. The process of clearing the tracks, too, was delayed.        
	The authorities, however, denied any delay.        
	The situation was no better on the surface. Only 25 per cent of the private buses hit the road and quite a few of them were withdrawn as the weather worsened. Many of our buses were damaged as trees fell on them, said Swarnakamal Saha, of the Bengal Bus Syndicate. Taxis, too, were few and far between.        
	There was no auto or bus when I left home for office at 11.30am. I waited for around 20 minutes before deciding to walk to Tollygunge Metro station, said Anindya Chakraborty, a resident of Naktala.         
	In the north, groups of people could be seen at all crossings of CR Avenue, frantically waving at vehicles for a lift. Taking advantage of the situation, the few taxis that were on the road tried to make a killing. A taxi driver asked for Rs 300 to take me to Sealdah from BBD Bag. When I approached a sergeant, he pleaded helplessness, said Ayan Mukherjee, an employee of Tea Board.

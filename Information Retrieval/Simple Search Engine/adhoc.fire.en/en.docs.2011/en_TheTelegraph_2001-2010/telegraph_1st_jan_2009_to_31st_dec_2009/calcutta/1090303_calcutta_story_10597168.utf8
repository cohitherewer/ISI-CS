The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hunt for greens to hone golf talent
                                                                                                               Hunt for greens to hone golf talent
          SUBHRO SAHA                          Indrajit Bhalotia, the lead coach in the IGU excellence programme, explains a point to youngsters at the RCGC. Picture by Santosh Ghosh                                  
	The Indian Golf Union (IGU), born in the cradle of the Royal Calcutta Golf Club in 1954, is teeing off a Focus East programme designed to catapult the city back to pole position in Indian golf.        
	We are looking at a golf academy and a driving range to complement and feed the junior programmes running concurrently in Calcutta, Ashit Luthra, who recently took over as IGU president, told Metro.        
	A plot of six to 10 acres is required to set up the composite facility, and Indian golfs parent body will soon approach the state government for the plot. Luthra, past captain of the Royal, felt there should be at least one driving range in every state capital in the East and the Northeast.        
	Our target is total domination of Asian golf, not just throwing up an SSP (Chowrasia) or an (Arjun) Atwal once in a while. Besides, SSP made it despite the system, not because of it. We want to remedy that, Luthra said.        
	To put together an efficient, champion-churning system, the academy is the first step, the new IGU boss pointed out. Efforts are also on to locate defunct courses in old industrial or town campuses which could be revived and reused.        
	For instance, we have identified an old golf course on the campus of Angus Jute Mills in Howrah, which could be brought back to a usable condition, added Hironmoy Chatterjee, the secretary of the West Bengal Golf Association, working in tandem with the IGU on the Focus East programme.        
	The IGU has tied up with Elmwood College in the UK for a green-keepers learning programme, with assistance from the Royal amp; Ancient Golf Club in Scotland, to create a ready resource pool for tending to new greens.        
	The golf body is also planning to go to the city schools with a fun golf programme, and identify talent for its proposed academy.         
	The underlying principles for initiation drills should be fun, safety and participation, according to Dominic Wall, the tournament director of Asia-Pacific Golf Confederation, who will reshape the IGUs junior programme.        
	The way forward for Indian golf is to increase the base of the pyramid, felt Luthra. Ideally, by 2010, we need to have at least 100 youngsters who can regularly break par, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Protest peters out at Presidency
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Protest peters out at Presidency
  - Teachers for unitary over affiliating        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	The CPM-controlled teachers lobbys protest movement to stop the government from conferring unitary university status on Presidency College appears to have crashlanded with a section distancing itself from the agitation at the 192-year-old institution.        
	Though the Government College Teachers Association had managed to sign up 60 teachers  out of around 150 in the college  from departments like physiology, physics, history, botany and philosophy in less than 24 hours, sources told Metro that a majority of Presidency teachers had decided not to participate in the protests.        
	The teachers of the physiology and physics departments have written a note to Shyamal Basak, the association general secretary, on Wednesday, stating that they do not want to remain signatories to the campaign. The signatories from the remaining departments also withdrew their signatures individually during the day, said the source.         
	The sudden withdrawal of the Presidency teachers  around 55 have apparently withdrawn their signatures  would weaken the associations plan to stall unitary university status for Presidency and demand affiliating university status, sources said.        
	The association has demanded that all 36 government colleges in the state should become affiliates of Presidency to benefit from its education system.         
	While drawing up its protest plan, the association wanted to use the Presidency teachers opposition to the unitary university status as a trump card.        
	Basak, who is also a teacher in Presidency College, admitted having received a letter from the teachers in the physiology department but refused to comment on the contents. I have no information about any backtracking by the Presidency teachers, he said.        
	But by Wednesday evening, the College Street campus was abuzz with the news of cracks in the camp and a senior teacher of the college told Metro that most teachers would prefer a unitary university status for the institution.         
	An affiliating university status will not help our college achieve academic excellence. We want a unitary university status, said a Presidency College teacher.        
	According to him, the association leaders had misled them by claiming that the objective of the movement was to press for Presidencys upgrade. Some teachers, who were initially with the association, could have changed their minds after realising the potential benefits from the unitary university status, added the teacher.         
	It seems that the Presidency College teachers have come to know that they would benefit more if the college gets unitary university status. The other reason may be a realisation that the exercise would be futile as the chief minister is driving the upgrade process, said a source in the education department.        
	Earlier this week, higher education minister Sudarshan Ray Chaudhuri had claimed that the party had given its seal of approval to the unitary university decision. Ray Chaudhury, who is now in North Bengal, reiterated the governments stand while inaugurating a college in Balurghat and ruled out any possibility of bowing down to the associations pressure.        
	It is not possible to consider affiliating university status for Presidency The government will soon place the new Presidency University Bill 2009 to give unitary university status to Presidency College, said the minister.        
	The bill is likely to be placed in the Assembly on December 16, a source in the education department told Metro.        
	The government is determined to get it passed in the Assembly, said the source.

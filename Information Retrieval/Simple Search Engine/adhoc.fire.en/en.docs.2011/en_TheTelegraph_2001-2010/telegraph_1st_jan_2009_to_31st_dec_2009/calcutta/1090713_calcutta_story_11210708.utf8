                                                                                                               MJ soars on sites, off the racks 
          KARO CHRISTINE KUMAR                          The demand for all things MJ has gone up since the death of the pop icon on June 25                                  
	Online or off the racks, everyone wants a piece of MJ. Along with surging sales of Michael Jackson CDs and VCDs at music stores across town, the number of virtual search hits for the pop icon has soared to a new high.        
	Bengal ranks sixth in the list of top 10 Indian states with maximum searches for Michael Jackson in the last 30 days on Google.        
	Bengal is among the states where people (with Calcuttans accounting for the majority) are most interested in information on Michael Jackson, said a spokesperson for the search engine.        
	Kerala, Karnataka, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh were the five states with the most traffic.        
	Google Trends, an analysis tool allowing users to view search patterns, witnessed a vertical graph on June 25 for clicks on the music icon. Since June 25, we have been witnessing a flood of queries related to Michael Jackson. The graph indicates that as soon as news of Michael Jacksons death spread, people in India started turning to Google for more information. Between June 26 and 28, people have been searching for Michael Jacksons death, his songs and videos, added the Google spokesperson.        
	According to Google Hot Trends, among the most searched for terms, worldwide, were Michael Jackson Memorial Booklet on July 7 and Michael Jackson Live Memorial Coverage on July 8.        
	In stores, Michael Jackson CDs and VCDs continue to fly off the racks. The stocks in the stores were sold out in two days after Jackson died. We then supplied 700-800 CDs and VCDs from our production unit in Mumbai. Now orders for almost 4,000 pieces have been placed from Calcutta, reveals a sales executive from Sony Music Entertainment India Pvt Ltd, which supplies to Music World, Planet M and Starmark.        
	Sales have increased five to seven times, and its still going strong, says Chetan Arora, the business head (east) of Music World. At the Music World on Park Street, a special rack with the pop icons collection has been set up in the front portion of the store.        
	People of all age groups are coming to buy his songs and videos. We sold everything we had and stocks ran out a day before his funeral. Fresh stocks have arrived but they too will sell out soon, revealed a salesperson.        
	Music sales have really shot through the roof. Its a significant increase, at least 50 per cent. Also, we are selling 15-20 copies of his biography instead of only one or two copies that we would sell earlier, said Gautam Jatia of Starmark.        
	Anything MJ seems to be in demand. Apart from his video CDs amp; DVDs, we are even getting queries for MJ posters, mostly from youngsters, says a spokesperson for Oxford Bookstore.

                      Heal the world                    A project by eminent British photographer, author and environmental campaigner Mark Edwards, Hard Rain is a photography exhibition interpreting Bob Dylans prophetic song A Hard Rains A-Gonna Fall. The exhibition showcases exclusive pictures taken and compiled from around the globe by Edwards, to bring alive our global problems and show how they are all connected by cause and effect. It highlights the issues defining the 21st century; poverty, habitat loss, human rights as linked to the pressing issue of climate change. A moving and unforgettable exploration of the state of our planet at this critical time, it shows that the world has little chance left to solve the problems related to poverty, waste of resources, habitat and species loss and, the summation of our problems, climate change, unless they are all tackled simultaneously. Launched at the Eden Project in Cornwall, UK in mid-2006, this exhibition drew public and critical acclaim, attracting the support and endorsement of political and environmental leaders across the world. It was exhibited at the UNO building in New York and also shown at outdoor locations in principal cities on every continent to over 12 million people. In India, the exhibition has already been held in Mumbai and will also be travelling to Bangalore. Hosted by British Council.

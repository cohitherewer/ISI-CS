The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Three wise men as career guides
                                                                                                               Three wise men as career guides
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Eduquest could make the transition from school to college easier for these HS girls                                   
	The examinations are over and the results are out, but the real test has only just begun.        
	Students anxious about making the right career choice can visit the Eduquest fair starting next weekend and have three wise men  Sabyasachi Mukherjee, Soumitra Chatterjee and Harsh Neotia  as their friends, philosophers and guides.        
	 Apart from a bouquet of career choices, we have lined up interactive sessions with three men who are qualified to tell the students what it takes to make it big, said a spokesperson for Eduquest, sponsored by the Camellia Group and organised by Careergraph (The Telegraph), Prostuti (Anandabazar Patrika) and Saraswati Online.com.        
	Bangalore-based management institute IFIM is the associate sponsor.        
	Actor Soumitra will interact with the students in the pressroom of Netaji Indoor Stadium from 4 to 5pm on June 6, designer Sabyasachi will speak to them on June 7 and industrialist Neotia will play mentor on the last day of the fair.        
	Students can also take a test designed to find out what career would suit them best. They will, of course, be counselled as well to make the right decision.        
	Over 100 national and international institutes  schools, colleges and universities  have confirmed their participation in the fair. The list includes Wuhan University of Technology in China, KLE University, Belgaum, Amity University, Mumbai Business School, Calcutta Institute of Management, Sikkim Manipal University, Lovely Institute, RICE and Ramakrishna Mission.        
	The army, too, will put up a stall at the exhibition for on-the-spot recruitment.        
	The focus of this years fair will be on unconventional career choices and emerging opportunities, an Eduquest official said.         
	So, along with old favourites like medicine, management, engineering and chartered accountancy, Eduquest will provide information on institutes offering job-oriented courses in advertising, animation, banking, bio-technology, fashion design, film technology, graphic design, hospitality amp; travel, insurance and interior design.        
	 Eduquest is a one-stop shop for all educational needs. It will be like a pre-counselling session for students before they sit for IIT and JEE counselling. The idea is to help them make informed choices, said Neelu Dutta, proprietor of the Camellia Group.        
	From students just out of school to graduates and post-graduates, there will be something for everyone.        
	Distance learning and part-time courses will also feature in the exhibition along with information on education loans and scholarships, an official said.        
	Experienced education counsellors and academics have been invited to preside over symposiums. The doors to the fair at Netaji Indoor Stadium will be open from 10am to 8pm on all three days.

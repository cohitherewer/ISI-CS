          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Peasant Abdul Hakim Mollah, a 28-year-old cancer patient with the rare Bombay (Oh) blood group has found two donors after his family had almost given up hope.        
	Abdul, a father of four, was unable to undergo surgery for treating his stomach cancer because of lack of blood donors. His plight was reported in Metro on April 21 (Cancer patient awaits blood for surgery).         
	On Tuesday morning, two people contacted us and donated blood. It was like magic, said Abduls brother Haque. The two donors were Pravat Chandra Behera, 53, of Howrah and Ajit Mukherjee, 40, of Baruipur. Ajits brother Asit will donate too, he said.        
	Deven Mahato District Hospital in Purulia has also given one unit of blood after its authorities read about Abdul. Others have called up to offer monetary help to the family, which had to sell off land to pay for Abduls treatment.         
	Donors can call 9836535815.

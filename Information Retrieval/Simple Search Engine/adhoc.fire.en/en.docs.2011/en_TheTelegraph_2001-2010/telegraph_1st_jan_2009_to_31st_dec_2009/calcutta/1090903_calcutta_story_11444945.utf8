The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Villa owners reach vexation point
                                                                                                               Villa owners reach vexation point

	Farmhouse owners at Vedic Village are in fear of finding themselves in no-mans land.        
	With no word from the resort management  the managing director is in prison and the rest are allegedly incommunicado  a cloud of confusion hangs heavy over the farmhouses.        
	We had bought property at Vedic Village in good faith. The farmhouse was not just an investment but a second home for me. Now that the vandalism has turned everything topsy-turvy, we should not be left to fend for ourselves, said the city-based owner of a farmhouse who requested anonymity.        
	The owner feels cheated for being kept in the dark about the nature of the property. We were never told that part of the land was vested... After all, ownership and holding a lease are not the same.        
	What seems to be worrying the owner the most was the uncertainty  perceived or real  surrounding the resort. What will happen now? The authorities should come clean, he said.        
	The growing sense of uncertainty over their investments  a villa costs anything between Rs 75 lakh and Rs 1.2 crore  is driving a section of owners to consider floating a platform to press for their rights.        
	We will fight for our rights. If nothing happens, we may consider forming an association of sorts, says Ajay Arya, an ENT surgeon at Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, who had bought a farmhouse after taking a loan from a nationalised bank.        
	Since the loan was from a nationalised bank, it was the governments duty to investigate the legality of the land.... Today the government is saying the land was forcibly acquired from farmers but what was it doing seven-eight years ago? If the situation worsens Vedic Village could be shut down and that would trigger a bigger problem, said Arya.        
	NRI and outstation owners are in constant touch with each other, sharing updates about the resort and legal proceedings against its promoters. I have been receiving mails and calls from outstation owners as well as those who live abroad. We have faith in R.K. Modi (the managing director of Vedic Realty who is now in judicial custody) but we are also concerned about the future, said Sandeep Shah, the lone resident at the resort.        
	Shah has recently received a letter from Modi who has assured him about the safety of the resort but like other buyers, he, too, is rankled by the fact that the promoters had kept him in the dark about many things.        
	Most of us purchased properties in Vedic Village believing what the management said. But the reports that are appearing have shaken our confidence, said Shah.

	Pantry manager held: Animesh Yadav, the 41-year-old pantry car manager of the Ernakulam-Guwahati Express on which more than 25 city students had fallen ill on Wednesday, was arrested late on Thursday for dereliction of duty. He was granted interim bail.        
	Maidan Book Fair: Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya described the Maidan as the ideal venue for the Book Fair at a programme organised at the upcoming book mall on College Street on Friday. The pollution caused by the Book Fair on the Maidan was manageable, he added.

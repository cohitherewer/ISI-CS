CESC has blamed the Calcutta Municipal Corporation for the fault in the underground cable that led to the disruption in power supply to Monojit Bararis house in Broad Street last week. The fault occurred while the civic body was digging up the road, said a CESC official. An official of the civic body, however, denied that the stretch had been dug up. We have not undertaken any work in that area, so there is no question of digging, he said.

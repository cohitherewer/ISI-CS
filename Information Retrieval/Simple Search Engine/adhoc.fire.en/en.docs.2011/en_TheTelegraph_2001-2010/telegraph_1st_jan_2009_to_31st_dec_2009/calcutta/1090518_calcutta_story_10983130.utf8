                                                                                                               NRI blood sample sent for test
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 33-year old researcher from Kentucky, US, has been admitted to a city hospital with fever and his blood sample is being tested for swine flu.        
	The man, who had arrived from Kentucky at Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi and travelled from there to Calcutta on May 10, has been quarantined at Infectious Diseases (ID) Hospital at Beleghata.        
	He went home to Midnapore where he complained of fever. As a precautionary measure, he was admitted to the Beleghata hospital on the night of May 15 and has been quarantined, a senior official of the state health department said on Sunday.        
	His blood sample has been sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune. The report is expected by Monday.         
	In all probability, it is not swine flu as the patient is not suffering from any symptom of the disease except fever, he said.

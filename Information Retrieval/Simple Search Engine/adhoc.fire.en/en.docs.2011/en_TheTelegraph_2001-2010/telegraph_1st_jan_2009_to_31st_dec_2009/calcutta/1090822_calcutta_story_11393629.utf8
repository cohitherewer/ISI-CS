The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Police meet tease victims
                                                                                                               Police meet tease victims
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Police on Friday visited Keshoram Cotton Mills High School and talked to some of the girls who were teased by three bike-borne youths on Tuesday morning.        
	The trio also shot at the driver of the pool car in which the girls were travelling when he protested their behaviour.        
	The girls said they had not seen the trio earlier. We recorded their statements, said an investigating officer.        
	Three days have passed since the incident but cops are still in the dark about the identity of the three youths. We have distributed their sketches to local residents but none has so far identified them, the officer added.        
	C.L. Singh, the headmaster of the Metiabruz school, expressed concern that the trio were still at large. Anxious parents are calling us everyday asking whether the youths have been arrested.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Wetland. Where?
                                                                                                               Wetland. Where?

	What to do on a cool winter morning? Go and say goodbye to the East Calcutta Wetlands.         
	Its 12,500 hectares of land and water. In many places its open, uninhabited and beautiful. And its just 15 minutes by road from Science City. If you havent been there already, go this weekend, and take the children. Chances are these wetlands will not be around by the time they become teenagers.         
	Acting on a proposal by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), Calcutta High Court has given conditional permission to a project that may well lead to the destruction of the vast expanse of green that we see along the Bypass now. The project calls for the setting up of a water treatment plant on the wetlands.         
	This despite the fact that since 1992, following a landmark judgment by the same court, the wetlands have been legally protected. The court had ruled that there should be no change in the prevailing land use and the state government should ensure that status quo is maintained.         
	That ruling came on a petition filed by PUBLIC (People United for Better Living in Calcutta) against a proposed World Trade Centre on the wetlands. This time, too, PUBLIC filed a petition to stop the water treatment plant.         
	The CMC argued that providing piped water to east Calcutta was essential and that it had no other land to set up such a plant. Not surprising, since alternative sites have been sold off at profitable prices.         
	But why do the east Calcutta wetlands matter?         
	The answer is simple  the wetlands are of overwhelming importance to Calcuttas ecological health. They help the city by reducing flooding and recharging its ground water, absorbing air pollution, enabling sewage disposal and waste recycling and providing a livelihood to 20,000 families engaged in fish and vegetable farming.        
	Because of its ecological and socio-economic importance, in 2003 the central government declared the East Calcutta Wetlands as Wetlands of International Importance under the Ramsar Convention. This gives the area the status of a protected zone under an international treaty to which India is a signatory.         
	Bending the law        
	The CMC argued in court that they were asking for a mere 20 acres. Also, the proposed area (opposite ITC Sonar Calcutta), while within the wetlands, was sort of on the boundary and would not do too much damage.         
	But the implications are frightening  not only for the wetlands but also for Calcutta as a city.         
	First, this judgment reflects a rejection of the precautionary principle, critical in environmental policy, compulsory in many legal systems and emphasised repeatedly by the Supreme Court. This principle, put simply, states that when there is risk of irreversible damage being done to the environment from a project, in the absence of scientific consensus, the burden of proof is on the advocate of the project that no harm shall result.         
	In this instance, the CMC provided no evidence of harm not resulting from construction and chemicals. The clear message is: in this part of the country, the precautionary principle is for the birds.         
	A second implication is that this project per se poses a real threat to the immediate surroundings and will completely change the nature of the area. The construction activity and the storage and use of chemicals (chlorine and alum) as well as the generation and disposal of sludge will be a management challenge. While the court has laid down conditions calling for minimum construction and use of eco-friendly materials, the technology of treating water does not allow for such conditions to be fulfilled.         
	Again, the court has appointed a three-member external committee to monitor and report to it whether the civic body is complying with these conditions. Whether such monitoring is feasible, whether reports will reflect the ground reality and whether the court will be prepared to stop or reverse the project in case of non-compliance are issues that may require a leap of faith.         
	Public interest        
	Finally, the fact that the 1992 order has been modified  ostensibly in public interest  means that many more projects will follow. Already, proposals are in the pipeline calling for construction of roads, setting up of power delivery facilities and large-scale construction of housing. Every department of the government, every real estate developer, every resort builder in the city  and outside  will now be packaging his project so that it is in the public interest.         
	After all, if five-star hotels and highrise complexes can qualify for this label, why not every other project?         
	Some of us will jump at these great investment opportunities; the rest of us will be mute spectators to Calcuttas greatest environmental asset being stripped away         
	Indeed, the wetlands are up for grabs. Which is why you should go there soon.

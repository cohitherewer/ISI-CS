                                                                                                               Bombs mark run-up to poll results 
          OUR BUREAU                              
	The run-up to counting on Saturday was marked by sporadic incidents of violence in the city and its suburbs.        
	In Madhyamgram, on the northern fringes, Trinamul Congress workers Debdulal Brahma, 27, and Khoka Das, 30, were injured on Thursday night after alleged CPM goons lobbed bombs at their homes. On Friday morning, Trinamul activists blocked Badu Road for an hour protesting police inaction.        
	According to Trinamul leaders, the goons also beat up Khoka Das. Two makeshift shops run by Trinamul activists in the area were allegedly razed too.        
	Local CPM leader Sanat Biswas denied the allegations and police said they were looking for those who had hurled the bombs.        
	Tension ran high in Jorabagan after Congress-Trinamul and CPM supporters engaged in a pitched battle. A large number of cops were deployed in the area but no one was arrested till Friday evening.        
	Allegations flew thick and fast as both camps accused each other of intimidation and violence. Ajay Saha, the CPM councillor of ward 21, said Trinamul supporters allegedly threatened some elderly CPM supporters living at 35 Darpanarayan Tagore Street on Thursday night.        
	On Friday morning, Trinamul and Congress supporters threw bombs at our supporters. They appeared trying to bring back the dark days of the 1970s, Saha said.        
	He said CPM supporter Satyandra Shaw suffered splinter injuries in his chest and had to be operated upon.         
	Congress and Trinamul supporters countered saying Darpanarayan Tagore Street was a CPM stronghold and the cadres were threatening the few Congress and Trinamul supporters living there.         
	Darpanarayan Tagore Street resident and Trinamul supporter Biswajit Singha alleged he was threatened at gunpoint and beaten up by the CPMs Raju Nag and Kaju Nag.        
	Congress and Trinamul supporters alleged that CPM cadres were trying to terrorise them as they had realised that their candidate Mohammad Salim would be defeated by Sudip Bandopadhyay. They also accused the police of discrimination.

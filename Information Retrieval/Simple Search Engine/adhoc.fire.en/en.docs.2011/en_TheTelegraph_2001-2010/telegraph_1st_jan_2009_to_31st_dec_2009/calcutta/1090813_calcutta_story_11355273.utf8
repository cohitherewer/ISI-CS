  - Durbar Square with Nepal aid          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          A fibre image of goddess Chandi to be used to decorate the pandal of Tridhara Sammilani. Picture by Sudeshna Banerjee                                        
	Durbar Square will host Goddess Durga this year, with a helping hand from the tourism department of Nepal. This will happen as part of Tridhara Sammilanis 63rd year of Puja off Rashbehari Avenue.        
	We have chosen Nepal as our theme this year to send out a message that the community is integral to Bengals culture and religious heritage at a time when there is so much unrest in Darjeeling, says councillor of Calcutta Municipal Corporations ward 85 Debashish Kumar who is general secretary of Tridhara Sammilani, which was crowned Model Puja in CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja 2008.         
	The puja committee has approached Nepals city consulate and consul-general Suresh Man Shrestha has promised to provide all help for creating a Nepali ambience at the puja. The help will come from Nepal Tourism Council and some private tourism outfits of Nepal.         
	Shrestha, who attended a curtain-raiser organised by the puja committee on Tuesday evening, told Metro: It is a unique concept and a great promotion of Nepal.        
	Theme-maker Dipak Ghosh has planned a four-headed Durga based on the Mother Goddess figure on the arched gate of the Taleju Bhabani temple inside Durbar Square in Bhaktapur. The other Bhaktapur inspiration is the Yaksheshwar Mahadev temple, for the exterior of the pandal. The temple is an illustration of Newari architecture and is rich in metal work and wood carving, says Ghosh.        
	A stall will be set up at the puja site to promote tourism and handicraft of Nepal. Cultural troupes will be brought in to perform on the three Puja nights. The consulate will also provide Gorkha guards. Efforts are on to arrange for a Nepali priest to perform puja alongside his Bengali counterpart.        
	There will be more of Nepal at the puja. A structure, replicating the wood carvings on the Kumari House of Kathmandu in thermocol, will house a Kalbhairava idol on the ground floor and Kumari figures upstairs.         
	Behind it will come up a replication of the Hiranyagarbha Golden Temple in Patan. We will plant seeds there on the day after Mahalaya. In keeping with Nepali tradition, a golden pitcher will be placed inside, around which weapons will be placed. This worship is called Gorkha puja, says Gargi Mukherjee, an organiser. And overlooking it all will be the figure of King Bhupatindra Malla, atop a column.

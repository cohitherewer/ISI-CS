The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Wanted: water amp; power
                                                                                                               Wanted: water amp; power
          ONTHESPOT - KASBA INDUSTRIAL ESTATE                          Entrance to the Kasba Industrial Estate Phase I. Pictures by Bishwarup Dutta                                  
	In an election year, when the ruling Left Front government is trying to turn its industry-friendly face into a major poll plank, the existing Kasba Industrial Estate in south Calcutta still lacks some of the most basic infrastructure. Frequent power cuts, inadequate water supply and bad road conditions are common complaints here.         
	We face shortage of water and electricity. Also despite repeated requests, there are no adequate fire fighting measures, said Anupam Baral, vice president of Kasba Industrial Entrepreneurs Association. The industrial estate started functioning in 1989 and has around 250 units operating in three phases. The chief minister once said that among all the industrial estates, the one in Kasba is running most successfully. Yet, the government does not provide some of the most basic facilities here, said Samrat Gupta, who owns Hindustan Controls, an electrical unit inside the estate. Located behind Ruby General Hospital, the estate houses factories of Monginis and GKB Opticals other than leather, electronics, pharmaceutical units.         
	Water woes        
	Inadequate water supply is a bane here. We pay water tax to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) every year. But the CMC hasnt installed any water pipeline inside the estate till date, said Baral. At present, three water pumps installed by the West Bengal Small Industries Development Corporation (WBSIDC) pump up underground water for the three phases. But this is not adequate for the 250 units operating here. Also the pumps frequently break down and it takes two to three days to get them repaired. Just imagine our plight during such times, added Baral. Moreover, the water that flows out of the taps is black and stinks. We fear that there is some leakage in the sewer lines and the water gets contaminated, said Supran Chowdhury, who owns a leather unit here.         
	Fire facts        
	Despite incidents of fire, unit owners allege that no fire engines are stationed inside the estate. Five months back, a leather unit caught fire and all its three floors were gutted. The fire minister visited the site and promised to look into our request for keeping a fire engine inside the estate. But nothing has happened so far, added Chowdhury.         
	Power pangs        
	Another basic requirement for any industrial estate, uninterrupted electricity, also remains elusive for the unit owners. Often, there are power cuts for two to three hours at a stretch. This hampers production, said Baral.                   Condition of a road in the estate

	A road that goes through Phase I and II is lying in a state of disrepair for a long time. The road hasnt been repaired ever since it was built in the mid 90s, said Gupta. If this road is repaired and made usable then vehicles coming to and leaving the estate can directly hit the bypass through the feeder road, he added. At present, all vehicles coming to the estate take the narrow main road going towards Anandapur. The CMDA road would ease the traffic on this Anandapur road that is used by buses, private vehicles of the several housing complexes in the area as also school buses. Also stretches of road inside the estate are in a deplorable condition. After the roads are dug, they are never repaired, said Gupta.         
	Ministerspeak: I will go for an inspection to Kasba Industrial Estate in a couple of months. But the fire service cannot afford to keep a fire engine stationed at the estate round the clock. The unit owners themselves must make adequate fire fighting measures, said the state fire and emergency services minister, Pratim Chatterjee.         
	Officialspeak: CMDA will soon repair the road. We have already made a cost estimate of the job. We want to hand over the maintenance of the roads inside the estate to the CMC, said Debdas Bhattacharya, director general, traffic and transport section of CMDA.         
	Yes we are aware of problems like bad road conditions and inadequate water supply. We have spoken to both the CMC and the CMDA and urged them to look into these problems. But these are not really affecting work there, said Moinul Hassan, chairman, WBSIDC.

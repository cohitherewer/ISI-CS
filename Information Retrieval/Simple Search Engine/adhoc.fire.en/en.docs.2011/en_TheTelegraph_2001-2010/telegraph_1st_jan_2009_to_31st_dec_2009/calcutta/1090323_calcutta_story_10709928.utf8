                Metro Railway ran trains from 11.30am, instead of 2pm, on a trial basis on Sunday. Officials said 15,424 passengers took the trains between 11.30am and 2pm. On an average, 12,500 passengers take Metro every hour on Sundays. The Metro authorities said the footfall in the first two-and-a-half-hours wasnt enough to make the trial timing permanent. Passengers alleged that few people were aware of early start to Metro services. The authorities will conduct another trial run from 11.30am next Sunday before deciding on making the timing permanent. According to passengers, the timing needs to be tried for a number of weeks before a decision is taken.    A 35-year-old motorcyclist died on Sunday morning after ramming into a divider on New Town Road on Saturday night.

Pockets in south Calcutta, including Kalighat and Behala, received civic water supply for an hour less than the stipulated time on Sunday morning. Water from Garden Reach water works was available in these areas for three hours from 6am. Power cuts led to the shortage in supply, said an engineer.    Cyclist Prafulla Ghosh was seriously injured after being hit by a taxi on Vivekananda Road late on Saturday. He was admitted to Medical College and Hospital for treatment. The taxi driver who hit him was arrested. Police said the driver was drunk.

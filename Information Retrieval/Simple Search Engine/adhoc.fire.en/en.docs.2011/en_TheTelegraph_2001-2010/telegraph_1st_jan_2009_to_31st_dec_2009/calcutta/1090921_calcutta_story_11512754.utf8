The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Entrance test for CU courses
                                                                                                               Entrance test for CU courses
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                The College Street campus of Calcutta University     Calcutta University will admit   students to all its postgraduate   courses through entrance   tests from the next academic   session.  The decision follows a rul  ing by the high court on Sep  tember 12 which implied that   the university must follow the   same set of rules for admitting   students from autonomous   colleges as well as affiliates.  Now, admission tests are   held in select courses such as   business management and   journalism.  Vice-chancellor Suranjan   Das said entrance tests wou-ld   ensure uniform admission cri  teria for all students.  The admission system   needs to be changed in view of   the decision to grant autono  my to affiliated colleges. We   must follow a uniform system   for admitting students from af  filiated colleges as well as au  tonomous institutions which   were once under the universi  tys fold. The uniformity can   be established only if students   are admitted through admis  sion tests, Das said.  The university will soon   start preparations for con  ducting next years tests to   admit students to around 6,000   seats in the postgraduate   courses in science, arts, com  merce, and engineering and   technology faculties.  Several thousand stu  dents will sit for the tests. I un  derstand my colleagues teach  ing postgraduate courses will   be inconvenienced as they will   have to examine the answer   scripts. It will be an extra work   load for them, the vice-chan  cellor said.  The authorities are yet to   decide whether the tests   would be centralised or each   department would conduct its   own examination.  We will definitely give   more autonomy to the depart  ments if they conduct the tests   independently, said a univer  sity official.  The high court ruling fol  lowed a petition by 10 St   Xaviers College students who   alleged that they were denied   admission to postgraduate   courses because of the univer  sitys discriminatory admis  sion criteria for students from   autonomous colleges. St   Xaviers was the first CU affili  ate to be granted autonomy.  The university this year   admitted graduates from St   Xaviers based on normalisa  tion of their undergraduate   marks  a statistical method   aimed at achieving parity be  tween marks scored by stu  dents from the autonomous   colleges and the affiliates.  Students from the affiliat  ed colleges, save those who |  had applied for seats in depart  ments that conduct admission   tests, were admitted on the   basis of their undergraduate   marks

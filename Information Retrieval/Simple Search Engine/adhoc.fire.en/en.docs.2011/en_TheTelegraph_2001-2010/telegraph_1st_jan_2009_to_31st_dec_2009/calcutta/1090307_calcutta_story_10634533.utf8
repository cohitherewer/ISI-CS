The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | C beats A and B in date game
                                                                                                               C beats A and B in date game
          CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE                               
	Calcutta for once has outsmarted Ahmedabad and Bangalore at their own game.        
	To ensure first mover advantage to the batch of 2009, the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Calcutta sprang a surprise on other IIMs this year and advanced the final placement dates by a week.        
	We took a calculated risk and advanced the dates at the last minute to get the recruiters first on our campus and the strategy paid off, said an official at IIM Calcutta.        
	Traditionally, the IIMs in Ahmedabad, Bangalore and Calcutta decide on their placement rosters in consultation with each other to avoid clashing of dates.         
	Other IIMs have often stumped us by tinkering with placement dates, but this is the first time we have done something like this. The condition of the job market is really tight and we didnt want our students to suffer, he said, explaining the motive of the move.         
	After consultations, the placement cells at the three IIMs had initially decided that the recruiters caravan would first stop at Ahmedabad followed by Calcutta and then Bangalore. Accordingly, the final placement season was scheduled for the first week of March on the Joka campus.        
	But all schedules went haywire when IIM Bangalore suddenly advanced its dates. We generally dont react, but this time we retaliated and advanced the dates further, said another IIM Calcutta source.        
	So instead of the first week of March, final placement started on February 21 at Joka. To accommodate all the recruiters the placements were conducted in two phases  February 21 to 24 and March 2 to March 6.         
	A senior IIM Ahmedabad faculty member confirmed the sudden change in the placement schedule in the countrys top three B-schools.         
	We advanced the placements by four days because of the other IIMs But we were the last to change the schedule, he explained.        
	Though the three premier B-schools are under the ministry of human resource development and enjoy almost the same status in terms of government grants and aid, the rivalry among A, B and C is obvious.        
	The intensity of competition peaks during the placement season as salary levels offered to the students play an important part in ranking of institutions, said an IIM Calcutta faculty member.         
	So, did the date trick pay rich dividends for Joka? The official communication on placement results will be out in a day or two, but the authorities are satisfied as some students have crossed the coveted crore-plus compensation mark despite the downturn.        
	The average salary levels are down by 15 to 20 per cent and the plush international postings are far fewer. But we are happy as we have been able to place all 265 students, which some of the other institutes are struggling to do, said a source in the placement cell.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Heart-stopper on bridge
                                                                                                               Heart-stopper on bridge
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The bus that lost control, rammed into a railing and then toppled over on Howrah bridge. (Gopal Senapati)                                  
	A speeding private bus running on retreaded tyres lost control and rammed into a railing on Howrah bridge, leaving seven persons injured.        
	Among the victims of the Tuesday morning mishap were the driver and one of the conductors of the bus on route 215A, which was travelling to Howrah station from Salt Lake.         
	Police took the injured to Howrah District Hospital, where the condition of two passengers was stated to be critical. They have suffered multiple injuries. The other five were released after first-aid, said a source in the hospital.        
	Pradip Sengupta, a passenger, said the bus started speeding as soon as it hit the bridge around 5am. The driver did not slow down even when he neared the other end of the bridge and lost control while trying to veer left. The bus rammed into the railing, which collapsed under the impact, and mounted the pavement. For a moment I thought the bus would topple over and fall into the river, recalled Sengupta, who suffered cuts on his legs.        
	The bus has been impounded and a probe is on to find out what led to the mishap. The front tyres of the bus, which had come off under the impact of the crash, were retreaded and did not have any grip, said an officer of Howrah police station.        
	Asked about rash driving on Howrah bridge, an officer admitted that drivers tend to speed before traffic hours start at 6am.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Colour burst in video art
                                                                            Sunday , November 8 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Colour burst in video art
										      eyewitness                            Ranbir Kaleka rsquo;s video at Birla Academy; (below) a painting by Jagannath Panda. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                           
	An exciting exhibition of the works of artists always in the news, mostly based in Delhi and Mumbai, has opened at the Birla Academy of Art amp; Culture. Curated by the young Deeksha Nath it demonstrates how Indian artists are using tech with as much panache as they wielded the brush or the chisel.         
	Astonishment of Being is an exhibition that demands introspection on the part of the viewer and a longish attention span as well. In that respect, it is quite unlike most of the hurriedly-put-together exhibitions that one is used to seeing in this institution.        
	As in many curated exhibitions today, this particular one is built around ideas of identity and nationhood. It begins with the fascinating four-channel video of Ranbir Kaleka titled Not from Here in which the humdrum realities of middle and lower middle class life in India take on the illusory quality of a mirage resolving in a brilliant burst of colours. There are some other videos as well conceived on a more modest scale which are equally compelling.         
	Mechanised magnifying glasses scrutinise various sections of Susanta Mandals photographs of a sack, capturing details of weave and the play of light and shadows. These stills lead to the monitor on which this video of a sack inside a cage is being shown. It leaves viewers wondering if the heaving sack is only a trick of vision.         
	Rags Media Collective has installed five monitors on the walls, each showing an image pertaining to the medias presentation of news and the manipulation of reality. This may be a commonplace enough idea, but the concept of murder mystery makes it interesting. The arrangement of monitors on the wall turns them into installations. In Vibha Galhotras take on identity, tiny silhouettes keep metamorphosing with a shake of the mouse. Prayas Abhinavs documentary style is all about alternatives. Tushar Joags Three Bullets for Gandhi looks theatrical beside these.        
	Painting and photography, too, are well represented in this large exhibition on three floors. Mithu Sens slashed palm is a stark yet enticing image, on the opposite pole of Jagannath Pandas lush image of smashed cars sprouting innards covered with exotic silks and a bounty of fruit seen in classical paintings.              
	Akar Prakars tribute to Paritosh Sen is an exhibition of the deceased artists self-portraits along with his post-mortem portraits by various colleagues. Sen did not hesitate to depict himself as a clown, but with the exception of Samir Roy, who turns him into a character out of a comic who loved his drink, most of the contributors seem to be in a respectful mood. Krishen Khanna turns him into a wise turtle, Jogen Chowdhury gives him a leonine head, and Veena Bhargava a Noh mask-like visage. He has craggy features in Sunil Dass bronze. Ganesh Halois pencil sketch was achieved after several trials. Everytime Haloi gave it a try they would look like Sens self-portraits.              
	Tapan Kanti Mitras watercolour landscapes at K2 are skilfully executed. A windblown tree, a shaft of light, boats and monsoon clouds and everything else one associates with this medium is on show here.               
	Rows of terracotta Bankura horses painted Wedgwood blue and arranged before a screen showing the Victoria Memorial hall constitute Kiran Chandras installation at Ganges Art gallery. In another installation, apparently harmless words that are potentially offensive are displayed. Thereby hangs an exhibition.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Killer truck torched
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Killer truck torched
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A truck that mowed down a pedestrian near Regent cinema in Chitpur was set ablaze on Friday afternoon, holding up traffic on BT Road for about two hours.         
	As the burning truck (WB 11A 8886) stood near Tallah Bridge on BT Road, vehicles were stranded on both flanks of the stretch. Police restored normality around 3.30pm, two hours after Kanailal Jaiswara, a small-time musician, was crushed under the trucks wheels.         
	Three fire tenders doused the flames and the truck was towed away, said an officer.        
	Local residents alleged the truck driver was inebriated.         
	The driver was drunk and speeding. After a mob set the truck on fire, the driver drove off with the flaming vehicle towards Chitpur Bridge, said Jiauddin Ansari, a witness.        
	When the trucks cargo of papers, rubber shoes and cartons caught fire, the driver abandoned the vehicle near the southern end of Tallah Bridge and fled. A mob caught the help and handed him over to the police.        
	Residents said rash driving was common on the stretch as cops take bribes from drivers.

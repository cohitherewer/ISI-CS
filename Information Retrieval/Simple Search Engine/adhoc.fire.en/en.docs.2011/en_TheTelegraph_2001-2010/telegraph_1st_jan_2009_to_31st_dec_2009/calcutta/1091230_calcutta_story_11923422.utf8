The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Terrace, the place to party
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Terrace, the place to party

	Wheres the party tonight? Right atop your house.        
	With Calcuttans keen to make the most of a rare chill, the terrace is a favoured party spot this season.        
	Its much more fun as you get to enjoy the Calcutta winter, explains Somini Sen Dua, a public relations consultant who had invitations to two terrace parties for Christmas Eve and Christmas. The number of terrace parties has gone up and they have become more chic, not amateurish affairs.        
	Chic they sure are. Most come with DJs, special lights and a menu designed for an outdoor party.        
	A nice terrace is a prerequisite. We live on the fifth floor and the terrace is right above, so it is very convenient. Also the pipes are camouflaged, almost like it was designed for a party. So once we have put up some nice lights, it makes for a lovely party place, says Brandon De Souza. The Gurusaday Road terrace parties of the ex-golfer whose company TSM drives the pro golf tour in India have live food counters and a well-stocked bar.        
	Ambience plays an important role in a terrace party. We set up a bar in the open and the menu is grill-based, says Captain Shoukat Mukherjee, a Ballygunge resident. A terrace party completely changes the mood. And this is the only time of the year when you can do it.        
	With the Celsius sliding to record December lows, the likes of Tulika Sinha have a reason to smile. The Deshapriya Park resident hosted her first terrace party on New Years Eve 10 years ago. Today it has become a regular affair.        
	Our terrace was built to host parties. We have a huge gang of family and friends, so it gets really difficult to hang out together, says Sinha. One of our friends acts as the DJ and my husband Sanjays company manufactures special lights that are used at nightclubs and parties, so we are able to create a well-decorated ambience.        
	A terrace party means you can spend the winter weekends with your kind of people, music and munch. Open door for kids is another plus. The youngest guest we have had at our terrace party is a two-month-old baby. Our party has become so popular that others among our friends have also started organising terrace parties, laughs Sinha.        
	So why is Calcutta waking up to more and more terrace parties this winter? Some attribute it to Calcuttans travelling more and picking up trends. Terrace parties are a rage in Pune and Bangalore, where the weather allows them to party in the open through the year. In Calcutta, we can do it only for a few weeks in winter, says Ranajit Mukherjee, a Salt Lake resident and a terrace party regular.        
	Others put it down to the call of the outdoors as a welcome break from the routine. How many people get time to relax in a garden or a terrace these days? So whatever little time one gets to party, an open space in winter is most welcome, says mixologist Irfan, who feels the terrace party trend is truly catching on.        
	Southern Avenue, with its highrises and terraces with a view of the Lakes is one hotspot. Since the party season began, every Saturday has seen a terrace party in the area, complete with proper music, lights and open-air grills. I have never seen so many terrace parties in one season, says Sameera Lahiri, a resident.

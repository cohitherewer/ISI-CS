The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | An election without wall grab
                                                                                                               An election without wall grab

	A little town called Tupelo in north-east Mississippi is heading for its municipal election but its walls arent showing it. Thats because the campaigners have found a whole lot of ways of reaching out to voters other than by defacing their walls.        
	The most common propaganda tool appears to be yard signs. These are flex signs displaying a candidates name and the position he is running for. About two feet wide and a foot high, the signs are found stuck into the ground in the front yards of houses where they enjoy high visibility.         
	But one cannot go around sticking in yard signs wherever one wants as the graffiti gangs do in Calcutta.        
	Says Wayne Seoville, who is campaigning for mayoral candidate Jack Reed Jr: We go knock at a door, take a step back and when the owner comes out, we speak to him about our partys programmes. If we find him to be a definite supporter, we politely ask if we might leave a yard sign on his ground. The answer is yes 50 per cent of the time.        
	Which means the other 50 per cent of the houses are left alone.        
	There are strict rules guiding the use and display of yard signs. Candidates have to obtain a permit before posting the signs. Also they can be displayed no more than 90 days before an election and no more than five days after the polls.        
	They stick to that most of the time. If they dont, the city can take the candidate to court and slap a fine, says Raymond Jordan, the vice-president of the Tupelo Home-Owners Association.        
	Other popular modes of campaigning are 30-second radio spots where a candidate speaks about himself and his plans for the city. Billboards are put up at important locations and advertisements are booked in the local community newspapers. Metro also spotted stacks of push cards at the receptions of popular restaurants.         
	Some people came in and asked if we minded keeping a bunch of push cards. We didnt. So there they are. Customers sometimes pick up one on their way out, said the usher at Ronnies.         
	One such push card for Republican Perry Smith, who is the running councilman for ward 6 of Tupelo, had his picture, the slogan Bring Perry back and a single-line appeal  Your Vote amp; Support Appreciated.        
	On the overleaf was Perrys background, his poll promises and a signed commitment to the cause of Mississippi. It even included his phone number and a line that he had paid for the card. This implies the candidate approves of what has been written on the card, said a local political watcher.        
	So would Tupelo allow candidates to paint wall graffiti? Candidate Perry Smith said: If anyone ever tried, people would surely be outraged.         
	Tupelo is a picturesque town with a lot of green and people take pride in their villa-like homes.         
	If someone were to deface my walls I would take him to court. In fact I might chase him down myself and hand him soap and brush to clean it up, said a Doug Foster, a resident.        
	That is something party cadres do in Calcutta when they are forced to, leaving whitewash marks that are worse than poll graffiti.

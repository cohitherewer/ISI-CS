The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A lament for the little car
                                                                                                               Caleidoscope      A lament for the little car
										                        The Maruti 800				                           
	Is Maruti Suzuki in its 25th year going to retire the first car it rolled out, the tiny, friendly and cute Maruti 800?         
	It seems the company might. As Bharat Stage IV environment norms come into place in 2010, Maruti 800 is likely to be phased out from 11 metros unless its manufacturer thinks it is cost-effective to upgrade it.        
	So as the Nano rolls into town, the M800 will probably be saying Ta ta. To the collective sigh of 27lakh owners of the 800.         
	It is very special for its owners in Calcutta. Some of them are already lamenting.         
	The potholes of Kona Expressway, the clutch-and-brake drives through Jawaharlal Nehru Road, the skilful negotiation of the completely dug-up Behala bylanes, the tram tracks on Harrison Road, the narrow meandering lanes of Kalighat, the traffic snafu at Park Circus  no car other than the 800 is suited for these, they say.         
	Calcutta roads need more of the 800 than any space-hugging, petrol-guzzling monster. A most basic car, with proven suspension and road handling, 800 has been most reliable in Calcutta.         
	With its engine placed at a suitable height, the 800 wades through Calcuttas waterlogged streets with the practised ease of a seasoned swimmer.         
	Where many feel finding God is easier than finding a parking slot, 800 fits snugly into the tightest of places. With even the roadside mechanic familiar with its workings, any breakdown is taken care of easily at any remote corner of the city.        
	Calcutta will miss Maruti 800 sorely if it is driven away.         
	Serials over Gods        
	A five-year-old was taking music lessons, which perhaps was a tad difficult for him. The teacher said: You are playing the harmonium all wrong. Cant you hear? Should I call you Kanai? (Kanai is another name for Lord Krishna, but kaan is Bengali for ear.)         
	To which the boy solemnly replied: I know Kanai. I also know Durga. Everyone thought the child knew his gods. Till he added: And I also know Rupam. It made his audience realise that he was not talking about the pantheon of Hindu gods and goddesses, but about the characters of a Bengali serial he watches, Durga.         
	Durga and Rupam are the lead characters while Kanai is the servant who takes care of Rupam, who is differently abled. None of them is a god, at least not technically, though Durga seems endowed with supernatural powers now and then. Talk about spiritual education!

	A domestic help and her accomplice were arrested on Thursday for theft at the Alipore residence of Italian trade commissioner Vittorio Mecozzi on December 2.         
	Police said the help, Arick Mary, 34, was a resident of Ekbalpore, and her aide, Mullick Kumar, 20, lived in her locality. An officer said Mary told the cops that she needed money for Christmas shopping.        
	Mecozzi and his wife Camilita had left for Delhi on November 25. The keys of the third-floor flat were with Mary, who stole a digital camera, some euros and Rs 1,200, said city detective chief Damayanti Sen.        
	Camilita returned to the city on Wednesday after Mary told her about the burglary. The police visited the five-storey building on Raja Santosh Road on Thursday and found the doors and windows of the flat intact.         
	CCTV footage revealed Mary had entered the building with a youth a few days back. She confessed to the crime during interrogation, said Mohammed Kalimuddin, the officer-in-charge of Alipore police station.         
	Kumar told us Mary had sold the camera to a local youth, Suraj Rajbanshi, for Rs 3,000. We nabbed Suraj and seized the camera, said the officer. The trio were remanded in judicial custody.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Calcutta youths show high designs
                                                                                                               Calcutta youths show high designs
  - City sends most number of entries for budding-talent showcase at fashion week           SMITA ROY CHOWDHURY                          A model in a Paromita Banerjee creation                                        
	Calcuttas GeNext has designs on the national fashion crown.         
	The city has again topped the list of entries for the Emerging Designer category of a national fashion week, building on a trend that started some seasons ago.         
	Twelve of the 44 applicants from 22 cities in the Emerging Designer section of the Lakme Fashion Week (Spring-Summer 2010)  slated for September 18-22 in Mumbai  are from Calcutta.         
	While only one of them  Paromita Banerjee  has made the cut along with two other applicants from elsewhere, industry veterans cant stop gushing about the quality of the Calcutta crop. Season after season we have been receiving an overwhelming number of applications from young designers of Calcutta. When we speak about originality and creativity, it is directionally coming from there, said Anil Chopra, adviser, Lakme.         
	Paromita, who showcased her creations in the GeNext category at the fashion week (fall-winter 2009-10 season) in March, is ecstatic at being chosen again.         
	LFW kick-started my career in a brilliant way. I was able to show my collection to a national audience, and it was received very well. I bagged lots of orders at the March show, which I am servicing till now. For the next show, my expectations are a couple of notches higher than the last time, the 26-year-old Lansdowne girl told Metro.         
	In the GeNext category for the coming show, the number of applications from Calcutta is 15, not counting one from Serampore. The city is second only to Delhi, which accounts for 27 of the 81 applicants.         
	At the March edition of LFW, five of the eight designers showcased in the GeNext category were from Calcutta. In the Emerging Designer category, the city had topped the list of applications with 13 out of 36, followed by Delhi with five.                           
	Designer Wendell Rodricks, a member of the LFW advisory board, said: For some years now the nation has noticed the talent of Calcutta designers. At GeNext we have a large percentage of designers from Calcutta. It is a growing trend and Calcutta should be proud of it. Kolkata Fashion Week was testimony to the growing presence of Calcutta designers.         
	So what sets the young Calcutta designer apart? Originality of design, according to experts.         
	When we select a candidate we dont look at the city, we just go by the quality of work. In the end we are surprised that we end up selecting so many from Calcutta. What makes their work special is that they are not trying to emulate anybody. They are very original in their design sensibilities and that speaks through their work, said Chopra.         
	Wendell is confident the Calcutta connection will get stronger over the next few fashion weeks. Calcutta has the talent to displace the other fashion metros. In a short time it has overtaken Bangalore and, in my opinion, now ranks third after Mumbai and Delhi.

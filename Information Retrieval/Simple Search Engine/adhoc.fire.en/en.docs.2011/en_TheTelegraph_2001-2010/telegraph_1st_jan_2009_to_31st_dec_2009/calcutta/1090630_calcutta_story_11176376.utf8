                      Colours of the season                    Featuring works by eight promising artists of the city, Tejas Art Gallerys Summer Show 09 is a true and faithful representative of the varied styles, techniques and trends prevalent in the contemporary art scene. The works on show are both a manifestation of the inner and outer self of the artists and of their experimentation with different medium and materials. While Ranjan Mukhopadhyays preoccupation with the human struggle for existence within and without finds expression in his stark charcoals and ink drawings reminiscent of Michelangelos figures, Bibek Pauls entangled living abodes are his depiction of our congested cityscape. In complete contrast, Arunava Mondals fascination with nature and the compelling urge to play with colour find expression in his bright, organic, surreal acrylics. Sanjay Kumar Samanta (a painting by him appears here) has evolved a unique style of creating dimensional textures in his landscapes that express the symbiotic relationship between man and nature. A spontaneous expression of nature and love is reflected in Atish Mukherjees works that draw stylistic inspiration from diverse Indian folk art forms. Avijit Mukherjees visual comments on contemporary life give old metaphors a whole new meaning. Tanay Kumar Pals abstract mixed-media works are characterised by meticulously cut, layered, paper-contours. Inspired by mythological scenes as well as flora and fauna, the art of Ayushman Mitra is an expression of his relationship with the world.                  Event: An exhibition of paintings by a group of young artists

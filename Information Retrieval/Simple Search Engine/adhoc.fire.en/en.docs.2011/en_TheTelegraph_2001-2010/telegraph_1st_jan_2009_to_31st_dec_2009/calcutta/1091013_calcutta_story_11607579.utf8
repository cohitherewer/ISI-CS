The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fireworks too few for fair
                                                                                                               Fireworks too few for fair
  - Opening delayed by a day           A STAFF REPORTER                          Police chief Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti inspects the Bazi Bazar grounds on Monday. (Sanat Kumar Sinha)                                        
	Police, fire brigade and the pollution control board on Monday gave permission for the inauguration of this years Bazi Bazar on the Shahid Minar grounds on Tuesday but the fair organisers refused to open shop citing lack of adequate fireworks.        
	The pollution control board and the police banned 41 of the 55 fireworks that were tested on Sunday, leaving us with only 14 kinds of fireworks to sell, said Sanjay Kumar Dutta, the secretary of the Burrabazar fireworks dealers association.         
	He said the association had requested the police to allow retesting of 28 fireworks that failed Sundays decibel test so that the traders could offer variety to customers and abide by the law. The fair would begin on Wednesday, he added.        
	If the association approaches us for retesting, we would co-operate, said police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti, who visited the fairground on Monday.        
	The organisers said the delayed opening would mean huge losses for the traders. We want a retest of the 28 firecrackers because they had passed the 90-decibel sound limit test last year, said Dutta. He added that the extra time would allow the fair organisers to plug the safety loopholes pointed out by the fire department on Monday.         
	We asked the organisers to leave a 30ft gap after every 75ft of stalls. Five stalls need to be relocated. We also asked them to remove naked wires from inside the stalls, said Gopal Bhattacharya, the director-general of fire services.        
	The fair, with 80 stalls, will be on from 10am to 10pm.         
	The police said on Monday that 14 people had been arrested for selling and transporting banned firecrackers and 4,000kg banned fireworks had been seized so far.

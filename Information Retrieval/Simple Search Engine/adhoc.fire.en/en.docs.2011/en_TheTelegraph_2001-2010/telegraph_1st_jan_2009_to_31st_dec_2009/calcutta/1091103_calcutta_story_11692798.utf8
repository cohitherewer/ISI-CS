										    Onthespot - Rickshaws                        Illegal rickshaws have proliferated in the city				                           
	Hand-pulled rickshaws, the most enduring icon of the city after Howrah bridge, are destined to remain on the road as the authorities dither over pulling the plug on them.              
	The state government, even after announcing a ban on hand-pulled rickshaws in 2005, has not taken any initiative to implement it.        
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) puts the number of hand-pulled rickshaws in Calcutta at 5,000. The traffic department of Calcutta police, however, said about 20,000 rickshaws ply in the city.        
	The number of members of the hand-pulled rickshaw union is 24,000. Unofficially, the number of rickshaws is said to be 40,000, with nearly a lakh pullers.         
	The lack of authentic data is preventing us from formulating a rehabilitation package, the first step to pulling out the rickshaws, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.        
	According to him, the CMC can rehabilitate only those who pull licensed rickshaws.        
	But the rickshaw unions are insisting that all the pullers in the city be rehabilitated, which the civic body says is financially not viable.        
	The policemen have been accused of allowing unlicensed rickshaws to proliferate.        
	The police are responsible for this. They take bribes and allow illegal rickshaws to ply in the city, said a civic licence officer.        
	This was corroborated by rickshaw pullers. We pay the policemen and they allow us to ply on the road, said rickshaw puller Zafar Ahmed, who does not have a licence.        
	Mayoral council member Dipankar De, who is looking into the matter, said: We are thinking of starting to renew the licences of registered rickshaws. It is a socio-economic issue, a question of livelihood of a large number of families.         
	A shop that makes hand-pulled rickshaws in south Calcutta continues to do good business despite the ban.        
	Proprietor Dhroba Shaw said: I am running this shop for 30 years now and the ban has not affected my business at all.         
	Most of the rickshaw pullers are migrants from Bihar. I came to Calcutta from Bihar in search of a job and started pulling rickshaws. After the ban, the police ask for more money, said Krishna Dev Yadav.        
	His passengers, he added, are mainly traders carrying goods, school students, senior citizens and tourists from abroad.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Consent hoax after horror
                                                                                                               Consent hoax after horror

	First deface the wall and then pen a pre-dated permission on behalf of the victim. That is the latest wall graffiti strategy of political foot soldiers waging war on our walls to drum up support for their generals.        
	Within hours of the The Telegraph highlighting three instances of violation of rules governing graffiti-writing on private walls in Tollygunge, CPM cadres launched Operation Consent to escape the Election Commissions rap.        
	The two-storeyed house on Pratapaditya Road where a widow had lamented how some Rabin Deb supporters had brushed aside her protests and painted the walls, was target number one.        
	The backlash she had feared while speaking to The Telegraph on Wednesday came in the form of a consent note, bearing the names of all four tenants in the building, that was submitted to Tollygunge police station.        
	The note submitted on Thursday afternoon was dated March 15. From the uniform handwriting it seemed that no signatures had been sought from the residents, police said. The cadres had merely put down the names of the tenants on the consent form and submitted it.            
	The wall graffiti had been painted six days ago, according to the widow whose ground-floor flat was locked on Thursday. The other residents were also not home on Thursday afternoon. Neighbours refused to comment for fear of a backlash from the supporters of South Calcuttas CPM candidate.        
	First they violated the model code of conduct and now they are submitting what looks like a bogus consent letter from residents. We have forwarded the letter to the returning officer mentioning the date and time of receiving it, said an officer of Tollygunge police station.        
	When we had visited the house on March 14, the widow had complained that the walls had been defaced without the residents permission. How come they submitted a consent letter dated March 15 with her name on it? The malpractice is obvious, he added.        
	Going by the model code of conduct, the CPM armys afterthought regarding a consent letter for wall graffiti should not shield it from the Election Commissions fire.        
	First, the consent has to be from the owner of the premises and not occupants or tenants. The letter of consent from the Pratapaditya Road address bears the names of the tenants and not the owners of the flats.        
	Second, the consent note has to reach the local police station or the returning officer either 72 hours before the wall is defaced or within 72 hours of the owners written consent being obtained. The vote for Rabin Deb graffiti came up on the Pratapaditya Road wall before March 14 and permission was not taken three days before that. The consent letter submitted on Thursday is dated March 15 and so it should have been submitted to the police station by March 18.        
	If the fear of the paintbrush brigade stalked Pratapaditya Road on Thursday, defiant voices began to be heard in other pockets of the Calcutta South constituency.        
	Tollygunge police station shot off four new cases of wall-graffiti violation by CPM cadres to the returning officer.         
	The loudest graffiti grumbles were heard from the four-storeyed Kalyani Apartment off Hazra Road, where a 7ftx8ft petition for Rabin Deb was plastered on the walls five days ago.        
	We didnt know when they defaced the wall. We would have never given them permission for that, said a member of the apartments association.        
	We did not dare to confront them but when the cops came calling we told them to take all necessary action against the violators. This cannot go on, he added.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Raj K. Modi, the managing director and chairman of Vedic Realty, has told police that his employees had kept him in the dark about the alleged coercive method of land acquisition for Vedic Village. He also claimed ignorance about stockpiling of arms on the resort premises.        
	Modi was grilled for over two hours on Monday at New Town police station by Siddinath Gupta, the deputy inspector-general of police (presidency range). Sleuths said they would scan land sale papers to verify whether the farmers were paid according to the prevailing market rate.

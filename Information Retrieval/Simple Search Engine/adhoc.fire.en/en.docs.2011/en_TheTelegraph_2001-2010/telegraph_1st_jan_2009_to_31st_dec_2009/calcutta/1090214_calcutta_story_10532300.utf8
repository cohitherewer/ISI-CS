The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | SIM found but trail cold
                                                                                                               SIM found but trail cold
  - Sleuths still groping for clues to Riz probe cops death          OUR BUREAU                                    
	A SIM card thought to be from Arindam Mannas missing cellphone was found on Friday but sleuths had little else in hand to take a call on whether he committed suicide or was murdered.        
	The CID said the numbers stored on the SIM card and the call details could hold decisive clues to the young railway police officers last hours.        
	Arindam, a GRP sub-inspector who briefly investigated the Rizwanur Rahman case, used to carry two cellphones. One of the phones was found beside his beheaded body near Mankundu station, in Hooghly, on Wednesday.        
	A CID team visited Arindams residence in Dasnagar, Howrah, with the call records of both his cellphones and asked family members whether they could identify any of the numbers he had dialled or received calls from. The sleuths returned with some documents, including Arindams bank details and documents pertaining to the house.        
	Arindam had called home thrice between 9.30pm on Tuesday and 1.40am on Wednesday, the first time to ask his parents to destroy all the papers related to their house. He had taken a loan for the single-storey building.        
	The sub-inspectors father, Ashok Manna, has filed an FIR accusing Ashok Todi, Rizwanurs father-in-law, and a section of GRP officers in Dum Dum of being responsible for his sons death. A lawyer representing the Todi family contested the allegation on Friday. This is nothing but a politically motivated move to malign my client, he said.        
	Sources said Arindam possibly died early on Wednesday after being hit by an express train. The body was lying on a rail track and the head was at least 20 feet away. It appears that he was hit by a speeding express train bound for Howrah. It was a foggy morning, which is why the train driver probably did not notice anything, an officer said.        
	Another reason for thinking that an express train hit Arindam is the state in which his body was found. An express trains fender goes lower than that of a local train and that could be the reason why Arindams head was severed on impact, the officer said.        
	A CID squad, led by inspector-general P. Nirajnayan, and forensics experts used a straw dummy to recreate what might have happened that day. A sniffer dog led the team to a mud track near Mankundu station, from where it headed for platform No. 1. The dog went close to a tea stall before the trail went cold.

          A STAFFF REPORTER                          Klaus-Dieter Lehmann, the Goethe-Institut president, near Vidyasagar Setu on Monday. (Sanat Kumar Sinha)                                  
	To celebrate 50 years of operations in India, Goethe-Institut/Max Mueller Bhavan are offering Rs 60-lakh production grants for proposals from all fields of culture showing a reference to Germany. There is a provision for grants for up to 10 projects, said Klaus-Dieter Lehmann, Goethe-Instituts president, on Monday before the beginning of a symposium organised jointly by the institute and Intach. Its theme was From old to gold: Making heritage work. The grant will have Indian jury members from all over the country.        
	 Lehmann also announced a German language programme for 500 schools all over the world, including 45 in India and four in Calcutta. Indian teachers will be trained in German language and high-performance students will be able to visit Germany. Many more schools are interested in joining the programme, said Lehmann. All the necessary equipment will be paid for by the institutes.        
	Both institutes will create infrastructure to allow Indian cultural institutions to use modern technology with more assurance. In Calcutta, since Western classical music is so much a part of the citys ethos, institutions like the Calcutta School of Music will be upgraded and teachers trained in methodology. Funding will vary from project to project, said Lehmann.        
	Moreover, a German Year in India will be celebrated from September 2011 to the summer of 2012. Max Mueller Bhavan will partner companies and science organisations to project a comprehensive and authentic picture of Germany, said Lehmann. It will provide a platform for discussion of things of interest to both sides. The Goethe-Institut and the foreign office will offer four million euros for the project, and German companies will offer a matching grant.        
	The seminar began with Andrea Hausmann, the professor of cultural management at Europe-University Viadrina Frankfurt (Oder), Germany and head of the masters programme: arts management and cultural tourism, saying stakeholders with varying interests and the USP of a destination have to be identified.        
	Saugata Roy, the Union minister of state for urban development, stressed that Calcuttas stately homes must be promoted as tourist destinations. He added that although the Centre had made a grant of Rs 21 crore for conservation of Dalhousie Square, the state government had not taken much initiative to use it.        
	Both Volker Hassemer, Berlins former senator for urban development and environmental protection and chair of the foundation Stiftung Zunkuft Berlin, and Lehmann stressed the need for public participation in the decision-making process while planning anything from a museum to heritage conservation.        
	G.M. Kapur of Intach said the West Bengal Tenancy Act is the bane of heritage conservation.        
	Rakhi Sarkar, the director of CIMA Gallery and managing trustee of the Kolkata Museum of Modern Art (KMOMA), said both Calcutta and Berlin had something in common. Berlin was destroyed after the 1945 tragedy and neglect is killing Calcuttas heritage. She felt KMOMA will turn Calcutta into a modern art hub.

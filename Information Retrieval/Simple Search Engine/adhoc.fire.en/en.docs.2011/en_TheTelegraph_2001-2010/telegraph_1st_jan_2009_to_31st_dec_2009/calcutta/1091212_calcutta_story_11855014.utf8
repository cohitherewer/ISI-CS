The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | The nine Ps of leadership
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                          The nine Ps of leadership

	Management guru Arindam Chaudhuri effortlessly tapped the pulse of the students present at National Librarys Bhasha Bhavan on December 9 during the Sanat Lahiri Memorial Lecture, organised by the Calcutta chapter of the Public Relations Society of India. In the city for the launch of his book, Discover the Diamond in You, Chaudhuri spoke on leadership and media.        
	On the role of the media in society, Chaudhuri said: The media in West Bengal is changing. Earlier, we could only hear the point of view of the ruling political party on the news channels. Now, we have a more balanced perspective, where the Opposition can air its point of view.        
	But when the media is not objective, it is the people who must distinguish between news and advertisement passing for information, he added.         
	Quoting from his book, he explained: To become a good leader, one must follow the nine Ps: passion, positive energy, performance, perseverance, personality, people skills, perspective, principles and patriotism. Just as the quality of a diamond is determined using the four Cs  carat, cut, colour and clarity  in the same way, a good leader can be identified using the nine Ps.         
	Chaudhuri also spoke up against the academic pressure faced by students. Today, young people are stressed by the demands of school and of parents. Knowledge is not acquired by cramming textbooks, but by keeping ones eyes and ears open, said the author of the bestseller Count Your Chickens Before They Hatch.        
	Principles are not moral science lessons learnt in the classroom, but the ability to distinguish between right and wrong, he stressed. He advised students that it was important to keep trying, even in the face of failure. How many knew Sylvester Stallone until he acted in Rocky? he asked, referring to the actors struggle.         
	He is a persuasive speaker, felt Javed Kazi, a public relations student at Bhavans Asutosh College of Communication and Management. I agree with him on the importance of perseverance, he added.

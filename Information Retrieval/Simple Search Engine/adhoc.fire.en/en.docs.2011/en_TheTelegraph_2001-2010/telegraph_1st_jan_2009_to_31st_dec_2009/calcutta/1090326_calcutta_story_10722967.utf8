The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Exam delay stumps students, schools
                                                                                                               Exam delay stumps students, schools
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Vivek Pai turned up at his school at 9.30 on the dot, hoping to catch up on some revision before sitting for the ICSE geography paper.        
	But he sensed something amiss when he saw a crowd of 100 parents at the gate of Don Bosco Park Circus arguing with the school authorities.        
	It was then that I came to know that the exam had been deferred till April 2 following a paper leak in Bangalore, said Vivek, upset at the prospect of the exams dragging an extra day.        
	The students and their parents blamed the harassment on the flip-flop by the Delhi-based Council for Indian School Certificate Examination, which conducts the all-India exam. The geography question paper was wrongly opened at a centre in Bangalore on March 23. The council had initially decided to cancel the exam only in Bangalore.        
	Around 9.30pm on Tuesday, the night before the test was to be held in the rest of the country, the authorities announced that it would be held on April 2 in all 1,500 centres across India.        
	Its strange that the council took 34 hours to decide that Wednesdays test would be cancelled across the country, said Krishna Bhattacharya, a mother of an examinee from Calcutta Boys School.        
	Several examinees complained that though they had learnt about the postponement from TV news and newspapers, their schools did not confirm it. After reading the councils announcement in todays paper, we desperately tried to check the news with the school. But no one would say anything. We did not want to take a risk and so reached the school in time, said Moumita Das, the mother of an examinee from a Salt Lake school.         
	The officiating chief executive of the council, Gerry Arathoon, pleaded helplessness. The Bangalore school whose employee had wrongly opened the packet containing geography question papers on March 23 informed us about the incident the next day. We needed time to take such a decision.        
	The sudden postponement has put many families planning post-exam holidays and schools planning post-exam admissions and sessions in a fix. Some schools had planned to reopen after the annual recess and start the new session on April 2. According to the earlier schedule, the ICSE exam was to end on April 1.         
	St James School had scheduled the admission test for Class XI for April 2 and 3. Now that the geography exam has been postponed, the Class XI admission process will be delayed, said principal Terence Ireland.        
	The school is now closed after the annual exams and the students had been asked to come for the new session on April 2. We will now have to tell them to return home, said Gilian Hart, the principal of Welland Gouldsmith School.

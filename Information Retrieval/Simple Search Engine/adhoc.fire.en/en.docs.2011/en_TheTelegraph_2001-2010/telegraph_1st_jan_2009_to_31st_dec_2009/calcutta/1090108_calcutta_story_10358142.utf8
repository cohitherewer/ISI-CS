The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hunt for cop   assailants
                                                                                                               Hunt for cop   assailants
          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	Police have started a probe to identify those who allegedly chased and assaulted traffic constable Nepal Chandra Banerjee before confining him to a pharmacy on Kiran Shankar Roy Road on Tuesday.        
	Banerjee stated in the complaint he lodged with Hare Street police station on Tuesday evening that a mob beat him up after he had an altercation with taxi driver Munmun Yadav, who had parked on the wrong side.        
	A constable on duty was assaulted and wrongfully confined. These are cognisable offences. We have started a case against unknown people as the cop could not name his assailants, said joint commissioner (administration) Pradip Kumar Chatterjee.         
	The complaint by Yadav has been forwarded to the Calcutta metropolitan magistrates court. The taxi driver had alleged that Banerjee beat him up after trying to attach an iron clamp to one of the wheels of the taxi.        
	According to the medical report, Yadavs injury was not serious. Besides, he was at fault. As the complaint is non-cognisable, we have forwarded it to the court, seeking instructions. If the court asks us to take action against Banerjee, we will start departmental proceedings, said Chatterjee.

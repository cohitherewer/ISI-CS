The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Plex play goes down to the wire
                                                                                                               Plex play goes down to the wire
          A STAFF REPORTER                                          Tom Hanks    
	Robert Langdons Friday date with city multiplexes hung in the balance till late on Thursday. True to the nature of Dan Browns book, the release row over Angels amp; Demons went down to the wire with confusion being the keyword.         
	Parleys between Sony Pictures and multiplex owners carried on till hours before the Friday first show, following what the plexes termed as unprecedented revenue-sharing percentage demanded by the producers of the Ron Howard-directed Tom Hanks-starrer.        
	We have agreed in principle... although the logistics need to be worked out, we are confident of Angels amp; Demons showing at multiplexes from Friday morning, Kercy Daruwala, the managing director of Sony Pictures, said on Thursday evening.        
	City multiplexes heaved a sigh of relief. With no Bollywood release for close to two months now, not playing Angels amp; Demons would have been a serious setback, said a multiplex official.        
	But a setback was round the corner as talks hit a stumbling block on Thursday night. While there was no official word from Sony Pictures, sources said it was touch and go with the possibility of the film not making it to the multiplexes on Friday. Efforts would be on to release it over the weekend.

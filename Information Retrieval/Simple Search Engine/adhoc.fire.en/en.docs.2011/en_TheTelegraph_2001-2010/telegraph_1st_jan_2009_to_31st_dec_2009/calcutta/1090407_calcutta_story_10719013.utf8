	Medium-pacer Abid Hossain Mollahs line and length has improved since he made his action side-on, on the advice of his coach. Twice a week, the 15-year-old, whose father is a peasant in Subhashgram, cycles 20 minutes, takes a train to Ballygunge and then a bus to Bhowanipore to attend cricket practice.        
	Wicketkeeper-batsman Arka Das has been playing power-packed straight drives since he learnt how to stand on his toes at the moment of contact between the bat and the ball. The 11-year-old looks forward to every session at the nets despite the tiring trip from Belur, where his father runs a small stationery shop.        
	Seventy underprivileged children can now dream of playing for Team India, thanks to the guidance and facilities they are being provided at Devang Gandhis cricket coaching centre in Bhowanipore.        
	The youngsters were handpicked at a trial attended by 1,000 hopefuls in June 2008 and inducted into a programme called Cricket for All.        
	As part of the programme, the budding talents sweat it out under the watchful eyes of Gandhi, Gopal Bose and Utpal Chatterjee, when he is not coaching the state team, between 4.30pm and 7.30pm every Wednesday and Saturday at Ultra Plus Steel Balak Sangha School of Cricket.        
	The underprivileged kids who are part of the programme are showing exemplary tenacity. Most of them have to travel for hours to get here. They want to make every minute they spend here count, said the former Team India Test opener.        
	The results have been encouraging. Although there are 250 kids outside the programme at Balak Sangha, on an average, 10 players from Cricket for All make it to the 16-member age-group squads of the club.        
	Cricket is a tough sport. You have to be dedicated and improve your game continuously, added Gandhi, who has got firms like Ultra Plus Steel, RPG, Peerless, Ambuja Realty, Bengal Sriram and Accord Capital to support the cause. The companies either sponsor sets of 10 to 20 players or provide kits.         
	The programme has been especially beneficial for 17-year-old Bipro Sen, who graduated from second to first division this season, scoring 285 runs for Young Bengal with the highest score of 81 against Bhowanipore. Sens father, who runs a stationery shop, struggles to make ends meet.        
	Bipros coach Gopal Bose, who changed his grip and improved his head position, sees a lot of potential in him but has a word of warning. Calibre and coaching cannot take you all the way. Bipro is on the right track but he has to retain his desire to succeed to make it big.        
	Gandhi, too, put things into perspective. Initial success is one thing but the guys have a long way to go. All they should do is strive towards raising their game each time they take the field, he said.

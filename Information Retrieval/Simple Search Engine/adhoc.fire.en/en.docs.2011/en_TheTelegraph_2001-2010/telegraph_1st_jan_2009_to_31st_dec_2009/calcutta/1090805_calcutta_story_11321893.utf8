          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Biswajit Das, a 35-year-old motorcyclist, was crushed under the wheels of a state bus at the Rashbehari Avenue crossing on Tuesday evening.         
	Police said Das was caught between a taxi and the bus at the intersection. He fell after being hit by the bus from behind and was run over by its rear wheels.        
	He was rushed to SSKM Hospital where he was declared brought dead. His head was smashed, said an officer of Tollygunge police station.        
	The mishap took place around 6.45pm.        
	The bus was speeding. It hit the taxi after knocking down the motorcycle. It was a case of rash and negligent driving, added the officer.        
	Das, a trader from the Regent Park area, was on the way to Tollygunge to meet a friend.         
	The bus was seized and the driver was taken to Tollygunge police station. We have sent the driver to the hospital to ascertain whether he was drunk or not, said another officer.         
	Around 40 local residents and traders put up a roadblock near the crossing to protest the accident. The agitators dispersed after 10 minutes.

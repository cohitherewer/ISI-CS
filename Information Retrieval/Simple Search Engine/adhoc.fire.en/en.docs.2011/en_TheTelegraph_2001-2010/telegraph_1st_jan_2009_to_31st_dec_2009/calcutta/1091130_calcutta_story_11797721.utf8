The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Varsity results spark flurry of complaints
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Varsity results spark flurry of complaints
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Calcutta University (CU) has been flooded with complaints from students and teachers since the publication of the BA and BSc Part I and Part II results on Thursday.        
	A section of examinees expressed unhappiness about their results after getting their marksheets on Friday. The heads of some colleges have pointed out anomalies in the results. We will definitely rectify the results if we find that the allegations are true, said Suranjan Das, the vice-chancellor of the university.         
	The results saw the pass percentages in the BA and BSc Part II honours exams decline by two to three per cent and by four to seven per cent in the BA and BSc Part II general courses. The BA Part I honours and general examinations also witnessed a dip in success rates        
	Many of the complaints are from teachers and students of reputable colleges. A teacher in the Bengali department of Presidency College said most of the girls who had appeared for the BA Part I Bengali honours examination have scored above 60 per cent but none of the boys has crossed the first-class threshold.        
	It is peculiar. We will urge the university authorities to conduct an inquiry and find out why the boys had not done well in the Bengali honours Part I exam. Some of the boys who missed first class are meritorious, said the teacher.        
	A student of another department of Presidency College said he had scored 40 per cent in a paper in which he had answered all the questions correctly and 50 per cent in another paper in which he had attempted only 40 per cent of the questions.         
	Teachers of the sociology and philosophy departments of the college alleged that the marks awarded to the BA Part I examinees were abnormally low.        
	Several students of Scottish Church College have scored first-class marks in BSc Part II economics honours but failed in the pass papers.        
	The students will lose a year since the university rules make it compulsory for all examinees to clear all their pass papers before appearing for Part III.        
	At RK Mission Vidyamandir, Belur, where the chemistry department is known to be one of the best in the state, students complained of unexpectedly poor results in the subject.        
	The anomalies and low marks have prompted the heads of colleges to consider seeking special review of answer scripts.        
	The examinees can appeal to the university authorities for review of only one paper. For review of more than one paper they need permission from the university, for which their colleges have to apply to the authorities.        
	The university grants permission only in special cases, said an official.        
	Presidency principal Sanjib Ghosh has convened a meeting with the heads of the 18 departments on Wednesday to discuss the subject-wise performance of students.        
	We will decide on seeking permission from the university for special reviews after the meeting, said Ghosh.

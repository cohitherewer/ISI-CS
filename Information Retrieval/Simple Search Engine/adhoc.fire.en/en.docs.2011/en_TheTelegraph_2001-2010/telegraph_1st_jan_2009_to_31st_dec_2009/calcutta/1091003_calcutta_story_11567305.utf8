The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Price-rise woes in worship of wealth goddess   Low-key Lakshmi
                                                                                                               Price-rise woes in worship of wealth goddess     - Households prune budgets and guest lists to compensate for 28 per cent jump in rates of puja items          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                                                A woman shops for vegetables at Jadubabur Bazaar in south Calcutta on the eve of Lakshmi puja.

	The goddess of wealth is feeling the price pinch this Lakshmi puja.        
	An average 28 per cent increase in the prices of various commodities since last autumn has forced most Calcuttans to prune their budgets for Saturday nights puja to the bare minimum.        
	We have organised puja at home like every year but our guest list includes only a few relatives. We would earlier invite close to 80 people. A kg of sona moong dal (a must-have for the traditional puja bhog) costs Rs 90 now; how can the average family afford such a luxury? wondered government employee Joyeeta Banerjee, shopping at Gariahat market on Friday.        
	More than 3 lakh households in the city are estimated to organise Lakshmi puja at home, spending Rs 2,000 on an average on the midnight rituals and the vegetarian feast that follows.        
	That translates into something like a Rs 100-crore market, which is huge for a single-day festival that does not include the revelry associated with Durga and Kali puja, said an official of the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authoritys social welfare wing.        
	Going by the prevailing rate charts at New Market, Gariahat and Sealdah, which usually attract the most shoppers on Lakshmi puja-eve, the prices of all items except white poppy seeds have risen sharply since last October.        
	Potato, available for Rs 9 a kg last Lakshmi puja, has burned the biggest hole in the pocket with a more than 100 per cent jump in price. A kg of good-quality potato costs Rs 22 and brinjal is priced at Rs 35, up by around Rs 10. Mustard oil has become dearer by around Rs 8 a litre.                  
	Randhir Kumar Gupta, who owns a shop in New Market, said prices could peak in the fortnight leading to Diwali. The trend has been there all year but the biggest jump was before Id and Durga puja. If there is any possibility of the graph sliding, it will be after Diwali.                                
	Wholesalers blame the poor start to the monsoon and the damage wrought by the cyclone Aila in May for the rising prices.        
	For homemaker Maya Dutta, a resident of Ramgarh, not being able to organise Lakshmi puja the way she would have liked to is the saddest part of the price-rise story. What is the government doing? It has no control over market prices. What bhog will we offer the goddess?         
	The traditional Lakshmi puja fare includes khichuri made of Govindabhog rice and sona moong dal, accompanied by fried brinjal and spinach, potato and cauliflower curry, tomato chutney and payesh.        
	Ramen Saha, a trader at Sealdah market, said business volumes were definitely lower than last year. The flow of customers hasnt been affected but people are buying less because of the price rise.

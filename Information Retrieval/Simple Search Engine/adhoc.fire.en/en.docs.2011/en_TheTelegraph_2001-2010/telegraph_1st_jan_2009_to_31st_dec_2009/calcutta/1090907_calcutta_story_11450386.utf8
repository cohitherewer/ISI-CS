The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cop scan on malls for safe shopping
                                                                                                               Cop scan on malls for safe shopping
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Sleuths of the detective department have launched a crackdown on snatchers and lifters as part of their pre-Puja drive, arresting 25 suspects at various markets over the past week.        
	Officers said those in the net, including eight women, were expert in lifting wallets or purses in crowded areas.        
	Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters), said pre-Puja preventive arrests were being made across the city.         
	We are keeping an eye on wholesale and retail markets as well as shopping malls. Policewomen in plainclothes, too, have been deployed as we have information that a large number of female lifters are active in the city, Shamim said.        
	Cops in mufti have been posted at all trade hubs, such as Burrabazar and Posta, and also in front of shopping centres in the New Market, Park Street, Camac Street, Shakespeare Sarani, Elgin Road and Prince Anwar Shah Road areas.        
	Apart from city-based lifters, the cops are also training their guns on those from the districts as well as other states who flock to Calcutta when Puja shopping is at its peak.        
	Snatchers and lifters from Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar make Calcutta their hunting ground every year before Puja. They mostly put up in rented houses in the suburbs to avoid our vigil, said an officer of the detective department.        
	A section of snatchers and lifters has mastered the art of picking a purse after cutting open a bag in crowded spots. A group shadows buyers for sometime to assess how much cash they are carrying. Another group enters shops or malls and lifts the purses, taking advantage of the crowd and the victims preoccupation with shopping, said the officer.        
	There is yet another group comprising people who the police call kepmars. They are the most dangerous. They strike up conversation with their targets and win their confidence by offering help. Some buyers make the mistake of asking the snatchers to hold their bags for a while. Within seconds, the new-found friends melt in the crowd with the bags, the officer said.        
	Securitymen deployed by the mall authorities have been asked to monitor the closed-circuit TV camera feed and alert the police if they spot anyone roaming suspiciously.        
	The police have advice for shoppers, too. It will be safe for them to carry debit or credit card instead of cash. They should not interact with strangers and always be on guard, said a senior officer at Lalbazar.

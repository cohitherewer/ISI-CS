The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Plans on for donor stem cell registry 
                                                                                                               Plans on for donor stem cell registry 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	City patients suffering from thalassaemia and leukaemia will soon be able to undergo stem cell therapy with tissues from unrelated donors at a lower price.        
	A team of haematologists from India and abroad are planning to set up a blood-and- bone marrow stem cell donor registry in various cities, including Calcutta, to facilitate the transplant. The process to set up the unrelated donors registry has started and will be established in all major cities, said John Goldman, of Imperial College, London, a pioneer in stem cell research.        
	Goldman is in the city to take part in a symposium on new frontiers in haematology and oncology, organised by Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Cancer Research Institute.        
	Goldman said a patient who wanted to undergo a stem cell transplantation but could not find a donor in the family had to get it from Europe or the US. The procedure there costs around $10,000 to $15,000.        
	But if the donor is available in India, the cost comes down by 50 per cent, he said.        
	India has hospitals which have transplantation units and specialists. The only thing required is the registry, said Goldman. The process will be established in all major cities.        
	Once the donor is identified, the stem cell samples are collected from the blood or saliva. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching is done. HLA is the major histocompatibility complex in humans. It is a protein that differentiates the cells of one human being from another. Once the HLA type is matched, the patient can undergo the transplantation.         
	Doctors said blood or bone marrow cell transplant increases the chance of recovery in case of critical blood disorders. The chance of recovery in the early stage of leukaemia is 50-60 per cent and 20 per cent in the advanced stage, said Goldman.

  - Tech tools in play for ICSE amp; ISC marks on May 20          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	As India tunes in to the outcome of the Lok Sabha poll on Saturday, nearly 40,000 students could be logging in to register for another set of results.         
	The Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations announced on Friday evening that the ICSE and ISC results for 2009 would be declared at 11am on May 20 through school-specific lists on notice boards, a comprehensive one on its official website and via email and SMS.        
	Apart from accessing the complete results online at www.cisce.org straightaway, students who register in advance for the new email and SMS facility will be directly informed about their individual performances. The initiative is meant to reduce the anxiety of students if they cannot get through to the website because of heavy traffic, said Gerry Arathoon, the additional secretary and officiating chief executive and secretary of the council.        
	Registration of names for results through email and SMS started last week and will close at 6am on D-Day.        
	Till last year, most students would go online to know their results but find it difficult to access the councils website.         
	The marksheets would generally reach the students through their schools a day or two after the announcement of the results.        
	The council has for the first time made arrangements for principals to receive school-specific results through email at 11am sharp that day. The marksheets will be despatched the same afternoon.        
	A comparison of performances in every subject along with a detailed analysis of the overall results of both the ICSE and ISC exams will also be made available to the principals on Wednesday, Arathoon said.        
	Schools would earlier receive the detailed analysis nearly eight months after the declaration of results.

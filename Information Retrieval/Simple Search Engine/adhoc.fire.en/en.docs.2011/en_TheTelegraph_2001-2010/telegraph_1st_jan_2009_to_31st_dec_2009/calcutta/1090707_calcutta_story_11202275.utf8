          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A Citu-backed organisation held up students and office-goers for hours at Nagerbazar crossing on Monday morning to stage the first demonstration against the July 31 phase-out deadline for old commercial vehicles set by the court.         
	The blockade by Patha Nirapatta Prochesta Committee from 10am to 1pm, threw traffic out of gear on Dum Dum Road and Jessore Road.         
	The secretary of the organisation, whose members work for seven bus routes, threatened more disruptions if the government did not pray for an extension of the deadline and the court complied.         
	Dummy candidates: Eleven youths from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and other states were arrested at Kendriya Vidyalaya 1 in Salt Lake on Sunday for allegedly appearing as dummy candidates in the Madhya Pradesh pre-medical test. The youths were produced in the ACJM court on Monday and remanded in custody for 14 days.        
	Howrah arrest: A police team from Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh arrested Rakesh Yadav, 40, in Howrah on Sunday night. The police claimed 31 cases of murder and abduction were pending against Rakesh, who was living in a rented room in Dobson Lane. He was produced in court for transit remand.        
	Guardians protest: Parents of the students of St Helens School in Watkins Lane in Howrah demonstrated in front of the campus on Monday morning to protest arbitrary charges imposed by the authorities.

	Six rounds of brilliant quizzing was what made the inter-school quiz competition  hosted by Aditya Academy Senior Secondary School, Barasat, on February 7  an event to remember.        
	There were two visual rounds, one choice round and finally, the rapid fire or the decisive round, in which each of the four teams had to answer 10 questions in a minute. From identifying Zakumi, the mascot of the 2010 Fifa World Cup, to a rare picture of Rajiv and Sonia Gandhi, the four finalists crossed every hurdle with panach. In the end, Apeejay School, Salt Lake, scored a grand victory. Army School, Barrackpore, came second.         
	Organised for students from classes VI to VIII, the preliminary rounds of the quiz saw seven city schools fighting it out with each team being asked a set of 15 questions each. The four finalist teams  named after Nandalal Bose, Jhumpa Lahiri, Sourav Ganguly and Ravi Shankar  included Aditya Academy, Rodkal, and the host school.         
	We enjoyed the quiz. It helped that we knew most of the answers, laughed Arkaketan Chatterjee of Apeejay. His only regret was failing to answer the collective term for owls (parliament).         
	The winning team got a trophy and books. The awards were handed over by Nirmal Bose, the chief secretary of Aditya Academy Senior Secondary School.        
	We organised the quiz to initiate interaction among students of different schools. Such competitions also sharpen the general knowledge of kids, which cannot come from classroom lessons alone, said Apala Chakrabarty, the principal of Aditya Academy Senior Secondary School, Barasat.  
	Old boys rsquo; meet  
	Scottish Church Collegiate School organised its first-ever alumni meet on Feb ruary 7 at the college assembly hall. From 96-year-old Dibyendu Mohan Sen, a former judge, to well-known advocate Snehasis Sur (batch of 1941), old boys turned up in huge numbers. Others included for mer Bengal cricketer Kalyan Mitra, singer Anindya Chatterjee (of Chandrabindoo fa- me), anchor Padmanabha Das and others. Sayantan Das, a student of the school and the current under-12 world champion in chess, and Bitan Bhar, who stood fifth in the Higher Secondary examination 2008 and Rajdeep Mitra, a rising badminton star, were felicitated on the occasion.

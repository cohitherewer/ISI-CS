The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Civic body demands Parkomat dues
                                                                                                               Civic body demands Parkomat dues
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                           The chief minister at Rawdon Street Parkomat. A Telegraph picture                                  
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has asked its private partner in the Parkomat projects to pay up its dues of around Rs 4 crore following a spate of queries from the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG).        
	The dues include an interest-free loan of Rs 3 crore which was given to Simplex Projects to build the Rawdon Street Parkomat.        
	The automatic parking lots on Rawdon Street and under Lindsay Street came up in a joint venture of the civic body and Simplex Projects.        
	Its unjustified to give public money as interest-free loan to a private company, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.        
	The loan was granted during the tenure of the former Trinamul-BJP board headed by Subrata Mukherjee.        
	Simplex chairman B.K. Mundra said he had received a letter from the CMC seeking the refund but refused to say whether the company would cough up the money.        
	Sources said the move to claim the money could be linked to queries from the CAG, which has pointed out that the CMC could have earned Rs 1.8 crore if it had charged interest for the loan.        
	The CMC was asked to explain why the project was accepted without a viability study. Besides, no study was conducted to identify the risk factors, if any, said a source in the civic body.        
	As for the Lindsay Street parking lot, the CMC has asked for the outstanding rent at the rate of Rs 60 per sq m and 5 per cent of the gross revenue, which Simplex had committed to pay in the agreement.        
	While the mayor has passed the irregularity buck to the Trinamul board, former mayor Subrata Mukherjee said: The proposal for the interest-free loan was finalised during the tenure of the previous CPM-led board. We had just implemented it.

                                                                                                               JU staff cry bias
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Teachers and other employees of Jadavpur University have accused the authorities of shielding an employee arrested for bank fraud.        
	According to JU rules, an employee has to be suspended within 48 hours of being arrested. The accused, a cartographer in the geology department, was arrested last week but the authorities are yet to suspend him.        
	The accused had allegedly taken a home loan from a city bank by producing forged documents. A source alleged he had forged the signature of JUs finance officer.         
	The teachers and other employees said the authorities were biased in favour of the accused because of his links with the CPM.        
	JU officials denied they were going soft on any accused. We have received unconfirmed reports about the arrest. We can suspend him only after we get an official confirmation, said registrar Pradip Kumar Ghosh.         
	The protesting employees claimed the police had informed the university about the arrest.

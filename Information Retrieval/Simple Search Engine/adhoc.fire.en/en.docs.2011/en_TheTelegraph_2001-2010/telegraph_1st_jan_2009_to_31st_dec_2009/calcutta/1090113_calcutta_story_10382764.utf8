The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Wanted: right to breathe
                                                                                                               Wanted: right to breathe
                            
	Metro has been running a sustained campaign against auto pollution. Our inbox has been flooded by your emails on how vital this war is for the city...        
	I shifted to Calcutta from Delhi a few years ago. Within a week of my arrival, I was stuck in a traffic jam for around 20 minutes, with the fumes of an autorickshaw filling up the vehicle I was travelling in.         
	That was enough to land me in hospital. Before taking me home, my parents bought a nebuliser and hired an oxygen cylinder. I was nebulised with steroids for the next two weeks. This is how I was welcomed by the city of joy.... How can someone even suggest that it is okay to earn a living when that is causing half the population of the city to suffer from acute breathing trouble?        
	I have a right to live a normal life, and I want it.        
	Katyani Gupta, Class X              
	My wish list for the New Year is a pollution-free city with no two-stroke autos on the road.        
	Kajal Chatterjee, Sodepur               
	Polluting two-stroke autos continue to ply on the streets of Calcutta because the administration is spineless and the people of the city are infinitely tolerant. It is time for every citizen to join the campaign against vehicular pollution. They can start by stopping autos and other polluting vehicles from plying in their respective localities.

	Subhas Chakraborty bluffs regularly. He has his compulsions, after all  like keeping his boys happy at the cost of public health.        
	Santosh Chakravarty, Behala               
	Perhaps a bit of Gandhigiri can save us  boycott autos till they adhere to pollution-control norms. I am 70 years old and too weak to take on the politicians, but I have vowed not to board an auto till they abide by pollution norms.        
	Kalyan Kumar Ghose, Bangur Avenue                 
	Why is Mamata Banerjee blindly supporting the errant auto drivers? Isnt she aware that they are poisoning the air we breathe?        
	Tuneer Bondhopadhyay, Salt Lake              
	The results of the opinion poll on auto pollution show that 76 per cent of the people believe the high courts ban, if implemented, will help clean the citys air while 67 per cent support it. But will all of them refrain from travelling by a polluting auto if the government fails to take any action? I think the menace will be automatically wiped out if people stop boarding these polluting three-wheelers. But going by how Calcuttans generally react when asked to embrace change, they will grumble and offer a thousand excuses for travelling by an auto.        
	A. Roy Mukherjee, PK Guha Road         
	Perhaps the only option left is to ban all autos. Once the Nano arrives, it can be commercially used as an alternative to autos!        
	A.S. Mehta, New Alipore               
	I bought myself a New Years gift last week  an inhaler.

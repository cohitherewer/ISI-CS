	Apropos Culture amp; Cramps, July 5, the observations on Indian Council of Cultural Relation (ICCR)s Rabindranath Tagore Centre, are based on gross misinformation, which makes it imperative to refute them.             
	The article describes the centres galleries as cramped. This is a misrepresentation of facts. The four galleries, spread over several floors with natural light streaming in through glass panels and striking granite and wood flooring, are very spacious.           
	According to the article, the centre has had a short but sad year-long history. This is a malicious comment since without doubt in this year the centre has travelled a long way to becoming a cultural hub of Calcutta.           
	The various venues at the centre have hosted over 100 cultural events in the past year. Several of them were sponsored by the ICCR and the rest privately organised by those who have rented the venues. This latter aspect is important for the ICCR to generate revenue to contribute towards the maintenance and security of the centre.           
	Contrary to the unfortunate conclusion in the article that the ICCR must be spending lakhs with so little to show for it, the centre has been able to attract a range of international programmes from ICCR Delhi that have avoided Calcutta so long because of logistics and can now be accommodated free of cost on its premises.           
	The comment that the centres website displays an utter lack of taste and refinement is uncalled for. The website, launched on the first anniversary of the centre, is arguably one of the best websites of the ICCR  visually informative and user-friendly.           
	I appeal to The Telegraph not to tarnish our reputation and try and demolish the standing that we have earned by dint of hard work.           
	Dr Reba Som, director, Rabindranath Tagore Centre, ICCR             Letters on reports appearing   in Metro may be sent to:

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | SFI routed in JU elections
                                                                                                               SFI routed in JU elections
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The SFI failed to win a single seat in Jadavpur Universitys engineering and technology students union elections, the results of which were announced on Friday.         
	The five seats of the faculty of engineering and technology students union (Fetsu) went to the supporters of the Democratic Students Front (DSF). The apolitical group, allegedly backed by Naxalites, has been winning the elections since 1977. This years polls were held on Thursday. We are not surprised by the defeat because the SFI has not won the Fetsu elections for several years. This years results are encouraging because our candidates bagged nearly 10 per cent more votes than previous years, said Koustav Chatterjee, the general secretary of the state committee of the SFI.        
	Supporters of the DSF said they were confident that they would win.         
	We highlighted the land acquisition issue, especially at Singur, during our campaign. The students have accepted our views on the matter. We also focused on the work we have done to address students problems like placement and examination reforms, said Abhishek Chakraborty, a Fetsu leader.        
	The elections of the JU arts and science faculty students unions are scheduled for March 31.        
	We the Independents and the Forum for Arts Students, two anti-SFI bodies, have been winning the elections for the past few years at the university.        
	Chatterjee said the SFI was confident of a much better show this time. We will do much better in the coming arts and science faculty elections, he said.

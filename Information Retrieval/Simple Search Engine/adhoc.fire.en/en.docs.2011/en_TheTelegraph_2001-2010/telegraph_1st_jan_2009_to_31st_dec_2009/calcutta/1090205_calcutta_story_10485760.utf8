The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CU gears up to declare results online
                                                                                                               CU gears up to declare results online
          A STAFF REPORTER                                             
	Calcutta University (CU) is all set to take the tech route to minimise hassles faced by students during admission and publication of results.        
	Suranjan Das, the vice-chancellor of the university, revealed the tech plans during the launch of a book on Wednesday. The book, Changing Identity of Rural India, published in collaboration with an Italian university.        
	There is a long, anxious wait between the meeting of the universitys results committee and the publication of results and mark sheets reaching students. This can be minimised by announcing the results online, said Das.        
	Now, representatives of each college have to collect the gazette from the university and put it up on the campus notice board, where students jostle for a glimpse of the list.        
	All students who sit for the Part I, Part II and Part III examinations in both the old and new syllabi in 2009 will be able to log on to CUs official website, www.caluniv.ac.in, to check their scores, Das said.        
	Last year, we could not go online because of technical reasons, but there shouldnt be any problem this year, the vice-chancellor added.        
	But the success of the online publication will hinge on the websites capability to handle the load, as around 1 lakh students will log on almost at the same time. The results websites of several institutions have crashed, failing to cope with the heavy traffic.        
	CU sources, however, said an IT company had been engaged to make the process smooth.        
	The university is also planning to launch a second website, dedicated to undergraduate results.        
	As part of the tech targets, a list of all the colleges affiliated to CU will be put up on the website for the 2009 admission season. The list will include details of all the 175 colleges under CU, subjects offered and the number of seats in each department.        
	There is usually a rush for some courses in a particular college while seats in other colleges offering the same courses remain vacant. An online ready reckoner will distribute the load among the colleges, said Das.        
	This will also help discourage the practice of taking in more students than the colleges are allowed to, felt Das.

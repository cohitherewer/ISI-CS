                                                                                                               Howrah extortionists vandalise house 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A youth gang vandalised a house in Shibpur after a woman who was staying there refused to cough up 30,000 on Saturday night. The gang also assaulted her friend who had come to meet her.        
	The house belongs to Tapas Kumar Sen, a senior official of a nationalised bank.        
	According to an FIR lodged with Chatterjeehat police outpost, the youths damaged Sens car, broke electronic goods and set some furniture on fire. Two men have been arrested. We are trying to track down another two, said an officer.        
	The police said Sen had asked sister-in-law Mallika Banerjee, a resident of Andul Road, to stay in the three-storeyed house in Mahesh Pal Lane for 10 days as the family would be out on vacation.        
	Chandranath Sarkar, a friend of mine, turned up around 8pm. While he was leaving half an hour later, we found that around 20 youths who had organised a Kali puja last night had surrounded the house and blocked the gate, recalled Mallika, 32, who works in a private company.        
	The youths demanded Rs 30,000 for the puja. When I refused, the gang ransacked the house, damaged the car and beat up Chandranath. They also tried to drug me but were prevented by some neighbours, said Mallika.        
	Sen, who was in Jharkhand, rushed back after hearing about the incident.

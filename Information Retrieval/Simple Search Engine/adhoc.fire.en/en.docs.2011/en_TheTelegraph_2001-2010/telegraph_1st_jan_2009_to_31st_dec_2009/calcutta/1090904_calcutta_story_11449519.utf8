The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tech student missing for 4 days
                                                                                                               Tech student missing for 4 days
          A STAFF REPORTER                      Atish Sen Gupta                          
	A 20-year-old student of electrical engineering has been missing from Sunday and the cops are clueless about his whereabouts.        
	Atish Sen Gupta, a first-year student of a private engineering college in Beleghata, left his Kasba home in a rush after receiving a call on the landline on Sunday evening. There has been no word from him since.        
	He was with his grandmother when he received a call around 6pm and left home promising to be back within an hour. His cellphone was not working and he did not even carry his wallet, said Dipankar Sengupta, Atishs father.        
	He was wearing an orange T-shirt, blue trousers and a pair of black slippers when he left home. He must have been in a hurry as he did not even carry his inhaler. Atish suffers from asthma from an early age, the anxious father added.        
	The family lodged a missing diary with the Kasba police station late on Sunday and later on Tuesday filed another complaint with the CID.        
	No ransom call has been received but a few blank calls from a number later traced to that of the ordnance factory board line has left the family puzzled.        
	Sources said Atish, a former student of Better High School in Golf Green, would frequent the mall at Hiland Park and South City Mall.        
	He is very shy, an introvert. He always used to hang around with a small group of friends and never went out for late nights, said Joyita, Atishs distraught mother.        
	The Sen Gupta family claimed that the missing boy was spotted once near Prince Anwar Shah Road on Monday and at Budge Budge station on Tuesday.        
	We rushed to those spots and tried to ask around but we failed to get a lead, said a relative of Atish.        
	We are probing all angles of the case. We have already questioned his friends and relatives. We have got some clues and are working on them, said S.K. Chowdhury, the additional superintendent of police (industrial) of South 24-Parganas.        
	Cops are checking Atishs cellphone records and his Orkut profile in their hunt for clues.        
	The family, meanwhile, is beginning to despair with every passing hour.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | What, no cooking? Rally off, zoo on
                                                                                                               What, no cooking? Rally off, zoo on
  - CPM trio face boos for spoiling Bankura broth on Maidan          ZEESHAN JAWED                          Rallyists from Bankura argue with police personnel on being asked to stop cooking on the Maidan on Sunday. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                        
	A group of CPM workers from Bankura and their families booed three senior party leaders and boycotted Sundays Left Front rally to visit the zoo after being asked not to cook on the Maidan.        
	Ban, what ban? Back home, we cook in the fields and nobody stops us from doing so, said an angry not-so-young man who everyone addressed as Poltu da.         
	Party leaders Avik Dutta, Madan Ghosh and Niranjan Chatterjee said the high courts order was not to be messed with from now on, but Poltu da wouldnt take no for an answer. We have been coming to the Brigade (Parade Ground) since childhood and no rally is complete without a meal here.        
	When one of the leaders reminded the group of Left Front boss Biman Boses undertaking to the army not to damage the Maidan, Poltu da and his men  and their families  cooked up a storm.         
	Someone in the group kicked a vessel of rice, spilling the contents on the ground. Another swore as he put the uncooked fish away. End of picnic.        
	Why should we take the trouble of coming all the way from Bankura if we cant even cook a meal on the Maidan? Lets go to the zoo, Poltu da ordered.        
	Everyone  men, women and children  instantly headed for the two buses that had brought them to the city. But neither vehicle could be brought out because other buses and lorries were parked in front, prompting a change in plan.        
	We will walk, Poltu da said.        
	Team Bankura stomped off the Maidan after stashing the utensils and rations in the boot.         
	Half of the 120-odd visitors were women and children. They were among the earliest to descend on the Maidan on Sunday morning and mark territory behind Mohammedan Sporting Club.         
	When we spotted them around 10.30am, a vessel containing 10kg of rice was on the chullah, a police officer said.         
	A breakfast of muri and tea was over by then, and the women had begun cleaning the fish and chopping onions and tomatoes. They were the first to revolt when the police arrived. The women abused us, the police officer said.         
	The three CPM leaders arrived a little later hoping to succeed where the 15-member police team had failed, only to be greeted by slogans against the high court order and the party leadership. We dont care whether the high court or the party has banned cooking, the group shouted.         
	Chatterjee gestured to Poltu da to let him speak. Our leader Biman Bose has had to give in writing that no harm will be done to the Maidan. If you cook here it will amount to contempt of court and our leaders might even be arrested. Why dont you go elsewhere and eat before the rally starts? he said.         
	Ghosh, a member of the CPMs central committee, argued that the high courts ban on chullahs in the vicinity of Victoria Memorial and parking on the Maidan hadnt been thrust on the rally brigade all of a sudden. We had informed your district leaders that you wouldnt be allowed to cook on the Maidan. You should have brought cooked food with you. You cannot light a fire here.        
	The reprimand lit Poltu das fire.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Kidney laws amp; loopholes
                                                                                                               Kidney laws amp; loopholes
          SANJAY MANDAL                          Manik Chowdhury, the alleged kingpin of the kidney racket                                  
	The arrest of eight persons in the city this month for running a nation-wide kidney racket has revealed the extent of the problem and exposed the loopholes in organ transplantation laws. Metro takes a look at how the rules are flouted, the problems that authorities supposedly face and possible solutions.              
	WHAT THE RULES SAY        
	Any hospital that decides to conduct organ transplantation has to seek the state health departments permission. According to the Transplantation of Human Organs Act of 1994 and the Transplantation of Human Organs Rules, 1995, a kidney may be donated by a near relative (father, mother, children, wife, brother) or by someone whose only motive is to save a life.        
	In the first category, a series of medical tests are to be conducted by the hospital to establish that the donor and the recipient are near relatives. Once cleared, the kidney transplant takes place.        
	In the second category, the prospective donor and recipient are referred to a government ethics committee after they clear the medical tests. The panel meets twice a month to interview donors and recipients. They are to give a declaration each that no money will be paid before or after the transplant.              
	HOW THE RACKET THRIVES        
	The transplant racket thrives because there is no way to establish that a donor who is not a near relative of the patient has stepped in out of compassion. The declarations are often false and there is no foolproof method yet to detect fraud.        
	In some hospitals, cases are not even referred to the ethics committee. Donors who are not related to the recipients produce fake papers to pass off as relatives.                
	WHAT ABOUT CADAVER ORGAN TRANSPLANT        
	Not a single cadaver transplant has taken place in Bengal in the past two years. The authorities blame lack of awareness for cadaver transplantation not taking off in the state. But proponents of cadaver transplantation say most hospitals dont even try to convince families of prospective recipients and donors to opt for it.              
	WHAT IS THE SOLUTION        
	Experts say cadaver organ transplantation is the only way to stop kidneys from being sold.        
	The government had set up a brain stem death declaration authorisation committee in 2006 and issued a notification for cadaver organ transplant the next year. According to the notification, a patient suffering trauma or neurological injuries and put on ventilator support can be declared brain dead even if his/her cardiovascular system is functioning.        
	If the family agrees, the doctor and the hospital superintendent can inform the panel about a prospective cadaver donation. Two experts will certify that he/she is brain dead.

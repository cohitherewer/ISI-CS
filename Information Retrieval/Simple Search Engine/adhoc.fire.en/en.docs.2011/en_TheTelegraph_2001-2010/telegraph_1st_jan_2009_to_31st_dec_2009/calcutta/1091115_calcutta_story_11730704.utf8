										      eyewitness                        A work by Satish Gujral on display at Aakriti Art Gallery				                           
	Satish Gujral is one of Indias most well-known artists belonging to an equally famous family.         
	His elder brother, I.K. Gujral, was once the prime minister. The artist was born in 1925 in Jhelum, now in Pakistan, and lost his hearing at an early age. He joined the Mayo School of Art in Lahore, and thereafter moved to the Sir JJ School of Art in Mumbai. He won a scholarship and went to Mexico to be apprenticed with Diego Rivera and David Siqueiros.         
	Having witnessed the Partition, the suffering and the bloodshed, Gujrals early works expressed the violence and horror of those days through tortured and contorted figures and a whirlwind of brushstrokes.         
	Those were quite powerful works, reflecting the heroic style of the Mexican muralists and voiced the concerns and woes of an entire generation of refugees from Punjab after it was torn asunder.        
	Some may consider Gujral the architect even more interesting than Gujral the artist, for while we have many eminent artists, we have produced few world-class architects. Gujrals design for the Belgian embassy in New Delhi has won many accolades. He was hailed in the foreign press as his work looked so Indian  his colours were so earthy.        
	Subsequently, in the 1980s, he began creating what he called brunt wood sculptures  actually charred wood carved to resemble Ganeshas, at a time when images of the elephant-headed god was a must-have. These were partially covered with gold leaf and decorated with vermilion and beads to resemble wayside deities.         
	The current exhibition at Aakriti has some of those deities on display, only Gujral calls them burnt wood now like the rest of us.        
	This exhibition demonstrates once again that this octogenarian artist is not angst-ridden any longer. His art  be it painting or sculpture  is seriously decorative now, notwithstanding the overt influence of socialist realism. The theme of these works is the joy of man-machine relationships, and in keeping with this philosophy, men and women or couples exist in communion with the contraptions they have created.        
	The surface of each painting is so smooth that it could have been industrially processed. The machines look like mutated spinning wheels, bicycles and industrial equipment furnished with leather belts, and wheels.         
	The golden bike has the head of a bull, and a bull has piscine eyes. Birds flutter out of a contraption resembling a concrete mixer. They perch on the handlebar of a machine, while kites hang from another bar. These machines are meant for both work and play.         
	The background of these paintings is in brilliant colours, while lines define the idealised figures and the machines.        
	Gujrals sculptures are two-dimensional  the bulls and figures are defined more by lines than volume. It is amazing that Gujral has single-handedly created this huge body of work at his age.         
	Aakriti has released on the occasion, 500 limited edition books on Gujrals work and a monograph on him as well. This is in continuation of Aakritis series of monographs on contemporary Indian artists.

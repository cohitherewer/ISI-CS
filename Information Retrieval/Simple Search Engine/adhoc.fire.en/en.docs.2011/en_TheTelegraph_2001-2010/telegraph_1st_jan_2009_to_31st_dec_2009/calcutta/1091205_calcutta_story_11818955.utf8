	Calcutta comes alive to the sound of the hills this weekend as the Dr Grahams Homes Choir keeps its annual winter tryst.        
	In its ninth visit to town, the 65-member choir from the Kalimpong hills sounded the opening bars of the Yuletide spirit with their voices ringing across the St Pauls Cathedral on Friday evening.        
	The Rising Stars in Concert series moves to Tollygunge Club on Saturday and the Royal Calcutta Turf Club (RCTC) on Sunday, in association with The Telegraph.        
	Hitting another high note this weekend will be the auction of a used bat and cap signed and gifted to the Homes for this purpose by a certain Mr Sachin Tendulkar. The maestros bat will have a base price of Rs 2 lakh.        
	But for once, the spotlight will be on little masters of a different kind. If Friday saw some strict classical singing with Christmas hymns, carols and pop songs such as I Believe laced with Ave Maria in the background and Greatest Gift of All, the choir will come up with a less traditional repertoire at Tolly and RCTC as members go solo with four-part harmonies in the background. From Evanescence and Beatles to Michael Jackson and Jai Ho! the choir promises a mixed bag of contemporary tunes to complement the carols.        
	We dont believe in straitjacketing our children. They sing whatever they enjoy singing. It makes the choir more versatile than any other, says Michael Robertson, the chairman and president of Dr Grahams Homes.        
	Like every year, former students of the Home such as Tashi and Ben Westley, who now play with city bands, will join the choir. But missing in action at the two clubs will be one of the showstealers from the Cathedral.        
	Prayas Bishwakarma, just 11 but a little magician with bow and string, is off to Hyderabad for the semi-finals of a Global Music Competition in violin organised by Lions International. One of the youngest members of the choir, Prayas won the district and state levels and if he manages to impress the judges with Henryk Wieniawskis Polonaise Brillante and Vivaldis Summer, the two pieces he played at the Cathedral, he will make it to the grand finale in Sydney.        
	Prayas was absorbed by the Home last year after we heard him perform at a concert. The speed of his fingers and the swing and emotion in his playing is amazing. It is the schools dream to see him play with the best philharmonic orchestra, says choirmaster Shane Saviel.        
	Prayas is one of the many pristine talents that have found a platform thanks to Kalimpongs unique childrens village that is now home to 750 students from across the country. Founded in 1900 by Scottish missionary John Anderson Graham with six children on a remote hillside, Dr Grahams Homes aims to provide care and training to destitute children.        
	The choir has grown so much. Weve been invited to perform in Delhi, Sikkim, the UK and Japan. Now theres a huge demand to get into the choir. I hold auditions in February and after hearing their voices, slot them into soprano, alto, tenor and bass groups, says Shane.

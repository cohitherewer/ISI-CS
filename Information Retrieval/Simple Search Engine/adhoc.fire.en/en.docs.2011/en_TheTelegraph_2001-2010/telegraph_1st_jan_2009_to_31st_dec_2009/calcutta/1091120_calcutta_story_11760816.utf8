The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hard yet soft on   bus owners
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Hard yet soft on   bus owners
          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	A Bengal minister has for the first time announced punitive action against owners of banned polluting buses who havent yet applied for replacements, but left the door ajar for compromise by promising to accept genuine reasons for non-compliance.        
	We will cancel the permits of around 1,000 bus operators, transport minister Ranjit Kundu told Metro on Thursday.        
	He also ruled out setting another deadline  the last one lapsed on October 31  but added in the same breath that some of the errant operators deserved a fair chance.        
	Kundu said 200-odd vehicle owners had cited valid reasons and genuine constraints for not replacing their old vehicles.         
	The transport department had issued showcause notices to the 1,200-odd bus operators who missed the October 31 deadline, giving them a fortnight to reply. Thursday was the last date for sending their replies.        
	A transport department official said cancelling permits was not the solution because the city desperately needed buses on the road.        
	For green activists, Kundus offer of a second chance to some operators reeked of the trademark government tactics of one step forward-two steps back in the fight against foul air. The bus operators had enough time to sort out these problems but didnt, so why is the government still thinking of giving them a chance? demanded emission expert S.M. Ghosh.

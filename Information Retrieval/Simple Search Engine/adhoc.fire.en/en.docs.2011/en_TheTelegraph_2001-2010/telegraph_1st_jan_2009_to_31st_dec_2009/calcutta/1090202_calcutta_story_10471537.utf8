The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Family denies cop claim
                                                                                                               Family denies cop claim
          A STAFF REPORTER                           Yashs father Anil. (Amit Datta)                                  
	The cops called it a revenge killing, but the Lakhotias have linked the murder to ransom. The cops suspect Santosh Singh as the mastermind who had been close to the Lakhotias, but the family claimed it had nothing to do with him.         
	Yash Lakhotias father Anil ruled out the police theory that business rivalry was behind the murder and denied having ever had any business dealings with Santosh.         
	Anil owns a sweet shop, Panch Bhog, on GT Road and is also into real estate.         
	I cannot understand why anybody would kill my son to take revenge on me, Anil said at a hurriedly called press conference on Sunday afternoon.        
	According to him, the family had given a list of seven suspects to the police but refused to reveal the names. All I can say is that they had worked with us, said Anil, seated beside elder brother Nandu.         
	About Santosh, Nandu said: He was just our customer. Everyone in Howrah knows him to be a criminal and so do we. We never had any business dealings with him.        
	Despite repeated attempts, police superintendent Niraj Kumar Singh could not be reached for his comments on the familys claims.         
	The cops have all along been claiming revenge to be the motive behind the abduction and murder, carried out by business rivals of the Lakhotias. During the course of the probe, they came to know that the plot was masterminded by Santosh, who, they claimed, was close to the Lakhotias.        
	It is strange that they are now trying to dissociate themselves from Santosh. We have learnt about him from the family itself, said a senior police officer.         
	The Lakhotias, the sleuths claimed, had used Santosh, who had criminal antecedents, to seal some realty deals and fallen out with him over a payment dispute.         
	The cops are also surprised at the Lakhotias claim that Yash was kidnapped for ransom, as the family did not receive any such demand.         
	If the police are to be believed, Santosh, originally from Samastipur in Bihar, is an old hand at kidnapping and is wanted in at least two such cases in that state.         
	A source close to the Lakhotias explained the reason behind the sudden change in the familys stand. Santosh is still at large and he has a well-oiled crime machinery in Howrah. After Yashs death, the family is not willing to take chances and so they are not saying anything openly against him.

                                                                                                               Ransack over attendance
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	First-year girls of Milli Al Amim College, along with outsiders, allegedly ransacked the premises and heckled non-teaching staff on Tuesday after being denied permission to sit for Part I because of inadequate attendance and poor performance.        
	About 40 students of the girls college near Nonapukur tram depot have been barred from appearing for Part I after failing to score the qualifying marks in the internal tests or falling short on attendance. Tuesday was the last date for filling forms for the university examination.        
	About 150 students and their friends broke lights, damaged furniture and heckled staff, demanding grace attendance and grace marks, said the college authorities.        
	We cannot allow students to sit for the university exams if they do poorly in the internal exams and do not have the minimum attendance, said Mohammed Nizamuddin, the president of the administrative committee of the college.        
	Tuesdays incident was reported to police and security arrangements will be made to enable teachers and other staff members to attend the college on Wednesday, said Nizamuddin.         
	The teachers alleged that many of the barred students hardly attend classes. Some of the others have scored in the 10s and 20s out of 100 in the internal tests.        
	There is no point running a college if the students pressure us to accept this kind of illegitimate demands, said a teacher.

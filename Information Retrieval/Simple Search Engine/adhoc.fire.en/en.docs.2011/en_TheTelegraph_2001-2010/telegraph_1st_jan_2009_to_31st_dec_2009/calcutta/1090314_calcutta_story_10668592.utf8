                                                                                                               Sourav Gangulys Salt Lake oval for post-retirement innings

	Sourav Ganguly has finally found a playground of his choice to pad up again  CA 222, Sector I, Salt Lake.        
	The urban development department has leased out this oval-shaped, 62-cottah plot to him for 999 years to build an integrated school from primary to higher secondary level.        
	Sourav formally took possession of the plot on February 17 after depositing a provisional fee of Rs 13,70,500. Bidhannagar Municipality hasnt received the construction plan yet but the buzz about the Behala boys Salt Lake base is growing. I have been told that he has inspected the area several times. I would like to meet him and discuss his plans, said Ila Roy, the councillor of Ward 1. There are two schools in the neighbourhood (Hariyana Vidya Mandir and Salt Lake School) already, leading to traffic congestion. We need to take steps to tackle the problem after a discussion with him, she added.        
	The 48.295-cottah plot originally allotted to Sourav  BF 158 in Sector I  turned out to be too small for the man known to clear large boundaries with ease.

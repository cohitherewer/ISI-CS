The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Seniors, just dont get physical
                                                                                                                 We Ask You Answer      Seniors, just dont get physical
          Todays question: Should the college authorities go soft on ragging?                    Students of Jadavpur University protest a decision to suspend a student for a semester for ragging a fresher. A Telegraph picture

	Ragging is a crime in disguise that should be rooted out of the education system. It seems the pain and suffering of others give some students a high. Seniors should help their juniors. But ragging shatters the confidence of juniors, which even leads some to commit suicide. Where is our nation heading to with youths who have no compassion and mercy for their fellow beings?                Santosh Chakravarty, 
  Unique Park								       
	Ragging has become a perversion, a disease. The sinners should be awarded exemplary punishment. The culprits should be suspected for five years at least.

	Ragging is a sort of perversion. It is sadistic pleasure derived by causing deliberate pain  physical, psychological or otherwise  to youngsters, in the name of bringing them closer to their seniors. The institutions must handle this menace properly. During our freshers welcome at Ramakrishna Mission Shilpamandira, Belur Math, each of us were introduced separately to our seniors and presented with a box of sweets and flowers. All juniors were helped and guided throughout the first year by the seniors. I wonder why this cannot be emulated by others.                Debalina Chowdhury, 
  Garia								       
	Ragging may hamper life in a college. In most cases, the victims are too scared to speak of the abuse they have faced. As a result, nervous breakdowns and cases of suicide are becoming common. A college should have interactive sessions which drive home the point that students guilty of ragging are to be condemned. Posters banning ragging should be put up on the premises and most importantly, students should be encouraged to speak up. A healthy relationship between the faculty and students is necessary. Ragging is a punishable offence and college authorities should take stringent action against the accused.                 Manimay Paul, 
  Habra								       
	Ragging is a brutal practice that has been going on for years. The government and college authorities should give exemplary punishment to the accused and save students.                Richik Majumdar, 
  Sodepur								       
	Authorities should tolerate ragging up to a certain level and should impose strict restrictions beyond that. Ragging cannot be stopped altogether, however hard one tries. Sometimes the authorities dont take any steps for fear of ruining the reputation of the institution. This should be stopped and harassed students should feel free to report their problems to the authorities.                 Debraj Bhowmick,

	Being a lecturer in an engineering college, my suggestion is that seniors can rag newcomers without any physical harassment or vulgar comments but with a sense of testing their intelligence. Ragging should not cross limits. Mild ragging helps creativity and allows juniors to respect teachers and seniors. It also helps one learn how to communicate with strangers and how to tackle a problem.                 Diptajit Basak, 
  Address not mentioned								       
	A great man once said that if boys and girls do not learn discipline in the school days, money and time spent on their education is a national waste. It is obvious that those who commit ragging are blazing examples of how base and low our morality has become these days. Raggers obtain a sadistic pleasure from inflicting pain on innocent people. Students who have been ragged bear a grudge against the treatment and in turn rag their own juniors. Until the attitude of eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth changes, this problem is unlikely to stop.                 Somdyuti Chakraborty,
  Dhakuria								       
	It has always been said that ragging creates a bond between seniors and freshers. So ragging is quiet healthy. But now ragging has turned out to be a torture for juniors, sometimes causing death. College authorities should undertake stern action against those accused of ragging. They should make conscious attempts to educate students on the unhappy consequences of ragging so that they do not rag their juniors.                Jhum, 
  Dankuni								       
	Colleges need to punish students who rag and maintain a guideline for ragging. Offenders should be punished strictly so that the next batch thinks twice before behaving in a similar manner. Intellectual ragging should be accepted as it helps build a platform for friendship. Introvert students need ragging to make them come out of their shells.                Atif Ayaz, 
  Serampore, Hooghly								       
	Ragging, if done with good intentions, helps newcomers interact with their seniors. But at present, ragging has taken an ugly turn. Its alarming to know that most seniors rag in a drunken state. Raggers must be punished in the harshest possible way, irrespective of their political affiliation or family status.

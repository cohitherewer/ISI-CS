The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Letter to poll panel for green campaign
                                                                                                               Letter to poll panel for green campaign
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Environment activist Subhash Dutta has written to the chief election commissioner, urging him to ask parties to abide by green norms during the campaign.        
	Dutta said that unless green norms were followed, the polls would leave in their wake around 1 lakh metric tonnes of non-biodegradable waste that would add to the pollution.        
	The waste would include plastic or vinyl flags, festoons and posters. The activist has urged the poll panel to announce an embargo on the use of such material in the election process.        
	The state environment department, while admitting in private that plastic waste is not properly disposed of after elections, has refrained from issuing any directive citing lack of legal provisions.        
	In West Bengal, there are certain environment norms, including those on noise pollution, that parties and candidates are required to abide by during election campaign, especially when they coincide with major exams, said Biswajit Mukherjee, the chief law officer of the environment department.        
	During the Assembly elections in 2006, the authorities had appealed to the candidates not to use plastic banners as far as possible. The plea, an official added, was mostly met with a favourable response.        
	With the campaign against wall graffiti becoming stronger by the day, officials fear any such appeal will go unheeded this time.        
	Some political leaders, however, have expressed the willingness to follow green norms and avoid graffiti.        
	There will be no wall graffiti in our ward and the plastic banners we will use will be properly disposed of immediately after the elections, said Debasish Kumar, the councillor of ward 85. The elected representatives of a few other south Calcutta wards, too, have made similar commitments.        
	City-based environment activists said parties mostly paid lip service to the green cause and implemented the norms according to their convenience.        
	But with public pressure mounting and NGOs prodding parties to take up the green issue, leaders can no longer ignore or discard green agendas, said an activist.

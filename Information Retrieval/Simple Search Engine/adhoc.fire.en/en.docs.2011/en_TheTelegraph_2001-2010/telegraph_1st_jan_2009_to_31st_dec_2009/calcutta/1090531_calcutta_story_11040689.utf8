      Lock away the plates

	The earliest legal documents in India, the records of grants by kings, were engraved on copper plates with regal seal and preserved in secret vaults. Their value as antiques having vaulted manifold, collectors are whisking away the plates before historians and epigraphists can catch a glimpse.     
	On the other hand are Indian institutions that are apathetic to the loss or destruction of the plates in their collection, feels epigraphist Suresh Chandra Bhattacharya. He was delivering the 15th Adhir Chakravarti Memorial Lecture at the Centre for Archaeological Studies and Training on Camac Street recently.     
	With the Pala dynasty, the absence of any written history (except the Ramcharita) makes such inscriptions the biggest source of information. The copper plates not only carry the name and lineage of the person making the grant but the executors, the witnesses and three generations of beneficiaries. There are verses celebrating the deeds of all the rulers, their wives, chief officials, descriptions of cities and major monuments. And yet, laments Bhattacharya, several valuable plates from the collections of the Asiatic Society and the Indian Museum are missing or destroyed. Careless storage and unchecked corrosion have taken their toll on a Pala copper plate from Murshidabad that has been at the Indian Museum for over 18 years.     
	The Asiatic Society keeps everything under lock and key so that the lapses are not found out, Bhattacharya says.     
	I had trouble gaining permission though I am a permanent member. Then I was told the key to the store was lost. When that was found, they said the key to the cabinet where the plate was kept couldnt be traced. The facilities available are equally discouraging. I had to strain my eyes to read the inscriptions in the dim light, he recalled.     
	In the 1970s, Bhattacharya had been asked by the Asiatic Society to draw up a list of all the copper plates in its collection. Comparing the items with an earlier list made by Rakhaldas Bandyopadhyay, I realised the Sogaura plate had disappeared and the label was stuck on a much newer plate. The Sogaura plate is the oldest metal inscription in the country, probably from before the Ashokan era. Also untraceable was the Asrafpur Copper Plate of Deva Kharga, whose photograph exists in the Societys journal. Many valuable plates are smuggled away to be sold abroad.     
	Bhattacharya says inscriptions need to be repeatedly interpreted in the light of new discoveries. Researchers should be allowed to access inscriptions easily and be given the assurance that they are preserved carefully.

	As Calcutta reeled under the Aila effect, Ranvir S. Sabharwal was empowered by the realisation that someone up there is protecting me.        
	How else could I have survived this? he asked on Tuesday, pointing to the smashed bonnet and windshield of his Maruti Zen.        
	Real estate developer Sabharwal, 57, was returning from his Gariahat office to his bungalow at 21B Belvedere Road, when a tree came crashing down on the bonnet of his car near Command Hospital in Alipore.        
	Sabharwal, who was at the wheel, and his driver  seated next to him  survived without a scratch.My turban saved me from a serious head injury, said Sabharwal, who has had two previous close shaves in a car. Once a boulder fell on my car and on another occasion, I was caught in a landslide. But Monday was my closest brush with death, said the businessman.        
	The Zen will go to a workshop soon and return as new but the scars in Sabharwals mind will take time to heal. I wont forget this incident in a hurry, he said.        
	If Sabharwal had someone up there to thank for saving his life, Amitava Roy was left criticising the Calcutta Municipal Corporation after more than 24 hours of being holed up in a house with a huge, partially uprooted tree leaning precariously against the first and second-floor balconies.        
	We have been calling up the corporation to remove the tree but to no avail, said Roy, a professor of English at Rabindra Bharati University.                          
	Roy, who lives with his wife in his ancestral three-storeyed house on Maharaja Nanda Kumar Road  off Southern Avenue  had decided not to venture out on Monday after hearing about the cyclone warning. Little did they know that the Aila effect would come knocking on their door.        
	I was sitting in my bedroom reading an SMS from my daughter about the cyclone when I heard something crash with a bang  almost like a bomb blast, followed by the sound of glass being shattered. Then I saw the branch of a tree that had smashed through the door between the balcony and the bedroom, said Roys wife Shreela, a former head of the history department at Loreto College.        
	As the storm continued to rage, Roy tried to contact every agency he thought could help. I called the fire brigade but they said it was not their job and asked us to contact the police or the corporation. I called the police, who said we needed to call the corporation. The corporation official told us they there were many uprooted trees across the city and not enough people to remove them, he said.        
	By evening, the Roys had hired a couple of workers to chop off the branches that had jammed their first-floor balcony and the main gate of 6A Maharaja Nanda Kumar Road.        
	The couple spent a sleepless night and were up early to cope with natures fury and administrative apathy.

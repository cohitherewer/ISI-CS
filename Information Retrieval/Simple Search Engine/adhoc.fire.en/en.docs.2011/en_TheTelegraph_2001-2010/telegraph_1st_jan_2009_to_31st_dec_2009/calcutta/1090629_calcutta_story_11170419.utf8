The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Moonwalk amp; memories   I was all out on MJ
                                                                                                               Moonwalk amp; memories   I was all out on MJ
  - Two Calcuttans are in mourning  one who would dress like Jackson, the other who would have danced with Jackson           PRATIM D. GUPTA                                                      
	As he sits behind the octopad every evening at Trincas on Park Street in a shirt and tie, there is nothing in the slightly plump face of the schoolteacher-cum-musician to suggest that Nigel Gomez used to be the Smooth Criminal.        
	But ask any musician whos been around and hes sure to remember him, not as Nigel Gomez, but as Calcuttas Michael Jackson who would dress up like the King of Pop and hit every club and concert in town.        
	I never thought Michael Jackson could die, sighs Nigel. My sister called early on Friday to give me the news.... I couldnt accept that he could go just like that. To burn out like a shooting star... I was depressed the whole day. In the evening, at Trincas, I dedicated a couple of his songs to him, like Billie Jean and We Are The World.        
	Nigels tryst with Jackson dates back to the mid-1980s. I was about 10 or 11 when I saw the video of Thriller at my uncles place, recalls the 36-year-old whose daytime job is as a primary section teacher at Loyola High School, Kidderpore. His movements were so different. I immediately started trying to do sequences like him. First at home, then at school and soon I was moonwalking at the clubs and all. I went on to become a professional dancer and choreographer                  Nigel Gomez      
	Almost every night, Nigel would become Jackson. I used to dress up exactly like him. There was this white suit and hat he wore for the Smooth Criminal song in his film Moonwalker (1988). I tailored it to the tee for a dance bash in Dalhousie Institute and wore the three-quarter pants. The half-black half-white shoes were also specially ordered. Everyone at the club was really spooked out. The other outfit I used to wear was the one MJ wore in the The Way You Make Me Feel video  blue shirt, with a white T-shirt inside, and black trousers, white socks, black shoes, black hat.                                
	From DI to CCFC, RCGC to Pink Elephant, Nigel was the rage as MJ. When I used to take the dance floor everyone would sit down because they couldnt handle the way I danced.... I also used to keep my hair long and plait it, so that it would turn curly and frizzy.... I was all out on MJ.        
	Nigel is in mourning but that hasnt muzzled his music. Sitting in his semi-formals at Trincas, he says: I dont dress like him because I have gained weight and no one wants to look at a fat Michael Jackson!        
	But some things never change. I can still moonwalk the same way as I used to 20 years back.

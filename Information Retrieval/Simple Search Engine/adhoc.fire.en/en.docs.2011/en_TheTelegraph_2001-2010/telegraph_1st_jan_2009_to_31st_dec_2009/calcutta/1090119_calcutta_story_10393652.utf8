The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Civic body rally curbs unite trade unions 
                                                                                                               Civic body rally curbs unite trade unions 
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                              
	The circular banning the employees in the civic headquarters from holding rallies, sloganeering and submitting lists of demand before the authorities beyond the 30-minute tiffin break has brought bickering trade unions together.        
	The circular, issued last week by municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay, bans squatting inside the headquarters altogether and makes it mandatory for trade union representatives to seek an appointment to submit a charter of demands to the mayor or the municipal commissioner.        
	Trinamul trade union leader Sovandeb Chattopadhyay and Badal Kar of Calcutta Municipal Corporation Workmens Union described the curbs as encroachment on workers rights.         
	The state vice-president of the Citu-run Security and Co-workmens Union, Amalendu Bhattacharya, who is also a special officer in civic information and public relations department, echoed them.         
	The CPM-led board has started gagging the trade unions. It is another manifestation of their autocracy. If the circular is not withdrawn we will stage a dharna in the courtyard of the civic headquarters, said a spokesperson of the BJP-run Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh.        
	Most of those who have started working in the civic headquarters in the past five years feel that the curbs are justified, especially since activities of the unions are largely limited to soliciting transfer of members to departments of their choice..        
	Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said: The circular is not encroaching on the rights and privileges of the civic employees. Rather, it reaffirms the rights of the trade unions. Indiscipline cannot be anyones right.         
	He added: How can I accept a charter of demands from a group of employees in the middle of a meeting with delegates from abroad? Does it look good if 20 people stand outside my door to submit a list of demands? They must seek an appointment first.        
	There are 14 trade unions for over 33,000 civic employees. Only six unions can negotiate with the authorities.

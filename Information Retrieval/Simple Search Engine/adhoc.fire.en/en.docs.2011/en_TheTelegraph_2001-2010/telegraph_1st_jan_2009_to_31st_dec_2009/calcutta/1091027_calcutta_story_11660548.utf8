The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Eviction eyewash on street
                                                                                                               Eviction eyewash on street
          OUR BUREAU                          A pavement on KK Tagore Street under Posta police station taken over by hawkers                                  
	Cops and hawkers play out a charade of crime and punishment on the pavements of Calcutta every day with a happy ending for everyone except the pedestrian.         
	On an average, the 48 police stations in the city register around 100 cases pertaining to unauthorised occupation of pavements and carriageways. But at the end of the day, the hawkers remain where pedestrians are meant to walk, the police pat themselves for a sham well enacted, and the government laughs all the way to the exchequer.        
	Hawkers contribute around Rs 72 lakh a month to the state. In return, they are assured of business security at the cost of the pedestrians right. We are a part of this game because that is how the administration wants it to be, said a traffic police sergeant.        
	The script is the same for every police station. A police van sets out on the designated day and time to evict hawkers from the pavement or pathway in a particular area but nobody is actually rounded up.         
	Official records show that hawkers are taken to the police station and challans issued against their names. The police even draw up a fake list of items seized from them. In reality, no hawker has to leave his stall even for two minutes, said a member of the central hawkers union.        
	The official fine is Rs 50 but arrested hawkers often pay double the amount so that they arent disturbed during business hours. Once the cops send the relevant documents to the court, the hawkers get bail.        
	Sources said the maximum number of false cases against hawkers were being registered at the police stations in Burrabazar, Posta, New Market and Bhowanipore.        
	But what forces the police to resort to this arrest drama? The police need to follow court orders as well as keep the hawkers happy. Hawkers are a very strong political lobby. If you try to remove them forcibly, they will turn violent, said a senior traffic police officer.        
	According to the Hawker Sangram Committee, close to 3 lakh hawkers do business worth Rs 9,000 crore annually on the streets of the city. They neither pay taxes nor do they foot any electricity bill.         
	Activist Subhash Dutta, who had filed a writ petition in 2002 seeking a high court order for the removal of hawkers from pavements and thoroughfares, said political patronage had made the hawker lobby immune to even judicial intervention.        
	Hawkers constitute a vote bank as well as a cadre base for political parties. No party will act against them, said Dutta.         
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation Act specifies that hawkers can occupy two-third of a pavement but not within 50 yards of a crossing. Hawkers are also required to wrap up by 6pm in office areas.        
	The high court on Friday gave the government a fortnight to submit a status report on the encroachment of pavements by hawkers along eight thoroughfares in north and central Calcutta.

                                                                                                               Hospital fracas after boy death
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Relatives of a two-and-a-half-year-old boy who died at RG Kar hospital on Friday afternoon accused the doctors of negligence, tried to prevent the body from being sent for post-mortem and allegedly broke hospital furniture.        
	Aditya Ghosh accidentally consumed mosquito repellent in his Patipukur house on Friday morning. His father Dilip rushed him to RG Kar hospital, where he was admitted to the paediatric ward around 8.30am.        
	The boy died around 12.30pm.        
	The boys family members said in their complaint that the doctors did not treat him properly. The relatives broke chairs while the body was being taken for post-mortem, said an officer of Tallah police station.        
	About 30 people later put up a blockade in front of the hospital for half an hour, disrupting traffic.        
	Utpal Dutta, the principal of RG Kar, said: The boy died of poisoning despite the best efforts of doctors. The family was not willing to send the body for post-mortem and created trouble.

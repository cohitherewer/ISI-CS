The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Goons beat up cops, traders
                                                                                                               Goons beat up cops, traders
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Four armed extortionists beat up two plainclothesmen and some shop-owners near Howrah station on Tuesday afternoon before a contingent from Golabari police station overpowered them. Two of the goons were arrested.         
	Police said the extortionists, all in their 30s and residents of Howrah, raided a dhaba near the Howrah station minibus stand and demanded money from owner Manoj Sonkar.         
	When Sonkar refused to pay up, one of the gang members, Sheikh Kajal, whipped out a pistol and held it to the traders head.         
	The exchange between Sonkar and the extortionists attracted the attention of other shopkeepers and pedestrians. When Kajal brought out the gun, they raised an alarm prompting the plainclothesmen to reach the spot.         
	Realising that a crowd was gathering, the four tried to run away. They beat up the cops and some traders who tried to stop them.        
	Sheikh Kajal and Sheikh Bachha escaped. Sheikh Lakshmi and Sheikh Haddi were arrested. They will be produced in court on Wednesday, said an officer.         
	Extortionists have become a menace in the area but I am determined not to pay them, said Sonkar.        
	Extortion has become a regular affair in the area. Unless the cops tighten vigil, it is difficult for us to run our business here, said another shop owner.        
	Demonstration: Around 100 Group D contractual workers of RG Kar and NRS hospitals went on a two-hour ceasework on Tuesday demanding salary and bonus on a par with permanent employees. The superintendents of both hospitals said the agitating employees had not submitted a charter of demands.

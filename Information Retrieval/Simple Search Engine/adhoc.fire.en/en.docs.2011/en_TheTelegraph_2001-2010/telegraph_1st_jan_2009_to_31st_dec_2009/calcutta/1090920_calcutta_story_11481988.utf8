The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Epic guide to goodness
                                                                                                               Epic guide to goodness

	Mahabharata shows us how difficult it is to be good, said Das, who was in the city for the launch of the book published by Penguin at ICCR recently. Das, CEO-turned-writer, took an academic holiday to study the Indian epic. He strives to seek a contemporary relevance of the Mahabharata.         
	For Das, Yudhishthira and his swadharma are the actual heroes of Mahabharata. Mothers dont like to name their children after Yudhishthira. They would rather call them Arjuna for he is a winner. But Yudhishthira would not be a winner at all and there lies his greatness.         
	So who is Indias Yudhishthira in the 21st century? Das would like to believe its Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. He has Yudhishthira-like qualities, says Das. But adds: We need a PM with the qualities of Arjuna. A king has to be firm, he says, he has to follow the Dandaniti. But Manmohan is hardly that.         
	Take his role of silence in the selection of the President. When Pratibha Patil was picked to follow a man of such stature as Abdul Kalam, he chose to remain silent. The Mahabharata, he said, is concerned about the policy of silence. In the Sabha Parva, it says one-fourth of the blame lies with the silent witness.         
	Mahabharata, said Das, is close to our lives and shows the darkest sides of human character. It also acknowledges human endeavour.         
	In Islamic and Christian traditions, God is ultimate but in Mahabharata, human effort matters, he said. It doesnt say that there is no God, said Das, but it is a violent and dark epic. Yet it leaves us with hope.         
	Everlasting music        
	The split level at Oxford Bookstore filled up with the strains of sarod, santoor, guitar and the tabla. An orchestra of young musicians led by Shiraz Ali Khan, great-grandson of Ustad Alauddin Khan, was paying his tribute to the legendary musician. The occasion was the launch of Boro Baba  Ustad Alauddin Khan, a memoir of the legend written by Khan sahibs eldest great-granddaughter Sahana Gupta and published by Roli Books.         
	Alauddin Khans grandson Aashish Khan released the book, which tells the story of a man who sought oneness with God through his music. Sahana sifts through Babas handwritten manuscript, photographs and letters to construct his life through the time when he survived on alms to learn music, to his becoming the master.         
	Documentary history         
	B.D. Gargas painstaking documentation of the history of documentary films in India, From Raj to Swaraj: The Non-Fiction Film in India, published by Penguin Books has won the Swarn Kamal at the National Awards for Best Book on Cinema for the year 2007. The Swarn Kamal (Golden Lotus) award will be shared by Garga and his publisher Penguin Books India.         
	This is Penguins fifth winner at the awards. From Raj to Swaraj is the first book that gives a full history of documentary films in India made from 1896 to the 1970s, said Udayan Mitra, executive editor, Penguin Books India.         
	Garga is a renowned film archivist, who was a documentary film-maker, said Mitra. From Raj to Swaraj traces the history of documentary films made in India before and after the Independence.

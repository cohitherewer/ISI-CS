The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Roads turn parking lot
                                                                                                               Roads turn parking lot
  - Rally Vehicles on the greens          A STAFF REPORTER                            Rallyists vehicles parked on the Maidan (top) and in triple lane on CR Avenue. Pictures by Sanat Kumar Sinha                                       
	Police looked the other way as Left Front supporters made a mockery of parking rules in the heart of the city on Monday.         
	Trucks and buses that ferried comrades from the districts to the rally to commemorate the food movement were parked in double and triple lanes along both pavements of CR Avenue, restricting other vehicles to a narrow channel on each flank.        
	In the afternoon, the trucks and buses kept moving towards Metro Channel, the rally venue, despite cops and party volunteers making announcements asking the drivers to not proceed south beyond Central Metro station.                  
	We have more important work to do than book vehicles for parking rule violation. Our primary focus for the day is crowd management and maintaining a steady flow of vehicles, said a traffic sergeant posted at the Colootolla Street crossing, where Matadors were parked side by side creating a bottleneck for buses.        
	The rallyists were unapologetic about the traffic chaos they were causing. So many vehicles have arrived from different parts of the state. Where would we park our vehicles? We cannot keep our vehicles miles away from the venue and walk, said Mohammed Noor, a rallyist from Serampore.        
	Not just the roads but also the Maidan bore the brunt of illegal parking. Large buses were stationed on the greens near Victoria Memorial, Park Street and Red Road and opposite Eden Gardens.        
	Several parts of the Maidan were mauled by the tyres of the buses and trucks.        
	Metro spotted rallyists littering the greens around the spots where their vehicles were parked.         
	Parking so many vehicles in front of Victoria Memorial and on Ronald Ross Sarani is a gross violation of a high court order. The court had prohibited such parking on and around the Maidan and had even asked the police to record such violations on video. The cops did not take any such initiative on Monday. I would bring this to the notice of the court, said Subhas Dutta, an environment activist.        
	With the rallyists vehicles blocking the roads, commuters had no option but to travel by Metro Railway.        
	The passenger count was much higher than last Mondays 5.33 lakh, said a senior official of Metro Railway.        
	With fewer buses on the road, the ferry service also recorded a rise in passenger footfall compared with other weekdays.

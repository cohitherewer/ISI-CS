The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Toll rises by two
                                                                                                               Toll rises by two
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two more men fell victim to hooch in Hooghly Jute Mill Colony in the port area on Tuesday, taking the toll to 27.         
	The latest victims were Dilip and Debu Mallik.        
	A team comprising cops and excise officials on Tuesday raided illicit liquor dens in the North and South Port and Eastern Suburban divisions.         
	Around 1,500 litres of illicit liquor have been seized and 37 people arrested.        
	The raids, now confined to the city, will be extended to the districts, said home secretary Ardhendu Sen. The government, he added, would produce pilferage-proof bottles to stop production of illicit liquor.        
	A section of residents of ward 15 of Bidhannagar Municipality destroyed five hooch dens near tank No. 15. While the outlets were being smashed, a few cops from Bidhannagar (East) police station stood guard to maintain law and order.

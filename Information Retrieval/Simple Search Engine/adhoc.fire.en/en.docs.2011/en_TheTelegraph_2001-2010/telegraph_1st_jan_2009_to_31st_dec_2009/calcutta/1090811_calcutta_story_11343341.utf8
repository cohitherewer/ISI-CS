                                                                                                               Varsity suspends PhD admission
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Calcutta University                                  
	Calcutta University suspended the enrolment of PhD applicants on Monday after the University Grants Commission made it clear that stricter entry norms would have to be effective from the date they were announced last month.        
	Students had rushed to enrol for doctoral programmes at the university before entrance tests and the other new norms became mandatory.         
	A source in the university said the registration of about 80 doctoral students who enrolled after July 11, when the UGC issued a gazette notification announcing the norms, might be cancelled.         
	The CU authorities continued to admit PhD candidates under old norms till last week.The July 11 gazette notification implies that registrations of students enrolled under previous norms after that date are invalid, a source in the university said.        
	Pro vice-chancellor (academic) Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee said the university had not stopped admitting students on the basis of the existing rules as the UGC had not informed them when the new regulations would come into effect.         
	We will soon get in touch with the UGC authorities to find out what we should do with the students who have been enrolled for PhD after July 11, he added.         
	The notice on Monday states that the registration of students who applied for doctoral programmes between July 11 and August 8 would be kept on hold.        
	We have completed the formalities for enrolling in a PhD programme. We have also paid registration fees of Rs 500. The authorities should have consulted the UGC before allowing us to register for doctoral programmes, said an affected student.         
	According to the revised regulations, after admission, PhD students will have to attend classes on their area of research before starting work on their thesis.

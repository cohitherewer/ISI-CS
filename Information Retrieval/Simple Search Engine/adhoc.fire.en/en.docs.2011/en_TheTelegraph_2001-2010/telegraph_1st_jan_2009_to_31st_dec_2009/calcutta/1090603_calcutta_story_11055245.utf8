The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Team for safe, clear roads
                                                                                                               Team for safe, clear roads
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The civil defence department plans to remove uprooted trees, hanging concrete chunks and dangling electrical wires as a pre-emptive measure this monsoon, drawing lessons from the Aila effect.        
	Starting next week, a 20-member team would work round-the-clock in three shifts in the city during the rainy season to prevent mishaps and disruptions, said civil defence minister Srikumar Mukherjee.        
	The team members will be provided electric saws and ladders and trained for the job. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation will provide them food and accommodation.         
	The minister recently met municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay at Writers Buildings to work out the plan.         
	Every monsoon, uprooted trees block the roads and hanging concrete chunks and live wires pose threat to pedestrians. Our men are adept at dealing with these problems, said Mukherjee.        
	Bandyopadhyay said the civic body lacks the expertise and gadgets to tackle such problems. But the civil defence personnel have both the equipment and training for the job. So we have accepted their proposal, he added.        
	According to him, the civic body will also train its employees and procure equipment so that it is better prepared to deal with challenges like those posed by Aila.

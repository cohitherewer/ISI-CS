The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tech varsity sets up review panel
                                                                                                               Tech varsity sets up review panel
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The West Bengal University of Technology on Friday set up a review committee following demonstration by several students who had scored low marks in the odd semester (first in an academic year).        
	The panel, comprising college principals and directors of the university, will try to identify the reason for the poor results, said vice-chancellor Sabyasachi Sen Gupta. It will also suggest ways to give some relief to the students.        
	The panels report will be submitted to the VC who will present it before the academic council. The VC admitted that the university and the colleges did not have enough teachers. Any other loophole that we come across will be plugged. I also urge guardians to ensure that their wards attend classes regularly, Sen Gupta said.        
	Around 300 students backed by the SFI gathered outside the Salt Lake campus of the university  the affiliating body of all private technical colleges in the state  around 1pm and demonstrated till 3.15pm. A team later met the VC.        
	The VC told us that a review committee would be set up and admitted that the results were unexpected, said Subhasish Dan, a final-year student of the Calcutta Institute of Pharmaceutical Technology.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pizza store camera catches thief in act
                                                                                                               Pizza store camera catches thief in act
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The entrance of 22 Camac Street                                  
	A man was arrested on Monday after closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage at the 22 Camac Street outlet of a pizza chain showed his wife stealing a patrons bag.        
	Police said Vilayat Hossain, in his mid-30s, was held as he had sold valuables lifted by his wife Archana from other prominent city stores.        
	Archana is a known jewellery thief. This time, she stole a bag, said city detective chief Jawed Shamim.        
	The victim visited the outlet with her family members on Friday and kept her bag, containing money and credit and debit cards, on an empty chair beside her seat. When she could not find the bag after some time, she lodged a complaint with the police.        
	We went to the shop and studied the CCTV footage. Archana followed the victim while pretending to talk on her cellphone. She lifted the bag soon after the complainant kept it on the chair, added Shamim. The investigators returned to Lalbazar with a picture of Archana and found that her particulars were already on the police record.         
	A team raided Archanas house at Deganga, North 24-Parganas, on Monday morning.        
	She was not at home. We rounded up Vilayat as he was involved in his wifes criminal activities. His job was to sell the stolen items, said an officer.        
	Elaborating on Archanas modus operandi, Shamim said: She operates in shopping malls, food courts and jewellery shops. She dresses well and enters stores with a cellphone in hand, pretending to be a customer. She scans an outlet for shoppers who are unmindful of their bags and springs into action as soon as she finds one.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Power cuts in exam month
                                                                                                               Power cuts in exam month
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Power cuts are back to haunt examinees as the governments promise of uninterrupted supply of electricity during the ongoing Madhyamik and other board exams has fallen flat.        
	The combined shortfall in Calcutta and the districts on Thursday evening rose to 450MW. The deficit in the CESC-served areas was 100MW. In Calcutta, power cuts ranged from at least 60 to 90 minutes. In the districts, power cuts ranged from three to four hours.        
	Power department officials blamed it on a number of units shutting down over the past few days following snags and the growing demand with rising temperatures.        
	We were helpless as a number of units had to be shut down. We are trying to manage with power cuts by rotation, said power minister Mrinal Banerjee.        
	The rotational power cut formula has frustrated the likes of ISC examinee Atreyee Bhattacharya. There are regular power cuts in our area, affecting preparations and even the exams. The power went off in the exam hall for a while, said the student of Our Lady Queen of the Missions School and a resident of Kasba.        
	Kiran Kumar Ghosh, a student of Birla High School appearing for his CBSE, has been hit hard by the power cut in exam time. We had a three-hour exam and there was a power cut for an hour, making it very hot and humid, said Kiran. I found it very difficult to concentrate and my writing speed was also hampered.        
	The Madhyamik exams started from February 24 while the ICSE, ISC and CBSE exams started from March 2. The Higher Secondary exams are scheduled to begin on March 16.        
	In view of the exams, we tried to purchase power from some states but it was not available. We are now trying to get about 200MW of power from Punjab but it is yet to be confirmed, said the power minister.        
	Moloy Dey, the chairman of the West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Limited, said the situation is likely to improve from Friday evening when two power units are brought back on stream.        
	Met officials, however, held out no hope of Celsius relief. The maximum temperature now is four degrees above normal. There is incursion of moisture from the Bay of Bengal because of a trough of low pressure. We dont foresee any respite from the warm spell soon, said G.C. Debnath of the Alipore met office.

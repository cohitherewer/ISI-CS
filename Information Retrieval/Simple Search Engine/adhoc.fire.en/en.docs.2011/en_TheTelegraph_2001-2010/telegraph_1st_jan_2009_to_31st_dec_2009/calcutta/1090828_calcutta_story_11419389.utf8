                      Art of naturalism                    Perhaps the most versatile artist of Bengal, Bikash Bhattacharjee expressed a spontaneous humanity through his art and showed his contemporaries how modern, realistic visual expressions could also evoke warm and sensitive feelings. Depicting the aspirations and penetrating the psychological undercurrents of common people also made his works powerfully relevant to his time. He excelled in all possible mediums including oil, watercolour, gouache, pastel and even traditional methods of printmaking. Inspired by great masters of European Renaissance from Rembrandt to Degas, he created painted poetry, but with a raw naturalism or photo-realism, which was his special forte. He also had the rare ability to create an authentic milieu as a background to his characters, heightening the drama of his compositions. Art-lovers of the city now have yet another opportunity to view his works at the ongoing retrospective show of the late master. Hosted by Emami Chisel Art to mark his 69th birthday, celebrated on June 21, it showcases 69 of Bhattacharjees paintings and was conceived through intense research carried out for a period of two years. Another engaging aspect of the show are three personal pieces by the artists close friends, Manasij Majumdar, Pranabranjan Ray and Sanat Kar, that explain his craft and offer valuable insight into the mind of certainly one of Indias most respected contemporary masters.

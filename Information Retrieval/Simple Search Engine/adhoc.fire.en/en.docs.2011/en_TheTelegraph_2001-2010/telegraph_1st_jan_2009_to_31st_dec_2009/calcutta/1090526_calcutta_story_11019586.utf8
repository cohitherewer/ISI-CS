The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | THE WINDLASH   Blow-by-blow account of Aila from the war room
                                                                                                               THE WINDLASH   Blow-by-blow account of Aila from the war room
          MEGHDEEP BHATTACHARYYA                                                  
	Monday was business as usual for officials at the Alipore Met office. The weathermen worked at their usual pace, finding time for the usual tea and cigarette breaks. The only difference? A lot more phone calls and a few more sheets to go through, said an official.        
	But what flashed on their monitors and came printed on their sheets throughout Monday was anything but usual  it took Calcutta by storm, and rain.        
	The city woke up to a dark, cloudy morning around 6am with lower-than-usual temperatures and higher-than-usual wind speed of 25-30kmph.        
	By 8am, the cloud cover had assumed ominous proportions and the wind speed had revved up to 40-50kmph. There were spells of moderate rain every 15 minutes or so.        
	About 300km south of the city over the Bay of Bengal, Aila was warming up to hit land, with wind speed of around 70-80kmph and a diameter of 250-350km.        
	By 10am, the sky was dark and the duration between spells of heavy rain had diminished to about two minutes. The wind let up a little, settling around the 40kmph mark. Aila had moved in a northerly direction and was within 250km of the city.        
	The lull was illusory; the storm was ready to strike. Mid-day brought relentless downpour. The wind hissed and howled at 80-90 kmph. Trees came crashing down and a trail of destruction cut through the city. Aila was just about 200km from the city.        
	Aila was about to make landfall near Sagar Island, 150km from the city, with a diameter of 350km and wind speed of more than 100kmph.        
	Aila made its landfall near Sagar Island around 2pm, with a wind speed of 120kmph, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	The storm in the city went on the rampage, with wind speed peaking at 100-110kmph. Frequent spells of very heavy rainfall accompanied the storm and the transport system was paralysed. Flights were cancelled and redirected.        
	By 4pm, moving in a northerly direction, Aila lashed South 24-Parganas, North 24-Parganas, East Midnapore and parts of Hooghly.        
	The closest Aila came to Calcutta was around 3.30pm  according to estimates it was around 15km southwest of the city.         
	By then, the storm had toned down to 70-80kmph, but the rainfall was heavy. No wonder the days maximum temperature stayed nine degrees below normal at 26.9 degree Celsius.        
	At 6pm, Calcutta could heave a sigh of relief. Aila is on the wane and moving in a northerly direction. The eye of the storm was 50km west of the city by evening, said Debnath.         
	Howrah and Hooghly were hit hard but the wind speed in Calcutta had dropped to 45-60kmph. The rainfall was in the nineties and counting.        
	By 8pm, a weakened Aila was headed for north Bengal. The windspeed settled to around 50-60kmph by 11pm, Debnath added.        
	At the end of an unusual day of business as usual, the weathermen admitted that Calcutta had rarely seen such wind and rain. Tuesday, they warned, would bring more rain but less wind.        
	There would be cloud cover with spells of heavy rain and thundershowers all through Tuesday. The residual impact of the cyclone in south Bengal is likely to continue for at least another 24 hours.

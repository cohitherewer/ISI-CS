The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Wanted: list of banned crackers
                                                                                                                 We Ask You Answer      Wanted: list of banned crackers
          Todays question: What spoilt your Diwali, the bursting of banned crackers or the cop crackdown?                                                      
	Sankhojit Chatterjee, 
  SP Mukherjee Road									      
	I was picked up on Diwali (October 17) at 5pm from SP Mukherjee Road by Tollygunge police and slapped with unknown charges. I was released at 2am. Throughout the evening, the police continued to book citizens without measuring the decibel levels of the firecrackers being burst. Neither were the cops equipped to do so. In most cases, after the citizens were booked, their crackers were seized but no seizure list was drawn up.                 A. Choudhury, 
  Mandeville Gardens								       
	We are a couple in our sixties, living in a highrise building in Ballygunge. We were surprised at the higher level of noise this Diwali but we must admit that we thoroughly enjoyed the lovely show of lights and even the sound of firecrackers from afar. I hope the authorities do not prevent people from enjoying this festival by imposing too many restrictions.           Harshvardhan Todi,

	This year, police arrested people even for bursting rockets that exploded in the sky. Why dont they release a list of permitted crackers? Also, how come people are not arrested for bursting chocolate bombs during Kali puja or Durga puja bhashans? What about the decibel level of loudspeakers at Durga puja pandals?                P.B. Saha, 
  Salt Lake								       
	The bursting of banned crackers spoilt my Diwali. That the policemen hesitated to nab the offenders in some cases doesnt bode well for the discipline of a metropolitan city. I fail to understand how a law that already exists and is made known to the public is flouted with such impunity.       
	My wife is a patient of hypertension and I had tympanoplasty some years back. Both of us suffered because of the loud noise. The true celebration of the festival of lights lies in quiet and devout worship of the Goddess. More than police action, a determined resistance by citizens will help contain this menace.                Sisir Das,
  Diamond Harbour Road								       
	Diwali was a nightmare for me. On October 17 evening, a policeman came to question the kids in our building about the fireworks they were lighting. I told him we had bought the crackers from Bazi Bazar, and if police had allowed these to be sold at a government-approved market, they should allow children to burst them too.      
	A police van arrived. I asked officers to supervise the fireworks that were being lighted. Suddenly one of the cops alleged that I had touched a police officer on duty and would have to go to the police station. These were false allegations, but I complied.       
	At the police station, they filed a case of beating up a policeman, tearing his uniform and injuring him against me. They also said I was drunk and took me to Ekbalpur nursing home. No one checked me with a breathalyser, but the cops obtained a certificate stating that I was drunk. The cops then slapped a non-bailable case against me that had no relation with bursting firecrackers. I was confined to the police station for 18 hours.       
	I am a neuro surgeon working with Peerless Hospital. There are 15 patients under my care and it is crucial that I be reachable 24x7. But my mobile phone was confiscated by the cops for 24 hours.                 Ashish,

	The cop crackdown spoilt our Diwali. It seems the chief minister, at whose behest the police harassed us, does not like non-Bengalis. Or else, how come he doesnt object to bursting of banned crackers during Bengali festivals?                Sanjay Dutta, 
  Robinson Road								       
	I was lighting fireworks with my family and other residents of our building on Robinson Road when a team led by the officer-in-charge of Shakespeare Sarani police station barged in, wielding batons. When I protested, they heckled me. They said we were bursting illegal crackers, a claim I disputed. I was forcibly taken to the police station along with two neighbours.       
	At the police station, I saw 60-70 people rounded up for the same crime. What was the administration doing when the so-called illegal crackers were being openly sold?                 B.K. Bagri, 
  Ishwar Ganguly Street								       
	Officers of Kalighat police station came to our building on Diwali evening and not finding any banned crackers on the terrace, they pointed to an empty packet of light- emitting crackers and said they were banned. We were asked to cooperate with the police and seven of us went with the cops to the police station.      
	ce we reached, the policemen said any two of us could stay behind to be arrested for bursting banned crackers and the rest could leave! Do Calcutta police, in their efforts to please their political masters, want citizens to volunteer as criminals? When we protested, all of us were sent to the lock-up. We were released at 2am. Our politicians should realise that police high-handedness can only result in the electorates ham-handedness in 2011.

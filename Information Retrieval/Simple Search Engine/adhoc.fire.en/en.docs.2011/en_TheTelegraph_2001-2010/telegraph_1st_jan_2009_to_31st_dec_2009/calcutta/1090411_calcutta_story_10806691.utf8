                      Stitched in time                    She creates the illusion that you can walk through her landscape and feel its weather. Her drawings, portraits and large and small landscape canvasses are deceptively quiet; their presence silently dominates the space around them. Nevertheless, the tone of Shreyasi Chatterjees work is fragile and precarious, uncertain and essentially contemplative. Through the Eye of a Needle, the ongoing show of her recent works, raises pertinent questions about the new consumer culture that is used to easy and mindless viewing. Through thoughtful reading, which her artwork requires, the artist and the viewer enter the painting to experience urban and rural spaces. On display are textile and mixed media collages that give references to the history of contemporary art, both Oriental and Western. Strong, mature and rooted to tradition, her works bear the influence of all-time greats including Abanindranath Tagore, Gaganendranath Tagore and Binode Behari Mukherjee, as well as Monet and Matisse. What is distinctive about Chatterjees works is the way in which she moves her references to contemporary times, renewing them with a sensitive, poetic visual language; at the same time, maintaining links between Bengals late Modernism and Indias 21st century.                    Event: An exhibition of recent art works by Shreyasi Chatterjee When: Till April 18 (except Sunday and public holidays); 2 pm - 7 pm, Monday, 3 pm - 7 pm Where: CIMA Gallery, Sunny Towers, 2nd floor, 43 Ashutosh Chowdhury Avenue

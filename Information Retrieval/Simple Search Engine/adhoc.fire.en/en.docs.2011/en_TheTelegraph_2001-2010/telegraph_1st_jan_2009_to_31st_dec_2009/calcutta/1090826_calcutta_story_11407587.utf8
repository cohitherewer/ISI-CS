The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bench to hear tech centre suit
                                                                                                               Bench to hear tech centre suit
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	A high court judge on Tuesday sent the case on the functioning of the 700-plus computer centres facilitated by the youth services department and run by private parties to the division bench headed by the chief justice.        
	This should be considered a public interest matter, said Justice Sanjib Banerjee. The division bench is expected to hear the case on September 28.        
	On August 7, Justice Banerjee shut down the centres for at least 15 days after observing that the private parties were selected without publishing advertisements.         
	The interim order had created pressure on 35,000 students, who had either enrolled or had obtained certificates from the centres, said the state lawyer.        
	On August 13, 18 of the centres had moved the bench against the order, claiming that they had not been heard by Justice Banerjee. Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar sent the matter to Justice Banerjee for disposal and ordered that the petitioners be added as parties to the case and the interim order would not apply to them.        
	Justice Banerjee later issued another order asking the computer centres to apply to be added as parties to the case.        
	Hundreds of centre owners have filed applications since then, said a court official.

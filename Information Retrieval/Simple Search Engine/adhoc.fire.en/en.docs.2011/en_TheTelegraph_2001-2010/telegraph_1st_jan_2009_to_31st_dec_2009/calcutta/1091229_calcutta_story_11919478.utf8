  - Aamir and Kiran to ring in 2010 in town with the Idiots          PRATIM D. GUPTA                          CALCUTTA CALLING: Aamir Khan at the Mumbai premiere of 3 Idiots with wife Kiran Rao                                        
	Guess whos coming to the New Years Eve party in town? Aamir Idiot Khan.        
	Two weeks after he landed up unannounced at Sourav Gangulys house, Aamir will be back with wife Kiran Rao  the Calcutta girl who could have been instrumental in the choice of the city for 31st night  on Thursday.        
	This time, he wont be stalking the bylanes of Behala in disguise. On the last day of the year, he will promote 3 Idiots as Aamir Khan superstar. It wont just be a daylong pitch for his only film of the year  which has already beaten Ghajinis first weekend record collections by around 30 per cent  as he will spend the last night of the year here.        
	His chosen party people for the midnight moment? Team 3 Idiots: Sharman Joshi, R. Madhavan, Rajkumar Hirani and Vidhu Vinod Chopra. No Kareena Kapoor, but Kiran Rao, the ex-student of Loreto House with whom Aamir completed four years of marriage on Monday.              
	Till now, Aamir hasnt made any party plans. It is meant to be a quiet dinner because they have an early morning flight to catch on Friday to Delhi, said a source.        
	On Thursday, Aamir will first visit a radio station and then Fame (South City) to interact with audiences watching 3 Idiots and talk about being Rancho.        
	Next stop, Paradise cinema, to attend a special screening of 3 Idiots for the army, organised by the GOC (Eastern Command) and the GOC (Bengal). When Aamir heard of the show, he agreed to be part of it straightaway. He will interact with the armymen, said Arun Mehra of Aum Moviez, the city distributor of 3 Idiots.        
	Finally, back to the star hotel for the year-end dinner with Kiran, the other Idiots and their families.

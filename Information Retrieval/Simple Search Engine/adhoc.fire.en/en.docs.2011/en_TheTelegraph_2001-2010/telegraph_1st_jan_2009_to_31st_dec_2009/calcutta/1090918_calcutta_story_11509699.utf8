          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The daughter of an inspector of the traffic police died on Thursday afternoon, falling victim to alleged reckless driving by her friend.        
	Priyanka Banik, 21, fell off the friends motorcycle, which was zigzagging down New Town Road at high speed, and was mowed down by a taxi, police said.        
	Priyanka, whose father Dilip Banik is an inspector in the traffic departments special raid section, was taken to a nursing home where she died a couple of hours later. Dipendu Ghosh, who was with Priyanka on the bike, suffered critical injuries.        
	The taxi sped off towards VIP Road after the mishap, said an officer of New Town police station.        
	Witnesses told the police that Ghosh was zigzagging down New Town Road at high speed towards Kaikhali around 1.30pm when the motorcycle skidded off loose stone chips at the Nababpur crossing.        
	As Priyanka fell on the road, a taxi from behind ran her over. It happened so fast that the taxi driver possibly did not get an opportunity to slam the brakes, said an officer of New Town police station.        
	Priyanka was alive but senseless when she was taken to the nursing home. She was immediately admitted to the intensive care unit where she died around 4.30pm. She was injured in her head, chest and other parts of her body, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters).        
	Actor warrant: The chief metropolitan magistrate on Thursday issued a bailable arrest warrant against actor Parambrata Chattopadhyay following a petition by Pramit Sen, husband of Swastika Mukherjee. The judge directed police to release Parambrata against a payment of Rs 300 as personal release bond.        
	CBI case: The CBI on Thursday started a case against four Damodar Valley Corporation officials for allegedly flouting tender norms to provide advantage to a Gujarat-based company. The tender had been floated for a coal handling plant in Purulia. A CBI official said it was Rs 245-crore scam.        
	Special train: Eastern Railway will run two pairs of special trains between Howrah and New Farakka on Friday and Saturday for Id.        
	Track disruption: Fourteen trains were disrupted in the Dum Dum Junction-Naihati section of Eastern Railways Sealdah division on Thursday because of a passengers protest against a delay in removing the body of a 60-year-old man run over by a train.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Wear your attitude
                                                                                                               Wear your attitude
										      Autumn Flush                        
	Senior citizens read newspapers more thoroughly than any other single group. They have the leisure and it is the medium they are still most familiar with while younger people catch up with news on the run.         
	We are also avid watchers of TV. Fashion pages and programmes with all their glamour, colour and drama, whos who among designers, which zero figure starlet dates the hunk of a model, and designs for clothes, office wear, weekend wear, accessories, handbags, even a whole page of laptop bags, are given a great deal of space. I enjoy reading this frivolous stuff myself but I have often wondered why none of this effort is directed at older people, particularly for elderly people confined to the bed or the wheelchair.        
	On a website www.silverline.com I found that in the US they make illness-specific clothes for every kind of sickness or disability, from simple night time cramps to Alzheimers and Parkinsons. I particularly appreciated the illustration of robes/ blouses/ tops in a back-to-front Jaipur type dress that folded over the full back of the patient and was then put together with Velcro. This is much better than the kaftan/nightie or hospital gown as either the elderly sick person or the care-giver can get it on with ease. They came in interesting solid colours. There are even (God help us!) hitech clothes that monitor blood pressure, blood sugar.        
	Bras for the older woman require a simple front fastening with a combination of buttons and Velcro. I hope t2s lingerie columnist is reading this and will begin a new line in designing for her.         
	Older gentlemen with rigid or trembling fingers need trousers or pajamas with few buttons or none and greater use of elastic and Velcro too. The drawstring becomes harder to use with advancing age and often ties itself into knots impossible to undo without help.        
	I long for a less cumbrous version of the sari too. It could surely become a readymade single garment complete with blouse and petticoat meant for the senior citizen. I have seen versions of it for the little girl who wishes to dress like her mother or more likely in the present scenario, like her grandmother.        
	I guess there is no simple answer to the question of what is appropriate wear for seniors. A dear doctor friend of mine looks svelte and beautiful at 70 and can and should wear anything she pleases. Another friend has at nearly 80 reinvented himself in denims and a rich silver pony tail. A male doctor friend loves red clothes and looks extremely elegant in them. I love their attitude.        
	Equally I dislike the expectations that women will wear mostly white after a certain age, the only concession being rich, uncomfortable zari borders which come as tattva gifts and during the Pujas. I myself go primarily for the comfort of cool cotton salwar kameezes in solid colours for daily wear since I retired. I wear nothing that is too tight or poky. I love the freedom this brings me.        
	With flat feet and heel spurs I have clothed my feet in comfortable sneakers for most of my life. It made the conductors screech to the drivers: Tham koisi! aamader zuita didi! (Stop! It is our didi with the sneakers!) on the Jadavpur minibus which I used for a large part of my working life. I continue to wear them now and recommend them strongly for secure feet and better walking in old age. Keep soft open sandals for home wear with a small heel (use the kind initially named after a doctor), because dropped arches are aplenty at our time of life.         
	Pamper yourself with an occasional facial or pedicure. Dye or streak your hair: the choice nowadays is immense. And if the classic understated look is your preference, enjoy that too!

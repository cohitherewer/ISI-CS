The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Politics of Sourav plot
                                                                                                               Politics of Sourav plot
          A STAFF REPORTER                                      
	The apolitical protest by residents against Sourav Gangulys proposed school in Salt Lakes CA block took a Trinamul versus CPM turn on Tuesday with some urban mati and a famous manush in the turf tussle.        
	Around 50 Trinamul leaders and NGO workers descended on the block around 7am and cried their lungs out into the microphone for over four hours to protest the former Team India skippers project  the decibel demon disrupting classes in two schools.        
	Halfway through the protest, painter  and Mamata Banerjee ally  Shuvaprasanna turned up and urged Sourav to watch his step.        
	Sourav is Bengals pride but he is walking into the CPMs trap by trying to set up a school in a residential area. He has got the plot cheap because of his close ties with urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya, said the resident of Salt Lakes BH 167.        
	The Trinamul is maligning Sourav only to further its selfish cause, shot back the minister. As for the residents protest, he said: I cant figure out why they are against such a noble cause.        
	Sanjay Chatterjee, a relative of Sourav involved in the project, said late on Tuesday: As of now, the project is on.        
	The CA Block Residents Association, opposing the project because Souravs proposed school will come up between two others, adding to the chaos and congestion, had made it clear that it would not allow politicians to hijack their spontaneous movement.        
	But that did not deter a clutch of local Trinamul leaders and workers  none of them a resident of the block  from showing up at the protest venue, opposite CA 222, the plot earmarked for the school.        
	Some leaders like Trinamul town committee president Sabyasachi Dutta claimed they had come not as party functionaries but as members of an NGO, Humanity. The tenor of their speeches, however, bore the stamp of a Trinamul poll campaign.        
	We have five councillors against the Left Fronts 18. The ratio will be reversed in the next poll, asserted a protester, vowing to go to any length to ensure that Sourav abandons his dream project.        
	Sunil Chowdhury, the secretary of the residents association, said: Some residents might have gone there but our organisation had nothing to do with the protest.        
	Haryana Vidyamandir, 25 metres from the protest site, had a tough time holding its classes, because of the blaring loudspeakers. Had we known about the meeting, we could have shifted the classes to rooms at the far end of the compound, said principal Nandini Sen. Sumit Sengupta, the secretary of CA School, around 45 metres away, said: Such protests should not be held near schools.

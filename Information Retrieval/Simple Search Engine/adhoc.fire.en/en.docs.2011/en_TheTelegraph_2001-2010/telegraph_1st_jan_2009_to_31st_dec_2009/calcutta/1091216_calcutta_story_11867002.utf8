The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bank under probe for withdrawal fraud
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Bank under probe for withdrawal fraud
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	A woman has moved the high court alleging that Rs 5 lakh had been fraudulently withdrawn from her account with HDFC Bank after the authorities issued a duplicate debit card of her account to another person.        
	Justice Pranab Kumar Chattopadhyay on Tuesday ordered a CID probe into the complaint, which says the duplicate card had been sent to Biblap De, a resident of Belghoria. The inspector-general of the CID will conduct a probe and file a report within eight weeks, the judge said.        
	The petitioner (name withheld to protect identity), a resident of Baguiati, informed the court that she had sold her six-cottah plot in 2004 for Rs 10 lakh.        
	I had kept the entire amount in two accounts with the HDFC Bank branch in Raghunathpur. A sum of Rs 4 lakh was deposited in a fixed deposit account and the rest in a savings account, the petitioner stated.        
	The bank issued her a debit card which she said she used regularly to withdraw money. But on July 31 I found my card had been locked when I tried to withdraw money from an ATM in Raghunathpur, the woman mentioned in her complaint.        
	Her lawyer said she had immediately contacted the bank and was told to apply for a duplicate card.        
	She had sent the application but did not get the card... The bank statement showed that over Rs 5 lakh had been withdrawn from her account between April 28 and June 9, said Mohan Kumar Sanyal, who appeared for Mondal.        
	The lawyer also informed the court that the bank had told her client that the duplicate card had been issued to Biplab De, a Belghoria resident.        
	The bank later wrote to my client that the duplicate debit card had been issued on April 27, three months before she had applied for one. The fraudulent withdrawals started the day after the duplicate card was issued to Dey, said Sanyal.        
	The lawyer alleged that the woman had lodged complaints with the bank and the police. But neither took any action. Nisith Adhikari, the additional advocate-general, submitted that the police had started a probe.        
	The Mumbai-headquartered bank was not represented though Sanyal claimed it had received a notice from the high court. An official of the bank in Calcutta said he was unaware of the case.

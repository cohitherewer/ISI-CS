                                                                                                               Car gang busted, five arrested 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	An inter-state car theft racket operating in the city and its suburbs was busted this week, North 24-Parganas police said on Thursday. Eight vehicles have been recovered.        
	All five gang members were arrested, including leader Sajid Ali Khan, 37, said Supratim Sarkar, the superintendent of North 24-Parganas police.        
	Sajid is a master in opening locked cars. He prised open the lock of the boot and used it to prepare a master key, with which he opened the car and drove it away, he added.         
	The police said Sajid had served 22 months in a Mumbai jail for stealing cars and was released in December 2008. He came to Calcutta in January and started operating his gang.        
	The gang had stolen two cars from Salt Lake on April 1 and one from Dum Dum on April 23. We noticed a similarity in the modus operandi and started a probe. We zeroed in on Aashique Akhtar of Habra, who owns a garage and was trying to sell two Santros, said an officer. The stolen cars include Santros, Sumos and Chevrolet cars.        
	Akhtar revealed Sajid was married to a girl from Berachapa in Deganga and often visited her there. We nabbed Sajid from his in-laws house, said Sarkar.         
	The cops said Sajid introduced himself as an executive of Tata Motors to the girls father, who owns a workshop. Sajid used to visit the workshop to get stolen cars repaired.         
	The girls father was fooled by Sajid and arranged his daughters marriage with the young man in April. He helped us nab Sajid, the officer said.        
	After Sajids arrest, the police nabbed the three remaining gang members  Qutub Mondal, Sukanta Sen and Sankar Saha.

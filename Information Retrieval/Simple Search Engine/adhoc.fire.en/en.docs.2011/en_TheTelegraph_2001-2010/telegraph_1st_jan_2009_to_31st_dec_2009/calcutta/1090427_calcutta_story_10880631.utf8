	The mercury crossed the 40 degree Celsius mark for the fourth consecutive day on Sunday and the low minimum relative humidity meant there were no rain clouds in sight.        
	On Sunday, the temperature touched 40.6 degree Celsius, five degrees above normal. The minimum temperature was 27.4 degree Celsius, a degree above normal.        
	The relative humidity hit a high of 92 per cent but stayed below 20 per cent for the better part of the day, keeping the discomfort index in check at 62 degree Celsius.         
	The absence of moisture in the air, however, also means that no rain is in sight and hence, more days of 40-plus temperature.        
	Monday is likely to be hot and uncomfortable. The temperature is likely to range between 40 and 28 degree Celsius. There is no chance of rain in the next 24 hours as the conditions are not conducive to Norwesters, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	Hot, dry northwesterlys blowing in over south Bengal from central and north India are responsible for the heat wave conditions, said a weather official.        
	The power situation improved on Sunday, primarily because of low demand.         
	CESC officials said the shortfall in the city was 40MW in the evening, when demand was about 300MW less than on a weekday. Domestic consumers did not face power cuts, said a CESC official.

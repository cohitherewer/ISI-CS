The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Poll keeps Part I results waiting
                                                                            Wednesday , November 4 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Poll keeps Part I results waiting
  - Last-minute change stumps students        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Exam results can apparently wait till politicians pass the weekend poll test.        
	The fledgling West Bengal State University was forced to withhold its Part I results due on Tuesday after a last-minute communiqu from the administration to keep 33,000-odd students waiting until after November 7, when Alipore and Belgachhia East go to poll along with eight other Assembly constituencies.        
	We were ready with the results. Unfortunately, we had to postpone the announcement after we received an instruction from the administration asking us to suspend the process till November 7, registrar Kamales Bhaumik told Metro.        
	Bhaumik declined to divulge the reason cited by the administration for the postponement but a source insisted that the date was a giveaway. The word from Writers Buildings was to keep the results in abeyance to eliminate the prospect of any anomalies in the results having an impact on the election process, the source added.        
	Exam results affecting an election outcome may seem far-fetched but speculation ranged from the administration just playing safe to the political party at the helm seeing even college exams as a potential threat to its poll prospects.        
	A more plausible explanation given the lack of an official one  even vice-chancellor Ashoke Ranjan Thakur, who is out of station, claimed he didnt know the reason  was that the university authorities were unsure about the accuracy of the results and the administration didnt want any controversy before the bypoll.        
	A portion of the BSc honours results declared by the university just before Puja was allegedly erroneous. Many students immediately moved the university council for re-evaluation citing tabulation errors in their marksheets.         
	The government was wary of similar protests on the eve of the bypoll, which is why it asked the university to postpone the results by a few days, an official said.        
	For the 33,000-odd examinees from over 56 affiliated colleges on the northern fringes of the city, the postponement was a bolt from the blue. Many of them had logged in early on Tuesday to check their results online not knowing what the authorities had decided.        
	The university did not even bother to update its website. Till late on Tuesday evening, the website said that results would be pouring in from Tuesday.         
	 I sat glued to the computer since morning hoping the results would be put up. The authorities obviously couldnt be bothered about what we suffered, said Ankit Bhattacharya (name changed), a BSc honours student of Dum Dum Motijheel College.         
	Jhuma Chakraborty (name changed), a student of Rashtraguru Surendranath College, said that even the college authorities didnt know about the decision taken by the university.        
	Around 4.40pm, a large number of students gathered near my chamber wanting to know why their results hadnt been declared on the scheduled date. I called up the university authorities to inquire about the delay, and it was only then that I was told about the postponement, said Dipak Chakraborty, the principal of Dum Dum Motijheel College.        
	The official Chakraborty spoke to informed him that the university needed some more time to complete the process of preparing the results.         
	Vice-chancellor Thakur said he would find out the exact reason for postponing the results after returning to Calcutta on Wednesday.         
	West Bengal State University was formed to ease Calcutta Universitys burden. The 2008-09 academic session was its first.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Winter chill on way back
                                                                                                               Winter chill on way back
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The winter chill that has been eluding the city for the past few days is likely to be felt again from Wednesday.         
	The Met office said on Sunday that the minimum temperature might reverse its upward trend after 48 hours.         
	The minimum temperature on Sunday shot up to 18.8 degrees Celsius as an anti-cyclonic circulation (clockwise movement of air) over the Bengal coast is blocking the North Wind, which itself has become weak.         
	The normal minimum temperature around this time is 14 degrees.         
	The North Wind has stopped blowing. And because of the anti-cyclonic circulation, there is a heavy build-up of warm moisture from the sea, leading to a rise in the minimum temperature. The formation is likely to weaken by Tuesday afternoon, clearing the way for the North Wind, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the weather section at Regional Meteorological Centre, Alipore.         
	By Wednesday, the minimum temperature is expected to drop by three to four degrees, giving us a feel of the winter again.         
	Met officials said December 2008 was unusually warm. The minimum temperature on December 11 was 20.6 degrees, the highest on any December day in the past 10 years. The minimum temperature on December 11, 2006, was 20 degrees.

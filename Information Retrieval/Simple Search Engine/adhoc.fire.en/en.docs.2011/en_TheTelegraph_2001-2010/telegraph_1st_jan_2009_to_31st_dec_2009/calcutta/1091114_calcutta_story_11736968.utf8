  - Unusual power demand, diseases mark warm November          MEGHDEEP BHATTACHARYYA AND SANJAY MANDAL              
	Friday the 13th (of November) was the hottest in a decade with the weatherman warning of no respite in sight, doctors swamped by summer diseases, and CESC struggling to cope with the highest demand in the first half of November since it started generating power in 1899.        
	A fortnight into November, consumers are still using air-conditioners and fans while lights are being switched on early because of the shorter days. The key factor is the weather. The warm and shorter days in the first half of this unusual November have resulted in this record demand, despite a strike at many jute mills, which collectively consume about 100MW at peak hour, said a CESC official. The demand has forced CESC to generate around 1,000MW, import around 500MW from other agencies and not export power.        
	On Friday, the minimum temperature was 23.2 degrees Celsius, four degrees above normal, as the city sweated under cloudy skies, that lock in heat and raise humidity levels.        
	After cyclone Phyans impact, a high pressure belt over the Bay of Bengal will keep the temperature well above normal for at least another 72 hours, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.                          
	On Friday, the maximum temperature too was three degrees above normal at 32.8 degrees Celsius. The humidity ranged between 48 per cent and 95 per cent. The discomfort index, as a result, touched 63 degrees Celsius, eight notches above normal.        
	Partly cloudy skies are expected over the weekend, with temperatures ranging between 24 and 33 degrees Celsius, said the Met office.        
	Winter continues to play truant, warns the weatherman. There is no sign of winters onset. We are still a few weeks away from experiencing what can technically be termed as winter, said Debnath.        
	That is not good news for doctors, what with summer diseases breaking out like a rash. In winters, the general health condition remains good for people, except for those suffering from respiratory tract diseases and arthritis. But now we are treating water-borne diseases, malaria, dengue and other summer ailments, said critical care expert Subrata Maitra.         
	According to hospitals and clinics, patients are being admitted with viral fever, diarrhoea, typhoid, malignant malaria, dengue and other gastrointestinal diseases.        
	Because of the warm temperature, the number of malaria and dengue cases are definitely higher than in previous years, said a senior health official of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation         
	The prevention-is-better-than-cure directive from the doctors desk read: avoid sudden change in temperatures, dont drink chilled water, consult a doctor if unwell.

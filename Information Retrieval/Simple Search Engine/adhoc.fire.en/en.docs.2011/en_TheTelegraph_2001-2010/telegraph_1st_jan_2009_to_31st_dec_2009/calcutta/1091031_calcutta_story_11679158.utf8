                                                                                                               Some listen, some dont     Poll panel bows to save-library brigade
          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                            THE NATIONAL LIBRARY CAGED AND THE METRO CHANNEL CLOGGED: The library (top) will be spared the assault it suffered when the Election Commission took over the premises for the Lok Sabha polls. But there is no respite in sight for the Metro channel which played host to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and his partymen on Friday in yet another traffic-stopper rally (below).

	The Election Commission has decided not to requisition National Library for the Alipore by-election next month, signalling a victory for those protesting the poll panels predatory tactics at the abode of books.        
	We have decided not to take over National Library for the ensuing by-election because we felt that we should not disturb the readers, chief electoral officer Debashis Sen told Metro, which had run a campaign to save the seat of learning from being mauled by the election army during the Lok Sabha poll.        
	Sen said the poll panel had conveyed to National Library director K.K. Banerjee its decision not to requisition the 30-acre premises for any bypoll-related activity. Now you can say that we (the Election Commission) also have a human face, the chief electoral officer added.        
	So does it mean permanent relief from poll peril for the countrys premier library?        
	The decision has been taken with reference to this by-election. I cannot comment on the future, but we are definitely looking for a permanent alternative, Sen said.        
	Director Banerjee thanked the poll panel for taking a decision in the interest of the library and its readers.        
	A library official who did not wish to be named added: Good sense has prevailed. We are really happy that they have decided not to violate the sanctity of the library.         
	Although the Representation of Peoples Act empowers the Election Commission to requisition public premises for poll-related work, the takeover of National Library in the face of reader opposition was seen as a violation of the spirit of the law.        
	What made it worse was the state of the Belvedere Road address after the 20-day poll invasion in May. I shudder at the thought of the bamboo sheds, littered greens, open-air kitchens, and the stench. The promised repair job was not only delayed but also tardy. Against this backdrop, the decision to spare the premises for the bypoll is a big victory for us, said Abhijit Dey, who has been frequenting the library for years.        
	The poll panel has requisitioned the Alipore Teachers Training College in Hastings for the Assembly bypoll, necessitated by actor-turned-politician Tapas Pal vacating the seat after being elected MP.        
	Academician Sukanta Chaudhuri had suggested two other Belvedere Road addresses  the Eastern Railway Officers Club and Rambrahma Sanyal Smriti Sadan  as alternatives during Metros save-National Library campaign.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who had once apologised for attending a business meet at the library that inconvenienced readers, recently got the Union culture ministry to set up an advisory board to make the institution more user-friendly.

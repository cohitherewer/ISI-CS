The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CID help in Yash murder probe
                                                                                                               CID help in Yash murder probe
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The state government has asked the CID to help the Howrah police in investigating the abduction and murder of Yash Lakhotia.        
	We are providing technical support, such as analysing the call records of the suspects, to the district police, Bhupinder Singh, the additional director-general of the CID, said on Tuesday.        
	The seven-year-old was abducted last Thursday and found dead on Saturday morning but the sleuths are yet to arrest prime accused Santosh Singh, who is believed to be hiding in Bihar.        
	An officer admitted that the sleuths were not yet certain about the motive behind the murder.        
	The cops during the day raided several pockets in Howrah and picked up a few men who were allegedly close to Santosh.        
	We are still looking for Gabbar and Bapi, two associates of Santosh. We have learnt that Santosh used to meet them in their hideout in north Howrahs Chambal gali, said an officer investigating the case.        
	Chambal gali, he added, is the refuge of several criminals of Howrah. As for Gabbar and Bapi, the officer said Santosh often used them to grab land in the district.        
	The cops suspect that Santosh had kept Yash somewhere in north Howrah, probably in Bhotebagan or Ghusuri, after abducting him from school.        
	Earlier we thought the boy was kept in one of the Foreshore Road godowns, close to the spot where the body was found. But a raid on the godowns did not yield anything conclusive, said an officer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Road-hog pandals
                                                                                                               Road-hog pandals
                                          
	A special officer appointed by the high court inspected the RK Chatterjee Road Adhibasi Brinda pandal in Kasba on Tuesday to verify the organisers claim that they had kept 4ft of the road free. Justice Sanjib Banerjee appointed the special officer following a submission by a resident, Ishita Chakraborty, that the puja committee had violated the fire departments order to leave 4ft of the thoroughfare open.        
	The court, acting on a plea by Chakraborty, asked the committee on Monday to dismantle the illegal part of the pandal by next morning. Fire department officials inspected the site on Tuesday and reported to the court that the committee had abided by their norm. But Chakraborty said the distance between her window and the pandal was less than 4ft even after Monday nights trimming.        
	The special officer just noted down the measurements and didnt reveal his findings, said Tapas Sengupta, a spokesperson for the club.

	The pandal for the 66-year-old puja blocks the arm of Maniktala Main Road next to the Bagmari flyover and the turn towards Dewanji Bagan. Motorcycles and cycles that used to frequent the stretch can no longer do so because of the 100ft-long, 20ft-wide pandal. We have received clearances from police, fire services, CESC and the CMC, said Ajoy Ghosh, an organiser.

	The pandal spreads across an over-20ft-wide street in Azadgarh, off NSC Bose Road, near Ranikuthi crossing. The 2ft left free on one side is barely enough for pedestrians to squeeze through. We have obtained clearances from the fire services, the CMC and CESC. We will apply for police permission on Wednesday, said Joy Ghosh, the secretary of the organising committee.

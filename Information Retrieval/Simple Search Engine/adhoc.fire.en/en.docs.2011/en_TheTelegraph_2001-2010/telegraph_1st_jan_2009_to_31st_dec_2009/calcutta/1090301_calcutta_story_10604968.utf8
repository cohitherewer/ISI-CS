	The Foundation for the Economic Rehabilitation of Rural Youth (Ferry) celebrated its 25th year recently. In a country where the mortality rate of NGOs is high, it is quite unusual to find a voluntary organisation lasting the long haul.     
	Ferry has been working almost unnoticed for over two decades to generate employment in rural Bengal. So it was only fitting that the year-long silver jubilee celebrations, which had begun at the Baidyapur project site in Burdwan, were wrapped up in Rampurhat with a programme attended by the organisations trainers, patrons, and hundreds of past and present trainees. A convention was also held at Vivekananda Hall at Jadavpur University in December 2008 as part of the celebrations.    
	Ferry came into being in 1983 with the aim of the working among rural youth, focusing on vocational training. It has trained nearly 2,000 young women and men in Birbhum, Burdwan and Hooghly in skills like poultry farming, carpentry, nursing assistantship, house wiring, quail raising, machine knitting and embroidery and repair of two-wheelers and electrical and electronic goods. The training is imparted for free.     
	The journey hasnt been easy. In Burdwan, setting up poultry farming proved to be a challenge because of the lack of feed manufacturers. Ferry trainers restructured their course and introduced feed manufacturing to make their trainees self-sufficient in poultry farming.    
	In Birbhum, Ferrys training has changed the lives of a number of rural women, especially those from Muslim households. Many have combined their training with entrepreneurial skills and become role models for their community. One such success story is of Farida Begum, the mother of nine girls, who trained at Ferry for a machine knitting course 10 years ago and went on to start her own production unit. Soon, parties across the political spectrum were wooing her to contest the panchayat polls. She refused, perhaps sensibly so.    
	Ferry runs mostly on private donations, rather than state grants or large institutional funds. DIG eV, an Indo-German friendship group, is a longstanding partner. At the closing ceremony in Rampurhat, the friends from Germany were gifted scarves embroidered by the trainees. The scarves were refreshingly different from anything the embroidery girls had done so far, and told the story of the discovery of modern designs and patterns. These scarves and stoles have found a market in Calcutta. In keeping with the times, Ferry is now planning to introduce a course in physiotherapy at Rampurhat.    
	Ground zero    
	Mean Sea Level, a documentary by Pradip Saha on sinking islands in the Sunderbans, was launched in Ghoramara on February 25 in the presence of governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi.     
	The island of 5000-plus people, 150km south of Calcutta, has shrunk in half to 4.8sq km in the past 25 years. The fate of its population is uncertain as rehabilitation efforts have stopped in the last five years, says the panchayat pradhan of Ghoramara Mandirtala, Sujata Das. Lohachara, a neighbouring island, went under 18 years ago. Sagar, the largest island in the area, where climate change refugees were resettled, looks destined to a watery grave as well.     
	The launch of the documentary on ground zero, so to speak, was a conscious decision. Despite the logistic problems of organising the event here, we wanted to start the journey of the film from where we began, said Saha.     
	The projector gave up several times because of the heat inside the pandal erected for the screening. The organisers tried several times, but the screening had to be abandoned halfway.    
	The people of Ghoramara have seen the governor on television, thanks to solar panels installed in about 100 households with an 80 per cent government subsidy. For them he represents hope.     
	We have given the governor a petition listing our problems. The little help that we have received has been from the government. Several NGOs have come and gone, but have done nothing, said the panchayat pradhan.    
	Ghoramara is not just an island, but a symbol of the problem that besieges the world, said Gandhi.    
	He asked a grocer if he used plastic packets in his shop and wanted to know more about the solar panels from the villagers.     
	The West Bengal Renewable Energy Development Agency is working towards installing solar panels in every household in Ghoramara, said S.P. Gonchowdhury, the director of the green agency.    
	But whom will the panels serve when there is no island left?

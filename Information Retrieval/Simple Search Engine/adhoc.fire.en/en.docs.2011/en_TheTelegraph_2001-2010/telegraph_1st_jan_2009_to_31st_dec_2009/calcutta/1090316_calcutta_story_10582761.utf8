The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Whoosh ends in whimper
                                                                                                               Whoosh ends in whimper
  - Rush to pick up racket but potential champions too few          SUBHRO SAHA AND RITH BASU                          Children being trained at South Club. Picture by Rith Basu                                        
	Watch the ball, racket back, take a full swing and complete the follow-through.... Whoosh!        
	Young Vikas Singh is being put through his paces by former Indian Davis Cup coach Akhtar Ali at South Club. Can the eight-year-old, an exceptional talent in Alis reckoning, realise his potential and break into the big league? Not many will bet on that.         
	Not just because Vikass father is an orderly at a city club and there will be too many financial breakpoints to be saved en route, but because Calcuttas tennis crche is ill-equipped to churn out champions.        
	The recent exploits of Sania Mirza, Somdev Dev Varman and Yuki Bhambri have fired the imagination of tennis kids and parents and the courts at the 10-plus coaching schemes around town are buzzing with the whoosh of racket on ball. Yet, how many of these 4,000-odd children, between five and 16 years of age, can become decent tennis players? Not too many, warns Hironmoy Chatterjee, the secretary of the Bengal Tennis Association (BTA), the parent body of the game in the state.  
	 ldquo;Although we have around 30 AITA-certified Level I coaches in Calcutta, the attitude at many of the coaching centres remains lackadaisical and you often see malis and sweepers hitting with the trainees, rdquo; explains Chatterjee.  
	 The calibre of coaches leaves a lot to be desired, and early course correction of flaws doesn rsquo;t often happen, says Ali, at the helm of the BTA rsquo;s ldquo;elite rdquo; coaching project.  
	 Sujoy Ghosh, the administrative head of the BTA programme, adds a drop-out dimension to the dilemma. ldquo;Today, the biggest roadblock we face is the vanishing act once a child reaches the age of 15-16, when the board exams win the decisive point over tennis. So we lose potential champions like Amit Singh Rawat, Danielle Jones and Arindam Roy Chowdhury, rdquo; he laments.  
	 Former Davis Cup ace Jaidip Mukerjea, who runs an academy in Salt Lake, agrees that the void created at the Class X stage is costing the junior system dear. ldquo;A lot of kids quit tennis at 15-16 when their focus shifts to studies. You cannot blame them since only the very best can make a decent living out of tennis. rdquo;  
	 But there has been a 60 per cent increase in the number of kids taking up the sport in the past five years, and the interest will be sustained through success stories like Yuki and Somdev. ldquo;Yuki played tournaments at the BTA and Somdev practised for three years at South Club, rdquo; stresses Ghosh.  
	 Those aspiring to be the next Leander or Sania can relate to homebred champs. ldquo;Somdev rsquo;s performance has inspired me a lot. He showed we can compete with the best and emerge on top, rdquo; says 10-year-old Aishwariya Kundu, a Class IV student of St John rsquo;s Diocesan School, who picked up the racket four years ago.  
	 There are a few who are encouraged by their parents to take the plunge into the pro circuit, relegating mainstream academics to the backburner. The city trio of Shivika Burman, Treta Bhattacharya and Deepti Srivastava have all flown abroad to sharpen their serve-and-volley, which costs their parents big bucks.  
	 ldquo;There aren rsquo;t too many parents in Calcutta mentally prepared to take this risk. Against these three girls, there could be at least 40 kids from Chennai training abroad now to become professional tennis players, rdquo; says the BTA secretary, lamenting that Bengal doesn rsquo;t have a ldquo;single player of substance rdquo; in the under-16 category at present.  
	 Money remains a huge constraint and the sports department doesn rsquo;t loosen its purse strings for tennis, deemed an ldquo;elite rdquo; sport alongside golf. The state association had somehow managed to garner enough sponsorship funds to send the promising Rupesh Roy to the US, but is now hamstrung after having spent over Rs 2 crore to set up its Salt Lake complex.

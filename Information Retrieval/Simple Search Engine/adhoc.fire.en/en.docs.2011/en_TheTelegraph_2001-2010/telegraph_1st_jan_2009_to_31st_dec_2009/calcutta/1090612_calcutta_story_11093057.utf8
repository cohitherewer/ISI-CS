The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cyclone does citizen a favour
                                                                                                               Cyclone does citizen a favour
  - Aila manages what CMC couldnt  fell an intrusive banyan tree          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                          The banyan tree lies next to a wall of Sujit Ghoshs house. (Amit Datta)                                        
	Aila did in one afternoon what Sujit Kumar Ghosh couldnt get the Calcutta Municipal Corporation to do in nine years: evict an intruder from his home.        
	Ghosh, a retired senior manager of Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers, is surely the only resident of the city who has the cyclone to thank.        
	A roadside banyan tree was making life miserable for us all these years. Its roots had damaged the walls of a room and even reached the ceiling. I petitioned the civic authorities several times to remove the tree but no action was taken. Even a court order didnt help. But then came Aila, the 62-year-old resident of 25 Sambhunath Pandit Street told Metro on Thursday.        
	The uprooted banyan has been lying next to the house and over the roadside temple on which it fell since May 24, but Ghosh doesnt really mind. If the cyclone hadnt felled the tree, I would have had to do the rounds of the CMC for the next 20 years, said the man who has been staying since 1974 in the single-storey house that his family had bought in 1962.        
	When Ghosh had first petitioned the CMC in 2000, he was asked to approach the forest department. In 2003, a divisional forest officer inspected the site  close to the gurdwara off SSKM Hospital  and wrote to the pollution control board for permission to fell the tree. The green signal came after two years and the mayor took another 11 months to give his approval.        
	When everything was finalised, some residents of the area wouldnt allow the tree-felling. They feared that the small temple and the adjacent room that houses a club would be damaged, an official said.        
	Ghosh then filed a writ petition in the high court and Justice Pinaki Ghosh ordered the CMC last March to resolve the issue within three weeks. But as the CMC dithered, Aila arrived to do the needful.        
	We had decided to seek the polices help but the cyclone did the job for us, smiled Somnath Sen, the executive engineer (parks amp; gardens).

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bus mows down boy on first day of college
                                                                                                               Bus mows down boy on first day of college
          A STAFF REPORTER                      Surojit Banerjee                          
	A 20-year-old Howrah boy cycling to his first day in college was mowed down by a minibus metres away from the gate to the institution on Monday.        
	Police quoted witnesses as saying that the Howrah-Khadarghat minibus was racing another when it crushed Surojit Banerjee, a BA fresher at Azad Hind Fauj Smriti Mahavidyalaya in Domjur, under its wheels.        
	After knocking down the boy, the vehicle rammed into a roadside tree with such force that it was uprooted. Around six students standing near the tree were injured. The passengers escaped unhurt.        
	I was waiting for a friend when I saw the speeding bus about to hit the cyclist. I could do little but turn my face away. It was only later that I came to know that the victim was from my batch, said Sanjay Manna, a BA first-year student.        
	The driver and conductor of the minibus got off the vehicle and fled immediately after the accident.         
	Ajit Dey, a second-year student of the college, said he and several others saw the minibus racing another on route No. 63.         
	The driver lost control and first hit Surojit, who had just got off his bicycle to walk the last few metres to the college gate. We were all in a daze for a few seconds after the accident, which gave the driver and the conductor an opportunity to flee, he added.        
	Senior students took Surojit to the state-run Domjur Hospital, where he was declared dead.         
	I wanted my son to get a good education and do well in life. So I sent him to college despite financial constraints. I never thought my dream would be shattered in this manner, cried Surojits father.        
	Hari Kishore Kusumakar, the new superintendent of police in Howrah, declined comment on whether rash driving had caused the accident. Investigation is underway. I have not yet received details from the probe team.

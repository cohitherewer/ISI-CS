The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fear of fire at Book Fair
                                                                                                               Fear of fire at Book Fair
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Five days before the Calcutta Book Fair starts, the fire services department on Thursday questioned the fire safety arrangements at Milon Mela where the event will be held.        
	At a meeting chaired by chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti and attended by the police commissioner and officials of various departments, it was decided that fire officers would inspect the ground off the Bypass on January 25 and decide whether a no-objection certificate could be issued.        
	We will check if there is enough space for manoeuvring fire tenders, said fire services director-general Gopal Bhattacharya.        
	A 20-member panel has been set up to ensure smooth functioning of the fair.

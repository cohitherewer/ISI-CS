                      Glimpses of Ray and his world                    It is a rare treat to be taken on a photographic journey which takes a glimpse into the life of Bengals renaissance personality Satyajit Ray. With rare passion and precision, lensman Nemai Ghosh has captured creative moments that reveal the great master at work. The photographs capture Ray, the master director, on the sets and off them. Satyajit Ray  From Script to Screen is a tribute to the multi-faceted genius of Ray, who was a film-maker, story-writer, graphic designer, artist and musician. They capture Ray in time, through the visual metronome of Ghoshs camera. They capture Ray not merely as a director, but also as the unseen force behind his creations. Launched to mark the first anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore Centre of ICCR, Calcutta. Hosted by ICCR and National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi. Also, daily viewings of documentaries: In Conversation with Nemai Ghosh (at 1 pm) and My Life With Manikda (at 3 pm).

	An antique dealer was arrested in his Maniktala house early on Sunday and 18th century antiques stolen from the Law house seized from his possession.         
	Sandip Chowdhury was produced in Bankshall court along with five others, who had allegedly committed the robbery last week, and remanded in police custody till December 19.        
	According to police, Chowdhury used to buy stolen articles from the five.        
	The theft at the 123-year-old Law house was noticed on December 1 after a guard saw shadows moving on the roof at dawn. When the Laws opened the door of the room where the family collection is stored, they found a hole in the ceiling and a rope hanging through it. Some items were missing.        
	The sculptures, vases, paintings and other articles in the room were collected by Bhabani Churn Law, whose granddaughter Lakshmi Law now stays in a portion of the house with family members.         
	The five alleged robbers  including their leader Shamim Haoladar, alias Hassan  were arrested in different parts of South 24-Parganas on Saturday night.        
	Investigators claimed that Chowdhury had told Hassan, who was arrested in 2006 in connection with another case of antique theft, about the valuables in the room of the Law house.        
	Chowdhury even told Hassan about the type of antiques in the room. We are interrogating Chowdhury to find out who else were part of the antique theft network, said an officer in the detective department.        
	Sleuths interrogated another antique dealer from Dunlop area. He was examined by officers of Criminal Investigation Department after the theft of a Nobel medallion from Santiniketan. We are waiting for more leads. If we find his involvement, he will be booked, added the officer.

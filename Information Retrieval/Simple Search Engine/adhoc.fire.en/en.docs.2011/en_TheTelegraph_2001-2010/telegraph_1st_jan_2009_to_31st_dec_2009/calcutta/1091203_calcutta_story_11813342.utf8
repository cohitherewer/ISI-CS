The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Stage set for lil champs
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Stage set for lil champs
          MALINI BANERJEE                          east and west: The preliminary rounds of the fusion dance competition (above and below) at the Dabur Red The Great TTIS Challenge 2009 at Swabhumi saw 91 schools in the fray.

	The biggest school carnival in town is back.        
	Seventeen events, 130 participating schools, more than 4,500 students  no wonder The Dabur Red The Great TTIS Challenge 2009 is the event on the teen calendar.        
	Hear it from a TTIS tiger (cub reporters for The Telegraph in Schools). I wait the whole year for this event. Ive been here all five times, even the time I had my pre-board exams and I am here this time even though my school (Lakshmipat Singhania Academy) isnt participating. That is how important this fest is to me, says Nidhi T, of Class XII.        
	The preliminary round of the fifth edition wraps up on Thursday and the three-day finals begin on Friday at Swabhumi. The opening act will star singer Rupankar and Krosswindz will bring the curtains down, while famous faces will dot the days to add to the carnival mood.        
	The real stars of course will be the little champs. And they will be fighting it out at events galore. Three minutes to fame (impress the judges with any performance, but within three minutes), creative writing, fusion dance and a fashion show are just some of them.        
	Unconventional Orchestra means making music without musical instruments and last year saw students using everything from plastic buckets to steel plates and dusters. Mock a Band gets you a prize for imitating your favourite band without the required vocal skills. Then theres the Tug of War, with more than 80 schools and at least 160 matches on a grassy patch at Swabhumi, spread out over four hours.        
	The crowning glory? Champion of Champions, an award that goes to the school with the most number of winning participants, plus a crown for a student with the maximum triumphs. Last year, the trophy was won by a little-known school in south Calcutta, Hirendra Leela Patranabis School.        
	Winning the trophy last year felt like being on top of the world. But now there is pressure from everywhere to win again. We are participating in more events this year so we have an equally good chance of winning, says Sayantan Ganguly, the schools representative for the Carnival.

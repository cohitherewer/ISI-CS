The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Land devil logs out IT dream
                                                                                                               Land devil logs out IT dream
          SUBHRO SAHA AND CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE                                        
	The great IT dream. R.I.P.        
	With the state information technology department announcing on Monday that it has no land to offer Infosys and Wipro following the Vedic Village fiasco, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees IT adventure is dead and buried for now, mourn insiders.        
	The failure of the project, and under such murky circumstances, is going to be a body blow to the perception of the city as an emerging IT hub, said a senior official of an IT solutions company. It is not just about missing out on Infosys and Wipro but the states inability to keep a commitment and that is a major setback for the industry.        
	Six years after being bestowed the public utility service status to beat bandhs and other political disruptions, the chief ministers blue-eyed sector has failed to make much headway. And now, the bubble has burst.        
	West Bengal, despite having a positive government, has faced many issues in the past two years and losing two big trendsetters who would have been followed by more companies is a setback to the states image, said Kiran Karnik, the ex-president of Nasscom.        
	According to government sources, the 600-acre IT park of Kolkata Links next to Vedic Village, housing Infosys and Wipro, would have generated around 2.25 lakh jobs.        
	It is very unfortunate because Bengals youngsters will be the biggest losers, said S. Radhakrishnan of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry.        
	That includes those waiting to come back home. I left the city in 2008 because of the poor work environment but I had my hopes pegged on Infosys setting up shop there, said a 30-year-old techie working in Bangalore.        
	Industry captains fear not just the loss of direct employment opportunities but also the ripple effect. Large companies like these spawn a tertiary economy of suppliers, placement agencies and others. The state will lose out on all such industries, said Kalyan Kar, the managing director of Acclaris.        
	In the post-Singur scenario, the sudden death of the Kolkata Links project could take the city back two decades when Calcutta was perceived fit for being only a recruitment hub of bright IT brains to be shipped to Chennai, Bangalore and Hyderabad.        
	Companies like Wipro, Tata Consultancy Services and IBM had recruitment offices on Camac Street, but they would not set up a permanent base in Calcutta because of political disruption and poor work culture, recounted a senior government official.        
	It was against this backdrop that the IT department drew up the IT vision policy projecting the knowledge capital of the country as the emerging IT destination.        
	Many within the IT industry feel that the government should not have buckled the way it did over Kolkata Links. Even if they were given the land tomorrow, Infosys and Wipro would not have come immediately because of the economic slowdown. The government should have used this opportunity to look for alternative land, said Kar.        
	But alternative land, according to IT department sources, is a mirage. Rajarhat is out of bounds because of Hidco (read Goutam Deb) setting the price bar too high, the 350-acre IT park in Jagadishpur is a non-starter because of the land acquiring process running into trouble, and the land at Kalyani offered to the IT majors was rejected.        
	There is no other land to offer, summed up an IT official.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fire in shops, pandals
                                                                                                               Fire in shops, pandals
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A series of fire mishaps marred the Diwali spirit in Calcutta and its neighbouring areas.        
	Three shops and a godown in Howrahs Salkia were badly damaged early on Sunday after they caught fire possibly from crackers. Four tenders took more than two hours to douse the blaze.        
	The godown, stacked with plastic goods, was possibly the first to catch fire. Residents said burnt ends of fireworks had fallen inside the godown through gaps in the asbestos roof. We are, however, not ruling out the possibility of a short-circuit, said a fire department official.        
	Two pandals in Lake Town and Dum Dum caught fire around the time the shops and the godown were damaged.        
	A car parked in front of a highrise off APC Road, near the Khanna crossing, was gutted in a fire around midnight. Two tenders doused the flames in 40 minutes. The fire might have been caused by some crackers, said an official of the fire services department.        
	A number of shanties in Tollygunge, Garden Reach and Kestopur were also damaged in fire early on Sunday.        
	Officers in the fire and emergency services department said they were flooded with calls on Diwali night.        
	We had cancelled the leave of our officers and more than 7,000 firemen were pressed into service on Saturday and Sunday night. All 449 fire tenders, including 20 new small vehicles, are ready to tackle any emergency, Gopal Bhattacharya, the director of fire and emergency services, said on Sunday night.

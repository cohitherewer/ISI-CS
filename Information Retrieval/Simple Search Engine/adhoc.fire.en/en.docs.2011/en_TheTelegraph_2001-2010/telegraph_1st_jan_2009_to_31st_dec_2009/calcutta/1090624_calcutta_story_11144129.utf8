                      Idea and identity                    The latest Tin Can offering by actor-producer Tanaji Dasgupta and director Soumyak Kanti De Biswas, Intro is a new-old play  it is an hour-long spectacle with a 10-minute story which ran for 10 shows to packed houses in Calcutta in 2006. Three years later, by public demand and through an invitation from National Theatre Scotland, they are performing it again, albeit in a whole new way with some old and some new cast members, in English, Hindi and Bengali. The idea is to give the audience a view of what can happen in a little lane with a little boy, and a bunch of marchers, flies, salesmen, politicians, fighters, souls, a rubiks cube and more. Through everything from live drumming, jazz samples to bass loops and a dirty song, it attempts to represent the theme of identity, isolation and existence in the modern, fragmented world. With pieces written by Walt Whitman, Benjamin Zephaniah, and even Shakespeare, Intro has an original script developed by Soumyak Kanti De Biswas. Intended as much more than just a theatre show, Tin Can has arranged for an innovative addition to the evenings performance. In between the two shows that are to be staged back-to-back, it will invite youth performers of the city who are breaking new grounds in the fields of music, dance, arts and photography to perform and showcase their work in the foyer area. Hosted in association with t2.                  Event: Intro, a play produced by Tin Can When: Today at 7 pm amp; 9 pm Where: Gyan Manch

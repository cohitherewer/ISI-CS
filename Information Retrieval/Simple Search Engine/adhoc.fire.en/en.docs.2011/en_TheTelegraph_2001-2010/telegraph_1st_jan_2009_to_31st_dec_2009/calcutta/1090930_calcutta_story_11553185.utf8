The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | IIT drive to inspire biz ventures
                                                                                                               IIT drive to inspire biz ventures
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur has launched an entrepreneurship drive covering 10 cities in 10 days to inspire young people to start their own businesses.         
	The drive aims to reach out to over 5,000 students in Chandigarh, Delhi, Lucknow, Bhopal, Pune, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Bhubaneswar and Kharagpur.        
	We have already created avenues of funding for small companies in IIT Kharagpur and we wanted to create a platform that would allow all students to utilise it, said D.P. Ankit, a member of the entrepreneurship cell.        
	The project kicked off on Tuesday at the Punjab Engineering College in Chandigarh and the Dayanandsagar College of Engineering in Bangalore. We are showcasing college start-ups and highlighting stories of college dropouts who became successful businessmen. Then there are case studies on people who have ventured into business after working for 20 or 25 years, said Ankit.        
	The list of speakers at these meets include Pramod Rao, the co-founder of Elitwit, Gerard J. Rego, the founder-CEO of Vayugrid, Murugavel Janakiraman, the founder of bharatmatrimony.com, and Rama Devi, the founder-chairman of the Association of Lady Entrepreneurs in Andhra Pradesh.        
	The entrepreneurship cell is not hosting the workshops on IIT campuses to spread awareness among a wider audience. The institute has introduced a system of deferred placement where students launching their own businesses can opt for campus placements after two years if the venture does not take off.        
	The drive comes to an end on October 8 at IIT Kharagpur and will be followed by an entrepreneurship summit in January.

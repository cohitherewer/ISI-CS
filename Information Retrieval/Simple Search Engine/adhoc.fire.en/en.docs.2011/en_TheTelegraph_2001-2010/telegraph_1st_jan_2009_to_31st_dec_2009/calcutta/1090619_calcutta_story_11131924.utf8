The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Downturn boost for tech studies
                                                                                                               Downturn boost for tech studies

	What managers were doing six months ago, engineers have started doing now.        
	Graduate engineers, in growing numbers, are queuing up for postgraduation courses as the global downturn forces companies to curb recruitment.        
	In doing so, they are following in the footsteps of managers making a beeline for B-schools in a bid to pick up more tools to beat the meltdown blues.        
	The number of applicants in the ME/MTech courses in all three premier institutions in the city  Jadavpur University (JU), Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) and Calcutta University (CU)  has shot up this admission season.        
	JU has received more than 10,000 applications for the 538 seats in the ME/MTech courses, 25 per cent more than last year and a record according to university insiders.        
	There has always been some demand for our ME and MTech courses but we have never seen such a rush for the seats. Last year, there were less than 8,000 applicants, said Bholanath Karmakar, the secretary of JUs engineering and technology faculty who is overseeing postgraduate admissions.        
	An official said more than half the seats in IT, computer science and engineering, and electronics and telecommunications were filled on the first day of admission.        
	The sudden rise in interest in pursuing postgraduation courses has come as a surprise to some as most engineers choose to join the industry after completing their BE or BTech.        
	Some students go to management institutes and a small percentage goes abroad. The demand for ME/ MTech courses is usually high only in the IITs. This rush for seats in postgraduate courses reveals that the situation is different this time, said Amit Roy, the CU science secretary.        
	A lot of factors have changed in the past couple of years. For instance, the mushrooming of tech schools has resulted in a spurt in the number of graduate engineers and more competition for jobs.        
	I did not get a decent job during campus placements. Though I could have got a marketing or entry-level job in a private firm, I have decided to study for another two years and improve my prospects, said one youngster who has applied for MTech in electrical engineering at CU.        
	For 18 seats in its MTech course in electrical engineering, CU has received over 600 applications, more than double of last year.        
	In Besu, the demand is high for IT, computer science and engineering, and electronics and telecommunications. The institution has received over 500 applications for 16 seats in these subjects, said Amit Kumar Das, the dean of engineering faculty.        
	A graduate engineer, who has applied for a postgraduate course in Besu, said: If the corporate sector continues to remain tight, I will have the option to shift to academia with a postgraduate degree.        
	While some academicians are happy with the rise in demand for ME/MTech courses, many think it is a fleeting trend forced by the squeeze in the job market and are not too hopeful about any immediate improvement in the quality of research.        
	The best graduates have either got jobs or moved abroad. Among the rest, I think most will switch to the corporate sector the moment the job market looks up, said P.K.Roy, a former teacher and a registrar of Besu.        
	Unless we attract the best brains to research, the country will lag behind, technologically, said Roy.

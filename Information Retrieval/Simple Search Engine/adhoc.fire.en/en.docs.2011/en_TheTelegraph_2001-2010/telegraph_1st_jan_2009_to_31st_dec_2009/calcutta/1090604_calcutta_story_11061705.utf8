The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | State nudge for more seats
                                                                                                               State nudge for more seats
  - Rise in college berths on the cards        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Students fretting over their college admission can breathe easy.        
	Infrastructure permitting, all undergraduate colleges in the state, especially the top-rung ones, may be asked to increase their seats by 10 per cent to cope with the rush of applicants, the government hinted on Wednesday.        
	The higher education department has asked the council of higher education to meet vice-chancellors of all universities in the state on Thursday and consider raising the number of seats in the affiliated colleges by 10 per cent.        
	The demand for seats in the BA, BSc and BCom courses is more this year following a rise in the number of students passing the Higher Secondary exams, higher education minister Sudarshan Ray Chaudhuri said.        
	Officials of the higher education council, in an attempt to accommodate more students in the undergraduate courses in general streams, will sit with the vice-chancellors on Thursday and decide on increasing the number of seats by 10 per cent, especially in reputable colleges. The authorities will take into account the infrastructure of the colleges before taking a decision, the minister added.        
	As of now, there are 3,16,000 seats in the 417 general degree colleges in the state. The count is set to go up by 12,000 as 10 more colleges are likely to be opened and 300 additional courses introduced this month. The present seat count in the city is little more than a lakh.        
	On the face of it, the existing seats are enough to avert any crisis. But as we have seen in previous years, a large number of students, particularly the high scorers, want to study in reputable colleges. We want to increase the number of students to ensure deserving students get to study in the college of their choice, Ray Chaudhuri clarified.        
	The ministers announcement should bring smiles to the students who have passed plus-II, many of whom feared being denied berths in prominent colleges because of better success rates in the HS, ISC and CBSE exams this year.        
	I wanted to study political science honours in a reputable college. But I dont think I have much of a chance as my marks are too low compared with others, said Dolly Ghosh (name changed) who has scored 54 per cent in HS (humanities).        
	According to an estimate given by the education department, as many as 3,92,640 students have cleared the plus-II hurdle in the state. More than 50,000 have scored above 80 per cent or more in HS, CBSE and ISC exams. In the HS, the number of A+ scorers (80 per cent or more) has gone up by one per cent compared with 2008.        
	The competition for college seats among high scorers is very tough this year. Those who have scored below 80 per cent may have to be content gaining admission in a middle-ranking college, a Calcutta University official said.         
	The rush is evident in the queues. We have 700 seats (only honours) but have already received more than 10,000 applications. Most applicants have scored very high in their Class XII exams, said John Abraham, the principal of Scottish Church College.         
	A section of principals, however, is unsure whether the infrastructure of the institutions would allow any increase in the seat count.         
	The government should have asked us to start preparations early, said the principal of a south Calcutta college. The colleges will have to compromise with quality if they are forced to admit more students without adequate upgrade in the facilities.         
	Calcutta University had already announced that its colleges would not be allowed to admit students beyond their sanctioned strength, which is decided on the basis of their infrastructure.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A couple returned from a holiday in the hills on Wednesday to find their two-storey house in Topsia burgled.         
	Pabitra Chatterjee and wife Jaya had left for Mussouri  where their daughter studies  on June 4. On Wednesday they reached Howrah station around 2pm and returned to their Mahendra Chatterjee Lane home by taxi.         
	The thieves smashed the locks of all the rooms and broke open two almirahs. They stole Rs 65,000 and jewellery worth more than Rs 1 lakh, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police (detective department).        
	The thieves entered the premises by scaling the boundary wall and then broke open the rear door, said an officer of Topsia police station.         
	A preliminary probe indicated that the robbers were from the locality or were tipped off by a local source.         
	The robbers knew there was no one in the house. They were in no hurry as they went on their looting spree from room to room, said another officer.

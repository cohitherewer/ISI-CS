The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Date with soccer storm
                                                                                                               Date with soccer storm
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	The IPL has been lost and won, the Aila has come and gone, and so soccer-mad Calcutta is ready for its midnight date with Manchester United.        
	Fingers were crossed over power and cable TV concerns on Tuesday with several pockets of the city going without electricity and some being denied satellite channels, but excitement over the Champions League final was peaking.        
	There is no electricity in my area since Monday afternoon. I cannot miss the final so I may have to go over to a friends place in the middle of the night, says Sabitra Banerjee, 21, a Phoolbagan resident.        
	The nightclubs are assuring uninterrupted viewing pleasure for fans of Ronaldo-Rooney or Messi-Henry. Screening the IPL matches didnt draw much crowds but this is going to be big: ManU vs Barcelona is a dream final, says Bunty Sethi of Privy, the Forum disc that has put up one big screen and three LCD TVs.        
	We had around 30 regulars calling us to ask if the match would be screened big, adds Vikram Puri of Plush, at The Astor, which will have two drop-down screens and three LCDs for a 360-degree view.        
	Adding a colour code is Shisha at 22 Camac Street. Wear red if youre supporting ManU and blue for Barcelona, says DJ Girish D.         
	But for those staying home and caught by a cable fault, theres online text and audio commentary to fall back on. I saw on Facebook that just for the big match we will get free commentary online. Or I can log on to www.manchesterunited.com and follow the match tracker, says 18-year old Debaleena Ghosh.

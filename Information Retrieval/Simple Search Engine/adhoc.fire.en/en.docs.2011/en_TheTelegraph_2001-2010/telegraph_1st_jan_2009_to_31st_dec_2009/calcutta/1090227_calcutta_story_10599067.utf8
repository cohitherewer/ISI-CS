                      Power of red                    One of the finest abstract painters in the world today, Sujata Bajaj specialises in works that derive their energy from her unique, characteristic line strokes. Immensely vibrant, each work, despite obvious similarities, stands distinct from others. Managing hues like red and black on the same canvas with dexterity, her paintings are stunning examples of what she calls line power. Reds, an exhibition of her latest works held in Paris, featured paintings in both mixed media and acrylic. Based on this series, Jean-Claude Carrieres book Sujata Bajaj traces the wide range of her works over the last five years. It describes Bajajs communication with a humane visual language that most people understand, with the use of colours. As the painter clarifies, I plan nothing. I follow my intuition and listen to the inner me. I let the colours live their own life and command their own language. Harmony transforms into warm red; an intense and positive energy. It is this energy that I hope the viewer will share with me. This evening, renowned poet Ashok Vajpeyi will formally launch the book.                    Event: Launch of Jean-Claude Carrieres book based on artist Sujata Bajajs exhibition, Reds When: Today at 7.30 pm Where: Sculpture Court, Indian Council for Cultural Relations, 9A Ho Chi Minh Sarani

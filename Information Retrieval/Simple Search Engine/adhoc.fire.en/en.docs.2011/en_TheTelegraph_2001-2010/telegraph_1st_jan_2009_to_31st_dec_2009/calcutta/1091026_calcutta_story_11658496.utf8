                      Art for a cause                    Leo Tolstoy once remarked, Art must have moral goodness and be connected to life. Good art must have a socially useful purpose and not just be a plaything in the hands of the rich.... All great art must thus be connected to a cause, or, in other words, serve as a tool for the greater good of society. Art Can Be ... For Giving, the ongoing group exhibition, fulfils this condition in a unique and very different way, as its proceeds will help generate funds for the uplift of the children of Development Action Society, a non-profit organisation working towards improving the lives of the underprivileged. The event showcases works of 16 artists and features a variety of figurative works, landscapes, abstracts and sculptures. Each work is unique in terms of colour, subject and medium, but shares a common platform with the others in being dedicated to a similar cause. Participants: Pinky Kenworthy, Shawn Kenworthy, Beena Pradhan, Shamik Paul, Keshav Roy, Rabin Mondal, Manik Khandar (a painting by him appears here) and others.

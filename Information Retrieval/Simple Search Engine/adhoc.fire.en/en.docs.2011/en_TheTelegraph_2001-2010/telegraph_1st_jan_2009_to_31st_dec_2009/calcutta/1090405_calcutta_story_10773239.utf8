  - Youngsters are teeing off from the citys fairways to blast into the national circuit

	2002: Arjun Atwal becomes the first Indian to win a European Tour event, landing the Caltex Singapore Masters title, sanctioned by the Asian and European tours.              
	2008: Shiv Shankar Prasad Chowrasia wins the inaugural Indian Masters, a part of the 08 European Tour.              
	What next? After Atwal and SSP, who literally grew up on the greens of the Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC), did the country proud in the international arena, the citys golfing fraternity believes Calcutta is on the cusp of more such milestones. The buoyancy stems from a clutch of bright-faced youngsters teeing off from the citys fairways and blasting into the national circuit.        
	They are also changing the demographics of the golf courses. The talent flourishes both in the slums and the skyscrapers, freeing the game a bit from the confines of the elite.        
	Its a balmy late-winter morning at the Royal, the worlds second-oldest golfing greens. Tutul Ali, a caddie boy, whose father repairs golf clubs, is perfecting his swing under the watchful gaze of coach Indrajit Bhalotia, who has to support Tutul with a monthly allowance.        
	The 12-year-old is at home in the company of the other young trainees in the programme, who go to high-end schools. Tutul, whose composure belies his age, won the All-India Under-13 nationals at the RCGC last December, beating all the top names in the country, one of the biggest golfing achievements by a Calcutta kid. The only other time a city kid won a national golf meet in the last two decades was when Rommel Mazumdar won the All-India Under-13 in 2005-06.        
	A few yards away from Tutul, honing his short game is Viraj Madappa, who just turned 11 and is one of the most exciting prospects. A Class VI student of Don Bosco Park Circus, Viraj notched up six second-place finishes in the last one year on the national circuit, with a very creditable score of 74 at the Golden Greens, Gurgaon.         
	Previously ranked India No. 2 in the under-11 (D) category, he has recently moved into the under-13 (C) group. Viraj is a natural and one of the most focused kids in his age group, says his coach, not missing a single training session, landing up at RCGC at 5.30am sharp, even in winter.

	The junior golf field in India is divided into four age groups by the Indian Golf Union, the national-level body for the sport. The kids graduate from under-11 (Category D) to under-13 (Category C), under 15 (B) and under-18 (A).        
	These are exceptionally talented kids poised to do Calcutta proud and bring more glory to the country. After a long time, we have a junior field thats pure class, says Bhalotia, former India No. 3 and a leading golf coach.        
	Watershed        
	The sudden surfeit of golf talent in the city is no flash in the pan, but the result of a structured grassroots initiative, says Gaurav Ghosh, a junior committee member of the golf union.        
	It started in late 2003/early 2004, a watershed for junior golf in Calcutta, when three grassroots programmes were launched back-to-back. RCGC and Tollygunge Club teed off two junior programmes and the Indian Golf Union organised its east zone programme to hone local talent. The results started to show from 2005-06. Divyangshu Bajaj became the first success story when he won the East India Juniors in the under-15 category. Akshay Butta was another exciting early prospect to emerge from the project.        
	Success feeds on success and in 2006, Surya Prakash became Indias top-ranked player in the under-18 boys category. Among the girls, Manvi Halwasya kept Calcuttas flag flying by winning the East India ladies meet with a record score, as a 17-year-old. All these tournaments are held under the aegis of the Indian Golf Union.        
	There was strong proof of a growing pool of talent in the city when eight juniors went to the US on golf scholarships in 2006. This created a temporary void back home for about a year and a half, till this fresh crop came through, says Bhalotia, at the heart of all the three colts programmes.        
	Now, there are almost 200 kids in the three junior schemes and another 12 at the Maidan open camp run by the city-based Protouch Golf Academy with the Calcutta Ladies Golf Club.        
	RCGC, the oldest golf club outside the British Isles, sunk a birdie to boost the boys when in 2005, it threw open its hallowed portals for non-members children to become part of its junior programme.         
	We realised the need to help initiate more youngsters into golf, for long weighed down by the stigma of being an elite sport, smiles M.M. Singh, the CEO of RCGC. Subsequently, Tolly did the same to support junior golf.         
	Calcutta had lost its top position to Delhi long ago. The slide started in the mid-Seventies, when corporate houses began to move out of town and Delhi wrested its top spot on the leader-board with a str-ing of world-class facilities.         
	Companies either shut shop or moved their headquarters out and with them a whole generation of golf-playing executives left Calcutta. Also, the Left Front came to power and sports in general was low-priority on its agenda, more so golf, recalls Ashit Luthra, president of Indian Golf Union and a former RCGC captain.        
	However, at the moment, the prospects of the juniors in Calcutta look brighter than ever, agrees Luthra. While Viraj, who hits the ball longer than most kids his age, is destined to go places, the coaches are confident Tutul can emulate and better the exploits of his older caddie colleagues  Samaresh Sardar, 21 and Raja Sardar, 20.        
	Parents perfect        
	With more avenues opening, today there are at least 70 kids from Calcutta trying to play at East India Amateurs. I dont remember anyone else from the city playing the national junior golf circuit during my time. Then there was Arjun (Atwal) and much later, Rahil (Gangjee), says Bhalotia.        
	Parents are also waking up to the potential of golf as a lucrative career option. Recently, parents of junior golfers formed a network to provide a support system to their wards. The Albatross, a voluntary organisation, was set up to promote competitive golf among juniors. The idea is to provide them with better exposure through more tournament play. We have already catalysed 10 junior meets across the country, says Virajs mother Vidya, who gave up a career in chartered accountancy to travel with her son to tournaments.        
	Tiger effect        
	How much of an inspiration have the Atwals and Shiv Shankar Prasad Chowrasias been to the new generation? Yes, there are home-grown icons to look up to now, but Bhalotia feels its still the Tiger effect thats drawing the kids in their droves.                  Tiger Woods      
	Tiger Woods has changed the notion of golf as an old mans game. He doesnt have a paunch, he has a six-pack. Hes charismatic and the way he has dominated the sport has hugely influenced the way children look at golf now, he said.        
	Television also played a role in bringing larger-than-life global stars to our drawing rooms. Young Kshitij Sehgal, training at RCGC since he was five, idolises Tiger Woods, while Viraj, focused on turning pro, wants to play shots like both Tiger and Phil Mickelson.        
	Increased opportunities mean you can get your kid started off for as little as Rs 450 a month. Still, there are only so many we can accommodate in the junior programmes, because Calcutta has only two-and-a-half courses, if you include the Calcutta Ladies Golf Club facility, laments Ghosh.                BIRDIE BOOST       2003-04: Three junior programmes tee off  2005-06: Divyangshu Bajaj wins the East India Juniors in the under-15 category  2005-06: Rommel Mazumdar wins the All-India under-13 meet  2006: Surya Prakash becomes India rsquo;s top-ranked player in the U-18 boys rsquo; category  2006: Manvi Halwasya wins the East India ladies rsquo; meet with a record score  2006: Eight juniors go to the US on golf scholarships  2008: Tutul Ali wins the All-India under-13 meet        
	Contrast that with the 16 golf courses in the National Capital Region and over 100 in south Indian cities.         
	Top city schools can play a greater role. While La Martiniere for Boys has a strong golf culture, only The Heritage School has greens and a practice net on campus. Protouch is trying to take golf to the top city schools, but the response hasnt been enthusiastic.         
	Unlike in north or south India, where the risk-taking appetite is bigger, in Calcutta, studies are always top priority. Most parents are not prepared to go the whole hog with any sport as a career option, said Bhalotia.        
	This is the reason why most kids dont hit a high at 13-14  they are too occupied with board exams. Coaches expect them to flower around age 20-21 instead. This late-blooming pattern could also change soon, with so much exposure and awareness among parents, feel golf experts.        
	Tiger Woods notwithstanding, SSPs Indian Masters exploits have fired the imagination of caddie boys like Tutul and Samaresh, and Atwal, another RCGC product, remains a hero among the citys budding golfers.         
	Just as Abhinav Bindra is unlikely to trigger a conveyor belt of shooting stars in his wake, theres a long way to go before there is a wave of golf.       SUBHRO SAHA

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Buddha talks clean, acts foul   Govt scripts petition to dodge auto deadline
                                                                                                               Buddha talks clean, acts foul     Govt scripts petition to dodge auto deadline
          TAPAS GHOSH AND JAYANTA BASU                                                  
	The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government is gearing up to duck yet another deadline to clean Calcuttas foul air.        
	While the chief minister kept his annual green tryst with World Environment Day, his officials were busy putting final touches to a petition seeking an extension of the high court deadline on the conversion of polluting two-stroke autorickshaws to four-stroke LPG from July 31, 2009, to January 1, 2010.        
	The petition, likely to be moved on Monday and heard by the green bench on Friday, refers to a few practical problems in enforcing the ban on two-stroke autos running on polluting fuel, especially the killer katatel.        
	If the plea is allowed, this will be the second instance within six months of the state administration breaking its promise to detoxify the citys poison air.        
	The first deadline it had missed was December 31, 2008, set by the environment department through a notification on July 17 and ratified by the court the next day. In January 2009, the transport department had made a mention in the court seeking more time to enforce the ban. The extension was granted and the deadline was stretched to July 31.        
	If the high court does not extend this deadline, the autos that have not applied for conversion would be declared illegal, transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury said.        
	So what is the governments excuse now? A litany of practical problems, as the draft petition states, including the time-consuming process in banks to disburse loans to auto owners to buy new vehicles, lack of a directive to auto operators to join the transfer scheme and inadequate LPG stations in the city.        
	A new LPG-run auto, from a manufacturer the government has tied up with, costs Rs 1,37,000. Under the exchange scheme, the manufacturer is to deduct Rs 15,000 and the government pays Rs 10,000 as subsidy. Banks will give Rs 1 lakh as loan.        
	Sources in the government said, of the 62,000 two-stroke autos in the city, only 19,168 have applied for the exchange. The last date for submitting application forms was June 5.         
	Around 2,000 applications are invalid, according to the petition. The rest are being forwarded to banks in batches.        
	The draft petition states the banks are not in a position to process so many applications and release the money in time for the government to meet the July 31 target.        
	Environment activist and clean-air petitioner Subhash Dutta rubbished the governments excuse. The applications could easily have been processed in a phased manner within the deadline. If the government was serious, it should have created a special cell for this.        
	The petition also pleads for an order to oil companies to set up enough LPG filling stations at the earliest, in the absence of which the ban could not be enforced. The city now has 13 LPG stations.        
	Why not utilise the existing stations before demanding more, asks the oil lobby. The utilisation of the 13 stations is below 20 per cent because there arent enough LPG vehicles. The state should focus on conversion of vehicles, said an Indian Oil official.        
	On pushing back the auto deadline, the government has an able ally in the Trinamul Congress. Sovandeb Chattopadhyay, the leader of the Trinamul-backed Auto Bachao Committee who met the transport secretary on Thursday, said: We will not submit any more applications as we hope to convince the court to allow the two-stroke autos to be fitted with LPG kits without converting to four stroke. If the court does not hear our petition and the government tries to crack down on autos after July 31, there will be a conflict.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Traffic was disrupted in several parts of the city on Wednesday afternoon as BJP supporters blocked key crossings between 1pm and 2pm to protest price rise and political violence in the state.        
	Commuters were inconvenienced though the blockades ended before the scheduled time as police dispersed the protesters.        
	Will blockades ever bring down prices? They only cause harassment, said Rajeev Das, who was caught in a jam at the CR Avenue-Ganesh Chandra Avenue crossing where the blockade continued for the longest duration, from 1pm to 1.24pm.        
	Traffic came to a standstill at the Hazra, CR Avenue-MG Road, Shyambazar five-point, CR Avenue-Ganesh Chandra Avenue, Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road-SN Banerjee Road and Manindra Road-BT Road crossings, as well as on Howrah Bridge.        
	We moved in quickly and arrested 157 people from different parts of the city, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police, headquarters. All were later granted bail.        
	Power cut: Power supply may be affected in Deshapriya Nagar, Graham Road, Tetultolla, Ariadaha, Haladhar Bose Road, Mackenzie Road, Nilgunge Road, Basudebpur, Sreepally, Kamarhati, Bantala, Panihati, Mollahat and Laha Bagan, on the northern fringes of the city, between 9am and 1pm on Thursday because of maintenance work by CESC.        
	Theft: A white Ambassador car (WB04B 1980) was stolen from Kalighat Road on Tuesday. Police suspect a local gang was behind the theft.        
	Blaze: A fire broke out in front of the warehouse of Khadims at Marcus Square around 1.18pm on Wednesday afternoon. Four tenders rushed to the spot and put out the blaze around 1.55pm.

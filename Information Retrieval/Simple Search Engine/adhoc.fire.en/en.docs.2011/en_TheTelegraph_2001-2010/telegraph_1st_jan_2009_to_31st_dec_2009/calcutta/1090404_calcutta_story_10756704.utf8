The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mixed menu replaces Bolly diet   Mind the Bolly gap
                                                                                                               Mixed menu replaces Bolly diet   Mind the Bolly gap
  - Screens scramble for Holly-Tolly-IPL combo in producer-plex showdown          PRIYANKA ROY                          HOLLY HOOK: Kate Winslet in The Reader                                        
	Kate Winslets Oscar role, Anjan Dutts next film and the Kolkata Knight Riders first match  Hollywood, Tollywood and cricket may well be on the movie menu for a month in a city hooked to a Bollywood-only diet.        
	With the nation-wide row between film producers and exhibitors over revenue-sharing terms reaching the April 4 deadline, the threat of no more Bollywood releases this month is now a reality.        
	Producers are demanding a 50 per cent revenue share for every film that releases; we feel the profit-sharing model should be driven by the nature and performance of a film, says Alok Tandon, the COO of INOX.        
	With neither side ready to blink first  and the IPL-2 schedule ensuring that big Bolly films are being pushed back anyway  city cinemas are busy making other plans. Alternative forms of entertainment, big-ticket Hollywood releases and regional film content will be the three-in-one formula to fill in the Bolly blank.        
	But even the Holly-Tolly-IPL combo will fail to fill the larger-than-life shoes of Bollywood. Hindi films  big or small  are by far the biggest crowd pullers in Calcutta, says a multiplex official.        
	Unlike Aa Dekhen Zara that released last Friday at only single screen theatres, April will see both multiplexes and standalone cinemas tarred by the same blackout brush.                                
	Film distributors are largely siding with the film producers. Bypassing a plex and releasing a film only at a single-screen theatre is a losing proposition. Therefore the decision is not to release Bollywood films at all till the issue is resolved, says Mahendra Soni of Shree Venkatesh Films.                  BOLLY CRICKET:Shah Rukh Khan      
	Even if we incur losses, the issue should be resolved once and for all. Besides, April doesnt really have a big Bolly release, adds Debashish De of Kapurchand Films whose Shortkut and Life Partner, scheduled to release during the strike, have now been postponed.        
	If the INOX plexes at City Centre and Forum have tied up with NDTV Lumiere for a world cinema retrospective this month, then every Friday in April will witness the release of Oscar biggies like The Reader, Revolutionary Road and Milk at the citys seven plexes.        
	We also plan to go big with Tollywood releases like Kaaler Rakhal and Chowrasta-Crossroads of Love, besides a couple of other Bangla films, says Virendra Marya, the regional director of INOX. There are even plans to play Tamil and Telugu blockbusters to draw in crowds.        
	The loud shout to beat the Bollywood lull  if things work out  will be the live screening of IPL-2 matches, the heady combo of cricket-meets-Bollywood.        
	But the latest buzz underlines the importance of Bollywood in cinemas  a re-release of Aamir Khans Ghajini if the ban persists.              
	REVENUE SHARING NOW        
	Determined by the banner and the performance of a film. Varies from film to film and week to week              
	WHO WANTS WHAT         
	Film producers want a flat 50 per cent revenue share across all weeks for every big and small film. Multiplexes want to continue with the earlier revenue-sharing model

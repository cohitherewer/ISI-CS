                      Reaching for the stars                    At 21, Deen is dismayed by the poverty around him and trapped in negativity. Alienated from family and society, heroin is his drug of choice. Along with his partner-in-crime AJ, he rides high on acid and amphetamines, philosophises in the university canteen, parties at a politicians posh pad and contemplates God at a roadside tea stall. From Maria, a chemically-imbalanced diva, to a rickshaw-puller who reflects on the importance of optimism, to a group of fakirs who sing about love and a detective who has his own take on addiction, the characters in like a diamond in the sky, Shazia Omars debut novel, crackle with life. They represent the despair, hopes and aspirations of a generation struggling to survive the harsh realities of life in modern Dhaka. Hard-hitting and intensely-moving, this is an extraordinary novel, and one that promises to launch Omar as a major contemporary voice from south Asia. This evening, Starmark, in collaboration with Penguin Books India and Zubaan, hosts the launch of the book. To be followed by a conversation between Kavita Punjabi and the author.                  Event: Launch of Shazia Omars novel like a diamond in the sky When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Starmark, 3 Lord Sinha Road

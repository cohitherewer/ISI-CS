The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Saturday night minus the fever
                                                                                                               Saturday night minus the fever
  - Two popular nightclubs face the blues with bars forced shut for a fortnight          OUR BUREAU                          Young patrons forced to make do with mocktails at Venom on Saturday night. Picture by Rashbehari Das                                        
	Saturday, post-midnight. The stretch of road outside 22 Camac Street has no cars jostling for a place to park. The elevator that leads up to the fifth floor has no PYTs (pretty young things) in mini skirts and backless tops giggling and tapping their feet, eager to break into dance. As you step out of the elevator, the reason for the silence and the emptiness becomes clear  Shisha is shut.        
	The popular nightclub has been barred from serving liquor for a fortnight by the excise department. On March 28, there was an excise check around 2.20am. We had stopped serving liquor at the stipulated time of 2am but some guests from a post-wedding party had lingered in the lounge with their drinks in hand, said Arvind Bhatnagar, the director (operations) of PDK Shenaz Pvt Ltd, the company which owns Shisha.        
	On April 6, the party address was slapped with a 15-day suspension notice for flouting the liquor deadline. The management has appealed for a relaxation but decided to keep the place shut till the spirits are allowed to flow again.        
	Another party address down the road facing a similar rap has, however, decided to keep the music playing while going dry for a fortnight. There was a raid and the bar was open a little beyond the stipulated closing time. So they have sealed the bar for 15 days, said Bunty Sethi of Venom. Some Venom regulars are still dropping in but it is business unusual. On Saturday, the dance floor was crowded, but the bar was desolate. For once, we are hanging out with mocktails or cola in hand, laughed a party regular.        
	On Friday night we had a 300-strong crowd, but with the bar closed, business was less than Rs 5,000. We are sending some of our patrons to Privy (the lounge at Forum), but we are keeping Venom open, added Sethi.        
	Excise rules allow standalone nightclubs to keep the bar open till 2am on weekends while the ones in hotels can serve it till 4am. The great divide was most visible on Saturday night with the crowds spilling over at party places like Roxy at The Park and Underground at Hotel Hindusthan International. This place is so crowded tonight because Shisha is closed, said Pratap Daryanani, a Shisha regular partying in Roxy.        
	The standalone nightclubs are now straining at the leash of their liquor deadline. The trend in Calcutta is that people come to a nightclub well after midnight. How can we expect them to wrap up by 2am? demanded Sethi.        
	A peeved youngster on Camac Street summed up the mood among the citys lounge regulars: Calcutta is way behind the other metros on every entertainment count but it had at least gained the reputation of partying the longest. Now, even that will be gone.

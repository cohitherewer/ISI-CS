The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Breathalysers many, brakes few
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Breathalysers many, brakes few
  - Easy passage for drink driving as policing remains lax          OUR BUREAU                                                  
	Calcutta police have acquired new breathalysers for their drive against drink driving this festive season but tipplers taking the wheel after downing more than the permitted peg could find the punishment too tame.        
	Come Thursday, cops armed with breathalysers will be deployed outside star hotels and popular restaurants on Park Street and elsewhere to catch drivers with more than 30mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood.        
	The policing here is too lenient. Offenders can get away with little or no punishment, which is why law-enforcing agencies in Delhi and Mumbai have launched a sustained drive, said a retired police officer.         
	The punishment is prosecution under Section 185 of the Motor Vehicles Act, under which an offender is asked to deposit Rs 2,000 with the police as bond before being granted bail. If the court later orders a lesser fine, the balance amount is returned to the person. The letter of the law states that anyone guilty of drink driving is fined Rs 2,000 and/or imprisoned for six months. A second offence within three years makes the driver liable for up to three years in prison or a fine of Rs 3,000, or both.        
	But unlike Delhi or Mumbai, the city police have failed to curb drink driving. That promises to change this week, claim top cops. The deputy commissioner of city police (traffic), Dilip Banerjee, said his team would be stricter than before this festive season, armed with adequate number of breathalysers. The traffic department has procured 15 new breathalysers.              
	A senior police officer said the crackdown on drink driving in Mumbai had yielded better results than in Calcutta as much for the high rate of conviction as for more stringent punishment.        
	Mumbai police has lodged over 40,420 cases since launching a drive on June 28, 2007. Harish Baijal, the then deputy commissioner (traffic) who is credited with the success of the drive, told Metro from Nasik that ruthlessness was the key.         
	We sustained the drive. On an average, 250 constables and 50 to 60 inspectors would be engaged. I spent nearly 180 nights during the two-year period on the road, he said.        
	Are our top cops listening?

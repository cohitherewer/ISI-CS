                      Mind over matter                    The decade and a half in which Beena Pradhan has been actively painting as a self-taught artist has seen a quiet evolution from pure portraiture and the capturing of the Indian moodscape to a stronger, more philosophical exploration of the moiety of the feminine psyche juxtaposed with the morphed male. The non-formal route in her artistic career is what has given Beenas work a dimension that has gone beyond the trappings of studious Gothic into an uncharted rococo. In her last Form and Sound series, her lusty street musicians made music side by side with introspective men and women. The taut sepia-toned bodies of the latter blended with the cobalt blue receding males, and her paintings started to burst with primary colour backgrounds and bold daubs of passion. These colours have taken on even more definitive mannerisms in Pradhans current Rangeen series, on display at the ongoing show of her paintings. The brash blues and ravishing reds co-exist with new tones and mutated changes in temperament. Her transformational faces now have a musical timbre, dashes of primary tones that deliberately change to establish the cyclic intrigues and impertinences of the mind.                  Event: An exhibition of paintings by Beena Pradhan When: September 1 - 6; 4 pm - 8 pm Where: Birla Academy of Art amp; Culture, 108 Southern Avenue

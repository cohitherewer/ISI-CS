The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Wanted: innovators from science nursery 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Wanted: innovators from science nursery 
          PRASUN CHAUDHURI                                    
	Indias biotech industry is expected to grow into a $15 billion industry in the next five years and the citys young researchers can play an important role in the boom, concluded a three-day meet organised by the National Academy of Sciences, India (NASI).         
	The city had been a nursery of Indian science and its the time to recreate that era, said scientist M.G.K. Menon, an honorary fellow of the academy, at its 79th annual symposium held at Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, Gol Park.         
	The city has been integral to the academy, the oldest science academy in the country, founded by Meghnad Saha who believed in application of science for the improvement of society, added NASI president Asis Datta, a geneticist.         
	The country needs at least a 100,000 scientists in the next few years and the citys talent pool can be a significant contributor, said Virander S. Chauhan, a vaccine researcher. Chauhan said the city contributes a sizeable part of the countrys PhDs in the basic sciences.         
	Rich tradition of science in Bengal still inspires students to plunge into postgraduate research in science forsaking high-paying jobs in information technology or engineering, added Menon. According to him, the inherent creativity in the young in the city can go a long way in furthering Indian science, which badly needs innovators. India has been good at reverse engineering, but now its time for some original work if we have to stay ahead the US or China in the race of science, said biologist G. Padmanaban.         
	We should seek more private-public partnership and shake all inhibitions regarding genetically modified crops in order to feed billions of Indians, he added.        
	Modified crops with enhanced nutrients or vaccines in the midday meal schemes can solve the problem of malnutrition, said Datta. Genetics can also prevent post-harvest spoilage and increase food productivity, added Rakesh Tuli, the director of the National Botanical Research Institute in Lucknow.         
	According to Manju Sharma, the former head of biotechnology, its not just scientific research, biotechnology can offer self-employment and entrepreneurship opportunities to thousands. This sector can employ a lot of women too, said Sharma. She mentioned the rich tradition of scientific research by Calcuttas women scientists, led by the late geneticist, Archana Sharma.         
	Samir Bhattacharya, the former head of Calcuttas Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, rued the lack of industries to support local talent by providing career options.         
	Naturally, our talented youngsters shift base to other states. We need a strong academia-industry interface in our educational institutes to nurture talent, he added.

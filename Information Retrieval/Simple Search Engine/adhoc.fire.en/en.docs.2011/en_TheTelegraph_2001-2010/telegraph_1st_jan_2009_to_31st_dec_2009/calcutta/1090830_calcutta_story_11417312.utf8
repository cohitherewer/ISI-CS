The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Goodbye to long queues
                                                                                                               Goodbye to long queues
										      Autumn Flush                        
	Some years ago when I had just opened an account at a new bank, I was waiting at a tellers queue, a long snaky line that curled around on itself. This makes my feet and back hurt, makes me hot and irritable. I flexed my back, stood first on one foot then on the other and felt I was going to be late for a class at the university. Almost within seconds the grahak mitra of the bank came up to me and asked if I had an ATM card.         
	I had one but hadnt used it yet. He took me to the ATM outside the bank and demonstrated the use of the card. This of course would not have been necessary for GenX or Y; it was for me.        
	I was delighted with this new spot of learning and it has saved me on many occasions since. This is also true for the credit card that I have used for a longer time. While frauds are reported from time to time, both credit cards and the Automated Teller Machines are a necessary evil. I have withdrawn money at the latter at the dead of night during a medical emergency and in the middle of nowhere (green fields on either side of a narrow highway). The nickname Any Time Money is appropriate.         
	The credit card is useful for two jobs: the buying of railway and airline tickets ahead of a journey. Since I learnt how to do these on the Internet, I have to remind myself of calculating how long it would be before it was my turn at the top of hot and sweaty queues.        
	On the computer one can go to sites for airline tickets such as makemytrip.com or cleartrip.com, key in ones requirements and see a table of timings and tariffs for the dates. Keep your credit card handy. You will be required to fill in the extra numbers on the back of the card. Keep details of the persons travelling ready too. You dont want to stop and think of how old your spouse or child is. There are slots for every detail you fill in and the process is idiot-proof. Print the ticket out carefully. You need Java software for that (it is a free download from the Internet).        
	The Indian Railways booking site is even more user-friendly. They immediately credit the money back into your bank or credit card account in case of cancellation with a minimal cancellation charge. Travel agents use the same sites.         
	With ticket print-outs, you must carry a photo ID when making the journey, like a passport, PAN card or a voter ID. Happy journeys!

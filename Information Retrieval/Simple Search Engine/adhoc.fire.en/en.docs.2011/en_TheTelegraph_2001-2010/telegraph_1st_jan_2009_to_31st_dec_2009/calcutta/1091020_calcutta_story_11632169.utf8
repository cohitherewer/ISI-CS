The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Trainees to help IIM teachers 
                                                                                                               Trainees to help IIM teachers 
          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	The Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta, has taken a page out of its own curriculum and introduced the post of trainee teaching associates to help its teachers manage their time better. The B-school wants to ease the load on its faculty members so that they can concentrate more on research and on improving teaching standards.        
	There is a tremendous demand on faculty time, especially with the increase in the number of students. So we have introduced the post of teaching associate this year, said Prashant Mishra, the chairman of the postgraduate programme at IIM Calcutta.        
	The institute has taken in more than 20 teaching associates who have a masters degree with first class marks.         
	There are various aspects of teaching that take up a teachers time, which any qualified person can do. That is what the associates are expected to do, said Mishra.        
	The teaching associates have annual contracts, which can be renewed, with a monthly salary of Rs 18,000 to Rs 22,000, depending on qualification.        
	A teaching associates job will include researching curricula before a course launch, preparing presentations, assisting in setting question papers, correcting answer scripts and evaluating students. The associates will, however, not be allowed to teach at the institute.        
	The concept of teaching assistants is not new to Indian educational institutions. Even in IIM Calcutta, doctoral students double as teaching assistants, but that depends on availability. The posts of teaching associates would be permanent.        
	While the main purpose was to reduce the workload of faculty members, the move is also an attempt by the institute to encourage students to opt for higher studies. The teaching associates will have access to our library and will attend classes. They can even take up any two courses of their choice at the institute, for which they will get certificates, said Mishra.        
	For teaching associates, this is an opportunity to find out if academics is their cup of tea. Archana Sethia, one of the newly recruited associates at IIM Calcutta who has a masters degree in economics from Presidency College, said the opportunity would help her decide whether to do a Phd or take up a job. I will get a taste of what to expect after I do my PhD. I can also find out if I am cut out for research, she said.

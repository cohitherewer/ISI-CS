	The ceasework started by junior doctors at Chittaranjan National Medical College and Hospital on Monday was withdrawn on Tuesday evening after the authorities assured them of adequate security.         
	The house staff and interns had alleged they were manhandled by relatives of a patient who died on Sunday. They demanded proper manning of entrances of the emergency and other wards and not allowing more than two relatives of a patient to enter the wards.

                                                                                                               Foreign flights in fare cut
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	International airfare from the city has hit an all-time low with airlines trying to beat the downturn by ferrying tourists during the summer holiday.         
	Singapore Airlines on Friday reduced fares on a number of sectors to almost half. Industry watchers believe other airlines would follow suit, thus offering a bonanza to holiday travellers.        
	After the fare cut, a return ticket to Singapore from the city on Singapore Airlines will cost Rs 11,000 including taxes.        
	The airlines existing return fare between Calcutta and the island state is around Rs 23,000.        
	Passengers wanting to avail themselves of the low fare will have to book their tickets between May 25 and May 29. The fare will be valid till September 30.         
	For China, Australia and the US, bookings under reduced fares will have to be made between May 25 and June 12. The fares will be valid till September 30.        
	The airline is offering return fare of Rs 22,000 to China, Rs 25,000 to Perth, Rs 36,000 to Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane and Melbourne and Rs 45,000 to the US. The fares are inclusive of taxes. Those flying to Australia, the US and China through Singapore can stay on the island by paying $1.         
	Equally exciting fares to other exciting destinations will be announced over the next couple of weeks, said C.W. Foo, the general manager (India) of Singapore Airlines.         
	According to travel industry sources, fall in the number of passengers prompted the fare cut. Singapore Airlines passenger count went down significantly after travel agents boycotted the airline as it was not ready to pay commission, said Anil Punjabi, the chairman (east) of the Travel Agents Federation of India.        
	Low-cost carrier Air India Express is not increasing its return fare of Rs 15,000 (including taxes) to Singapore in the peak season so that the passenger count does not fall. The low fare is meant to attract budget tourists. All our flights to Singapore in the coming weeks are almost fully booked, said a spokesperson for Air India Express.        
	Emirates airline, which connects Calcutta to Dubai is offering a free return ticket for a child below 16 years along with tickets for two paying adults.        
	As part of the offer, valid from May 15 to September 20, two children under 16 will be offered free accommodation and meals in Dubai. The children also wont have to pay entrance fee at select tourist spots in Dubai.

Police said the trailer was flung off under the impact of the collision but its driver managed to flee. The driver of the train sustained a minor leg injury. Some overhead equipment was damaged, leading to suspension of services on Southeastern Railways Howrah-Amta route. The local train was tugged away by a diesel engine.

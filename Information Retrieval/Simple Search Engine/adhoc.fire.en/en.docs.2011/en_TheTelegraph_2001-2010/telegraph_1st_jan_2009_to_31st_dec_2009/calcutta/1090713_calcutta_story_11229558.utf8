The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Govt staff flee good hospitals
                                                                                                               Govt staff flee good hospitals
          SANJAY MANDAL                          Get real: Surjya Kanta Mishra                                  
	The good service that government hospitals are giving  according to health minister Surjya Kanta Mishras definition in the Assembly last week  is certainly not good enough for government employees.        
	Ask Manas Pal, a 33-year-old employee of the state governments water resource investigation and development department, who had admitted his 76-year-old father Lakshmi Narayan Pal to SSKM Hospitals medicine department following a cerebral stroke on June 5. When his father suffered a second stroke earlier this month and required critical care, Manas headed straight for Ruby General Hospital, instead.        
	The quality of doctors is very good at SSKM but patient care is terrible. The nurses hardly attended to my father and the Group D staff members were so callous, alleged Manas. My dependants and I will only go to private hospitals for treatment and avoid state-run hospitals even in an emergency.        
	What has changed between June and July? The West Bengal Health Scheme 2008, enabling state government employees to avail treatment at private hospitals, has come into effect on July 1.        
	The Telegraph had reported on March 29 how the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government  in the most severe self-indictment of its healthcare system  had drawn up a scheme for its employees to receive subsidised treatment at private hospitals.         
	This has allowed the likes of Manas Pal to escape the horrors of state-run hospitals that lakhs of ordinary citizens are forced to suffer every day.        
	But that didnt stop state health minister Mishra from standing up against a Trinamul Congress legislator in the Assembly on July 7 and proclaiming: The overcrowding in state-run hospitals, with two to three patients in one bed, is testimony to the good service being rendered by such facilities. You are saying patients are lying on the floor. There are two-three patients in one bed. Hospitals are getting overcrowded. From this, it is clear that patients are going to government hospitals because of the service they get. They get good service. Thats why they are going there.        
	Wake up and smell the stink at any of the good state-run hospitals, Honble Minister. Or just listen to what your governments employees have to say.        
	The care and facilities at private hospitals are so much better than the state-run hospitals. In fact, there is no comparison, said Akhilesh Saha, an employee of the state labour department, who took his wife Rituparna to a private hospital in south Calcutta, where she gave birth to a baby girl on July 2.        
	Thanks to the new health scheme, most employees are now unwilling to go to state-run hospitals because of lack of patient care, added Saha.        
	Private hospitals are already cashing in on the scheme allowing government employees an escape route. We are flooded with queries from government employees about treatment. We are expecting at least a 20 per cent increase in the number of patients in the coming months, said Brig (retd) S.B. Purkayastha, the CEO of Ruby General Hospital.        
	Patients under the scheme have already started taking admissions and coming to the OPD, said Rupak Barua, the chief operating officer of Calcutta Medical Research Institute (CMRI).        
	The health minister, of course, continues to believe that patients are going to state-run hospitals out of choice, rather than compulsion.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Suchitra tax row in court
                                                                                                               Suchitra tax row in court
  - Appellate body asked to hear screen legend through counsel          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                                              Suchitra Sen    
	Suchitra Sen has moved the high court alleging that the income tax department has unfairly slapped a wealth-tax demand on her without hearing her appeal.        
	Justice Indira Banerjee, who heard the case on Wednesday, ordered the income tax appellate tribunal to allow the reclusive screen legend to present her case through her counsel and pass an order within eight weeks.         
	The tribunal is directed to give a hearing to the counsel of Suchitra Sen before assessing the valuation of her property and her income from it, Justice Banerjee said.         
	Sens counsel Shibendu Basu said: We hope justice will finally be done.         
	According to Basu, the income tax department had slapped the former actress with tax dues of Rs 30,57,930 in 2005, based on the valuation of her property on Ballygunge Circular Road.         
	Responding to the notice, Sen had prayed for a revision of the valuation before the assistant commissioner of wealth tax. Her counsel had submitted before the assistant commissioner that his client should pay a lower rate of tax since the property was not properly assessed.         
	But the assistant commissioner ruled that no revision was called for as the valuation and the assessment made on the basis of it were correct.         
	Sen approached the commissioner of wealth tax, appealing against the assistant commissioners order. The commissioner heard her case and on March 31, 2008, passed an order refusing to modify the ruling.         
	This prompted Sen to move the appellate tribunal of the income tax department. But on April 20 this year, the tribunal refused to hear the case and dismissed her counsels prayer.         
	Sens counsel then moved the high court. In her petition filed before the court, the actress made the commissioner and the assistant commissioner of wealth tax and the appellant tribunal of the income tax department respondents to the case. The court on Wednesday set aside the order passed by the commissioner of income tax last year.         
	Sources said that in 1991 the actress entered into an agreement with a developer on her house on Ballygunge Circular Road.

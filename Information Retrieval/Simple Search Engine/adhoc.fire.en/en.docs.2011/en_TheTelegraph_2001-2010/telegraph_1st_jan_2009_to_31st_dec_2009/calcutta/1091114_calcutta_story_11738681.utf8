          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A 29-year-old investment consultant was arrested in her Behala home on Friday for siphoning off Rs 62 lakh from the accounts of the share trading company where she worked.         
	Papiya Rozario joined the Jorasanko office of the company last year. The owner, Ganga Ram, is old and ailing and let her look after the companys finances. Over months, he realised that she transferring money from the companys accounts to her own, said a senior officer of the anti-fraud wing of the detective department.         
	We are not certain how much Papiya had siphoned off in a year. It could just be the tip of the iceberg, added the officer.        
	Ganga Ram lodged a complaint with the detective department in March 2009, accusing Papiya of misappropriating nearly Rs 62 lakh. According to investigators, she also transferred profit-making shares owned by clients to her name.         
	When questioned about discrepancies in accounts, Papiya allegedly told Ganga Ram that clients had defaulted on payments.

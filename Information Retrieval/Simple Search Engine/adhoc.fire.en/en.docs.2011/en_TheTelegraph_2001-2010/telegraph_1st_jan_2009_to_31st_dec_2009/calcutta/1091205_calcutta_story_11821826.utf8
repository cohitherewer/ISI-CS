The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rake runs with lethal flaw
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rake runs with lethal flaw
  - Passenger load, maintenance lack compromise Metro safety          SANJAY MANDAL                                    
	Metro Railways dalliance with danger continues with a recent discovery that a rake had been running with a damaged component that holds a coach together.        
	Sources said two central pivots of a coach of rake B6 were found to be severely damaged. The snag  which can result in a coach being dislodged  was noticed by maintenance workers at Metro Railways Noapara carshed at night about two weeks ago.        
	The pivot was then taken off the coach as a safety measure and replaced. Since some of the rakes have become old, such snags do occur but repairs are carried out at once, a Metro official said on Friday.        
	But sources said trains running with damaged pivots was a major compromise of safety as pivots, placed on both ends of a coach, hold it together.        
	If the pivot is damaged, an official added, a coach can be dislodged, although there is an axle. It must be replaced immediately to avert an accident, he pointed out.        
	Metro sources said the coach in question was very old, dating back to pre-1984. All such coaches need to be replaced at once, they said.        
	Rakes have been groaning under the pressure of the extended stretch since August. Apart from being old, they have to carry passengers far beyond their capacity, said an official. A rake has the load-bearing capacity of around 2,500 passengers on each journey. But after the opening of the Tollygunge-Garia Bazar section, the passenger count has gone up by 30 per cent.        
	That, coupled with the delay in getting new rakes, has overburdened the existing trains, especially during peak hours. This is resulting in frequent snags, said an official.        
	Out of 18 rakes, 17 have been pressed into service to maintain the timetable. This means the daytime maintenance of trains has been all but scrapped. So, the pivot problem could not be detected during the day, said a source.        
	The lack of daytime maintenance and added passenger pressure  both caused by the route extension  has lowered Metros safety standards.        
	Thirteen rakes are slated to be added to the present 18. The Railway Board recently sanctioned 14 more rakes. Once all the rakes arrive, 11 of the old rakes will be discarded, said an official.        
	The other tech trouble ailing Metro is the malfunctioning of smart card turnstiles, with stations on the new stretch being forced to shut them down for repairs from Wednesday evening. The new smart card system will be installed within seven months, said an official.

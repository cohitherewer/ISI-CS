The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Kidney trail leads to Chennai boss
                                                                                                               Kidney trail leads to Chennai boss
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Manik Chowdhury, arrested recently in the Sunderbans on the suspicion of running the multi-state kidney racket, had allegedly been working for a Chennai-based man since 2005.         
	In his mid-40s, the man, police claimed, is associated with a top hospital in Chennai. He met Chowdhury when the latter sold one of his kidneys in Chennai for Rs 1 lakh and the two have been working together since.        
	The investigators are also looking for Kaushik Mullick, a resident of Nababgunj in Ichhapore, North 24-Parganas. He allegedly drove Chowdhury from his residence in Delhi to Basanti in South 24-Parganas in a Santro after they heard of the arrest of key racket member Chandana Mukherjee on February 2.        
	Mullick appears to have negotiated several deals for Chowdhury, said an officer.         
	According to the police, Chandana was arrested when Chowdhury and Mullick were arranging for the treatment of her only son Raja after he met with an accident.        
	The investigation has also revealed that Mullick was close to Chandanas sister Mridula, who had been arrested in connection with the racket.        
	The investigators have sought more details from three private hospitals in the city about organ transplants between 2006 and 2008.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | JU raze report on blaze building
                                                                                                               JU raze report on blaze building
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                              
	The civil engineering department of Jadavpur University (JU) has advised the Calcutta Municipal Corporation to demolish the entire structure of Nandaram Market beyond the fifth floor.         
	The 10-page report, which was submitted to municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay on Monday, recommends demolition of the top six floors to ensure structural stability of the building in Burrabazar.        
	Nandaram Market, which houses one of the biggest cloth and tailoring items markets in the city, caught fire on January 12, 2008 and the flames could be doused only after 100 hours of fire fighting.         
	All the floors beyond the fifth floor of the Nandaram Market are illegal and are required to be demolished to honour the high court order. We have been waiting for the report as the structural stability of the building was in question, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.        
	In 1988, the high court had declared the floors above the fifth floor of the Nandaram Market  which was G-plus-23  illegal. The civic body should have pulled down all the illegal floors but it demolished floors 13 to 23. We could demolish only the top floors because they were vacant. But other illegal floors were occupied by traders, said Gora Chand Mondal, the director general (building).        
	The JU report  prepared by a team led by Somnath Ghosh, professor of civil engineering  has given the go-ahead for reconstruction till the ninth floor (roof level of eight floor) after demolition of the top floors following strict specifications.        
	The civic body is in no mood to act as the traders body is opposed to the demolition. We will not allow pulling down of any floor. Around 500 traders will suffer, said Samar Chowdhury, the general secretary of the Nandaram Market disaster management welfare committee.        
	We will decide on the future course of action after discussions with the police, fire brigade and the government, said municipal commissioner Bandyopadhyay.

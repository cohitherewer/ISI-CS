The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A close look at North-East 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      A close look at North-East

	A wet Monday evening is hardly the ideal time for a book launch. Particularly if it happens to be at the British Council on Camac Street that can get flooded even after a drizzle. But it was full house at the launch of Subir Bhaumiks Troubled Periphery, Crisis of Indias North-East.         
	Former BBC correspondent Mark Tully was present to do the honours. He described Bhaumiks work as not a journalistic book, nor is it an academic book though it has a sizeable number of endnotes but a book written from experience on the troubles of the North-East for the general readership.         
	He said it was not lack of development that was the cause of insurgency there. Development money was spent on a bloated bureaucracy and a corrupt government. Rajiv Gandhi said 80 per cent of the funds were lost before they reached the target while his son Rahul said of each rupee spent on development, only five paise reached the people.        
	Author Bhaumik said: North-East is a part of India that looks more and more like the highland societies of South East China. Unless the central government undergoes a radical change in its mindset, it will not be able to tackle the problems there.        
	 Correction: The report Dark deeds, dated November 15, should have said the book reading took place at Crossword, Elgin Road. The error is regretted.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Humidity is the horror
                                                                                                               Humidity is the horror
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	After four days of 40-plus (or a shade minus), the mercury dipped to 37.3 degrees Celsius on Wednesday, a degree above normal, but the city sweltered as the discomfort index remained an oppressive 12 degrees above normal.        
	The high minimum relative humidity of 58 per cent was to blame.        
	Calcutta experienced an unusually sultry day with the maximum relative humidity touching 87 per cent and the minimum not dipping below 58 per cent, said a senior official of the Alipore Met office.        
	The maximum temperature dipped from 40 degrees Celsius to 37.3 degrees, but the minimum relative humidity rose from 40 to 58 on Wednesday. So the discomfort index read 67 degrees Celsius, marginally less than Tuesdays 68.        
	The last time the minimum humidity refused to dip below the 50 per cent mark on an April day with no rainfall was in 1995.        
	There was no rain on Wednesday and the minimum temperature was four degrees above normal, at 29.2 degrees Celsius. The forecast? The heat wave-like conditions persisting for at least another 24 hours in south Bengal.        
	The hot, dry northwesterlys are still blowing in from central and north India, resulting in heat wave-like conditions over south Bengal. Temperatures dipped in Calcutta on Wednesday because of some cloud cover in and around the city in the morning, the weatherman said.        
	The sapping heat on Wednesday can be explained by the human body using evaporative cooling as the primary mechanism to regulate temperature. Under humid conditions the rate of perspiration evaporating from the skin is less, causing the discomfort index to rise.        
	Thursday will also be sultry and uncomfortable, warned the weatherman.

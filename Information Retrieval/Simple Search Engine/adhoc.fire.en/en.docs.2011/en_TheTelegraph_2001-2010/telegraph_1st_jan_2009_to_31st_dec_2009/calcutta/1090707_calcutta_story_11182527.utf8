The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 2-boss plan for Lalbazar
                                                                                                               2-boss plan for Lalbazar
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Too much on his plate? Police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti                                   
	The city police will soon have a special commissioner who will oversee routine administrative matters that are now looked after by the commissioner.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who is also in charge of the home department, agreed in principle to create the post at a recent meeting with senior officials, including chief secretary Ashok Mohan Chakrabarti and home secretary Ardhendu Sen.        
	The force had a special commissioner  S.N. Sarkar held the post  from September to December last year. The government wants to reintroduce the post.        
	Sources said the government wanted a special commissioner to relieve the commissioner of the task of overseeing routine administrative matters so he could focus more on policing.        
	With the civic elections slated for next year, to be followed by Assembly polls in 2011, policing acquires prime importance, an officer said.         
	That is why the government is considering handing over routine administrative matters to an officer of the same rank who will take decisions independently, the officer added.        
	The special commissioner will monitor vigilance cases and other legal matters and prepare answers to questions related to the force that are raised in Parliament and the Assembly.         
	The officer will also look into administrative matters such as budget, pension, leave of assistant commissioners and inspectors, community policing and the Dial 100 (helpline) service.        
	Sources said the home department had zeroed in on a senior IPS officer  recently promoted to the rank of additional director-general  for the post.        
	A section of officers, however, questioned the move to appoint a special commissioner at a time when the government decided to scrap the post of director-general of police (coordination), which was set up to relieve the director-general of police of routine work.        
	The government has also decided to appoint an IPS officer of the rank of inspector-general of police as special secretary (home), who will deal with issues related to the state and city police.

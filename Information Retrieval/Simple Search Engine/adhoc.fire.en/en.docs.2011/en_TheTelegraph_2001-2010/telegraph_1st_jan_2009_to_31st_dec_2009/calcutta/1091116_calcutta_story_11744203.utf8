          RITH BASU                          Anxious parents at the school gate with the new name on Sunday. (Aranya Sen)                                  
	Hartleys High School has suddenly become Hartley Public School with the Sarat Bose Road address changing hands this weekend and the former board being slapped with an eviction notice, sparking confusion among 1,300 students, their parents and teachers.        
	On Sunday, a banner with the new name covered the old signboard and a legal notice pasted near the gate announced a change in possession of the premises, with a reassurance that the new owners would continue to run the school so that the students / staff do not suffer.        
	But that was not enough to allay the fears among a group of parents huddled in front of the schools shut gate with the future of the 76-year-old institution in apparent doubt.        
	We are worried about the fallout of the legal tangle. The future of our children is at stake. If the school shuts down now, no school in the city will admit my son mid-term, said Gopal Krishna Banerjee, whose son is a Class VI topper.        
	His apprehensions are not unfounded as a member of the trustee board that was running the school from 1991 till Friday said that they would be filing a case against the transfer of the management of the school to a board formed by current owner Pradip Ghosh.        
	We could not appeal in the high court against the decree of eviction issued by the Alipore court because of the lawyers strike from November 3 to 13. We will challenge the decree on Monday as soon as the court opens, said Manish Fatehpuria.        
	According to a police complaint lodged by principal Maitreyee Das, innumerable men entered the school premises around 2.30pm on Friday, 20 of them barging into her room and compelling her to receive the court order brought in by the bailiff.         
	Z. Rehman, the advocate of Ghosh, owner of the 11/4 Sarat Bose Road property on which the school stands, refuted Dass charge.        
	Caught in the crossfire, parents are fearing the worst. Why have we been kept in the dark about the legal battle over possession of the premises? Also, what happens to the Rs 5.5 lakh raised from students by the earlier board to install air conditioners? said the father of a boy in Class VI.        
	On behalf of Pradip Ghosh, Z. Rehman told Metro: We want to assure all the students and members of the staff that the change of the board of trustees would not affect the daily running of the school. Regular classes would go on; students would write the Madhyamik and Higher Secondary exams as planned.        
	Hartleys was established as a kindergarten school by a British family, who had rented the land from the Ghoshs, the zamindars of Pathuriaghata. It later became a primary school and then a high school. In 1977, local trustees were appointed. In 1991, the Fathehpurias became the trustees. The Ghoshs had first filed an eviction suit in 1973.

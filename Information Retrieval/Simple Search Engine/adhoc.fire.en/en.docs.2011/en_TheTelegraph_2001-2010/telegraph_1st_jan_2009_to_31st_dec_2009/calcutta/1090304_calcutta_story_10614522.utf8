                      A world of magic                    Conjuring fantasy from fact and manipulating truth to make it appear bizarre are the mthodes dart of magicians, who charm and captivate our senses with their clever artistry and sleight of hand. Turning the impossible into a tangible object of entertainment and art, they bring joy and laughter to their audience, both young and old. Lovers of hocus pocus in the city have reason to cheer as Federation of Indian Magic Associates (FIMA) is set to host FIMA Magic Fair 2009, the first ever national magic fair in the country.

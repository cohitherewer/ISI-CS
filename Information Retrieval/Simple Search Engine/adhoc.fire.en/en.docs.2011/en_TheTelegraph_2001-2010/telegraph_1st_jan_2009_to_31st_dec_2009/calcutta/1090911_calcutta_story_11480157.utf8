                      Contemporary colours                    Since the dawn of the 21st century, the contemporary art scene has witnessed a growth and diversity like never before. In India, art has always been an integral part of our life and culture. Excavations of art objects from historical places have shown that Indian art had reached very high degrees of sophistication at various times in our history. Many of the artists of our time use these historical styles in their work. Likewise, other artists draw their inspiration from the rich folk traditions of India or are influenced by European and Oriental styles of art. Though contemporary artists draw inspiration from various sources and styles, Indian art still retains its distinct indegenous quality. Newer styles, hitherto unseen, are also emerging, as are forms and styles that cannot be categorised into any specific existing genre. The ongoing group exhibition of contemporary art features works that bring together the amazing variety and vitality of the current generation of artists. Eye-catching and emotionally stirring, they consist of panels that resonate the seasons of nature and tides of emotions. Quirky fusions of brilliant hues and energising flow of light in space mingle with abstract contextual themes and gentle, tinted landscapes, all bearing handsome testimony to the skill and finesse of the artists. Participants include Aditya Basak, Sukanta Das, Subrata Gangopadhyay, Suhas Roy, Samir Paul (a painting by him appears here), Bratin Khan and Sibsaday Chaudhuri.                    lEvent: A group exhibition of paintings lWhen: Till September 19 (Sunday by appointment); 10.30 am - 6.30 pm lWhere: Idiyas Gallery, 15 Dover Road

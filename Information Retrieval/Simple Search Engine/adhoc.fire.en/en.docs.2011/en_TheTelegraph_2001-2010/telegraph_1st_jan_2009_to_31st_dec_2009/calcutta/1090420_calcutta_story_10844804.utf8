The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fence plan for airport jackals 
                                                                                                               Fence plan for airport jackals 
  - rules bar construction around runway          SANJAY MANDAL                                                      
	The forest department has proposed that the two runways in the airport be fenced to keep jackals at bay, putting the authorities in a fix since rules prohibit construction in the area.        
	The rules say there should not be any obstruction within 280 metres on either side of a runway. This is the first time any airport has received a proposal to fence the runways to stop jackals, said a senior Calcutta airport official.        
	We will forward the proposal to the Delhi headquarters and wait for its decision, he added.        
	The Airports Authority of India (AAI) had last year requested the state forest department to conduct a survey for relocating jackals that live in the airfield. The forest officials recently suggested that 10ft high metal wire fences be erected on both sides of the primary and secondary runways (see graphic).         
	The primary runway is 3,627 metres while the secondary runway is 2,819 metres. The secondary runway is being extended by 410 metres on the southern side.        
	According to International Civil Aviation Organisation rules, there should be no obstruction within 280 metres of the runways for the safety of aircraft.        
	The wings of an aircraft can hit the fence. Safety issues need to be discussed before implementing the proposal, said an airport official.        
	The forest department has also proposed that the AAI set up a team to observe the movement and behaviour of jackals round the clock for three months. This is also a problem since our men are not experts at this, said the official. Implementing the proposals would cost the AAI around Rs 3 crore.        
	Officials said 15-20 jackals loiter in the airports operation area. As a result, several takeoffs and landings have been delayed in the past few months. An Airbus A320 burns air turbine fuel worth around Rs 1.2 lakh if it has to hover over the airport for 30 minutes. The problem intensified last monsoon when jackals, with their dens flooded, frequently came out in the open.

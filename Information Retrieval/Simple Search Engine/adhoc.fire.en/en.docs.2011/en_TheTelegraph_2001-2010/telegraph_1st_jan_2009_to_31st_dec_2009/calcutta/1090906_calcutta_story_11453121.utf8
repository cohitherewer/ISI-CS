The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sadness behind colour
                                                                                                               Sadness behind colour
                              Beena Pradhan (Anindya Shankar Ray)                            
	Rangeen is the latest cache of acrylics from Beena Pradhan at the Birla Academy of Art and Culture. A self-taught painter, Beena dreams of the day when line and colour would flow effortlessly, perfect at one go.         
	An illness at age 19 that confined her to bed for three years helped her recognise her passion for art. But Beena went on to study commerce and came to Calcutta only in 1990 for a job. Something about the city made me take up painting after marriage. Acrylic was a natural choice because watercolour wouldnt give me these shades.         
	Rangeen begins with paintings where full-bodied male and female forms are in close proximity yet always apart. The eyes for Beena are the focal points of the painting. Once I get their expression right, the rest will follow.         
	But interestingly it is always only one pair of eyes that seem alive, deep liquid pools of colour that seem to communicate things the others in the frame are unaware of. The canvasses glow with cadmium red, viridian and hookers green, cobalt blue and chrome yellow set off by brown and black.        
	Beena says she doesnt like drawing sad paintings. But sadness and alienation lurk in her canvases, even in the bright Quaternion woman, only a fraction of whose face and an ear are seen four times in different bright shades.                    SEBANTI SARKAR

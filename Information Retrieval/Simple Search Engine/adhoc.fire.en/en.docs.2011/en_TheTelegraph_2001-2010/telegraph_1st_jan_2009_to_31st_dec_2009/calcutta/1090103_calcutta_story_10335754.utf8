The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Guild wants more sops
                                                                                                               Guild wants more sops
          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	A Rs 82-lakh discount on the rent for the Milon Mela fair ground wasnt enough. The Publishers and Booksellers Guild now wants more support from the government to organise the 33rd Calcutta Book Fair.         
	The guild is also eyeing corporate sponsorships for the annual event.        
	These are troubled times for the markets and we, too, are affected. Obviously, we would expect help from all quarters. We would appeal to the state government to lend us more support so that the fair can match international standards, said Tridib Chatterjee, the general secretary of the guild.        
	We would reach out to the corporate world as well, he added.        
	Chatterjees appeal, coming barely weeks after the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government slashed the rent for the Milon Mela ground from Rs 1.2 crore to Rs 38 lakh, has left many wondering how much support would keep the guild satisfied.        
	When the Book Fair was held on the Maidan, guild insiders admit, the organisers enjoyed discounts and waivers in various forms, including the money they owed to the police, fire services department and the civic body.        
	This year, when the guild was asked to pay the crore-plus rent, the organisers shot off a letter to the government asking for a concession, saying the amount was way above our means.        
	We have to shell out Rs 61 lakh just for basic preparations before holding the fair. Apart from the rent, we would be spending Rs 20 lakh on readying the ground. Add to that Rs 3 lakh to be spent on setting up stalls and other infrastructure, explained Chatterjee.        
	We have not raised the fee for participants even though the number of stalls would be lesser this year as the current venue is much smaller, he pointed out.        
	The fair organisers are in talks with a private company for bus pick-ups from at least six points in the city. Five acres adjacent to the fair site would be used to park buses. There would be a provision for car parking too, the organisers said.        
	Beginning January 28, the Book Fair will continue till February 8. Its signature tune will be Oi dakchhe boi.         
	The fair will also give away for the first time a Lifetime Achievement Award of Rs 2 lakh to an author and awards for Promising Litterateur and Promising Publisher.

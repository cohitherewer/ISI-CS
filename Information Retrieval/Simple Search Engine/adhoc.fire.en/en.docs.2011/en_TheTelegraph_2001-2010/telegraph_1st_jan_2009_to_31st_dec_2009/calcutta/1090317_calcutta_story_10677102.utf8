                      Mighty rhythm of nature                    Love for nature is a favourite, recurrent theme among artists, who have portrayed for us endless images of its lush, idyllic and bounteous beauty. Young artist Madhumati is essentially a nature painter, but with a difference. Trained in the visual arts at Kala Bhavana, Santiniketan and with an awareness of the romantic symphonies in Western music, she combines and converges her diverse skills and knowledge to produce works of art that reflect the archetypal flux, cadence and balance in nature. What is most interesting about her works is the way in which they simultaneously convey the constancy and change in the natural world, a truth which contains in itself one of the universes most enduring mysteries. In her works, the earth and its flora and fauna are found to be violently tossed by tumultuous storms, sometimes appearing dim and blurred through the darkness of the night or the haze of clouds and dust that obliterate the sun. Luminescence, the ongoing solo show of her recent oils on canvas, celebrates the rhythms of nature in motion. Displaying no trace of fear at the fury of the elements, she also makes her viewers enjoy the swirling gyration of wind-tossed and weather-lashed land and vegetation. Painting powerful strokes with bold swipes of her brush, she brings forth colours and tones that both express the awe-inspiring ferocity of nature as well as the natural, diurnal alternating of light and darkness.                  Event: An exhibition of paintings by Madhumati When: Till March 19; 4 pm - 8 pm Where: Gallery Paramhansa on the Vivada Cruise, Millennium Park

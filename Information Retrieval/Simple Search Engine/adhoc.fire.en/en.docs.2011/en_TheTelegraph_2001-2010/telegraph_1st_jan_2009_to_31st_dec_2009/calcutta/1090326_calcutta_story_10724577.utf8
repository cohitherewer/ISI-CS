	A resident of Baranagar has alleged that her locker at a nationalised bank in Howrah has been cleaned out.        
	Anima Dutta, in her mid-50s, lodged a complaint with Domjur police station stating that when she opened her locker at the banks Makardah branch on Tuesday, she found it empty.        
	She accused the branch manager and other bank employees of stealing gold ornaments weighing 32 bhori, worth around Rs 5 lakh, from the locker.        
	Jewellery received during my two sons weddings, as well as my own ornaments, were kept in the locker, said Anima, who lives in Dubai for six months in a year as both her sons work there in the jewellery industry.         
	She last opened her locker on July 4, 2008.        
	Anima said the branch manager, Vijay Agarwal, had told her on Wednesday that she had possibly not closed the locker the last time she opened it. But how is that possible? On Tuesday, I found the locker locked, Anima told Metro.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Job scam accused arrested in Delhi
                                                                                                               Job scam accused arrested in Delhi
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The city police on Thursday arrested a key member of the racket behind the railway recruitment scam in New Delhi.        
	Police said Amit Chaudhuri, alias Anupam, who was produced in a Calcutta court on Friday and remanded in police custody, used to collect money from candidates in return for fake railway job letters.        
	We have seized several hard disks and a few cellphones from his home. Amit would collect between Rs 1.5 lakh and Rs 3 lakh from job aspirants. He would keep part of the money and pass on the rest to the other gang members, said joint commissioner (headquarters) Jawed Shamim.        
	The 28-year-old, a resident of Muzzafarpur in Bihar, was the third person to be arrested in connection with the scam. The other two held were Subh Prakash Singh and Uma Shankar Singh. Sleuths said Subh Prakash was involved in the creation of a fake railway website.        
	We have learnt that Amit had recently duped a youth from Patna by promising him a linesmans job in the railway. The youth paid him Rs 1.75 lakh, said assistant commissioner Swapan Dasgupta.        
	Officers said the racket would hand over fake appointment letters and identity cards. The candidates were also provided with employee numbers and made to put their thumb impressions on an attendance register.        
	The city police started probing the case after the city-based Railway Recruitment Board lodged a complaint with the detective department early this year.

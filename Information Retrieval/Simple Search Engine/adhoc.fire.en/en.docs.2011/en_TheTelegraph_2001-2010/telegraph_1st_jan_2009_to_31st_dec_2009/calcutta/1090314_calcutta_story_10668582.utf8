	The soul is pure, full of love, peace, light and bliss, the anchor told a packed house at Kala Mandir. Thus began Maryward: An Inspiration For All Ages  a play performed by the students of Loreto Convent, Entally.         
	Staged in February, it was the culmination of celebrations marking the 400th birth anniversary of Maryward, the founder of the Loreto institutions.         
	The play revolved around Marywards life and her pioneering effort towards education of the girl child. From the time she uttered her first word, Jesus, to her childhood acts of charity and dedication to God, every aspect of her life was depicted.         
	Aditi Naskar, a Class IX student, played a convincing devil trying to persuade Maryward not to take the Holy Communion. Her dance with 24 helpers was a perfect foil to the peace surrounding Maryward.         
	The stage props portraying a domestic scene, complete with carpet, chairs, a grandfather clock and fireplace, were very realistic.

	The welcome dance was a display of colourful costumes and quick movements, as students with crowns on their heads matched steps with the background score.         
	The excitement was palpable backstage as students got ready for their performance. Afreen and Shahina Parveen of Class V could not wait to start their Baptism dance.         
	Weve been here since 8.30 in the morning, gearing up for the big moment, they gushed, looking pretty in their green and white costumes.         
	Sayenka Das of Class X played Maryward with lan. Thanks to the play, we know a lot more about our founder. Her dedication is inspiring, she said.         
	Her younger counterpart in the play, played by Oindrilla Gupta of Class VIII, was equally excited. I love everything about my role, she said, making a pretty picture in a blue dress and a pearl string around her neck.        
	As guests teemed out of the auditorium at the end of the show, most had smiles on their faces. I wish such events were organised when we were in school, rued Priyam Motayed, an ex-student.

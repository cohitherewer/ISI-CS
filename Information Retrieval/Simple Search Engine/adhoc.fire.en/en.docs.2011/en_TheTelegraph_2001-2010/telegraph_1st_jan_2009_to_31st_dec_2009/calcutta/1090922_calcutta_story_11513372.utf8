The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Supply ready for Puja lights
                                                                                                               Supply ready for Puja lights
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Power generation and distribution units have claimed they are ready to meet the extra demand on the six festive days, starting Panchami (Wednesday).        
	An official of CESC, which serves most of the city and Howrah, said the utility could supply around 1,500MW during Puja. Sources in the West Bengal Power Development Corporation Limited (WBPDCL), which generates nearly 70 per cent of the electricity in Bengal, said they were ready to supply 3,300MW in the festive week along with other agencies.        
	The planning began months ago and the agencies concerned have worked to rule out possible snags as much as possible, a power department official said.        
	We met Puja organisers to get an idea about the power demand. Adequate back-up measures are in place. There is no need to worry, a CESC official told Metro.        
	Demand for electricity is expected to peak on Panchami and Sashthi as the demands for pandal illumination, industry and office as well as households will coincide. From Saptami to Dashami, factories and offices will remain closed and the demand is likely to come down by 70-100MW in CESC areas and 200-350MW in the rest of the state, said a power department official.        
	CESC is expected to generate 975MW with the Budge Budge plant contributing the most  500MW.        
	We have stocked over 1 lakh metric tonnes of coal which will ensure generation for two days even if supply is disrupted, said a WBPDCL official.        
	The peak hour demand on the six Puja days is usually 2,400MW and we are ready to supply more than 2,600MW, said Debashis Sen, the WBPDCL managing director.

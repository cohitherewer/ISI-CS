The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Central alert on Taliban attack
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Central alert on Taliban attack
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A missive from the Centre has warned the state government of possible strikes by the Taliban and Lashkar-e-Toiba on Calcutta.        
	The alert, issued by the Union home ministry, says Taliban and Lashkar militants have entered the country through Kupwara district in Kashmir and fanned out across the country in an attempt to trigger blasts in select cities, including Calcutta, Delhi and Mumbai.        
	The message has been passed on to the director-general of police, Bhupinder Singh, and police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti, home secretary Ardhendu Sen said.        
	The alert did not rule out the possibility of the militants being accompanied by fidayeen or suicidal squad members. Crowded zones are the most likely targets, said Sen.         
	Senior officers at Lalbazar said the Special Task Force (STF) had been asked to activate its source network.         
	We are activating our sources in some pockets that are known to be the refuge of terrorists. Our counterparts in North and South 24-Parganas, too, have been alerted because a number of youths working as agents of various terror networks have been arrested in these two districts, said an STF officer.         
	The Special Operations Group of the CID has been asked to step up vigil along the Indo-Bangla border.

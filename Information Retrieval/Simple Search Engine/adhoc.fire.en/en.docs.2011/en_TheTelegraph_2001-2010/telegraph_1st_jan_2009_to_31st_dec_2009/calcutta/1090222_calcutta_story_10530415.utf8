	The Tricontinental Film Festival returned to Calcutta for its fifth year, bringing with it a basket of 13 documentaries from Latin America, Asia and Africa that were screened between February 6 and 8 at Nandan II. The films document the struggles, triumphs and evolution of individuals and communities in the context of human rights.        
	A yearly event in collaboration with Uhru Productions, the festival that began in 2002, has managed to carve a niche for itself in India. The films did the rounds of Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Goa before halting in Calcutta. Initiated by Breakthrough, a human rights organisation, the festival was held in association with the NGO Swayam and film association Cine Central  and watched by a small but enthusiastic audience.        
	The films were picked by a special jury comprising Aruna Vasudev, Anurag Kashyap and Madhushree Dutta from India, Amir Muhammad of Malaysia and Nick Deocampo from The Philippines.         
	The Sari Soldiers is about Nepalese women who form a substantial part of the Maoist party in Nepal. The story begins four years after the royal family massacre, followed by Gyanendras rise to the throne and the beginning of the Maoist insurgency in Nepal. The story traces a day in the life of Devi, who travels back to her village after she had protested the killing of her 18-year-old niece, who was raped, tortured and left to die by the Royal Nepal Army. Behind Forgotten Eyes was about the fight for survival of Korean women taken up as sex slaves by the Jap-anese army during the Second World War.         
	Nicolas Bruckman from the US was at the festival on Day II when his documentary The American was screened. The film dwells on the life of Carmen, an illegal immigrant in the US who is in New York City to support her daughter Carla. Bruckman, who showed interest in the border issues between India and Bangladesh, felt that Obamas regime might bring about a positive change in such areas.         
	Undercover in Tibet is a personal account of refugee Tash Despa who returns to the land he fled 11 years ago to secretly film the heavily controlled lives of Tibetans by Chinese authorities.       MOHUA DAS

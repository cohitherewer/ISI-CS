The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Spot marking of scripts
                                                                                                               Spot marking of scripts
  - ISC/ICSE council to change system from 2010 session          MITA MUKHERJEE                                                  
	Examiners cannot bring ISCE/ISC answer scripts home from the next academic session.        
	The Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations, which conducts the ICSE (Class X) and ISC (Class XII) exams, has issued a circular stating that examiners and team leaders will have to assess the scripts sitting in designated centres.        
	We are changing the system in an attempt to make the evaluation process more transparent and expedite the publication of results, said an official of the Delhi-based council.        
	Gerry Arathoon, the officiating chief executive of the council, was unavailable for comment.        
	Under the previous system, examiners used to gather at distribution centres from where they were supposed to head straight home after being allotted answer scripts.        
	After evaluation, the examiners had to return the scripts to the centres from where they were distributed. In the next stage, the leaders of the various teams of examiners would take the scripts home for re-evaluation.         
	It was only after the re-checking was done that the council took back the scripts.        
	Since the process involved taking scripts home twice, chances of delay or foul play could not be ruled put, the council official pointed out, explaining the reason for the switch.        
	In the new system, checking and re-checking both have to be done in the designated centres to be set up in ICSE/ISC schools.        
	The circular has asked the principals of all affiliated schools to grant 15 days leave to at least one senior teacher from each subject in March for the evaluation.         
	The council has also asked the schools to make necessary arrangements for examiners if evaluation centres are set up on their premises.        
	News of the change in system evoked mixed response among the heads of ICSE/ISC schools in the city.        
	The centralised system will ensure fairness in the evaluation process. Over the past few years we had been noticing that students were not being assessed properly, said the principal of a reputable ISC school.        
	Sujoy Biswas, the principal of Rammohan Mission School, too welcomed the move but feared disruption in academic activities if senior teachers were to be released for evaluation 15 days at a stretch.

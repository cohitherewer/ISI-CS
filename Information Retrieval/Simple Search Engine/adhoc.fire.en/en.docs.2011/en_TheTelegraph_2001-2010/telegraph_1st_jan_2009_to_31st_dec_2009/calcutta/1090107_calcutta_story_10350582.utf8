                      Tradition and trend in modern Bengal art        In the context of art and, in fact, all creative fields, convention has played a curious role in shaping its practice in any given era. Though traditional styles of creativity have usually gained acceptance in society, those that departed from convention have made a more remarkable impact on the popular psyche. Approaches to art that are original, innovative and do not depend on the influences of the past have attracted the imagination in a way that traditional art forms have not. Yet, anything that goes beyond convention is not necessarily unconventional. Cubism, once considered as an unconventional art style, has an intrinsic connection with primitive tradition and is now an accepted convention. Convention also refers to established norms. As art becomes conventional, it loses its uniqueness and sharpness and must invariably yield its place to the new. This shift of paradigm is essential to the progress of art. Featuring works by 15 painters and five sculptors, Beyond Convention: A Glimpse of Contemporary Trends in Bengal Art attempts to highlight how new paradigms have been shaped from post-colonial and modern concepts of the last century. It shows the way in which the influences of the past are simultaneously at work with a persistent search for the new. Participants: Partha Pratim Deb, Arunima Chowdhury, Chhatrapati Dutta, Kazi Nasir, Pankaj Panwar and others. Curated by Mrinal Ghosh.

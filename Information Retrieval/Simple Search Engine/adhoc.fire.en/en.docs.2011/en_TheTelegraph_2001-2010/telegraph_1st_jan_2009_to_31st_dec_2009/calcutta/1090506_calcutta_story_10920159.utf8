The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sachin who hit bully for a six   He fought EC for wifes sake
                                                                                                               Sachin who hit bully for a six             DEBASHIS CHATTOPADHYAY                        The mint-green Tata Safari remained in the possession of the sub-divisional officer on Tuesday. (Bishwarup Dutta)            Sachin Halder: ldquo;The car is for my wife...the slightest exposure to the sun rsquo;s rays causes red blotches on her skin rdquo;                                
	Sachin Halder may own a Tata Safari but he prefers his trusty 100cc Yamaha motorcycle.        
	I can do with my bike; the car is for my wife. Gayatri requires an air-conditioned vehicle the moment she steps out of home because the slightest exposure to the suns rays causes red blotches on her skin, the trader from Canning, who also owns two mini-trucks and a bus, told Metro.        
	It was for Gayatri, who travels 54km once every week to see a dermatologist, that Halder had dragged the Election Commission to court last month demanding that his requisitioned car be returned.        
	The high court ruled in his favour on Monday, turning the 51-year-old into a David who took on bully-boy Goliath and won.        
	Halder was supposed to get back his car immediately but sub-divisional officer (SDO) Md Shahid held on to it on Tuesday, arguing that he would comply with the order only after receiving a copy of it.        
	Election officials did the rounds of South 24-Parganas in the comfort of the mint-green Safari, fitted with twin air-conditioners and a TV, throughout the day.        
	The SDOs office had taken custody of the SUV on April 23, rejecting Halders request for exemption on the ground that his wife would need the vehicle to visit her doctor at least once every week.        
	Halder was having lunch that afternoon when a peon sent by the SDO knocked on his door to deliver the requisition notice from his boss. This may be treated as top most (sic) urgent, the note said.        
	As he read the rest of the note, Halder panicked.         
	I was asked to deposit my new car (WB 20U-0141) with the SDOs office latest by 2.30pm or face legal action. I looked at my watch and it was already 2.15pm. I didnt even have the time to think, he recalled.        
	The SDOs messenger allegedly threatened to call other staff members of the office to break open the garage door and take away the Safari if he did not act fast.                                            
	Halder first called his driver Munna Sheikh, who was then at a wedding, before setting off for the SDOs office on his motorcycle. Munna reached the office with the car soon after.        
	So, what prompted Halder to move court after complying with the SDOs order?        
	I wouldnt have taken this lying down under any circumstances. I deposited my car with the SDOs office to ensure that they could not take action against me before I did what I intended to, he explained.        
	Sibaprasad Sinha, a lawyer friend from Alipore, advised Halder to petition the high court instead of seeking redress in a local court.         
	A clause in the Motor Vehicles Act, which says that the owner of a private vehicle has to seek the motor vehicles departments permission before allowing anyone else to use it, apparently strengthened Halders case.        
	His lawyer, Dipankar Basu, also cited a 2006 ruling by Justice Girish Chandra Gupta in a similar case to counter the government counsels argument that the SDO was within his rights to requisition any vehicle he deemed fit for poll purposes.         
	The court ruled that requisitioning a private vehicle meant for personal use was contrary to the Representation of the People Act, 1951, which the Election Commission uses as a licence to requisition any vehicle or barge into spaces like the National Library.        
	Halder admitted to feeling uncomfortable with the attention he was getting since the courts verdict but said more public activism was required to prevent misuse of laws like Section 160 of the Representation of the People Act.        
	Wife Gayatri said she felt relieved after the court verdict. I am due for a visit to my doctor in a couple of days. My skin disease makes it impossible for me to travel anywhere if I dont have a car.        
	The Halders have two sons, one of them studying to be a lawyer and the other a civil services aspirant.

                      Poetic expression of nature                          The infinite beauty and immeasurable power of nature have always been a source of inspiration to artists involved in any form of creativity. An ardent nature lover, Anita Roy Chowdhury is interested more in discovering the pulsating poetry in nature rather than exploring its external reality. The diversity of natures ever-changing beauty, as light and shade play hide and seek with it, finds expression in her paintings. Free lines, indicating forms and shapes, play a pivotal role in the structure of her paintings. Characterised by undulating curves, zigzag turns and spirals that help create visual metaphors, her recent works, on display at the ongoing show, bear the distinctive mark of her own aesthetic values. A result of his personal expedition through nature, the semi-abstract forms of Subhendu Sarkar reflect his perception of it on a subconscious level.                                Event: An exhibition of recent works by Anita Roy Chowdhury and Subhendu Sarkar

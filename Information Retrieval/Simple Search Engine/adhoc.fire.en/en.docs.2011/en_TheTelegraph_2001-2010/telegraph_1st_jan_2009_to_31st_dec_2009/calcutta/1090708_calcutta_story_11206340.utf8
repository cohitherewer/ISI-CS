                      Celebration of Indian heritage                    Endowed with a deep and intuitive understanding of the special advantages of watercolour as a medium of visual expression, Sudipta Karmakar can effortlessly capture the essence and inherent vibrancy of any moment or scene. Wonders of India, the ongoing exhibition of his works, depicts architectural masterpieces including the Taj Mahal, the Golden Temple, the Red Fort, the Meenakshi Temple and the Khajuraho engravings. Combining an accuracy of observation with incredible technical precision, he conveys their mystery, charm and romance through sensitive forms and tones. Avoiding all temptation towards grandeur and obvious drama, he concentrates on developing the intimacy and atmosphere of the incidental. In his portrayals, Karmakar uses a large and varied visual vocabulary: part traditional, part modern, part re-invented and part unabashedly harkening back to earlier forms. Ultimately, what the artist achieves is a style that, while taking reference from and maintaining tradition, also bears witness to his personal experience and appropriation of Indian religion, culture and tradition.                  Event: An exhibition of watercolours by Sudipta Karmakar When: Till July 15 (except Sunday); 11 am - 7 pm Where: Gallery K2, Supra Court, 35 Lansdowne Terrace

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Water woes from denim dye units
                                                                                                               Water woes from denim dye units
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Around 400 residents demonstrated outside Mahestala municipality on Tuesday morning demanding immediate removal of denim dyeing and bleaching units from the area.         
	According to the protesters, the 1,500-plus denim dyeing units in the area  many of them unregistered  discharge untreated water into Moni Canal causing health hazards.         
	Denim processed at the factories is sold in Bihar, Orissa, Jharkhand and other neighbouring states.        
	Hriday Haran Naskar, a resident, accused the units of violating environment norms and causing diarrhoea in the area.        
	We have complained to the municipal authorities several times but to no avail. Many children are suffering as a result, he added.        
	Kali Bhandari, the chairman of the municipality, admitted that some of the units were draining polluted water into the canal.        
	We cannot relocate all the units at one go. We have informed the chief ministers office about the matter, he said.         
	According to Bhandari, it was decided at a recent meeting in Writers Buildings that two clusters would be built to relocate the units.         
	One of them will come up on a 10-acre plot near Akra Phatak and the other on a 90-acre land at Mahisgot. The first cluster will be built by the state government, while the second one will be jointly funded by the government and the unit owners. We have got the plots and work will start soon, said Bhandari.

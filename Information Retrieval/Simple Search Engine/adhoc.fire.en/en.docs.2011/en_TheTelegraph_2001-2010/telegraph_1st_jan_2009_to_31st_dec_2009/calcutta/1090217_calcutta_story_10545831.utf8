	Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi, who is also the chancellor of the Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu), stayed away from its convocation on Monday.         
	The governor was not able to attend the convocation because he was preoccupied, said registrar Biman Bandopadhyay. According to Besu insiders, however, the governor deliberately stayed away to make known his displeasure at the way things are being run at the university.        
	A Raj Bhavan spokesperson said on Monday night that the governor had informed the Besu authorities that he would not attend the convocation since he was scheduled to travel to Delhi during the day.        
	Though his Delhi trip was cancelled, he stayed away from the convocation knowing that the authorities had made alternative arrangements. He did not want to disturb the arrangements, added the spokesperson, pointing out that Gandhi had signed the 700-plus university certificates.        
	The governor seems to be attending all other programmes, including those at other universities. His absence at the Besu convocation has obvious implications, said a spokesperson of the universitys teachers union.         
	Besu recently elected its court and other statutory bodies. The convocation was the first meeting of the newly elected court and the chancellor has absented himself on the occasion. This does not bode too well for the university, said a senior professor.

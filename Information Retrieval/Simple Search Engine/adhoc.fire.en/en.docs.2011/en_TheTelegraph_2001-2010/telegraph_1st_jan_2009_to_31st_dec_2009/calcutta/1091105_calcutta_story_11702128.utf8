The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Status quo on hawkers
                                                                            Thursday , November 5 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Status quo on hawkers
  - Three days before court date, pavement custodians inert          OUR BUREAU                           Hawkers overrun a footpath on Brabourne Road.   (Bishwarup Dutta)                                              
	Administrative inaction that has allowed transporters to spew poison into the air we breathe is at work again to let hawkers rule the pavements we are meant to walk on.        
	Even a high court deadline on hawkers has failed to rouse the authorities, with the civic body and police blaming their lack of action on political compulsions.        
	The division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice B. Somadder had on October 23 set a fortnights deadline to the government to file a report on the steps it had taken to remove hawkers from the pavements of eight arteries in the central business district.        
	With just three days to go for the deadline, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya couldnt care less. A hawker eviction drive cannot be launched without an all-party consensus, he said on Wednesday. How and when that will happen is anybodys guess.        
	And what role could the police play to restore the citizens right to pavements? Nothing much, judging by deputy commissioner (traffic) Dilip Bandopadhyays comment that the force had not received any intimation from any quarter on this issue yet.        
	Several senior officers who did not wish to be named said the force had been saddled with the impossible task of keeping both the court and the hawkers happy. The hawkers are backed by a strong political lobby. Any hasty action or use of force will spell trouble. At the same time we cant be seen violating the court order, said an officer in a fix.        
	Mayor Bhattacharyya, the custodian of the citys footpaths, refused to specify the civic bodys plan of action.        
	We have conveyed our stand to the government, which will table a report in the high court when the case will be heard again, he said.        
	Subhash Dutta, who had filed a petition in the high court in 2003 seeking an order for the removal of hawkers from pavements and thoroughfares, said political patronage had made the hawkers immune to even judicial intervention. Does anyone expect anything new in the status report? The government has been saying the same things in the court for the past three years, he added.        
	The number of hawkers on the citys pavements and roads total more than 2,50,000. The eight thoroughfares under the court scanner are Brabourne Road, KK Tagore Street, Kalakar Street, NS Road, Strand Road, Rabindra Sarani, Mahatma Gandhi Road and AJC Bose Road.

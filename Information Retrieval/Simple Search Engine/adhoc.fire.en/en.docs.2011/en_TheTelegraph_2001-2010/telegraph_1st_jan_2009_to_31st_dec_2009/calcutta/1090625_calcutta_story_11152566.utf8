The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | One transfer trips results of lakhs
                                                                                                               One transfer trips results of lakhs
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	A new job for a senior official of Calcutta University will delay the publication of results of more than 3.5 lakh undergraduate students.        
	Onkarsadhan Adhikari, the controller of examinations, joined as president of the state higher secondary education council on Wednesday.        
	So, the blank marksheets he had signed in advance for the BA, BSc and BCom examinees, whose results were to be declared between June 30 and September, stand cancelled.        
	Sources in the examination department said all the marksheets would now have to be reprinted and signed by officiating controller Debashis Biswas, a process that would take at least a month.        
	Postgraduate students will not be affected as their marksheets do not carry the controllers signature.        
	Pro vice-chancellor (academic) Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee, however, asserted there would be no delay in the declaration of the undergraduate results. There is no crisis and the university is doing the needful to ensure timely publication of results.        
	Officials in the examination department laughed away Chatterjees assertion. Of course there will be a delay. The controllers departure has thrown all our plans awry. Now everything has to start from scratch, said an official.        
	The worst-affected would be the one lakh-odd students who had appeared in the Part III exams this year. Their results were to be announced on June 30. Its our top priority to prepare their results but there is little chance of the marksheets being handed over to them before July 15, the official added.        
	Many of the Part III examinees have applied for postgraduate courses in universities in other states.        
	A delayed publication of results would affect their chances as they are required to produce their marksheets to the universities by the second week of July.        
	I am supposed to submit my BSc marksheet to Banaras Hindu University, where I have applied for an MSc course, in the first week of July. If the results are delayed I may lose the opportunity of studying there, said a chemistry honours student.         
	A large number of CU students also apply for masters courses in Jawaharlal Nehru University and Delhi University. Sources in JNU said CU officials had alerted them about a possible delay in publishing the Part III results.        
	The authorities claimed the cost of reprinting the 3.5 lakh-odd marksheets would be negligible as the university had its own press. But a source in the printing business put the cost at no less than Rs 3 lakh, at the rate of 80 paise per marksheet.        
	Was there any way the situation could have been averted? For that the controller should have been asked to take over the council chiefs post before the blank marksheets carrying his signature went to print in March. But the government decided on Adhikaris new assignment a fortnight ago after the council presidents post fell vacant, said an official.

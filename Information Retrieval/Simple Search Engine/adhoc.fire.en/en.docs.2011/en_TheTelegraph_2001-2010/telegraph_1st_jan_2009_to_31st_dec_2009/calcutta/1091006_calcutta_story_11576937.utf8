The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pay peeve for principals 
                                                                                                               Pay peeve for principals

	Colleges could soon be functioning full-time without principals  not because these institutions can do without them but because nobody would want to be a principal with the salary of an associate professor.        
	The West Bengal College Service Commission has written to the University Grants Commission (UGC) about the possibility of colleges not finding replacements for outgoing heads because of a salary revision that has brought principals pay on a par with that of associate professors.         
	There will be an acute shortage of principals over the next few years if they are not paid more than teachers without administrative responsibilities.We have sent a team to Delhi to apprise the UGC of the impending crisis, the chairman of the college service commission, Himangshu Ghosh, told Metro.        
	As many as 30 colleges in Calcutta and its outskirts are already being managed by teachers-in-charge. The list includes the City Group of Colleges, Manindra Chandra College, Bangabasi (Day) College and Shyamaprasad College.        
	By 2011, the majority of colleges in the city could be without full-time principals unless the UGC introduces a higher pay band for them, said Anjan Sengupta, the general secretary of the All Bengal Principals Council.        
	According to officials of the college service commission, principals of several state-aided colleges in the city are set to retire over the next two years.         
	Nearly 110 of the 390 colleges in the state are functioning without principals at present.        
	There will be an even sharper drop in the number of applicants for principals posts in the coming years if the pay-parity rule is not amended. No teacher would like to shoulder the burden of administrative work without incentives, an official said.        
	The starting salary in the pay band that includes associate professors, professors and principals is around Rs 43,400. According to the new promotion rules, all teachers will be included in this pay band after aggregating 21 years in the profession. A teacher will also have to work for almost the same period to be eligible to apply for the post of principal, said Sengupta.        
	What has irked the principals council most is that associate professors with more experience than the heads of institutions will draw higher salaries without shouldering any responsibility other than teaching.

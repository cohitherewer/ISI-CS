The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Surgery lifeline for youth
                                                                                                               Surgery lifeline for youth
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 25-year-old man whose liver, kidney and intestine were dislocated to his right chest after a wheel of a truck went over him has recovered after surgery in a state-run hospital.        
	In October last year, Pintu Mondal, who worked in a tea stall in Behala, was riding a bicycle on Diamond Harbour Road when it was hit by a truck. A part of the rear wheel of the truck went over my abdomen and I became unconscious, recounted Mondal in the cardio-thoracic ward of Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital.        
	When he came to, he could not find any injury mark on his body. That night, however, he started feeling breathless. He was taken to Vidyasagar Hospital from where he was referred to Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital.         
	An MRI showed that his diaphragm was ruptured and his liver, kidney and intestine were pushed up to the right side of his chest. They were pressing against his heart causing a steep fall in blood pressure, said Plaban Mukherjee, the head of the cardio-thoracic department of the hospital.        
	A five-hour surgery by Mukherjee and his team saved Mondals life. The doctors found during the operation that the main vessel returning blood to the heart was also ruptured. Initially, there was no bleeding as the vessel was pressing against the liver. Once the organs were pushed down, the rupture was exposed causing profuse bleeding, said Kallol Das Bakshi, one of the surgeons.         
	The injured organs were repaired and the diaphragm was reinforced with a mesh through a 14-inch incision on the thorax and abdomen.        
	Very few of those of suffer injury of this scale survive, said doctors. Normally, blood vessel damage leads to heavy bleeding. Patients die before they reach hospital. Early diagnosis and prompt intervention saved Mondals life, said surgical gastro-enterologist Sanjay De Bakshi.

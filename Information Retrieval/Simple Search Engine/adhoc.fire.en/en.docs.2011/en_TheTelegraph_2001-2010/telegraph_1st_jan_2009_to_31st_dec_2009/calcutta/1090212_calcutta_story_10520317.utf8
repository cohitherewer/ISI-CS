The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Riz case officer dead on tracks
                                                                                                               Riz case officer dead on tracks
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Arindam Manna                                  
	A young railway police sub-inspector who had briefly investigated Rizwanur Rahmans death after the discovery of his body on a rail track was found beheaded near one on Wednesday.        
	Police said Arindam Manna, 27, most likely committed suicide by jumping in front of a speeding train near Mankundu railway station, in Hooghly district, but his family cried murder.         
	Relative Srikanta Patra filed an FIR with the Government Railway Police (GRP) unit at Seoraphuli, saying Arindam had spoken to his family about a threat to his life. He had said his life was in danger and that some people wouldnt allow him to live. We found marks of injury in his right leg, left eye and neck. It was murder.         
	Speculation about a connection between Arindams involvement in the Rizwanur investigation and his death in similar circumstances prompted home secretary Ardhendu Sen to issue a statement. Arindam was the investigating officer in the Rizwanur case for only a brief period. An investigation into his death is under way but it looks like suicide, he said.         
	The railway police unit at Seoraphuli had received information around 9am about a beheaded body lying beside one of the tracks near Mankundu.         
	The body, clad in a striped red shirt and blue trousers, was mutilated. The severed head was lying on the track. We found a cellphone and an identity card, officer-in-charge Somnath Bhattacharya said.         
	Arindam, attached to Dum Dum GRP, was on sick leave since Monday. According to family members, he left his home in Dasnagar, Howrah, around 2pm on Tuesday after telling mother Malati that he was going to the Dum Dum GRP office to meet someone.         
	Around 9.30pm, he called to say that I should destroy all the papers and documents pertaining to our house. Arindam said he might have to face a CBI inquiry on the basis of complaints by colleagues who were out to harm his career, father Ashok, 61, said.         
	His mother took the second call, at 11.15pm. Arindam wanted to know whether we had destroyed the documents. He told me he was at the police station and in trouble, Malati said.        
	The familys single-storey house stands on a two-cottah plot and was built with a bank loan in 2002. The house is in Arindams name.        
	Arindams parents became jittery after their son called for the third time, at 1.32am. That was the last call. He told me that his world had been torn asunder. I heard the sound of a train passing in the background before the call ended. We couldnt get through after that, his mother said.         
	Some relatives, including Arindams cousin Bhaskar Senapati, went to Dasnagar police station around 2am on Wednesday but the officer-in-charge asked them to contact Dum Dum GRP. They reached Dum Dum at 4.30am. The officer-in-charge at Dum Dum, Manas Chakraborty, told us that Arindam had come to the office around 3.30pm and begged for forgiveness, Senapati said. We asked why Arindam had sought forgiveness but he didnt reply.        
	The relatives returned to Howrah after being asked to lodge a diary at Dasnagar police station. When they went to Dum Dum GRP for the second time at 11.30am, news had come in of a body being found.         
	The relatives reached Seerampore Walsh Hospital at 1.30pm and identified the body. The post-mortem was over by then. A demonstration by the family forced the authorities to decide on another post-mortem at Medical College. Arindam had joined the GRP in 2000 after completing his B.Com from Goenka College of Commerce.

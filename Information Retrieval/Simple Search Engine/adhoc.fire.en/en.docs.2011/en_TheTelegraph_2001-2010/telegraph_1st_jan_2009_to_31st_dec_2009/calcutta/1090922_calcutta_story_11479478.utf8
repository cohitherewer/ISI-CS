The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Speed bumps trip cars and commuters 
                                                                                                               Speed bumps trip cars and commuters

	A series of oversized speed-breakers were constructed in front of MR Bangur Hospital in a knee-jerk reaction to a recent road mishap that critically injured two persons. The speed-breakers are only causing traffic snarls and more accidents with motorists finding them difficult to negotiate. Regular commuters on the stretch and visitors to Tollygunge Club and Royal Calcutta Golf Club have been inconvenienced the most by this unscientific attempt to prevent vehicles from speeding on Deshpran Sashmal Road. Metro runs a check              
	Roll-back risk: The bumps, in sets of two and four on either side of the main gate of MR Bangur Hospital, being higher than normal, vehicles are often rolling back and hitting those behind them.        
	Drivers slow down at the bumps as usual but unless they hit the accelerator again at the right moment, the engine stops and the vehicle rolls back. When you approach the speed-breakers, you have to be wary of the vehicle in front stopping suddenly or rolling back, said Bibhuti Roy, a resident of Tollygunge who drives a Maruti Swift.        
	According to residents, heavy vehicles often roll back, smashing the headlights of small cars and motorcycles. A couple of days ago, a bus rolled back and crushed the front part of a Maruti 800. Water started to leak from the cars radiator, said Jonaki Mondal, who commutes the stretch regularly.        
	Recently the axle of a Tata 407 truck broke while negotiating the bumps.        
	Height hurdle: Tea stall owner Sheikh Asgar said people regularly fell off motorcycles, cycles and cycle-rickshaws because of the high speed breakers, especially during showers. Traffic snarls have also become common during rush hours because vehicles are forced to slow down on the stretch.        
	A few days ago, a couple fell off a cycle while negotiating the bumps and the woman broke her arm, said Kalipada Das, a cycle-rickshaw puller.        
	Students often bump their head against windows or fall off seats while school buses cross the bumps, said the conductor of a bus ferrying students of DPS, Ruby Park.        
	Snarls and confusion are also created by vehicles veering right towards the tram tracks to avoid the road bumps.        
	Commuter complaints: The speed-breakers have failed to achieve their objective. They have only become traffic hazards. Many of us are facing problems because of them, said a Tollygunge Club regular.        
	A resident of the area wondered why six speed-breakers were erected on the flank the road nearer to the hospital but not even one on the other flank.         
	Ambulance driver Bhabesh Mahato said patients often started bleeding from wounds as his vehicle bounced over the bumps.        
	Official version: We have not received an official complaint from commuters. If we do so, we will inspect the spot and get the agency concerned to make the required changes, said a senior police officer of South 24-Parganas.        
	A civic official said speed-breakers were often constructed in haste by local authorities but the municipality would take action on receipt of complaints from individuals or agencies, including the police.        
	Expert voice: The Indian Roads Congress has guidelines in regard to speed-breakers but these are seldom adhered to. A series of very small humps, called a rumble strip, can serve the dual objective of reducing vehicular speed and enhancing road safety, said Bhargab Maitra, an IIT Kharagpur teacher who has published papers on traffic management.

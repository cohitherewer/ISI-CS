	Five GeNext Calcuttans got together on Monday afternoon for a freewheeling chat on what Poll 2009 means to them. Heres what Debjyoti Mitra Roy, physiology (2nd year), Presidency College; Ahana Dey, political science (1st year), Loreto College; Rukmini Banerjee, English (2nd year), Jadavpur University; Manbir Singh Batra, BCom (3rd year), Bhawanipur Education Society College; Harsha Khorana, mass communication (3rd year), St Xaviers College, had to say:              
	Will you vote on Wednesday?        
	Debjyoti: Yes, I will definitely exercise my right. I have been posting hundreds of scraps on Orkut to urge people to vote.        
	Ahana: My name isnt on the electoral rolls.        
	Rukmini: Same here. Plus, I dont have faith in the parties. I would have tried harder to vote had I known that I can cast a blank vote.        
	Manbir: I will vote.         
	Harsha: I will. Those who dont, should lose the right to complain about the state of affairs for the next five years. A lot of older people tell me not to vote because they say their votes have not made any difference.        
	Everyone agreed online voting would increase the numbers in urban areas; Manbir wanted SMS voting.              
	Do you discuss politics/elections with family/friends?        
	Debjyoti: I am actively involved in college politics and discuss elections every day with family and friends.        
	Manbir: If something is in the news, like Varun Gandhis hate speech, I discuss it with family and friends.                                      
	Harsha: The other day I fought with my grandfather about why the CPM made inroads into Bengal. I used membership data of the party available on Wikipedia to make my point.               
	How aware are you of your constituency?        
	Debjyoti: I am from the Barasat constituency and I know it quite well.        
	Ahana: I am from Calcutta South and know the two main contestants.         
	Rukmini: Same for me.        
	Manbir: Day before yesterday, we got our voters slips from party workers. Before that I was not aware of the contestants in my constituency.         
	Harsha: I am aware of the candidates standing from South Calcutta, which is where I stay.               
	What do you think of the candidates? Are they too old/uncool/corrupt?        
	Debjyoti: More young people should come into politics to improve the situation. Politics is an ATM (any-time money) for the current crop of leaders.         
	Rukmini: They are vague, pompous and infuriating.        
	Manbir: Whether they look cool or not does not matter as long as their ideas are cool. The new generation would be less hungry for money. [The two girls and Harsha did not agree with this at all.]              
	One thing to change about the election process?        
	Debjyoti: More security so that there is no rigging.        
	Manbir: The day of the vote should not be a holiday [Debjyoti added that he had admonished his uncle for checking if the election holiday could be clubbed with a weekend].              
	Should politics find a place on the college campus?        
	Debjyoti: Yes. We call it election in our college (Presidency), selection in other colleges. We must get involved in college politics to understand the hows and whys of government politics. It is politics that determines whether teachers are transferred or not.         
	Ahana: Our college (Loretro) is not politically inclined and I dont think politics is important at this level.        
	Rukmini: I dont know how politics on campus can lead to development of students.         
	Manbir: Awareness about politics is important but forming unions isnt.        
	Harsha: Our college (Xaviers) is politically unaware. If I asked 10 people in my class about politics, not one would know much.        
	The discussion on this topic, had we not stopped it, would have continued for hours!              
	If Sourav Ganguly was a candidate would you have voted for him?        
	No! But someone like N.R. Narayana Murthy would win their vote, the five agreed.

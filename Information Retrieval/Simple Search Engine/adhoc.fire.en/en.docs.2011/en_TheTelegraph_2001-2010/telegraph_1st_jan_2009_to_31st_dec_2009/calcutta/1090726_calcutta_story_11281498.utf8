The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Future goes up in smoke
                                                                                                               Future goes up in smoke
                              Commuters made a beeline for the tram on Friday. (Amit Datta)                            
	Thanks to the Friday strike of buses and taxis in protest against the high court order banning commercial vehicles more than 15 years old, the people of Calcutta could feel  in their lungs  how these fume-belchers pollute the air.         
	For a day at least, the eco-friendly (of which some are under-rated) transport modes like trams, circular rail, Metro railway and waterways held sway over diesel-driven transportation.         
	But this is more indicative of what could be than what will be, as Calcutta will have no respite from diesel and petrol-driven commercial vehicles, at least till 2025  and is official.         
	According to the study Master Plan for Traffic amp; Transportation prepared by the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), more than 72 per cent of the daily commuters will be travelling in diesel vehicles in 2025 unless the state government pushes largescale conversion to cleaner fuel like LPG and CNG.         
	The report states that around 74 per cent of the commuters used diesel vehicles daily in 2001 and the figure will not change much even after 25 years of planning.         
	While eco-friendly modes like tram, Metro, circular rail and ferry services are projected to carry 34 lakh daily commuters in 2025, polluting autorickshaws alone will carry 31 lakh people daily. Even as greater emphasis is being laid on bigger mass transit modes to combat pollution and climate change.         
	The impact of commercial vehicles on Calcuttas climate is enormous. According to an Asian Development Bank study few years back, on-road vehicles belched out 15,810 metric tonnes RPM (respirable particulate matter), 93,859 metric tonnes nitrogen oxides, 137,454 metric tonnes carbon oxides and 51,882 metric tonnes hydrocarbon in 2003 with buses, autorickshaws and goods vehicles topping the charts. Carbon oxides and hydrocarbon are particularly damaging to climate. In 2025, the emissions can double or be even greater.         
	The government has done nothing to phase out polluting vehicles even after the high court order, but is either phasing out or giving little importance to eco-friendly modes of transport like trams, railways or waterways. If the trend continues Calcuttas climate will be much more damaged in the coming years, said Debasish Bhattacharya, a scientist with the Indian Institute of Chemical Biology.

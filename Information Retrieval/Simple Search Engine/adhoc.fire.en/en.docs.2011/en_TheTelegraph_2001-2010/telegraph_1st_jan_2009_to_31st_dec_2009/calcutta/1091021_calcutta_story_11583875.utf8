The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Parents fight on for slain son
                                                                                                               Parents fight on for slain son
          RITH BASU                               
	An elderly couple seeking justice for their slain son have spent the past year battling police inertia and an allegedly loophole-loaded chargesheet that has enabled the accused to roam free.        
	The father (the parents did not wish to be named) could only scream for mercy as his son Kaushik, 27, was being brutally assaulted by members of a local club over an allegedly stolen cellphone two days after Dashami last year. But 10 months after the young mans death from injuries allegedly suffered in that assault, his father isnt willing to give up without a fight.        
	We lost everything the day my son died. I even gave up my job because I couldnt focus on my work. The only thing that keeps us going now is our determination to see those who killed our son being punished, Kaushiks father told Metro.        
	An Alipore court recently found irregularities in the chargesheet filed by Jadavpur police station in the case and ordered a fresh probe. A new chargesheet was to be submitted in court by September 14 but the police have yet to do so.        
	The father said the inspector-in-charge of Jadavpur police station had summoned him last month with a certified copy of the court order, insisting that he was unaware of any such directive. The police have been trying to prove us wrong from the beginning, he added.        
	Sub-inspector Malay Paul, the investigating officer, allegedly never bothered contacting the parents to find out the circumstances that led to Kaushiks death. He falsely quoted us and some of our neighbours while drawing up a soft chargesheet. He even included a statement purportedly made by my son, though I know for a fact that they had never met. I challenge him to describe my sons appearance, the father said.        
	The inspector-in-charge, Prabir Roy, told Metro on Tuesday that he would have to look up the files to find out why a fresh chargesheet hadnt been filed so far.         
	Kaushiks grieving parents shifted from Naktala to Bansdroni earlier this year to escape the horrible memories but the events of October 14, 2008, will haunt them forever.        
	The father insists that his son, an automobile technician employed as a sales executive with a reputable company, was framed and then killed.        
	Some youths of Naktala had accused Kaushik of stealing a cellphone belonging to one of them and trying to sell it to his former schoolmate Ronit.        
	According to Kaushiks mother, the then unemployed Ronit was at the root of the rumour that her son had stolen the cellphone. Ronit was nursing a grudge against my son after he refused to lend him money. Kaushik was in his Budge Budge office at the time when he was supposed to be selling the cellphone to Ronit for Rs 400, she alleged.        
	The next day, a gang of 16 youths called Kaushik out from his home and assaulted him in front of his parents. They had promised to amicably resolve the dispute but then started raining blows on him. The boys were all drunk, and took turns hitting our son. We tried to intervene but were pushed away, cried the father.        
	Kaushiks parents named eight of the assailants in the FIR filed on October 15, 2008. The list included Arup Das, whose cellphone was allegedly stolen. I can identify the rest by their faces if they are paraded, Kaushiks father had then told the police.        
	While the police allegedly dragged their feet on the probe, Kaushik died of multiple organ failure on January 17 this year, three months after being assaulted.        
	According to the court order asking the police to file a fresh chargesheet, documents furnished by the complainant primarily show that his son was under continuous medical treatment even after his discharge from hospital.

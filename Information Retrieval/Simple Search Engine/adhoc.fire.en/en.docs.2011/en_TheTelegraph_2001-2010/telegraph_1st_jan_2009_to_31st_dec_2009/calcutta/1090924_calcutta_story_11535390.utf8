                The high court on Wednesday rejected the bail plea of Vedic Village owner Raj K. Modi. This was the second time Modis bail plea was rejected by the high court. Modi was arrested on August 29 for attempt to murder, forgery and grabbing land from farmers of Sikharpur in Rajarhat. The bench of Justice D.P. Sengupta and Justice S.K. Chakrabarti rejected Modis plea after the public prosecutor submitted that the state had lodged 13 more criminal cases against him.     The Calcutta University syndicate on Wednesday approved a proposal to admit students to all postgraduate courses through entrance tests from the next academic session. The syndicate will frame rules for the tests after the Puja vacation. The decision follows a court ruling that implied that CU would have to follow the same rules for admitting students from its affiliates as well as autonomous colleges.    Sanjay Wadvani, the British deputy high commissioner in India, inaugurated an environment department booth themed on climate change near the Tridhara Sammilani puja on Wednesday. The department has set up several such booths, called Sabuj Thikana (Green Destination), near popular pandals.     The civic authorities have formed a team of drainage workers headed by an engineer at each of its 15 borough offices to tackle waterlogging-related problems during Puja. The teams would be on alert round the clock and the CMC control room would remain open during Puja, said municipal commissioner Arnab Roy. The CMC control room can be reached at 22861212 and 22861313.

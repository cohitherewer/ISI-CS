The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Result divides family
                                                                                                               Result divides family
          RITH BASU                          Bina Bhattacharya, whose three sons are with the Trinamul Congress while one is a CPM worker, fears for her familys unity in the wake of the verdict.   Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                        
	Bina Bhattacharya voted for Mamata Banerjee. But as other Trinamul supporters were painting the town green after the fall of the red citadel, this 75-year-old matriarch of a Kalighat family was as worried for her family as she was happy for Mamata.        
	I am a mother first, and my thoughts were elsewhere. The youngest of my four sons is a CPM worker and I knew that the results would leave him devastated. Worse, I feared his three brothers would keep rubbing it in and that would break my family, she told Metro.        
	Bina presides over a united family occasionally divided by political allegiance. She and the older three of her four sons who stay together are Trinamul Congress supporters. The youngest, Nilim, has been with the CPM and was even a polling agent on election day.        
	Bina had left for her sisters house in Haridevpur on Saturday morning to avoid being in the middle of the unpleasantness that she knew the election results would bring. When she returned, her four sons were at the dinner table. Ma, tomar chhoto chheleke jiggesh koro ora kota pelo (Ma, ask your youngest son how many seats they won? taunted the eldest, 50-year-old Haripada.        
	Siblings Dilip, 46, and Shantanu, 42, chuckled. Binas eyes were on 40-year-old Nilim. I was praying he wouldnt retort, and he didnt, Bina recalled.        
	To her relief, the tension in the household eased considerably on Sunday. When my husband died, Haripada was 15 and Nilim only five. Haripada couldnt complete his education but made sure Nilim completed his. I am proud that they are together despite their political differences.        
	Nilim is a clerk at Netaji Nagar College and Dilip is a priest at the Kalighat temple. Haripada works with the food and supplies department and Shantanu is unemployed.        
	According to Bina, politics has even been a binding factor in the joint family. At least they (the brothers) have something to talk about. So many brothers I see are not even on talking terms.         
	Haripada said he was apprehensive about his 16-year-old son Shuvam taking to the Left like his chhotokaka. My son is closer to Nilim than me. Thank god Nilims political leanings havent influenced him yet.        
	Bina said political debates were a regular affair. It was worse when Haripada was with the Congress. Then I had to deal with three views.        
	But the mother rarely plays referee. Not until it gets so noisy that my grandchildren are disturbed while studying, she laughed.

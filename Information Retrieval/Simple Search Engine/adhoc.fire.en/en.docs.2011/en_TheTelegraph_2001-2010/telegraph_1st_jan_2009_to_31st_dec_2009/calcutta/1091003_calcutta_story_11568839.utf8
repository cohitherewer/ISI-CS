          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 35-year-old Patna resident was arrested at Howrah station on Friday morning with silver bars weighing 56kg for which he did not have documents.        
	Police said GRP officers became suspicious after seeing Suresh Yadav get off the Danapur-Howrah Express and drag a bag down the platform with great effort. The bars were in the bag.        
	Yadav told the cops that he was a resident of Patna and was taking the bars to a man at Burrabazar in Calcutta.         
	Tanmoy Roy Choudhury, the superintendent of railway police, said: Yadav was arrested for carrying silver for which he could not produce any document.

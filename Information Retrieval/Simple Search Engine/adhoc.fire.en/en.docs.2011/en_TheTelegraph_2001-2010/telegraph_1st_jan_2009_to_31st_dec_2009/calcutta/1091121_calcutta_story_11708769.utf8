The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Firemen rue lack of masks
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Firemen rue lack of masks
          SUBHAJOY ROY               
	Machines seem to be important to the fire department but not the men who use them. The West Bengal Fire and Emergency Services has spent around Rs 30 crore in the past year to modernise its fleet but has left its men ill-equipped.        
	Ninety-odd fire tenders of varying capacities have been bought and another 30 will be added to the fleet soon. A skylift and ladders will also be bought, said a senior official at the fire services head office in Free School Street.         
	A number of tenders were bought in the past few months. But if our bosses show a little more concern about the maintenance of personnel protection gear, it would help us perform better and also keep us safe, said a fireman.         
	Personnel protection gear includes breathing masks and fire proximity suits. The fire services top brass claimed enough masks were available, but those in the line of fire said the masks were defunct.         
	The breathing masks currently being used were bought in the mid-1990s. A source in the fire department said each divisional headquarters was given 10 sets and each station one or two masks. Most masks have become unusable because of improper maintenance, said a source in the department.         
	The two divisional headquarters in Calcutta proper have seven to eight masks each that are functional, but those outside the city have almost none, he added.        
	The fire minister, however, said there were enough masks. The defunct ones can be re-used after repairs, said fire minister Pratim Chatterjee.         
	The procurement of fire proximity suits has been put on hold. We floated a tender in mid-2008 but were not satisfied with the quality of the suits available. Since such suits may endanger the lives of our fire fighters, we didnt take a chance, said D.P. Biswas, the additional director- general of fire services.         
	Sources in fire services told Metro only two suits were available for firemen. But they are used only during training, he said.         
	Firemen regularly suffer from breathing problems and itching in the eyes after long hours on duty. We have become habituated with the fumes and do not think about masks anymore, said a fireman.

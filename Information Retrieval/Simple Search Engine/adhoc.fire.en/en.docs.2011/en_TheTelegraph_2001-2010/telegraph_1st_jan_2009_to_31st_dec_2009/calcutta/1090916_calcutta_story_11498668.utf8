The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | JU teachers strike work for pay hike
                                                                                                               JU teachers strike work for pay hike
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Classes were suspended in all three faculties of Jadavpur University on Tuesday after teachers launched an agitation demanding the immediate implementation of enhanced pay scales as recommended by the central ministry of human resource development.         
	The protest was organised by the CPM-backed Jadavpur University Teachers Association. Association members said the state was unable to increase their pay as the Centre had not released the necessary funds.         
	The Centre was supposed to pay 80 per cent of the enhanced basic pay of teachers for four-and-a-half years. But the Centre has not released any money for this yet, said Keshab Bhattacharya, the general secretary of the association.         
	The teachers also pointed out a number of anomalies in an order released by the state on August 28 announcing its decision to increase teachers pay. The teachers said the Centre had recommended that teachers pay be hiked with effect from January 1, 2006, but the order didnt mention payment of arrears. The order was also silent on the promotion benefits of teachers and the pay scales of readers who have joined after January 1, 2006, the teachers said.        
	After the pay hike, the initial gross salary of a lecturer would be raised from Rs 15,000 a month to around Rs 24,000 and the minimum gross salary of a professor would be raised from Rs 37,000 to Rs 47,000.        
	School protest: Teachers of Elias Meyer School, an English-medium private school in Bowbazar, held a sit-in outside the school gate protesting the refusal of the authorities to increase their salaries as recommended by the Fifth Pay Commission. The teachers said the authorities issued a notice stating their inability to hike their pay.

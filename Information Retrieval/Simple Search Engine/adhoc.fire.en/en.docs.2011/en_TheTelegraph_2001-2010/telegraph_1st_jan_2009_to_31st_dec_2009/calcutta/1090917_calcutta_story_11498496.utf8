The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Panel to scan masters courses in colleges
                                                                                                               Panel to scan masters courses in colleges
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The state higher education council has set up a committee to review the performance and infrastructure of colleges offering masters degrees in arts, science and commerce.         
	There are reports that a number of colleges offering postgraduate courses in the state do not have the resources to teach such courses, said an official of the council.        
	Nearly 80 colleges in Bengal, more than 25 of them in and around Calcutta, have been allowed to run postgraduate courses since 2001.         
	Apart from Calcutta University, West Bengal State University, Barasat, North 24 Parganas, Burdwan University, North Bengal University and Kalyani University have affiliates offering postgraduate degrees.        
	In some of the colleges, there are only part-time teachers to take postgraduate classes. Laboratories have not been upgraded to the desired level in some colleges.        
	The council intends to frame guidelines to stop such irregularities, said the official. The issue was discussed at a recent meeting of the council.        
	The panel is the first attempt to monitor postgraduate courses run by colleges.        
	After examining the condition of the colleges, the committee will submit a report to the council suggesting methods to upgrade the institutions. The suggestions will be discussed by the heads of universities. Once the vice-chancellors give their views on the suggestions, the council will finalise the guidelines, which every college offering postgraduate courses will have to follow, said Subimal Sen, the council chairman.        
	The colleges that want to offer postgraduate courses are currently required to follow the rules of the university to which they are affiliated. A guideline is necessary because the rules differ from university to university, said an official.         
	The council has a plan to maintain regular vigil on the colleges, added the official.        
	According to Sen, more colleges will have to be given permission to run postgraduate courses, considering the growing demand to pursue masters degrees.         
	Colleges teaching masters courses should have research facilities for students. It is important for the colleges to have qualified faculty members and maintain high academic standard, said a member of the council.

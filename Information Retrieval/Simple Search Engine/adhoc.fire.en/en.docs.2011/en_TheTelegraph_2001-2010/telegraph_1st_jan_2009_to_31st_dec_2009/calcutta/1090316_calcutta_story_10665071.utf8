The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Anthem snag a mystery
                                                                                                               Anthem snag a mystery
          KINSUK BASU                          Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi delivers a speech in the Assembly in 2008. A Telegraph picture                                  
	The government has failed to identify the March 9 snag in the Assemblys audio system and termed it mysterious.        
	The snag on the inaugural day of the budget session had stopped Dhana Dhanye Pushpey Bhara, and later the national anthem, from being played. Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi led the MLAs in singing Jana Gana Mana.        
	Senior engineers scanned the building but could not detect any technical fault. Nor were there any flaws with the cables or the music system. The snag remains a mystery, said an engineer of the public works department (PWD), which has closed the case.        
	The PWD report has not held anyone responsible for the lapse but recommended a few measures for the proper upkeep of the audio and public address systems of the Assembly. The report has also called for an end to the practice of allowing caretakers to run the systems in the absence of engineers.        
	The decades-old audio system is connected to the mains through a bunch of cables which are apparently replaced every year.        
	The probe revealed that on March 9, two assistant engineers from the PWD and the information and cultural affairs department had conducted a trial an hour before the governor arrived and found the audio system to be fine. The duo then left, asking two caretakers to play the tunes.        
	The report states that a marshal had suggested that the volume be lowered while the trial was on. So, there doesnt seem to be any problem, said PWD minister Kshiti Goswami.        
	Two executive engineers of the departments were in their rooms in the Assembly complex when the audio system malfunctioned but could do nothing as there were too many VIPs in the hall, the report says. It was not possible to vacate the hall and run a check on the electrical system, said an official.        
	While the PWD looks after the wires and the power connections in the Assembly, the information and cultural affairs department is responsible for the audio and public address systems.        
	From now on, executive engineers of both departments will ensure that everything is in order while the session is on, said a PWD official.        
	The report suggests that an assistant engineer from both departments be present in the hall during the proceedings.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Seven more positive for flu
                                                                                                               Seven more positive for flu
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Visitors wear masks at Beleghata Infectious Diseases Hospital                                  
	Three members of a family were among the seven persons who tested positive for swine flu on Sunday. Altogether, 39 people have contracted the H1N1 virus in the city.        
	Mridul Sengupta, 52, wife Piyali, 38, and their 12-year-old son Sourashish became the first swine flu victims in the city who were allowed to be treated at home. The Ashoknagar residents were released from Infectious Diseases Hospital after they signed a risk bond.        
	Since their infection is not severe, they can be quarantined at home and treated, a health department official said.        
	The others who tested positive were Arnab Bannerjee, 34, Agnibina Chatterjee, 11, Navrit Singh, 22, and Hari Lama, 31.        
	The state health department on Sunday issued a circular asking the swine flu clinics to give priority to four categories of suspects for tests.        
	The four groups are persons below five years and above 55 years of age; pregnant woman and people suffering from diseases like asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiac disorder and diabetes; those suffering from diarrhoea and respiratory distress; and patients showing classic symptoms of severe H1N1 infection.        
	All swine flu clinics have been asked to give priority to these groups of suspects while sending swabs for test, said Tapas Sen, the nodal officer for swine flu in the state.        
	G.B. Nair, the director of Niced (Calcutta), said the number of samples being sent to the institute has gone up sharply, creating a backlog. Niced can handle 45 samples in eight hours or 135 in a day. We have to prioritise as the number of samples is much more than what we can handle. The samples of those showing severe symptoms should be tested while others can be treated symptomatically, Nair said. Niced is planning to procure rapid test kits from Mumbai.        
	Protective gear: Schools are buying protective masks in an attempt to prevent the spread of swine flu on the campuses.        
	The Heritage School has procured 150 masks. The nurses and other staff members in the infirmary are wearing masks. Students, too, will be given masks if they are found to be suffering from swine flu, said principal Seema Sapru.        
	Schools such as Mahadevi Birla, Modern High, Calcutta Girls and Birla High (for both boys and girls) are sending students running a temperature back home.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Humidity breaks Celsius fall
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Humidity breaks Celsius fall
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A slight rise in humidity and a feeble western disturbance pushed up the mercury a bit on Tuesday, though the minimum temperature was still two degrees below normal at 11.7.        
	The minimum temperature on Monday was 10.8 degrees Celsius.        
	A feeble western disturbance is passing through the region, temporarily pushing up the humidity on Tuesday, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.        
	The higher humidity level, which rose to a maximum of 96 per cent during the day, is likely to cause mist on Wednesday morning and keep the mercury from falling.        
	The weatherman, however, held out hope for New Year, predicting a renewed slide in temperature from December 31 night or early on January 1.        
	No major change in the minimum temperature is likely across the eastern plains during the next couple of days. Last weeks weather condition is likely to be restored by January 1, said an official of the India Meteorological Department in Delhi.        
	Met experts are yet to find indications of a strong western disturbance, which helps drag down the mercury, blowing across south Bengal in the next few days.        
	But thats no reason to assume that the chill is bidding a premature adieu to Calcutta.        
	There are strong possibilities that the city is headed for the coldest winter in recorded Met history. Theres still enough time, over the next two months, for the mercury to plunge to the 8-9 degree mark, said a senior scientist at the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting in Noida.

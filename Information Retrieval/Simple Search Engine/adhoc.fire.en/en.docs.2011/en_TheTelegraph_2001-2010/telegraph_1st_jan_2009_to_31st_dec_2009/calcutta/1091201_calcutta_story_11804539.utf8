The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Only business class for MP 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Only business class for MP 
          SANJAY MANDAL                                    Union minister Sultan Ahmed and his party chief Mamata Banerjee.                                   
	Trinamul Congress minister Sultan Ahmed and his supporters created a furore at the airport on Monday morning to force Air India to upgrade his economy class ticket to Delhi, making a mockery of Mamata Banerjees call for austerity.        
	The Trinamul chief and another party MP and minister, Sisir Adhikary, flew to Delhi in the economy class in the afternoon.        
	Ahmed, the Union minister of state for tourism, was booked in the economy class of AI 111 and was allotted a front row seat.        
	After arriving at the airport, the minister went to the Air India check-in counter and asked airline employees to upgrade his ticket. The employees were reluctant to upgrade the ticket but his aides, who had come to see him off, started to shout at them, said an airport official.         
	The 10.30am take-off was already delayed as passengers and crew members reached the airport late because of the bandh. With Ahmed and his supporters adding to the chaos and the queue of passengers lengthening, Air India employees gave in and allotted the MP seat 1F in the business class.        
	As a Union minister I am entitled to travel business class. Where does Trinamul come in? It is a convention that if the economy class is full, the passengers are upgraded to the business class. The airline did the same for me and there was nothing wrong, Ahmed told Metro from Delhi.        
	Airport sources, however, said there were only 90 passengers for the 140 economy class seats on the flight. The business class had 20 seats.         
	The minister was upgraded because he insisted, said a source.        
	Air India had recently sent a circular asking employees not to oblige passengers who request an upgrade since the airline was facing a financial crunch.         
	Mamata had said several times in rallies that she and her party MPs were on an austerity drive, as part of which they travelled economy class.        
	Around 5pm on Monday, she and Adhikary took AI 201 to Delhi. They were allotted front row seats in the economy class.        
	Trinamul MPs generally travel economy class, said an Air India official.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who is entitled to travel business class, also flies economy class.

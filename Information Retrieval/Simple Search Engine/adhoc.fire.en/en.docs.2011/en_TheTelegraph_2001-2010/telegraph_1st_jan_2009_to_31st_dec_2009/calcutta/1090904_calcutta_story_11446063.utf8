The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Harass probe at JU
                                                                                                               Harass probe at JU
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The sexual harassment cell of Jadavpur University has started a probe against a teacher of the international relations department following an anonymous complaint from a student.        
	The MA Part-II student has alleged in her letter to the cell that the teacher had promised her high scores in the exams if she spent time with him after class and admission to the doctoral programme if she accompanied him on a trip during the Puja vacation.        
	The complaint was promptly taken up by the cell. We have started a probe and talked to the teacher once. Further investigation is necessary to find out whether the allegation is true or not, said Sipra Raha, a member of the sexual harassment cell.        
	The student has not disclosed her name fearing reprisal but mentioned in the complaint what her special paper is, said an official.        
	Following a Supreme Court order, the University Grants Commission (UGC) has made it mandatory for every college and university to take prompt action if there is a complaint of sexual harassment.         
	The order came into effect at Jadavpur University more than three years ago, with the authorities setting up a sexual harassment cell to look into complaints from students, and teachers and other employees.        
	A section of teachers, however, is against the inquiry, saying the authorities should ensure faculty members are not harassed following vague allegations conveyed through anonymous letters.        
	There is no question of tolerating sexual harassment on campus. But the authorities must see to it that the Supreme Court order is not misused by those who want to settle scores with teachers or colleagues, said a teacher who did not want to be named.        
	Asked about the complaint, vice-chancellor P.N Ghosh said: I have no clue because such complaints come directly to the sexual harassment cell, which operates according to UGC guidelines.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Plans for 3 more stations
                                                                                                               Plans for 3 more stations
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The railway standing committee of Parliament has proposed three more terminals in Calcutta to cope with the increasing passenger rush. The city now has four terminals  Howrah, Sealdah, Shalimar and Chitpur.        
	In the proposal sent to the ministry we have said the city needs at least three more terminals, which we want in Patipukur and Howrahs Salt Gola for the Eastern Railway (ER) and Majherhat for the South Eastern Railway (SER), panel chief Basudeb Acharya said.        
	The two ER terminals will run only suburban trains, while the one in Majherhat will be for long-distance trains.        
	With an annual eight percent growth in passenger count, the three major terminals  Howrah, Sealdah and Chitpur  will be saturated within a few years. There had been proposals to set up passenger terminals in Patipukur and Majherhat which were scrapped. Its time they were revived, said Acharya.        
	On the proposed Majherhat terminal, Acharya said it could be an alternative to the one in Shalimar which most passengers find difficult to reach because of transport problems.        
	Railway officials said a survey was on for building passenger terminals in the city. The survey, being conducted by RITES, is exploring the options of building up integrated passenger-cargo terminals and also whether such facilities could be shared with the Metro Railway, an official said.        
	The ER has already sent a proposal for the Salt Gola terminal to the Railway Board. The proposed facility will go a long way in reducing passenger load once Howrah station is upgraded into a world-class terminal, said an ER official.         
	The standing committee members, who met senior ER and SER officials on Saturday, said the ministry had been asked to bear 75 per cent of the cost for building overbridges on railway tracks. Now, the cost is shared equally by the state government and the railways.

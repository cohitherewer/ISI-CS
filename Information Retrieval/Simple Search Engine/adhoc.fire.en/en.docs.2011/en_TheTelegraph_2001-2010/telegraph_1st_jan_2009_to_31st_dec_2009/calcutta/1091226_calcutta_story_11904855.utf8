The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | JU job policy under review
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      JU job policy under review
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jadavpur University is set to tighten a two-decade-old teacher recruitment policy that allegedly leaves the door ajar for even the least qualified candidate to land a job on the basis of one good interview.        
	The decision to bring clarity and transparency to the recruitment process comes close on the heels of the head of the department of geology resigning in protest against a teacher being allegedly appointed over a more qualified candidate. Similar allegations were earlier raised about recruitment of teachers in the history and international relations departments.        
	Appointments are made on the basis of rules framed in 1986. Several amendments need to be made in keeping with the changes in the education sector over the past 23 years, Parthapratim Biswas, a member of the universitys executive council, told Metro.        
	A recent meeting of the executive council discussed the controversies surrounding some appointments and decided to initiate a debate on possible amendments to the recruitment policy. There has to be clarity in the process of selection of teachers. The present system mentions certain basic criteria but there is no clause in the university statutes stating on what basis a candidate should be finally selected, a member argued.        
	The University Act would have to be amended and passed in the Assembly for the recruitment criteria to change.        
	Vice-chancellor P.N. Ghosh said the proposal to overhaul the appointment rules was in the preliminary stage of discussion. The University Grants Commission has also drafted some new rules for the selection of teachers. We can consider making changes to our policy in tune with the UGC proposals, he added.        
	A senior Jadavpur University teacher said it was unfair that a candidate less qualified and experienced than another could make the grade under the present rules by performing well in the interview. There should be a section in the university statute clearly stating the weightage for interviews and educational qualifications.

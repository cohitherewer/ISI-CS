	Class XII students of the state board will no longer have to fill up the examination form to sit for the school-leaving test.        
	The Higher Secondary board has already started sending forms with the particulars of students printed on them to schools. If the data available with the board is correct, students will have to only sign the form. The board will issue HS admit cards after receiving the signed forms.         
	If there is a mistake in the printed form, students will have to provide the correct information in the corresponding blank column. Filled-up forms often contain careless mistakes. The rectification of the errors delays the examination process, said Onkar Sadhan Adhikary, the board president.        
	As students provide most of the information sought in the exam form during registration (after admission in Class XI), the board has decided to only verify the data, said an official.

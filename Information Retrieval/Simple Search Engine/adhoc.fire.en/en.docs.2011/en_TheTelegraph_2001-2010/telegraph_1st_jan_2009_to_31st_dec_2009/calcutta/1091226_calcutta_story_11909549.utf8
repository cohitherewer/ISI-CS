	Christmas dawned crisp and sunny on Friday and Calcutta came out in droves to soak in the festive fun. A Metro round-up of the popular hang-out zones                          Alipore zoo      
	Place: Alipore zoo        
	Time: 12.30pm         
	The scene outside: It was hard to distinguish the entrance of the Alipore Zoological Gardens from the gates at Eden Gardens during an international cricket match.         
	Inside: All patches of green were teeming with families enjoying the winter sun.        
	The drop in temperature has made our day out even more enjoyable, smiled schoolteacher Subrata Banerjee, who was accompanied by his wife, daughter and mother.         
	As usual, the lion and tiger enclosures were the centres of attraction for kids. But the uncommon star this year was the Common Marmoset.        
	We read so much in the newspapers about the marmosets being stolen that we were very keen to take a look at them, said Tripti Sarkar, a college student.         
	Authorityspeak: The zoo recorded the seasons highest footfall on Friday. There were 50,000 visitors today, almost the same as last year, said zoo director Raju Das.         
	The zoo is open every day till January-end. Otherwise, it is closed on Thursdays.                          Millennium Park      
	Place: Millennium Park:         
	Time: 2pm        
	The scene outside: The crowds trickled into the amusement park that was closed for a couple of months around Puja because of labour trouble.         
	Inside: Children enjoyed the rides while the elders basked in the sun. We are happy that Millennium Park has re-opened. The cool breeze from the river feels lovely, said Kaushik Dutta, who came with his wife and two kids.         
	Authorityspeak: The footfall this Christmas was lower than last years. Many people are still not aware that we have reopened, said Titu Saha, a member of the managing committee. The park recorded a footfall of 29,000 on Friday.               
	Place: Victoria Memorial        
	Time: 3.30pm        
	The scene outside: A long queue wound itself around the boundary, waiting to buy tickets. At present there are almost 2,000 people waiting to enter, said a police officer.         
	Inside: Visitors sat on the grounds, chatting and enjoying the weather. But no one was allowed to enter with food, plastic bags or newspapers. But some manage to sneak in with banned items as its not possible to keep an eye on every visitor, said the officer.        
	The Victoria Memorial authorities could not be contacted but a cop said over 20,000 tickets were sold on Friday.

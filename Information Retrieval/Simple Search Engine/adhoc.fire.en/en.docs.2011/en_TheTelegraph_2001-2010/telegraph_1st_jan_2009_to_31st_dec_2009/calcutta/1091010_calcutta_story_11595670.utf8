	The body of a 21-year-old homemaker who died under mysterious circumstances has been lying in a morgue for the past eight days while her husband and in-laws have been in hiding.        
	Preeti Devi, a resident of Nabin Pally at Rishra in Hooghly district was brought unconscious to AMRI Hospitals in Dhakuria late on September 27 by her husband Anil Jaiswal.        
	She was admitted to the emergency ward and put on ventilator after being diagnosed with multiple organ failure, a spokesperson for the hospital said.        
	Anil, who deals in garments, visited the hospital for the last time the next morning. He hasnt been seen since.        
	Suman Ghosh, the medical superintendent, said Preeti died around 6pm on October 1.         
	According to the hospitals report to the police, Anil had claimed that Preeti, his wife of five months, took ill after having dinner at home on September 25. He took her to an unidentified hospital, where her condition worsened over the next two days.        
	By the time she was brought to us, the young womans central nervous system, heart, liver and other vital organs had almost ceased to function, said a hospital official.         
	Anil deposited Rs 5,000 while admitting Preeti to AMRI Hospitals.        
	The family is in hiding for some reason, said D. Baidya, the officer-in-charge of Lake police station.        
	Investigators at Lake police station are co-ordinating with their counterparts at Rishra police station to trace the absconding family.        
	We suspect foul play, said Debnath Sadhukhan, an officer at Rishra police station.         
	Representatives of AMRI Hospitals and the police separately visited the rented house of the Jaiswals at Nabin Pally but found it locked.        
	Gopesh Ranjan Roy, the son of landlord Gurudas Roy, said the family had moved in only two months ago. He also confirmed that Preeti was taken to a local hospital before being shifted to AMRI.        
	A couple of days after that, Anil, his brother Arun, father Shyam Sundar and others locked up the house and vanished. Their belongings, including furniture, are still there. We tried contacting them but their cellphones have been switched off, Roy said.         
	Anil had told the landlord while renting the house that he was from Varanasi and ran a garments store on Rawdon Street.        
	Nothing is known of Preetis family yet.

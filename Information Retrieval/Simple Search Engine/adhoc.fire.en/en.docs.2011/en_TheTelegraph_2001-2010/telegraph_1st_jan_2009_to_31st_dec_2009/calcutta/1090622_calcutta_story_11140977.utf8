The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Lalgarh SOS to hospitals
                                                                                                               Lalgarh SOS to hospitals
  - First batch of patients chooses private instead of state facility           SANJAY MANDAL                          Liaqat Ali, the police driver injured in a landmine blast at Lalgarh, being wheeled into a private hospital in Dhakuria on Saturday evening. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                         
	The first batch of injured from battleground Lalgarh was wheeled into a private hospital rather than one of the state-run medical colleges that have been turning away patients to keep beds free for those in the line of Maoist fire.        
	Four police personnel injured in Fridays landmine blast near Pirakata were brought straight to AMRI Hospitals, Dhakuria. But only one of them, 49-year-old driver Liaqat Ali, required hospitalisation.        
	Sources said the AMRI authorities were informed in advance that some injured policemen were being brought to the hospital. We discharged three of them after treatment and admitted Liaqat Ali because he suffered splinter injuries to his head, said Suman Ghosh, the medical superintendent of AMRI.         
	Two government hospitals, SSKM and Medical College and Hospital, were the other choices.        
	SSKM has reserved around 40 beds in various wards for patients from the battle zone. On Saturday, all medical officers on the roster were officially instructed not to allot any of those beds to patients other than those brought from Lalgarh and its adjoining areas.         
	We are required to keep around 40 beds ready for a disaster-related emergency at all times but it is not always possible to do so. But this time we have decided to strictly implement the instructions. If this means turning away some patients, we dont have a choice, said Pradip Mitra, the director of the Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research.        
	S. Banerjee, the director of medical services, said on Sunday that arrangements to treat those injured in Lalgarh had been made in every hospital with the requisite infrastructure. We have beds ready in the medical colleges at Midnapore and Bankura, too, he told Metro.        
	Private hospitals other than AMRI are also preparing their trauma care teams for an emergency. We are conducting mock drills to keep our trauma care units on alert, said Rupali Basu, the CEO of Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, Calcutta.        
	Driver Liaqat Alis boss Amit Javalgi, the sub-divisional police officer of Domkol in Murshidabad, was among the injured brought to AMRI on Saturday. He and one of his bodyguards, Ajit Pal, have been advised surgery after a fortnight to repair perforated ear drums. Another bodyguard, Panchanan Roy, suffered minor injuries in the landmine blast.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 3D thrill for kids but science facts askew
                                                                                                                   3D thrill for kids but science facts askew
										                                  (From top): Stills from the 3D IMAX movie, Fly Me to the Moon              
	Watching a 3D movie in the IMAX format will always be a thrill for kids. Fly Me to the Moon holds much excitement for small children, especially the pre-primary level ones. The film is about three common houseflies who, looking for some adventure, hop aboard the Apollo11 spacecraft on its way to the Moon.         
	The film cannot be categorised as edutainment, as it disregards basic scientific truths. Apart from the close approach to the Moon and the actual landing, the films plot has no basis in reality.         
	Any space mission has to undergo so many rigorous tests that three flies hitchhiking on the lunar module is not just absurd, but also gives a wrong idea of the preparation required for such a launch.         
	The overemphasis on a sinister Soviet plot to sabotage the mission is ridiculous and harks back to the cynicism of the Cold War period. Soviet Russia is no more and even children today are aware of international collaborative efforts, often between Russia and the United States, in space research and exploration. They might be confused by the level of animosity shown between the two powers.         
	The 3D format is enjoyable, but one cannot expect children to learn anything new from it about mans first landing on the Moon.         
	The movie lacks scientific temper and can only be treated as summer entertainment on an evenings outing for only primary schoolchildren. We still have to wait for a film that sticks to the historical and scientific truth for kids. The movie can best be termed a 3D masala movie meant for kids.

	A talent hunt for promising pace bowlers in Bengal, Dabur Glucose-D TTIS Ace of Pace, organised in association with The Telegraph in Schools (TTIS), saw city and district boys vying for a date with pace bowler Zaheer Khan and training at the Videocon School of Cricket in Salt Lake.         
	It is divided into two categories  junior (classes VI-IX) and senior (classes X to XII)  and one from each will finally make it from Bengal. The trials took place in Midnapore, Bankura, Durgapur, Asansol, Siliguri, Purulia and Calcutta.         
	About 5,000 boys participated from the districts. Another 4,000 were from Calcutta, including about 60 from city schools like La Martiniere for Boys, National High School for Boys and The Heritage School. The trial was followed by a spot quiz on cricket.         
	A wild card entry was also held at Vivekananda Park and Subhas Sarobar on May 8, 9 and 10, for boys whose schools missed the competition and for those from coaching camps.        
	The selection is made on the bowlers speed, accuracy and consistency, said selector Niloy Saha, the umpire of North 24-Parganas District Sports Association, at Subhas Sarobar on Sunday.        
	While the Calcutta final happened on Tuesday and will continue the next day, with 140 boys participating in the selection, the all-Bengal final will be on May 23. We want to glean fresh talent and give equal opportunity to those from the districts, said an organiser.         
	The competition might be tough, but the students are ready. I practise five days a week and if I get a chance to meet Zaheer Khan, it will be a dream come true. Ill take tips from him and ask him how he swings the old ball, said Sumanta Roy of Apeejay School, Park Street, selected in the preliminary round in the senior category.              
	Stage is where the action is

	Students from more than 20 schools met on two days at GD Birla Sabhagar to participate in three contests organised by South Point High School (SPHS), under the MP Birla Foundation Smarak Kosh: Masquerade, a feast of original one-act plays, Q-Point, where the best brains were pitted in a quiz, and Satrangi, a singing competition. An essay competition, Perceptum, was also organised on May 2 in English, Hindi and Bengali, where students wrote on subjects like a style gurus trials of keeping up with latest fads and the myths of stardom.        
	Held on May 3, Masquerade saw 10 schools taking the stage for the MP Birla trophy. Within a time limit of 20 minutes, students performed on subjects as varied as the harsh demands of everyday life that overshadow the small pleasures of living and the environment. While Birla High School for Girls turned an old fairy tale on its head, with a manipulative Cinderella who is not beyond twisting the truth a little to get her prince, Carmel High Schools Stars Shine Down was about ordinary women with extraordinary souls. The host school was declared the winner for their play, Reality Bytes, with Shri Daulatram Nopany Vidyalayas The Omen and Shri Shikshayatans Together Towards Tomorrow coming in second and third, respectively. Birla Highs performance stood out for their stylish costumes, including veiled hats and satin gowns, and props, like a brick fireplace with papier mache fire. We designed our own costumes and made our props by hand, said Class X student, Pallavi Goenka, playing one of the ugly sisters.        
	Carmel High acted with the ease of seasoned performers. We have been acting together for the past two years and can play to each others strengths, said Shravasti Dasgupta, who played an angel.         
	In Q-Point, held on May 2, SPHS again emerged the winner among 20 schools, bagging Rs 12,000 for their efforts. With seven rounds and eight finalists, it was a close call. Class XII student Anshuman Pal was selected the best quizzer. The runners-up, Birla High School for Boys and La Martiniere for Girls, received Rs 8,000 and Rs 5,000, respectively, as prizes.         
	Satrangi saw The Heritage win the trophy for best performance, with SPHS and Gokhale Memorial School placed as first and second runner up, respectively.

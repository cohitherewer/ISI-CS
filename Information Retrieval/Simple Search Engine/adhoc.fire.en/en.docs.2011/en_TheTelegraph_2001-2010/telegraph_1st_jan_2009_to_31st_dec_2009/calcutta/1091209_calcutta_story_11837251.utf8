The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Suicide nudges JU into action 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Suicide nudges JU into action 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The Jadavpur University (JU) authorities have decided to urge the state government to consider postgraduates in international relations for teaching jobs in political science in undergraduate colleges.        
	The move follows suicide by 27-year-old Apala Dey, a PhD scholar in international relations at JU, who had reportedly been depressed following the state college service commissions decision not to recruit her as a political science teacher.        
	Apala jumped in front of a Kavi Nazrul-bound train at Park Street Metro station around 7pm on Monday.        
	We will soon call a meeting of the teachers of the international relations department and discuss the problems faced by the students of the department in seeking teaching jobs in colleges, said JU pro vice-chancellor Sidhartha Dutta. The university, he added, will take up the matter with the state government once the teachers discuss the issue.        
	The college service commission has decided not to treat masters degree holders in international relations from JU on a par with those who have done an MA in political science.        
	Commission sources justified the stand by saying that the international relations syllabus of the university contained more history topics than that of political science.        
	Postgraduate students in JUs international relations department are in a fix over the commissions decision as no other university in the state offers the subject at the undergraduate level.        
	JU, on the other hand, does not have a postgraduate course in political science though it runs an honours course in the subject. Students who pass with honours in political science can apply for the masters course in international relations.         
	Till a few years ago, students with an MA in international relations from JU were allowed to teach political science at the undergraduate level.        
	The university should take immediate steps to ensure that masters degree holders in international relations are appointed as political science teachers in colleges, said a JU student.        
	Since an MA in international relations cannot fetch them a teachers job in political science in state colleges, several students and teachers of JU had demanded that the postgraduate course in international relations, introduced 50 years ago, be scrapped and replaced with a masters course in political science.

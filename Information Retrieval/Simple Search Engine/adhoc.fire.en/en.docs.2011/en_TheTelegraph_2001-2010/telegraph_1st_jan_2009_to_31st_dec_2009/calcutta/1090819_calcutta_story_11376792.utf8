The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Airport flyover plan awaits nod
                                                                                                               Airport flyover plan awaits nod
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The Airports Authority of India has submitted to the state government a plan for the proposed flyover connecting the upcoming integrated terminal building at the airport with VIP Road.        
	R. Srinivasan, the airport director, announced this after a meeting of the airport advisory committee on Tuesday. The panel met after four years to discuss issues related to passenger amenities and infrastructure, including the progress of the modernisation project.        
	We have received the plan from the Airports Authority of India and it will be finalised soon, said Sumantra Chowdhury, the principal secretary of the transport department.         
	The flyover will link the intersection of VIP Road and the airport connector with the arrival terminal, which will be on the first floor of the new building, said an airport official.        
	The Union minister of state for urban development Saugata Ray, the new chairman of the advisory committee, alleged the drainage outlets of the airport were choked, causing waterlogging in the operational areas.        
	According to airport officials, experts from Jadavpur University had conducted a survey and submitted a proposal to clear the choked outlets.        
	To solve the problem of jackals venturing into the runway and obstructing flights, the AAI will approach NGOs dealing with animal welfare, said an official.

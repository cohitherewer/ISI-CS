The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Ground reality of Metro project
                                                                                                               Ground reality of Metro project
          KINSUK BASU                              
	Engineers involved in the East-West Metro project would rather miss the 2012 deadline than mess with the drainage pipes, electricity lines and telecom cables criss-crossing Salt Lake.        
	Sources in the Calcutta Metro Railway Corporation, which is overseeing the project, blamed the unavailability of maps of underground utilities for the delay in starting construction.        
	Neither the urban development department nor the municipal authorities have been able to provide us with maps of underground utilities. We need to know exactly where the pipes and cables are before starting work on the piers (for the elevated portions of the route). Faulty digging will disrupt drainage, electricity and telecom services, an engineer said.        
	Top officials of the corporation will meet representatives of all the service providers, including the CESC and the state electricity board, and Bidhannagar Municipality on Thursday to work out a solution to the problem.        
	We have drawn up a map but that doesnt guarantee hassle-free construction. We cant say that there will be no disruption (of amenities). This is why we have decided to consult the service providers and the municipality before starting construction work, an official said.        
	He admitted that the Rs 4,874-crore project to connect Sector V in Salt Lake to Howrah should have got off the ground by now. Meeting the deadline will definitely be impossible if this issue drags on. So we are trying to resolve it as quickly as we can.        
	Parts of Salt Lake, including Sector V, are waterlogged every monsoon. The biggest challenge for the rail corporation is to ensure that once it starts, construction continues uninterrupted. For that to happen we need to make sure the drainage system functions well, the official said.         
	Drainage pipes running through some areas of the township  including Wipro, Karunamoyee, Bikash Bhawan, Central Park and City Centre  might have to be diverted to make way for the construction of pillars. Telecom and electric cables could also be shifted.         
	Unless our engineers are certain of the exact locations and ways to carry out the diversions, construction of the six elevated stations in and around Salt Lake cant take off, the official said.

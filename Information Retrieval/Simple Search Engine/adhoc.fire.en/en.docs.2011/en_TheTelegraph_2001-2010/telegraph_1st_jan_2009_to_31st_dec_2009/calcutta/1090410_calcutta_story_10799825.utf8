          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Middle-aged doctor Pritam Saha was arrested on Wednesday night in Sonarpur, on the southern city fringes, for allegedly molesting a 25-year-old patient admitted to his nursing home.         
	As news of the molestation spread, a mob attacked the nursing home and damaged Sahas car. The protesters also tried to burn down the nursing home. The cops rescued Saha, a general physician with a diploma in gynaecology, and later arrested him.        
	We arrested Pritam Saha under IPC Section 354 for molesting a woman and are interrogating him. We will also speak to the woman after she recovers from the shock, said Ajey Ranade, the superintendent of South 24-Parganas police.         
	The police said the woman underwent an appendix operation at New Belvue Nursing Home, run by Saha, on Tuesday night.         
	On Wednesday evening, when Somnath visited his wife, she broke down and told him the doctor had molested her on the pretext of examining her. At that time she did not raise an alarm out of fear, Somnath, a trader, told the police.        
	Somnath and his relatives confronted Saha about the incident, but the doctor denied it. Soon after, a mob gheraoed Saha and threatened him with dire consequences if he didnt confess to his crime. They demanded Saha apologise to the alleged victim.        
	A section of the mob soon started ransacking the nursing home. They also damaged Sahas car parked nearby and tried to set it on fire. Later they pushed the car into a pond. The men also assaulted the doctor.         
	Cops from Sonarpur police station reached the spot and rescued Saha. Later they arrested him following a complaint by Somnath and sealed the nursing home.

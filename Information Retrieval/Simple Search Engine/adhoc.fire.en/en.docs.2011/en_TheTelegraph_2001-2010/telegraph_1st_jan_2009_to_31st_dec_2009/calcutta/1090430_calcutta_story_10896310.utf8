                                                                                                               Man perches on terrace
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 28-year-old man perched himself on the edge of the terrace of the 12-storeyed building of the Indian Chamber of Commerce at India Exchange Place on Wednesday evening and refused to come down.        
	Traffic was blocked as a crowd gathered on the road while cops and firemen tried to persuade Basanta Polai, a Group D employee of the office, to step back.        
	We were ready with ladders but the police and our men spoke to him for half an hour and he went inside, said Gopal Bhattacharya, the director of fire and emergency services.        
	The resident of Orissa said he was depressed as his brothers had grabbed his share of their ancestral property.

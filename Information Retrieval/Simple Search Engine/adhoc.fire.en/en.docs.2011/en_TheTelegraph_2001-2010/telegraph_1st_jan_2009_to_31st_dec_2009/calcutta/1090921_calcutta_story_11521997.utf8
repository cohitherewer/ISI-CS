                      A different reality                    Abstraction indicates a departure from reality in depiction of artistic imagery. Abstracts, the ongoing group show by well-known artists, presents works that portray reality of a different kind. Whether partial, surreal or extra-sensory, the artists perception of reality offers an extraordinary view into a world of imagination and insight where life does not obey any rules of logic or rationality. Yet, they are far from being frivolous representations of the human world, and often reflect sober, serious truths about it. The artworks take liberties with reality in the sense that they alter instance, colour and form in conspicuous ways. Sunil Gawde and S. Harsha Vardhanas works bear no trace of any reference to anything recognisable, and are thus completely abstract. In Somenath Maitys paintings, the references to structures bring out the semi-abstractness. Rathin Kanjis and Samir Aichs works are similar to Maitys, as one is certain to discover references to naturalistic elements in their creations. Other participating artists: Amitava Sengupta, Partha Pratim Deb, Pradeep Rakshit and Dharmendra Rathore (a painting by him appears here).

                      Classical strings                    Paraguayan classical guitarist Berta Rojas is a musician who easily moves from classical to other genres. Whether working in collaboration, as with the legendary Carlos Barbosa-Lima, or as a soloist, Rojas has captivated music-lovers in the Americas , Europe and Asia. Most notably, she has appeared at both the Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall and the Frederick P. Rose Hall, home of Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York. Her performances at Washington D.C.s John F. Kennedy Center and the South Bank Centre in London was a complete sellout. In 1995 and 2005 she was the inaugural artiste at the International First Ladies Summit in Paraguay, the first one with special guest Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton. Praised by the Washington Post as a guitarist extraordinaire, her musicianship and cordiality made her a favourite at the renowned John Marlow Guitar Series in Washington DC. Rojas, is not just a sensational artiste of high technical ability; she also has a phenomenal and seemingly effortless style of playing. She is also committed to supporting South American music. This evening, this extraordinarily talented and versatile artiste will present a solo concert, for the first time in the city. Hosted by ICCR in collaboration with the Embassy of Paraguay.                    lEvent: Solo concert by classical guitarist Berta Rojas lWhen: Today at 6.30 pm lWhere: Satyajit Ray Auditorium, Indian Council for Cultural Relations, 9A Ho Chi Minh Sarani

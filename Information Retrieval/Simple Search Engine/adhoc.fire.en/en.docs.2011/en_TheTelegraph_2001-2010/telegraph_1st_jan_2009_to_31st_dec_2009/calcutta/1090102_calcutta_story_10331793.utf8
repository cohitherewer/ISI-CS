The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Friend held for youth murder
                                                                                                               Friend held for youth murder
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Sudipto Bhattacharya, the 22-year-old whose decomposed body was found near Bally station on December 21, was killed by two of his friends after their plan to kidnap him went awry, police claimed on Thursday.        
	One of the two, 28-year-old Amit Mondal, was arrested in his home in Kalitala, Baranagar, around 3.30am on Thursday. Police found one of the murder weapons, a razor, from a drain near his house.        
	The other friend, Sandip Bit of Alambazar in North 24-Parganas, was arrested earlier along with Sanatan Bhattacharya and Jagannath Shaw.        
	Sandip broke down during interrogation on Wednesday and admitted that he and Amit had wanted to abduct Sudipto for ransom. They murdered him when they failed to find a place to keep him, said Niraj Kumar Singh, the superintendent of Howrah police.        
	According to the police, financial crisis drove the two to crime. Sandip was unemployed since he came back from Delhi in August and Amit had suffered huge losses in the stock market, added Singh.        
	The duo had hatched a plan a month-and-a-half ago to abduct the Baranagar youth, who worked for a chain marketing company.        
	On December 17, the duo had asked Sudipto to reach Sinthee More in the evening. They went to the Central Chord Bridge near Bally station and sat down for a drink, said an officer.        
	After Sudipto became intoxicated, Amit stabbed him several times with the razor as Sandip held him. They then stuffed the body into a gunny bag and dumped it near the bridge. The ransom calls to Sudiptos father were made later.

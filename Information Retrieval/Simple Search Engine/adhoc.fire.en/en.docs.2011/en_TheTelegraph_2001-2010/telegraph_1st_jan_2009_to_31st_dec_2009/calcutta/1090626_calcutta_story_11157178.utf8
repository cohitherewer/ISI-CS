The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Poll plays spoilsport on party street
                                                                                                               Poll plays spoilsport on party street
  - Dry directive for ward 63 by-election stumps weekends dine-and-disc gang          KARO CHRISTINE KUMAR                                                  
	A bolt-from-the-blue order to be sober will leave the citys food-and-beverage streets high and dry this weekend.        
	The municipal bypoll this Sunday is playing party pooper with the Park Street-Camac Street-Theatre Road zone falling under ward 63, and therefore coming under purview of the dry day directive.        
	A notice from the excise department stating that all retail licensees within the territorial jurisdiction of ward number 63 of the CMC must be closed from Friday midnight till Sunday evening. Party people might be denied a wet Wednesday as well with counting day also declared dry till the bypoll is lost and won.        
	If a person just walks 10 yards down the road he gets liquor. So I cannot understand how this is protecting the electorate but I suppose we cant question the dry day, said Nitin Kothari, the vice-president of the Hotel amp; Restaurant Association of Eastern India. On a Saturday night, diners like a drink with their meal, so they may well opt for restaurants falling out of the dry spell area this weekend.        
	If restaurants on Park Street are bracing for a drop in footfall, late night hotspots have been forced to cancel special events or make alternative arrangements. At The Park, the decision to keep nightclubs open, serving mocktails and snacks, is still being debated.        
	Bunty Sethi has an escape clause as he owns Venom on Camac Street and Privy at Forum on Elgin Road. We didnt know (about the bypoll) till we got the notice. Were getting a lot of calls from our regulars, so we have shifted our Venom event to Privy (which is not in Ward 63).        
	Others are not so lucky. Nightclubs survive on Friday-Saturday footfalls. If these nights are closed, we lose 15 per cent of the months business, rued Sovan of Shisha.        
	 Saturday Club too falls within the no-liquor line. Our club bars will remain closed on Saturday and Sunday, said a representative of the Wood Street club.        
	Park Streets loss will be Lansdowne Road (Soho) and HHIs (Underground) gain. We are gearing up for a full house this Saturday, said Bambi of Underground.

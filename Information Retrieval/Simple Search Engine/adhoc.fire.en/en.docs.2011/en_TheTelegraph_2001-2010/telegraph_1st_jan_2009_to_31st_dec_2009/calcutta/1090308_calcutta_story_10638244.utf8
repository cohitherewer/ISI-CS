The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Looking back at Sharaku
                                                                                                               Looking back at Sharaku
										      eyewitness                        A contemporary self-portrait after Sharaku				                           
	In the year 1994, the Japanese celebrated the 200th anniversary of Toshusai Sharaku, an ukiyo-e artist of the Edo period, who, in an access of creativity between 1794 and 1795, produced 140 woodcut prints depicting bust portraits of the fiercely grimacing visages of kabuki actors.         
	These caricatures printed in brilliant colours and mica were never appreciated in Japan, but German scholar Julius Kurth rescued him from obscurity following his 1910 publication on the artist. This triggered off a Sharaku wave in the West.        
	The Japan Foundation organised the travelling exhibition, Sharaku interpreted by Japans Contemporary Artists, now on at the Academy of Fine Arts that includes posters by leading Japanese graphic designers, paintings by young contemporary artists and reproductions of Sharakus work.         
	The brilliant exhibition demonstrates that Sharaku still has a hold over the imaginations of avant garde artists and designers of today, himself having been a trailblazer.        
	The colours of most of Sharakus original prints have faded, and here we see them again in their polychromatic splendour. But the posters, where the designers appropriated features from actors maquillage  as exaggerated as that of a Kathakali artistes  show how something as simple as a rictus, an eye and a nose turn into design elements that the artist juggles around with, giving free play to imagination.         
	Facial features sprout out of a bamboo vase, turn into a menacing Mickey Mouse-like creature or emerge out of giant bubbles. A portrait turns into an ectoplasmic haze, or the letters of the artists name themselves metamorphose into a portrait.         
	Some of the faces look so simple yet it must have taken a group of hugely talented artists to think these up.        
	In the homage section, the contemporary artists superimpose photographs of themselves and friends on the original prints to give them a strikingly contemporary look.         
	Sometimes they exaggerate the features with paint and brush, in case somebody missed the point. Hairpieces are bunched together in another bold experiment, and the face itself turns into a giant blimp with an ominous giggle.        
	There are some three-dimensional art works too. The conjoined forms on the high table, the porcelain with wobbly contours, the totem-like piece of wood are in homage to the artist, sometimes considered the most brilliant printmaker ever in Japanese history.        
	However brilliant, the show deserved to be better displayed. The lighting is poor and the labels can hardly be seen. The catalogue with reproductions of all the works in the show is beautifully produced.       SOUMITRA DAS

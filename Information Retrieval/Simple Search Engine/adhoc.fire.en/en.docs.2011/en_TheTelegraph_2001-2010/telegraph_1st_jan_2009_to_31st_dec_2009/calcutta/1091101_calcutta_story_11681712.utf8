	The list of the most annoying words was mindblowing! (Scrap it, October 18). Another such irritating expression is dont o-r-r-y (said with a drawl), be happy. It does nothing to drive away worries but gives one murderous thoughts as well.             
	Shipra Chakraborty,
  CIT Road           
	xxx           
	lI would like to add a few to your list of annoying words: sweetie, dada/didi, anytime (in response to thank you), post-lunch/second half, no issues, chal (precursor to goodbye).           
	Srimati Roy           
	xxx  The words that bother me most are hebby, byapok, boss and arre yaar. Todays youth use these frequently. The original meanings of the words are distorted. To some extent, the quality of the language (either Bengali or English) deteriorates with the overuse of these irritating terms.

	Apropos Eco hurdles for hub, September 6, on the challenges faced by the proposed chemical hub at Nayachar, I would like to add that the mouth of any river has a unique biodiversity because of sweet water and silt. Any interference with such an ecosystem can have tremendous impact on the environment, affecting biodiversity and even changing the route of the river. Also, an industrial accident may pollute the water of the Ganga and lead to an ecological catastrophe.             
	Government officials clear projects despite obvious environmental dangers as they cant afford to antagonise their political bosses. They know they will never be penalised for making technical mistakes. If the Nayachar hub proves to be environmentally hazardous, the post-retirement benefits of the officials who gave it an environmental clearance should be stopped and criminal proceedings initiated against them.

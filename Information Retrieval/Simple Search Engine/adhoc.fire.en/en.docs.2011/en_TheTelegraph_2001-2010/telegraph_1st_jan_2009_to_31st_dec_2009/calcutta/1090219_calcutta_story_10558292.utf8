                      Delving into an ocean of music                    Pandit Mallikarjun Mansur (1910-1992) was one of the greatest exponents of the Jaipur-Atrauli gharana of Khayal singing. His musical career spanned over six decades. This genius from Dharwad (Karnataka) began his training under Pandit Nilkanth Bua of Miraj who belonged to the Gwalior gharana. However, the most important influences on his singing were his gurus, Manji Khan and Bhurji Khan, who were the sons of Ustad Alladiya Khan, one of the most significant figures of 20th century Hindustani classical music. Pandit Mallikarjun Mansur was well known for his command over a large number of rare (aprachalit) ragas such as Shuddh Nat, Asa Jogiya, Hem Nat, Lachchhasakh, Khat and Bahaduri Todi, as well as his constant, mercurial improvisations in both melody and metre without ever losing the emotional content of the song. There was always a special intensity to his singing, a special urgency and eagerness in his treatment of melody. Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, in collaboration with School of Cultural Texts and Records, Jadavpur University, presents a selection of the maestros audio and video recordings to depict a slice of the vast musical territory he reigned over. The programme will be conducted by Professor Amlan Dasgupta, assisted by Subhranil Sarkar.                  Event: Pandit Mallikarjun Mansur: A Life in Music  an audio-visual tribute to Pandit Mallikarjun Mansur When: Today at 6 pm Where: Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, Vivekananda Hall, Gol Park

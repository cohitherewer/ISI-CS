	The guard posted at the Salt Lake BF block house that has been cleaned out and the owner of the agency that employed him were arrested on Thursday night.        
	The thieves must have stolen furniture from the house over months. But the neighbours did not have a clue, said Avijit Sarkar, the owner of the two-storeyed house.        
	The Lucknow resident returned to the house on Thursday evening to find furniture and electrical, kitchen and bathroom fittings stolen.         
	Sainik Securities has been guarding the house since February. Its owner Kamal Dey and guard Kumaresh Har have been arrested.         
	We have got some clues and will conduct raids. The suspects include guards of the other agencies that used to guard the house earlier, said an investigator.        
	Another house in Salt Lake, AE 87, was burgled on Thursday night while the owner was away. Valuables worth over a lakh were stolen.

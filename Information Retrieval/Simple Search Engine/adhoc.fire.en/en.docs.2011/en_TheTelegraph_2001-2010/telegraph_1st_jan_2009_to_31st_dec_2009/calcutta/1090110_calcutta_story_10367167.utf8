The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Kerala comes to Bengal 
                                                                                                               Kerala comes to Bengal

	The backwaters could not be transported to Calcutta but the St Xaviers College ground reverberated with music and dance from Gods Own Country on January 3 at the Kerala Utsav, 2009.         
	Organised by the Kerala Catholic Social Service Centre, the evening kicked off with Shingari Melam, where a group of 15 artistes from Kerala used the chenda and ilathalam to create wonderful rhythm. Their music left the audience tapping their feet.         
	Other performances included Bharatnatyam, Mohiniattam and Oppana (performed by girls in traditional Muslim attire) dance recitals.        
	Most of the participants were students of Nritya Paadam, a school for South Indian classical dances in Calcutta. We practised for about a week. Performing in front of a large audience is very rewarding, said Class V student Drishya Purushothaman.         
	Several games were also organised to lure the kids. One also got to enjoy Malayali cuisine like kappa and fish curry, palappam and chicken curry, banana fry, etc.         
	Thankamani Kutty, the founder of Kalamandalam, was the chief guest.                     JHINUK MAZUMDAR

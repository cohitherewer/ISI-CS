The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Suicide seal on cop death
                                                                                                               Suicide seal on cop death
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The CID has come to the conclusion that Arindam Manna committed suicide driven by depression, sources said.        
	A statement announcing the death as suicide  and not murder, as claimed by the sub-inspectors family  will be issued a few days later as the sleuths are yet to go through the forensic report.        
	Manna, attached to the Dum Dum unit of the GRP, was found dead on a railway track near Mankundu station in Hooghly on February 11.        
	The sources said the two post-mortem reports and the statements of the woman Manna was supposed to get married to in April suggested that the 31-year-old had killed himself. The woman  Manna had spoken to her for more than 50 minutes over the phone shortly before his death  told the cops that he had sounded depressed and repeatedly told her that he was contemplating suicide.        
	Circumstantial evidence and the statements of a number of people suggest Manna had jumped in front of a train. We are trying to find out whether there was any abetment, said a CID officer.        
	The cops are also probing the alleged showdown between Arindam and his colleagues after he was removed from the plainclothes party that used to carry out raids. Sources in the GRP said the members of such teams, disbanded on Wednesday, were often on the payroll of criminals.        
	The sleuths have detected a disparity between Mannas assets and income. The police suspect that he went into depression after realising that a probe might be ordered against him.        
	Arindam, the sole bread-earner of the family, used to draw a salary of less than Rs 13,000. Within six years in service, he bought a three-cottah plot in Dasnagar, built a single-storey house and started constructing the first floor. He also bore the expenses of his sisters wedding, said an officer.

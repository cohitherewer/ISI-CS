                                                                                                               Cop custody for terror kingpin 
          A STAFF REPORTER                                             
	Mohammad Umer Madni, the alleged Lashkar-e-Toiba operative arrested in New Delhi recently, was produced in the additional chief metropolitan magistrates court on Wednesday and remanded in police custody till July 15.         
	Officers of Calcutta polices Special Task Force flew down the 52-year-old from New Delhi on Tuesday night in connection with a counterfeit currency racket.         
	He has been booked by the city police under sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 489B (using counterfeit notes) and 489C (possession of forged and counterfeit notes).        
	Madni is believed to have been responsible for recruiting and training youths from the four metros for Lashkars sleeper cells apart from looking into the terror outfits financial operations.         
	The man from Bihar allegedly knew the key operatives behind circulation of fake notes in India and had planned to spread counterfeit notes in Calcutta.        
	Madni knew Mahim Master, the 35-year-old man who was recently arrested at Burtolla with fake notes. He also knew Mustaq, the 30-year-old arrested with explosives in Murshidabad in May last year, said Bastab Baidya, the deputy commissioner of police (Special Task Force).         
	The police claimed Mustaq had met Madni, who had assumed the name Meheraj, in Nepal to collect a fake passport for a trip to Dubai, where he was supposed to undergo terror training.         
	Madni used over eight names while operating from his hideout in Nepal. None of those who came in touch with him knew his real identity, added Baidya.        
	A string of arrests over the past few months threw up a common name  Miraj, who seemed to be the Lashkar chief in the area. We later found that Madni was Miraj.        
	According to the police, about 18 months ago, Madni had travelled from Jharkhand to Birbhums Nalhati to meet a relative. It is not clear whether he had ever camped in the city.        
	Madni first underwent training at a Lashkar camp in Muzaffarabad in 1997. He has sent over 20 youths from different parts of India to terror camps. Madni went to Doha for further training and visited Dhaka several times from Nepal, said a senior officer of the Special Task Force.         
	The police ruled out any connection between Madni and the Maoists.

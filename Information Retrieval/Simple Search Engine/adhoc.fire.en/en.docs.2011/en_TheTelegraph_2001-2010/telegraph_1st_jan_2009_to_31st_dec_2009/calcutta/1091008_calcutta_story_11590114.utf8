                      Justice prosecuted                    Innocence is irrelevant  resources are the key.        An innocent person has a more difficult time building a defence against what is unknown. Moreover, in the overwhelming percentage of cases, defendants cannot afford to spend as much money and/or time on building a defence as the government does building its case against him/her. Two or three months is not even enough time for an attorney to become familiar with the facts, allegations and charges in serious cases, let alone build a defence. This is specially true when evidence is weak and suspicion of innocence is strong, for this is when law enforcement and prosecutors, desperate to win, fudge on evidence, making defence against false, exaggerated or manufactured evidence extremely difficult. The prosecution is much more prepared to convict a few months following arrest than the defence is to acquit. Prosecutors view every case as a battle to win; conviction is the goal and the only acceptable outcome of a trial. They believe their purpose is to convict, not to judge guilt or innocence; that, they preach, is the province of the court. In late 1995, media was rife with frequent reports of rapes and other indecencies on women in the state. This resulted in a workshop session through which Justice on Trial was conceptualised. Written and directed by Rohit Pombra, the courtroom drama revolves around the rape of an attractive, young, married woman. Laced with some hard-hitting dialogues, the script is taut and fast-paced, leaving the ending open, with the sentence for the accused left to the imagination and sensibilities of the audience.

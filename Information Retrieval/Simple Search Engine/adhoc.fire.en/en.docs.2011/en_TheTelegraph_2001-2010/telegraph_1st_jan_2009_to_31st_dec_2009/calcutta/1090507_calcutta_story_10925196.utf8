The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Schools hold out fee truce
                                                                                                               Schools hold out fee truce
  - Hike in phases with   guardians consent        MITA MUKHERJEE                                                
	Private schools that had objected to being asked to consult guardians before raising fees showed the first sign of softening their stance on Wednesday, with at least one rolling back a part of the proposed hike.        
	Welland Gouldsmith School decided to hike the monthly fees by Rs 250 instead of the proposed Rs 400 after two rounds of meetings with guardians. Several other schools are said to be planning staggered hikes at reasonable intervals and rates  as advised by the government  to placate the agitating guardians.                    
	We need to increase the fees by Rs 400 per month per student to meet our increased recurring expenses, including the implementation of a pay hike for our staff, said Gilian Rosemary Hart, the principal of Welland Gouldsmith School.        
	The Anglo-Indian school has traditionally resisted any kind of interference by guardians in its administrative policies. The intensity of the protests against the hike in fees, however, forced the institution to convene two rounds of meetings on Tuesday with guardians representatives.        
	 After detailed discussions and considering the difficulties that the guardians might face, the management has decided to raise the tuition fees by only Rs 250 per month, Hart announced a day later.         
	Almost every school has cited the recommendations of the Fifth Pay Commission for hiking fees. Some have said they cannot improve facilities for the students if the fees are not raised.        
	In a notice to the schools last week that was first made available to media, the director of school education requested them to be judicious and reasonable while raising fees and take a decision in consultation with the guardians.         
	It has been brought to our notice that quite a few non-government, DA-getting or unaided English-medium schools affiliated to ICSE and CBSE have either raised or are contemplating raising their respective school fees to disburse salaries to their staff on a par with government norms. Such action has caused widespread resentment among guardians, the official said.        
	The principals of most schools protested, insisting that the government had no right to foist the guardians forums on them. The same notice was then reissued directly to the schools on Tuesday, with the words in consultation with the guardians forums struck off.         
	We have removed the words in consultation with the guardians forums from the appeal because the schools have agreed to consider the demand of the guardians that the fee hikes be reasonable, a source in the education department said.        
	Nabarun Dey, the secretary of the Association of Heads of ISC Schools, said a phased fee hike and austerity measures seemed to be the best solutions to the crisis.        
	We have decided not to raise fees sharply, he promised.        
	Sujoy Biswas, the principal of Rammohan Mission High School, said he and his colleagues had decided to follow the same system. We are suspending development plans for some time. We will raise the fees by small amounts every year to make up the deficit.        
	Richard Gasper of the St Augustine group of schools said his institution would strike a balance between the teachers demand for higher pay and the guardians insistence on a reasonable fee hike.

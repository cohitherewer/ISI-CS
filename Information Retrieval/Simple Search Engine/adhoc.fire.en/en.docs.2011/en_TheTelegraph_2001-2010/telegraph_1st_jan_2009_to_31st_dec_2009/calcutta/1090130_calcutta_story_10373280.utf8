The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Profiles of 2-stroke peril
                                                                                                               Profiles of 2-stroke peril
                              The lungs of a cancer patient in Calcutta. The cause? Auto emission                            
	Being conscious of the dangers posed to the health of the younger generation, i.e. our children and grandchildren, the court had specified a time scheme within which pollution from autorickshaws was to be brought under control by the state government         
	 Calcutta High Court, January 9, 2009         
	On Friday, the court is expected to take stock of what the government has done since January 9 to phase out the two-stroke autos that release toxins in the air, poisoning our bodies with every breath we take. Nobody who lives in this city is safe as long as these killer three-wheelers ply on the streets, but some categories of people are more at risk. Metro profiles the high-risk groups on the eve of the courts review:                
	WHAT: Carbon monoxide        
	WHO: Infants, pregnant women and people with cardiovascular disease        
	HOW: Carbon monoxide is rapidly absorbed in the lungs; it mixes with blood and impairs the hearts oxygen-carrying capacity. Many infants are born with respiratory problems and exposure to carbon monoxide worsens their condition. Children living near streets where 20,000 or more vehicles ply every day are six times more likely than others to develop cancer. Women living near high-traffic areas are more likely to give premature birth.              
	WHAT: Particulate matter        
	WHO: Elderly people, children and those with breathing problems                
	HOW: Respirable particulate matter, especially those that are 2.5 microns in size or smaller, get embedded in the lungs and restrict supply of oxygen. This triggers ischaemia in adults, a condition that affects cardiac rhythm and can lead to heart attacks. In children, particulate matter causes respiratory tract infections, wheezing and asthma.                
	WHAT: Nitrogen dioxide        
	WHO: Children and people with asthma, bronchitis and other such diseases        
	HOW: Nitrogen dioxide gets absorbed into the mucous membrane of the respiratory tract, causing bronchitis and pneumonia and increases susceptibility to respiratory infections. It also impairs the immune system and lung growth in children. Even short-term exposure can aggravate respiratory and cardiovascular diseases in people who already suffer from these.              
	WHAT: Hydrocarbons        
	WHO: People prone to cancers because of genetic reasons or high-risk activities like smoking        
	HOW: Hydrocarbons are a highly toxic group of organic compounds. They permeate the air as free vapours, causing several types of cancers. Hydrocarbons travel over long distances.                
	WHAT: Lead        
	WHO: Infants and children less than five years old        
	HOW: Lead affects the central nervous system in children and can also impair hormonal functions. Kids exposed to lead poisoning are deficient in vitamin D and lag behind their peers in neurological development, which ultimately affects their intelligence.

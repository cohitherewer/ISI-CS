The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Chip on sleepy guards shoulders
                                                                                                               Chip on sleepy guards shoulders
  - Police adopt technology to keep Salt Lake nightwatchmen on their toes          A STAFF REPORTER                                                  
	Salt Lake guards who doze off on duty instead of patrolling the locality are losing sleep over a microchip sensor designed to track their movements through the night.        
	The experiment of using technology to keep nightwatchmen awake in Salt Lake, where burglaries are common, began in AE block on Sunday.        
	Roving guards employed by the block committee have been given microchip-fitted devices that will record where they were at what time of night whenever these come in contact with paired sensor points along the designated route. Its almost like an attendance or time recorder in an office. One look at the readings and you know whether the guards did the rounds properly or not the night before, Supratim Sarkar, the superintendent of North 24-Parganas police, said.        
	The police have installed sensor points in front of 23 houses in AE block, Salt Lakes largest and also the one where the strike rate of burglars is the highest. Two footbridges connect AE block with VIP Road, making it more vulnerable to burglaries than other parts of Salt Lake. We needed something like this, Sanjay Kar Chowdhury, the secretary of AE blocks Samaj Kalyan Sangha, said.        
	Deputy inspector-general (presidency) Soumen Mitra described Project Nightwatchman as a first for Bengal police and a practical solution to the problem of guards sleeping on the job. Apart from two teams of three private guards each, two cops will do the rounds of the block on bicycles.                                
	Like the guards employed by the block committee, the duo have to record their patrolling timings in part II of the block with a microchip device.         
	The system isnt foolproof yet because it cannot tell whether only one guard patrolled a designated area instead of three on a given night. The problem might remain even after each guard is given a separate device because one of them could carry his colleagues devices and do the needful.         
	We will deal with the teething problems as we go along, Sarkar said.        
	The three microchip devices and the 23 sensor points cost Rs 60,000 but the company that markets the technology has not charged a rupee for the pilot project. If the surveillance strategy succeeds, we will consider extending it to other parts of Salt Lake. Money shouldnt be a problem if each block committee contributes its share, the SP said.

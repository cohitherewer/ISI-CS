The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | SIM haul prompts jail security revamp
                                                                                                               SIM haul prompts jail security revamp
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The jail department is taking steps to make prisons more secure following the recovery of cellphones, SIM cards and other banned items from Alipore Central jail last week.        
	We have adopted a number of measures to curb illegal activities and strengthen security inside jails. Jail superintendents have been instructed to keep a close watch on warders entering the premises. Employees will be frisked before they are allowed in, state jail minister Biswanath Chowdhury told Metro.        
	Warders have been barred from carrying cellphones inside jails. Several mobile phones have been recovered from cells inside Presidency and Alipore jails over the past few months, exposing the nexus between jail employees and criminals. Alipore Central jail superintendent Kumaresh Ray was recently held accountable for the presence of cellphones on the premises and slapped with a showcause.        
	Lists of daily strictures have been given to the jail superintendents. Officials will conduct surprise raids to check whether the proposed guidelines are being followed. We have to curb any illegal activities going on inside jails, the minister added.        
	Inspector-general (prisons) will oversee the arrangements.        
	A senior official in the department said that a section of warders have been posted at Alipore Central and Presidency jails for several years, in violation of rules. These officials will be transferred to district jails.         
	Senior officers of Calcutta police have been asked to be vigilant about criminals operating from inside jails.         
	Corrupt jail officials provide criminals access to cellphones and other avenues of communication in exchange of money. The racket is deep- rooted, said a senior police officer.        
	An official in Alipore central jail said jammers installed last year were lying defunct. The purpose behind installing jammers has been defeated. We have written to the minister but nothing has been done so far, said an official.         
	The minister said more jammers would be installed in jails. We will hold talks with cellphone service providers to make the existing jammers operational.

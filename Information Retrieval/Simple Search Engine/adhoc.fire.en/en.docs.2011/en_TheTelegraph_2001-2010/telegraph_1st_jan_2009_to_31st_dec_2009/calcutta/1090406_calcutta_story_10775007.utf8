The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Slump boost for domestic tourism
                                                                                                               Slump boost for domestic tourism

	The global downturn and withdrawal of international flights from the city is set to boost domestic tourism this summer.        
	Calcutta has witnessed a six per cent drop in the number of people flying out in the past fiscal. But the situation is likely to improve this summer as airlines are offering special fares and increasing frequencies to some popular destinations, said an Airports Authority of India official.        
	Places like Goa, Kashmir and Darjeeling are in more demand than the popular stops in Europe, the US and Southeast Asia. The rush is likely to increase in the second quarter of April, said Anil Punjabi, the chairman (east) of the Travel Agents Federation of India.        
	Last year, 60 per cent of the bookings through tour operators were for international packages. Till date this year, 65 per cent of the bookings are for domestic destinations, he said.        
	Travel industry sources said the scope for opting for cheaper fares through advance booking is luring tourists from international to domestic sectors.        
	Airlines are offering return fares of Rs 6,000-6,500 in sectors like Delhi and Mumbai, attracting a lot of passengers, said Punjabi.        
	International travel from Calcutta received a jolt in the last week of March when British Airways and Gulf Air withdrew from the city. Domestic operators, on the other hand, have increased their frequencies for the summer. Low- cost carrier IndiGo will start flights to Goa on April 29. The airline had introduced its Goa flight after Puja in 2007 but withdrew it in April next year.        
	Earlier, the flight stopped over in Hyderabad. But this time, it will go via Mumbai. This flight will be more viable, an IndiGo official said. The introduction of the third flight to Goa  the other two being operated by Kingfisher (through Mumbai) and SpiceJet (through Jaipur and Ahmedabad)  tour operators are expecting good bookings to the beach resort.        
	On March 29, IndiGo had launched flights to Ahmedabad and Bangalore from the city. SpiceJet has added a new route from Calcutta to Pune through Delhi.        
	In the summer schedule, Kingfisher has added sectors such as Patna-Ranchi-Mumbai, and Ahmedabad. The airline will also fly to Dibrugarh and Jorhat for three days a week each through Guwahati. Air India has increased its frequency on the Calcutta-Bagdogra route from three to four days a week.        
	Airline operators, however, said international travel would pick up later this month.

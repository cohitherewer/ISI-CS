	The owner of a small bookshop in Behala is desperately trying to arrange funds to continue the treatment of his cancer-afflicted son. Three-year-old Aarav is admitted to Apollo Speciality Hospital in Chennai with acute bilineage leukaemia, a rare blood cancer.         
	We have spent Rs 15 lakh on chemotherapy, bone marrow transplant and supportive treatment. But he has post-operative complications, said Aaravs father Dipankar Sil, who earns Rs 5,000 per month.        
	Aarav received the bone marrow from his 18-month-old sister.         
	Sil has exhausted his savings and is dependent on donations from relatives and friends. The money donated by some business houses and organisations for Aaravs treatment has run out.         
	The infrastructure in state-run hospitals is inadequate for treating rare cancer cases and private healthcare is hugely expensive, said Subir Ganguly, the head of oncology at NRS hospital.

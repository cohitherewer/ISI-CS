The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Twin vats turn death trap for students
                                                                            Tuesday , November 10 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Twin vats turn death trap for students
          ONTHESPOT - BT ROAD                                    (Top) Students of St Ninians High School, after getting off a bus near the vat on BT Road; (left) the vat on the opposite flank. Pictures by Anindya Shankar Ray                                  
	Two garbage vats, placed on either side of BT Road near Chiria More, has put the lives of several school-goers and commuters in danger.         
	A bright yellow container placed a few steps from St Ninians High School for Girls at 30 BT Road is a major cause for concern for the school authorities and guardians.         
	The footpath leading up to the school is blocked with leftovers of drainage construction and the vat, placed in front of the litter, forces commuters to walk on the main road.         
	We have informed the councillor and local police station of the problem on several occasions but no action has been taken. The vat is placed in such a manner that accidents can happen any moment. Our students will be safe only if it is shifted elsewhere. We have received several complaints from guardians too, said Maya Gupta, teacher-in-charge of the state-aided missionary school.         
	As there is no designated bus stand after Chira More, most buses drop the school-goers in front of the vat. At times when the buses screech to a halt in front of the vat, there is very little space between the vehicles and the vat. The speeding buses almost graze past us, said Manas Bhattacharya, a staff member of St Ninians High School. We have to wriggle through bicycles, motorcycles and buses, said Pallabi Satra, a student of the school who comes from Paikpara.        
	Though the civic authorities admit being aware of the problem, they cite the Calcutta Environment Improvement Projects (CEIP) drainage and sewerage work for not taking any steps. We cant remove the vat as the CEIP work is on and the stretch is blocked with pipes and rubbish, said Kanailal Ganguly, the CPM councillor of Calcutta Municipal Corporations ward 1.         
	The CEIP, on its part, wants to wash its hands of the matter. Work on that stretch started in March 2008 and was finished in March 2009. We will remove the rubbish but we cant say when, said a CEIP official, who couldnt explain why the footpath had not been cleared even seven months after the drainage work was completed.         
	Another vat on the opposite footpath causes problems for commuters coming from Dunlop. This vat is as dirty as the other one, and we have no option but to walk on the road, said Chandrima Chatterjee, a resident of Bonhooghly. The logic behind placing two vats close to each other foxes most commuters. What sense does it make? Do the civic authorities have any idea of the trouble we face while driving? The spillover garbage sticks to the wheels and I always fear skidding on the road, said Dunlop resident Susmit Mitra, who rides his motorcycle to his office in central Calcutta.         
	The traffic cops fear major mishaps because of the vats. We are unable to assign a bus bay because the two vats have narrowed down the roadspace for a distance of 50m from Chiria More, said an officer of Shyambazar Traffic Guard.

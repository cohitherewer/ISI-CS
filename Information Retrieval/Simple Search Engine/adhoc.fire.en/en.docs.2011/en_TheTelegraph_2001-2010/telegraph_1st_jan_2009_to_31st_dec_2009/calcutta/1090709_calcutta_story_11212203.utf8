The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Office, temple on water body
                                                                                                               Office, temple on water body

	A 2.15-bigha water body in Tiljala is being filled up by various groups with the authorities turning a blind eye.         
	According to residents, one-fifth of the pond at 214 Picnic Garden Road has been reclaimed over the past few years, allegedly with the support of local CPM leaders.        
	An organisation called Bustee Federation has set up office on the south-east corner of the water body. The room, which served as the election office of the CPMs Rabin Deb before the Lok Sabha polls, sports several party flags. A temple has been erected by a local club in the north-east corner.        
	The water body is a stones throw from mayoral council member (environment) Sushil Kumar Sharmas residence in Kustia government housing estate.        
	The factory on the western bank of the pond belches waste into the water. Residents of the illegal buildings that have sprung up around the water body also dump waste into it, said a resident.        
	Local CPM councillor Dipu Das claimed the Bustee Federation office was constructed long before she became councillor.        
	I do not know who the owner of the pond is. We started a campaign to stop the landfill but as the owner did not come forward, no action could be taken, she added.        
	Shakti Shankar, the owner, alleged: The CPM has grabbed a part of my pond. Some leaders threatened to grab the entire pond if I protested. I rented out the pond for pisciculture.         
	The pond is yet to be included in the list of ponds in the city. We will do so soon. I am issuing an inspection order and after getting the report, the pond will be restored, said Sharma.

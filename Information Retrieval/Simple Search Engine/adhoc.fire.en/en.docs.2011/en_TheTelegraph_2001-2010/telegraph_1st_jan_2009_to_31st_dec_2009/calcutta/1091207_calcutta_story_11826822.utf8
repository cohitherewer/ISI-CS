  - A workshop-exhibition at CIMA is all about time travel and parallel interpretations          ARKA DAS                          Mayank Kumar Shyam, who hails from a tribal belt in Bhopal, reinterprets a work by artist Subodh Gupta. Picture by Aranya Sen                                        
	Seventeen contemporary artists in a workshop-exhibition over a month are ready to showcase their interpretations of art ranging from modern times to a couple of centuries back.        
	Starting Wednesday, In Search Of A Context at CIMA Gallery promises to be an exhilarating journey through time and place, offering recontextualised works in media ranging from paintings to sculpture to drawings, collages and film and video.        
	Given the roster of artists, more often than not, such interpretations and processes would be achieved without the baggage of conditioned perceptions, breaking away from pre-conceived responses to cull the essence of the work.        
	The idea is not just interpretation, but discovering the perspective of the individual artists construal on a chosen work by another. It would be very interesting to get a glimpse of the observations inspired by the original work. And there is quite a range, be it in terms of the time period, style, media or the new context, said Pratiti Sarkar of CIMA. In a way, this is as much time travel as parallel interpretations.        
	Interesting would be an understatement. If at one end theres Jogen Chowdhury reinterpreting a classic J. Swaminathan work, at another theres the 22-year-old tribal artist Mayank Kumar Shyam, from a village near Bhopal, creating his dual mixed-media paintings vis--vis a post-2000 Subodh Gupta work, typically featuring everyday objects.        
	This particular work, part of the seminal kitchen utensils series by Gupta whose celebrity status Mayank is not really aware of  is transmorphed on the youngsters sketches at the ongoing workshop.        
	The overtly urban Gupta painting is realigned to reflect Mayanks roots. Animated with birds, rats, spiders, centipedes and snakes, the reinterpretation is infused with a philosophy bordering on the spiritual.         
	Larger storage bartans take the shape of a rustic granary, a revered object of puja.                                
	Each animal is equated with specific kitchen objects and ingrained with a trait that reflects the utility of the same: the spoon, with its functional character of gathering the food on a plate, shapes itself into a rat with its habit of collecting scraps; the bird is symbolic of taking one mouthful at a time; the all-encompassing spider web is a representation of a thaali with different preparations.        
	Rashmi Bagchi Sarkar wasnt familiar with Mumbai-based artist Meera Devidayals slumscapes. Intense with detail, Devidayals mixed-media works on which Rashmi is working employ the corrugated, rust-strewn aluminium sheets that typify a Mumbai chawl.                   Artist Rashmi Bagchi Sarkar works around an original mixed-media work by Mumbai-based artist Meera Devidayal. Picture by Aranya Sen      
	The details are what Rashmi elaborates on in one of her reinterpretations. She has created a tiny room that opens up to the Devidayal work, sketching and painting directly on the gallery wall and driving nails and sieves to elucidate the physical space.        
	A parallel is in Kingshuk Sarkars representation of the famous womans head by Ravinder Reddy. Placed against a vivid crimson background, Kingshuk has not veered away from the voluptuousness of Reddys original sculpture.         
	But his individual representation aligns itself more to a Durga puja. Thus, theres an ekchala frame and handmade dolls and various sketches and knick-knacks, something he says would offer children a chance to enjoy the work as well.        
	The dynamic Sumitro Basak takes a U-turn, both in the choice of original work and understanding. Working with a 200-year-old mother-and-child sculpture from Kerala, Sumitro has created a flat, two-dimensional manicured hedge fronting European households as a background  in his typical, serrated, papercut-like brushwork  with plans to place a doll-child in a snazzy perambulator, in direct contrast to the traditional three-dimensional figure he has opted to recontextualise.        
	While interpretations like these form one aspect of the show, there are also unique collaborative endeavours among contemporaries, like Satyajit Roy and Shreyasi Chatterjee  Roy, quirky with his ideas, plans to create a disc floor around Shreyasis take on the drama of the everyday clothesline, a work titled Up In The Air. Then theres Shreyasis take on one of Sumitros translucent, fluid human figures, where she creates a negative colour field to emphasise the works emotive agony.        
	Reprinted on the catalogue front, Swarna Chitrakars luminescent Kalighat pata works frame a seminal Arpita Singh painting. Swarnas rendition through her miniature works depicts a day in the life of a woman.        
	The philosophy, in the works of artists who have never met each other, meets at a twain, at a reality that runs deeper than the physical.        
	Historic is a much-maligned term. The CIMA show, from December 9 to January 9, may offer us a chance to use it in the correct context.

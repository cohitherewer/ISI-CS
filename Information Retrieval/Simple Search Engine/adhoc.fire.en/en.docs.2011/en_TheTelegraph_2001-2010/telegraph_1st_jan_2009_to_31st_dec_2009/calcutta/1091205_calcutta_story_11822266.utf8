The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Classes shut for CPM lectures   CPM meet robs college of a day
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Classes shut for CPM lectures     - North Calcutta campus loses a day in order to host party meet          A STAFF REPORTER                          BKC shut for the day. (Soumen Bhattacharjee)                                        
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee may have deviated from his party line in a bid to unshackle a citadel of education, but nothing seems to have changed in his rank and file.        
	In what can be seen as a blatant violation of Bhattacharjees vision  that is powering Presidency College to unitary university status  his partymen have been instrumental in the suspension of academic activities at Brahmananda Keshab Chandra (BKC) college for the sake of a CPM local committee meeting hosted by its student wing.        
	They could have found any other venue for the meeting. What was the point of closing down the college for a party meeting? said a second-year student, who reached the campus, near the Dunlop crossing, to attend class. More students trickled in and soon there was a huddle near the ground-floor notice board, where the class-suspension announcement  bearing principal Ajoy Deb Guptas signature  had been put up.        
	All classes will remain suspended today from 11.15am due to a conference of the SFI, read the notice.        
	How could the principal allow a party meeting by suspending classes? wondered a senior teacher of the college.        
	Atish Dasgupta, the acting chairman of the governing body of the college and brother of state finance minister Asim Dasgupta, denounced the decision to suspend classes. Suspension of academic activities for political programmes is unfair. No political party should be allowed to hold programmes that disrupt classes, said Dasgupta, who resigned from the colleges board last week.        
	SFI leaders in the Bonhooghly college, a traditional Left stronghold, stonewalled questions. Kaustav Chatterjee, the student wings state secretary, said he was not aware of any SFI programme at BKC. I will have to enquire about this. I am not aware of all the programmes organised at local levels, he protested. A member of the CPMs Baranagar local committee, however, said the college unit of the SFI had organised a party programme to pay homage to the martyrs of the food movement.                          
	More than 600 students of the college lost a full working day because of the suspension of classes. Such an act is not only illegal but anti-student, said a senior teacher.        
	A source in college said members of the ruling union did not even submit a formal request to use it as a venue for the CPM event. They just sought verbal permission and as the principal is a party appointee, he promptly gave the go-ahead.        
	The decision to suspend classes was the principals. There are different groups of students in our college. Some students might not have approved of the SFI meeting. So I thought it sensible to keep classes suspended for the whole day, said Deb Gupta.        
	Protesting the sudden closure of the college, some students met the principal and submitted a memorandum.        
	With the Trinamul Congress Chhatra Parishad making inroads on various campuses where the SFI has reigned supreme, the party meeting at BKC is being seen as a show of strength.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bus lobby in age-old battle
                                                                                                               Bus lobby in age-old battle
          JAYANTA BASU                              
	The bus operators in Delhi have done it, failed and been forced to toe the green line. Now, the bus operators in Calcutta are planning to try their luck in the Supreme Court in a last-ditch attempt to buy time for old vehicles.        
	We are moving the Supreme Court against the Calcutta High Court order for the phase-out of 15-year-old vehicles from August 1. The national auto fuel policy states that emission quality, rather than age, should be the criterion to bar a vehicle, said Swarnakamal Saha of the Bengal Bus Syndicate, soon after his team left for Delhi on Monday.        
	Environment activist Subhash Dutta said the move by the bus lobby was doomed as the apex court cannot possibly swallow its own order.        
	The order in question is the one passed in 1998, when the Supreme Court had directed that all commercial vehicles above 15 years be phased out within specific deadlines and only CNG-driven ones be allowed to ply in Delhi.        
	The Supreme Court in 2001 had evoked Article 21  right to life and proper public health  and reiterated the ban on old vehicles.        
	In 2002, the diesel bus operators in Delhi  with government support  had referred to the national auto fuel policy prepared by the Mashelkar committee and argued that old buses should not be phased out on the basis of fuel use or age; tailpipe emission should be the sole criterion.        
	Harish Salve, amicus curae in the case, had trashed the committees tailpipe emission argument and the apex court had rejected the petition of the Delhi bus operators.        
	Justice B.N. Kirpal, who was heading the bench, observed that the auto fuel policy must focus on measures to  anticipate, prevent and attack vehicular pollution, and refused to allow old vehicles to run on the basis of acceptable tailpipe emission.        
	So, age and not emission was  and is  the bar.        
	The auto fuel policy, taking the tailpipe emission route, can at best be treated as a roadmap for emission standards, whereas the Supreme Court order of 1998 is the law of the land.        
	Anumita Roy Choudhury, air pollution expert from the Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment, said that the argument of the Calcutta bus operators can also be demolished on the basis of latest scientific findings and the poor auto emission testing standards in the country.        
	Data from the Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI), generated after the auto fuel policy notification, proves that emission from old vehicles are several times higher than new vehicles, said Roy Choudhury. The study found vehicles more than 10 years old emitting seven times more fumes than new vehicles. That figure will be far worse for much older buses in Calcutta.

Melody will find its expression with a tinge of nostalgia with the rendition of numbers whose popularity is evergreen. The performers have teamed up to harmonise and create a unique ambience for the audience. With each song and beat, they will be invited to join in and go along on this musical trip down memory lane. Sumita Bhattacharya, Prerna Bhattacharya and Prerna Sanyal will lend their voices to numbers that are eternal. Errol Vanjour will sing and be on the keyboards too. Timir Das at the octopad does his best to add to the zing of the event while Shubhankar Ghosh gives a magical touch to the guitar. Aishwarya Nag, a young violinist, will play tunes to add to the charm of the performance. A sing-along session and an evening of sheer harmony, it promises to provide the right ingredients that help create and cherish memories, and where the audience will feel an irresistible urge to hum and tap with those on stage.

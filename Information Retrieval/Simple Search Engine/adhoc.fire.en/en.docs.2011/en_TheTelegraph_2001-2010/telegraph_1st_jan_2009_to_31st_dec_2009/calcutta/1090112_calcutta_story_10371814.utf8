                      Musical homage to Swamiji                     Traditionally, music has been defined as a way to attain the four aims or purushrthas of life. Music merely as a diversion is a modern phenomenon whereas in the ancient world, it was always connected with a philosophical or ethical choice. A major function of music was to create absorption or tanmayata, which is emotionally very satisfying, and it does so more efficiently than any other art. It also provides a strong emotional expression. The philosophy of Indian music was part of the analysis of sound or nada, which included in its ambit, along with music and dance, grammar, language and meaning. All the systems of philosophy, whether Vedic, gamic or Tantric, have accepted the concept of nada as struck (hata) and unstruck (anhata), and have held that while anhata is for liberation and is not pleasing, the hata is pleasing and leads to anhata. The utility of hata or music proper is thus established for aesthetic pleasure (rajana), as well as for spiritual quest. Thus, Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa went into a deep trance on hearing the young Vivekanandas soulful singing. Swamiji later realised and commented the key note running through the music is I am He, I am He (so aham). This evening, Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture offers homage to Swamiji with a programme of music on the auspicious occasion of his 146th birth anniversary.                  lEvent: Homage through classical music to Swami Vivekananda to mark his 146th birth anniversary lWhen: Today at 9 am, 2 pm amp; 6 pm lWhere: Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, Gol Park

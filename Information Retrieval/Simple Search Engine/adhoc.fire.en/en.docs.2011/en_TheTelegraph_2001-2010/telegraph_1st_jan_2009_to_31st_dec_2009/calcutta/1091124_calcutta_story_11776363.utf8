	The chair of the chief justice of Calcutta High Court, which was missing the legend of the national emblem, has been inscribed with Satyameva Jayate. The anomaly came to light on November 20 when acting Chief Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya was hearing a PIL seeking the courts direction on the proper display of the national emblem.         
	The Constitution says the full emblem should be placed on the chairs of chief justices of high courts, the lawyer who moved the petition said.        
	Justice Bhattacharya had asked the registrar-general of the court to ensure the legend was inscribed onto the chair. He sat on a judges chair on Friday.        
	On Saturday (a court holiday), we inscribed the words Satyameva Jayate on the chief justices chair, a senior court officer said.         
	On Monday, the acting chief justice enquired whether Satyameva Jayate had been inscribed onto the chair and then sat on it, said a court official.

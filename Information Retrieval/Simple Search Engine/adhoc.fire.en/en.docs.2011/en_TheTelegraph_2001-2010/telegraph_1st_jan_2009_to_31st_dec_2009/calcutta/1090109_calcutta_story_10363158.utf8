The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Husband amp; girlfriend arrested
                                                                                                               Husband amp; girlfriend arrested
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The husband of Lopamudra Mitra, who ended her life by setting herself ablaze, and his girlfriend were arrested on Thursday on the charge of driving the 28-year-old to suicide.        
	Debashish Mitra and Sumona Pal had provoked Lopamudra to commit suicide, said Ashok Roy, the sub-divisional police officer of Belghoria.        
	Lopamudra (Metro referred to her as Gopa Mitra earlier to protect her identity) told the cops that her husband stood in front of her when she set herself on fire on Monday but did not try to save her.         
	Debashishs attitude hurt her and she refused to cooperate with the doctors, said a family member.        
	Lopamudras family came to know about Debashishs extramarital affair a year after her marriage in 2004. The couple quarrelled frequently over the affair. On Monday, Lopamudra told her husband that she would kill herself if he did not end the affair, said an officer. The homemaker left behind a three-year-old daughter.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pipe horrors
                                                                                                               Caleidoscope      Pipe horrors
										                        A protruding pipe along the Lenin Sarani pavement. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)				                                 
	Now the Calcutta Municipal Corporation has taken upon itself the task of laying new sewerage pipes that are being laid with apparently minimum intervention. But one does not need magnifying glasses to detect the pipes as they protrude along the pavement on both sides of Esplanade East extending down Lenin Sarani. Lying like giant anacondas whose dimensions would beat the imagination of any horror film director, the pipes make it impossible for pedestrians to cross the road and step on to the pavement.        
	The pipes are too thick, and one has to hop on top of them to gain access to the pavement. This would be an impossible feat for old people and children. This impediment apart, the pipes would act as dykes that, during rains, would obstruct rainwater from flowing away. And one can only imagine how the flooding situation in the Dharamtala area would go from bad to worse once it starts raining, thanks to these pipes. Foreign technology is fine, but we must remember we still live in a tropical country.

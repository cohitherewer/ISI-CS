          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT IN DELHI                              
	The Supreme Court has stayed a Calcutta High Court order directing the Howrah civic body to evict 400-odd low caste families from a waste dump in Belgachhia.         
	A petition by the residents had claimed that they were being discriminated against because of their social status and their fundamental rights were being violated. A bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan on December 16 stayed the high court order passed on December 5 last year.        
	The high court, acting on a petition by Howrah Ganatantrik Nagarik Samity, had passed the order after the Howrah municipality claimed that the families had illegally settled on the land.        
	Most of the settlers were scavengers or sweepers employed by the municipality, claimed a petitioner.

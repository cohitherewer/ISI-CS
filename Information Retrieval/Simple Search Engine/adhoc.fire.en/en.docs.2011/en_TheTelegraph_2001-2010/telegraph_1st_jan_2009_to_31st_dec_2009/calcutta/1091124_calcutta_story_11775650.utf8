	A pool car carrying 12 students of South Point School and two guardians smashed through the boundary wall of Salt Lake stadium on Monday, hours before the government decided to go slow on the crackdown against such vehicles.         
	None of the 15 in the Tata Sumo sustained serious injuries in the mishap on the EM Bypass around 11.40am.         
	The boys and girls, between 6 and 9 years old, told police that 35-year-old Sushanta Bar was talking on his cellphone while driving at high speed. He lost control while trying to steer the car past a crater, boarded the footpath and smashed through the wall. The Sumo came to a stop inside the stadium compound.        
	Alerted by pedestrians, some of the guardians rushed to the spot. Police accompanied the rest of the children to the school. Bar was arrested and the car seized.         
	The vehicles tyres had no grip. We are checking whether the tyres were retreaded, said an officer of Bidhannagar South police station. The car was overcrowded, added the officer.        
	Representatives of the pool car associations said the owner of the Sumo was not a member of any of the organisations.         
	At Writers, transport minister Ranjit Kundu expressed concern over the safety of pool cars and said the children survived the mishap by the grace of god but allowed operators more time to adhere to the norms.

										      FLASHBACK                                One of the waterbodies at Mahamayatala and (above) a temple near it. Pictures by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya				                           
	Mudar Patherya, a communications consultant deeply interested in the conservation of heritage, has stumbled upon a patch of green and two waterbodies at Mahamayatala in South 24- Parganas, 12 km from Baruipur. He had gone there early one morning last month to take photographs of two little Odissi dancers, and was overwhelmed by the greenery that has survived the march of housing complexes over what used to be farmland and orchards, often with tanks attached as a bonus.         
	The spot is locally known as Tetul Tala, off Garia Main Road, and the amazing thing about it is that it is right behind those endless rows of new concrete boxes that have come up on both sides of the road, as in many other roads.         
	To add to its picturesque beauty are two ruined Shiva temples where the lingams are still worshipped. The flowers around the two lingams are still fresh. The spots romantic appeal is enhanced by the surviving fragment of an arched enclosure.        
	It is a spot where the city and the village converge, and although walled on one side by highrises, nature is still unspoilt here. The two temples are not of hoary antiquity but are old enough. The bricks are not of the wafer-thin variety found in older structures.         
	Built in the do chala style, the two temples have fanlights spanning the small door, without glass, of course. These fanlights are a common enough feature in certain old structures  the Tipu Sultan mosque in Dharamtala has them, and so does its replica in Tollygunge.        
	On both sides of the doors are colonnades with bands at regular intervals running along their entire length. In the middle of the fanlight are what an Australian artist, who accompanied me, called a rosette, but was actually a familiar motif, possibly of terracotta. But this ornament, like the two temples, had been repaired with cement, at some point of time.        
	The added attraction is a jheel, a five minutes walk from the temple. It is an artificial waterbody, a middle-aged resident said.         
	Patherya had got in touch with G.M. Kapur of Intach to get the spot cleaned by schoolchildren without sanitising it. Patherya and Kapur want to involve the community  local people  to keep it tidy and free of eyesores such as plastic bottles and pouches, which had at one time threatened to swallow even as remote a spot as Leh. Kapur also plans to light up the temple unostentatiously (but is that really necessary?) as part of plan to conserve this slice of nature in the burgeoning city. Nature, particularly its last redoubts like what was once known as Kayaler Bagan in Narendraput, deserve to be conserved.         
	While no doubt the plan is well intentioned, it would not be unfair to ask why this green patch in the southern suburb and not an equally beautiful one on the northern outskirts?         
	And if the presence of the old temple has enhanced the saleability of this spot, the spot deep north, in Khardah, to be exact, also has temples, and of greater antiquity and beauty. And to top it all, it is close to the banks of the Hooghly nestled amid nature.        
	As in all questions of conservation, the pros and cons must be weighed before decisions  even minor ones  are made. Unfortunately, when it comes to Calcuttas built heritage, arbitrary and unilateral decisions are taken even when public money is spent. We increasingly look to the West to decide on the clothes we wear, music we listen to, books we read, and the food we eat, though not necessarily in that order. These are the fruits of globalisation we enjoy. But when it comes to public dealings, rather than opting for more transparency, people in power still hold things close to their chest. That is how they perpetuate their hold on power.       SOUMITRA DAS

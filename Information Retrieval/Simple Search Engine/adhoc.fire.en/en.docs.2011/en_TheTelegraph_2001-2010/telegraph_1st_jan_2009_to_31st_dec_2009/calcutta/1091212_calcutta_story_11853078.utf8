The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Gandhis gift to Raj Bhavan
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Gandhis gift to Raj Bhavan
          KINSUK BASU                          Gopalkrishna Gandhi at a recent book release event in Raj Bhavan                                  
	Pictures capturing some rare moments from Mahatma Gandhis life, more than 100 books and several mementoes  Gopalkrishna Gandhi has gifted a large chunk of his collection to Raj Bhavan before he bids adieu to the state as governor on December 14.        
	The photographs  Raj Bhavan insiders said Gandhi had collected them from various sources  are attached with a note from the governor urging the staff to preserve them properly.        
	Some of the photographs are very rare. For instance, the ones in which the Mahatma was with Suhrawardi in Beleghata and with Sarojini and Padmaja Naidu in Sodepur. There is also one photograph capturing the Mahatmas visit to Subhas Chandra Boses house on Elgin Road. All these will remain precious possessions for us, said an official of the Raj Bhavan library.        
	His collection of books which he has handed over to us is also quite enviable and varied, including titles on literature, cricket and even birds. Each one has his signature inside and carries a note saying the copy is meant for the library, the official said. The volumes will be kept under the title  Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhis collection.        
	Some of the titles in the governors collection are The Oxford India Tagore, Bengal Partition Stories, Jean-Paul Sartres The Aftermath of War, Donald Kroodsmas The Singing Life of Birds and The Illustrated History of Indian Cricket.        
	There is also a copy of Dara Shukoh, a play written by Gandhi himself.        
	While the books and paintings will be kept in the library, the 100-odd mementoes will be preserved in a room near the governors living room. The mementoes include statues and paintings, said an official at Raj Bhavan.        
	Repeated attempts to contact Gandhi on Friday failed. Sources said even most Raj Bhavan staffers were unaware of the gift when they met Gandhi on Friday evening at a farewell get-together.

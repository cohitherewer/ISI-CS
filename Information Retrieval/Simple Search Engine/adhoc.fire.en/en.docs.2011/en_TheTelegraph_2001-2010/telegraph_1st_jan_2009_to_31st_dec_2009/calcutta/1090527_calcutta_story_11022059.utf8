The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Aila forces ban on metal billboards
                                                                                                               Aila forces ban on metal billboards
  - Bigger hoardings suffer more damage          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                          A damaged billboard off EM Bypass, near Science City. Picture by Amit Datta                                        
	Cyclone Aila has forced the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) to draw up new safety norms for billboards, which include a ban on sheet metal hoardings.         
	Over 1,000 billboards were destroyed by the wind and found hanging precariously from buildings and gantries across the city.        
	The sheet metal roofs of several bus shelters were also blown off.         
	Till Mondays storm, the civic body was only concerned with the stability of structures on which billboards were fitted.         
	For rooftop billboards, civic officials checked whether the building was strong enough to bear the extra weight. In case of gantries, the officials assessed whether they could withstand strong wind.         
	Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay met officials of the advertisement department in the civic headquarters on Tuesday evening for drafting new safety norms for billboards and bus shelters.         
	Billboards where galvanised insulated (GI) sheets were used sustained the most damage on Monday. In some places, torn pieces of GI sheets were seen flying like kites. Passers-by would have been killed if these flying sheets had hit them. The wind speed of Mondays storm has offered us a benchmark to work out a policy for billboard safety, said Bandyopadhyay.        
	According to civic officials, the greater the size of the billboard, more was the damage.                 
	Mayoral council member (parks and gardens) Faiyaz Ahmed Khan, who oversees the advertisement department, claimed damaged roadside billboards caused no major mishap on Monday since outdoor advertising agencies had replaced sheet metal hoardings with vinyl flex ones.         
	The storm had torn the flex sheets easily but the flying pieces did not cause serious injuries to pedestrians and commuters, said Khan.         
	Director-general (building) Debasish Kar said damage to flex billboards would have been much less if holes were drilled in them.        
	There are no sheet metal billboards in Singapore, Shanghai and other places abroad. Even the flex billboards have holes in them for passage of air, added Kar.

                                                                                                               Pension rap for state
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court has come down on the state education department for harassing a retired teacher by withholding his pension for his differences with senior leaders of a political party.        
	Durgadas Banerjee, 63, has not received pension for the past three months. He had to approach a division bench eight times since his retirement in early 2005 to get his pension dues till November 2008.         
	Banerjee came close to the leaders during his association with the partys teachers organisations. He dissociated himself from the party after differences of opinion with the leaders.         
	The teacher has been forced to knock on the door of the judiciary almost every month. How would you feel if you had to come to the court every month after retirement only to get your pension? the bench of Justice Tapan Sen and Justice Soumitra Pal asked the secretary of the education department.        
	The judges ordered the school education department to clear the dues by March 31. After disbursing the pension, the departmental secretary, district inspector of schools and the principal of Maharaja Kasembazar Polytechnic Institution, where Banerjee used to work, will have to file a compliance report, stated the bench.        
	Banerjee had taught in the institution from the early-1960s till 1999, when he was suspended on the charge of dereliction of duty. He had challenged the suspension in the high court, which in 2005  soon after Banerjee turned 60 and was declared retired by the school authorities  set aside the order, said advocate Biswadev Bhattacharya, who represented the teacher.

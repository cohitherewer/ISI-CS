The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pinki lensman in city 
                                                                                                               Pinki lensman in city 
          SUDESHNA BANERJEE                          Jon Shenk at work in the city. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                  
	The man who captured Pinki Sonkars smile on camera is here. Jon Shenk, the director of photography of the Oscar-winning documentary Smile Pinki, is shooting the first episode of a series called Revolutionary Optimists in Calcutta.         
	I have been following the work of Amlan Ganguly of the NGO Prayasam. He is empowering children in brickfields and slums through education and health awareness, says Shenk.        
	This is the Californians second visit to India after the trip to Varanasi in 2007, where he followed cleft lip operations of three children. Pinki was the cutest, he smiles.         
	The connection was formed after officials of The Smile Train saw his Emmy-nominated documentary Lost Boys of Sudan. Most organisations want such documentaries to be advertisements. But The Smile Train gave us full freedom. By the time, he reached Varanasi where the operation would be performed, director Megan Mylan had chosen the children.        
	People with cleft lips are difficult to look at. But the change from before to after is so dramatic that it is an incredible pay-off. The children, he admits, were shy and there was a language problem. But the access was incredible. The doctor was so practised that he had the confidence to let us shoot in the operation theatre.         
	Shenk says he had heard stories of children being abandoned by parents or their mothers by husbands over cleft lips. But parents of these children were supportive. It was great to film Pinkis mother weeping on meeting Pinki after the operation.         
	Shenk did not attend the Oscar ceremony but feels it must have been an amazing experience for the six-year-old. The girl did not even own a pair of shoes. Shenk started out in 1997 with a short film on the making of Star Wars. I learnt a lot watching George Lucas make a $150 million movie.         
	Now he is on a different orbit, travelling to brickfields in Ichhapur and slums in Rajarhat. Because of Prayasams work, rates of diarrhoea and malaria are dropping in these areas, points out Nicole Newnham, the co-producer of the project. The team returns to the US on Monday.

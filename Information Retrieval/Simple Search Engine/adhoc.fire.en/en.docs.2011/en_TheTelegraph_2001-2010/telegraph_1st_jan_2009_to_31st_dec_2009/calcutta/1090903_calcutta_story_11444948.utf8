The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Dupe charges pile up against stock firms
                                                                                                               Dupe charges pile up against stock firms
          ZEESHAN JAWED                                            
	Rajesh Sharma got a shock when his brokerage firm sent him a bill of Rs 9,000. The middle-aged private sector employee had hardly traded in stocks since opening a demat (dematerialised) account with the firm.        
	 Meera Daga, a 36-year-old homemaker, could not believe a monthly statement of transactions sent by her brokerage firm. The blue-chip stocks in her portfolio had been sold off without her permission, though the firm denied the allegation.         
	Cases like Sharmas and Dagas are becoming increasingly common in Calcutta, where the number of people logging into online stock trading platforms has gone up by almost 20 per cent in a year.         
	A senior official of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), the market regulator, told Metro that complaints against brokerage firms were on the rise.        
	We receive about 100 cheating complaints a month from investors against brokerage houses, said an official at Sebis Camac Street office.        
	Many first-time investors are opening demat accounts with brokerage firms. Firms are taking advantage of investors ignorance to tamper with their accounts, said a senior official of India Infoline, a brokerage firm.         
	The detective department recently arrested 26-year-old Siddartha Daga, the regional vice-president of brokerage firm Indiabulls for allegedly hacking into a city-based chartered accountants demat account to sell and transfer shares worth Rs 46 lakh.         
	Many of the complaints pertain to brokers trading shares without the consent of the investors. It is mandatory under the Sebi guidelines to inform the investor before trading in shares on his behalf.        
	The brokerage firm officials insisted that I had instructed them to sell off the blue-chip stocks. Only when I threatened them with legal action did they admit that they sold the shares without sending me contract notes, said Daga.         
	A contract note is the confirmation of trading which is supposed to reach the investor within 24 hours of trading.        
	Some firms also do not reveal the rate of taxation and the brokerage on certain products.        
	Investors are also losing money because of mismanagement of their account. Most people managing funds in brokerage firms are untrained. Many are high school dropouts. As a result investors end up making losses, said a Sebi official.

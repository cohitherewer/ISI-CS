The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Call for 1-day campus poll
                                                                                                               Call for 1-day campus poll
  - Fear of violence prompts govt to issue circular on election          MITA MUKHERJEE                                    
	The government is considering holding students union elections in all colleges in the city on a single day in an attempt to minimise chances of campus violence.        
	A circular issued by the higher education department asked Calcutta University to talk to college principals and explore ways for peaceful conduct of the polls.        
	During such meetings, the possibility of holding elections in all the colleges... on the same day may also kindly be explored, the circular reads.         
	Copies of the circular have also been sent to all district magistrates, urging them to club the elections at all colleges under their jurisdiction on the same day.        
	The circular cites the recent spate of student violence during the admission season to stress the need for extra caution during this years union elections.        
	Allowing the polls to be held in a staggered manner through November and December  as is the usual practice  would amount to risking a prolonged phase of campus violence across the state, said a source in the higher education department.        
	The principals of most city colleges have written to the university seeking adequate measures to ensure peaceful polls. The institution heads fear that spiralling political violence across the state, following the Lok Sabha polls which saw the near rout of the ruling coalition, would cast its shadow on the campus elections.        
	State higher education minister Sudarshan Ray Chaudhuri, however, told Metro that there was nothing new in the circular. Principals of many colleges ask for police deployment during the union elections every year. At the same time, there are institutions, including many girls colleges, where the polls are held peacefully.... But given the situation prevailing in some colleges, we think security needs to be stepped up during the student body elections.        
	Principals have welcomed the move to hold the elections on a single day but have sought an exception for some institutions.        
	We are not opposed to the idea of conducting the polls on a single day. But there are some colleges where classes are held in three shifts  morning, day and evening. In such institutions it is not possible to conduct the elections on one day. There should be some alternative arrangements, said Anjan Sengupta, the general secretary of the All Bengal Principals Council.

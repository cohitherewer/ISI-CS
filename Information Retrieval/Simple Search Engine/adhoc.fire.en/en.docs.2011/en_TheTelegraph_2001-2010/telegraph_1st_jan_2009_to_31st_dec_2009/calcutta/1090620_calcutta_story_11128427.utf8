The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hotel revamp trips on tenant, heritage hurdle
                                                                                                               Hotel revamp trips on tenant, heritage hurdle

	The revamped Great Eastern Hotel will open its doors in the last quarter of 2010, if there are no delays like the ones that have pushed back the early-2009 deadline.        
	The main structure and the new block will be completed by the beginning of next year. Interior designing and other work will take some more time, said Satya Roy Chowdhury, the resident manager of The Lalit Great Eastern, the new name of the hotel, spread across 2.3 acres in the BBD Bag area.        
	Construction of a building behind the heritage block, resistance from the employees union and eviction of around 60 tenants from the building that came up in 1950s (not a part of the heritage structure) and the front of the hotel are some of the reasons that delayed the revamp.        
	The leadership of Bharat Hotels could not envisage that laying the foundation of the new block would delay the project by eight months.        
	The original building, being a heritage structure, could not be tampered with. Construction of the new block at the back became a problem for fear of damaging the original building. We hired the services of a Bombay-based company that used state-of-the-art technology for piling and laying the foundation without damaging the original structure, said Chowdhury.         
	The tenants on the ground floor of the heritage block and the building behind it agreed to vacate the premises after a lot of persuasion. The process took almost a year, added an official of the hotel.        
	Negotiations and court cases are still on to remove two of the tenants.        
	The hotel was set up in 1840 by an Englishman who owned a confectionery shop in central Calcutta. It was then known as The Auckland Hotel.        
	Great Easterns decline started in the 1970s, as the then partners bickered over a financial crisis. The government took over the reins as the owners were on the verge of shutting down the hotel. Competition from other hotels hit Great Eastern badly in the 1980s and 1990s.        
	The state governments attempt to hand over the ownership to private parties in the early-1990s was stalled by the union. In December 2006, Bharat Hotels bought the hotel from the government for nearly Rs 52 crore.        
	According to the plan, when the hotel reopens, it would have 247 rooms, including 23 suites, an all-day dining and two speciality restaurants, a bakery, a 7,000sq ft ballroom, five conference rooms, a spa, a swimming pool and a two-level car packing facility.

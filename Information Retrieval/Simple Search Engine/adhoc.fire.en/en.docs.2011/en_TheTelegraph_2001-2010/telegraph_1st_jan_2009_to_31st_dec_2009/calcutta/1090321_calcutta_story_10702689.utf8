The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Deface vs efface race
                                                                                                               Deface vs efface race
                                          
	With The Telegraph blowing the lid off wall graffiti violations in Calcutta and North 24-Parganas, a relay race has begun to beat the Election Commissions stick. The baton in question? A consent note.        
	It goes like this. Once a graffiti gang finds itself in a spot for not taking prior permission to deface a private wall, it gets busy manufacturing pre-dated consent notes naming tenants/owners of the premises. These notes are submitted to the local police station. The local police station in turn reaches them to the constituencys returning officer. And so the deface race goes on.        
	Metro follows the consent note trail and encounters a typical pre-poll mix of bullying and bluffing.        
	WHAT POLITICAL PARTIES ARE DOING                
	The model code of conduct makes it clear that if permission is granted or submitted after the writing is on the wall, the graffiti must be wiped clean or the violators prosecuted. But the graffiti gangs of the CPM and Trinamul Congress have launched Operation Consent to make sure deface rules over efface.        
	The North 24-Parganas administration received a flood of pre-dated consent notes from political parties on Friday. Till late on Thursday, no consent note for wall graffiti on private walls had been submitted in Bongaon, Barrackpore, Dum Dum and Barasat, while Basirhat had received 65 such letters.        
	Till Friday evening, around 1,594 permissions had been deposited with us from the five constituencies, said Binod Kumar, the district magistrate of North 24-Parganas.        
	Political armies in the Barrackpore subdivision were the most pro-active with the count of pre-dated permission letters zooming from zero on Thursday night to 1,407 by Friday evening. Bidhannagar, Bongaon and Basirhat made up the rest.        
	On the subject of wall graffiti, rival candidates Tarit Topdar of the CPM and Dinesh Trivedi of the Trinamul sang the same tune in Barrackpore. Both claimed their paintbrush brigades were following every rule in the graffiti game.        
	Several police stations in the city also received consent letters submitted by supporters of both the political parties on Friday. While some were products of coercion, many others just put down the names of the tenants or owners of an address without obtaining their signatures, said some police officials.              
	WHAT THE POLICE ARE DOING        
	We have started suo motu prosecution in 30 cases, said Supratim Sarkar, the superintendent of police of North 24-Parganas.        
	Officers-in-charge of all 48 police stations in the city have sent complaints of wall graffiti violations to their respective returning officers, said an officer in Lalbazar.        
	Police in Calcutta have also initiated 20 suo motu cases against political parties for violating the model code of conduct governing wall graffiti on public walls.        
	Unlike the norms concerning private buildings where political parties need to take written permission before the paint job, graffiti writing on the walls of government buildings is banned by the Election Commission. Specific cases against the violators have been filed and the court has been informed about this, said an officer.        
	According to police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti, all officers have been repeatedly told to ensure there is no violation of the election code of conduct.              
	WHAT THE RETURNING OFFICERS ARE DOING        
	B.P. Gopalika, the returning officer of Calcutta South, said: We are taking violation of the model code of conduct on graffiti very seriously. We have served 81 showcause notices till Wednesday. We are also setting up a Violation Cell to closely monitor all violations, including those on graffiti. We are focusing on prompt action and redress in the matter.        
	C.R. Das, the returning officer of Calcutta North, said: We have served 405 show-cause notices for graffiti rule violations. In the past three days we have received over 150 letters of consent. As political parties and the people are waking up to the code of conduct on graffiti, more stress is being placed on acquiring consent. No violation of the graffiti norm will be tolerated.                    OUR BUREAU

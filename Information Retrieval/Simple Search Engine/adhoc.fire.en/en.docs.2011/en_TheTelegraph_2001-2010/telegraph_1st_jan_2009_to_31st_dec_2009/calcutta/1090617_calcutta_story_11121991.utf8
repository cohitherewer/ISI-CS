	A 37-year-old homemaker was found hanging in her Posta residence early on Tuesday. Around 1.30am, neighbours spotted the body of Radha Rathi in her ground-floor room on Shibtala Street and alerted Posta police station. Her husband Shyam, a trader, was not at home at that time.         
	The body was sent for post-mortem. Cops later said it was a case of suicide. No complaint has been lodged.         
	The post-mortem report suggested it was a case of death by hanging. We will start a probe if there is a specific complaint, said an officer. The police said Radha and Shyam have a 16-year-old daughter and a two-and-a-half-year-old son.        
	A preliminary probe revealed Radha was unhappy living with her in-laws and wanted to move out of the family home in Howrah.        
	Five months back, the couple moved into the Posta house  which also belongs to Shyams family  with their son, while their daughter stayed back in Howrah, said an officer.         
	Neighbours in Posta claimed they often heard the couple fighting late into the night.         
	The police said Radha had visited her parents home in Ganguly Lane in Posta recently and sought their help in putting an end to the fight with her husband. The parents had apparently asked her to settle the dispute on her own.

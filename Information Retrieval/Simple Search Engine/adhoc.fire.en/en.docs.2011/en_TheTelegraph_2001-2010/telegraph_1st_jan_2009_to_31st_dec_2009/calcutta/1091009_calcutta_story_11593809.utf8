          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A senior police officer has been showcaused in connection with the death of a thoroughbred of the mounted police which was hit by his car on October 5.        
	Caesars Hawk, gifted to the police by the race course authorities in 1999, was out on a morning stroll in the Maidan area when it was knocked down by the car of the deputy commissioner of police II (security control organisation), Satya Ranjan Roy.        
	Roy has been showcaused following a report on the mishap by the deputy commissioner (south), police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti said on Thursday evening.        
	Witnesses told sleuths that Roy was driving the aqua-green Santro (WB 06B 7330) with Sudhangshu Bose, a police driver, seated beside him.        
	The car swerved and hit the horse from behind when the animal was trotting down Plassey Gate Road.        
	The gelding lifted its legs  groaning in pain and throwing off a constable who was on the saddle  before crashing into the cars bonnet and collapsing into a roadside drain.        
	The horse was rushed to its home  the police stable on SN Banerjee Road  where it died six hours later.        
	The officer on duty at the accident site had reported that the car was being driven by Roy. But the formal complaint named Bose as the person at the wheel when the mishap occurred. The driver was arrested the same day but granted bail.

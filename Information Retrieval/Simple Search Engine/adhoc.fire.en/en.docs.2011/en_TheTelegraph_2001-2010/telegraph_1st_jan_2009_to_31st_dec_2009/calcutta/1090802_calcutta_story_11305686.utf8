The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Jewellers progress
                                                                                                               Jewellers progress

	Bonita Banerjees jeweller had a shop in Bowbazar. When she visited the store the owner would himself attend to her. He knew her preference, the right length of her earrings, the right thickness of her bangles. That was 30 years ago.         
	When Bonitas son got married, the jewellery for the bride came from this shop. Today Bonitas granddaughter swears by the jewellery at Tanishq. Diamonds and light contemporary pieces are what she likes.         
	But the granddaughter would be surprised if she visited the Bowbazar shop. It is no longer a shop  it is a store, endorsed by a top-rung Bengali film actress from billboards and eager to sell contemporary designs through its uniformed staff who never stop smiling.         
	At Anjali Jewellers Gol Park outlet, a well-dressed floor manager welcomes guests and guides them to the right counters. Last year, Anjali launched Nnoni, a silver and costume jewellery chain.         
	Family jewellers are changing into brands and the effect is manifold. It has changed not only the look and feel of the stores, but has generated new professions as well.         
	Subir Sen, director, B.C. Sen Jewellers, which has an in-house training facility for its staff, says he thinks of the store as a brand. He provides his customers with the certified quality one associates with a brand. All our gold jewellery is hallmarked. Our diamonds are certified by the Indian Gemological Institute, he says.         
	Other jewellers like M. Sirkar and Sons also provide hallmarked jewellery. A traditional jeweller would not offer hallmarking and certification even five years back.         
	The concept of franchisee has also entered jewellery. B. Sirkar Johuree is opening a new outlet in Malda, but its a franchisee.         
	Navin Sadarangani of NYUZ is a Mumbai-based entrepreneur who specialises in providing jewellery retail services. Calcutta is up there with the best when it comes to awareness and brand-building initiatives, he feels.         
	Sadarangani specialises in providing services that involve coaching for the front-office staff, consultation, concepts and creative retail services.         
	Jewellery retail is different from regular retail. People want to know about the gold, the gems, the labour charges. With more than 3 lakh retailers in the country theres a lot of scope, he says.         
	To appeal to the new-age customer, family jewellers are trying to build a brand identity. I would call them the progressive family jeweller. Its a format that combines the benefits of loyalty and trust that a family jeweller would enjoy with brand recall.         
	Of course the transition to brand is far from complete. Jewellers here are still to realise the importance of window display. Abroad, shop windows change with the season and follow a theme, he says.         
	Official recognition as a brand is yet to come. Jewellers here enjoy a loyal customer base, but they have no registered brand name. With the excise duty on branding removed in this budget, local brands should spring up in the next few months, says Bachraj Bamalwa of Nemichand Bamalwa and Sons.        
	Many big jewellery stores use celebs in ads. Well-known models are being used so that the recognition rubs off on the brand, says Sadarangani. But the ads of several big stores are still quite tacky.

           A luxury bus that may soon hit the city streets                           
	The report StreetCar Named Desire, dated February 8, speaks of what Calcuttans aspire for. We want a clean and green modern public transport system.           
	The mangled tin buses give tourists a wrong perception of our city. But I would like to add a few modifications to the writers idea of buses.           
	Noise limits for air and electric horns and sliding doors should have been added to the list. The best thing about sliding doors is that they open only when the vehicle stops. As long as the bus moves the doors remain shut. These doors also save a lot of space.           
	The ideal bus length of 32ft and width of 6.5ft will suit a modern well-planned city, not the narrow streets of Calcutta. The ideal measurements may create traffic congestion, as these buses will be difficult to manoeuvre in the city.           
	If the bus is smaller in length there should be one door, as two doors will take up a lot of space or lead to less space for seats. Our road condition has to be kept in mind before we phase out the 15-year-old vehicles.           
	The traffic is also a major concern. The state government should encourage people to use the mass transport system rather than small cars. Small cars clog the roads and slow down traffic.           
	Buses and SUVs should be the main vehicles for transportation. Not taxis and private cars. For those who travel by private cars, some luxury buses should be made available.           
	The need of the hour is small and narrow buses, which would suit the Calcutta roads. Large buses should be restricted.

	The article on the future transport system made me happy. Some 15 years back I had sent photographs of trams and buses taken in Melbourne, Bangkok and other places to the transport minister and the chief minister to start similar trams and buses in the city.   
	With the laying of the new tramlines and the launch of a few new trams, I feel that my dream of seeing modern public transport vehicles may actually come true.

	It is heartening to see that some people are still fighting for the revival of trams in Calcutta (Save tram, save city, March 22).             
	I thought trams would be lost from this city with the state government winding up services on certain routes and levelling the raised tram tracks with the road. The fact that travelling by a tram does not cause air pollution and is a jerking-free way of travelling is not being taken into account any more.           
	The links between the Behala and Kidderpore/Esplanade and between Kalighat and Ballygunge were temporarily discontinued to facilitate the construction of the Taratala flyover. But once the flyover was ready the tram service was not restored. It would be a good thing if the trams were brought back.

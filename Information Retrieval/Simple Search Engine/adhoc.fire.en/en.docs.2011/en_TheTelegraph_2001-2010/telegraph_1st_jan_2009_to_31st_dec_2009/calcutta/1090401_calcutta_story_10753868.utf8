The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Shampa told of loss
                                                                                                               Shampa told of loss
          OUR BUREAU                          Shampa Chakraborty                                  
	Shampa Chakraborty, hit by a car whose driver was drinking at the wheel, learnt on Tuesday that she had lost her unborn baby.        
	A doctor at Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratishthan broke the tragic news to Shampa after the dead foetus spontaneously ejected. She broke down on hearing the news, though she was too shocked to react, said husband Amit.        
	Doctors, however, said they were more worried about her multiple trauma than her mental shock. Once her condition stabilises, she will be operated on, said a doctor.        
	The 26-year-old, four months pregnant, was standing on the pavement in front of her house on Raja Basanta Roy Road on Sunday afternoon when a WagonR, driven by Vinay Singh, hit her after ramming into a lamp post.         
	She fractured her femur and pelvic bones and also suffered internal haemorrhage.        
	Shampas condition was critical and she had to be shifted to the intensive therapy unit, said a doctor.        
	We are praying for her early recovery. Doctors told me she was still critical, said Amit, who was beside his wife when she learnt about the tragedy.        
	Vinay and Ajit Gupta, another of the four men who were in the car that hit Shampa, are behind bars. Medical tests revealed both were intoxicated. The other two, Harjinder Singh and Pappu Walia, are yet to be tracked down. We suspect they have fled the city, said an officer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Experts rule out treasure
                                                                                                               Experts rule out treasure
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A team from the state archaeology department visited the zamindar-era Ghosh estate in Harinavi and ruled out the presence of hidden treasures. They, however, said some portions of the property could be preserved as heritage structure as they appear to be over 200 years old.        
	Led by Amal Roy, the state superintendent of archaeology, the team inspected the premises, parts of which were recently dug up following rumours of buried treasures.        
	Till date, no proof has been found to suggest that the site has any archaeological importance. So the question of ordering a dig doesnt arise, Roy said.         
	The owners are planning to engage a promoter to develop the property, keeping the Durga dalan intact. Roy said the Durga dalan and the sprawling courtyard adjacent to the Radha-Gobinda temple could be preserved as heritage structures.

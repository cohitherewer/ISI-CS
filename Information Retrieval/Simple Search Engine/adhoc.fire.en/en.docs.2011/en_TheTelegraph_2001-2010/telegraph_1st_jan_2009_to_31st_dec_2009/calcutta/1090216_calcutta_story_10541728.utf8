The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Student alleges party rape
                                                                                                               Student alleges party rape

	A 21-year-old engineering student attending a party in her classmates flat was allegedly given a spiked soft drink and raped by one of the guests after she became drowsy, according to an FIR filed on Sunday.         
	Police arrested three of the four boys at the party, including the host, and detained the remaining one although the FIR mentioned only 22-year-old management student Rishin Sengupta as the culprit. The girl said the other three boys in the group were silent accomplices in the crime that occurred exactly a week ago in a flat on Lake East Road in Santoshpur.         
	The SP of South 24-Parganas, Ajey Ranade, confirmed the arrests.         
	The third-year student told the police that she left to meet her parents outside town after the incident and decided to file the FIR only after consulting them.         
	An officer of East Jadavpur police station quoted the girl, who stays in the city as a paying guest, as saying that her parents encouraged her to speak out.         
	She called us on Saturday night and came to the police station this morning along with a relative to complete the formalities.         
	The girl said in her complaint that Rishin, a resident of Baguiati, was the only person in the group she hadnt met before. The host, Tanmoy, is a friend of hers. The other two, Mayukh and Parag, are students of another college who she knows through Tanmoy. All of them are aged between 20 and 22, the officer said.         
	He declined to reveal which of the three boys have been arrested along with Rishin. Although none among the three raped the girl, they didnt do anything to stop the prime accused either. A couple of them probably even molested her. We are investigating how that evening unfolded.         
	The girl will undergo a medical examination on Monday but the weeklong gap between the alleged rape and the test could be a hurdle in the investigation.         
	If the incident did occur last Sunday, we arent sure the medical examination will reveal anything. But a medical test is mandatory, the officer said.         
	According to the victim, she went to a party in which she was the only female guest because she trusted the host. Tanmoy, who lives in the flat alone, had told her that it would be a small get-together and that she wouldnt have to stay back late, the police said.         
	The girl had reached the flat around 5pm, by which time the prime accused and the other two guests had arrived.         
	The host served soft drinks and the girl picked up a glass as she chatted with the rest of the group. She doesnt know who spiked her drink but remembers feeling drowsy after a few sips. When Rishin forced himself on her, she was still in her senses but too weak to resist him, the investigating officer quoted the victim as saying.

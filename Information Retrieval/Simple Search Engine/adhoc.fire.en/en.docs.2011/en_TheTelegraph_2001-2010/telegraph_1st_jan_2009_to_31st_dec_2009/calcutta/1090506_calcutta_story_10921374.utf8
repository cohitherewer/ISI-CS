The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Abduction attempt on girlfriend
                                                                                                               Abduction attempt on girlfriend
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 25-year-old man allegedly tried to kidnap his former girlfriend from the Regent Park area on Tuesday morning. The youth and his three accomplices fled after being chased by residents and shopkeepers.        
	The girl, aged 20, later identified the youth as Sibnath Roy. Police have started an attempt to kidnap case against Roy and are looking for him and his accomplices.         
	The police said around 11am, the girl and her mother were walking her younger brother to school when Roy accosted her on NSC Bose Road.        
	A man suddenly appeared in front of the girl and tried to drag her into a Tata Sumo. She started shouting for help, which attracted our attention. We immediately chased the man, who fled in the car. Besides the driver, there were two other boys inside the vehicle, said Raju Das, who works in a neighbourhood supermarket.        
	After the incident, the girl and her mother and brother went to Regent Park police station and lodged a complaint against Roy and the others.         
	The police said the girl was a second-year student of a college in south Calcutta and had come to know Roy while working in a shopping centre. They had an affair while working together. A few months back, both left their jobs at the shopping centre. Of late the girl was avoiding him and had stopped taking his calls. She started going to college and Roy opened a business, said an officer, quoting the girl.         
	The South 24-Parganas superintendent of police, Ajey Ranade, too said the duo knew each other.         
	Probably at present they have no connection. Things will become clear after we nab the boy, he said.        
	The investigating officer said ransom might not be the motive behind the kidnap bid. The cops have learnt that Roy lives near Bansdroni in the Regent Park area and the girl lives nearby.         
	Right now the girl is traumatised. We will talk to her again after she regains her composure, Ranade said.

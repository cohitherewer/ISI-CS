The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rain but Orissa takes a bite
                                                                                                               Rain but Orissa takes a bite
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Orissa stole Calcuttas thunder on Wednesday with the deep depression that was to bring heavy rain to the city changing course and entering the neighbouring state.        
	The depression over the Bay of Bengal has moved away and developed into a deep depression over Orissa, leaving the city with only scattered rainfall, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.        
	According to the forecast for the next couple of days, the city will have to be content with intermittent showers rather than sustained monsoon rain.        
	But Debnath said the weather would remain comfortable despite the lack of heavy rain. Temperatures are likely to range between 27 degrees and 31 degrees Celsius over the next 48 hours, which is normal for this time of the year.         
	Cyclone Aila brought monsoon earlier than normal this year but the city and the rest of Bengal are likely to be around eight per cent short of normal rainfall. Several factors, including the El Nino phenomenon, have been blamed for it.

	June 20 saw the launch at Oxford Bookstore of a book chronicling the life and works of a veteran film-maker. Mrinal Sen: Sixty Years in Search of Cinema by Dipankar Mukhopadhyay was released by governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi.        
	Mukhopadhyay, whose interactions with Mrinal Sen started in 1979, claimed this book was different because I have linked Mrinaldas life and films with time, something he treasures immeasurably. Mrinaldas writings on cinema are also included.         
	Sen was in a light mood as he chuckled that everyone except the governor calls him Mrinalda, an endearment that he has come to treasure. He said he was grateful to Mukhopadhyay for doing a good job and for making him look better in the photographs! An audio visual presentation on Sen followed. Snippets from Padatik, Amar Bhuvan and Ek Din Pratidin were interspersed with the film-makers responses.         
	Gandhi congratulated the author on his meticulousness, rigour of scholarship and intensity of feeling. Our generation is fortunate to see your work in your company, he said to the film-maker, adding that he wanted to watch as many films of Sen as possible. Gandhi added that he was captivated by the sensitive handling of the Hindi-Chini issue by Sen in Neel Aakasher Neechey. He wondered how Sen could invest the smallest words and exclamations with such profundity.        
	Love in pictures        
	There were Mills amp; Boons, there was the Harlequin series and there was Barbara Cartland. And there was time.         
	But GeNext girls have no time. So Euro Books has presented 24 Star Love Stories in Pictures, as graphic novels, with titles such as Bitter Paradise, Three in a Flat or Hopeless Heart. The plot remains the same as in M amp;B, girl meets boy, falls in love, enter a villain, and everything falls in place with the kiss in the final page. Now imagine all this in pictures with garish colours and inane thought bubbles.

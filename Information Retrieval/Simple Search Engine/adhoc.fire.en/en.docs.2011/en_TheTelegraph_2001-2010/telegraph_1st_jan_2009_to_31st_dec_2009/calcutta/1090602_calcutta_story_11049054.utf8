The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bypass snarl over assault
                                                                                                               Bypass snarl over assault
          OUR BUREAU                          The Bypass snarl on Monday. (Sanat Kr Sinha)                                  
	The morning rush-hour traffic came to a halt on the EM Bypass, and in a ripple effect on several other roads as well, following a blockade by around 500 labourers.        
	The workers, hired by contractors engaged by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation to ferry garbage to Dhapa, were protesting the alleged assault by two men, Tarak Mondol and Manik. The duo, civic sources said, operate illegally in the dumping zone.        
	The blockade at the Bypass-DC Dey Road crossing off Silver Spring continued for close to four hours, from 8.30am. It was withdrawn after mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya turned up at the site and assured the protesters that police would look into their complaints.        
	He later said: The CMC has a moral responsibility to help the contractors but we cant be directly involved in the row.        
	When the blockade was finally lifted, the queue of stranded vehicles stretched up to Ultadanga in the north and beyond the Ruby roundabout in the south. The worst-hit stretches, apart from the Bypass, were Beleghata Main Road, Narkeldanga Main Road and the roads leading to the Hudco crossing.        
	The situation was unmanageable as the load kept mounting on arteries, including the Park Circus connector, AJC Bose, CR Avenue, Gariahat Road, Rashbehari Avenue and Prince Anwar Shah Road. Lorries stood bumper to bumper on Convent Bridge in Entally. It took two hours for the flow to normalise following the withdrawal of the blockade, said an officer of the traffic department.        
	Among the vehicles stranded on the Bypass were several ambulances and water carriers. My 13-year-old son has fractured one of his knees. We are stuck on our way to SSKM Hospital. My sons condition is fast deteriorating, pleaded Sunil Tapadar, in an ambulance that stood still near Ruby hospital for two hours.        
	At the protest site, the workers alleged that Tarak and Manik beat them up whenever they refused to do their bidding. On Sunday night, they assaulted six labourers with iron rods. Two of them were admitted to hospital, said Samar Bagchi, the driver of a garbage truck.        
	Civic sources said Tarak and Manik had forced the contractor hired to clean a sewerage canal in Dhapa to get the job done by them. But they have neither men nor vehicles. So they force labourers on garbage trucks to do the work.... If they refused, the duos goons would bash them up, said a senior official in the conservancy department.        
	He added that because of the Bypass trouble only 25 per cent of the citys garbage was removed on Monday.

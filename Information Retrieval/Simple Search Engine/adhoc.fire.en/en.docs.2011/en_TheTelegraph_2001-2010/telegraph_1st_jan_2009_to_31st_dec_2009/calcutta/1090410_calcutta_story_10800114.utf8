          OUR BUREAU                                                 One of the holes drilled on the Maidan by the DYFI during its rally    
	The police report that petitioner Subhas Dutta had dismissed as a pack of lies is the DYFIs sole defence against the armys affidavit in the Maidan-maul case.        
	The armys report is quite different (from the police affidavit). It claims that the norms laid down by the court were violated (whereas the police report gives a clean chit). Which report will the court accept? advocate Tarun Roy, representing the DYFI, asked the division bench of Justice B. Bhattacharya and Justice Tapan Kumar Dutta on Thursday.        
	The armys report was backed by photographs of the DYFI parking and cooking on the greens  both banned by the court  while the polices affidavit blamed hawkers and caterers, not cadres, for the mess the Maidan was in after the December 20 rally.         
	The police said during a hearing on February 6 that five persons were arrested and three LPG cylinders and an oven were seized during the rally, which had brought over 1.5 lakh people to the Maidan. Taking advantage of the huge gathering at the Brigade Parade Ground, hawkers and people in the catering business sold cooked food.The police immediately took action and arrested them.         
	When the hearing resumed on April 2, the army informed the court that the DYFI would not be allowed to hold another rally on the Maidan after what it did to the greens. It said the organisation was given the opportunity to restore the Maidan to its original condition after the rally, but it failed.         
	Roy claimed that the photographs appended to the armys report were not legible and, therefore, could not be regarded as documentary evidence of the Maidan being left in a shambles after that rally.        
	The bench directed the army to furnish the original photographs during the next hearing on April 27.         
	Apart from pointing out the difference between the police and armys versions of the rally and its aftermath, the DYFI said it was not the CPMs youth wing but an independent mass organisation of the youths of the country. It claimed to be a group of socially responsible citizens of the countryalso conscious of the human benefits resulting from preservation of ecology and environment and in no way less proud for (sic) the heritage of the city and its greenery than the petitioner.         
	Dutta, the petitioner, pointed out that the Maidan was ravaged for the second time in two months during the Left Front rally on February 9.         
	The court asked the police to file a report on that rally.        
	Two related issues came up for discussion during the hearing  traffic on the roads around Victoria Memorial and air pollution near the monument. The court asked the police to synchronise traffic signals near the monument to reduce pollution and the pollution control board to monitor air quality .

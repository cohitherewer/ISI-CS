The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | For her, a handy handbag is quantum of solace     She, thrust and parry
                                                                            Monday , November 16 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            For her, a handy handbag is quantum of solace     She, thrust and parry
  - Deo-girl episode highlights need for tote tools and do-it-yourself techniques for woman on the move          KARO CHRISTINE KUMAR                                              
	Forget diamonds, the handbag is a womans best friend. Doubt it? Ask Chandrima Gupta, who claims she survived a horror ride in a shuttle car thanks to the deodorant she whipped out and sprayed into the eyes of the rogue driver.        
	For todays woman on the move, the handbag and its regular contents need to double as self-defence tools (see box).        
	The idea is an element of surprise, to throw the assailant off-guard, be it by using objects found in every womans handbag (a pen or a pin will do), or even spitting in his face, says the special commissioner of police, R.K. Pachnanda.        
	Women are paying more attention now to what goes into that handbag. I am new to the city and being in unfamiliar surroundings makes me more vulnerable. A pepper spray or a powerful deo in my bag is a must, especially when I am catching a late night or early morning flight, says Smita, a young PR professional, who has an arsenal of three pepper spray cans.        
	Lynette Hilt, who sold a Cobra chilli pepper spray (Rs 499 for a 40g can) to Smita recently, says most buyers are young women. Deo works, but carrying something more powerful makes you feel safer. Many of my clients are airhostesses, models and college-goers. There are many buyers in Salt Lake, she elaborates.        
	Anumita, 26, of Salt Lake blames it on the dark, deserted stretches of the citys VIP township that make her feel unsafe, unless armed with a spray.        
	Giggles, one of the few stores in town selling the pepper spray (Rs 399 for 35g can), has seen a steady demand in recent times. We sell around one or two cans a week to young women, says the manager at the Park Street store.        
	The handbag itself can come in handy in a crisis. Dilip Kapoor, the president of Hidesign, lists how: Hold your bag by its strap and swing with full force aiming at the harassers face, or use the metal fittings on the bag to cause serious damage, or poke him in the eye with the pin that goes through the buckle, or just distract him by hurling your bag straight at him.        
	But sometimes being armed with handbag and spray may not be enough. For that, martial arts expert Amit Bhargava has a DIY (do-it-yourself) prescription.                                
	I encourage girls just out of college to spend those two lean months learning self-defence techniques. If you look physically fit, your chances of being attacked are reduced, says Bhargava, who was in town last month to fortify women at a Ficci event. He suggests lunging at sensitive areas like eyes, nose, throat and neck because the rest of the body, including the groin, are instinctively protected.        
	A combination of self-defence techniques and tote tools works for model Jessica Gomes. I learnt kick-boxing for two months. When I go home late after a show or a party, I always keep a nail file in my bag, which can be used as a weapon. Nowadays, almost every young woman carries one, she asserts.        
	The cops have a word of caution for women. They must be alert in taxis and shuttle cars, on deserted stretches. Dont listen to the iPod if that distracts you. You can even use red chilli powder or mouth fresheners to shock, said an officer of the south division who handles kidnap cases.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Gujarat saved as city took hit 
                                                                                                               Gujarat saved as city took hit 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The terror strike in front of the American Center in January 2002 was originally planned for Gujarat but logistical problems prompted Aftab Ansari to change the target, police claimed to have learnt from a youth allegedly involved in the attack.        
	Sadaquat, brought to the city from Mumbai on Sunday, told sleuths that Asif Reza Khan Commando Force, which had masterminded and executed the attack, found targeting Gujarat might prove to be risky, said an officer.        
	The outfit had already built a house in Hazaribag which the members were using as a hideout. Ansari found it would be much easier to set up base in Hazaribag and carry out the strike in Calcutta than travelling to Gujarat, said a member of the Special Task Force that is interrogating Sadaquat.        
	Ansari decided to launch a strike against cops following the death of his associate Asif Reza Khan, a resident of Mafidul Islam Lane in central Calcutta, in a police encounter in Gujarat. Asifs brother Amir was made a key leader of the Asif Reza Commando Force when it was set up to avenge Asif Rezas death.        
	Ansari had thought that since Asif and Amir were from the city, his men would get all support here in the event of a strike. The attackers had put up in the house of Nasir in Tiljala before carrying out the attack, said an officer.        
	Sadaquat, who was arrested in Mumbai last year in connection with serial blasts on local trains, even conducted a trial run in the early hours after selecting the location. It was Sadaquat who opened fire, killing six and injuring 21 others.        
	Sadaquat also told the cops that Asif and Bangladesh-based alleged terrorist Babubhai had planned to set up camps in the Sunderbans to train Indian youths in subversive activities.        
	As for Sadaquat, a senior officer said he had been involved in a series of blasts in Mumbai, Ahmedabad and Delhi.

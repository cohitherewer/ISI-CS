          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A racket dealing in mark sheets was busted on Sunday with the arrest of three persons, including the alleged kingpin.        
	Police stumbled upon the racket following the arrest of Kulada Kar, who allegedly submitted fake mark sheets to Calcutta University for admission to a law college on Saturday.        
	University employees suspected that the graduation mark sheets were fake and informed the registrar, who in turn called the police, said an officer of Jorasanko police station.        
	Kar allegedly said during interrogation that he had got the mark sheets from his uncle Tapas Mitra, who was picked up around midnight from his Dhantala home in Nadia.        
	Mitra said he had procured the mark sheets for Rs 13,000 from a resident of Ranaghat, who he identified as Tushar Sarkar, the officer added. Sarkar was arrested early on Sunday.        
	We are trying to find out where the fake mark sheets were printed. The students who collected such mark sheets will be tracked down, said an officer working on the case.        
	We have come across cases of students submitting fake Higher Secondary mark sheets bearing the stamps of Bihar and Jharkhand boards, the officer said.        
	At least six cases related to the use of fake mark sheets were lodged with Jorasanko police station last year         
	The police have also prepared a list of 14 lawyers who had submitted fake mark sheets during their registration with the bar council. Six of them were arrested last year.

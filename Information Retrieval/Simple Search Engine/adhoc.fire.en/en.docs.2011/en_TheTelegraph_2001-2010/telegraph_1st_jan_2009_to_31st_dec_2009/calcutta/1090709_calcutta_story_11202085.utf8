The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | JU translation course to begin this month
                                                                                                               JU translation course to begin this month
          CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE                          Jadavpur University                                   
	Students with a command of Indian languages will now be able to put their skills to use not just as interpreters but also as translators.        
	The Centre for Translation of Indian Literature of Jadavpur University has introduced a course on translation as a skill that will enable students to become professional translators.        
	The translation industry is going through a boom but there is a dearth of responsible and trained translators in India. We aim to bridge the gap with this course, said Sayantan Dasgupta, the coordinator in the Centre for Translation of Indian Literature.        
	The course spanning 300 hours over two semesters will provide intensive hands-on classroom and laboratory training in translation.         
	It aims to expose students to basic translation theory that explains the task and introduce them to people working in the translation industry, said Dasgupta.        
	Classes for the course, which will start on July 20, will be held from 5pm to 7pm on Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays and is open to students who have passed their Class XII examinations and have a good grasp of English and Bengali.        
	As an add-on course it will arm students doing their graduation with skills that will broaden their scope for employment, said Dasgupta.        
	The course will have academicians, professional translators, editors and publishers working in the industry conduct classes.        
	Students are often not aware of the various professions where translation is required. The course will showcase the opportunities, such as literary translation and translation for films, media and textbooks, said Dasgupta.        
	The centre is planning to organise a workshop on subtitling, which also needs translators.        
	Students who are part of the course will be able to work on translation projects of the Centre that will add to their portfolio along with two individual translation projects.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Faster flow for food stocks
                                                                                                               Faster flow for food stocks
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two thousand tonnes of sugar and pulses are moving out of the Calcutta Port Trust godown daily after rotting inside for more than 10 weeks from end-June.         
	Metro had reported on September 19 how sugar and pulses worth Rs 250 crore were stuck in the godown while prices of the items skyrocketed in the market because of a demand-supply mismatch.         
	The port trust had blamed the Central Food Laboratory for the delay in clearing the consignment, imported from various countries, for consumption. More than 25,000 tonnes of pulses and 15,000 tonnes of sugar have been carried out of the godown since.        
	We are satisfied with the progress in the delivery of sugar and pulses from our godowns, Anindya Majumdar, the port trust chairman, told Metro on Wednesday.         
	The rate at which sugar and pulses are moving out has picked up considerably over the past few days. On an average, 2,000 tonnes of sugar and pulses are moving out daily, said an official of the ports traffic department.        
	According to an official, the outflow from the godown increased after the Union health ministry authorised agencies such as Export Inspection Agency on Ezra Street and the Central Public Health and Drugs Laboratory in Convent Lane to analyse and clear samples of imported food items.         
	Anurag Tulsan, the co-ordinator of Pulses Importers Association, said: There has been improvement but it is not up to the mark. The authorities should expedite the process.

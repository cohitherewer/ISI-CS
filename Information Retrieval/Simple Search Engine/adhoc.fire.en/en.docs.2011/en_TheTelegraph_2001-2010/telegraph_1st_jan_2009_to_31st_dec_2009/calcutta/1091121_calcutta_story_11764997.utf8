The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CU date with result delay
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      CU date with result delay
  - Exam pushback, early pujas keep 1.8 lakh students waiting          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Around 1.8 lakh undergraduate students of Calcutta University are paying the price for the three-pronged attack on their examination schedules by the Lok Sabha polls, a Congress-sponsored bandh on July 17 and an indefinite transport strike.        
	The BA and BSc Part I and Part II examinees awaiting their results have been warned of a significant delay by the authorities still reeling under the hat-trick of postponements.        
	Last year, the Part I and Part II results had been declared on November 20.        
	We are not in a position to say when exactly the process of preparing the BA, BSc Part I and Part II results will be completed, Debashis Biswas, CUs deputy controller of examinations said on Friday.        
	The results are critical to the students academic future and so the examination department is apparently working overtime to compile the results as fast as possible.        
	Despite several constraints, we hope to announce the results by next weekend, said an official in the results section.        
	The university had to first reschedule several Part III exams in May as the dates clashed with the Lok Sabha polls. The postponement of the Part III exams forced the authorities to delay the date of commencement of the Part I and Part II exams for BA and BSc as well.        
	The Part I and Part II exams slated for July 17 then had to be pushed back because of a bandh called by the Congress.        
	The following week, the authorities had to postpone several Part I and Part II papers because of the strike by transport operators.        
	We have been racing against time in declaring the Part I and Part II results ever since those postponements, said an examination department official.        
	The early pujas just piled on the pressure. The Part I and Part II exams would have ended in mid-July if the original schedule had not been disrupted. But with the repeated rescheduling, the last exam was held on September 14, just three days before the university closed for the Puja holidays, said the official.        
	The end-September pujas delayed the process of distribution of answers scripts among the examiners. Many examiners could only be contacted after the vacation.        
	As a result, some examiners are still sending in their marks, stalling compilation. The process of preparation is getting delayed as the marks of students are coming in late, said an official.

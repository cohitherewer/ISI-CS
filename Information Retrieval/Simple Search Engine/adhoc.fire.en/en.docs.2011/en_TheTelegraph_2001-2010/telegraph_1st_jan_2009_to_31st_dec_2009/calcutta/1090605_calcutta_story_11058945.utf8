The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Toppers eye exit option
                                                                                                               Toppers eye exit option
  - State colleges dumped for better facilities, opportunity          A STAFF REPORTER                                              TOPPERS ON THE MOVE: Anish Chowdhury and (below) Swarnabha Chattoraj            
	Topping the West Bengal Joint Entrance Examination is one thing, pursuing medical or engineering studies in state institutions quite another.        
	At least six of the top 10 in JEE 2009 are looking elsewhere to pursue higher studies, in keeping with the trend of the best brains from Bengal leaving its institutions after high school.        
	Anish Chowdhury, ranked fifth in the medical list, can walk into Calcutta Medical College but he is waiting for his interview at Christian Medical College, Vellore.        
	My first preference is CMC Vellore, followed by Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research in Pondicherry, and Maulana Azad Medical College in Delhi. Calcutta Medical College has a lower ranking, said Anish.        
	Why leave his hometown? The topper points a finger at poor infrastructure and the failure to keep pace with newer technologies here.        
	State engineering topper Swarnabha Chattoraj from Bankura Zilla School can get into any college and course of his choice in Bengal, but the 18-year-old has his sights set firmly on IIT.        
	My passion is pure physics but I would still prefer to go to IIT for obvious reasons, said Swarnabha, who ranked 173 in IITJEE.        
	For many like Swarnabha, the non-IIT options in the state are a mere fallback.        
	One cannot deny that an IIT is a better option than a state-aided university like ours even though ours is one of the top engineering institutions in the country, said P.N. Ghosh, the vice-chancellor of Jadavpur University.        
	Once in a while we do get students from the top 10 in Joint, but we will have to wait at least another 20-25 years before our institution can be on a par with the IITs in terms of brand name, added Ghosh.        
	For Abhijeet Das, who ranked second in the engineering list, choosing IIT over a state college is a given.        
	Meritorious students deserve better lab facilities, the chance to interact with the best brains from across the country and better placement opportunities, he pointed out.        
	The other negative for toppers is campus politics in state-run institutions. There is too much politics in the colleges here. The pressure of studies is so much in IITs that it is impossible to think about politics, let alone pursue it, said Abhishek Roy, who ranked fifth in engineering and 133 in IITJEE.

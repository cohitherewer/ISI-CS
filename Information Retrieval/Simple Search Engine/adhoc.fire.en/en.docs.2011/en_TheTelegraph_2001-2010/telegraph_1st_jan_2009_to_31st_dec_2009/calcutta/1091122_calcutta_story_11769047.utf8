The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Arch rivals tie the knot 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Arch rivals tie the knot 
                          A staging of Letor Peto                           
	The musicians strike up a tune and the disillusioned chorus beckons the audience to come forward and be a leader they can trust, singing orey ekta bhalo neta hobi ai. Based on Nazruls Leto play Haridasi Methrani, Nabamayukh Natya Sangsthas new play Letor Peto uses a now forgotten tradition of Noto or Leto, which, as singer-researcher Debojit Bandyopadhyay recalls, was in the early 20th century an alternative to jatra. Small touring teams of actors using songs, minimal dialogues and costume made fun of the socio-political issues of the time. Nazrul himself began as a member of a Leto team writing and singing from age 13.         
	The peto (crude bomb) of political parallels will hit the audience after our show is done, laughs Rishi Mukhopadhyay who has edited and directed the play.         
	Songs used are mostly by Nazrul except those referring directly to contemporary events which have been written by group members.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Traffic patrol on key roads 
                                                                                                               Traffic patrol on key roads 
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Five teams comprising seven traffic cops each have started patrolling 33 key roads in the city from 11am to 5pm to prevent rash driving. The focus of the drive, which will supplement the vigil by the traffic guards, will be buses and minibuses.        
	These measures were decided at a meeting between police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti and officers of the 14 traffic guards in Lalbazar on Thursday. The sergeants would have to be more active and make the bus drivers follow traffic laws, an officer who attended the meeting quoted Chakrabarti as saying.         
	The patrolling started today and will continue for some time, said deputy commissioner (traffic) Dilip Banerjee. The roads being patrolled include Old Court House Street, Strand Road, MG Road, Dufferin Road, Mayo Road, APC Roy Road, CIT Road and Kalakar Street.        
	The four persons whose limbs were mangled in two recent road mishaps  which prompted the cop meet, according to sources  are stable.        
	The condition of Piyali Das, the 22-year-old crushed waist down by a bus at the CIT Road crossing in Beleghata on Wednesday, improved on Thursday. Relatives said she would undergo another operation on Friday.         
	Barun Chakraborty and his wife Jayashree, who lost an arm each in the Dufferin Road mishap on Tuesday, are also doing better, said a hospital official. The third victim, Ashish Paul, who also lost an arm, was pronounced out of danger by his doctor at AMRI.        
	The two drivers arrested for the mishap have been remanded in police custody till September 4.

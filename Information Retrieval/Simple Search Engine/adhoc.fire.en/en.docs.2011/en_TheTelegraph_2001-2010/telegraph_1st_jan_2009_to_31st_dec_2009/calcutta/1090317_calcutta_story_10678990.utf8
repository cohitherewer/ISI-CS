          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The relatives of a pregnant woman manhandled a doctor on Monday for allegedly administering an injection that could have harmed the foetus. The family of Deepali Das, 27, also lodged a police complaint against the doctor.         
	Deepali, a resident of Kasba, is four months pregnant. She was referred to Eastern Railways BR Singh Hospital for a scan of the thyroid gland on Saturday.         
	A senior doctor of the nuclear medicine department administered the intravenous injection  99M Technetium.        
	The doctor realised after administering the injection that Deepali was pregnant and refused to conduct the scan, said Deepalis husband Surojit.         
	The husband insisted that the documents he had submitted had mentioned Deepalis pregnancy but the doctor overlooked them.         
	A railway official said the patient party hadnt mentioned she was pregnant.

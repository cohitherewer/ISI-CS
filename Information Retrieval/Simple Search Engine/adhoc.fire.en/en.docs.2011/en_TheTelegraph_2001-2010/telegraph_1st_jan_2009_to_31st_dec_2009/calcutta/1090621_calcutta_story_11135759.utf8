	Why is it that fathers are never the heroes? In real life as in movies, they are often the character actors, always on the sidelines, but never the central player. No matter how male-dominated our societies are, have we for far too long seen fathers as second best?        
	I still remember the first time I saw an ad on Indian TV where the father of the house was breaking the mould. It was in the mid-Eighties, squeezed in between the delightful serials on Sunday morning. Dad was not just headed out, briefcase in hand, or solemnly reading the newspaper. He was shown cooking, that too for his wife, with the help of his toddler son. That ad was meant to show the new-age man, the father who was not only a breadwinner, but also had a sensitive side, someone who was cool and cooked breakfast for his wife on Sundays.         
	Fathers such as the one I saw that day are a very visible breed in the US. They do all the sensitive stuff that I never grew up with. They take on their equal share of diaper changes and family meals when they return home from office. They bicycle with their kids on summery evenings, attend parent-teacher meetings, or spend hours filling out college forms with their teenagers.         
	They make me smile, as I see my own son with his father, or as I watch other fathers playing ball with their kids in my suburban neighbourhood. The roles they play are very different from the fathers I knew back home. The fathers I knew were often larger-than life, but in spite of that, a quiet shadow. He was the one who paid for the family expenses, worked long hours, and was a family man only on Sundays. He spent time with the kids, but within clearly demarcated lines of fatherly duties such as supervising homework, or signing report cards or dropping the children to school.         
	But as I look back and as I get older, I realise they did much more. Along with those drops to school or the lectures on the value of education, they installed a foundation. Teachings that enable us today to stand on our own. Sure, they were not the confidante, nor the buddy, never the one who showered praise or kisses. But they gave many things more.        
	A fallout of a male-dominated society is that it is often our fathers we turn to when we want to explore. They are the ones who teach boldness, and self esteem. They urge us to reach for new horizons and go to new places. And more often than not they do this over a lifetime of advice, support and yes, even unsolicited meddling and interferences. So effortlessly they provide a sense of security, and an anchor for the whole family that it is easy to forget that it even happened like that. But it did.         
	The fathers of my dads generation may not have been the types who bustled in the kitchen or wanted to be my best friend, but I have come to realise that its okay. Yes, they were traditional fathers, and did parenting in the only way they knew how. But they still managed to give their children what every father wants to, no matter which culture or country they come from. A chance to move out from under their wings, become good adults and move ahead.        
	So to all the fathers out there, including my own, to all the unsung heroes Happy Fathers Day.       Oisika Chakrabarti   (The writer, a Calcuttan, works in Manhattan.

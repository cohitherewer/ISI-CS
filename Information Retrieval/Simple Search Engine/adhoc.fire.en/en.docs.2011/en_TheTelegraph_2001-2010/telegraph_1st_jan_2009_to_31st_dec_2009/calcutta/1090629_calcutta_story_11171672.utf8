The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hope of heavy rain in 48 hours
                                                                                                               Hope of heavy rain in 48 hours
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The weather and the power situation are improving in the city.        
	Calcutta and its suburbs received a thunderstorm at dawn and scattered showers throughout Sunday.         
	The weatherman forecasts heavier rain in the next 48 hours as the monsoon flow gathers momentum.        
	The city and its adjoining areas on Sunday received 19.4 mm of rain and the mercury touched a maximum of 31.8 degree Celsius, a degree below normal. The minimum temperature was also a degree below normal at 25.9 degree Celsius. The discomfort index was 58 degree Celsius, three points above normal, while the humidity ranged between 98 and 77 per cent.        
	The temperatures will gradually decline and so will the discomfort index, said the weatherman.        
	The citys power woes has also eased, thanks to a new source of power import.        
	Till 5pm on Sunday, there were no power cuts in the CESC-served areas. The total demand of around 1,100MW was met by CESCs supply of about 900MW and imports from various agencies.        
	The government decision to allow CESC to import 60-70MW from the Purulia pumped storage project is proving very useful for Calcutta. Shortfall in import led to deficits in the recent past, said a power department official.

                                                                                                               Rape of new-found friendship 
          OUR BUREAU                          The Santoshpur flat (encircled) where the girl was allegedly raped on February 8. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                  
	The 21-year-old student who was raped at a party on February 8 could have been any other young woman attending a get-together organised by new-found friends.        
	A group of friends meeting at someones place for an evening of fun isnt at all uncommon but an incident like this is new to Calcutta. This could lead to the boundaries of friendship being redrawn, said psychologist Moharmala Chatterjee.        
	Tanmoy Mayukh Borai and Saptarshi Sanyal, two of the three youths accused of raping the girl, had befriended their victim while travelling by train to the city from their hometown, Siliguri, one-and-a-half months ago.        
	It was small-town bonding. Like them, the girl is from outside the city and this may have forged the friendship faster, one of the investigating officers said.        
	Tanmoy and Saptarshi, final-year students of two leading private colleges, have been living for the past two years in the flat where the alleged rape occurred. Neighbours described the duo as normal boys who would often host parties in their apartment  owned by a relative of Tanmoy  but had never done anything to suggest they were wayward.        
	We couldnt have imagined they were capable of such a heinous crime, said Milan Sengupta, who lives on the second floor of the three-storeyed building.        
	Senguptas wife Sagarika said she heard loud music being played in the boys flat on the evening of February 8, when the girl was allegedly raped.        
	The third accused, Rishin Sengupta, stays with his brother in an apartment block on VIP Road. He is known in the neighbourhood as a wild child.        
	The brothers regularly throw noisy parties. Girls often come over and stay the night, said a neighbour who didnt wish to be named.        
	Another neighbour said Rishins father was an engineer in Farakka and his mother was the principal of a private college in Murshidabad.        
	All three accused have been booked under sections 342, 328, 376, 109,114 and 120B of the IPC for wrongful confinement, administration of sedatives/drugs, rape, abetment and criminal conspiracy.        
	Chatterjee said crimes like party and date rape were the manifestation of psychological problems in youth. There is a lot of frustration among young people and this leads them to wayward behaviour They do not think of the consequences.        
	Banasree Mani, a student of Calcutta University from Malda, said the girls experience had made her and many like her wary of making friends easily.         
	There are times when we trust people without realising that they could harm us. Those of us who stay in hostels and as paying guests are more prone to making such mistakes because we dont have our families around us. We actually need to be twice as careful, she shuddered.

                      In tune with Indian classical music                    Mick Taylor of the United Kingdom is an exponent of the difficult gayaki-ang or vocal style of sitar-playing. He is one of the very few Westerners to have expressed such a deep and remarkable interest in the study of the history, theory and practice of the subject. Having achieved the status of a solo concert artiste, his playing is specially noted for its depth of feeling (raag-dari) and for its authenticity. His serious study of Indian classical music and sitar playing began in 1969. His technique was originally developed with tuition from Ustad Imdad Hussain and later received guidance from sitar and surbahar virtuoso Ustad Imrat Khan, whom he regards as his guru. Taylor is widely known to have a deep respect for the purity and traditions of Indian classical music, specially that of the Imdadkhani gharana. This evening, this eminent sitarist from the West will present a solo recital, accompanied by Anuradha Pal on the tabla. Hosted by Rabindranath Tagore Centre (ICCR).                  Event: Sitar recital by Mick Taylor When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Satyajit Ray Auditorium, Rabindranath Tagore Centre (ICCR), 9A Ho Chi Minh Sarani

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Constable gets boot for booze
                                                                                                               Constable gets boot for booze
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A constable of the Reserve Force (RF) battalion was suspended on Wednesday after he was found drunk in uniform.        
	Sources said Dharmendra Singh was spotted unconscious on a pavement adjacent to the traffic guard (headquarters) building on Brabourne Road for over two hours on Tuesday night.        
	Cops in the traffic guard office refrained from removing Dharmendra after they identified him as a policeman. Around 2.30am, cops from Hare Street police station took Dharmendra to Medical College and Hospital.        
	Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters), said that though the medical test report of the constable was yet to arrive, doctors had suggested that excessive drinking had resulted in the black-out.        
	The constable was in his uniform but he was not on duty. He completed his morning shift and left, said Shamim.        
	According to policemen in the traffic guard office, they had spotted Dharmendra on the pavement around 11.45pm on Tuesday.         
	He was sitting on the pavement with his legs spread apart and was leaning against the boundary wall of the office, his head bowed. Some of us went near him but came back as he was reeking of alcohol. We sprinkled water on his face, but he didnt wake up, said a traffic cop.        
	Some of the traffic cops had wanted to bring Dharmendra inside the office.         
	But we opposed it as we realised that Dharmendra had committed a grave offence by drinking in uniform. It goes against our code of conduct, said a traffic policeman on condition of anonymity.

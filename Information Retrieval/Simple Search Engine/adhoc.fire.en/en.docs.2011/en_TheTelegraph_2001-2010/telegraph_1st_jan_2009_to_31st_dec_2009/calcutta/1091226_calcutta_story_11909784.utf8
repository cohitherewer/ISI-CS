The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 14-hour blaze in factory
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      14-hour blaze in factory
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A factory manufacturing jute products in Bally, Howrah, was gutted in a fire that raged almost 14 hours from Thursday night.         
	Fifteen fire engines were deployed to douse the flames in the 25,000sq ft factory on Jaibibi Road but strong winds and lack of firefighting arrangements made the work of firemen difficult.        
	Residents noticed smoke billowing out of the premises of Muralidhar Ratanlal Jute Export Pvt Ltd, one of the 500 factories in the GR Industrial Estate, around 10.30pm.        
	We immediately informed the fire control room as there was danger of the fire spreading to other factories in the vicinity, said Akhilesh Mishra, a resident.         
	The factories in the estate deal in inflammable materials but there isnt a single water reservoir in the compound. Since there was a low tide in the river we had to fetch water from Mullickghat pumping station. We found fire extinguishers were not working, said P.K. Dutta, the divisional fire officer of Howrah. The factory owner could not be traced and the extent of damage ascertained till late on Friday.

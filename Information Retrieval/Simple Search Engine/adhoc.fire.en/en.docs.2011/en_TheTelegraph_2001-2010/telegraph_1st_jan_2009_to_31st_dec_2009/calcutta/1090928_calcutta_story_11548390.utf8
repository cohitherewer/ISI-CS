The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A theme for Charnocks dream   Where the past is all we have 
                                                                                                               A theme for Charnocks dream     - What if the citys supposed founder returned to find a return to the roots										      CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYYA      PUJA POINTERS                                                
	More than 300 years after his death, the spirit of Job Charnock arose and decided to take a stroll around the city he is said to have founded, though there are other claimants. Charnock wanted to check Puja out in Calcutta. The noise had made him turn in his grave.        
	He landed on a narrow north Calcutta lane lined with old, crumbling houses in the early hours one day and found a row of mud huts with thatched roofs. The road was lined with cane lampstands, from which hung cane lamps, softly lit. The mud huts were neat, decorated with alpana patterns. In front of some huts were life-size human figures from Krishnagar engaged in agricultural labour. A tulsimancha stood with moss creeping out from behind terracotta tiles. The effect was very pretty.        
	The able administrator of the East India Company spotted someone he could ask for an explanation, wanting to maintain an imperious, lofty tone and the imperative mood. It was a successful colonial strategy. Charnocks interlocutor was a young native, who seemed to be walking alone talking to himself.        
	Hark. Pray young man, I had heard of immense development in Calcutta, but the newest constructions are mud-houses. Forsooth. Explain, he said. The young man took off something from his ears and looked at him. Its a theme puja. Its a trope in the development narrative. Its about the recovery of our past, decolonised and ethnicised. The empire strikes back with terracotta tiles.        
	By the Imperial Majesty, elaborate! said Charnock, not the submissive type. A theme is a puja in which a village is done up. With stuff that you can dismantle and keep in your drawing room, said the young man, cool.              
	But during my time, there was no interior dcor, said Charnock, a little less loud. Tell me more, swain, he added as an afterthought.        
	Cane and bamboo are quite popular in theme pujas, too. We are rediscovering all kinds of leaves and plants, such as shalu, shapla, hogla, continued the young man.        
	As he spoke, the young man grew voluminous, as if he was speaking to a television camera. Everything is elevated to artwork. Everything should look like it is a set waiting for the TV camera. It is post-colonial, post-modern, deconstruction-friendly and decorative, said the youth.        
	Do you always do villages? asked Charnock.         
	Mostly, for they come with the opportunity to showcase folk art. In real life the villages of Bengal are unbearable. This is the only version in which they can exist. This is actually the global village. When we run out of villages, we can always fall back on old temples or old broken zamindar houses, with the moss creeping out of terracotta tiles, answered the native.        
	Why is it the past always? asked Charnock.         
	That is all we have. But we dont call it the past any more. We call it sabeki. It is really decorative, such as Bipasha Basu in a lal-pere sari and a sindur tip, said the young man and then something went off in his pocket that went: Dekho re, nayan mele We also call it bangaliana, he said and walked off. Like the Bengali platter at restaurants now.        
	Charnock went back to his grave, now downright pensive, thinking that in his time Sutanuti and Calcutta were better off as villages.

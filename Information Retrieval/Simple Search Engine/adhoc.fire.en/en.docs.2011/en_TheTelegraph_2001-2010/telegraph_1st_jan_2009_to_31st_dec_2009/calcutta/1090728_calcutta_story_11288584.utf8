The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Transport dept fined
                                                                                                               Transport dept fined
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Monday asked the transport department, the director of the public vehicles department (PVD) and Bhagwandas and Company to pay token costs of Rs 100 each for delay in filing affidavits in a taxi meter checking case.        
	Justice Jayanta Biswas, however, allowed the affidavits-in-opposition to be filed during the day.        
	Taxi unions had moved the court on April 1 challenging a transport department notification asking taxi owners to get their meters checked at a Salt Lake facility.        
	The unions are opposed to a private company, Bhagwandas, carrying out the checks and charging a fee for it.        
	The judge had asked the transport department, the PVD director and Bhagwandas and Company to file affidavits-in-opposition within five weeks.        
	The lawyers representing the respondents (the departments and the company) appeared before the judge today and sought permission to file the affidavits. The court allowed the lawyers to file the affidavits but imposed a fine of Rs 100 each, said a court official on Monday.        
	Justice Biswas adjourned the hearing for three weeks and asked the taxi associations to file their replies by two weeks.

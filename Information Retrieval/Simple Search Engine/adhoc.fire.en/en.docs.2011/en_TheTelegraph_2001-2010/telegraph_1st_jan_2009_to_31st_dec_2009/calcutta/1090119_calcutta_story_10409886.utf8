                      Fusion of taal and tantra                     The first Portuguese encounter with India was on May 20, 1498, when Vasco da Gama landed in Calicut (Kozhikode). Since then, the Portuguese influence on ecclesiastical and to an extent, social life of the country, specially in Kerala, has been noteworthy. One such creative soul, Enzo Mayo, was intuitively drawn to Hindustani and Carnatic classical music long before he was aware of his Indo-Portuguese lineage. The mellifluous strains of L. Subramaniam, Balachander, Ali Akbar Khan, Lakshmi Shankar and their ilk seeped in through his entire being, providing him with tranquillity and igniting his creativity. The rhythmic notes of sacred music inspired him to paint exuberantly. And then, in 1998, he discovered the intrinsic beauty of Indian classical dance when he watched Lila Armoudom and Paulic Sabine perform. He offered to collaborate with them in their production, Natya Yoga, followed by their next production, Thousand Petals. For this, Enzo Mayo painted seven canvases based on the ancient tantric motif of the Chakras. Mesmerised by the ancient Indian iconography, his next project was again with Lila in 2005, and this time it was based on sringara rasa. Mayo changed his medium and worked on video mode for this project that was set to music by O.S. Arun. In June last year, Mayo was invited by ICCR, and this time he began exploring and interpreting shringara/ kama-tantra in a series where he mixed digigraphy with touch painting. His works display a fusion of both Indian and European art styles. An exhibition of his works will be inaugurated this evening at 5 pm by Dr Bharati Ray, vice-president, ICCR.

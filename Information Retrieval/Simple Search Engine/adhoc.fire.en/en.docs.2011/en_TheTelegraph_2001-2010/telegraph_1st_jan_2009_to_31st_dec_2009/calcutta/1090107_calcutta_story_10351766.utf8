The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A peek into hooch dens
                                                                                                               A peek into hooch dens

	The government woke up to the hooch menace only after it claimed 27 lives in the port area over the past three days. While police smashed several illicit liquor dens in Ekbalpore, Taratala, Chetla, Beleghata and Salt Lake, Metro takes a peek into those that are still functioning.              
	Where: Sahapur, Behala        
	When: 12.45 pm        
	What we saw: Two small bamboo sheds behind Gholeshapur market is popular among a section of the residents as Madhaier Thek. A steady supplier of hooch for the past two decades, the thek now registers a footfall of over 250 every day. The daily sale is believed to be Rs 5,000. A man in his late-30s was seen sitting in a makeshift stall, selling hooch packets.        
	Peoplespeak: The ongoing police action on liquor dens is an eyewash. Madhaier Thek was razed several times but the men got back to business every time after a couple of days, said Rasbehari Roy, a resident of the area.              
	Where: Dhakuria railway tracks        
	When: 2.20pm        
	What we saw: A number of men, women and children were found selling hooch in pouches and red and blue glasses beside the railway tracks under Dhakuria bridge, hardly 500 metres from Lake police station.        
	The daily sale is around Rs 15,000, with each pouch priced at Rs 10. Even at night hooch is freely available from the shanties nearby at Rs 10 a pouch.        
	Peoplespeak: The den was earlier located near Gobindopur railway colony. After the slums beside the railway tracks there were removed, the hooch-sellers shifted base to Dhakuria, said Anath Mullick, a resident.              
	Where: Under Tollygunge railway bridge        
	When: 3.30pm        
	What we saw: A number of truck and taxi drivers, as well as local residents, were seen emerging from three shanties holding hooch pouches in hand. The shanties, a kilometre from Chetla police station, are known in the locality as Ahladir Thek.        
	Peoplespeak: Among the customers are a few constables. The cops, in return of free liquor and a weekly protection fee of Rs 100 each, turn a blind to the dens, said a shanty-dweller who did not want to be identified.              
	Where: Chowlpatty-Beleghata        
	When: 4.50pm        
	What we saw: The area along Canal East Road was deserted as police had conducted raids on Monday and destroyed the illegal stalls. But as one enters the alleys off the opposite flank of the road it becomes apparent that the shops had just shifted base. A hooch pouch is being sold at Rs 15 and country liquor at Rs 70 a bottle.        
	Sellerspeak: The rates are a bit high after the crackdown. But dont worry they will drop again. Policer sathe hoftar setting ache.        
	What the police say: We have destroyed 16 shanties that doubled as hooch dens, seized more than 1,500 litres of spurious liquor and arrested 37 men across the city till Monday. The raids will continue at least till Sunday, said joint commissioner of police Pradip Chattopadhya.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | State caught in school DA knot
                                                                                                               State caught in school DA knot
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The recent pay hike has put the state in a fix over the dearness allowance (DA) it pays to the teachers of around 60 Christian missionary schools in the state.        
	The managements of these schools  including St Xaviers and Loreto and Don Bosco branches  pay the basic salary to their teachers while the DA comes from the government.        
	The teachers of the schools now get DA at 91 per cent of their basic pay, which the managements want to be retained but the state finds it difficult to sustain. Following the implementation of the Fifth Pay Commissions award, the state has decreased the DA of state-aided schools from 41 to 16 per cent of the basic pay.        
	In the earlier pay scale, the starting salary of a teacher in a state-aided school was Rs 6,000. Post-hike, the figure stands at Rs 13,400. The DA, according to the new rate, would come to Rs 2,144. But for a teacher of one of the missionary schools whose basic pay is Rs 6,000, the DA  at 91 per cent  is as high as Rs 5,400.        
	The missionary schools obviously want to maintain the status quo. We will have to decide whether we can continue with the 91 per cent DA, which is quite high following the implementation of the pay panels award, said an education department official.        
	We have not yet finalised the new formula. We will ensure that the DA-getting schools are not affected, said Sukumar Mahapatra, the joint secretary in the school education department.         
	The missionary schools are saying they may be forced to increase students fees if the government scales down the DA rate.        
	One must understand the government provides the entire pay packets for the teachers of the state-aided schools. As for the missionary schools, the state gives only the DA. The schools largely depend on tuition fees. If the state decreases the DA percentage, we may have to raise the fees to meet the shortfall. Its the guardians who will suffer, said Father Faustine Brank, a member of the Association of Christian Schools.        
	The association will meet education department officials and request them to continue with the old DA rate.        
	Worried over the tussle between the government and the schools, the teachers of Anglo-Indian institutions have called a meeting to discuss the issue.        
	The state has revised teachers pay scales and we are entitled to a salary according to the new scale, said Richard Gomes, of Don Bosco, Liluah.

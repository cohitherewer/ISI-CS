The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cops to fight JU ragging 
                                                                                                               Cops to fight JU ragging 
  - Students protest decision to bring in outsiders          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Jadavpur University has decided to include police and other outsiders in its drive to root out ragging from the campus, ignoring protests from students.        
	The authorities also announced that a squad set up to prevent ragging would step up its vigil.        
	Five days after the vice-chancellor and a few other officials had to spend 17 hours in captivity for suspending a student found guilty of ragging, the university on Tuesday announced that people from various walks of life would be included in the anti-ragging committee for better monitoring of student activities.        
	Parthapratim Biswas, a member of the universitys executive council, said the reconstituted panel would include representatives of the police, district administration and NGOs, as well as journalists and eminent personalities from the locality.        
	The existing committee, set up in 2006, only comprises representatives of the students, parents and teachers.        
	The panels job is to receive complaints of ragging, order inquiries, go through reports, and recommend punishment.        
	A section of students protested the decision to bring in outsiders to tackle what they said was an internal problem.        
	Ragging is our internal problem and we must solve it ourselves. We dont think outsiders, such as representatives of the police, district administration and NGOs, can stop ragging on the campus, said Abhisek Chakraborty, a leader of the faculty of engineering and technology students union.        
	Elaborating on the second strategy to stop ragging, an official said the special squad would conduct raids across the campus, including canteens and hostels, at any time of the day round the year. Sources said the squad now functions only for a few days after freshers move in.        
	The students are also opposed to an over-active squad. The squad had maintained vigil before but that hardly helped stop ragging, alleged another student leader. The authorities are trying to play up small incidents of ragging for no apparent reason.        
	Rajiv Das, a third-year student of mechanical engineering, has been suspended for a semester for ragging Kamal Krishna Halder, a first-year student of international relations. Students had gheraoed the VC and other officals for 17 hours demanding that the suspension be revoked.        
	Pro vice-chancellor Sidhartha Dutta, however, asserted that the university was firm in its stand to punish students found guilty of ragging.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fun fest at Kharagpur
                                                                                                               Fun fest at Kharagpur
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The grim job market has dampened neither the spirit of the IIT Kharagpur students nor their love for innovation as they hold their annual techno-management fest, Kshitij.         
	This is the best platform for students to showcase their talent, whether in robotics or creating business plans or writing technical papers. The time is opportune, especially since jobs might be hard to come by, said Ankur Gupta, the organising team head of Kshitij.        
	The fest, with The Telegraph as media partner, started on Thursday with a panel discussion on the global economic meltdown and how India can benefit from it. The fest ends on February 1.        
	Day One saw over 3,000 students from colleges across the country registering for various events and workshops.        
	The main attractions were a lecture by Christopher McKay, a planetary scientist from Nasa who serves as the director of the Mars Phoenix Mission, and The Secret Door, where performers from Canada created art works with light.        
	Fun with light continued through a performance by Laserman from Rome, the only man in the world who can do hand modifications of laser lights, on Friday. Geneva-based Lumen will put up another show with lights.        
	Also on the cards are lectures by ad guru Prahlad Kakar, the father of supercomputing, Philip Emeagwali, and Kurt Wuthrich, a Nobel laureate in chemistry.        
	But the events are the mainstay of the fest, added Gupta. About 30 technical and 15 managerial events, spanning the fields of coding, electronics, robotics, structures, entrepreneurship and quizzing, are held during Kshitij.        
	The big draws are Kyrotech, where students have to design a heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system for a building, The Grand Central, in which budding architects and designers are asked to redesign Kharagpur railway station, and Laws of Motion that calls for the construction of a remote-controlled glider to drop a projectile using a mechanical contraption.        
	Workshops on film-making by Jeremy Bristow of the BBC, on forensic science by a group of scientists from the Central Forensic Science Laboratory, and space communication by the Indian Space Research Organisation have also been organised.

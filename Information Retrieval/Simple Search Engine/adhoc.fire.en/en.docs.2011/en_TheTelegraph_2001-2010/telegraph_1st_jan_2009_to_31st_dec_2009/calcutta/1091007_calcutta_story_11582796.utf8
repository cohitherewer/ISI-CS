The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Row over UGC rule
                                                                                                               Row over UGC rule
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Research scholars from various universities in the state have come together to protest the University Grants Commissions decision to withdraw the exemption granted to PhD and MPhil degree holders from appearing in the NET or SLET.        
	Around 40 scholars from Calcutta, Jadavpur, Kalyani and Vidyasagar universities submitted a memorandum to officials in the UGCs regional office in Calcutta, seeking a clarification of the order.        
	The scholars demanded that those who got their PhD/MPhil degree or registered for the programmes between 2006 and July 2009 (when the rules were changed) be kept out of the purview of the revised guidelines.        
	In a 2006 order, the UGC had declared that candidates with a PhD degree need not sit for the NET/SLET for lectureship at the postgraduate and undergraduate levels. Similarly, candidates with an MPhil degree were exempted from the NET/SLET for undergraduate lectureship.        
	The exemption was withdrawn in the July 2009 notification.

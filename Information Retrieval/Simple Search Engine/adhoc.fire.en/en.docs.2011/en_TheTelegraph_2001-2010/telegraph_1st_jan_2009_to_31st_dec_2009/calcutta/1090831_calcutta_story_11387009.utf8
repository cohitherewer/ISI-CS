The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Traffic hits downturn air pocket
                                                                                                               Traffic hits downturn air pocket

	Passenger footfall at Calcutta airport has taken a beating, dropping four per cent in the first quarter of 2009-10 compared with the same period the previous year.        
	Cargo traffic has taken even a bigger hit, reeling from a 10 per cent negative growth.        
	A survey at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport has revealed that international passenger movement has gone up by two per cent against a five per cent slide in the number of domestic fliers, causing an overall dip of around four per cent between April and June.        
	The number of international flights from the city has gone up by 20 per cent (mostly on south and Southeast Asia sectors) but domestic flights have come down by 10 per cent.        
	This was in sharp contrast to fiscal 2006-07 which saw a 42 per cent rise in domestic movement and eight per cent rise in the international sector, on the wings of a buoyant economy.        
	The trend sustained through the next two fiscals before crashing under the blow of the global meltdown. The economic downturn is responsible for the drop in passenger movement, said airport director R. Srinivasan.        
	The director, however, held out hope, saying the market was showing signs of a turnaround.         
	We are expecting the domestic passenger and aircraft movement to record a positive growth by the end of this financial year, Srinivasan said.        
	Aviation and travel industry sources attribute the two per cent growth in international traffic to an increase in trade activities and the recent introduction of additional flights to Bangkok and Dhaka.         
	The introduction of low-cost carriers to Southeast Asia and Dhaka has resulted in more passenger movement on the routes. Business traffic constitutes the maximum load, said Anil Punjabi, the chairman (east) of the Travel Agents Federation of India.        
	The recent buzz in trade notwithstanding, international cargo movement at the city airport is still facing a slump, registering a 10 per cent decline in the first quarter.         
	Between April and June, around 9,000 metric tonnes of cargo moved in and out against 10,000 metric tonnes in the same period last year.        
	Leather goods and garments formed the bulk of the export from Calcutta. But with retail in doldrums, these products are not finding many takers, said Amin Khan, the manager (eastern India) of Singapore Airliness cargo division.        
	The airline had in May withdrawn its freighter service from Calcutta.         
	But export has started picking up again and we are planning to reintroduce the freighter soon, Khan said.        
	Only 30 per cent of the new integrated cargo terminal is being utilised.         
	We have requested the government to route more cargo through the airport for optimum utilisation of the facilities, said an airport official.

  - Villagers find body of youth who boarded train to Patna          OUR BUREAU                                    
	A 32-year-old man, travelling to Patna by train for official work, was found dead beside the railway tracks in a village in Hooghly district on Monday morning.        
	Debopriya Roy, whose body was found 15 feet from the tracks between Begampur and Baruipara stations, 20km from Calcutta, worked as an area sales manager of a computer institute in the city.        
	A probe indicated he fell off the train. There were deep injury marks on the back of his head. We are waiting for the post-mortem report, said Rajeev Mishra, the superintendent of Hooghly police.        
	The cops said Roys suitcase contained a number of invitation cards for his marriage, which was scheduled for May 10. The youth lived with his parents in an apartment in Thakurpukur.        
	Family sources said Roy had boarded the Danapur Express from Howrah on Sunday night along with his aunt Tapati Majumdar.        
	Roy was booked on an AC coach while Majumdar, a resident of Patna, had a ticket for a sleeper class.        
	Roys uncle said both boarded the sleeper-class coach. The two had dinner together around 10pm, after which Debopriya left for his coach with his bags, said the uncle who did not want to be named.        
	That was the last time Majumdar saw her nephew. She learnt about his death after reaching Patna.        
	Its not clear whether Roy had reached his seat as, according to railway sources, the vestibules connecting the AC coaches with the rest of the train usually remain shut.        
	GRP officers suspect Roy had got off the train during an unscheduled stop between Begumpur and Baruipara in an attempt to board his designated coach.        
	The train might have started moving when Roy was about to board the AC compartment. He was being dragged along by the train when he suffered the head injuries that might have led to his death. One of his shoes was found a few feet from the body, along with his suitcase and a bag containing a laptop, said a GRP officer.        
	This theory, however, does not explain why the body was lying 15 feet from the tracks.        
	Villagers spotted the body around 6.30am. The youth was clad in a white shirt and blue jeans. A cellphone, a laptop and a briefcase were scattered around. I called up his family members from his cellphone and informed them about the mishap, said Nazrul Haque, a villager.        
	Roys sister Madhumita Sarkar and her husband rushed to the spot and identified the body.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Salt Lake jeweller missing for four days
                                                                                                               Salt Lake jeweller missing for four days
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Parimal Dutta                                  
	Salt Lake-based jeweller Parimal Dutta, who went missing on Monday, could not be traced till late on Thursday. Burtola police, in whose area the man was allegedly last spotted, have started an investigation along with North 24-Parganas police.        
	Dutta, 45, a resident of Karunamoyee Abasan, had told his family and employees he was going to Goranhata market in Sovabazar, under Burtola police station, to buy gold ornaments. Dutta runs a jewellery store in CK market and another in IA Block.        
	His family lodged a missing complaint with Bidhannagar East police station on Tuesday afternoon after he failed to return. There has been no ransom call yet.        
	The cops have learnt that Dutta had earlier stayed away from home for days without informing the family. But as the incident comes close on the heels of Kafila co-owner Mukesh Jaiswals disappearance from City Centre and subsequent murder in March, the cops are not taking any chance.        
	We have alerted all nearby police stations, said an officer. The cops are also tracking Duttas cellphone, which has been switched off since Monday afternoon.        
	We are probing if Dutta had any business rivalry or family problems, said the officer.        
	He was a soft-spoken person and never got into any dispute. Even his business was controlled by his family members, said Suman Sen, Duttas nephew who looks after the jewellery shop at CK market.        
	Sen said Dutta had left the shop on Monday around noon. His wife called him at 1.30pm from her in-laws house at Ultadanga. My uncle said he was in Sovabazar and would reach Ultadanga in 20 minutes. But his phone was switched off soon after, he said.        
	The family later found out that Dutta hadnt visited the shops he was planning to go to.        
	Dutta has a 17-year-old son and an eight-year-old daughter.        
	Burtola police spoke to Duttas son Arup on Thursday. The family claims Dutta last called up from our area. That is why we have kept a photograph of him and have started an investigation, said a senior officer of Burtola police station.

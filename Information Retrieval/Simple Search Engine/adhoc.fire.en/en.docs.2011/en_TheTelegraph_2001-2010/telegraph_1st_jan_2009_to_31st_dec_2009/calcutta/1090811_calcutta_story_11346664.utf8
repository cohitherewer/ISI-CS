                                                                                                               Bus tours of the city 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                              Satabdi Roy and Sultan Ahmed launch a city sight-seeing bus service in front of Victoria Memorial on Monday. A Telegraph picture              
	Tourists to the city will now have a choice of government-guided tours. A city sight-seeing tour was flagged off on Monday by actress-MP Satabdi Roy and her Trinamul Congress party colleague and Union minister of state for tourism Sultan Ahmed in front of Victoria Memorial. The state tourism department also has a daily bus tour on offer, though covering different spots.        
	The India Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC) initiative is a revival of a service that had been discontinued in 2002. Tourists coming to India land in Delhi, tour Agra, Jaipur and at best Himachal Pradesh, and leave without exploring this part of the country. Our plan is to draw them to the east and northeast, centering on Calcutta, said Ahmed. The ministry is hosting a two-day roadshow in Calcutta to promote the region from Tuesday.        
	The non-AC bus, which took streetchildren on a joyride on Monday, will start from the department of tourism office on Shakespeare Sarani daily at 8am. For a Rs 200 ticket (minus food), it will take passengers as far as Belur Math and Dakshineswar temple while covering routine city spots like Indian Museum and Mother House.         
	The department is also working on a memorandum of understanding with Iskcon authorities. There is a demand for travel to Mayapur. We want to provide tourists with boarding and lodging facilities through Iskcon, Ahmed said.        
	Another initiative will please residents of the districts. The ITDC will run buses from Howrah, Nadia, Hooghly and North 24-Parganas for pandal-hopping in the city. The uniqueness of this service is it will originate and terminate in the respective districts, Ahmed pointed out. The starting points have not been decided yet.        
	Tickets will be sold from the Everest Building office of ITDC and the Hatibagan office of service provider North Bengal Tours amp; Travels. The tourism office will open a counter from next week. Before Puja, another counter will open at Howrah station.

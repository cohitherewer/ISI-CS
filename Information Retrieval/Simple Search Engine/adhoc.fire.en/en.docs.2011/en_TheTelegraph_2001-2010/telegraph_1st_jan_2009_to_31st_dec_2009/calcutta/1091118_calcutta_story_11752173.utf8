          A STAFF REPORTER                          Mamata Banerjee at the Rabindra Sadan programme on Tuesday. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                  
	The Metro Railway will spread its network to the citys adjacent districts, Mamata Banerjee said on Tuesday.        
	The existing network till Garia Bazar in the south will be extended to Garia station. Metro will then be extended to Dakshineswar, Barasat, Barrackpore, Garden Reach, Majherhat, Joka and Diamond Harbour before spreading to Hooghly and Howrah, the railway minister said at the inauguration of a computerised passenger reservation system (PRS) near Rabindra Sadan Metro station.        
	Whenever I travel I find people standing in long queues. Once the districts are linked with the Metro network these people will get some relief, the minister said.        
	The authorities have completed a survey of the Dum Dum-Biman Bandar suburban rail section and recommended its conversion to Metro. A study is also being conducted for the proposed extension of the Metro system to Majherhat, Joka, Budge Budge, Garden Reach and Diamond Harbour in the south.         
	Metro is also set to be extended to Barrackpore, Baranagar and Barasat in North 24-Parganas.        
	Mamata announced that an escalator would be installed at Jatin Das Park station. Since Chittaranjan National Cancer Research Institute is nearby, many critical patients use the station. They need an escalator, she said.        
	A centre for computerised PRS will be set up at the high court as well as lower courts.        
	Mamata claimed that the ministrys work was more important for her than party work. I took over the railway ministry in difficult times. Yet I am holding safety review meetings every fortnight. The party work is being looked after by my colleagues, she said.

                                                                                                               The Telegraph school awards for excellence 2009 
                                          
	The girl child was the theme at The Telegraph School Awards for Excellence 2009, presented by Techno India Group at the Science City auditorium on Saturday. They mould our lives as mothers, teachers and caregivers, said Barry O Brien, the convener of The Telegraph Education Foundation (TTEF). The ceremony began with a performance by students of Shaw Public School and members of Kolkata Sanved, an organisation that uses dance as an alternative therapy for the recovery and rehabilitation of victims of violence and trafficking, domestic workers and those suffering from HIV/AIDS.                    
	Neera Chopra walked out of her marriage with two little daughters after years of abuse and worked as a housekeeping assistant in Mumbai to make ends meet. Her younger daughter, Pooja Chopra, went on to become 2009 Miss India-World. The wonder mom gave away the certificates for TTEF Award for Courage. One of the recipients was Zubin Amit Seth of Bhawanipur Gujarati Education Society School, who battles severe disabilities in his lower limbs and hips and scored 93 per cent in his ICSE examinations.              
	The Dr Mrs NB O Brien Memorial Lifetime Achievement Award was given to Bibhuti Bhushan Shee, 72, an educationist and social worker who has dedicated his life to the development of his village, Dantan in West Midnapore. A student of Dantan High School, Shee returned to his school as a teacher after completing his Bachelor of Training from David Hare College. He retired as assistant headmaster of the school. In his career of 37 years, Shee taught and guided hundreds of students and regularly organised eye check-up, blood donation and other medical camps. The man who would provide shelter to needy students at his home and pay for their education is uncomfortable being talked about. I am just doing my duty and I get pleasure from it. I dont want any recognition, said Shee.                  
	Ramakrishna Mission Boys Home, Rahara, won the School of the Year crown. The basic principle of education at the institution, which started off as an orphanage and primary school in 1944, is discipline, said headmaster Swami Ameyatmanandaji Maharaj. Here we dont just want to produce students with excellent theoretical knowledge, we want to produce students who can think for themselves and ask questions, he added.                  
	The ceremony brought together wildlife conservationist Prerna Singh Bindra and two boys who have lost their fathers to elephant attacks in the Dalma Wildlife sanctuary. Bindra gave away the Santosh Chandra Banerjee Memorial Scholarship to Mangal Kumbhakar of Class VII and Santosh Singh of Class VI. The scholarship aims to encourage forest dwellers such as these two boys, who strive hard to protect the rich diversity of Indian wildlife.                  
	Courageous youths who have battled disabilities were feted on Saturday. Rana Kar (picture left) is visually impaired and got 86.88 per cent in Madhyamik 2009. He qualified for the Summer Paralympics in Greece, but his father, who makes Rs 1,000 a month, couldnt afford the Rs 1.5 lakh needed to make the trip. But that hasnt dampened Ranas spirits and he practises swimming every day. Rana got the M.L. Dalmiya amp; Company Scholarship. Like him, Soumayadipta Kapat (picture right) , who is 75 per cent disabled, was a national swimming champion. He secured 76 per cent in ICSE this year. Kapat won a certificate of honour in the TTEF Award for Courage category.

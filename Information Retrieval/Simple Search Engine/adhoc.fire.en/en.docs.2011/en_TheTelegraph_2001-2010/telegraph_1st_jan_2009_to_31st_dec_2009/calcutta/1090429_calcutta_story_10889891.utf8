                                                                                                               Channel pack offer
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Direct-to-home satellite television service Dish TV launched genre-based channel packages in the city on Tuesday. Subscribers of the DTH service will now have the option of buying add-on packs comprising only sports channels or only regional channels. Currently, packages comprise pay channels of various kinds.        
	The add-on packs promise to cut down the cable bill since subscribers will only pay for the channels they want. Industry sources say other DTH players are likely to follow suit.         
	Dish TV has also reworked its three-tier channel packages. The tier-one pack will have Hindi entertainment, cinema and news. The next tier will have all the tier-one channels plus sports, kids and other entertainment channels. The tier-three pack will have English movie, business and lifestyle channels, said Anindya Sengupta, the deputy vice-president (sales) of Dish TV.

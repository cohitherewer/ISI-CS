                Sanjib Mridha, an undertrial at Alipore Central jail, could not be found on the premises on Tuesday evening. The youth was arrested recently in connection with a robbery and an arms racket. Whether Mridha has fled or not can be confirmed after searching the premises, said a jail official.     Transport operators on Tuesday stuck to their plan of going on an indefinite strike from Friday despite requests from the government.

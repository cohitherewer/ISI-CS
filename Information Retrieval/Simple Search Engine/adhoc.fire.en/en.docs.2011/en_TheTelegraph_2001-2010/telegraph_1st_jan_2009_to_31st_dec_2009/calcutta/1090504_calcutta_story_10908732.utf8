The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Play-in-plex experiment eyes the city stage
                                                                                                               Play-in-plex experiment eyes the city stage
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Mahabanoo Mody Kotwals stage adaptation of The Vagina Monologues, a top draw at the Fame plexes in Mumbai                                  
	A multiplex chain experimenting with stage shows in Mumbai to beat the Bollywood ban has decided to give Calcutta theatre a chance.        
	Calcutta is known for its keen interest in theatre and we are sure that a weekend evening show will run to packed houses, said Aditya Shroff, the associate vice-president (distribution and programming) of Fame Cinemas.        
	The plan is to turn the space in front of some screens at South City and Hiland Park into a performance area for the play-in-the-plex concept, replicating what Fame first did in Malad, Mumbai. The chain, which has tied up with the online stage directory Mumbai Theatre Guide to source Hindi and English plays, wants to get a regular activity going across all its plexes.        
	In Calcutta we are interested in Bangla theatre, which we will source through our local contacts. We are planning this initiative as a yearlong activity to be held at both Hiland Park and South City. While the Mumbai plans and dates are more or less in place, we are still in the planning stage as far as Calcutta is concerned, said Shroff.        
	The Bengali theatre community would rather wait and watch how the plex move goes. I dont know how theatre will fit into the multiplex-shopping mall culture. I have serious doubts if the multiplex clientele will at all be interested in Bengali theatre. It is also to be seen if the multiplexes will have the patience and willingness to put in the effort to help this movement stand on its feet, said Rudraprasad Sengupta of Nandikar.        
	Theatre actor-director Koushik Sen believes the exorbitant ticket rates  Rs 150-200  will come in the way of what could be a very interesting proposal. People in Calcutta shell out a maximum of Rs 60 for a theatre show. I dont think it will be a viable venture if the ticket rates are so high. But it might work if with sponsorship one comes up with stage productions exclusively for Fame. I see an enormous potential for childrens theatre in such a set-up.        
	The idea of playing at the plexes is an exciting one for GenX but not without a rider.        
	Actress-director Trina Nileena Banerjee fears catering to a multiplex crowd may compromise artistic quality. Its a great idea but I think the multiplex audience will expect a different kind of play than the Academy of Fine Arts crowd. And it wont be good if their expectations tell on the production.... The project will be sustainable only if we can strike a balance between the commercial aspect and the artistic quality.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Pritish Gupta, a Class XII student of Scottish Church Collegiate School, was found hanging from the ceiling of his Maniktala house on Wednesday afternoon.        
	A preliminary investigation suggested the 17-year-old was suffering from depression and had committed suicide. No suicide note was found.        
	Pritish was the only child of his parents. His mother became unconscious after seeing the body and had to be admitted to hospital. Pritishs father Parthasarathi is an engineer.

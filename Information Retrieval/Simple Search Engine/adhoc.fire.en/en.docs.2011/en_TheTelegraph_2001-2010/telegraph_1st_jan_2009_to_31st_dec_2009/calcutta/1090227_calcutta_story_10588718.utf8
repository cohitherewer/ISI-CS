The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Lets give our lungs a chance
                                                                                                               Lets give our lungs a chance
										      TT for City - Save the Maidan                        
	The state governments move to grab the Maidan has sparked rare outrage among Calcuttans on the Net, at home and abroad. In the run-up to Subhas Chakrabortys durbar where he plans to decide what to do with the Maidan, our readers have flooded us with mails of hurt and anger.              
	This is shocking news. We cannot let a government, if not corrupt, definitely incompetent in matters of pollution take over the Maidan. Sadly we have an Opposition that has no concern for the betterment of the city. It is up to the people to protect our greens.

	I live abroad, but my heart bleeds every time someone tries to destroy the city of my birth. Mamata Banerjee has been opposing all the moves of the government, why is she silent now? Isnt protecting the Maidan for the citizens a cause good enough for her? Or is it that, for the first time, the governments agenda matches her own?        
	Chaitali Choudhury, Stockholm         
	Calcutta is one of the most polluted cities in the world now  all credit to the Left Front government, especially the transport department, the chief patron of katatel and polluting vehicles. Please everyone, we must prevent this government move at all cost. Otherwise what will we tell our next generation?

	The state government wants to kill Calcutta by stabbing its lungs. I am ashamed to be a Bengali.

	Can we have a referendum? We had have enough!

	I am a die-hard Calcuttan working outside Calcutta. Its time we woke up from our slumber and do something for the city before it is too late.        
	Simon Gomes        
	Calcutta thanks The Telegraph for this campaign. I am prepared to take to the streets.

	PLEASE.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              Kakoli and Uttam				                                 
	A 40-year-old constable, whose wife committed suicide on Tuesday, has been arrested on the charge of torturing her.        
	Uttam Chakraborty, a resident of Satyanarayantala in Bally, was arrested after his daughter lodged a complaint alleging that he regularly tortured her mother Kakoli.        
	Uttam was produced in the chief judicial magistrates court in Howrah and remanded in 14 days judicial custody.        
	Uttam married Kakoli 15 years back and has a 13-year-old daughter, Mousumi, and a six-year-old son, Utsav.        
	In her complaint, Mousumi said Uttam was an alcoholic and would regularly assault her and her mother and was irregular in reporting for duty.        
	On Monday, Uttam had returned home around 8pm and started beating Kakoli. The assault continued till midnight.        
	Around 2.30am, he allegedly threw Kakoli out of the house. She stood on the road outside the house, crying. Mousumi brought her back inside.        
	Mousumi said she fell asleep around dawn and when she woke up on Tuesday morning, her mother was missing. The student of Pallimangal Vidyamandir in Bally then went looking for her mother in the neighbourhood on her bicycle. She even went to Bally railway station but failed to find her. At Belanagar, a station on the Dankuni-Sealdah route, she spotted a body near the level crossing.        
	She immediately called up her mothers family in Gurap in Hooghly. After some of her relatives arrived, Mousumi identified her mothers body around 10.30am.         
	The police started an unnatural death case and sent the body for post-mortem. Officers said it appeared that Kakoli had jumped in front of a moving train. Her body was cremated late on Tuesday. On Wednesday morning, Mousumi lodged the complaint.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Letter stops landfill
                                                                                                               Letter stops landfill

	An anonymous complaint has saved a pond spread over 15 cottahs in Narayantala (West).        
	The letter to state fisheries minister Kironmoy Nanda last month led to a joint inquiry by officials of his department and Rajarhat-Gopalpur municipality. The officials later lodged a complaint with police to stop further landfill.         
	Officials of the municipality and the fisheries department found during a joint inspection that the pond was being filled up. Protecting the pond is vital not only for environmental reasons but also because it is the only source of water for dousing a fire in the locality, said Tapas Chatterjee, the chairman of Rajarhat-Gopalpur municipality.        
	The owner of the pond, Pasupati Nasker, who lives in the area, denied involvement in the landfill.        
	Residents alleged that a promoter in the area was getting the pond filled up to erect a multi-storeyed building. He is very influential but the pond is vital for our existence. So we, too, are keeping a watch, said a resident.        
	A municipality official who was part of the team that inspected the pond said nearly 150sq ft on the southern side had been filled up and a cottage built on it.        
	We have informed the owner of the pond about the violation and asked him to take immediate steps to restore the pond to its original form, added a fishery department official.        
	An important reason for the rapid decline of the underground water level in Calcutta is the filling up of water bodies, according to experts.

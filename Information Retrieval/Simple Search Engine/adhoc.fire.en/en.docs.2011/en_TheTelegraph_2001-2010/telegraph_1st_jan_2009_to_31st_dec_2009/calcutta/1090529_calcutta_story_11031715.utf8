The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | In the dark, four days after storm
                                                                                                               In the dark, four days after storm
                            
	A family in South Garia        
	When did it go: 5pm, Monday        
	Status: Yet to be restored        
	Main problems faced: More than 15 flats in the building have run out of water. My daughter has not gone to office for the past three days. We are worse off than animals, said a member.        
	Who do they blame: The chief minister, CESC and local party workers who are threatening us with dire consequences if we speak up.              
	Raja Mukherjee, Regent Park        
	When did it go: 3pm, Monday        
	Status: Yet to be restored        
	Main problems faced: We are being forced to do without water. My two children, aged seven and four years, have slipped into depression.        
	Who do they blame: CESC, who else? The authorities are justifying their incompetence by claiming to be under-staffed or saying that uprooted trees were hampering their work. The utility is ill-prepared for any emergency.              
	T.R. Roy, Netaji Nagar        
	When did it go: Afternoon, Monday        
	Status: Not yet restored        
	Main problems faced: No water since Monday. Me and my wife are 60-plus. We have not been able to sleep properly for the past four nights.         
	Who do they blame: CESC. The personnel are inefficient and ill-prepared. Imagine what would have been the situation had the cyclone passed through the city.              
	Sumanta Chowdhury, Narendrapur        
	When did it go: Noon, Monday        
	Main problems faced: No water as the pump could not be operated. The estate generator, used to draw water from the underground reservoir, could not be operated for more than three hours at a stretch. I had to go to a neighbourhood club for a shower. Could not watch the Manchester United-Barcelona match on Wednesday night.        
	When did it return: 12.30am, Thursday        
	Who do they blame: Primarily the mayor, whose duty is to keep the disaster-management unit battle-ready.               
	Mahasweta Roy Chowdhury, Garia        
	When did it go: 11am, Monday        
	Main problems faced: We were harassed by CESC. The utility did not send its men till Wednesday afternoon. The municipality provided us water but that was unfit for use.        
	When did it return: 5.30am, Thursday        
	Who do they blame: CESC. The utility claimed it was under-staffed. But what prevented them from hiring personnel.              
	Kallol Debnath, Panchasayar        
	When did it go: 1pm, Monday         
	Main problems faced: No electricity and water. The local authorities pleaded helplessness. A CESC van and four water tankers turned up only after residents blocked the Bypass on Thursday afternoon.         
	When did it return: 4pm, Thursday        
	Who do they blame: CESC. It lacked manpower. The local authorities were indifferent to our plight.

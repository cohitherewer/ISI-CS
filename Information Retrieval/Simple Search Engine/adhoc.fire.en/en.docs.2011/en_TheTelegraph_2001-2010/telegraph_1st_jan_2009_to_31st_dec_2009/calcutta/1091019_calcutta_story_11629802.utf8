                                                                                                               A strict but loving teacher
          A STAFF REPORTER                           Swami Asaktananda                                  
	Swami Asaktanandaji Maharaj, the secretary of Ramakrishna Mission Ashrama, Narendrapur, died at a city nursing home early on Sunday.        
	The 78-year-old monk, who steered the ashrama for 33 years, was admitted to Belle Vue Clinic on October 11 with cardiac ailments. The end came at 5.30am on Sunday.        
	Swami Asaktanandaji was born Bishnupada Chakraborty on June 14, 1931, at Pahelgaon village in Sylhet district, now in Bangladesh. A science graduate from Calcutta University, he joined the Ramakrishna order after receiving diksha (initiation) from Swami Shankaranandaji Maharaj.        
	In 1962, he was ordained a monk and christened Asaktananda by the then president of the order, Swami Vishuddhanandaji Maharaj.        
	The swami, then known as Brahmachari Amarchaitanya, joined the school at the Narendrapur Ashrama in 1958 as its first headmaster. He took over as secretary in 1976.        
	In between, he had served as treasurer of the institution and spent 10 years at the Southern California Vedanta Society and other US chapters of the Mission.        
	Many of the dream projects of the Narendrapur Ashrama  such as Blind Boys Academy, Lok Sikshya Parishad and a host of charitable programmes  flourished during his tenure as secretary, said former parliamentarian Basudeb Burman, who was the swamis junior at the Missions Pathuriaghata centre that was later relocated to Narendrapur.        
	The present headmaster of the school, Swami Satyatmananda, told Metro: The greatness of Asaktanandaji Maharaj lay in his humane nature. He was a very popular teacher, called Bishnuda by his students, and an able administrator.        
	People from all sections of society, cutting across all age groups, assembled at the ashrama on Sunday afternoon to pay their last respects to the monk. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti had sent wreaths.        
	High court lawyer Montu Ranjan Das, and retired railway engineer Jahar Lal Roy  both joined the Narendrapur school in Class IX in its first year  remembered the swami as a strict but loving teacher of life science.        
	Many students of the ashrama school were in the queue to pay their homage to the departed monk. Sankhyadip Baul, a student of Class VIII, recalled: I was very nervous the first time I met him. I was in Class IV then. But he made me feel comfortable by giving me a toffee.        
	Saira Bewa, a resident of of Ukila Majherpara village, close to the ashrama, said: Dadu (Asaktanandaji) used to send people to our house to enquire after our needs and get them for us.         
	The monks mortal remains were consigned to flames at Belur Math on Sunday evening.

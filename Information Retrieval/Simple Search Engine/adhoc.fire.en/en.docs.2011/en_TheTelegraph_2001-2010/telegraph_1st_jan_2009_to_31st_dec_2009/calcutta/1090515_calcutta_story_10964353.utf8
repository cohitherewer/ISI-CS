The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A vote veteran and two firsts
                                                                                                               A vote veteran and two firsts
          
	Metro chatted with a cross section of city voters. Three more from the ballot brigade:                 
	ARINDAM SIL
  actor        
	What did you wear?        
	Jeans and a white kurta.         
	Are you a regular?        
	Yes, Ive never missed.        
	Why do you vote?        
	To exercise my democratic right and also because I am a strong supporter of a party.        
	How long were you in line?        
	Not even 10 minutes.        
	What was the security arrangement like?        
	Brilliant. I had to show my ID card at least 100 yards from the booth. The paramilitary personnel were very efficient.        
	Did anyone ask for your autograph?        
	No, but people asked me what my next film was.        
	How did you spend the rest of the day?        
	Oh, it was like Durga puja. I met up with friends; we had great food.              
	SAHANA GHOSE
  22, student, resident of Ho Chi Minh Sarani        
	Why havent you voted before?         
	I was late in applying for my voter ID card.         
	Why vote this time?        
	Now that I have my ID card, there is no reason why I should not exercise my right.        
	How long were you in line?        
	A couple of minutes.        
	What was the security arrangement like?        
	Good. Since my polling booth was at my former school, La Martiniere, I wanted to wander around, but the cops were strict and asked me to leave.        
	Did you face any problem?        
	My grandfather was upset as his name was not on the electoral list.         
	Do you want any changes in the voting process?        
	I was a bit confused because a friend had said there was an option of blank vote, but I couldnt see it on the EVM. Plus, people were too casual.         
	Was there anybody at hand to help a first-time voter?        
	It was easy enough to understand, so I didnt need help.        
	What was the mood like?         
	It was kind of laid-back, it wasnt scary. I was expecting a bigger crowd.        
	A funny comment you heard standing in queue?        
	No, but some of the symbols of candidates were amusing  a kite, torch and even a banana!        
	Will you vote again?        
	Yes, I will.               
	MARINETTE LEONG
  18, student, resident of CIT Road        
	Why havent you voted before?         
	I turned 18 recently.        
	Why vote this time?        
	Because its the duty of every citizen.        
	How long were you in line?        
	Ten minutes.        
	What was the security arrangement like?        
	I saw a lot of paramilitary personnel and police. I felt quite safe.        
	Do you want any changes in the voting process?        
	Everything was a little slow. Plus, I think there should be separate queues for men and women.         
	Was there anybody at hand to help a first-time voter?        
	The procedure was simple so I dont think its necessary.        
	What was the mood like?         
	I expected people to be more serious, I thought we wouldnt be allowed to talk to each other, like in an exam hall, but everything was normal.         
	Will you vote again?        
	Yes.

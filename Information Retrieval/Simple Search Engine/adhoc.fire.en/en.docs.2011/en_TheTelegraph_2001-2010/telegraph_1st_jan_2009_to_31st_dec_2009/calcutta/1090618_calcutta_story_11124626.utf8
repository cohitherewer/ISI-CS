	The CPM used the cover of The Division Bell of Pink Floyd as part of its poll campaign (picture right). Compliments notwithstanding, it is sheer plagiarism to lift someones work without proper acknowledgement (Red goes pink (Floyd) April 14).           
	But plagiarism is something the Left is genetically inclined towards, without ever feeling that it is immoral or unethical to enjoy someone elses fruits of labour without paying for it.           
	It was a Left minister who took up the cudgels on behalf of a Durga puja committee in Salt Lake, which had copied elements from the Harry Potter books in the pandal. But then, the Left parties in our country can hardly be blamed. Their icon, China, has scant regard for intellectual property rights. The Left parties of India are just following in their footsteps.           
	Chameli Pal,
  Batanagar                                 Pavement peril: A tree uprooted during the May 25 storm in the city. A Telegraph picture      
	It was great to see an article on behalf of the NGO PUBLIC that addressed the reasons behind the felling of about 1,800 trees when cyclone Aila brushed past Calcutta (Why trees fall and why they dont, May 27). This is an important aspect of the present environmental drive in other parts of the world, though it is somewhat ignored here.             
	I would like to suggest a few ways by which urban trees could be kept healthier. There should at least be a 4-5ft radius of soil or soft paving at the base of large tree trunks. If the sidewalk is too narrow for a wide soil bed, then a gravel bed could be used, which allows more water trapping and less compaction. If neither is possible, the soil should be manually or mechanically tilled from time to time and should be protected with a low height (1ft) metal tree grate (as commonly used in New York).           
	Where none of these options is possible, a new method of retaining moisture, devised in California, may be used. In this method, hydrogel (a compound which swells after absorbing moisture) is mixed with the soil. This has shown to remarkably increase the depth of tree roots.           
	Another alternative is to have more trees where there is already an established bed of good soil structure. This would mean planting along the canals and waterways, in city parks and new multi-use development sites.

	I live in the US but my family lives in Narendrapur. I called them every day after the May 26 storm; I was very lucky that at least the phone lines were working at my home. It is a shame that the government could not even provide clean and safe drinking water to those affected by the storm. How much money and resource does it require to get some basic necessities to the masses?             
	Im not sure what needs to be done to cleanse the system. All politicians seem hungry for power but think little about the people. Im sorry to say that we still live in a Third World country. Not much has changed since Independence.

	Calcutta plunged into darkness after the storm on May 25 and many pockets continued without power for 90 hours. This has exposed the callous indifference of the city authorities. There is neither any disaster management planning nor any no co-ordination among the government departments. Also, CESC is prompt in increasing power tariff under various pretexts but hardly any steps are taken for maintenance or upgrade of their large overhead distribution system, especially in the suburbs.

	The problem of restoration of power after a cyclone or severe storm hits a city is understandable. But why should a metropolis have so many of pockets with bare overhead electricity lines? Compared to Jodhpur Park, Lake Gardens, Lake Town, Kasba, Behala and the fringe areas of the city  predominantly served by overhead lines on poles  the areas served by underground cables were better-off after the storm.           
	Cant CESC convert the supply lines to underground cables, of course with financial assistance from the state or central governments? I believe funds from the Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Renewal Scheme are available for such projects.

	The initiative of voluntary organisations and youths, including schoolchildren, to make the city clean and green by removing garbage from important parks is really commendable.             
	Instead of depending on the whims of civic workers, these youths believe in the ethic: Do it yourself (DIY mission for clean city, April 4).           
	It is the duty of the civic authorities to keep the city clean but garbage remains scattered all over the city. The people are however, also to be blamed for this. People need to be made aware about maintaining cleanliness in their neighbourhoods. If the youth take up the work of cleaning the parks, our city will be relieved of garbage. Schoolchildren and youths who play in different parks, including the Maidan, should join hands in cleaning the greens periodically. Schools may also arrange to involve their pupils in cleaning up nearby parks.

	Aila had one positive outcome as far as the massive metal billboards in the city are concerned. They are not only visual pollutants but hazardous too. Such hoardings should have been banned a long time ago in the city. (Aila forces ban on metal billboards, May 27).

	Apropos Rule twirl over moustache right, April 1, it is amusing to learn that former flight steward Victor Joynath De lost his legal fight against Air India, which sacked him for sporting a handlebar moustache. Emperor Akbar is famous for his moustache. Martyr Chandra Sekhar Azads long moustache is still a matter of discussion at many intellectual gatherings.             
	Besides, many security personnel get allowances for sporting a thick and long moustache. Across the world, many people with long moustaches apply to the Guinness Book of Records as prospective world record holders. Given that long moustaches are becoming extinct, Victor Joynath De should not be sacked on a flimsy ground.

	Apropos Kidney lost to reclaim life, April 11, it is a matter of great concern that despite over 60 years of Independence, there is neither social security nor basic healthcare for our population. One only hopes the new government takes positive steps to help patients like Subrata Chanda.             
	A.S. Mehta,

	The report 7 years too few: wife, reveals the severe anger that Papia Bhattacharya feels towards husband Deepak, who mercilessly tortured their son Biswadeep and killed him during table tennis practice. Never will a woman seek rigorous punishment for her husband unless he is a cruel and barbaric man like Deepak.             
	B.N. Bose, 
  Dum Dum Park                   
	It is heartening that the police department and an NGO have undertaken a joint venture to ensure special protection for senior citizens of Calcutta (Police safety net for aged, April 11).             
	It is sad that many elderly persons in and around the city lead a desolate life. No one is there to stand by them in their time of need. The police can also stretch a helping hand to those aged persons who are abandoned by their families and are forced to take shelter under railway sheds or on pavements.           
	The cops should also intervene in those households where the elderly are ill-treated by their children and their spouses.

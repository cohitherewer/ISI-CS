                      Synergy through music and lyrics                    While Bob Dylans place in the pantheon of American musicians is cemented, there is one question that has confounded music and literary critics for the entirety of his career: Should Bob Dylan be considered a songwriter or a poet? Dylan was asked the very same question at a press conference in 1965, to which he famously replied, I think of myself more as a song-and-dance man. Rabindranath Tagore, one of the greatest poet of all time, has composed many songs which suit the fine art of elocution. Trilogue, this evenings presentation, does not intend to offer poetic justice to these two icons who represent two very different eras. Instead, the mlange between their creations intends to explore their lyrical synergy. Thus Bob Dylans Dream finds a compassionate counterpart in Tagores Aami keboli swapono korechhi bapono. In this programme, actor Kamalika and media personality Sujoy Prosad Chatterjee evocate Dylans constant transit between romanticism and reality. Rabindrasangeet exponent Pramita Mallick presents Tagores tryst with poetry through songs. Concept and direction: Sujoy Prosad Chatterjee. Hosted by Oxford Bookstore.                  Event: Programme of music and poetry on the creations of Rabindranath Tagore and Bob Dylan When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Oxford Bookstore, Park Street

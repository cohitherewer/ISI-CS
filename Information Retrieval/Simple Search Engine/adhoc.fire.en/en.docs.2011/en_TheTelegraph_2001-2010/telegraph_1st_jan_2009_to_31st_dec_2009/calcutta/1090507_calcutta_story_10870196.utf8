The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Terror email taint dogs Salt Lake duo
                                                                                                               Terror email taint dogs Salt Lake duo
          PRONAB MONDAL                              
	Kaushik Basu and Sabitri Dandapat, who were allegedly behind an emailed bomb threat that sparked panic in the city last July, are still in the dock though the probe into the case has drawn a blank.        
	Calcutta police say they havent dropped the charges against the two, who are out on bail, because they are still waiting for experts opinion.        
	They were arrested because Kaushik is the owner of the cyber caf in Salt Lake from where the email was sent and Sabitri used to be in-charge of the unit. Other than this, we have not found any link of the two with the email, said an officer of the detective departments cyber crime cell.        
	This is the final stage of the probe. Once we receive a report from the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) stating that the two were not involved in the terror email episode, we will drop their names from the chargesheet, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner (detective department).        
	Kaushik and Sabitri had to spend more than two weeks behind bars before getting bail. They will again have to be present in court in June.        
	The investigators had sent the hard disks of seven computers seized from the cyber caf to the CFSL. We wanted to be sure. The experts at the CFSL can retrieve data deleted from the hard disks. But they have not yet contacted us, said Shamim.        
	A CFSL official said they were taking so long because hundreds of requests were pending with them. We are clearing our backlog and will definitely examine the hard disks once their turn comes. We hope to complete the work in a couple of months, he said.        
	The email to media houses on July 29, 2008, threatening serial explosions across the city from 10pm, resulted in deployment of 500 policemen. Kaushik was arrested the same day while Sabitri was rounded up the next day.        
	Police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti had said Kaushik sent the email and Sabitri knew about it. Our efficient officers showed their excellence and they traced out the cyber caf in Salt Lake within a few hours of receiving the mail, the top cop had said in a press conference at Lalbazar.        
	The cops had claimed that Kaushik had created an email ID under the assumed name Khalid Mohammad about five minutes before despatching the mail. After sending the email, which warned of blasts at 10pm, he allegedly tried to delete the email account. These findings turned out to be false.        
	The police later came to know that a youth carrying a pen drive had come to the cyber caf on July 29. The threat email was saved in the pen drive, said an officer. The youth is still at large.

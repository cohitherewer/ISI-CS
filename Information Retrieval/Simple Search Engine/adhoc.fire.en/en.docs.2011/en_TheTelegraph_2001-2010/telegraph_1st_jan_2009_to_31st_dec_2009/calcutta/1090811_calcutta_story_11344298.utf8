	A speeding truck rammed into an overloaded pool car, injuring the six girls who were going to school in it, at Gopalpur on Budge Budge Trunk Road on Monday.         
	Two of the girls were admitted to hospital. The driver of the Ambassador and a cyclist were also injured. The driver of the truck fled.        
	The Ambassador was headed from Batanagar to St Teresas School in Kidderpore when the truck, moving in the opposite direction, hit it in an attempt to overtake a rickshaw, said witnesses.        
	The Ambassador went off the road and smashed into the railing of a nearby school compound, said Kali Dutta, who saw the mishap.        
	Residents and employees of the local school brought the children and the driver out of the car and took them to CMRI hospital. They also informed the childrens parents about the mishap.        
	Srija Dhar of Class VI and Anushka Ghosh of Class IV were admitted with fractures and other injuries.        
	Anushka may be operated on Tuesday. Srija had soft tissue surgery and will be operated on for fractures on Tuesday, said a doctor.        
	I was sitting behind the driver and reading a book. Suddenly there was a loud noise. My head banged against something and everything went dark, said Anushka from the hospital bed.        
	The other four girls were released after treatment. The right hand of the pool car driver was fractured. The truck suddenly swerved right and crashed into my vehicle, he said.        
	We are looking for the truck driver, who fled immediately after the mishap, said a police officer.

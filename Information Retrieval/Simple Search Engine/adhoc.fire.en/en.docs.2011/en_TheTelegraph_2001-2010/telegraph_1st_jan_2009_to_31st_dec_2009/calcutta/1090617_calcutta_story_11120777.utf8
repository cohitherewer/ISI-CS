          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Four crude bombs were found inside a polythene bag lying in a ditch near the Wipro building in Salt Lake Sector V on Tuesday afternoon.        
	Construction workers who spotted the bag took it to Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authoritys office at Unnayan Bhavan, near Karunamoyee. Authority chairman S.A. Ahmed immediately called up Bidhannagar East police station.        
	Bomb disposal squads of the police and the CID arrived and found four crude bombs inside. Around 5.30pm, the personnel took the bag to a vacant space beside the parking lot and defused the bombs.        
	Debabrata Das, the additional superintendent of police of Bidhannagar, said: The bombs were of low intensity and wet. A case has been started against unknown persons.        
	As word of the bombs spread, some people in the building panicked and rushed out. They slammed the police for not evacuating the building.

                      Icons of human excellence                    Life is a journey from the planes of dormant possibilities to the summit of fully-blossomed human excellence. It is not just idle loitering, but a concentrated surge ahead to complete and realise this tremendous journey. Self-conviction without arrogance is the hallmark of greatness. Rabindranath Tagore and Swami Vivekananda, certainly two of the most extraordinary Indian personalities of the 19th century, attracted world focus and became natural icons of human excellence through their supreme self-conviction and confidence. They restored the lost faith and pride of the country, became messiahs of love and peace through catholicity, with tolerance and acceptance as their central message. As a tribute to these two great personalities, Bhavna Records and Cassettes launches Uttoron: Biley Theke Vivekananda, Rabi Theke Rabindranath, a twin-CD audio-album based on the story of transcendence of Swami Vivekananda and Rabindranath Tagore through music and commentary. Providing glimpses of their struggle to unfold their genius, the collection offers valuable insight into the minds of both men, who were also philosophers and visionaries. Abhirup Guha Thakurta has rendered the Tagore songs in his naturally expressive voice. Swayambhu Mukherjee has wonderfully harmonised the text and songs. The text is comprehensive yet aesthetic and his reading style is a relief from the cliche, but with the power to touch the hearts of the audience. To mark the launch of Uttaran this evening, Abhirup Guha Thakurta will present a solo recital of Tagore songs.                    Event: Launch of audio CD Uttoron, with Tagore songs and narration of Tagore and Vivekanandas life and teachings When: Today at 6 pm Where: Vivekananda Hall, Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, Gol Park

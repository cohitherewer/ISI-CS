The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cracker FAQs
                                                                                                               Cracker FAQs
                            
	The cracker ban has of late become a farce in the city. On Diwali-eve, Metro turns the spotlight on noise norms and the lack of a cop drive to enforce them              
	What are the cracker norms and the penalties for violation?        
	The central noise rules (2000) ban all fireworks that create more than 125 decibel sound at 4 metre from the source. In Bengal, the ban is on all fireworks that produce more than 90 decibel sound at 5 metre from the source.        
	Violators can be fined up to Rs 1 lakh or prosecuted under the Environment Protection Act, 1986, which can lead to up to five years in jail.              
	From where are banned crackers brought to the city?        
	Most costly fireworks are smuggled in from Sivakasi in Tamil Nadu as well as Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh. The cheaper ones are sourced from various areas in South and North 24-Parganas.        
	How can fireworks affect our health?        
	The sound caused by bursting crackers can lead to loss of hearing, sudden rise in blood pressure and even cardiac arrest. Children can suffer from trauma and foetuses, too, can be affected.              
	What are the major violation spots?        
	Ballygunge, Ballygunge Circular Road, Gariahat, Regent Park, Behala, Jadavpur and Kasba in south Calcutta. In the north, the problem points are Dum Dum Park, Lake Town, Baguiati, Burrabazar and Jorasanko. Salt Lake, too, has been a consistent violator.              
	What does the administration do to tackle the menace?        
	Some routine arrests are made but that is hardly a deterrent for habitual offenders. The pollution control board has lost its earlier zeal to monitor violation. After 10pm, with the administration going to sleep, its free for all across the city.

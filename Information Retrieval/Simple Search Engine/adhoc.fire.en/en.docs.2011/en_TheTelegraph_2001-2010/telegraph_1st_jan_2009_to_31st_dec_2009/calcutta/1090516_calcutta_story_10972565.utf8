The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Whoever wins the day, hope dies for ailing amp; abandoned
                                                                                                               Whoever wins the day, hope dies for ailing amp; abandoned
          SANJAY MANDAL                                            
	For two nameless, naked men in their seventies lying diseased and disowned in a state-owned hospital for more than 48 hours, it doesnt matter who wins or loses Election 09 on Saturday.        
	One of the two men was brought to Medical College and Hospital by residents of Arpuli Lane, off College Street, on Sunday night after they found him on the road. He remained in the emergency observation ward without any food or treatment until Friday morning, when the hospital authorities shunted him out because they needed the bed for a registered patient.        
	Metro found the man, a bag of bones, lying outside the building without a stitch on his body late in the afternoon.        
	The other man, equally emaciated and with no clothes, was on the floor of the same ward, apparently having fallen off the bed. No doctor, nurse or ward boy so much as cast a glance at him.        
	Someone had dumped the man in front of the hospital gate. Police brought him in a couple of days back. I have been trying to get the emergency ward staff to attend to him and the other elderly person but nobody seems to have the time or the inclination to even put them on glucose drip, said Pranab Mukherjee, the social welfare officer of Medical College and Hospital.        
	Mukherjee had unofficially contacted a missionary-run private home for the destitute to request beds for the two elderly men but the authorities allegedly turned him down.        
	Neither man is able to speak, let alone get up and even go to the toilet. A patient who requested anonymity said he would have helped them if he could.        
	I am myself confined to a bed and feel so helpless. They havent eaten anything in days. I requested a member of the hospital staff to give the men some clothes and food but apparently nobody has time for the dying. I wont be surprised if they dont live to see the next sunrise.        
	Medical superintendent Anup Roy blamed the families and relatives of the two men for their plight. I am unaware that they are lying naked on the floor of this hospital without food and treatment for over 48 hours. But let me tell you that this is not the first time that old, infirm people have been dumped in the medical college campus by their family members, relatives or other people. It is a big problem for us given the acute shortage of beds, he added.        
	Medical College and Hospital has around 1,600 beds and receives requests for admission far exceeding its capacity.         
	But does that justify the treatment  or the lack of it  meted out to the two hapless men?        
	People like them basically need nutrition and some care to be back on their feet. But if we take them in, it will amount to denying treatment to patients who are critically ill and need to be admitted immediately, argued the superintendent.        
	Another doctor said patients like the two septuagenarians might occupy beds for months if they did not have families to take care of them. If that happens, how will we run the hospital? he asked.        
	But couldnt the hospital staff have provided the duo basic care like food, clothes and glucose on humanitarian grounds?         
	Silence.        
	According to social welfare officer Mukherjee, a government hospital can officially approach a private home to take in a patient it cannot accommodate only with a courts permission.         
	The city has a state-run home for elderly people requiring medical rehabilitation but admitting someone there is just as difficult as finding a bed at Medical College and Hospital.        
	A year ago, two injured youths were administered intravenous drip under a tree in the SSKM compound because the hospital didnt have empty beds and the authorities did not want a visiting medical council team to see them on the floor.        
	But then, when did the ailing and the abandoned figure on any political agenda?

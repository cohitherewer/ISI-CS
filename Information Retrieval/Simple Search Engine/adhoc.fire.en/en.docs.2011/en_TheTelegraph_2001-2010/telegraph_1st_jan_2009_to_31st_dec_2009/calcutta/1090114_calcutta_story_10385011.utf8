           Grim reminder: The Taj Mahal hotel during the terror siege. (AP)                           
	The report Groom held with heroin, November 26, about a young man who was about to be married in a few hours was caught by the police for taking drugs, exposes the social decadence of our times.           
	However, the decision taken by the bride not to marry the drug addict deserves accolades. She stuck to her stand in spite of requests from her family.           
	There are several laws to deal with such social menaces but hardly any are implemented properly for the eradication of these evils. Smoking in public places is now an offence, but many break the law with impunity. Due to lack of administrative surveillance, it is not uncommon to see people smoking in tram cars, buses and other public places without any hesitation or fear.           
	Awareness against drugs or tobacco cannot be ensured simply by displaying banners, hoardings or telecasting advertisements. The government must ban the sale of tobacco products altogether and crack down on the illegal sale of drugs.           
	VIPs, celebrities and politicians should come forward and set a precedent by giving up smoking so that the common people can be inspired to follow in their footsteps.

	What was earlier a pleasant welcome has turned grim at star hotels in the city, which have become fortresses after the Mumbai siege (Sniff amp; scan at jittery star hotels, November 28). The long battle with terrorists in Mumbai, which killed close to 200 people and injured many more, was brutal and shocking. The UN, along with prominent countries, must form a global commando force to combat terrorists. Terrorism ruins development and disturbs the peace of a country.

	Apropos the report Commandos for city streets, December 2, it is good news for Calcutta that the city police are going to form a quick reaction team that will specialise in combating terror strikes. The police should also upgrade their intelligence system so that they are able to nab criminals and terrorists before they can do any harm. Such a combat force should have been created a long time back. Hopefully, the deadly Mumbai attacks act as an eye-opener for the authorities.

	Calcutta is absolutely careless about safety. Only when terror hits another city is a security alert sounded in Calcutta, but that too for a brief period. Moreover, the security alert includes just a formal checking. In a city where police protection is meant mainly for ministers and meetings and michhils, one cant expect any safety measures.           
	Amrita Mallik, 
  Salt Lake           
	Apropos the report Fatal run to sons luggage, November 28, it is sad to learn that an elderly woman from Singur died in the Mumbai attacks. Given that terrorist attacks have become a global phenomenon, the whole world should come together on a common platform to tackle the menace.

	This is in reference to the statement made by artist Ganesh Haloi in the article Canvas crash, November 30. I strongly condemn his comment: Even those who were into advertising and commercial art had started to dabble in art. An artist of his stature and experience was not expected to reveal himself in such a demeaning light. By making such an irresponsible remark about commercial artists he has degraded the art fraternity. One would like to hear his appraisal of greats like OC Gangooly, Purnendu Pattrea and Satyajit Ray. What is the stature of Asit Poddar, Debabrata Chakrabarti, Anup Ray and Nirmalendu Mandal in Halois eyes? One wonders. This is artistic fascism at its worst.             
	Siddhartha Sengupta, 
  Monoharpukur Road             
	I enjoyed your story Romance wheels roll on, December 16, on the BMW motorbike in the film Saptapadi. NRIs like myself continue to feel the warmth of Calcutta by reading your online version.             
	Narayan Suraj Maitra,
  Auckland, New Zealand           
	I was disappointed to read that Uttam-Suchitra may not have ridden the bike at all in Saptapadi. Knowing that the most romantic scene of Bengali films may have been a fake robs it of its charm. I would have preferred not knowing this fact.

                                                                                                               ZooZoo, the rakhi rage
  - Crystal, kundan pop picks too           RANJABATI DAS                          Rakhis inspired by the Vodafone ad were sold out at Vardaan Market. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                                        
	Rakhi has an unintended beneficiary this year  Vodafone. ZooZoo, the black-and-white creature in the cellphone service providers ads, has found pride of place on rakhis for the August 5 festival.         
	Shells, beads and plaited dhagas have long sold along with Bollywood-inspired rakhis. Thats true this year, too, but this may be the first time that a character from the ad world has made the cut.        
	I was very surprised to see ZooZoo rakhis. People are trying to make the most of the ZooZoos popularity. We didnt expect it and we take it as a compliment, said Rajiv Rao, the executive creative director of O amp;M, the firm that created the campaign.         
	ZooZoo rakhis are all the rage among kids this year. Though they are priced at Rs 30, the stock was sold out. It is more popular than old favourites Batman and Spider-Man, said Sandhya Bader of Audio Track at Vardaan Market.        
	There are also Ghajini and Singh is Kinng rakhis, priced at Rs 30, as well as Shin Chan and Barbie rakhis. Then there are his n hers rakhis for, say a bhaiya and bhabhi (brother and sister-in-law), with tassels and ornate coins that would cost no less than Rs 300.        
	For those looking to go traditional, Burrabazar is flooded with threads and stones woven with sequins, zari and zardosi. The crystal rakhi is new, thats why it is such a craze, said Bimal Mehta, who has held fort for 40 years in the heart of the Rakhi Bazaar.        
	Mukesh Shaw, a shopkeeper in New Market, picks up his collection at Burrabazar. Apart from crystal pieces, the cheapest Rs 2 rakhis sell the most, he said. At Alipores Nandan Market, resham doris, embellished with a kundan centrepiece, were the pop pick.        
	And not every rakhi is meant for the brother either. We buy rakhis for Friendship Day and also for bhabhis and grandchildren, smiled Anindita Jain, busy rakhi shopping at AC Market.        
	If your brother is away, you could send him a rakhi kit. Packages containing a card and rakhi are priced between Rs 40 and Rs 75, while the Rakhi Thali that includes a coconut, a box of tika, chawal and rakhi costs up to Rs 300, says Manish Manpuria, the proprietor of Archies Gallery at Forum, Elgin Road.        
	You could also visit websites like www.onlinegiftsportal.com, www.sendrakhigiftstoindia.com, www.onlinerakhistore.com or www.rakhimela.com. Some of these stock return gifts, too.        
	Also making the most of the festive buy-buy spurt, Blue Dart-DHL is offering discounts for courier packages less than 500 g till August 10.

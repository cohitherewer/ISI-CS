The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Man robbed of 2 lakh 
                                                                                                               Man robbed of 2 lakh 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two motorcycle-borne youths snatched a bag containing Rs 2.25 lakh from an employee of a private firm on Prince Anwar Shah Road on Monday morning.        
	Police said the incident occurred around 10.15am near Navina cinema when Shyamalendu Mondal, 35, was walking down the road after withdrawing the money from a private bank nearby.        
	Mondal is an employee of a transport company in Tiljala. As he was walking along the road, one of the duo who was riding pillion snatched the bag and the motorcycle sped away, said Supratim Sarkar, the deputy commissioner of police (south).        
	The duo were possibly following Mondal for some time. It appears to be the handiwork of a local gang, said an officer investigating the case.        
	Cops from Charu Market police station inspected the spot and visited the bank to find out the details of Mondals transaction.         
	Officials of the bank from where Mondal withdrew the money and local residents blamed lack of policing for the incident. There are several banks in the area. This is the festive season and the number of transactions is high. The police must intensify patrolling here, said a bank official.        
	Its such a busy stretch but there were no cops around, complained Atanu Mukherjee, a local resident.         
	A senior officer at Lalbazar said the local police station had been asked to name the cops who were on patrol duty on that stretch at the time of the snatching. Action will be taken against the officers if they are found guilty of dereliction of duty, he added.

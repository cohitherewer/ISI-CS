                Two persons were killed and four others, including two children, critically injured after the autorickshaw they were travelling in collided with a truck on Bijoygarh Road, under Mandirbazar police station in South 24-Parganas, on Tuesday morning. Police said Asadul Halder, 26, died on the way to a local hospital. A woman, who could not be identified, died on the spot.     One more person injured in the collision between a Gadiara-bound bus and a truck on National Highway 6 in Bagnan on Sunday evening died at SSKM Hospital on Tuesday, taking the toll to 23. Family members of the 39-year-old truck driver identified his body at Uluberia Sub-divisional Hospital during the day.     Sandhya Sengupta, 50, was critically injured after a pool car carrying seven students knocked her down on RN Guha Road in Dum Dum on Tuesday morning. She was admitted to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital with severe waist and head injuries. Residents intercepted the pool car but the driver fled. After sending the kids to school along with a guardian, residents set the car on fire.    The body of Sheikh Selim, a 24-year-old resident of Sarat Chatterjee Road in Shibpur, Howrah, was found lying in a pool of blood near the boundary wall of Gestkins Willams factory in Shalimar on Tuesday evening. Police said Selim was wanted in connection with several cases of theft. Preliminary investigation indicated that he was shot in the chest. Police have sent the body for post-mortem.    The state government on Tuesday resolved to start the construction of the citys biggest multi-tier parking lot near City Centre in Salt Lake to meet the projected rise in vehicle count once the East-West Metro becomes operational. Residents have opposed the construction of the parking lot. At a review meeting with police and CMDA officials, urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said the proposed parking lot was a must for Salt Lake but did not set a date for starting the Rs 50-crore project. The minister also formally awarded the contract for construction of the Parama Island-Park Circus flyover to HCC. Bhattacharya announced that the flyover in front of Wipro would be inaugurated on January 4 next year.     Power supply might be disrupted in Howrahs Pilkhana, Dobson Road, Abani Dutta Road, MC Ghosh Road, Tikiapara, Sri Kissen Vakat Lane, Belilious Road, Belilious Lane, Panchanantala, Kshetra Mitra Lane and Salkia between 9.30am and 11am and 3pm and 4pm on Wednesday for maintenance work.     The additional chief judicial magistrates court in Salt Lake cancelled the bail plea of Suprakash Banerjee, the managing director of the dud IT firm Re-Life Digital Solution Pvt Ltd, on Tuesday and remanded him in judicial custody till December 29. Banerjee was arrested last week for allegedly duping Rs 20 lakh off 80-odd trainees.    Jagadish Nayek, the 40-year-old alleged leader of a cheque fraud racket, was arrested in his Howrah residence on Monday night. A complaint was lodged last year stating that Nayek and three others had stolen account payee cheques for Rs 80,000 from a drop box in an ATM and encashed them by opening an account of the same name.

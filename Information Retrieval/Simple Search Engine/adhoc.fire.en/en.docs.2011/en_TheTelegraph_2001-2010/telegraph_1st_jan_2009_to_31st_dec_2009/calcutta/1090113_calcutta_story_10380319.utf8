                                                                                                               Mystery of missing patient
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Raghunath Rajak, the patient who went missing from SSKM Hospital on Saturday, was not traced till late on Monday.        
	The family members of the 45-year-old lodged a complaint with the hospital authorities on Monday. They demonstrated outside the office of the medical superintendent demanding action against Group D employee Bhim Chowdhury, who had allegedly deserted Raghunath inside the hospital complex instead of accompanying him to his bed.        
	The family filed an FIR with Bhowanipore police station against Chowdhury, alleging negligence.        
	We submitted a complaint to the hospital superintendent stating instances of negligence on the part of the hospital and the Group D worker who deserted my father on the premises, said Raghunaths son Dipak.        
	Raghunath was admitted to the hospital on Wednesday with hernia in his right leg. On Saturday morning, Chowdhury allegedly asked for Rs 50 from Dipak to escort his father to his bed in Curzon Ward, in the Main Block, from the orthopaedic department, in the Woodburn Block, after tests.        
	Dipak agreed and left the hospital to deposit his fathers pus sample to a private diagnostic centre. When he returned, he could not find his father. Chowdhury denied any knowledge of Raghunath and fled.        
	The Group D worker, a resident of Titagarh, turned up at the hospital on Monday on being summoned by the authorities and the police. He claimed that he had left Raghunath on the ground floor of the Main Block and denied asking for a bribe.         
	Hospital superintendent Asoke Ghosh said Chowdhury, if found guilty, would be suspended or dismissed.

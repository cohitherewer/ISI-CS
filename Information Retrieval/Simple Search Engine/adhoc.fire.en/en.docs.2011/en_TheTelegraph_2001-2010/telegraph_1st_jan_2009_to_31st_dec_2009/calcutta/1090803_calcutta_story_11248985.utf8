The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Course in pain relief
                                                                                                               Course in pain relief

	A city-based institution, Daradia, has tied up with Aesculap Academy of Germany and started a programme in intervention techniques in pain management, using the latest methods, equipment and drugs.        
	There are about 10 pain management experts in Calcutta who use intervention techniques. The city needs at least 100 such doctors, said Goutam Das, a pain management expert at the Daradia clinic.        
	The programme aims to train doctors in dealing with slip discs, a common complaint, and the acute pain suffered by terminally ill patients, including those suffering from cancer.        
	A common technique in the treatment of slip discs is percutaneous nucletomy, in which a small probe is inserted near the affected disc and the leaked jelly between two discs is sucked out. The nerve root, thus, is no longer irritated, relieving the pain, said Das, explaining one of the intervention procedures.        
	Among the doctors attending the course are pain specialists Eltayeba Gadir of Khantum Hospital, Sudan, and Mohammad Rahman of Lutheran Medical Centre and Maimonides Medical Center in New York City.        
	Doctors from abroad attending the course were shocked to learn that leading cancer hospitals in Calcutta did not have facilities for intervention techniques in pain management. Daradia runs two courses, of two week and three months duration.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Branches block the way
                                                                                                               Branches block the way
        A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	The city continued to be in the grip of tree trauma a day after Cyclone Aila roared past. Metro visited various affected spots on Tuesday and found tram tracks and roads blocked by uprooted trees.        
	The first stop was the Hospital Road-Kidderpore Road crossing, in the Maidan area. The two trees that had fallen on the tram tracks on Monday afternoon were still there at 10.45am the next day. CTC personnel who were sawing off the branches said there was little chance of the tracks being cleared till Wednesday.        
	The situation at the second stop, in front of a western gate of National Library, was slightly better. A big tree crashed into the gate around 3.30pm on Monday, blocking National Library Avenue and damaging four vehicles. At 11.15am on Tuesday, the branches and the trunk were found dumped on one side of the road, allowing slow movement of vehicles in a single file along the other side.        
	On Russell Street, a huge tree had fallen on four cars, blocking the artery. The vehicles had been removed but the tree was still occupying three-fourth of the road on Tuesday afternoon. Cars were crawling through the remaining space.        
	A guava tree had keeled over in front of the British deputy high commission early on Monday and blocked Ho Chi Minh Sarani. At 11.45am on Tuesday, cars were seen plying through a narrow passageway cleared the night before, the sides scraping against the branches.        
	Lord Sinha Road at noon was out of bounds for motorists. Police had put up barricades at both ends after a tree in the Sakhawat Memorial School compound crashed into the boundary wall and blocked the road. A day later, the branches and debris were waiting to be removed.        
	On Gariahat Road, the tree that had fallen on a minibus in front of a CESC office on Monday afternoon was still blocking the artery. Pedestrians were ducking under the tree trunk, that was resting on a footpath railing.        
	The last stop was 101C Ballygunge Place, a five-storeyed house on which an uprooted tree had collapsed on Monday afternoon. The structure is intact but 40 window panes were shattered and the balcony grille damaged, said house-owner Sarojit Basu.        
	CMC officials said 700 trees had been removed till Tuesday afternoon. Fifteen teams, of 10 men each, are clearing the roads. We hope to remove all trees by Wednesday evening, said Debasis Chakraborty, the deputy chief engineer in charge of parks and gardens.        
	Deputy commissioner (headquarters) Jawed Shamim said the cops were trying their best to saw off the uprooted trees.        
	All 14 cranes of the traffic department have been pressed into service. But they are not enough. Weve asked realtors and other sources for cranes, said an officer at Lalbazar.

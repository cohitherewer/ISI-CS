The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Court deadline for clean water
                                                                                                               Court deadline for clean water
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	The high court on Friday gave the public health engineering department an ultimatum to file an action-taken report on supply of contaminant-free drinking water to the city.         
	The division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice B. Somadder said contempt notices would be issued against the officers concerned if the department did not file the report within four weeks.        
	Seven months ago, the court had directed the department to state in writing what action it had taken to supply contaminant-free drinking water to government hospitals and the headquarters of the civic body and police apart from a few other public places.         
	On Friday, the court took exception to an appeal for more time filed by the departments lawyer. If necessary we will call the chief minister to court, said the division bench setting the four-week deadline.         
	Green activist Subhash Dutta first brought the matter to the notice of the court in 2002. The lackadaisical attitude of the department was the main cause of anguish of the judges, said Dutta.        
	After testing 235 samples, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation had found that water supplied to government hospitals, the police and civic headquarters and other public buildings was not fit for human consumption.        
	The civic body had told the court that it had been supplying clean water, which was getting contaminated in the reservoirs as they were not cleaned properly.         
	Alok Ghosh, the lawyer representing the civic body, had said: My client does not have the authority to enter the premises and take measures to clean the reservoirs. Only the public health engineering department can take action in this regard and force the authorities of the buildings to do the job.        
	On the basis of the civic bodys submission, the division bench had asked the department to take action to prevent contamination of drinking water and file a report before the court.

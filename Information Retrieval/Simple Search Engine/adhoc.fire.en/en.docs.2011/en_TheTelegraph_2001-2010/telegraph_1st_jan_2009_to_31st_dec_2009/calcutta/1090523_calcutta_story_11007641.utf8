The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Two toppers minus tuition
                                                                                                               Two toppers minus tuition
  - National and city champs with 98 and 97.2 per cent          TAMAGHNA BANERJEE AND JHINUK MAZUMDAR                        Shubhasish Bhadra (top) and Subhanip Biswas on Friday. Pictures by Bishwarup Dutta and Aranya Sen				                                             
	Shubhasish Bhadra is a poet, a novelist, a national level debater and also the CBSE national topper for Class XII with 98 per cent marks.        
	Subhanip Biswas is hooked to computer games, the IPL, Sherlock Holmes and is also the CBSE city topper for Class XII with 97.2 per cent marks.        
	Neither took any private tuition and both spent hours in the virtual world.        
	Shubhasish, a non-resident Calcuttan, now studies in Delhi Public School, RK Puram, but was at his family home in Patuli on the day of the results.        
	The soft-spoken 17-year-olds scoreboard? Math 100, economics 99, chemistry 98, English 98 and physics 95. (The percentage that counts is English plus best four subjects.)        
	I believe private tuitions is a waste of time, especially when I had such wonderful guidance from my school, said Shubhasish. The Calcutta topper, from Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, also did not see the point of private tuitions. I followed what was taught in school and my mother always guided me, said Subhanip, 17, who never skipped his two hours of computer games even during the exams.        
	It is my source of relaxation and I prefer playing cricket and FIFA games on the computer, said the boy from Baguiati with a report card that read: chemistry 100, biology 100, math 97, English 93, physical education 96.        
	Sunipa Biswas, a physics graduate and a schoolteacher, was a proud mother on Friday with hours of hard work monitoring her sons progress paying off. My son is not in the habit of waking up early or staying up late, so I made sure that he studied consistently throughout the year.        
	Shubhasishs mother Banani Bhadra just couldnt stop smiling. We got the first call at 8am from his school principal. It was much later in the day that we realised he was perhaps the country topper, she said, feeding her son a pastry. Shubhasishs father Ashim Kumar Bhadra is an ex-captain of the Indian Navy.        
	The topper was busy in the quiz and debate circuit in Delhi till December 2008, after which he studied around six-seven hours a day to achieve results that were way beyond his expectations.        
	Shubhasish, like Subhanip, is often on the computer, playing online games or chatting on Facebook or Orkut. His inspiration to pen poems comes from Rabindranath Tagore, while in the cricket world he is a die-hard fan of the Kolkata Knight Riders.        
	The black-and-gold jersey unites the two toppers as Subhanip too is a KKR follower. I am now supporting Chennai Super Kings, shrugged the teenager who has no time for mindless adda or absurd books like Harry Potter. Give him a Dickens, a Victor Hugo, a Jawaharlal Nehru or the works of Satyajit Ray and Arthur Conan Doyle instead.        
	Subhanip wants to stay on in Calcutta, study chemistry honours in Presidency College and then become a scientist. Shubhasishs hopes of going abroad for higher studies have suffered a setback with rejections from seven of eight foreign universities. He is now setting his sights on studying economics at Delhi University, with distant dreams of Harvard University for macroeconomics or international trade. But after earning his spurs abroad, Shubhasish wants to make a difference in India. I am inspired by Mahatma Gandhi and want to enter politics through social service, said the topper, who picks Delhi chief minister Sheila Dixit as his favourite politician.

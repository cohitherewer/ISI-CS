	A symposium in the city will address a little-known facet of canine healthcare  diseases that humans pass on to dogs.        
	The national-level meet, highlighting recent advances in canine healthcare, has been organised by the faculty of veterinary and animal sciences at the West Bengal University of Animal and Fishery Sciences.        
	Titled Modern Look at Canine Health Care Management in the Global Perspective, the symposium is part of a three-day national congress on canine practices and the 6th convention of the Indian Society for Advancement of Canine Practices.        
	The meet, which will continue till Sunday, was inaugurated on Friday by society patron P.K. Uppal in the presence of K.M. Buzobarua, the deputy director-general of animal sciences at the Indian Council of Agriculture Research in New Delhi. It is time we put greater emphasis on proper control of diseases, including immunisation and treatment management, Uppal said.         
	We are aware of diseases that dogs pass on to humans but hardly know of diseases that can pass from humans to dogs, like tuberculosis. We will discuss these issues, said Arindam Samanta, a participant at the symposium.        
	It highlighted the special needs of pedigree dogs. Pedigree dogs should be treated by properly trained vets, said Dipak De, the dean of veterinary faculty of the university.         
	Society president S.K. Ray spoke about the trend of keeping pets in urban homes. Owners have become better informed about pet healthcare management.         
	The symposium will dwell on aspects of canine healthcare, from better feeding practices to breakthroughs in surgery. Leading scientists and veterinarians will present papers on immunology and vaccination, rabies, management of renal failure and epilepsy.

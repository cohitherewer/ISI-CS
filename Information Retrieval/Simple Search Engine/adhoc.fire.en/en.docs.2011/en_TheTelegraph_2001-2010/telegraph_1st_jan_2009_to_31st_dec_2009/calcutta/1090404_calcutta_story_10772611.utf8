	It was a hot afternoon, but for the children who sped by on roller skates, the heat was easy to disregard.         
	With smart skating shoes, helmet, knee and elbow guards in place, the spirited kids couldnt wait to show off their skills at the inter-school roller skating competition held at Sports Authority of India (SAI), Salt Lake, on March 22, 29 and 30.         
	An initiative of Zenith Roller Skating Academy, it had over 100 students, from the age of five to 12, competing for the best positions in speed and dance skating. The latter included classical, semi-classical and Bollywood dances performed on skates.         
	Children from 28 schools, including La Martiniere for Boys and Girls, South Point, Garden High and Nopany Vidyalaya, took part in the contest, which was organised for three age groups: five to seven, seven to 12 and 12 and above.         
	The aim of the competition is to prepare skaters here for national-level competitions, explained Madhuchhanda Mookerjee, who runs Zenith.         
	Students from her institute had won a gold, bronze and silver at the national-level roller skating championships in 2003 and 2007. The popularity is increasing every year. We started in 2000 with only five students and now we have more than 150, said Mookerjee.         
	On the evening of the prize distribution ceremony, 11-year-old Rupkatha Ganguly put up an Odissi performance on skates, along with Abrar Saqib of Garden High School.         
	St Thomas Boys School student Moinak Das came first in the seven-to-10 group in speed skating. Though he took a few rough falls, it didnt deter Moinak from getting back on the track. He was selected the best skater of the year.         
	Abrar came first in the 10-to-12 group in dance skating for his performance to the theme song of Fashion.         
	Abrar has even performed in reality dance show Dance Bangla Dance. Said Nurunnessa Begum, his mother: It was just a class in school at first. But as he enjoyed it so much, we want him to stick to it. We wouldnt mind him taking it up professionally in future.

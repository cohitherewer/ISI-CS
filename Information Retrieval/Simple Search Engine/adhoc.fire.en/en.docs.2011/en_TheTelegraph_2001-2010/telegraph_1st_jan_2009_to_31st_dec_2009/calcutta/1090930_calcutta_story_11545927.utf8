The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fantasy pandal bathed in fluorescent light
                                                                                                               Fantasy pandal bathed in fluorescent light
          RANJABATI DAS                          The puja of Park Cultural Association. (Sanat Kr Sinha)                                  
	Arijit Sett, Opashona Ghosh and Arka Alam wanted to give free rein to their creativity this Puja. So off they went to Park Circus armed with glow paint, ultra-violet lights and an untamed imagination to turn an otherwise staid pandal into a psychedelic riot of colours.        
	Engaged by the Park Cultural Association to design the pandal by the No. 4 bridge in Park Circus, the trio used idols painted pristine white and bathed them in chemical light.         
	As you walked down the simple blue and red structure with hand-painted symbols of peace and Om as the leitmotif, the colours gradually came into play. The garlands were yellow, and triangular lime-green units hung from the ceilings. The inner walls were in fluorescent shades of green, red and yellow, and ultra-violet rays projected from the dais lit up every little detail. The highlights were a pair of fluoro-yellow eyes and orange beads glowing in the dark.        
	But why call the pandal The Magic Wallrush 2.8 Chapter Neon?        
	Its a Magic Wallrush project, hence the name. We added the 2.8 bit because its neither an exhibition nor limited to art, explained Arijit, an English honours student at Jadavpur University and co-founder of The Magic Wallrush.        
	The motley group of youngsters had earlier staged Magic Wallrush 1 and 2, part of a series of art and photographic exhibitions.        
	Arijit, who initiated the pandal project, admitted it wasnt easy convincing the Park Cultural Association to grant licence to do whatever we liked. But once they got the green signal there was no looking back.        
	Apart from the core team, he invited other like-minded people to contribute to the project, including college mates Ishan Dasgupta and Md Amir Mondal. Amir is one of the artists whose work adorns the walls.        
	Committee member Tapan Kumar Paul said the ambience of the pandal first took everyone by surprise.         
	We envision Durga puja as a brightly lit festival, as opposed to Kali puja. So that aspect surprised us; otherwise we wanted the kids to do what they want, and we quite liked it, Paul said.

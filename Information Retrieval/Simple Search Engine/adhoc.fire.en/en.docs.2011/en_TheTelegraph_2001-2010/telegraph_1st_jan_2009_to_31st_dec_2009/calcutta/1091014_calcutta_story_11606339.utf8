The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Price no bar in buy-buy week   Gold soars to festive high 
                                                                                                               Price no bar in buy-buy week     Gold soars to festive high 
          POULOMI BANERJEE                           A Dhanteras buyer tries out gold bangles at a shop on Tuesday. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                        
	Gold is glittering more than ever this Dhanteras.        
	With the price of the yellow metal touching a record high  Rs 15,720 per 10gm for the 22-carat variety on Tuesday  and festive footfall rising steadily, jewellery shop stops in town are stirring back to life after a downturn-induced lull.        
	According to jewellers, buying trends indicate a gilt-edged Dhanteras-Diwali weekend despite the price of 22-carat gold  the metal of choice for traditional jewellery  increasing by Rs 920 per 10gm over the past fortnight.        
	Recession or price rise, I have to buy a precious metal on Dhanteras. If not gold, it must be silver, said Kakoli Ganguly, a resident of central Calcutta. For her its a festive buy, but for many others its an intelligent investment.        
	According to Bachraj Bamalwa of jewellery chain Nemichand Bamalwa amp; Sons, business may be buoyant in terms of value rather than volume this Dhanteras owing to the price hike.        
	The industry dipped by 10-15 per cent last year because of the downturn. But we expect to do 30 per cent more business this festive season despite higher prices, said Bamalwa, also the vice-chairman of the All India Gems and Jewellery Trade Federation.        
	Not only gold, even silver has become dearer by Rs 5,000 a kg  up from Rs 22,000 to Rs 27,000  over the past fortnight. Silver piggybacks on gold. So when the price of gold shoots up, so does the price of silver, explained Sanjiv Kejriwal of Gold Silver Arts.        
	Apurva Parekh of Mohanlal Madhawjee said he would have liked prices to remain steady in the run-up to Dhanteras. Last year was bad. Business is better this time, though I think it would have been more buoyant had prices not zoomed.         
	Some jewellers dont see rising prices as a deterrent. The buzz among customers is that gold prices will reach Rs 20,000 per 10gm. So if any prospective buyer has the money, he or she would want to purchase now, said Bablu De, the working president of the Swarno Shilpa Bachao Committee.         
	Many jewellers are making special offers to woo not only the Dhanteras crowd but the wedding shopper, too.        
	 A lot of shopping for the wedding season is done during this period. We are aiming for a 15-20 per cent increase in business, said Joydeep Sirkar of B. Sirkar Johuree.

	A Bihar resident was arrested in the New Market area late on Sunday for allegedly kidnapping two persons in Patna for ransom and killing them. The accused, Mohit Tiwari, has confessed to killing two of his victims and burying the bodies in a field near Patna, said Special Task Force (STF) officers who arrested him.        
	Bastab Baidya, the deputy commissioner of police (STF) said sleuths had information that Tiwari was in the city and would visit New Market on Sunday evening. He came at 10pm and was arrested. We recovered Rs 38,000 from his possession, said Baidya.        
	The city police alerted their counterparts in Patna and a police team from Bihar arrived in Calcutta on Monday to take Tiwari to Patna.         
	Tiwari told us he had killed a bank officers son in October 2008 and an employee of an agency engaged to refill ATMs, said an officer.

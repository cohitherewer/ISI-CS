The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Ravaged road trips convoy, commuter
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Ravaged road trips convoy, commuter
										      Street Hawk                        Gopalkrishna Gandhi				                           
	The governor on Tuesday morning had a taste of the problems commuters have been facing on the stretch between the Dunlop crossing and the approach to Vivekananda Setu for several months.        
	Gopalkrishna Gandhis convoy was stuck in a jam on the 500m stretch, known as PWD Road, for 15 minutes.        
	The condition of the road is pathetic and it was congested. The hooter was sounded but vehicles were blocking the path of the convoy. The police had to divert the governors car through Nivedita Setu and Vidyasagar Setu to reach Raj Bhavan, said an aide of Gandhi, who was returning to the city after a private visit to Belur Math.        
	We were clearing the road for smooth movement of the governors convoy. But both PWD Road and BT Road were choked at the time, said a senior officer of Baranagar police station.        
	Snarls are common on PWD Road, which hardly retains a trace of bitumen. The uneven surface, reckless driving by auto and the absence of policeman have turned the stretch into a death trap.               
	Repair lag                 Overloaded autos pose a mishap risk on PWD Road                 Craters reduce traffic to a crawl on the stretch        
	Vehicles of all sizes, from cycles to heavy trucks, ply on the road, which resembles a village path. There is a mishap almost every day because of the state of the road, said Sushanta Barui, who owns a shop in the area.         
	The construction of a flyover from the Vivekananda Road approach to BT Road has worsened the situation because a part of the carriageway has been blocked.        
	According to residents, vehicles now ply on the portion added to the road before the flyover construction started in March. About 350m on the Vivekananda Setu-bound flank of the flyover is in the worst condition.         
	The public works department, responsible for maintaining the road, blamed a water pipe under the road for its poor condition. Water used to leak from the pipe, affecting the surface, said a senior PWD official.         
	He added that Baranagar municipality had recently disconnected the line and repairs would be carried out on the road within seven days.         
	Three-wheel threat        
	The overloaded autorickshaws that ply between Ballykhal and Dakshineswar increase the risk of mishaps.        
	The three-wheelers can overturn any moment, given the condition of the road, said Arjun De, who regularly commutes on the stretch.         
	Autos moving towards Dakshineswar often ply on the opposite flank, causing snarls.         
	Traffic woes        
	Autos and vehicles dare to break rules because policemen are rarely present on the stretch.        
	Even during rush hours, motorists break traffic rules with impunity, said Jyotiska Das, who visits Bally often.         
	The slow movement of vehicles even affects the traffic at the Dunlop crossing. The queue of Dakshineswar and Bally-bound vehicles often reaches the Dunlop crossing, said a pedestrian.        
	Police version        
	An officer of North 24-Parganas traffic police cited lack of manpower as the reason why personnel are not deployed on PWD Road. We will look into a proposal to allow vehicles to reach Vivekananda Setu from BT Road through RN Tagore Road, he added.

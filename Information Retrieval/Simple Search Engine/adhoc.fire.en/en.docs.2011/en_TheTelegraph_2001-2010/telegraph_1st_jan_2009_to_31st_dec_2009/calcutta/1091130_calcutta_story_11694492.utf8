	nArtisans from Purulia have benefitted from tips on selling handicrafts from some of Indias best B-brains.        
	nWomen from the districts have started a cyber caf project with finance wizards teaching them how to maintain books.              
	Students of the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta, driven by the motto of helping those who help others, are trying to empower the underprivileged to get their lives back on track.        
	We have been working with NGOs on various issues. The aim is to help them sustain the projects with strategic and business tips that we learn at IIM, said Mohammad Ayub, the head of the Initiative for Community Action (Inca) cell, which has over 80 student members.        
	The cell has been working on strategies to reduce the number of school dropouts, hone marketing skills of village artisans and attract funds. We get over 250 applications from students every year, of which around 80 are selected. Teams are allotted projects depending on their areas of interest and expertise, said Ayub.        
	The Joka boys and girls have also included their social activities in the institutes annual calendar. This year, in the elimination round for IIM Calcuttas annual marketing-based event, Mandi, participants were asked to design campaign material for CRY (Child Rights and You) on the theme Is Education for All?        
	Participating teams had to submit ideas either through posters, videos or in PowerPoint format for advertisements to promote quality education among children, said Akhil Kulkarni, the vice-president of Census, which organised the event.

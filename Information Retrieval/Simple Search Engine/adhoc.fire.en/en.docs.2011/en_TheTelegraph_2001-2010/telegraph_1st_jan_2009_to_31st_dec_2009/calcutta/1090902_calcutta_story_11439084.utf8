	Calcutta High Court has stopped the screening of Poran Jai Joliya Re on grounds of plagiarism.        
	The division bench of Justice P.C. Ghosh and Justice I.P. Mukerji on Tuesday upheld the interim order passed by Justice Nadira Patheriya that the Tollywood potboiler produced by Shree Venkatesh Films was a lift from Vipul Shahs Bollywood biggie Namastey London.        
	Poran Jai..., starring Dev and Subhashree, cannot be screened from Friday, the court ordered on an appeal by Shree Venkatesh Films against Justice Patheriyas order.

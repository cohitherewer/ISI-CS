                                                                                                               Rooftop drama 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 45-year-old trader climbed atop a four-storey building in the Kasba Industrial Estate in Tiljala on Friday and threatened to commit suicide. Chandan Bhuniya, a cashew nut supplier, was brought down by fire brigade personnel after a six-hour drama.         
	The building belongs to the owner of a restaurant chain. Bhuniya has been our supplier for over five years. On Friday, he came with a delivery at 8.30am. An hour later he grabbed a bonti from our kitchen and climbed to the roof, said Rajib Neogi, one of the owners of the restaurant. Neogi said Bhuniya, who lives in a rented flat in Kalighat with his wife and two sons, started pelting people who had gathered below with pieces of brick.         
	As firemen struggled to bring him down, his wife reached the roof and managed to fling down the bonti. Bhuniya was overpowered and brought down, said an officer of Tiljala police station. Bhuniya told the cops the restaurant owners owed him lakhs of rupees and he had become desperate. The restaurant owners denied the claim. Bhuniya has been sent to hospital.

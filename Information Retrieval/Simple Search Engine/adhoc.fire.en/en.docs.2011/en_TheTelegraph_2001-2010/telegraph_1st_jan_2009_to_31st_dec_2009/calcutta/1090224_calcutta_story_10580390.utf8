The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | City last among equals in puff-ban compliance test 
                                                                                                               City last among equals in puff-ban compliance test 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta has puffed its way to last place among the four metros in terms of complying with the ban on smoking in public places, according to a study.        
	The survey by the Cancer Foundation of India, Calcutta, and the Healis-Sekhsaria Institute for Public Health, Mumbai, found the citys compliance record to be a mere seven per cent, against Mumbais 98 per cent. Chennai was second with 75 per cent and Delhi third with 56 per cent.        
	The puff ban took effect on October 2 last year, coinciding with Gandhi Jayanti.        
	As many as 93 per cent of the respondents in the city supported the ban but they agreed that compliance and enforcement were abysmally low, said Sutapa Biswas, the executive director of the Cancer Foundation of Indias Calcutta chapter.        
	The survey team had interviewed 1,026 people aged between 15 and 64 years in the four cities.        
	Biswas said the majority of the respondents blamed lax enforcement for the puff ban going up in smoke.        
	Health department officials admitted that the ban had not been enforced in the city. Lack of awareness and red tape are the two reasons why the ban has been a failure. Most government offices still dont have the challans that are to be issued to offenders, an official said.        
	The smallest no-smoking sign must be 60cm-by-30cm and the letters must be against a white background. The circular no-smoking sign in red should be accompanied by the words: No-smoking area  smoking here is an offence.        
	The board must also mention who can enforce the rules in a particular establishment, along with telephone numbers so that complaints can be lodged against offenders.        
	The rules stipulate that each offence will attract a fine of Rs 200. If officials deputed to enforce the rules fail to do so, they will be liable to pay fine equivalent to the number of individual offences.        
	Metro had recently published a report on how the ban on smoking in public has been a failure in public places like Calcutta High Court, Writers Buildings and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. Officials were caught puffing away on camera.         
	Whenever we make an effort to implement the ban in government offices, employees remove the no-smoking signs, a health department official said.         
	He admitted that the ban had been more effective in restaurants, bars and hotels.        
	We have not had ashtrays on our tables since the ban came into effect. There are signs all over the restaurant warning guests that smoking is an offence. But we cannot be rude to our customers. Sometimes we have to look the other way if a regular patron lights up, admitted a bar manager on Park Street.

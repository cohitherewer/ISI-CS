The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Duo held for credit card fraud
                                                                                                               Duo held for credit card fraud
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The detective department of the city police busted a credit card racket and arrested two persons on Thursday.        
	Mohammad Nasiruddin, 38, and Chinmoy Debnath, 25, have been charged with making money fraudulently by offering cash against credit cards to those in dire need of money. Seven swipe machines were seized from the duo.        
	Nasiruddin, a resident of Taltala, and Debnath, who lives in Kalyani, were arrested in their office on the 23rd floor of Chatterjee International. The duos confessions and documents found in their office suggest the racket started operation in 2007 and that they might have pocketed Rs 1 crore.        
	The two had opened an office  La Dorado  and placed advertisements in newspapers offering instant money against credit cards. For any amount they offered, the duo would keep four per cent as the transaction fee, said an officer.        
	An officer explained the modus operandi. Since there is a limit to the amount one can draw at a time from an ATM, the duo would swipe the credit card of a customer to show a fake transaction, ask the customer to sign the charge slip and rush to the bank to collect the money. They would then hand over the cash to the customer, keeping their cut.        
	This is in violation of the banking rules. We recovered a large number of charge slips, a register with details of every transaction carried out by the duo and forged tax invoice books, the officer added.

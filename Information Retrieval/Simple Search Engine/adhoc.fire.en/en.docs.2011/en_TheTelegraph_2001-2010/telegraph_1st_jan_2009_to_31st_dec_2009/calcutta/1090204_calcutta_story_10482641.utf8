                                                               Letters
                                   
	After terrorists struck Mumbai in November 2008, the custodians of Howrah bridge in Calcutta pulled up their socks and upgraded policing on the bridge by installing six state-of-the-art close-circuit television cameras.           
	But if the footage is not monitored properly, the very purpose of vigil will be defeated. A week after the 26/11 attacks, a school bag containing 8kg RDX was found lying in a corner of Mumbais VT station. Such laxity puts a question mark on the integrity of the security personnel on duty. There were CCTV cameras, but that didnt help ward off the threat.           
	Some months back, Metro had published a picture of a deserted monitoring cell of a Metro railway station, which is responsible for scanning CCTV footage. If such is the work culture, how will the newly installed, costly cameras help Howrah police avert a terror attack?           
	We will have to shed this lackadaisical attitude and put modern instruments like CCTV cameras to the best use in the interest of the nation.           
	Subhankar Mukherjee,
  Burdwan                       
	It is unfortunate that despite court directives, the Maidan was once again maimed by Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and his men (Back to court for maimed Maidan, December 22). The court must seek an explanation from the chief minister for violating its order since he was the master of the ceremony at the Maidan event. The army, which is the custodian of the greens, must also put a stop to mahamichhils immediately, or else the lungs of Calcutta will be choked forever.             
	A.S. Mehta,
  New Alipore           
	The DYFI meeting turned the Maidan into a garbage dump. Newspapers, plastic bags, empty cartons and water bottles were strewn all over. Food was cooked for the gathering and holes were dug in several places. Vehicles were parked on the Maidan, violating a high court order. The Maidan is the pride of Calcutta and we want it to be kept neat and clean. Henceforth, the army should not allow any mass meeting on the Maidan.           
	B. N. Bose, 
  Dum Dum Park           
	It is amazing that in spite of a court order the DYFI dared to use the Maidan for a rally, causing acute damage to the greens. Calcutta Book Fair was denied permission to be held on the Maidan for the sake of the citys health, but such rallies show that there is no rule of law in our land.           
	Ratan Kumar Halder, 
  Behala           
	If the Maidan cannot be used for rallies, parking cars or hosting soirees, why should it be used for playing golf? If digging up holes for rallies is condemned, why allow holes for golf? (Fairway falls foul of marauders. December 23). The state is under no obligation to fund the luxury of some snobs by protecting the greens for a pittance.           
	Playing golf is a career option, an entertainment or a social event. For all three, the user must cough up charges. Let golf courses come up as commercial ventures, where golfers pay and play. In a market-driven economy, there cannot be any free lunches.           
	Tapan Pal, 
  Batanagar                     A visitor feeds an animal at the city zoo despite a ban                   
	Apropos the report Chimp missiles injure zoo visitors, December 15, it is shocking to learn that two visitors were wounded at Alipore zoo by stones thrown by a chimpanzee in retaliation. Visitors teasing zoo animals should be arrested.             
	Prahlad Agarwala,
  Majdia, Nadia                       
	Apropos Man adopts 81-year-old, December 23, Dipak Kundu has not only upheld our values but also taught a lesson to the selfish family that abandoned the octogenarian.             
	Amaresh Paul, 
  Bandel           
	These days, children abandon aged parents, injured persons lie by the road as people walk by, even cops take their time to attend to accident victims. But true to Calcuttas charmingly contradictory character, there are also people like Dipak Kundu.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Govt to miss reform bus 
                                                                                                               Govt to miss reform bus

	The transport department looks set to miss its much-touted reform bus.        
	Two big-ticket plans of the department  getting old buses replaced by new ones and abolishing the commission system of payment for drivers and conductors  have all but hit a dead end with the authorities not sure of how to change the old order.        
	Transport minister Ranajit Kundu had on October 7 declared that applications for the replacement of vehicles more than 15 years old, which were to have been phased out by July 31, must be submitted by the end of the month.        
	With 10 days to go for the October 31 deadline, the public vehicles department has received applications for replacement of around 1,000 of the 3,067 buses and minibuses in the city.        
	The transport department, under pressure following its failure to get most operators to comply with the order, has started talking tough but again with nothing specific about it.        
	The government is serious about the deadline. We are drafting a showcause notice for those who will not meet it. Action will be taken against defaulters, transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury said on Thursday.        
	Minister Kundu had made a similar assertion on October 7, when he ruled out any extension of the deadline or consideration for whose who would fail to meet it.        
	In the two weeks since the ministers announcement, only 530 applications have reached his department.        
	Its unrealistic to assume that in another 10 days all the remaining operators would apply for the switch.... Apart from a few new buses bought with central funds, the government has nothing to show to prove its commitment to the green cause, said an official.        
	Not just phasing out of old vehicles, the government is also dragging its feet in abolishing the commission system of payment which it thinks is responsible for rash driving leading to fatal mishaps.        
	In July, then transport minister Subhas Chakraborty had vowed to put an end to the practice by December. A panel led by then chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb was set up to suggest an alternative system.        
	Three months have passed but Deb is yet to hear from the government on the issue. The project seems to have been dropped, Deb told Metro.        
	Under the commission system, a driver gets 11-12 per cent of the proceeds from daily ticket sales, while conductors and helpers get 6 and 2 per cent, respectively.        
	The incentives are legitimate but since there is no attempt to train the drivers and conductors, they tend to violate road rules and pack the bus with as many passengers as possible, said an official.

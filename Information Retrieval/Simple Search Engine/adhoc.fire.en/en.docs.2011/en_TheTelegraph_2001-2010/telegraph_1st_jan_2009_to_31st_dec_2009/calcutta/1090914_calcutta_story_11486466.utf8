The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CU in a fix over admission
                                                                                                               CU in a fix over admission
  - 10 Xaviers students to stretch varsity facilities, fear teachers          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	The Calcutta University authorities are in a fix over the high court order to admit 10 students from St Xaviers College to postgraduate courses by September 16.        
	University sources said classes in the new session had begun a month ago and there was no vacant seat in any of the postgraduate courses.        
	The authorities have asserted that the court order would be carried out but a section of teachers and officials fears that taking in the students without upgrading the infrastructure, especially laboratory facilities, would hurt the students.        
	We have not yet got a copy of the order but we will act as directed by the court, said pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs) Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee.        
	The court had on Friday ordered the university to admit Suraj Konar and nine other students from the Park Street college who had alleged that they were being denied berths on the basis of discriminatory admission criteria for candidates from affiliates-turned autonomous institutions.         
	The first batch from St Xaviers since it was granted autonomy in 2006 graduated this year.        
	The petitioners had sought admission in physics, chemistry, mathematics and computer science.        
	It is difficult to increase the intake of students for a science subject all of a sudden. The teaching standard is bound to decline if we admit more students than the sanctioned strength, a teacher of the universitys Rajabazar Science College said.        
	Before increasing the student intake in any science subject, the university is required to upgrade the laboratory infrastructure, appoint more teachers and buy more computers. There is little time to do that as the high court order is to be implemented by Wednesday. The university should have anticipated the problems before adopting the admission policy for Xaviers students, said another teacher.        
	The authorities also fear that the ruling would prompt other students from Xaviers who were denied admission by the university to move court.        
	The university this year admitted graduates from St Xaviers following normalisation of the marks they had scored in the undergraduate exams. Normalisation was aimed at achieving a parity between marks scored by students from the autonomous colleges and the affiliates.        
	Students from the affiliated colleges are admitted either on the basis of their rank in the admission test or marks in the undergraduate exams.

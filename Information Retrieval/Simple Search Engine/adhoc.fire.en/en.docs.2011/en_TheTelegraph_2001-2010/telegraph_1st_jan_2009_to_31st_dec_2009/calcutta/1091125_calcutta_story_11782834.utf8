The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Brother dies in property fight
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Brother dies in property fight
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 32-year-old man died of injuries inflicted by his elder brother during a row over property.        
	Naresh Das was rushed to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital where he died of brain haemorrhage around 8.30am on Tuesday. Brother Dhaneswar, 40, has been arrested on the murder charge.        
	The duo stayed together in a rented room in Burrabazar while their families live in their native village in Jamui, Bihar.         
	Nandadulal Pal, the officer-in-charge of Burrabazar police station, said Naresh had gone to his brothers shoe shop on Mahatma Gandhi Road on Monday morning and demanded a share of the business.        
	A quarrel broke out between the two and a while later Dhaneswar started beating Naresh on his head with a bamboo pole, Pal said.        
	Naresh, who ran a shoe repair shop on Amherst Street, slumped with blood oozing out of his mouth and nose. Neighbours alerted the police before rushing him to the hospital.        
	He suffered critical injuries in his head and was admitted to the emergency ward of the hospital. He died of brain haemorrhage around 8.30am on Tuesday. The body will be sent for post-mortem on Wednesday, Pal added.        
	An officer probing the case said the relationship between the brothers started souring a couple of years ago over sharing of their ancestral property in Jamui.        
	Relatives said the two often fought over property. Naresh used to say that his elder brother had cheated him and got most of their agricultural land registered in his name. Naresh probably demanded a share in his elder brothers business to compensate for his loss in Jamui, the officer said.        
	We are interrogating Dhaneswar to ascertain whether there was any other motive for the murder besides the property dispute, the officer added.        
	The police have got in touch with Nareshs family members in Jamui and they will reach Calcutta on Wednesday morning.        
	nAssault: Four men were arrested on Tuesday for allegedly attacking five of their tenants in Sankrail, Howrah. Police said Sheikh Tejammal, 55, and his three sons  Gofram, Kamran and Imran  assaulted their tenants in an attempt to evict them. The injured have been admitted to hospital.

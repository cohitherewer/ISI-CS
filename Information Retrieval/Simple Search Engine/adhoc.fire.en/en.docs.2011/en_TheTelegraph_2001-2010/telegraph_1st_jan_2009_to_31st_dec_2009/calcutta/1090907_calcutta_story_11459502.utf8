The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Kudos for green idol campaign
                                                                                                               Kudos for green idol campaign

	The central pollution control board has praised a city initiative to promote the use of lead-free paint on idols though most pujas are yet to opt for non-toxic colours.        
	I found the campaign for lead-free colours impressive and we will definitely consider the model while formulating the national guideline for festival-related immersion, S.P. Gautam, the chairman of the central pollution control board, said on Saturday after visiting Kumartuli idol-makers and attending a meeting of the state pollution control board.         
	A committee appointed by the state government to look into pollution caused by immersion started the campaign recently to encourage the use of lead-free colours on idols as toxic paint pollutes water bodies after immersion.         
	We have nothing against lead-free colours as long as they are available in proper shades and there is a demand in the market. Colours with lead are being used on more idols compared with last year but the overall number is low, said Babu Pal, the general secretary of Kumartuli Mritshilpa Sanskriti Samity.        
	Lead-free paint would have been used on more idols had the campaign started in June, when the idols were booked, said Nemai Pal, a senior idol-maker told Gautam.         
	Two big pujas in Gariahat and Dunlop have communicated to me that they would only take idols with lead-free paint, added Pal. I have five orders for lead-free idols, said idol-maker Nirmal Malik.

	Police on Thursday issued a set of guidelines to housing complexes, highrise buildings and neighbourhood clubs in the city to curb noise pollution from firecrackers and microphones during Kali puja.         
	A senior officer at Lalbazar said illegal firecrackers were mostly burst in highrise buildings and housing complexes. Buildings and complexes have been asked to display copies of the guidelines on their notice boards to inform residents of the dos and donts. Those violating the norms will face action.         
	Lighting fireworks on main roads is also punishable. Crackers producing noise more than 90 decibels are banned, which includes chocolate bombs, dodomas, chain crackers and sound rockets.         
	According to the state pollution control boards guidelines, the use of loudspeakers within 100 metres of hospitals is a criminal offence. In other places, loudspeakers should be fitted with sound limiters to keep the noise under 65 decibels.         
	The use of loudspeakers inside pandals is allowed from 7am to 11am and 6pm to 10pm only for announcements, the officer said.         
	Officers of all 48 police stations have been asked to circulate copies of the guidelines in their respective areas. Special teams from Lalbazar will also keep vigil during the puja, the police said.         
	Officers of Alipore police station have held meetings with residents of 38 buildings and complexes in the area and briefed them about the norms. The residents assured us that they would stick to the guidelines, said an officer of Alipore police station.         
	The police have started carrying out raids and preventive arrests in various trouble-prone areas in the city in the run-up to Kali puja.         
	Over 1,300kg high-decibel firecrackers have been impounded and 13 people arrested in this connection, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner (headquarters).        
	An officer of the detective department said banned firecrackers were mostly smuggled into the city from Budge Budge and Champahati in South 24-Parganas and from Tamil Nadu.        
	We are keeping vigil on all entry points to the city. We are also looking into complaints of forcible collection of puja subscriptions, he added.

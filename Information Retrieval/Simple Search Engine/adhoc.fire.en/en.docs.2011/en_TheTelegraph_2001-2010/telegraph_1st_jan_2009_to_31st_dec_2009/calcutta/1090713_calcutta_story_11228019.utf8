The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Online test to chart right career course
                                                                                                               Online test to chart right career course
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The path to the right career will soon be an online test away.         
	The test, a part of an ABP Group initiative called Aavishkar to be launched on Wednesday, will determine the aptitude and ability of students and suggest career options suitable for them.        
	Students can register online and take the test to get a concrete idea of the careers suitable for them, said a spokesperson.        
	The 80-minute test will examine the ability, interest and personality of a student. The report, to be generated immediately, will comprise the examinees personality profile and ability chart.         
	The students will also be given a chart listing the most suitable careers for them, based on their personality profile, traits, interest and ability, so there is no mismatch between the person and the profession, said Anand Desai, the founder of Dheya, which created the Net test.        
	Students wanting to appear for the test will have to fill up a form that will be published in newspapers and submit it along with a cheque for Rs 600 to any ABP Classified office (the location of the nearest office will be available at 9433019017, 9433192458 and 9339532558).        
	They will be given an envelope containing a welcome letter, a guideline on the process, dos and donts, username, password and authorisation code, added the spokesperson.        
	The students can then go to www.dheya.com and click on the link to Aavishkar, enter their username and password and start the test.        
	Aavishkar will not be limited to the test. There will also be an hour-long career planning session, to be held on Saturdays and Sundays. Students will have to register separately for the session. They will be told about the schedule once they take the test.        
	At these sessions we will help the students chart a career path for the next five-10 years, including which courses they should take, names of the colleges offering such courses and financial planning, said the spokesperson. Workshops to help students pursue their career, improve self-esteem and set goals will also be organised.

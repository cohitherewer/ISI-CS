The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Devi, strike hard at demons of the day
                                                                                                               Devi, strike hard at demons of the day
  - What asuras the astras must slay, forever										      CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA      PUJA POINTERS                                                      
	The gods had decked Durga out in numerous astras: She had 10 arms, though some think 18, but the weapons, replicas of the gods weapons, did not fall short. Shiva gave her the trident, Vishnu the chakra, Vayu bow and arrow, Agni the spear and Indra the thunderbolt, to name a few.         
	Mahishasura came not alone, but in battalions. The Devi vanquished them all. Headless torsos piled up, blood flowed like a river, demons writhed with their limbs chopped off. The lion leapt into the sky. It was a roaring rampage of revenge. Though some headless asuras got up again and tried to give battle.        
	When Mahishasura finally arrived, he changed into many deceiving shapes, first turning into a lion, then an elephant, a buffalo, and was changing form again when the Devi, having drunk from the divine wine-cup, her eyes blood-shot, roared Re Mudha (foolish creature!) and pounced on him, pressing his neck down with her feet. She cut off his head with the kharga.        
	Devi, ignorance thrives still. It morphs over time, it assumes many forms. It resides inside us. Kill it again, as spectacularly, with your choice of weapon. Or with your intelligence.        
	In Calcutta, be on the lookout for vehicles on the roads, 1.5 million daily, sending up black, noxious fumes and choking the heavens. Not that people dont know about kata-tel and 15-year-old vehicles and carbon-dioxide and global warming. But in such a state of Kaliyug nothing will happen without divine intervention. Till then punish us: stop us from buying more cars.        
	Devi, the plastic. Please make it go away, though thats the problem  it stays on, defiant and non-bio-degradable, dancing like headless torsos on a highway thrown away by a passing car, another kind of immortal. Till it goes, allow us no more shopping malls.        
	Devi, stop load-shedding. We will only use LEDs at Puja pandals and switch off the fan, the light, the PC, the TV.         
	Devi, let buses stop speeding and killing. Devi, cleanse our blood of triglycerides, sugar and uric acid. Wash our sins.        
	Finally, kill Lethargy and let Industry thrive in Bengal, by which we dont only mean car factories or SEZs, but also work. Till then let us have no bandhs.        
	Strike hard. Let the demon not recover this time. Let the headless torsos die.

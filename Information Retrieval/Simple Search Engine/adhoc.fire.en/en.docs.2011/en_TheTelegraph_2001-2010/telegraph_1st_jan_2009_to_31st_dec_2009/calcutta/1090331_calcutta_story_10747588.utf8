          A STAFF REPORTER                          Smoke billows out of Nicco House on Friday afternoon. A Telegraph picture                                  
	The fire department has filed an FIR against Nicco Corporation for not taking precautionary measures at Nicco House, where a blaze broke out on Friday afternoon.         
	We mentioned in the FIR that the owners of Nicco House had not taken any firefighting measures in the building. Despite repeated reminders from our department, they did not take any initiative, said Gopal Bhattacharya, the director-general of the West Bengal Fire and Emergency Services. The building did not have a mandatory fire licence, he added. The building, with false ceilings, thousands of computers and other gadgets and almost no open passage, was a tinderbox. There were no fire exits.        
	Rajiv Kaul, the chairman of Nicco Corporation, said: Thank god that there was no loss of life and nobody was injured in the blaze. The fire department is following the legal procedure. As a good corporate house, we will also follow the legal procedure.        
	Witnesses had said the fire was spotted in the second-floor canteen of the building, located at the intersection of Hare Street and Church Lane.         
	The cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained. The forensic report is expected later this week.         
	On Monday, the 100-odd offices in the six-storeyed landmark were closed as electric supply had not been restored after the fire. The heads of a few offices were allowed inside to assess the damage in Fridays fire, the third in eight years.         
	The building administrators havent told us when the electric supply will be restored. So we dont have a clue when we can resume work, said an employee of a tea processing unit in the 60-year-old building. The tenants echoed some of the concerns expressed by the fire department.         
	A senior official of a finance company said the building did not even have a full-time administrative officer.         
	Another tenant said firefighting measures were always inadequate in the building.

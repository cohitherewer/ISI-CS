The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Yash Pal tells VCs to gear up 
                                                                                                               Yash Pal tells VCs to gear up 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Yash Pal at Akshar school on Thursday. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                  
	Veteran educationist Yash Pal on Friday urged the vice-chancellors of various state-aided universities in Bengal to gear up for their upcoming role as self-regulatory bodies.        
	Two days after submitting his report on the renovation and rejuvenation of universities to the ministry of human resource development, Yash Pal underlined the need to give full autonomy to universities.        
	You have to start preparations to shoulder the new responsibilities to be vested in you, Yash Pal told the vice-chancellors of around a dozen universities at Calcutta University.        
	The 82-year-old former chairman of the University Grants Commission (UGC) had earlier this week contacted Suranjan Das, the Calcutta University vice-chancellor, about visiting the university on Friday for an interactive session on the way ahead.        
	In the system recommended by the Yash Pal committee, the universities will have to design their own courses and academic programmes.        
	Under the existing system, they need to follow the rules of the UGC, the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) and the Medical Council of India (MCI) to run undergraduate and postgraduate courses, allowing little flexibility in the framing of syllabi and fixing of subject combinations for students.        
	Why cant someone studying molecular biology be allowed to study music if he wants to? Universities should keep all avenues open for students in terms of subject combination, stressed Yash Pal, who has also recommended the scrapping of the regulatory bodies like the UGC, AICTE and MCI to reduce delays and curb corruption.        
	In the proposed system, a single national-level commission would supervise the universities and act as facilitators for the growth of higher education and research.

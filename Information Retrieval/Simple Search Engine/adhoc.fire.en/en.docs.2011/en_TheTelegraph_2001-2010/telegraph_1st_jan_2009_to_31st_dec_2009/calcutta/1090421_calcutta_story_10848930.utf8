The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Labs labour lost in breakdown of power hotline 
                                                                                                               Labs labour lost in breakdown of power hotline

	Years of research to find cures to chronic diseases have gone waste because of frequent and long power cuts in 24/7 laboratories that need to maintain sub-zero temperatures to preserve samples.        
	The cells that I had generated after one-and-a-half years of research to develop a cure for a lung disease were destroyed during the prolonged power cuts over the past few days. I have to start from scratch now, a researcher at Calcutta Universitys Ballygunge Science College told Metro on Monday, a day after almost the entire city went without power for hours at a stretch.        
	Leaders of biological research teams at Calcutta University and the Indian Institute of Chemical Biology (IICB) said they were not prepared for the frequency and the duration of the power cuts over a fortnight and more. We are supposed to get uninterrupted power supply, an official said.        
	CESC supplies electricity to these laboratories through special high-tension cables that are part of its hotline network. Any institute that avails of this service has to pay more than the normal power tariff.         
	Amit Roy, the secretary in charge of infrastructure at the two science campuses of Calcutta University, said several complaints had been lodged with CESC since the first power failure around three weeks ago. But a senior CESC official said he was unaware of laboratories being affected. We will try to find out what has happened. Something like this obviously wouldnt happen unless there is a serious technical problem.        
	For researchers who spend most of their lives in freezing laboratories poring over tissues and cells that hold the answers to biological puzzles, that is a lame excuse. The samples created by one generation of scientists are stored so that they can be used by the scholars of the next generation. That is how science progresses. But we wont benefit from the expertise of our predecessors because the authorities cant even give us uninterrupted power supply, a junior scientist said.        
	Temperature control is critical to research involving cell and tissue culture and preservation of microorganisms. Some of these will be lost if the temperature rises above minus 55 degrees Celsius for more than a few minutes, a researcher said.        
	So, why dont any of these institutes have power back-up? Calcutta University did not invest in back-up systems because CESC hotline had never let us down before. But we need to arrange for one now, said Dhrubojyoti Chattopadhyay, the pro vice-chancellor (academic).        
	Apart from samples, the laboratories have lost money. We lost more than Rs 68,000 when just one piece of research was spoilt by a three-hour power cut recently, said a senior official of the IICB, which has 40 labs.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | View from window 29A
                                                                                                               View from window 29A
                            
	Prasenjit Guha, 51, a supply chain professional working with Forbes and Company, got the fright of his life on Sunday morning, on board 9W 615 from Mumbai to Calcutta.        
	First, the pilot of the Jet Airways craft slammed the emergency brakes moments before take-off around 7.50am. Then, Guha looked out of the window to see another aircraft on the move towards their craft, barely 150 feet away.        
	The passenger on 29A relived the horror moment for Metro after reaching his Moore Avenue home in south Calcutta.              
	I was happy and relaxed on Sunday morning as I was coming to Calcutta on a week-long vacation.        
	Settled in my seat, as the plane taxied and then went into full throttle, I was waiting for the take-off moment.        
	But that was not to be. There was a sudden thud and I lurched forward, despite the seat-belt.        
	There was silence. Only the sound of pounding hearts. Was it mine or my fellow passengers?        
	I was certain that something had really gone wrong and just hoped that we would be safe.        
	The cabin crew were still seated for take-off. The craft was inching forward.        
	Then I looked out of my window  and got the shock of my life. An Air India aircraft with its nose turned towards us was moving in the direction our craft had been speeding just a moment ago.        
	Thats when I realised that we had been on a collision course with that aircraft and only our pilot slamming the brakes had averted a possible disaster.        
	I was scared.        
	I almost did not notice our aircraft turning around and heading for the parking bay.        
	I almost did not hear an announcement that there had been a problem with the ATC (air traffic control) and that the craft had developed a technical snag.        
	The Air India aircraft was not mentioned, but by then most of us knew what had happened. Yet, no one uttered a word.        
	We were asked to disembark from the aircraft and board another plane. Our luggage was transferred and we took off finally at 9.40am.        
	I breathed easy.        
	My happy homecoming turned out to be the worst flying experience in my 31 years of air travel.        
	What would have happened had the brakes not been applied in the nick of time?        
	Would we have crashed into that Air India plane?        
	I dare not think.                    (AS TOLD TO RITH BASU)

                                                                                                               Joint drive for station facelift
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The bus terminus adjacent to Howrah station                                  
	The state government and the railways are working together to revamp Howrah station and its adjoining areas, including the bus terminus, which is in a shambles.        
	On Monday, chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti discussed the matter with senior officials of the state government, Eastern Railway, Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), Calcutta Port Trust and the Howrah administration.        
	CMDAs plan for developing the bus terminus adjacent to Howrah station was discussed at the meeting. A East-West Metro interface will also be built at Howrah station, said Sumantra Chowdhury, the state transport secretary. Chowdhury conceded that the present condition of the bus terminus was unhealthy and the planning very complex and said around Rs 50 lakh would be spent on the upgrade.         
	Hawkers and vendors have encroached on the terminus premises. There is no proper drainage and sewerage system in the area, leading to frequent waterlogging, said Sanghamitra Ghosh, the district magistrate of Howrah.         
	A railway official said the East-West Metro interface at Howrah station would be set up 20ft underground between platforms 16 and 17.

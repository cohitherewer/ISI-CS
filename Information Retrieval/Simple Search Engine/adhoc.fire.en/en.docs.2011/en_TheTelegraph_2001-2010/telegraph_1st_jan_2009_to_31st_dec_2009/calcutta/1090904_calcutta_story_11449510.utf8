                      World of illusions                    Tagores musical drama Mayar Khela was composed in 1888, a musical play for performance by the members of the Sakhi Samiti. It is a tale of love, of the emotions all human beings experience when they are at lifes crossroads; where conflicting currents of passion and eternal commitment to ones ideals collide, overflow and create new, mesmerising horizons of enchantment. In the absence of an almighty superior being, who peremptorily guides the protagonists in their pursuits of love, a world peopled by nebulous maidens unfolds before the audience. They weave diaphanous webs of illusion and the characters  Shanta, Amar, Pramoda and her retinue of companions, Kumar, Ashoke  get inexorably entangled. This evenings performance will begin with a special introduction and performance by veteran actor-director Aparna Sen and leading Rabindrasangeet exponent Pramita Mallick, to be followed by a presentation of the dance-drama by 40 artistes of Baikali, who will sing and enact their individual roles. Participants: Sasha Ghoshal, Sounak Chattopadhyay, Shruti Naha Sen and others. Anchor: Sujoy Prosad Chatterjee.

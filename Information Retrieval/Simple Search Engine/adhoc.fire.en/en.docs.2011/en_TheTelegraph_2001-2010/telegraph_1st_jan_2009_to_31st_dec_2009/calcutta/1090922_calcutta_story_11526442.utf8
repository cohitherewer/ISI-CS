The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Crater amp; water on key artery
                                                                                                               Crater amp; water on key artery
  - Potholes plague northern link and height hurdle hits southern thoroughfare in the crawl-up to Puja                                              
	Barrackpore Trunk (BT) Road, one of the busiest thoroughfares in the city, is in a mess caused by waterlogging, potholes and encroachments. Traffic on the carriageway is likely to increase manifold during Puja with people from the suburbs heading for the city centre in big numbers. With only a couple days to go for the festival, Metro does a recce of the vital stretch              
	Water woes        
	Even a light shower is enough for water to accumulate on the carriageway at quite a few places, especially between Kamarhati and Rathtala. Residents complained that the accumulated water takes days to recede.         
	The flank for vehicles going towards the city is slightly lower than the Barrackpore-bound one but both flanks get inundated when it rains. The water stays much longer on the city-bound flank, said Biswajit Saha, a carpenter who has set up shop on the road.         
	Vehicles negotiate the stretch slowly and drivers veer towards the dry parts of the road, creating bottlenecks, especially during peak hours.        
	Accidents, too, are common on the stretch, as are fights between drivers sparked by tyres of one vehicle splashing water on the other.        
	Crater corridor        
	BT Road affords a very bumpy ride with the surface cobbled at many places.        
	The situation is worst near Dunlop, where there are large craters in the underpasses. You cant even gauge how deep the holes are because they are filled with muddy water. The rest of the road is also uneven, with rainwater washing off the bitumen and causing waterlogging, Swarup Mondol, a resident of Titagarh who drives down BT Road to his office in central Calcutta in his Maruti 800, told Metro.        
	Taxi-driver Santosh Sahay said the axles of even large vehicles break because of jerks. Patchworks have been done in certain places but that is not enough. The surface was not levelled properly, said Sahay.        
	Pavement peeve        
	A wide variety of encroachments block the BT Road footpaths  from garbage dumps to temples and party offices. As a result, pedestrians are forced to share the carriageway with traffic, throwing caution to the wind.        
	While the bazaar at Titagarh usurps the footpath, giant pay-loaders and trucks do the same at Khardah. You will find cycle stands and building materials on the footpath at Sodepur, said Tapan Kumar Dutta, a 63-year-old retired central government employee who lives in Sodepur.        
	I feel scared walking on the road as any speeding bus or truck can mow me down but there is no choice. And it gets worse during the monsoon, he added.        
	In February, a truck had skidded on garbage that spilled from a vat on the road at Sodepur and fallen on a taxi, killing two persons, recollected another resident, Joginder Singh.        
	The garbage dump still blocks the pavement.         
	Official version        
	Waterlogging on BT Road will stop once the public works department finishes the ongoing work on the drainage system after Puja, said Charon Chakraborty, the chairman of Panihati Municipality.        
	The municipality, he added, had filed police complaints against encroachments after finding that widening of the road earlier in the year had yielded no benefit because of illegal occupation.

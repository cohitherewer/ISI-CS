                      The heart of darkness                    An intriguing exploration of sanity and insanity, passion and pain, Peter Shaffers award-winning play Equus delves into the mind of 17 year-old Alan Strang, who has a strange fascination for horses but blinds six of these animals in an inexplicable fit. The plays action is built over a series of encounters the boy has with a psychiatrist, throwing up more questions than answers to the characters and the audience. It questions conventional notions of normal behaviour and its acceptability in favour of a far more spirited and passionate way of being and experiencing life. It is a play which consciously exists on the edge to understand whether such a state of existence makes sense and to discover why it has come into being. It also asks whether it is possible to imagine any other world, a world which we believe in and therefore create, rather than the other way round. Ranans production focuses on the challenge of addressing the relationship between worship and violence that the play explores through the languages of classical dance and verbal text. Featuring a young group of Kathak dancers and actors, it is a unique, compelling performance that treads the thin line between sensuality and brutality, normalcy and madness, primal forces and contemporary pressures  breaking new ground in the process of the performance. Concept and direction: Vikram Iyengar.                  Event: Equus, a dance and theatre presentation by Ranan When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Gyan Manch

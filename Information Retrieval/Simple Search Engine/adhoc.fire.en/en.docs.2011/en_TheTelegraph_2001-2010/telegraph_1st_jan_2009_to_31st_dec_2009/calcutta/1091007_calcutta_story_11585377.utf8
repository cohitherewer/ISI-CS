                      Celebrating the undying spirit of a city                    Globalisation has made a dramatic if belated foray into Calcutta, once considered the second city of the Raj and Indias cultural capital. The most visible of its impact has been a rapid change in the citys skyline. The outlines of the Victoria Memorial Hall, Howrah Bridge and the Ochterlony Monument (Shahid Minar), that once ruled the citys horizon, have been fast overshadowed by the jagged contours of high-rise and mid-rise buildings and towers  masses of aesthetically dead concrete. The citys built heritage inherited from pre-Independence times may be in the last stage of ruination, but they bear traces of the glamour that once won Calcutta the sobriquet of City of Palaces. Regal and awe-inspiring in their youth, the old buildings have had their grace enhanced by age. Its hauteur mellowed down to quiet dignity, Dalhousie Square is one of the last redoubts of imperialist architecture. White amp; Black: Journey to the centre of Imperial Calcutta takes a clear-eyed view of the changing face of the citys power centre from the tumultuous days of its establishment to our sad times. Dusty and disfigured now, the citys once proud and intimidating architectural structures have acquired the dignity of all those who refuse to be written off. Photographer Christopher Taylor celebrates this spirit in the book through his black-and-white frames, while Soumitra Das captures it in his sweeping narrative. Foreword: Olaf Van Cleef. Published by Niyogi Books, New Delhi. This afternoon, Gopalkrishna Gandhi, Governor of West Bengal, will release the book.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cellphone thefts by student gang 
                                                                                                               Cellphone thefts by student gang 
          KINSUK BASU                                     
	Stealing high-end cellphones and selling them after modifying their software has become the quick fix for fast bucks for students of reputable city schools and colleges.        
	According to the city polices detective department, students of prominent English-medium schools, private engineering colleges and even a medical college were behind the theft of at least six cellphones in recent months.        
	In all the cases, the students involved needed the cash to match the lifestyles of their affluent classmates.        
	The latest incident was on the evening of June 11, near the Exide crossing. Two motorcycle-borne youths attempted to snatch a high-end phone from a woman pedestrian. Hearing her cry for help, another motorcyclist chased the duo and managed to catch the rider. The youth riding pillion fled.         
	Officers of Shakespeare Sarani police station found out that the arrested youth was a Class XII student of a reputable English-medium school near Alimuddin Street while his accomplice was a former student of the same school.        
	One of the boys parents recently retired as a teacher from a reputable English-medium school on AJC Bose Road. The family is financially well-off and none of the members knew the boy was using the motorcycle  gifted to him by his grandfather after he cleared Class X  to snatch cellphones, said an officer of the detective department.         
	During interrogation, he confessed that he had snatched cellphones earlier as well, added the sleuth.        
	Shortly before the incident, policemen had held two second-year electronics and computer engineering students of a city-based private college with branches in Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore for lifting costly Nokia cellphone sets from an Elgin Road store.        
	The teenagers had replaced the stolen sets with dummy ones while checking out phones.        
	In front of their parents in the interrogation room of Lalbazar, the two admitted that they had pulled off the trick at stores in Shyambazar and Gariahat for easy money.        
	The cops did not press charges against the students so that their careers were not hampered and on the request of their parents.        
	Even a police officer has fallen prey to the quick fingers of a bright city student.        
	Recently, we rounded up a fourth-year MBBS student at SSKM for lifting a costly cellphone from the pocket of an assistant commissioner of police, who retired recently. We were shocked by the incident, said another officer.        
	The would-be doctor allegedly stole the cellphone in a melee involving students and cops during an agitation on the campus.        
	He, too, was let off with a warning.        
	Cops said the software of stolen cellphones are modified so that the sets cannot be easily tracked and then handed over to carriers, who take them out of the state.        
	The software of stolen phones are either being modified deftly or the sets are being kept switched off till they cross the state border. It is difficult to track a stolen phone after it leaves Bengal, said the detective department chief, Jawed Shamim.        
	The high-end sets are finding their way to Nepal via Raxaul and Rajmahal, added Shamim.

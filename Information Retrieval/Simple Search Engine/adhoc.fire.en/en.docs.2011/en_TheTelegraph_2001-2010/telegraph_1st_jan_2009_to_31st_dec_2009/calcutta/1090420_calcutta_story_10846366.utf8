The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Poll eyesores pulled down
                                                                                                               Poll eyesores pulled down

	Salt Lake has translated its touch-me-not attitude into action, sending out teams to rid the township of campaign clutter after all parties failed to meet the clean-up deadline.         
	By Sunday evening, four teams deputed by the Bidhannagar administration had removed 847 poll banners, flex hoardings, flags and cut-outs. The drive, billed as the first of its kind in a city where graffiti gangs mock the law, will continue till the last of the political advertisements are pulled down, officials said.        
	We gave the parties an extra day (the original deadline was Thursday evening) but they removed only a fraction of the clutter. So we started the drive on Saturday, said Asoke Kumar Das, the sub-divisional officer of Bidhannagar and assistant returning officer for Barasat constituency.        
	Das said the parties co-operated with the administration during the drive but local campaign managers grumbled about selective removal of banners, hoardings and flags. They are targeting Trinamul banners and keeping those of the CPM intact. We will lodge an official complaint with the sub-divisional officer on Monday, said Sabyasachi Dutta, the president of the Bidhannagar unit of the Trinamul Congress.        
	Dutta also termed the drive unfair and threatened to organise a mass movement if other parts of Calcutta were spared. Why are poll materials being removed only in Salt Lake? he wondered.        
	Soumen Chakraborty, the president of the Salt Lake CPM committee, said his party wouldnt mind if only illegal banners and hoardings were removed. As advised by the Election Commission, we ran a check and removed campaign materials from all the places where these should not be put up. If officials spot any other materials that they think have been illegally put up, they are free to remove those.        
	The four vigilance teams comprise 15 members each, including police personnel, officials of the district administration and a cameraperson to record the process.        
	Residents of the township hailed the drive as a milestone. It feels wonderful to see the childrens park outside my house rid of campaign material. The Election Commission has taken an extraordinary step and I dont think political parties would dare deluge us with illegal poll advertising again, said Subrata Chatterjee, a resident of CK block.        
	Das said the weather affected the pace of the crackdown. Our teams were on the job from 8.30am but the intense heat and humidity slowed them down.         
	The desk of the subdivisional officer had issued 254 showcause notices to parties for violating the model code of conduct and lodged around 200 FIRs, mostly suo motu.

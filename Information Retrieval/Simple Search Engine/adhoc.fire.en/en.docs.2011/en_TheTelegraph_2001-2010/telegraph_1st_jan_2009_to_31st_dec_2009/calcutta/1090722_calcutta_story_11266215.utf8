The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cop shoots down fleeing suspect
                                                                                                               Cop shoots down fleeing suspect
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	An alleged member of a fuel theft racket who was trying to run away from two constables on night patrol on a motorcycle was shot in the head by one of the cops on Maharshi Debendra Road on Tuesday.        
	Saifar Ali had earlier rammed the Maruti 800 he was driving into a lamp post in an alleged attempt to run over the policemen. As his partner Manoj Pal lay injured in the car, the 20-year-old stepped out of the vehicle and started running.        
	Constable Shyamprasad Sen, who had managed to jump out of the path of the car along with his partner Shakti Dangar, opened fire from his service revolver, hitting Ali on the forehead.         
	A surgery was conducted to remove the bullet from the youths head. He is stable, said an officer.        
	The police claimed Ali and Pal were part of a gang that used to siphon oil out of parked cars in north Calcutta, and had been on the run for long.        
	Around 2.45am, the constables noticed the car moving suspiciously and intercepted it. Dangar approached the car from the left and Sen from the right. They asked the driver to show his documents, said Jawed Shamim, the city detective chief.        
	The driver drove the car back before zooming ahead to mow down the cops. The two jumped out of the way and the speeding car hit a lamp post, added Shamim.        
	A preliminary investigation has revealed Ali hailed from Kadamgachi in Barasat and has been involved with the racket for a few years.        
	Pal was produced before a city court and remanded in police custody.

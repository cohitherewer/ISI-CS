The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Risky passage for pedestrians
                                                                                                               Risky passage for pedestrians
                          Pedestrians violate rules rather than wait for the signal at Esplanade            Autos add to chaos at Rashbehari            Vehicles are always plying at Exide                    
	Delhi may have decided to stop traffic flow in all directions at intersections for 20 seconds every once in a while for the benefit of pedestrians but crossing a Calcutta road remains fraught with danger. That people on foot are often not on the planners radar is exemplified by the absence of traffic lights for pedestrians at important intersections around the city. The handful of lights for pedestrians either turns green only for a flicker or does not work. Metro visited four major crossings and found out the problems pedestrians they face        
	Exide        
	The pedestrian count is high at this intersection but there never is a safe time to cross. Vehicles in one or more directions are always plying.        
	I was almost run over last week when a state bus came hurtling down from the direction of Maidan police station, said Ananya Bhattacharya, a singer who is a regular at Nandan and Rabindra Sadan.        
	Some flanks of the intersection have lights for those on foot while at the others pedestrians are left to their own devices. The light on a Chowringhee flank turned green for three seconds on one occasion  not enough to cross even half the stretch. The next time it turned green only for a second.        
	Pedestrians stood on the carriageway and did not wait for vehicles to stop before crossing the road. Just look at them throwing themselves in front of the vehicles, remarked a traffic sergeant who had parked his bike in front of Haldirams.         
	Chowringhee-Elgin Road        
	The crossing has traffic lights for pedestrians that misguide those on foot. When the light turned green, an elderly man started to cross Sambhunath Pandit Street but had to take a step back when a taxi coming from Hazra took a sharp left turn. The light was green for the taxi, too. At intervals, both the red and green stopped glowing.        
	When its green you cross, when its red you dont cross and when its neither, it probably means cross at your own risk, said Suraj Chadha, a resident of the area.        
	Rashbehari        
	Autorickshaws are the main reason for chaos at this crossing, which does not have traffic lights for pedestrians. Autos make U-turns at the crossing, slowing down traffic. Officers managing traffic have no idea what is going on and have no control over the situation, said Shramana Mondal, a first-year MA student in English at Calcutta University.         
	Sandip Mukerjee, 59, felt autorickshaw stands should be moved away from the intersection. Indiscipline is rampant. Pedestrians also need to be more patient, he said.              
	Esplanade        
	Pedestrians have to wait very long to cross the road at this intersection. The light stays red for seven to eight minutes. As a result, people try to wriggle through moving cars and buses.        
	Civic police volunteers struggle to rein in pedestrians with long ropes. Their presence makes the KC Das crossing more chaotic, said Ratna Kundu, a pedestrian.              
	Activists version: According to a recent edition of the Indian Police Journal, drivers are to blame for 85 per cent of the road mishaps. But the state government always blames the pedestrian. This indicates a mindset problem that the authorities have to overcome, said Sabuj Mukherjee of Rethinking Development, an NGO that has been championing the cause of pedestrians.              
	Police voice: There are problems with the traffic signal system in Calcutta and it will be overhauled shortly. We have formed a planning and survey team under additional commissioner (traffic) K. Harirajan and it is working on the problem, said police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti.

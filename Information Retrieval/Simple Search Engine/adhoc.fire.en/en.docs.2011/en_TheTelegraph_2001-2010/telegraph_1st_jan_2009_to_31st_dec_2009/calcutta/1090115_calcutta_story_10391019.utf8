The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bus race crushes man 
                                                                                                               Bus race crushes man 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A man in his mid-40s was caught in the mad rush for passengers by two private buses and crushed to death near the Ultadanga underpass on Wednesday afternoon.        
	Khokan Das, a resident of Habra in North 24-Parganas, was declared dead at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital.        
	A preliminary investigation revealed that two private buses on the Basirhat-Howrah route were trying to overtake each other when the mishap occurred.         
	Pradip Chatterjee, the joint commissioner of police (administration), said the incident occurred around 2pm after Das, a dealer in iron rods, got down from one of the two racing buses.        
	He boarded the bus at Barasat. As the bus stopped on the southern flank of the underpass near the Ultadanga railway station, he got off from the rear gate, said Chatterjee.        
	He was crushed under the wheels of another bus on the same route, which was trying to overtake the other from the wrong side, he added.        
	As soon as the man was hit, the drivers of both buses jumped out of their cabins and fled, leaving their vehicles behind.        
	Local people took Das to hospital, but he was dead by then, having suffered severe head and chest injuries.         
	Passengers of the two buses alleged that the drivers had been racing from Lake Town. Both wanted to pick up passengers from busy spots like Ultadanga, Khanna, Maniktala and MG Road, they pointed out.        
	Regular commuters on the route said racing was a daily occurrence.        
	Whenever bus drivers spot other buses on their route, they start racing, said an officer of the traffic department.

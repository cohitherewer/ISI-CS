                                                                                                               Cops list fake note operatives 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The Special Task Force (STF) of Calcutta police is compiling a list of 25 operatives involved in spreading fake currency notes across the country.         
	People in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal are spreading more than Rs 1,000 crore in fake notes in India every year. The notes are printed in Bangladesh, said an STF officer.        
	Rajeev Kumar, the joint commissioner of police (STF), said the racketeers sneaked into the country with their consignments from Bangladesh and Nepal. The racket is being operated by 25 people, some of who are based in Pakistan, he said.        
	The agents in India contact bank officials in remote places in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. The officials are offered lucrative commissions and the fake notes find their way into bank vaults, said an officer.         
	The STF started its probe following the arrest of a Bangladeshi man, Yakub, who admitted to having delivered more than Rs 100 crore in fake notes to clients in Calcutta, Delhi and Mumbai last year.

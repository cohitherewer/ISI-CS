The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fish swim on the road
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Fish swim on the road
										      caleidoscope                                              Tracy Lee Stum and her street painting at the Government College of Art   and Craft and (below) Tarapada Chakraborty. Picture by Aranya Sen      
	Tracy Lee Stum sits on the steps of the Government College of Art and Craft watching the students pore over her street painting of fish swimming in clear blue waters, done in coloured chalk.         
	A professional artist for 26 years, Tracy says she used to specialise in murals, till she visited California in 1998. I saw a gathering in front of Mission Church and thought it was a festival. But it was people painting on the streets. They were so beautiful, I was hooked. The next year I participated in the festival, recalls the US-based artist.         
	There was no looking back. I would take part in as many as 10 festivals a year. Then I started getting invited to these festivals. Later, some public relations people approached me to paint something with a message. Now this covers 75 per cent of my work, she says.         
	Street painting started in Italy in the 16th century, by people living on the streets, who painted for money. The themes were religious, often the Madonna, which is why they were called the madonnaras.         
	Though Tracy studied the madonnaras, her paintings are very different, she says. I like to create a world where the spectator can be drawn in. There is an element of fantasy to her works, accentuated by a 3-D effect. I had studied painting techniques in Italy. I wanted to do the kind of work that Andrea Pozzo did on the ceiling of the Church of Jesuits. So I studied perspective, spoke with a professor of mathematics online and went through a lot of trial and error, she smiles.         
	The scope for experiment is one of the best things about this art form, feels the artist. Its not expensive, so you have the scope of making mistakes. And its faster. Its heartening to teach, too, says the artists.         
	But the work is temporary. It gets washed away, cars go over them. The first time I had trouble detaching myself from the work. But now I am over a work as soon as it is done, she says.         
	This is my second trip to India. I find the Taj Mahal the most astoundingly perfect thing I have seen in my life. It inspires calm, Tracy exclaimed. In Calcutta, she gave the sari a go and found it very comfortable and elegant.         
	A long journey         
	From Kotalipara to Kolikata, it had been a difficult journey for the teenaged boy. But Tarapada Chakraborty, a doyen of Hindustani vocal music, of course, did not stop there. For a khayaliya from Bengal, he went on to scale rare heights, mesmerising not only his audiences but also such illustrious colleagues as Faiyaz Khan, Omkarnath Thakur and Abdul Karim Khan. It is all the more surprising, therefore, that so little of Chakrabortys legendary genius has survived the vagaries of public memory, especially in his home state, as he enters his centenary this year.         
	Starting today, Paramparik, headed by Manas Chakraborty (the maestros son) is organising a series of concerts to commemorate the formidable tradition left behind by Chakraborty. Apart from performances by Rashid Khan, Hariprasad Chaurasia, Buddhadeb Dasgupta, Manilal Nag, Rajan and Sajan Mishra, among others, a number of CDs and books on Chakraborty are expected to come out.       POULOMI BANERJEE AND SOMAK GHOSHAL

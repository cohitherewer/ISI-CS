	If South City Mall has set a benchmark for retail development in the city, the South City International School hopes to do the same in education. We want the school to be better than what exists in the city. International tie-ups, an interactive system of teaching and skill development centres will be its biggest draws, says Sushil Mohta, the director of South City Projects.         
	The co-educational, English-medium school housed in a five-storey building, has a built-up area of 127,000 sq ft and sprawls across 3.6 acres. To be completed by April this year, the school has admissions open from Montessori to Class V, under the Cambridge Primary Years programme blended with the Inter-State Board of Anglo-Indian Education curriculum. Classes VI, VII and VIII will start from April 2010 under a system that blends the Inter-State Board of Anglo-Indian Education curriculum and the Cambridge International system of assessment. Classes IX and X will start in 2010 (Cambridge University International Examinations/ IGCSC/ O-level certificate) and 2012 (ICSE).         
	The senior secondary level (classes XI, XII) will offer a triple option  Council of Indian School Certificate Examinations (ISC) by 2014, Cambridge University International Examinations (IGCSE/ A level certificate) by 2012 and International Baccalaureate Organisation (IBO Diploma) by 2012.We have tied up with Oxford University so that students can study overseas later, adds Mohta.         
	Air-conditioned classrooms and labs, CCTVs, learning resource centres, interactive boards and laptops for teachers are part of the Rs 25-crore project. There will also be design and technology, art and craft, home economics, meditation, dance and music centres and a multi-gym.

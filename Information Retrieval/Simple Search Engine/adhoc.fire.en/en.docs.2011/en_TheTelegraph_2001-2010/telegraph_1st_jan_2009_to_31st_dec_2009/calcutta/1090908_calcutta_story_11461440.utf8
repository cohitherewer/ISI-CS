                      Ethics and the modern world                    Most of us spend our lives wrestling with day-to-day questions of right and wrong, to which we find no easy or definite answers. Gurcharan Das The Difficulty of Being Good turns to the Mahabharata in order to answer the question, why be good? and discovers that the epics world of moral haziness and uncertainty is closer to our experience as ordinary human beings than the narrow and rigid positions that define most debate in this fundamentalist age of moral certainty. The Mahabharata is obsessed with the elusive notion of dharma, in essence, doing the right thing. Its characters are flawed: they stumble and everyone weighs upon their action from a different and often contradictory perspective. However, their incoherent experiences throw light on familiar emotions of anxiety, courage, despair, remorse, envy, compassion, vengefulness and duty. As the Mahabharatas story unfolds in Das book, the focus shifts from one character to another  Bhishma, Yudhisthira, Arjuna, Draupadi, Duryodhana, Karna, Aswathhama and Krishna  their ethical problems and the significance of their issues on our lives. Whereas his book India Unbound examined the aim of material well-being, his latest work dwells on the goal of dharma or moral well-being. It holds up a mirror to our lives, confronting us with the many ways in which we deceive ourselves and others. What emerges is a doctrine that can be applied to business decisions, political strategies and inter-personal relationships; in effect, to life itself. This evening, Penguin Books India and The American Centre host the launch of The Difficulty of Being Good and a panel discussion based on it. Panelists: Rajat Kanta Ray, Reba Som, Rudrangshu Mukherjee and the author.                  Event: Launch of a book by Gurcharan Das followed by a panel discussion When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Satyajit Ray auditorium, 9A Ho Chi Minh Sarani

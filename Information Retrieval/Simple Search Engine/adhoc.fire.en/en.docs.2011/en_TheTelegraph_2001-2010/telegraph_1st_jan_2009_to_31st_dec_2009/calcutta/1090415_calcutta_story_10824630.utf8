The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Old woes of New Market
                                                                                                               Old woes of New Market
                                          
	Illegal autorickshaw and taxi stands, hawkers, unruly traffic and pedestrian indifference make the New Market area a perpetual mess. Metro runs a check              
	Auto and taxi stands        
	Autos on five routes ply from near the SN Banerjee Road-Market Street crossing. During rush hours, scores of three-wheelers and taxis are parked on both sides of Market Street, often in three rows, eating into more than half the carriageway. Auto drivers are the worst offenders, they have made a habit of flouting traffic rules. There is nothing one can do to control them, said a police officer.        
	I have to spend 10-15 minutes everyday to cross the SN Banerjee Road-Market Street intersection during rush hours, mainly because of the autos, said Karunamoy Bandopadhyay, a trader.              
	Hawker hurdle        
	Both pavements of Market Street, Grant Street, Lindsay Street and near Corporation Place have been taken over by hawkers, forcing pedestrians to walk on the carriageway. The situation worsens during festive seasons, especially Poila Baisakh and Durga puja.        
	We cant ask people to use the pavement as they are occupied by hawkers. As a result, the pedestrians walk on the carriageway, slowing down traffic, said a cop.        
	The condition of Humayun Place and Lindsay Street is the worst in the area, with vendors occupying pavements and a part of the carriageway and numerous cars parked along the road.        
	Commuters blame the hawkers and the growing number of vehicles for the chaos at key crossings. With so many people walking on the road, one cant always blame drivers for breaking rules, said Vashi Barwani, a shop-owner in New Market.              
	Lack of bus stops        
	In the absence of proper bus stops on SN Banerjee Road, bus drivers pick up passengers wherever they want to, even from the middle of the road. The stretch between Janbazar and the Jawaharlal Nehru Road-SN Banerjee Road crossing is a nightmare, with commuters scampering to get on and off buses near New Market.        
	The way buses run on the stretch, accidents are just waiting to happen, said Bilal Maqsood, 27, a paan shop-owner near Elite Cinema.                
	Mixed signals        
	There are no traffic lights for pedestrians at the crossings near New Market and hardly any traffic cops. The traffic volume is very high and pedestrians rule the roads, said Jason Brent, a student.              
	Pedestrian indifference        
	Less than five per cent of pedestrians use the pavements. At any time of the day, hundreds of people can be seen walking down the carriageways of Market Street, Grant Street, Lindsay Street, Corporation Place and Humayun Place. More often than not, pedestrians are responsible for the chaos, said a constable, pointing to people dodging vehicles on Grant Street.               
	Officials version        
	Policemen at Headquarters Traffic Guard, responsible for traffic in the area, said there was a manpower crunch. We cannot do more under the present circumstances. This is one of the most difficult areas to manage, said an officer.        
	Hawker unions affiliated to the Citu and the Trinamul and local political leaders oppose attempts to shift the hawkers, saying in any other place, they would not find suitable clientele.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bottleneck at airport door delays fliers
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Bottleneck at airport door delays fliers

	You might be able to beat the queue at the airline counter with a tele check-in but you cant escape the traffic jam at the door to the domestic terminal of Calcutta airport.        
	Poor passenger management by the airport authorities has created a permanent bottleneck at the entrance, resulting in multiple queues that often spill onto the road during the morning rush hour.         
	First-time flier Supriyo Bose, who had arrived at the airport two hours before his scheduled flight to Delhi last Tuesday hoping to see things happen like clockwork, was surprised to find a queue at the entrance longer than the one at the Maddox Square puja pandal.        
	Raghavendra Chowdhury, who had spent an hour at the airport the previous morning, found the queue of passengers spilling out from the trolley alley to the road.         
	In the haze of the sodium vapour lights, the long queue resembled a concentration camp roll call, he said.         
	Airport director R. Srinivasan blamed the bottleneck on an increase in festive traffic and flaws in infrastructure, ignoring the main malaise of his team not looking where they should.        
	The number of passengers and flights have gone up significantly over the last six months with the travel market recovering from the downturn, he said.         
	According to official statistics, the number of passengers who boarded flights from Calcutta in October was over seven per cent more than the figure for the same period last year. Also, there was a nearly four per cent increase in aircraft traffic out of Calcutta in October, compared to the same month last year, said Srinivasan.        
	When Metro surveyed the bottleneck zone on Tuesday morning, not a single official was deployed there to stop passengers from forming multiple queues converging on the narrow entrance where tickets are checked by CISF personnel.        
	While queue management was non-existent, the CISFs strict security regimen showed what could be achieved with initiative and discipline.         
	Each time the trolleys accumulating inside were brought out from a side door, an armed CISF sentry would materialise from nowhere and stand guard to prevent people from sneaking in.         
	I saw the trolleys being brought out at least 10 times, and the sentry was at the side door like clockwork. But a few feet from him there was this bus adda-like chaos because of the bottleneck at the entry point for passengers, said a south Calcutta resident who had gone to the airport to see off a family member.        
	So what is the solution?        
	The problem can be easily solved if an official is deployed to ensure only two queues  one for hand-baggage passengers and another for those with more luggage. Even one queue should work as long as it moves, which it cannot when different lines converge on a narrow outlet. The problem is with leadership and lack of initiative, said a frequent flier who now goes to the airport at least two hours before the scheduled check-in lest he be stuck in a queue.        
	Srinivasan said Calcutta airports domestic and international terminal buildings were presently handling more than 12,000 passengers every day, against around 9,000 until a few months earlier.

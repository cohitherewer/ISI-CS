The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fish culture plan for NRS pond
                                                                                                               Fish culture plan for NRS pond

	To battle the mosquito menace on its premises, Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital (NRS) will use its 1.3-acre pond for pisciculture.         
	The NRS authorities had written to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) four months ago to take up the ponds maintenance work as part of a beautification project for the hospital.        
	Fish cultivation will help curb the problem of mosquitoes. We want the water body to be maintained properly. People urinate in it. A lot of problems will also be solved if saplings are planted along the banks of the pond, said Laxmi Kanta Ghosh, the medical superintendent of NRS.         
	The letter to the civic body was sent after consulting environment minister Manab Mukherjee, who is also the chairman of the hospitals governing body. We want the water body to be an asset and hence the proposal for fish cultivation. We may hand over the project to a self-help group if the proposal is cleared. Our main objective is the beautification of the whole hospital, said Mukherjee.         
	Faiyaz Ahmed Khan, member, mayor in council, parks and gardens, said he had received the proposal. We usually approve such proposals but we will have to look into the funds needed for the project. We have also received beautification proposals from RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, and Medical College and Hospital, said Khan.         
	A senior CMC official said the civic authorities had carried out an inspection on the NRS premises a week ago but the nod for fish cultivation has to come from the public works department (PWD). Only the PWD can okay the pisciculture project. As for the beautification drive, we will soon sit with the hospital authorities and draw up a plan, the official said.         
	The pond, located on the western side of the hospital between the Centenary and UNB buildings, is currently a breeding ground of mosquitoes.        
	The banks are littered with waste, some of which spills into the stagnant water. The railings around the pond have disappeared.         
	There is a long-standing confusion over who is supposed to clean the pond, the CMC or the PWD. As a result, there is no maintenance. We get the pond cleaned after long gaps, said superintendent Ghosh.         
	The long neglect is taking a toll on the hospital complex. Visitors dirty the banks, and staff members and outsiders use the pond for bathing and washing clothes.        
	You cant take the shortcuts around the pond because of the terrible stench, said Anjan Boral, a patients relative.

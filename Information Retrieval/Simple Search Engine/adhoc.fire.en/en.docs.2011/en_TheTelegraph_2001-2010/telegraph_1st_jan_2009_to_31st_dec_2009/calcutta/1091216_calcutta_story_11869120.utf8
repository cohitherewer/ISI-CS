                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Newborn rescued from cornice
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A newborn girl was rescued from the window cornice of a third-floor apartment in Gorabazar, Dum Dum, on Tuesday morning.        
	A resident spotted the child, wrapped in a towel and plastic sheet, lying almost at the edge of the cornice. He alerted the residents of the building who, in turn, got in touch with police.        
	One of our men climbed down to the cornice holding a rope tied to the terrace of the five-storeyed building. Another officer climbed up the adjacent building and held out two sticks to prevent the baby from falling off the cornice. Other cops had by then descended on the upper cornices and took turns to lift the baby to the terrace, said an officer of Dum Dum police station.        
	The cops have no clue who had left the child to die. The baby was taken to a hospital run by South Dum Dum Municipality and later shifted to Sukanya home in Salt Lake.

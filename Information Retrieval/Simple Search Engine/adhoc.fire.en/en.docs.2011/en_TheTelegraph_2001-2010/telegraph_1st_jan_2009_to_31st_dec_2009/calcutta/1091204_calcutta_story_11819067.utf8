The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Smart-card shutdown 
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Smart-card shutdown

	Smart-card turnstiles at the four new Metro stations on the extended southern route stopped functioning on Wednesday evening, sending commuters who had opted for these to save time and money back to the counters for paper tickets.         
	 We were told that the smart-card gates were out of order and that buying a paper ticket was the only way out. Thats so unfair considering my smart card is still loaded with more than Rs 100 worth of rides, complained Seema Mukherjee, who commutes daily between Garia Bazar (Kavi Nazrul) and Esplanade.         
	Metro officials said technical glitches in the smart-card turnstiles at the new stations  Kudghat (Netaji), Naktala (Gitanjali) and Bansdroni (Masterda Surya Sen) are the other three  worsened on Wednesday evening.         
	 The smart-card gates were malfunctioning for a long time. We are trying to repair them as quickly as possible, said J. K. Mitra, the chief operations manager of Metro Railway.         
	He said commuters carrying smart cards could enter or exit the four new stations by showing these to security personnel, but advised that they purchase multi-ride paper tickets that cost almost the same across zones.        
	So what happens to the loaded smart cards? Commuters can get a refund by surrendering their cards, an official said.        
	But for those who travel to and from the extended route only occasionally, surrendering their smart cards might not be the best option because the smart-card gates in all the old stations  from Tollygunge to Dum Dum  are still working.         
	Passengers who walked into the chaos at the new stations said they missed trains because the Metro authorities closed the smart-card gates without prior announcement.         
	I hold a smart card but had to stand in a long queue to buy a paper ticket. I missed two trains, said Subhajit Das, a student who takes the Metro from Naktala.         
	Metro is planning to replace the existing smart-card system at all stations with an upgraded version. The Central Railway Information System will take around seven months to install the new system.

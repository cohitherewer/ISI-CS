										      ONTHESPOT - AJC BOSE ROAD FLYOVER                            Ragpickers have made their home under the AJC Bose Road flyover and (above) traffic flow has increased fivefold after the flyover was commissioned. Pictures by Talat Salahuddin                                
	Circus Avenue in south Calcutta is one of the oldest affluent areas of the city. Avenue is a misnomer since none of the earlier greenery in this area exists. Tall trees lined the entire stretch, with bowers over the carriageway, making it in an avenue in the truest sense.         
	Today all that has been replaced with concrete jungle. Highrises and the AJC Bose Road flyover now dominate the skyline. A number of old trees were felled when the flyover was constructed.         
	The underside of the flyover is now occupied by several families of ragpickers with the railings of the footbridge and pavements serving as their clothesline. Illicit liquor and drugs are available in the shanties.        
	I always keep my windows closed to shut out the unseemly sights.We dont get fresh air and sometimes feel suffocated. Neither the Pollution Control Board nor the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) are doing anything. Previously they had promised that they would create a garden underneath the flyover but five years have passed and not a single sapling has been planted, said Shyamal Mitra, a local resident.        
	Residents had also dreamt of hassle-free, smooth flowing traffic on the flyover. But that has remained a dream. Besides, the AJC Bose Road flyover and No. 4 Bridge lead to massive traffic chaos at the seven-point crossing at Park Circus. It is a confluence of seven busy and prominent city arteries, including Park Street, Shakespeare Sarani, Syed Amir Ali Avenue, Suhrawardy Avenue and Circus Avenue.         
	After the flyover was commissioned, traffic on the stretch has increased fivefold since most motorists take the flyover to reach Esplanade or Dalhousie Square. Owing to the heavy load of traffic, residents of the lanes and bylanes of the area find it very difficult to drive to the main road.                     
	I never see any traffic police in Meher Ali Lane and Circus Avenue by-lanes. At night, particularly after 10.30pm, autos, buses , trucks and taxis flout traffic rules with impunity as they know that there are no traffic policemen, said Rajiv Ghosh, a regular commuter in the area.              
	Policespeak: Over the last few years the number of vehicles has increased at the Park Circus seven-point crossing. We are deploying more traffic cops on the stretch and they are doing a good job. I dont agree that there is no traffic management in the adjacent lanes and bylanes. All the crossings are important for us. We often slap spot fines on walkers if they are found violating traffic rules, said Dilip Banerjee, the deputy commissioner of traffic police        
	CMCspeak: This flyover has been built by the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners. They are responsible for the destruction of the greenery, said Somnath Chatterjee of the civic bodys park and gardens wing.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A newly-married woman was crushed to death and her husband seriously injured after their motorcycle was hit from behind by a trailer in the port area on Sunday afternoon.        
	Lovely Thaware, 27, died instantly while husband Vicky, also 27, was admitted to the intensive care unit of CMRI with injuries on his chest.        
	His 55-year-old father Tushar, a trader, suffered a cardiac arrest in the hospital after hearing of his daughter-in-laws death. He, too, was admitted to the intensive care unit of CMRI.        
	Both Lovely and Vicky worked for a private telecom company. They met at work and married on November 22 last year.         
	Vicky left home around 9.30am with Lovely. He had a lunch invitation at his in-laws house in Garden Reach. The mishap took place when they were returning home, said Tushars brother Lalit.        
	The trailer hit the two-wheeler from behind at the intersection of Satya Doctor Road and Central Garden Reach Road around 3.40pm. Lovely, who was riding pillion, fell on the road and was crushed under the wheels of the trailer, said the joint commissioner of police (administration), Pradip Chatterjee.        
	The driver of the trailer was arrested and the vehicle impounded.         
	The police rang up the Thawares Bhowanipore house shortly after the accident and informed them about the mishap.        
	Vickys parents rushed to CMRI and learnt about Lovelys death. Tushar Thaware immediately fell unconscious. Doctors told us that he had suffered a massive heart attack, said a police officer.        
	Rupa Kundu, who lives next to Thawares, saw the couple leave house on the motorcycle in the morning.         
	Lovely came here recently but we became friends soon. I even wished her a happy journey this morning. I am shocked that she is no more, said Rupa.

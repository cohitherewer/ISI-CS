The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Decades for poll pleas
                                                                                                               Decades for poll pleas
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	More than a hundred petitions challenging the results of various Lok Sabha and Assembly elections have been pending in the high court for decades. The petitions were mostly filed by candidates who had lost the polls and the allegations include rigging by rival parties and malpractice by polling personnel during the counting of votes.        
	The process to dispose of such petitions is lengthy. On most occasions the proceedings continue till the dates of the next elections are announced, by when the petitioners lose their interest in pursuing the cases, said an official in the law department.        
	Dibyendu Biswas, who had fought on a Congress ticket from Ballygunge in the 1992 Assembly bypoll and lost to the CPMs Rabin Deb by 600 votes, had moved the high court alleging malpractice during the final round of counting of votes.        
	The counting was held at Kshudiram Anushilan Kendra. I was leading till the final round when power went off. Poll officials announced that the few ballots that were left would be taken up the next day. But soon after our party agents left the counting centre, power supply was restored and Deb was declared the winner. I moved the high court seeking a fresh count, Biswas recalled.        
	Asked why he did not press for disposal of the case, Biswas said: After hearing my submission, the bench ordered a recount which was held on the high court premises. But while the counting was on, the date of the next Assembly polls was announced and I lost interest in continuing with the matter.        
	Similar was the case with Congress candidate Idris Ali, who lost the 1999 parliamentary election from Arambagh to the CPMs Anil Bose. Ali moved the high court but even before the hearing could end, the poll panel announced the dates for the 2001 general elections.        
	Courts should dispose of election petitions as early as possible, preferably within a year, so the petitioners could get some relief, said high court lawyer Sardar Amjad Ali, who had moved a case after losing the Assembly polls in Satgachia to Jyoti Basu in 1997. Alis petition is still pending.

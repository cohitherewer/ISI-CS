					      Todays question: Should the college authorities go soft on ragging? More responses will be published next week

  Address not mentioned									      
	The authorities should not show any mercy towards the students who rag their juniors. If they can be inhuman, then the authorities have every right to punish them. The way students are ragged these days is nothing short of torture. Raggers should be rusticated and put behind bars.               
	

Prabhar Sen Sarma,

	The college authorities must not go soft on students guilty of ragging. They should be punished keeping in view the Supreme Court order in this regard.               
	

Diptimoy De, 
  Barisha									      
	I graduated from the second oldest engineering college in India, now known as Besu, 50 years ago. When we were freshers our seniors did not subject us to physical torture in the name of ragging. It was a one-night affair, usually a leg-pulling session at midnight. The next evening there was a gathering where each fresher had to disclose his reactions to the previous nights session. A treat followed but one of the items contained a strong purgative. The next morning seniors locked the doors of all toilets. The rest is anybodys guess. It was full of fun and evoked no animosity. This type of intelligent and soft ragging built rapport among the juniors and seniors.                Md. Sarfaraz Alam, 
  Kamarhati									      
	Ragging is not just an offence, it has become a social evil that has ruined the lives of many students. Ragging can be done in an amicable manner to build a bond with newcomers but can be dangerous if it goes out of control. There is no point in going soft on students guilty of ragging and even on people supporting them. It should be treated as an unpardonable crime because it sometimes leads to suicide.              
	

Govind Das Dujari,
  Behala									      
	Ragging is becoming a social disease that kills students mentally if not physically. When I was in BIT Ranchi about 35 years ago, ragging was not violent or sadistic. Juniors were ragged in a way that they enjoyed. The aim was to get to know them better and help them cope with homesickness. Ragging is a vicious circle. Students, who were victims of violent ragging in their first year, do the same to freshers in their second year.               
	

Oishimaya Sen, 
  Tollygunge									      
	Rag means to taunt or make fun of. The distinction between friendly ragging and violent ragging should not be made. Ragging in any form is not good. It can kill an individuals self-respect. It is important to punish students accused of ragging. The concept that a student who has ben ragged has better relations with his seniors and can handle future hardships better, has no basis.              
	

Debashis Ghosh,
  Massachusetts, USA									      
	I graduated from Jadavpur University decades ago when ragging was taken for granted. As a former boarder, I know the emotional toll the brutality meted out in the guise of welcoming freshers takes. Back then, seniors and freshers who protested were a minority and were brushed aside.               
	

Jayanta Mukherjee, 
  Howrah									      
	Students who rag are beasts in human form. They have no place in civilised society. Those who are involved in ragging should be caned publicly. Only severe punishment can eradicate this crime.              
	

Jaya Ghosh, 
  Sarat Banerjee Road									      
	Ragging becomes a crime when it goes out of control. It leads to loss of lives, permanent physical and mental scars and even affects careers. The perpetrators of such heinous, barbaric acts should never be allowed to get away. They must be severely punished and if the college authorities cannot do this on their own, they must take the help of the government and the judiciary.              
	

Rakesh Sengupta,
  Dum Dum									      
	Over the years ragging has transformed into a despicable form of bullying. There is no question of colleges going soft on ragging. In fact colleges should see to it that ragging is not encouraged and those responsible for it punished.               
	

Rakhi Bishnu, 
  Barasat									      
	There is no point in going soft on raggers. Educational institutions should act strictly against students guilty of ragging so that others think twice before victimising their juniors.       Send your views to

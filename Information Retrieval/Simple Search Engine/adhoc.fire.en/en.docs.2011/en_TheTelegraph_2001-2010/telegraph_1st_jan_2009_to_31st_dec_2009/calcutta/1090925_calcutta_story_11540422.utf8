                      Suppressed song of the soul                    Perhaps the most talented and popular singer of Tagore songs, Debabrata Biswas was also a thinker and a radical in the true sense and one who lived far ahead of his time. His life and experiences are a reflection of the reality and subsistence of the pre-Independence Bengali community and form the subject matter of Bratyajans latest production, Ruddhasangeet, to be staged today on the occasion of its first anniversary. The play bears historic testimony to the lives of Bengalis in east Bengal, and of their social, economic and political upheavals through almost half a century. Debabrata Biswas involvement with and severance from Gana Natya Sangha, his renunciation of the communist party, his differences with the music board of Visva Bharati and his inexorable rise to fame and his opposition to socially-renowned institutions are focused upon in varying degrees within multiple levels of the play. Apart from the central protagonist, many other fascinating and celebrated personalities of his era, including Hemango Biswas, Salil Chowdhury, Ritwick Ghatak, Sombhu Mitra, Tripti Mitra, Bijon Bhattacharya, Jyoti Basu, Pramod Dasgupta, Suchitra Mitra and Manjusri Chaki Sircar feature as characters in the play.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Stem cell hope for treating palsy
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Stem cell hope for treating palsy

	A new line of treatment using stem cells conducted in Singapore may open up a window of hope for patients of cerebral palsy in the city.         
	Cord blood banking major CordLife, which is headquartered in Singapore and has its India subsidiary in Calcutta, announced on Wednesday the use of cord blood to treat cerebral palsy for the first time in Asia.         
	The patient, two-and-a-half-year-old Georgia Conn, was infused with her own cord blood stem cells to repair brain tissue damaged during birth.         
	We are in a position to bring the technology to Calcutta very quickly, Steven Fang, the group CEO of CordLife Ltd, told Metro.        
	Fang added that CordLife Sciences India, the groups partly owned Indian subsidiary, was in dialogue with neurological and paediatric centres in the city for bringing the technology to Calcutta.         
	This is wonderful news, since at least one in every 500 kids suffers from cerebral palsy, and theres no other cure, said Amitabha Ghosh, a senior consultant neurologist at Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals.        
	The treatment has been performed on 97 patients at Duke University in the US. But this is the first time the treatment is available in Asia, said Fang. The treatment cost is around 10,000 Singapore dollars (over Rs 3 lakh), but is expected to come down substantially.         
	Cerebral palsy may result from prenatal complications, because of lack of oxygen to the baby during labour or an injury after birth. The disorder affects the control of movement and posture. The symptoms vary in sev- erity from poor muscle co-ordination to quadriplegia (paralysis).        
	Little Georgia used to be in terrible pain and suffer up to 50 seizures a day. Luckily, her parents had decided to bank her cord blood. We never thought we would need it. But since the stem cell procedure, we have noticed changes in her temperament, concentration and engagement, use of vocalisation and renewed energy for life and exercises, said Georgias mother Louise.        
	Keith Goh, the lead clinician and neurosurgeon who conducted the procedure, said: Stem cells, especially those derived from cord blood, have enormous potential for new growth and regeneration of damaged tissue.        
	Cord blood is the preferred source of stem cells for transplantations and over 14,000 patients have been treated with it for more than 80 diseases worldwide.

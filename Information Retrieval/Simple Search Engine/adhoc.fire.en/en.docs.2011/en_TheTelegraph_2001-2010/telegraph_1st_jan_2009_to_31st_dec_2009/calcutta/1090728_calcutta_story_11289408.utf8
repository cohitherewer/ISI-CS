The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Number game stumps cops
                                                                                                               Number game stumps cops
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The blueprint for the crackdown on banned commercial vehicles remained hazy on Monday with neither police nor the transport department taking the initiative to clear the confusion over the number of vehicles that must go off the road on August 1.        
	The numbers collated by the cops of the 28 categories of commercial vehicles registered before January 1993 do not tally with the corresponding figures provided by the transport department and its wing, the public vehicles department (PVD).         
	The transport department figures suggest 6,293 metered taxis are supposed to go off the road on August 1, while the PVD claims the figure is around 4,600. The taxi unions on the other hand have claimed that the number is between 3,500 and 4,000, said a senior officer of traffic police, illustrating the problem.        
	And its not just taxis. Figures from the three sources for every category of vehicle, including minibuses, lorries, tractors and autorickshaws, are divergent.        
	There are over 250 autos plying in the city that have the same number plates and we cannot trace them. Our bosses are confused and no one wants to delve deep into this number game, said another officer.         
	The policemen are more concerned about possible law and order problems during crackdown than about keeping banned vehicles off the road after the July 31 deadline.        
	We believe there will be violence once the crackdown begins. Many vehicle owners may go off the road and force others to do the same, said an officer.        
	The union members are pinning their hopes on the apex court.        
	The Banijyik Paribahan Bancho Samity (the umbrella body of transport operators) will file a petition in the Supreme Court on Tuesday. We hope to get justice, said Swarnakamal Saha, the secretary of the Bengal Bus Syndicate.

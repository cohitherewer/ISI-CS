The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Gujarati traders flee abductors
                                                                                                               Gujarati traders flee abductors
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The two Rajkot traders, who on Sunday morning fled the mud house in a South 24-Parganas village where they were held captive for six days, were lured with the promise of a piece of metal believed to have magical powers.         
	Ninjibhai Pansuria, 50, and Haji Jalaluddin Ansari, in his late-50s, slipped out through a window and ran to the policemen who had surrounded the house.        
	The cops zeroed in on the house in Banstala, about 45km from Calcutta, by tracking Pansurias cellphone conversation with his family members, said detective chief Jawed Shamim.         
	Pansurias family members had by then sent Rs 5 lakh to one of his acquaintances in the city for paying ransom to the abductors. The acquaintance, an Amherst Street resident named Abhinav, is absconding.        
	Pansuria and Ansari had reached the city on January 25 and put up in a guest house on Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road. Pansuria had come to meet some acquaintances while Ansari was looking for the magic metal.        
	Amit Roy, alias Ratan, called Pansuria the same day, claiming that he had got his phone number from Abhinav, whom the trader knew from Gujarat. Roy invited the two to visit Banstala to take a look at a piece of metal that had the magical powers.        
	Roy and his uncle Sukumar Mondal accompanied the traders to Banstala on Republic Day. After reaching Wahab Mollahs mud house, Roy and Mondal disappeared to take a bath before touching the metal.        
	Wahab and his nephew allegedly held the traders hostage at gunpoint and made Pansuria call up his son Kailash in Rajkot, asking him to pay Rs 5 lakh as ransom.        
	After Abhinav disappeared with the money, the abductors sought Rs 10 lakh from the family. Pansurias family informed the local police on January 29. We received a message from Gujarat police and started tracking the traders cellphone. We located the house and decided to mount a rescue operation. Kailash called up his father and told him in Gujarati, which the abductors did not understand, about our plan, said Shamim.        
	As the cops surrounded the house before daybreak, the traders climbed out through a first-floor window that did not have bars and ran to safety. Roy and Mondal were arrested but Wahab and his nephew escaped.        
	The cops are also looking for Abhinav, who is originally from Kalyani. We are yet to ascertain whether he was a member of the gang, said the detective chief.

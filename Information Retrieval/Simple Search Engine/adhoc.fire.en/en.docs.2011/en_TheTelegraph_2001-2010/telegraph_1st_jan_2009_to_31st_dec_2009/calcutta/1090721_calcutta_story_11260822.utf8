          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A youth arrested for allegedly peddling ganja fled from police custody while being produced in a Howrah court on Monday. Three constables were suspended for alleged dereliction of duty.        
	The cops took Sheikh Raj alias Raj Ansari alias Malo to the third additional district judges court around 2.45pm. According to police, since the hearing of another case was going on, the constables were waiting with Raj near the door of the court, when he started sprinting down the corridor.        
	With the cops on his trail, the 24-year-old crossed Biplabi Haren Ghosh Sarani and proceeded towards Howrah Maidan before running up Bankim Setu and hopping on to a bus.        
	Biplab Mitra, an advocate in the court, said: I was speaking to a client when I saw a youth in a green T-shirt and lungi running down the corridor, followed by three policemen. The youth crossed the gate and ran left.        
	According to him, the constables were chasing Raj silently. If they had raised an alarm, others would have caught the accused.        
	Raj, a resident of Bhotbagan in Bally, was arrested in Thakurani Chawk, also in Bally, on Sunday night. Two-and-a-half kg of ganja was found on him.        
	Eight to nine cases were pending against Raj, said an officer of Bally police station.        
	Niraj Kumar Singh, the superintendent of Howrah police, said: Three constables were suspended on the charge of dereliction of duty. I have asked the additional superintendent of police (town) to investigate the incident. Besides, there will a departmental inquiry. I have asked for a report within a week.

                                                                                                               10 held for campus violence
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Ten students of Netaji Subhas Engineering College in Garia were arrested late on Thursday on the charge of vandalism on campus.        
	The students, who alleged they had been assaulted by police, were produced in a Baruipur court on Friday morning and granted bail.        
	On Thursday morning, around 500 students of the college, run by the Techno India Group, held a sit-in outside the office of director Hrishikesh Mondol, demanding a hostel and better placements, faculty and infrastructure.        
	College officials said the students destroyed campus property and damaged cars, prompting the authorities to call in the police. The students didnt let the director and the teachers leave the campus, said a college official.         
	Senior police officers, including the additional superintendent (industrial) of South 24-Parganas police, S.K. Chowdhry, asked the students to call off the agitation but they allegedly didnt relent.        
	According to students, RAF personnel entered the college at 11.30pm and freed the director and the teachers. Then the police closed the two gates on campus and lathicharged us indiscriminately, said a fourth-year student. He said 12 students were injured and admitted to hospital.        
	The police denied the allegation.        
	The institute director denied that the college infrastructure was bad or the placements were poor.         
	The real issue was attendance. According to university rules, a student needs at least 75 per cent attendance to sit for the semester exams, said Mondol. A number of students had below 10 per cent attendance but they demanded that they be allowed to write the exam. When I refused, they turned violent.

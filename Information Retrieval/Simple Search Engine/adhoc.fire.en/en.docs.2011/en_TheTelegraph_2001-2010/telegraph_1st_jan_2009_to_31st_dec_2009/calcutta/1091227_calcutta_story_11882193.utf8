The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bangla bats for hot spot
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Bangla bats for hot spot
                              Devastation caused by cyclone Aila on the Indian part of the Sunderbans. A Telegraph picture                            
	Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina made a strong case for preserving the Sunderbans at the Copenhagen climate summit while the Indian delegation was all but silent on the region whose well-being is vital for Calcuttas survival.        
	Salinity intrusions are threatening the worlds largest mangrove forest, the Sunderbans, a Unesco world heritage site, said Hasina in an impassioned speech in front of world leaders.        
	She referred to the sea level rise because of climate change and the displacement of local people.        
	The Indian part of the Sunderbans recorded the highest sea-level rise in the country (more than 3mm in a year). Many in the region lost their livelihood in the cyclone, Aila, and migrated to Calcutta, putting pressure on the already stressed city.        
	Indian environment minister Jairam Ramesh mentioned the Sunderbans only while justifying the countrys claim for a global climate adaptation fund in response to an observation by developed countries that India does not need such a fund.        
	Though India officially did not make a case out of the Sunderbans, the NGOs have been highlighting the issue.         
	Why should the Sunderbans, which has one of the smallest carbon footprints, suffer because of the deeds of developed countries and why havent these countries supported the cause of the unique habitat? an exhibition set up by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) posed this question at Klimaforum, an alternate point of convergence at the Copenhagen summit.        
	Apart from using photographs and video footage, I made installations with sandbags to showcase Sunderbans vulnerability. Nearly half a million residents are forced to hide behind the sandbags to survive storms, floods and other natural calamities, said Pradip Saha of the CSE, who put together the exhibition.        
	Back home, a platform of green NGOs, Sabuj Mancha, has written to the United Nations Framework Convention of Climate Change demanding that the effort to protect the Sunderbans should begin at the earliest and a regional blueprint involving both India and Bangladesh be drawn up.

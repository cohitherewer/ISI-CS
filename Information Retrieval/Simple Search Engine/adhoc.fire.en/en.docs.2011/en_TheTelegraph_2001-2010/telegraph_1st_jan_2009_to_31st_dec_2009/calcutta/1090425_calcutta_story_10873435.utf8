	A special Howrah-Burdwan passenger train has derailed near Dankuni east cabin between 5.10pm and 5.15pm. Several passengers are reported to be injured.        
	The message from Dankuni station stirred the Howrah division control room of Eastern Railway into action on Friday afternoon. An SOS was sent to the emergency control at the railway headquarters and an accident relief train started for Dankuni.         
	Only after reaching the goods train yard in Dankuni did the 100-odd medical and relief personnel on board learn that it was a drill to check the their alertness.         
	This is the biggest disaster management drill in recent years. We simulated both derailment and collision, said Mohammad Jamshed, the divisional railway manager of Howrah.        
	We are planning a security drill involving Border Security Force, Railway Protection Force, army, fire brigade and police at Howrah station soon, he added.         
	As the accident relief train halted near the simulator coach, relief personnel with stretchers jumped off. Within six minutes, they cut the window rods to enter the coach and rescue the passengers  railway employees pretending to be injured.         
	Satellite phones and other communication equipment were installed and a temporary relief camp set up.         
	The relief workers used cool cutters and not welding machines since there were supposed to be passengers inside, said Jamshed.        
	Later, a hydraulic jack was used to put the coach back on the track. A crane of 140-tonne capacity also arrived for the drill which went on till late in the evening.        
	We were informed about the accident. I thought it was a real one and rushed here, said Sanjay Kunga, the officer-in-charge of Belur government railway police station.

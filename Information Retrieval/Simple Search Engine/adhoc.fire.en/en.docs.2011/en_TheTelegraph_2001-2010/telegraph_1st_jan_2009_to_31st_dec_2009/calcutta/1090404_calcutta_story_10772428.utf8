              Sanchita Bhattacharya Sreeradha Bandyopadhyay Nachiketa        Tribute to motherhood                    The idea of motherhood is synonymous with that of nourishing, nurturing and love. A mother is the giver of life. It is she who plays out the miracle of creation. She helps her offspring grow; she teaches, punishes and comforts. Nature, the fountainhead of all living beings, is also considered a mother. Mother Nature bears, feeds and sustains us, making life possible. The Indian ethos also gives the country the identity of a mother. The very word motherland bears with it connotations of sacrifice and protection ... Janani janmabhoomischa sargadapi gariashi (Bankimchandra Chattopadhyay). Hindu ideology is also based on the concept of the goddess as a mother figure, with goddess Durga being identified as Shakti roopena samsthita. Maa Tujhe Salaam (concept amp; choreography: Sanchita Bhattacharya), this evenings dance presentation, pays tribute to the different facets of motherhood. An Odissi-based choreography presented by Sanchita Bhattacharya and her troupe, it celebrates motherhood in all its forms and manifestations. This will be followed by modern Bengali songs presented by Sreeradha Bandyopadhyay and Nachiketa. Hosted by National Maritime Day Celebration Committee, Calcutta, to commemorate Maritime Day and the sailing of the first Indian merchant ship.                    Event: Programme of music and dance to mark Maritime Day When: Tomorrow at 5.30 pm Where: Vidya Mandir

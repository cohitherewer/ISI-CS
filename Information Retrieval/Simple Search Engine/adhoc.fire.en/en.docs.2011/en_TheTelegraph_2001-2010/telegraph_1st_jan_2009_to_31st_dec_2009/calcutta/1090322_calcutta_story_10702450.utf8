                                                                                                               Trigonomatried and masonaried
                                        The Trigonometrical Survey tower next to the Paikpara Rajbati. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                            
	Isnt being trigonometrical enough? Paikpara Rajbati may have been decimated, but even after an apartment block came up in its place, it is still easily identifiable. Standing next to it is the Great Trigonometrical Survey tower, whitewashed of late, with the giant letters PWD, for the public works department, painted on it in black. But there is more interesting lettering.         
	The second tower on the same road, that is Barrackpore Trunk Road, is at Sukhchar near Sodepur, many stops away. Sukhchar is where Hastings had built a retreat, and so did Barretto, the banker after whom an alley connecting Mangoe Lane and British Indian Street is still named.         
	There used to be a chapel at Sukhchar, and it is not clear whether the current name of this neighbourhood  Sukhchar Girja  is in memory of that place of worship, or whether it refers to the white tower constructed there.        
	To return to the Paikpara tower, some government organisation  either the PWD or the Calcutta Municipal Corporation  had the bright idea of enlightening the public about the origin.         
	Local people had no idea about its purpose and they used to call it Lalababur Girja or Lalababus church, the babu being one of the Paikpara zamindars, who gained mythopoeic status in Bengal. No doubt, this move is well-intentioned, but, as they say, the path to hell is paved with good intentions.        
	For, while the snippet of information on the tower recently painted on it may be of interest to those who are enthusiastic about Calcuttas history, it also proves beyond doubt the ignorance of those responsible for it. It begins with a mistake that is repeated all over. The perpetrators should have consulted the dictionary before writing about anything close to trigonometry. Not only have they misspelt the word, they have the temerity of coining a word inspired by it. Neither Google nor any dictionary yielded a word close to trigonomatried repeated twice here. The current standard of education in Bengal is nothing to boast about. But even we dont deserve such pearls of wisdom.         
	Single in a theatre        
	A film show is on at a multiplex. It is the morning show and there are few people. A film reviewer, a woman in her mid-20s, sat munching on cheese popcorn and making notes of what she did not like about the film she was reviewing. She was alone. But would not be for long.         
	A young man in his 20s walked up to her abruptly and flung this proposition: Excuse me, can I have your company for a while? She couldnt actually believe her ears and asked him to repeat himself. When he did so, all that this lady could come up with was a rude No.         
	The lady felt very sad. It is one thing to be approached by someone when you are at a nightclub. It can sometimes make a womans  or a mans  day, if the approach taken is right. But watching a movie alone is a lovely way of being with yourself and the popcorn. And no one else. But if men on the prowl dont respect that, women lose out on one of their hard-earned pleasures.

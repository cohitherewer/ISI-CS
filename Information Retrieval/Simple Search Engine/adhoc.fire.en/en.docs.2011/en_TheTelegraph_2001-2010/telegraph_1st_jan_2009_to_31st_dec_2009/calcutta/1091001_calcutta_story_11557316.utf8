The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Top cop rap for officers
                                                                                                               Top cop rap for officers

	The police commissioner has come down heavily on the officers-in-charge (OCs) of the 48 police stations for non-performance.         
	A circular (15696/Spl. CP(I), dated 15.09.09) signed by special commissioner R.K. Pachnanda, a copy of which is with Metro, conveyed Gautam Mohan Chakrabartis observations regarding lapses at the police station level and urged the officers-in-charge to pull up their socks.        
	The circular, which was initially sent to the deputy commissioners, states that many OCs do not have adequate control over the areas under their jurisdiction and hence do not undertake anti-crime measures.        
	A senior officer said the police chief felt the OCs were ignoring traffic management on city roads as a result of which rash driving had become rampant. Police stations have to supplement the work of the traffic cops regarding traffic violations, illegal parking and rash driving. This should be done early in the morning as well as in the evening, states the circular.        
	According to the circular, action must be taken against rowdies, eve-teasers and motorcyclists without helmet.        
	The top cop also wants OCs to move around in their areas and not remain confined to police stations. Instead of reactive and mechanical policing we should do pro-active policing.        
	Pachnanda was not available for comment. A deputy commissioner confirmed receipt of the circular and said the OCs had been asked to immediately take the steps suggested by the commissioner.         
	The deputy commissioners were asked to look into complaints that OCs were not accessible to common citizens. We are flooded with such complaints, said the deputy commissioner.        
	The circular directs officers to hold Jana Sanjog Sabhas in slums and residential colonies so that the public attendance is maximum. Deputy commissioners and OCs of traffic guards have been asked to attend the interfaces.

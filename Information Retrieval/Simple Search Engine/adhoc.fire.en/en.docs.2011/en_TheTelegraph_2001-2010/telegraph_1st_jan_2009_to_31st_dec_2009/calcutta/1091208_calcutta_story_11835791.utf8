                      Rhythm of life                    The pioneer of modern dance in India, Uday Shankar is known for adapting Western theatrical techniques to traditional Indian classical dance. Though he didnt have any formal training in any of the Indian classical dance forms, his presentations were exceptionally creative. His style blends Western forms with elements of Indian classical, folk and tribal dance, laying the roots of modern Indian dance. He popularised this form in India, Europe and the United States in 1920s and 1930s, effectively placing Indian dance on the world map. To mark his birth anniversary today, West Bengal State Music Academy, department of Information and Cultural Affairs, Government of West Bengal, EZCC and West Bengal Dance Group Federation host the seven-day Uday Shankar Dance Festival 2009. To be inaugurated this evening at 5.30 by Vempatty Chinnasatyam, todays programme features a presentation by participants of a workshop on the Uday Shankar style of dance; Kartikeya by Shanti Bose; Kuchipudi by Srimayi Vempatty (Chennai); Kathak by Anuj Misra (Lucknow); and performances by Manipuri Nartanalaya (dir: Bimbavati Devi) and Sahana (Mumbai) at Rabindra Sadan.

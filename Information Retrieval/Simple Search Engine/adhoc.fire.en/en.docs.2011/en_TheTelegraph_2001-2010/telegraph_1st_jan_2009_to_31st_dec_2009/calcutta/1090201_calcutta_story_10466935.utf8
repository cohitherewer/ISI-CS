	Prafulla Chandra Sorcar could have made himself known as P.C. Sorcar, picked up the wand and made a living as the eldest son of the legendary magician. But he chose to get on with a different name Manick; in a different land America; and with a different craft  laser animation.        
	Based in Denver, Colorado, Manick Sorcar is the CEO of Sorcar Engineering by day, working on projects like lighting design for Denver International Airport concourses, sports centres in Japan and palaces of Saudi princes. By night, he transforms into cartoonist, animator and laserist.        
	Calcutta has seen his work at Nandan in 2000 as part of World Bengali Conference when he displayed tales from Panchatantra in laser art. In 2003, he presented an animated film based on Sukumar Roys Ekushe Ain and in 2005, he rolled out a 30-minute extravaganza of graphics, animation and 3-D laser magic based on childrens songs at Nicco Park.         
	The US has seen a lot more  earning him a plethora of awards, including multiple International Laser Display Association crowns. Its the Oscar for us, laserists, Sorcar said, sitting in Indrajaal, his fathers Ballygunge abode.        
	This winter he has come to Calcutta with a book  on himself. Written by Roma Dhar, it is a sketchbook where each facet of Sorcars personality is illustrated with photographs, newspaper cuttings and his own creations, be it cartoons, collages, storyboards, and pictures of crowning moments.

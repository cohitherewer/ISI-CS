	Mobile handsets worth Rs 18 lakh were stolen from an outlet of a cellphone retail chain at the Lenin Sarani-Madan Street crossing on Sunday.        
	Police said the theft was one of the biggest in recent times. We have started an investigation. It looks like the criminals made a detailed study of the building before entering the store. We are interrogating the 20-odd shop employees to see whether they had any role to play in the crime, said a senior officer of Bowbazar police station.        
	According to the shopowner, 230 high-end mobile handsets and Rs 30,000 were missing from the 7,000sq ft ground-floor showroom that also houses a furniture section. We had downed shutters at 10pm on Saturday and the store was closed on Sunday. The theft was discovered at 10.10am on Monday when my younger brother Azhar opened the store and found empty cellphone packets scattered, said Asif Feroz, the shopowner.        
	He said the thieves did not break a single lock in the store, which was inaugurated in January. They possibly climbed a tree adjacent to the building and landed on the first-floor balcony of the building, which houses a computer training institute, and sneaked in by breaking the iron grille. They then entered the institute and broke the locks of two doors. They ripped a wooden board off a wall that led to the second- floor staircase of the cellphone store and climbed in, said Feroz. The police said they had found some fingerprints on the landing.        
	The police suspect a professional gang, helped by insiders, was behind the theft.         
	Outsiders would not have known the route used by the thieves to enter the store. Some carpenters who had worked in the building during its renovation last year may have tipped off the gang. The thieves came prepared with screwdrivers, hammers and a chisel, which they have left behind, said an officer.        
	The thieves did not touch the institutes laptop or the computers at the store. They just took away the cellphones and batteries, he added.        
	House burgled: A resident of Dover Terrace in Gariahat lodged a police complaint that Rs 3,500 and ornaments worth Rs 10,000 were stolen from his house early on Monday.         
	Bhaskar Banerjee said the thieves had probably sprayed some chemicals inside the rooms and broke open the lock of the back door to enter the house. They broke the locks of the iron safe and decamped with the booty, he added.

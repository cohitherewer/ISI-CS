The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sinking baby hearts revived
                                                                                                               Sinking baby hearts revived
          SUBHRO SAHA                           The babies with their mothers after the surgeries at the Bypass hospital                                  
	A congenital heart condition, life-threatening if not corrected within days of birth, was reversed through a rare surgery performed back-to-back in a city hospital, giving two babies a new lease of life.        
	The baby boys, both extremely blue and sick from transposition of great arteries (TGA), were saved using the complex arterial switch operation performed at the Rabindranath Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences.         
	In TGA, accounting for five per cent of congenital heart diseases, the two main blood vessels that carry blood from the heart, aorta and the pulmonary artery are formed in a position opposite from where they should be, said Mrinalendu Das, a consultant cardiac surgeon at the Mukundapur hospital, who led the team that performed the twin procedures.        
	In a normal heart, the aorta arises from the left ventricle and pumps red or oxygen-rich blood into the body. The pulmonary artery arises from the right ventricle, pumping blue or un-oxygenated blood to the lungs.        
	In TGA, the roles of the vessels are reversed and the body receives blue blood instead of red that it needs. So the baby becomes sick and blue. The lungs receive the oxygenated blood, which is not needed. The first baby, eight days old, was in shock when brought to the hospital. An echocardiography revealed TGA with ventricular septal defect, a hole between the two lower chambers of the heart allowing some mixing of red and blue blood, thus buying some more time for the child, said Biswajit Bandyopadhyay, the head of the hospitals interventional paediatric cardiology department.        
	The infant was prepared for surgery by opening the ductus connecting the aorta with the pulmonary artery through an injection, thus facilitating some more blue-red mixing. The arterial switch surgery, rare in this part of the country, was performed four days later.        
	The aorta and pulmonary artery were transected above the valves, moved to the correct position and sewn in place.        
	The same arterial switch operation was performed on the second child, too. Both the babies made a satisfactory recovery, said P.S. Bhattacharya, a consultant paediatric intensivist, part of the doctors team.        
	After total correction, the prognosis is usually good and these infants should grow up to lead a perfectly normal life, said Amitabha Chattopadhyay, a consultant paediatric cardiologist who was also part of the treatment team.

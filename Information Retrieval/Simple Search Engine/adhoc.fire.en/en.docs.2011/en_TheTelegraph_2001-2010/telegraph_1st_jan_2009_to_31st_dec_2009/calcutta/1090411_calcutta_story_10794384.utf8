The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Police safety net for aged
                                                                                                               Police safety net for aged
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Police are in the process of tying up with NGOs to offer elderly Calcuttans, especially those living alone, a security net.         
	Under the proposed scheme, each police station will collect information on aged individuals or couples living by themselves in the area under its jurisdiction. An officer along with a representative of an NGO will visit the elderly regularly.         
	The two would spend time with the aged, try to find out if they need food and medicine, and check the condition of the house or flat. Senior officers at Lalbazar held preliminary talks with several NGOs and will meet this week to work out the details of the security net.        
	Lalbazar is calling the support system beat policing, which is along the lines of community policing in England.        
	About a year back, a similar drive was launched at Lake police station. The project did not take off with senior citizens shying away from cops. However, we want to put in place a system where the aged can fall back on cops in a crisis, said a senior officer.        
	Crimes against senior citizens prompted Calcutta police to publish an advisory, Safety Steps for Senior Citizens, earlier this year. The officers-in-charge of the 48 police stations were asked to circulate the document among the elderly.        
	We are concerned about the security of senior citizens and hope to start the new scheme soon, said additional police commissioner R.K. Pachnanda.

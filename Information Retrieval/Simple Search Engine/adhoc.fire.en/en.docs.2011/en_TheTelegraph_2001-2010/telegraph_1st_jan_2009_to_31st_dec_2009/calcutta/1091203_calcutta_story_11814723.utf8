The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Foetus outside hospital
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Foetus outside hospital
          A STAFF REPORTER                           The vat where the foetuses were allegedly dumped. (Sanat Kumar Sinha)                                  
	A human foetus that had been nibbled on was found on the Lee Road footpath adjoining Sambhunath Pandit Hospital on Wednesday.        
	Residents alleged it was one of two foetuses dumped in a vat inside the hospital around 11am. Dogs dragged the foetuses outside and nibbled at them. The other foetus was carried away by a dog when residents chased it.         
	A group of residents later demonstrated in the hospital, prompting police to rush to the spot and send the foetus for a post-mortem.         
	A partially nibbled foetus was found on the footpath along the hospital. We cannot say anything more unless a post-mortem is done, said an officer of Bhowanipore police station. Three dogs were feeding on the foetuses. When we tried to scare them away, a dog fled with the remains of a foetus, said a resident.         
	A police source told Metro that when officers took the foetus to the emergency section, the attending doctors said it was aborted.        
	Tarun Kanti Manna, the superintendent of the hospital, said the hospital was not connected with the incident.         
	There were no premature deliveries in our hospital today. We have to wait for the post-mortem report to confirm whether it was a foetus or a newborn baby or a stillborn baby, he said.         
	According to Manna, it is not possible for the hospital authorities to stop people from throwing things into the dump.

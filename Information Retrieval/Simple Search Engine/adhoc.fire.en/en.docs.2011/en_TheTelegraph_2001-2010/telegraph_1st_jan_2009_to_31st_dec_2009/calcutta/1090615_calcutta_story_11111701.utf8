	Rain brought relief to the city at night after oppressive heat and humidity throughout Sunday. The weatherman predicted thunderstorms in the next 24 hours though the monsoon current is still weak.        
	On Sunday, the mercury touched 36.5 degree Celsius, three points above normal. The minimum humidity was 56 per cent, above the normal range of 40-45 per cent for this time of the year.        
	The discomfort index was 64 degree Celsius, nine points above normal. Mondays temperature is likely to range between 36 degree and 29 degree Celsius.         
	The rain broke a seven-day dry spell but is unlikely to continue. The monsoon flow will be activated only after a few days. The relief from thunderstorms is only temporary, warned the weatherman.        
	Power cuts, however, are likely to return with the Budge Budge plant operating below capacity.        
	We expect 80MW to 100MW shortfall during the evening peak hours on Monday and power cuts cannot be avoided, said a CESC official.        
	The power utility plans to shut down its 250MW unit at Budge Budge, which had collapsed last Tuesday plunging the city into darkness, for about five hours at night to fit a few carbon brush slip rings that were burnt.        
	We will replace the slip rings between Monday midnight and 5am on Tuesday and start the unit again. Since demand will be low during the period, we dont expect power cuts, said a CESC official.        
	The Budge Budge unit is generating about 120MW now. It is expected to generate about 200MW after replacement of spares, added the official.        
	Thunderstorms could keep the demand low till then. The weatherman said conditions are conducive to thunderstorms because of incursion of adequate moisture in the lower troposphere and the waning of the dry, hot northwesterly flow over Bengal.        
	The high incursion of moisture in the lower troposphere is taking place because of southerlies and southwesterlies blowing in over south Bengal from the Bay of Bengal, said a Met official.        
	The hot, dry northwesterly flow has eased, which is allowing the moisture to rise to the upper troposphere, thus aiding the formation of thunderclouds, he added.

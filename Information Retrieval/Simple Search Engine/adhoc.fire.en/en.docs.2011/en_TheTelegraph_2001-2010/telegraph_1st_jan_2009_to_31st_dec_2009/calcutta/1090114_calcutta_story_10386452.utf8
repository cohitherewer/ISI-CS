The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Now, hear it from the koel of Kalighat
                                                                                                               Now, hear it from the koel of Kalighat
  - Mamata launches into patriotic song on reality show stage, adds feather to culture cap           SUDESHNA BANERJEE                          Mamata Banerjee sings Ay mere watan ke logon at City Centre on Tuesday. Picture by Pradip Sanyal                                        
	M for Mamata. M for music. It was tough to tell the good M from the bad M when Mamata Banerjee broke into Ay mere watan ke logon on a reality show stage at City Centre on Tuesday evening.        
	Though Mamatas visit was scheduled, the music wasnt at the Sa Re Ga Ma Pa show. The Trinamul Congress leader was taken aback when anchor Aditya Narayan, after hailing her artistic abilities with pen and paintbrush, urged her to sing.        
	Loyalists like Madan Mitra and Sudip Bandyopadhyay in the audience held their breath as Mamata started off: Hum gaatey nahin hain, bhaashan dete hain. Pehley gaatey thhe. I know Rabindrasangeet. But voice abhi choke hai. But by then, the crowd egged on by Aditya would not take no for an answer from Bengals allrounder number one.        
	She warmed up with Bengal mein sangeet ka janam hota hai. Music mein bhi hum desh ko yaad karte hain before launching into Ay mere watan ke logon, Lata Mangeshkars tribute to martyrs in the 1962 Sino-Indian War. A few notes might have made Lata squirm but Mamata stuck to the tune in the main. As the latest talent unearthed by the talent show circus went silent amidst a shower of confetti, the audience broke into applause and her supporters went berserk. Ki choice! Ki voice, one yelled.        
	Before laying claim to the crown of koel of Kalighat, the nemesis of Nano sat sombrely through two songs by Soumen Nandi, a Sodepur boy who is one of the Zee TV shows finalists, and obliged autograph hunters. As Aditya Narayan walked on stage, Mamata turned to Sudip and asked Chheleta ke? Within minutes, she was invited up by the youth she now knew as Udit Narayans son.        
	Before she switched to verse, the words she spouted bordered on the poetic. Morning is for high hope, afternoon is for fame, evening is for vision and night is for no tension, only relaxation, smiled Mamata. It was 7.22pm when she paid her almost-tuneful tribute to the countrys shahid, so was it vision or relaxation? It was certainly neither for Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who could lose his culture czar of Calcutta crown one fine morning to an unlikely contender.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Right to lawlessness   Police bow to 3-wheel threat
                                                                                                               Right to lawlessness   Police bow to 3-wheel threat
  - Auto menace paralyses traffic and police          A STAFF REPORTER                          A handful of autos and hundreds of drivers blocked Bridge No. 4 on Monday morning to protest the drive against errant three-wheelers. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                        
	Somebody please tell them to clear the road. My husband will die, cried Sumana Khatun. Her husband lay still inside a stationary ambulance on the AJC Bose flyover as autorickshaws brought Monday morning traffic to a dead halt.        
	Sumanas husband, a trader, had suffered a cerebral stroke a few hours back in Burdwan and was being rushed from SSKM to MR Bangur hospital for treatment, till the auto army struck.        
	From 10.30am to noon on Monday, around 350 auto drivers blocked the Bridge No. 4 connector to the Bypass, paralysing traffic in and around Park Circus.        
	Their demand? The right to remain lawless.        
	Their ally? The cops on duty who remained silent spectators  we are under instructions not to use force as this is election time, said one, on condition of anonymity.        
	The cops are booking us for overloading when we take more than four passengers. We have been taking five-six passengers for a long time but never before have we been booked. We demand that the cops stop this drive, said Sheikh Rumi, an auto driver on the Topsia route.        
	Rumi and gang were railing against the drive launched on Thursday to book autos flouting the four-passenger rule. Police sources said the crackdown was launched after a senior officer noticed a number of autos near Park Circus last Wednesday flouting the four-passenger rule. From Thursday, overloaded autos were being booked and fined Rs 3,000.        
	By evening, word trickled out that the police would suspend the drive against errant autos till the polls ended, though the Lalbazar bosses denied such a climbdown and insisted all vehicles flouting traffic rules would be booked.        
	They should try convincing some of the commuters caught in the traffic jam at high noon. This is absolute hooliganism. How can the autos just block roads demanding that they be allowed to flout traffic rules and how can the cops allow them to get away with it? demanded Abhisek Chakraborty, stuck at Park Circus en route to his Sector V office.                          
	Around 10.30am on Monday, a handful of autos blocked the vital connector and started protesting police atrocity. Within no time they had achieved their objective  minimum effort, maximum impact.        
	As vehicles started queueing up from the Bypass Connector to AJC Bose Road, policemen watched with hands in their pockets.        
	My child is suffering from dehydration and needs to go home but these men are not allowing our car to move, cried Sangita Bansal, a resident of Picnic Garden, clutching on to her little daughter in school uniform in a taxi.        
	Such pleas were drowned in the din of protests by raging auto drivers. The blockade was finally lifted after the deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Dilip Bandopadhyay arrived at the spot and assured the protesters that their demands would be looked into.        
	The drivers had a few complaints regarding alleged police atrocities and illegal parking along the road. We will look into the matter, said Bandopadhyay.        
	Around 10.30am on Monday, a handful of autos blocked the vital connector and started protesting police atrocity. Within no time they had achieved their objective  minimum effort, maximum impact.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fee fight at crisis crossroads
                                                                                                               Fee fight at crisis crossroads
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        
	The face-off over fee hike in private schools is fast snowballing into a crisis, with the authorities turning down the parents demand for a rollback and even threatening to close down the institutions if the stalemate continues.        
	Almost all private schools have increased their fees by 50 to 80 per cent  the highest in recent times  triggering a series of protests by parents across the city.         
	The hike followed the governments decision to implement the fifth pay commissions recommendation for a salary hike for its employees, including those working in state-aided schools. The rules state that all private schools have to pay their employees on a par with aided schools.        
	We may have to close down the schools if such protests continue, said Father Moloy D Costa, the education officer of all city schools under the Roman Catholic church.        
	Some people are refusing to understand that we are being forced to raise the fees to pay our teachers and other employees as the pay panel has suggested, DCosta added.        
	The schools are claiming that the hike in fees is proportional to their increased expenditure on salaries. The starting salary of a trained graduate teacher has increased by around 60 per cent, from Rs 11,050 to Rs 17,000. We have no option but to raise the extra money through a fee hike, said the principal of a reputed city school.        
	The parents, however, are not buying the managements line, with a section demanding that the hike be kept moderate and be implemented in phases.        
	Everyone is feeling the downturn pinch. The schools decision to almost double their fees has only added to the burden on salaried people like us, said a worried father of two sons, who study in private schools that have raised their fees by more than 60 per cent and also hiked the school bus, laboratory and library charges.        
	On Wednesday, the parents of students of several schools  including Loyola High School, St Anthonys School, Patha Bhavan and St Aloysius (Howrah)  organised protests, demanding a rollback.        
	The entire process of the hike is not transparent The authorities could have shared details of their increased expenditure with the parents, said Faiz Alam, the general secretary of the parents association of St Anthonys School.        
	Several parents are demanding state intervention to resolve the deadlock.        
	Though many of the private schools get a part of the dearness allowance paid to their employees from the state coffers, the government has no say in their administration.        
	Private schools, particularly the ones run by minorities such as Christian missionaries, enjoy academic and financial freedom.The government could have tried to arbitrate but for the approaching Lok Sabha polls. Now, we have to play a neutral role, said an official in the school education department.        
	But sensing an opportunity to gain some mileage before the polls, some political parties are rallying around the protesting parents, prompting the school authorities to announce that they would not discuss the issue with outsiders.        
	In many cases, the protesters are outsiders. We wont talk to them, said Herod Mullick, the general secretary of Bangiya Christiya Pariseba.

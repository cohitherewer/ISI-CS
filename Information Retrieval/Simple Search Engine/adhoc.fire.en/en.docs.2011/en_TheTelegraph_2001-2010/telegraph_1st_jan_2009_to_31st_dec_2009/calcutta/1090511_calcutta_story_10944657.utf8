The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Climate plan promise
                                                                                                               Climate plan promise

	The state government will come up with a time-bound plan after the elections to implement the national climate action policy, chief secretary Ashok Mohan Chakrabarti has declared.         
	The climate change concerns need to be addressed immediately, Chakrabarti said at a recent seminar on Climate Change and West Bengal: Vulnerability and Adaptation Options at the state pollution control board office in Salt Lake.        
	The chief minister was supposed to inaugurate the programme but did not turn up.        
	The chief secretary claimed government departments would work in unison, with support from scientists and academicians, in areas like solar energy, enhanced energy efficiency, urban development, especially in devising climate-friendly building codes and increasing green cover.        
	The departments of science and technology, and environment will organise a follow-up meeting after about six weeks with all the departments and agencies concerned to finalise an integrated time-bound action plan after the elections, he added.        
	We have a climate cell under the chief ministers chairmanship and projects are being pursued on the vulnerability of the Sunderbans and the city to climate change and also on integrated coastal zone management in the state. Two of the projects are funded by the World Bank, said environment secretary M.L. Meena.        
	Calcutta is among the cities most vulnerable to climate change. The state pollution control board chairman sought more data to understand the possible impact of climate change on the state.        
	Experts from outside, such as N.H. Rabindranath of Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, and H. Pathak of New Delhi-based Indian Agriculture Research Institute, provided evidence to establish the vulnerability of Bengal to climate change.

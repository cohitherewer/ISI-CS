The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Spinster found dead in house
                                                                                                               Spinster found dead in house
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 43-year-old spinster who lived alone was found dead on Wednesday in a two-storeyed Behala house that was locked from outside.        
	Police found Soma Bhattacharyas decomposed body after breaking open the front door to 71 Unique Park, based on a complaint from neighbours about a foul smell emanating from the house.        
	She may have died at least two days ago. We have started a murder investigation, M. Jain, the additional superintendent of police (headquarters) of South 24-Parganas, told Metro.        
	An investigating officer said the primary reason for suspecting murder was that the house was locked from outside. We are awaiting the post-mortem report to know the exact cause of death.         
	Some neighbours fuelled the conspiracy theory by alleging that Soma used to have regular visitors in the evening and that she may have been involved in illegal activities.        
	The police brought in one of Somas two married sisters, Roma, for interrogation after a neighbour claimed to have seen her husband loitering in the area on Monday.        
	He came to my shop to buy a packet of gutkha and asked me about Somas whereabouts. I asked him to go to the house and find out for himself. But he got into an autorickshaw instead and left. I gave this piece of information to the police, too, said Buddhadeb Nayek, who owns a paan kiosk next to 71 Unique Park.        
	Roma and her husband are residents of Roy Bahadur Road, in Behala, and would often visit Soma, neighbours said. The eldest of the sisters, Manju, is based in Assam.        
	Some residents of the locality said they had complained to the police about illegal activity in Somas house but no action was taken.        
	Some residents had alerted Behala police station to what was going on in that house, said Chittho Sarkar, a neighbour.        
	Sarkar last saw Soma on Sunday night. She was talking to a woman outside her house. She never interacted much with the other residents, he said.

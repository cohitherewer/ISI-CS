The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Varsities draw up plan to prevent ragging
                                                                                                               Varsities draw up plan to prevent ragging
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Jadavpur University and the Bengal Engineering and Science University have announced a string of measures to ensure that first-year students are not ragged once classes begin this month.        
	There will be intense vigil on the entire campus and the hostels to ensure that there is not a single incident of ragging this year, said Rajat Ray, the dean of students affairs at JU, where first-year classes start on Monday.         
	Last year, a first-year student of the architecture department was forced to drink, smoke ganja and chew tobacco by her seniors barely a week after classes started.        
	Drawing a lesson from the incident, each department of the university will set up an anti-ragging squad, which will keep vigil in classrooms, adjoining corridors and the building where the department is housed.        
	A separate squad will monitor common areas like canteens, playgrounds and common rooms. Hostels, too, will have their own anti-ragging squads.        
	The departmental squads will be led by the head of the department and consist of at least five teachers and 10 students. It will have to prevent ragging, intervene if there is a complaint and collect evidence to punish the offenders, said Ray.        
	The JU authorities will also brief newcomers on ways to avoid ragging. For instance, they will be handed a list of places on the campus where they are not supposed to loiter alone during the first few months of the session. The freshers have also been given phone numbers of officials they can call to complaint about ragging.         
	At the Besu, where first-year classes are scheduled to begin on July 30, the authorities are trying to prevent violence as well as ragging by stepping up vigil on the campus.        
	There has not been a student clash on the campus for the past six months. We are taking all possible measures to ensure that the campus remains peaceful after the newcomers start classes, said Biman Bandyopadhyay, the registrar of Besu.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | And now, the waters beckon Her
                                                                                                               And now, the waters beckon Her
                            
	A Metro guide to Dashami, bringing the curtains down on Puja 2009.              
	What is visarjan?        
	Visarjan is not just the immersion of the goddess in the Ganga to loud cries of Bolo Durga mai ki jai. It marks the official end of Puja,with the priest removing the ghot on which the pranpratistha was done. A mirror is floated in a pot of water and you can catch a glimpse of the Devis reflection as she departs. The mirror is then upturned and the thread around the four sticks surrounding the ghot broken. The deadline for rituals is either 6.58am or between 8.28am and 9.28am (Gupta Press) and either 7am or between 8.29am and 9.29am (Bisuddhasiddhanta).        
	When is sindur khela?        
	After visarjan, women bid adieu to the Goddess, her children and their mounts with sweets, betel leaf and sindur (for Durga, Saraswati and Lakshmi). This is called boron. After putting sindur on the goddesses, married women smear each other with it. The tradition comes from the Bengali custom where married women would apply sindur on each other when one of them was leaving home.        
	What about bhashan?        
	To complete your Puja experience, brave the crowds and go to Babughat to see the idols being immersed. Keep it safe and keep a firm grip on your kids. Stay away from the water and follow police rules. Dont forget to scream Asche bochhor abar hobe.        
	What about dancing?        
	Today, its cool. Join the para kids in dancing on the road as the idols leave. No tango or salsa steps, just jhatkas and matkas.        
	What to wear?        
	Go traditional for Vijaya, and drape yourself in a Gadwal with a backless patchwork blouse for a night-out. Men, pair textured Jodhpuri pants with a short batik and cutwork bandhgala in khadi.        
	What to eat and drink?        
	Stuff yourself with sweets and snacks from the pronam spree. (Dashami turns dry post-4pm, though not at hotels and clubs.)        
	Where to go?        
	Before going back to the grind on Tuesday, enjoy this day with family and friends.        
	How to go?        
	Drive or be driven around. Otherwise, Metro will ply between 3pm and 9pm (3pm to 6pm, 15-minute intervals and 6pm to 9pm, 10 minutes).        
	Worth a watch:        
	Pretty women in red-bordered white saris looking even prettier after sindur khela.        
	Worth a miss:        
	Cricket talk.

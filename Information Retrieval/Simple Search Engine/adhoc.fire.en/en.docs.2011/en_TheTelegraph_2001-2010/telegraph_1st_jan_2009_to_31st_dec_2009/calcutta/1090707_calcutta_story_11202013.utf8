  - GOATS BEING TRAINED TO GET BEHIND THE WHEEL!          ZEESHAN JAWED                              (Top)Goats take a break from grazing in a room on the deserted premises of the Transport and Traffic Management Training Institute (Below) on Jessore Road on Monday. (Bishwarup Dutta)				                                       
	If the spate of road accidents in the city has got your goat, go visit 56 Jessore Road. The abandoned Transport and Traffic Management Traffic Institute there  meant to be a training ground for errant bus drivers  is now the happy grazing ground for goats (and cows) from the neighbourhood.        
	Almost eight years after it was conceptualised and four years after the work to build the institute had begun, the state of the Rs 20-crore (approx) project is a dead giveaway of why the blood on our streets just refuses to dry.        
	The main objective of the institute was to train bus drivers in order to curb rash driving and reduce the number of road accidents, said a state transport department official.        
	The plan was that once the institute was fully functional it would be mandatory for every bus driver in the city (and gradually the state) to undergo theoretical and practical training here before getting a licence, he added.        
	Today, a sprawling but deserted three-storeyed building with around 15 rooms is all that the institute, to be built in partnership between the central and state governments, has to show for the grand plan.        
	Thanks to lack of funding from the state transport department and resistance from bus unions, the only sign of activity on the 10-bigha campus today is that of goats and cows grazing on the green.        
	The huge area and the thick green cover is perfect for goats and cows, said Tapan Pyne, a resident of Patipukur who gets his 20-odd goats to the institute for their daily feast.        
	That is not what the transport department had in mind when it had touted the Transport and Traffic Management Traffic Institute as a vital cog in the wheel to make the streets in and around the city safer for bus passengers and pedestrians.        
	A 1-km zig-zag concrete strip of road was planned to test the drivers. Pictorial signals would be fitted along the stretch, which the drivers would have to identify and obey. Only if they passed the tests would they be allowed to drive a bus.        
	Construction of the bus bays and concrete road strips for buses has stopped since August 2008.        
	The deadline for the opening has been missed so many times that no one remembers when exactly this institute was supposed to start functioning, said a transport department official.        
	According to sources, the transport department has decided to go slow and not release funds because the institute is not deemed priority. So what if over 400 lives are lost every year to rash driving and resoled tyres.        
	There is also resistance from bus union. If all bus drivers are forced to appear for such a test, 95 per cent of them will fail. That is what the unions are opposed to, said a transport official.         
	Unless an extensive training programme is undertaken for drivers, buses on city streets will continue to kill and maim, warned transport consultant S.M. Ghosh.        
	When Metro visited the Jessore Road institute on Monday afternoon  within 48 hours of the Bankim Setu tragedy in which a racing minibus had claimed 12 lives  not a single transport department official was to be seen. The only men on duty were two locals entrusted with the task of gatekeeping.        
	We lock and unlock the main gates when any babu from the transport department comes or when a stray lorry carrying construction materials arrives, said Shyamal Das and Susovan Ghosh, both residents of Patipukur.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Books and documents in public libraries across the country will soon be just a click away.        
	The Raja Rammohan Roy Library Foundation, set up by the human resource development ministry in 1972, plans to link all public libraries in the country to its website, which will also list documents housed at each library.        
	A researcher looking for a document or a book can access the foundations website by clicking on a link on each librarys site. A search tool on our website will show which library has the book or the document, said K.K. Banerjee, the director of the foundation.        
	The foundation is also working towards creating a prototype digital library, which will list its digitised archives that can be accessed free by anyone from across the country.        
	A number of excellent personal collections have been digitised. We want to make them available to the public, said Banerjee.        
	The digital library will have journals, newspapers and rare documents from pre-Independent India. We expect the library will be ready in a year or two, said Banerjee.

                      Aesthetic photo-stories                    One of the greatest photo-journalists of our time, Marc Riboud was one of the first European photographers to go to China. His telling reportages on North Vietnam won him worldwide acclaim. Later, he travelled all over the world, but mostly in Asia, Africa, the US and Japan. Both showing and transcending reality, his images are more than mere documentary. Capturing fleeting moments of life through powerful compositions, his ability to discover beauty in the mundane, everyday life of the common man marks him out as an artist of extraordinary taste and sensitivity. Riboud has been witness to the atrocities of war and the apparent degradation of a culture repressed from within. But what is significant about his works is that they capture the graces of daily life set in sun-drenched facets of the globe or the lyricism of a childs play in an urban metropolis. Hosted by The Seagull Foundation for the Arts and Tasveer, Marc Riboud - Photographer, the ongoing exhibition, features a selection that bears testimony to the diverse travels and experiences of the veteran artist.                    Event: An exhibition of photographs by Marc Riboud When: Till March 10; 2 pm - 8 pm Where: Seagull Arts amp; Media Resource Centre, 36C S.P. Mukherjee Road

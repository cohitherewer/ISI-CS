The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | SC turns down deadline plea
                                                                                                               SC turns down deadline plea
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Transport operators failed to get a reprieve in the Supreme Court on Tuesday but that did not deter them from bringing out several banned vehicles as most cops were busy with Subhas Chakrabortys funeral procession.         
	The apex court refused to extend the July 31 deadline set by Calcutta High Court for the phase-out of commercial vehicles 15 years and older.         
	Making an urgent mention before a three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan, transporters lawyer Kalyan Bandopadhyay pleaded for more time to take old vehicles off the road.        
	The order (of the high court) has already been implemented, the three-judge bench observed while turning down Bandopadhyays plea. However, at the request of the operators, the bench advanced the next hearing from August 13 to August 10.         
	Operators chose to put up a brave front despite the denial of an extension of the deadline. Six days (between Tuesday and August 10) wont make much of a difference. We are hopeful of a favourable verdict, said Trinamul leader Swarnakamal Saha, the spokesperson for the Banijyik Paribahan Bachao Committee, an umbrella body of transporters.        
	A large number of banned vehicles were on the roads as there was no crackdown on Tuesday with almost the entire police force deployed on funeral duty. The thrust today was more on crowd management, an officer said.         
	Lalbazar, however, claimed that not one banned vehicle plied in the city. We had all arrangements in place but no vehicle under the banned categories was found plying, said joint police commissioner (headquarters) Jawed Shamim.        
	Asked about Wednesdays crackdown plan, a senior officer said: The force would be deployed on only one shift  8am to 6pm.... You cant expect all our men to be involved in the crackdown. We have other commitments as well.        
	During the day, transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and updated him about the status of enforcement of the high court ban. The chief minister had not bothered himself with the nitty-gritty of the issue. But now that Chakraborty is no more, he has to be in the loop, said an official. Chowdhury later told Metro: The crackdown slackened a bit today but will resume tomorrow.        
	Commuters faced fewer problems on Day 4 of the ban because of lighter rush-hour traffic as most schools were closed to pay respect to the departed transport minister.

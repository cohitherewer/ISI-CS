The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fresh dupe charge on firm
                                                                                                               Fresh dupe charge on firm
          OUR BUREAU                  
	A fresh complaint has been lodged against Infogen Global alleging that it had duped 31 students from an engineering college in Orissa of Rs 50,000 each.        
	The principal of Rourkelas Padmanava College of Engineering, A.L. Kundu, has lodged an FIR against the unlicensed IT firm with Bidhannagar (East) police station. We have started a probe, said an officer.        
	The complaint stated that Infogen, whose owner Anirban Ghosh has been absconding since around 400 employees filed an FIR saying they had not received their salaries since September, had offered campus placement to 50 students of the college in September 2008.         
	Of them, 31 accepted the offer and paid a security deposit of Rs 50,000 each through bank drafts.        
	Thereafter, the FIR alleged, there was no communication from the company or its recruitment partner Orion Educate Private Limited.        
	No one in INFOGEN is taking our calls, which seems to confirm our fear that the company had ulterior motives while offering jobs to our students, said Kundu.        
	The college has also written to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and state IT minister Debesh Das seeking help. We have received a letter from the college and are looking into the matter, Das said on Wednesday.        
	The INFOGEN employees who filed the first FIR said the owner and other directors of the company had not been coming to office since they defaulted on paying the salaries. The company had issued a few cheques to the employees in November, which had bounced.        
	Around 400 employees then learnt that INFOGEN had made them guarantors to a loan of Rs 25 lakh it had taken from the Amtala branch of Union Bank of India.        
	On Wednesday, IT minister Das met the members of West Bengal Information Technology Services Association at Webel Bhavan, in Salt Lake, to discuss the progress of the probe against INFOGEN.        
	We are not satisfied with the probe and have asked for a CID inquiry, said Malay Pal Chowdhury, a spokesperson for the association.        
	An officer investigating the case said the balance in the companys Amtala account had gone from Rs 1 crore last July to Rs 1,200 now.        
	The cops had also raided Ghoshs house in Sarisha, Diamond Harbour, but found no one there. Residents, however, said Ghoshs mother Jaya, one of the directors of the company, had escaped through a back door during the raid.

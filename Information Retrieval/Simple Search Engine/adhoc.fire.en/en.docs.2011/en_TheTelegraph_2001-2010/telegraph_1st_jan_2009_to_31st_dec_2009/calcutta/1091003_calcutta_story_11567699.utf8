                              Kids at Don Bosco Nitika on Thursday. (Anindya Shankar Ray)                                  
	The kids started trooping in long before the party at Don Bosco Nitika in Entally was to begin on Thursday. They gathered obediently, only their shinning eyes giving away their excitement. But when they spotted the multicoloured inflated bouncy castle with a huge Mickey Mouse on top, they rushed forward in glee.         
	I love bouncing and I can do it for 10 minutes straight! I also love going to melas! giggled 12-year-old Bikash Kumar Yadav from Dhanbad, who stays at Don Bosco Ashalayam, an NGO that works with street children.         
	The event was organised by The Park along with Childline India Foundation as part of the Joy of Giving Week, celebrated from September 27 to October 3. The attractions on Thursday included a magic show, a tattoo artist, a huge inflated Winnie the Pooh, a clown and a Mickey Mouse walking around, shaking hands, followed by refreshments for 100-odd kids belonging to the foundations partners.         
	The Joy of Giving Week initiative has found champions from various spheres of life, including Sachin Tendulkar, A.R. Rahman, Rahul Dravid, Nandita Das, Madhavan, Imtiaz Ali and Azim Premji. The week, which includes Gandhi Jayanti, has brought about a surge of diverse activities across the country, including ahimsa rallies, movie screenings and star-studded events.         
	The Joy of Giving Week is a new national movement that aims to engage every Indian citizen in giving back to society in a way that he or she chooses. The Week is an open platform for people to give what they choose  money, time, skills or resources, said Venkat Krishnan N., the director of GiveIndia, the nodal organisation for this initiative.        
	On Thursday, another bunch of 800 children gathered at the Boral Multi Project Centre, near Garia. The Economic Rural Development Society had organised a health camp where soap and toothpaste were distributed to the kids, in association with Hindustan Unilever Limited. Along with New Allied Diagnostic Centre, the society also organised a check-up for the elderly.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bullets, barriers for Buddha 
                                                                                                               Bullets, barriers for Buddha 
          A STAFF REPORTER                           Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee                                  
	Anyone breaching the chief ministers security cordon will be shot down if necessary, said policemen responsible for protecting VIPs, a day after a college student on a bike veered too close to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees convoy.         
	Aggressive violation of the security ring around the chief ministers convoy will prompt strong retaliatory action. We will shoot down the intruder if necessary. There should be no compromise with VIP security, said A.K. Maliwal, the director of security.        
	The police also proposed portable barriers on routes taken by VIPs to restrict traffic during convoy movement.         
	Its difficult to post officers at every crossing or position police vehicles across the carriageway to control traffic. Portable barriers may be placed so that the traffic is forced to slow down, said a senior officer of the traffic police.         
	On Thursday morning, the student barged into the chief ministers cavalcade at the Park Street-Camac Street crossing before speeding away. The last car in the convoy had to stop to avoid hitting the bike.         
	Investigations revealed that a traffic officer had tried to stop the youth on Camac Street but he sped off towards Park Street. A resident of central Calcutta, the youth was later arrested from the intersection of Park Street and Free School Street and released on bail after he pleaded ignorance of the rules.        
	Senior officers at Lalbazar sought a detailed report into the incident from the Special Branch.        
	Fridays security audit revealed how the Special Security Unit, responsible for covering VVIPs, were woefully short of infrastructure, including drivers trained in handling special cars, bullet proof cars and cellphone jammers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Need for speed keeps trio in the fast lane
                                                                                                               Need for speed keeps trio in the fast lane

	At 23, Amittrajit Ghosh is to racing enthusiasts in Calcutta what Narain Karthikeyan is to every race car driver in the country  a trailblazer.        
	Amittrajit, a former national racing champion who very few know about in the city, has inspired a bunch of city-based youngsters with a need for speed to pursue professional motorsport.         
	One of his juniors in the circuit, 18-year-old Chirag Malhotra, has already made it to the go-karting squad of the Bangalore-based Team Red Rooster Racing and is competing with the best at the JK Tyre Rotax Max National Championship 2009.         
	Another protg, Sourabh Chowdhury, is making a mark in the national rallying scene.         
	Amittrajit is the one who got me interested in rallying. I had navigated both for him and his father before making my debut as a driver. I finished runner-up in the 1,400cc category of the Indian National Rally Championship last year, Sourabh, 19, told Metro.        
	For Amittrajit, inspiration came from within the family. His parents Arindam and Poli Ghosh are rally veterans who continue to pursue the sport as a hobby. Elder sister Somonnita is an accomplished navigator.         
	Amittrajit won the national championship in the Formula Maruti category in 2005 and became the national rally champion two years later.         
	I had taken a break from racing in 2006 just to get into rallying. After winning the National Rally Championship in 2007 (1400cc category), I joined Team Red Rooster Racing and now drive a Cedia 2000cc N+ in the prime category. I am leading the field this year, said the 23-year-old, who also runs a company that manages motorsport events and sells performance accessories.        
	While Amittrajit has tasted success in both racing and rallying, teenager Chirag is taking his first tentative steps in professional go-karting.         
	My goal is to do well in karting and then graduate to cars, said Chirag, who participated in the Asian Zone Karting Championship last year.        
	So what drives these youngsters to live life in the fast lane despite the risks and the paltry rewards?        
	Speed is an addiction. I was 12 when I saw a cousin race in a go-karting competition at Clown Town in Patuli and was fascinated by the idea of speed. I got into a go-kart just to check out what it was like, and racing is all I have wanted to do since, said Chirag, slipping out of his white racing suit with the flourish of a professional.        
	Chirags addiction to speed has spilled over to all aspects of his life. I even study fast. I am impatient about everything, the teenager from Cambridge School chuckled.        
	All three lads own modified cars that produce more torque than the normal versions. Chirag drives a remodelled Honda City, Saurabh is at the wheel of a Mitsubishi Cedia and Amittrajit dotes on his Mitsubishi Lancer EVO. But burning rubber burns the pocket, too, and getting sponsors is a problem for anyone who intends to make racing and rallying a career.         
	I have visited many company offices in Calcutta for sponsorship but none has offered help. We have managed to survive in this sport only because our parents have been very supportive. Racing is still not popular in the city because it is an expensive sport to pursue, said Amittrajit, whose goal is to compete in the world rally championships.        
	Difficulties notwithstanding, none of the boys is ready to give up motorsport for anything.         
	For us, this is not a weekend hobby. We are in it because nothing gives us more pleasure than racing and rallying, said Saurabh.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Exam dates hit hard
                                                                                                               Exam dates hit hard
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	The sudden bandh call left colleges and universities in a tizzy on Thursday with a number of undergraduate and postgraduate degree examinations being rescheduled.        
	More than two lakh examinees will be hit as Calcutta, Jadavpur, Burdwan and Kalyani universities have been forced to revise Fridays schedule.        
	Nearly 70,000 students were supposed to write the BA, BSc Part-II examinations under the 1+1+1 system on Friday. This apart, several thousand students were supposed to appear for the BA, BSc Part-I under the old 2+1 system, and the BBA, and MA and MSc exams in 25 subjects. All examinations have been postponed, said Debashis Biswas, the deputy controller of examinations at Calcutta University (CU).        
	The BBA and BA, BSc Part I and II examinations will now be held on August 8. The revised dates for the postgraduate exams in 25 subjects will be declared later, he added.        
	CU officials fear that the bandh will have a ripple effect on the entire examination schedule, including declaration of results.        
	Jadavpur University was less badly hit with only the MA history exam slated for Friday.        
	Burdwan and Kalyani universities have pushed back a number of BA, BSc, MA and MSc examinations.        
	Thousands of students who have cleared the joint entrance examinations this year will be also affected by the bandh as authorities of the West Bengal Joint Entrance Examination Board have decided to postpone Fridays counselling session for allotment of engineering seats.        
	The ongoing counselling was supposed to continue till July 22. In view of the bandh, the students who were supposed to attend the counselling on July 17 will be required to come on July 18. So, the counselling will continue till July 23, said Sidhartha Dutta, the board chairman.         
	Students and guardians coming from other states will be the hardest hit, but there is no way out, added Dutta.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Assault by hooch seller 
                                                                                                               Assault by hooch seller 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A hooch-seller and his customers allegedly thrashed a 36-year-old homemaker after she asked them to move out of her fathers home in Shibpur, Howrah, on Friday morning.        
	Nayantara Pramanik, who has a six-year-old daughter, was taken to South Howrah State General Hospital and later shifted to SSKM Hospital. Her condition was critical. Bablu Ghati, the hooch-seller, has been arrested.         
	Nayantaras father Basudeb said Bablu had rented a room from him two months back and started selling hooch. I complained to police but to no avail. When Nayantara, who was visiting me, asked Bablu to vacate the room, he and his customers abused her and then pounced on her with sticks and rods.         
	An officer of Shibpur police station blamed landlord-tenant fight for the attack.

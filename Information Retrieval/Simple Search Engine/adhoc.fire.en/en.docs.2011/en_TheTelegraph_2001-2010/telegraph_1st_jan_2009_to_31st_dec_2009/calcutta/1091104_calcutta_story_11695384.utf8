The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bus operators dare govt to seize permit
                                                                            Wednesday , November 4 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Bus operators dare govt to seize permit

	Transport operators who missed the October 31 deadline for filing applications for replacement of phased-out buses are also set to ignore the 15-day grace period because they think the government cant afford to cancel a single permit.        
	I am sure there will be many more extensions (of the deadline). The number of private buses on the road needs to increase substantially for the government to even contemplate going hard at those who dont comply, said Swarnakamal Saha, the leader of the Trinamul Congress-backed transport lobby.        
	On Wednesday, when Metro asked transport minister Ranjit Kundu what action he would initiate against those who had ignored the deadline without valid reasons, he said: Wait and watch. What action we would take after the 15-day (grace) period is over, I will announce on the 15th day (November 19).        
	According to officials of Kundus department, the government has little choice but to wait, and wait indefinitely if need be.        
	Private buses have dwindled to the extent that cancellation of permits is no longer a feasible option. Inviting applications for new permits is not an alternative either because there have been few takers so far, said a senior official who didnt wish to be named.        
	When Kundu announced the deadline on October 7, the operators of only 465 of the 3,067 banned vehicles (2,557 buses, 510 minibuses) had applied for replacement. The number has only gone up by about 800 since.        
	I dont have the exact figures but I am aware that a significant number of operators did not comply with the deadline, Kundu told Metro.        
	The significant number is nearly 60 per cent of the banned vehicles.        
	Transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury had announced last week that those who would fail to apply for replacement within the deadline would be showcaused and granted 15 days to explain the delay.        
	The government will consider the cases of those who are facing genuine problems, he said.         
	That the applications were being accepted on Tuesday without the applicants being slapped with showcause notices also bore out the wait and watch strategy.        
	Since October 31 was a Saturday and Monday, too, was a holiday, we accepted applications for replacement on Tuesday. The defaulters would be showcaused from Wednesday, said the transport minister.

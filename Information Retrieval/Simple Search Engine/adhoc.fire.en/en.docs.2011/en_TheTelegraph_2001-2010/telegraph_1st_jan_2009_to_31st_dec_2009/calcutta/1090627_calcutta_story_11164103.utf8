	Airports across the country are incurring losses because of downturn-induced underutilisation of their infrastructure, the civil aviation secretary said on Friday.        
	A study would be conducted by the civil aviation ministry on how to ensure optimum utilisation of the facilities, M. Madhavan Nambiar said at an interactive session at Merchants Chamber of Commerce on Friday.        
	There is not as much traffic in the airports as was projected. The revenue is going down with the traffic, he added.        
	According to the civil aviation secretary, only a small part of the perishable cargo terminal and cold storage was being used at the city airport.        
	The aviation industry in India has run up a cumulative loss of Rs 15,000 crore till March 31 because of the downturn, said Nambiar.        
	He met state chief secretary Ashok Mohan Chakrabarti at Writers Buildings and requested him to take steps so that the Cooch Behar airport could be utilised. The airport was upgraded by spending Rs 15 crore.

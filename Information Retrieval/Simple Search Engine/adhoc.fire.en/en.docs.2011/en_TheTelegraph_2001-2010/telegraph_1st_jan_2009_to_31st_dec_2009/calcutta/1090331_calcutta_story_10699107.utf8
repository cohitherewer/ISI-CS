          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The city will soon have a school which promises to groom students through modern techniques of teaching as well as meditation and yoga.        
	Sri Sri Academy, being set up by Sri Sri Ravi Shankar Vidya Mandir, the educational wing of the Art of Living Foundation, will start functioning from February 2010.        
	We will start with classes from Nursery to V and then upgrade the school to the Plus-II level. The school is likely to be fully operational in three years, said Manish Poddar, a member of the governing body of the SSRVM trust.        
	The school, which will seek affiliation to the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examination, will come up on a 1.5-acre plot in Alipore.         
	The six-storey building, surrounded by playgrounds, will accommodate more than 2,400 students.        
	Poddar said the trust ran 79 schools across the country. This will be our first school in West Bengal. We want to set up an institution in every district of the country with the aim to broaden the vision and deepen the roots.        
	The school, Poddar added, will impart education based on the principles of humanity and spirituality, resulting in holistic growth of all students. As part of its aim to impart stress-free education, the school will have yoga and meditation centres and also provide opportunities for adventure sports, outdoor activities and creative arts.        
	According to Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, meditation and yoga help the mind become more developed. The school will abide by the principle, said Poddar.        
	The school will also house a state-of-the-art audio-visual room, hi-tech laboratories and a well-stocked library.

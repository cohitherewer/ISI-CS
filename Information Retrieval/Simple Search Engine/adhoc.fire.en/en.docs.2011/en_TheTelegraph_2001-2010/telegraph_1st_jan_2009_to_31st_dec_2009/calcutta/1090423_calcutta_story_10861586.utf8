                                                                                                               Kin not liable to repay loan 
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court ruled on Wednesday that financial institutions had no right to lodge cases against the kin of a borrower who died before repaying a loan. The court also held that a complaint cannot be lodged against a dead person.         
	The observation were made by a division bench while hearing the anticipatory bail prayer of Dipak Mukherjee, an employee of UCO Bank in Howrah, who was apprehending arrest as his wife had not been able to repay a bank loan before her death in March 2007.         
	The court granted him anticipatory bail.        
	The prosecution lawyer said Soma, the wife of Dipak and an employee of a private firm, had booked a flat at Kaikhali and obtained a loan of Rs 25 lakh from the Howrah branch of Canara Bank in July 2006.         
	Eight months later, Soma died of a heart attack. Three months after her death, Canara Bank lodged a police complaint against the couple. The police started searching for Dipak. Failing to find him, they arrested his driver, Moloy, a week ago. Moloy is in custody.        
	Dipaks lawyer Debabrata Chatterjee said Soma had been duped by the promoters, MS Construction, and did not get possession of the flat. The lawyer asked the court why the police were hounding his client when he did not even get possession of the apartment.         
	After hearing both sides, the court said banks should sanction a loan only after a potential borrower gets life insurance cover so that the loan can be recovered from the insurance amount in case the borrower dies. It said Canara Bank had not followed the norm while granting the loan.

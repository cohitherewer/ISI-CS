The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Another arrest for assault
                                                                                                               Another arrest for assault
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	One more youth was arrested on Monday in connection with the assault on a woman and her friend in her brother-in-laws house in Shibpur on Saturday night.        
	Two others were arrested earlier in connection with the incident. The fourth person named in the FIR is on the run.        
	The accused were allegedly part of a gang of around 20 that barged into the Mahesh Pal Lane house while owner Tapas Kumar Sen, a bank official, was on vacation with his family and assaulted his sister-in-law Mallika Banerjee, who was staying over, and Chandranath Sarkar, who was visiting, after they refused to pay Rs 30,000 for a puja in the area.         
	The men damaged Sens car, broke electronic goods and set furniture on fire.         
	An additional superintendent of police, Sukesh Jain, visited the family on Monday and assured the members of action against the guilty. Armed policemen posted outside the house on Sunday were withdrawn.        
	The two local clubs, Balak Sangha and Abasarer Sathi, which allegedly harbour criminals, were closed on Monday. Policemen conducted several raids in the area on Sunday night in search of the members of the clubs but they have gone missing, said a resident.        
	On May 4, a gang allegedly led by local extortionist Subrata Sanyal alias Gabu raided an adjacent house with pistols and choppers and seriously injured five members of a family for lodging a complaint against them at Chatterjeehat police outpost.        
	Sen, who is a member of a CPM-affiliated bank union, alleged that Trinamul Congress supporters were behind the attack on his sister-in-law and her friend. Bithika Panja, the local Trinamul councillor, denied the allegation. Residents too said the assault was not the fallout of political rivalry.

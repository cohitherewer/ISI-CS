                      Visions from the inner eye                    Tactile senses, audio clues, memories of sight, the warmth of light, cognitive skills and last but not least, intuitive abilities  these are the fundamental tools used by the photographers of Beyond Sight, the ongoing exhibition of photographs by those with varying degrees of visual impairment. Suffering from partial to total blindness, these photographers have used the camera as an extension of the self, to explore the visual world and gain deeper insight while recording their imagination and point-of-view. Illuminating a new line of thought, distinct from the way we approach photography, it makes us go back to the basic concept of the subject, that of creating a picture. More importantly, the show celebrates the human spirit of self-expression, which defies all odds. Besides, it helps to sensitise the public, facilitate social inclusion and raise funds for the cause of the visually impaired. Along with regular photographs, the exhibition also has on display touchable raised images, Braille footnotes, large prints, visual aids and audio description for visually impaired visitors. The culmination of the Blind With Camera project, initiated by Partho Bhowmick in association with the Victoria Memorial School for the Blind in Mumbai, the exhibition also aims to integrate the visually impaired into mainstream society through the medium of photography.

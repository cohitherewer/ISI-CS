	The report A tale of two cities, March 22, was interesting. I visited Dhaka for the first time earlier this year.             
	The city has a lot of similarities with Calcutta, although it can improve on many counts. The traffic system is chaotic with rundown buses, battered Toyota taxis and cyclerickshaws. But air pollution is much less there since the vehicles run on CNG. The main roads are also cleaner than ours.

	The PWD should have been more careful about the lettering on the Trigonometrical Survey tower (Caleidoscope, March 22).             
	The Great Trigonometrical Survey with base line measurement started on 10th April, 1802.           
	A number of towers were constructed to accomplish triangulation survey throughout the country. The observations were taken at night by installing a light atop the other towering-stations.           
	The work took six decades. The PWD should immediately rectify the errors on the said GTS tower near Paikpara Rajbati.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fire in trade hub market
                                                                                                               Fire in trade hub market
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A fire broke out in a meter box in a four-storeyed commercial building in Sonapatti, Burrabazar, on Sunday afternoon. Four tenders took 30 minutes to douse the flames.        
	There was not much damage since the 200 shops in the market were closed.         
	Residents of the area saw smoke coming out of the meter box on the ground floor of the building around 5pm.        
	We immediately informed some shop-owners in the building. They alerted the police and the fire brigade and rushed to the spot, said Bishnu Das, who owns a shop in Sonapatti. The fire department gave a clean chit to the building administrators. We found that the market had adequate fire fighting arrangements. Forensic tests will reveal the cause of the fire, said Biplab Sengupta, an official of the fire department.         
	Traders felt it was an isolated incident and were confident of avoiding a big fire.        
	There has not been a fire at Sonapatti in the recent past. The market was closed so extra electrical load could not have caused the fire. Such an incident could have happened anywhere, said Arun Bhuvalka, the vice-president of Chamber of Textile Trade amp; Industry.         
	The incident, however, has brought to focus the fire-prone nature of Burrabazar and its adjoining areas. According to the West Bengal Fire amp; Emergency Department, close to 100 fires have broken out in the area since January 2007, including the 100 hour blaze at Nandaram market last year.

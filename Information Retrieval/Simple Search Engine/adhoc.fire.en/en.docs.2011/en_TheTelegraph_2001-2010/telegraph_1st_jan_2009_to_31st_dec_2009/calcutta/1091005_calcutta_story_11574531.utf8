                                                                                                               Shooters at large
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Police are still clueless about the identity of the four youths who shot Abir Neogi in Baguiati and snatched his bike on Friday. The 28-year-old is recovering at hospital.        
	We spoke to Abir and got a description of the youths who attacked him, said Rahul Srivastava, the superintendent of North 24-Parganas police. Sleuths have prepared sketches of the suspects. We have activated our sources to trace the youths but it seems they have fled to another district, said an officer.        
	Abir, an executive of a private insurance company, was attacked at Jora Mandir while he was returning home to Jadavpur.

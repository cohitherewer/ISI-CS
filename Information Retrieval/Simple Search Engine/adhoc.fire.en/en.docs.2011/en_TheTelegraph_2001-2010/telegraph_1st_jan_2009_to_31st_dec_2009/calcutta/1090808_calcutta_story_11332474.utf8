	More than a dozen students and staff members were injured in a clash between supporters of the Trinamul Congress Chhatra Parishad and the Students Federation of India at Dinabandhu Andrews College in Garia, on Friday morning.         
	The supporters grappled with each other and broke windowpanes and furniture on the ground floor while university exams were being held on the second and third floors.         
	Some students had to be admitted to hospital. Two Trinamul Chhatra Parishad supporters were arrested for damaging college property. A contingent from Jadavpur police station was posted at the college.         
	According to students, the clash broke out after SFI resisted a Trinamul Chhatra Parishad bid to open a unit in the college. The college union is controlled by the SFI.         
	Principal Somnath Mukherjee said outsiders had beaten up students and damaged college property.         
	Trouble started after Pranabesh Mondal, the president of the district committee of the Trinamul Chhatra Parishad, met Mukherjee to seek permission to open a unit of the organisation in the college.         
	While I was speaking to Mondal in my room, I heard commotion outside. I stepped out to find students, teachers and other employees running for shelter. Outsiders were throwing bricks and beating them with bamboo sticks. I had no option but to call the police, said Mukherjee.         
	About 300 students from various colleges were writing their Part I examinations on the upper floors then.        
	The clash continued till noon. SFI supporters did not allow Mondal and another Trinamul Chhatra Parishad member to leave the campus. They were escorted out by the police.        
	Sourav Saha, an SFI supporter, said: We were sitting in the union room when Trinamul Chhatra Parishad supporters started hitting us.         
	Tamal Sen, a Trinamul Chhatra Parishad supporter, said SFI supporters attacked them without provocation.

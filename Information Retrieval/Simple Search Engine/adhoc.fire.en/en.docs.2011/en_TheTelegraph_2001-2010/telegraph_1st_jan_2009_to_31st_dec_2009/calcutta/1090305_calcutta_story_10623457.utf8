The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | MLAs blame rules for poor fund spend
                                                                                                               MLAs blame rules for poor fund spend
          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	Assembly members have blamed the rules governing the local area development fund for their poor record in utilising the money.        
	Cutting across party lines, the MLAs are demanding more freedom in spending money under the Bidhayak Elaka Unnayan Programme (BEUP).        
	An MLA gets Rs 50 lakh every financial year from the state planning and development department to spend on their constituencies.        
	But a recent report by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), as reported in Metro on Wednesday, has revealed that chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and cabinet colleague Manab Mukherjee are among the bottom 10 in spending the money allocated since 2005-06.        
	Mukherjee  the report states  hasnt spent a rupee from his allocation till February 25. Of the 26 MLAs from Calcutta, only nine have utilised the full amount. Eleven MLAs spent between 50 and 99.58 per cent and the remaining six utilised half the amount allotted.        
	The rules are unnecessarily stringent, coming in the way of spending money, said Tarak Bandopadhyay, a Trinamul MLA and the head of the House standing committee on the BEUP.        
	The committee members, he added, have unanimously agreed to make the BEUP rules more flexible and drawn up a list of suggestions which has been forwarded to the government.        
	The relaxations the MLAs have been demanding are related to allocation of funds for buying ambulances and hearses for NGOs, and TV sets and gym equipment for clubs.        
	For buying an ambulance or a hearse, the rules state that the ownership should rest with the CMC. Thats absurd, said Partha Chatterjee, the leader of the Opposition.        
	Some MLAs said they could not allot funds for development of schools, libraries and registered clubs. But last year, the government had announced that schools and clubs that have a land title in their favour were eligible for the money.        
	A professor of economics at IIM Calcutta, however, said the MLAs were only trying to cover up their inefficiency by blaming the rules.        
	If the rules were really so stringent, nine MLAs could not have spent the entire allocation. The real problem is that the MLAs are not in touch with their constituencies, said the teacher.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A businessman helped police arrest two youths from Bihar who allegedly tried to flee after carjacking a Bolero from Ballygunge late on Sunday.        
	Sanjoy Pathak, who witnessed the carjacking on Ashutosh Chowdhury Avenue around 11.35pm, dialled 100 (emergency helpline of the police) and kept shadowing the Bolero.        
	A team from the Radio Flying Squad intercepted the car at the Lords Bakery crossing. Seeing the cops, two of the gang members  Bikash Roy and Nasim Akhter  jumped out and started running. The policemen soon caught up with them. Sanjay Roy, who was behind the wheels, sped off. We are trying to track down the vehicle and the third culprit, said Jawed Shamim, deputy commissioner (detective department).

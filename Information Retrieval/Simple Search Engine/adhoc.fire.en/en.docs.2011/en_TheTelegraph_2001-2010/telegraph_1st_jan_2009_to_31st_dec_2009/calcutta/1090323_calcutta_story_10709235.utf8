The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Buddha convoy in mishap
                                                                                                               Buddha convoy in mishap
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	A pilot car escorting the chief minister was hit by a police vehicle in the convoy on Diamond Harbour Road on Sunday evening, leaving two cops injured.        
	The driver of the chief ministers car, fourth in the convoy, slammed the brakes on time.        
	As the convoy came to a halt in Thakurpukur, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee got off his car and walked up to the pilot car to enquire about the injured cops. He instructed the officers to make immediate arrangements for their treatment.        
	The two policemen, who suffered head and leg injuries, were taken to Vidyasagar Hospital, said an officer.        
	The mishap occurred around 6.30pm while the chief minister was on his way back to the city from Diamond Harbour, where he campaigned for Shamik Lahiri, the CPMs candidate from the constituency for the Lok Sabha elections.        
	The convoy was plying down Diamond Harbour Road, with the driver of the pilot car constantly sounding the hooter. When the convoy reached Thakurpukur, a state transport corporation bus came in the way, said an officer.        
	The bus driver veered towards the left and suddenly stopped. The driver of the pilot car realised that his vehicle was going to ram into the bus. He immediately pressed the brakes and stopped, the officer added.        
	But the driver of the second vehicle in the convoy failed to control speed on time and hit the pilot car. Two constables sitting at the rear of the pilot car suffered head and leg injuries, the officer said.        
	The tail car, brought in the front of the convoy, escorted the chief minister to Nandan.        
	Last Wednesday, a youth riding a motorcycle hit the tail car of the chief ministers convoy at the crossing of Park Street and Camac Street.

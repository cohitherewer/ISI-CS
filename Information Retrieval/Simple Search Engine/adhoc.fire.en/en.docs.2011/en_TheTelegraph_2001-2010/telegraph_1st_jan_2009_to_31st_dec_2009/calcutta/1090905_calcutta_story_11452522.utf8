The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Seats vacant in tech colleges
                                                                                                               Seats vacant in tech colleges
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	As many as 2,629 seats in various private engineering are likely to remain vacant this year.        
	The fourth round of counselling for 3,081 vacant seats in private engineering colleges saw 452 students take admission.        
	The vacant seats are mostly in computer science, information technology and related subjects, which have been robbed of their job prospects by the global downturn. In several colleges, not a single seat in these subjects have been filled up.        
	The fourth round  which ended on Thursday  was called following a plea by the private colleges that had failed to fill up their first-year seats in the earlier rounds. In response to another request from the colleges, the government had extended the cut-off rank on the state JEE merit list from 60,000 to 80,000.        
	The last student who took admission in the fourth phase ranked 79,976. Students with ranks between 1 and 60,000 were called in the first three rounds.        
	Asked whether another round of counselling would be held to fill up the remaining seats, JEE board chairman Siddhartha Dutta said: Chances are thin because classes have started in full swing in most colleges.        
	Most board members are opposed to a fifth round on the ground that it would lead to a decline in the standard of engineering education.        
	A student who has ranked beyond 80,000 should not be encouraged to pursue a course in engineering, said an official in the higher education department.        
	Dutta, however, said the government would take a call on whether another round would be held. We have submitted a report to the higher education department stating the seat position.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Burglars have a field night
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Burglars have a field night
          A STAFF REPORTER                                          
	A south Calcutta house belonging to a businesswoman and her engineer husband was robbed of cash and valuables amounting to Rs 2.5 lakh while the couple were in another part of the city caring for an ailing family member.         
	Sarmistha Saha, the co-owner of a prominent Gariahat sari shop, and husband Chandan, who deals in real estate, were at her ailing brother-in-law Kajols bedside in Beleghata when news of the break-in at their Bhowanipore home arrived around 5.30am on Sunday.         
	The couple went to their ground-floor house to find a window grille with the middle bars twisted to create an opening, three doors with safety locks gouged out, and five ransacked wardrobes and safes.        
	The thieves took away Rs 54,000 in cash, a platinum ring, three of my watches and nine belonging to my wife, and a digital camera that we had purchased only five days ago. Some other items may have been stolen, though we havent yet checked what else is missing, said 52-year-old Chandan, who had locked the Padmapukur Road house and left for Beleghata along with his wife on Friday after hearing that his brother had suffered a stroke.        
	According to him, a team from Bhowanipore police station had passed it off as a petty robbery but cops from the burglary section later said that the theft was the handiwork of professionals.        
	After cutting a part of a window grille to enter the house, the gang sawed out the locks on all three doors. They then went about ransacking the wardrobes and cupboards looking for cash and valuables.        
	The thieves apparently knew that the owners wouldnt be back soon, and took their time in executing their plan. We suspect the operation was carried out through the night, an investigator said.        
	Padmapukur Road is a congested locality with barely five feet separating one building from another. Sarmisthas sister Kaberi Mukherjee and her family occupy the first floor of the building.         
	It is surprising that the thieves managed to clean out the house without anybody coming to know about it. We arent ruling out the involvement of someone known to the family, a police officer said.        
	Kaberi, who co-owns the Gariahat sari shop with her sister, was the first person to notice the broken window grille. She called her sister and brother-in-law, who immediately went to Bhowanipore police station to file an FIR. The cops advised the couple to first visit their house and make a preliminary estimate of the missing cash and items before filing a complaint.        
	 Chandan said burglaries were common in the area. The way this burglary was executed suggests that no home is safe, he added.        
	The Sahas seldom leave their house locked except when they dont have a choice. My wife goes out for work only after I come back, Chandan said.        
	The couples only son Soumyadipto studies in the UK.

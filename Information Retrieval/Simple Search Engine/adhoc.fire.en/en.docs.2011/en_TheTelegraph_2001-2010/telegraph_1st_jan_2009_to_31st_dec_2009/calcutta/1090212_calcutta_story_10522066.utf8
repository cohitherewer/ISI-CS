          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The middle-aged supervisor of an interior design firm died after falling from the 13th floor of a multi-storeyed building on Gurusaday Road on Wednesday morning.        
	Sushil Saha Roy, a 45-year-old Bansdroni resident, was overseeing the interior decoration of a flat in a 14-storeyed building at 23 Gurusaday Road when the mishap occurred around 11am, said an officer of Ballygunge police station.        
	Saha Roy lost his balance while standing near a window and fell. He hit a sun shade on the second floor before dropping to the ground, added the officer.        
	Security guards alerted the residents of the building, who called the police.        
	Saha Roys head and face were smashed and he was lying unconscious. We took him to SSKM Hospital, where he was admitted to Curzon ward. He succumbed to his injuries in the evening, said the officer.        
	A preliminary investigation revealed that 10 labourers were working in the flat when the supervisor fell.        
	Our officers questioned the labourers who were inside the flat when Saha Roy fell to the ground. So far we have not received any complaint, said an investigator.

                                                                                                               Road chase nets robbers
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Three criminals running down MG Road after snatching nearly Rs 50,000 were caught by a traffic sergeant on Wednesday afternoon.        
	Sajal Dutta, a member of the Howrah bridge traffic guard posted at the MG Road-Strand Road crossing, spotted pedestrians chasing three youths around 5.30pm.        
	As one of the youths neared the crossing, I grabbed him by the collar. His two accomplices tried to release him but I overpowered the three and took them to a nearby traffic booth, said Dutta.        
	A bundle of Rs 500 notes was found in the pocket of one of the youths. He had snatched a bag containing Rs 49,500 from a trader minutes earlier, added Dutta.        
	The three were taken to Burrabazar police station in a police jeep. A preliminary investigation revealed that all three had been involved in snatching cases and robberies in central Calcutta.        
	The trio are residents of Canning in South 24-Parganas. During interrogation, they told us that they had snatched a bag containing money from a middle-aged man in a bus, said an officer.         
	Till late on Wednesday, no one contacted the police to claim the money.        
	We have alerted the Lalbazar control room. We will hand over the money only after verifying the claimants identity, added the officer.

	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee asked students of St Xaviers to show the way by staying away from the path of mindless consumerism, after lighting a lamp to inaugurate the 150th-year celebrations of the institution at the Park Street address on Wednesday.         
	Nine thousand members of the extended Xaverian family, including school and college students, their parents, teachers, ex-teachers and members of the school and college alumni, Alsoc and SXCAA, respectively, broke into a lusty cheer  straight out of the school anthem  as Bhattacharjee announced: I hereby declare the 150-year celebrations of St Xaviers, Calcutta open.        
	A stage was erected on the field and a large area was covered to accommodate chairs for the audience.         
	The chief minister began his address quoting the opening lines from Charles Dickenss A Tale of Two Cities: It was the best of times. It was the worst of times         
	We are passing through a difficult time. Progress in science, technology and innovations in economic strategies have advanced our knowledge and helped improve quality of life in modern society. But this development is not uniform throughout the world. The challenge is to close the huge gap between the developed and developing countries and the rich and the poor, Bhattacharjee said.        
	St Xaviers school and college have played an important role in the promotion of quality of education in our state. Many students have risen to colossal heights in their chosen fields. This has been possible because of the dedication of the teachers. We are proud of you and hope the institution will never look back, he concluded.        
	Assembly Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim, an ex-student, was applauded when he revealed that as the institution was celebrating its 150 years, he was celebrating 50 years of graduating from it.                   Students sing at the celebrations on Wednesday.   Picture by Pabitra Das      
	A lot of things have changed compared to when I used to study here. We did not have the privilege of girls studying with us. We used to meet Loreto girls outside. But things change and change for the better and now the boys studying here can meet girls inside the premises, he said with a twinkle in his eyes.        
	Earlier, the evenings celebrations began with a rendition of a Sanskrit sloka and a fusion remix of Tagores Simar majhe asim tumi, which embodies the institutions theme of Nihil Ultra, which translates into Nothing beyond.        
	On the dais were mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, Fr. George Pattery Provential, Rector Fr. George Ponodath, school headmaster Fr. Jerome Francis and college principal Fr. P.C. Mathew. Biman Bose and the US consul-general Beth A. Payne sat in the audience. The addresses were interspersed with music and dance performances by school and college students.

	St Xaviers was born of fire and that fire has been kindled in the hearts of all its students and this has helped them excel in every sphere of life.        
	 Rector Fr. George Ponodath              
	Going down memory lane, my heart and mind cannot comprehend what sacrifices went into the institution. I would like to pay a tribute to all who have been associated with it.         
	 College principal Fr. P.C. Mathew              
	Our boys have gone places, they have carved out a niche for themselves on the biggest stages, competing with the best in the world.         
	 Fr. Jerome Francis, school headmaster              
	For the 125th year celebrations, I came with my father Vinod, a Xaverian. Today, I have come with my son Rishab, who is in Class IX.        
	 Anish Himani, the middle rung in three generations of Xaverians               
	I feel privileged to be an integral part of a milestone of an institution that was instrumental in making me what I am. It was the Fathers and teachers of this institution who encouraged me to pursue music. I am proud to be a Xaverian.

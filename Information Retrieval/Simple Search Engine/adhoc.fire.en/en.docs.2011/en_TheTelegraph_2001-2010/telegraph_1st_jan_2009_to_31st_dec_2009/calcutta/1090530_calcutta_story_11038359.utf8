The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Power after 90 hours
                                                                                                               Power after 90 hours
          OUR BUREAU                          An uprooted tree and lamp post near Science City. (Amit Datta)                                  
	The power situation limped back to normal 96 hours after Cyclone Aila roared past the city. CESC officials claimed normal supply to the entire city resumed by Friday evening.        
	The damage caused by the storm has been fully repaired. A few houses may still be without power because of local faults, said a CESC official.        
	The resumption of supply brought smile to the lips of the people living in Chowbhaga, Tiljala, Netaji Nagar and South Garia, and parts of Jodhpur Park and Behala, who have suffered power cuts for 80-90 hours.        
	It was a relief to see the fans moving and water tanks being refilled again, said Suman Dhawa, a resident of Regent Park, on the southern fringes of the city.        
	P.R. Roy, a resident of Netaji Nagar, said: It seemed we were living in a remote village lacking basic facilities over the past few days. No one from the administration was around to help us.         
	The Regional Labour Institute, in Lake Town, was without power for 99 hours.         
	We had complained to CESC several times but no one turned up to fix the problem. Supply resumed only after I called the state power secretary this afternoon, said Subrata Chatterjee, the administrative officer of the central government undertaking.        
	Trees: Unlike the power situation, signs of another fallout of the storm  roads blocked by uprooted trees  are still visible in some pockets.        
	Most of the uprooted trees have been removed. We hope to wrap up work by Saturday afternoon, said Debasish Chakraborty, the deputy chief engineer in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.        
	Data compiled by the civic body revealed that 2,025 trees had been uprooted across the city in the Aila effect.        
	The felled trees have yielded 1,000 metric tonnes of logs which the CMC has decided to sell. Till the logs are sold, they will be kept in Tallah Park, Deshbandhu Park, Deshapriya Park, Maddox Square and Ramlila Park.        
	Cop lesson: Police seem to have learnt a lesson from the delay in clearing the mess left behind by the storm and have decided to buy 10 sets of electric saws. A senior officer blamed the unusual delay in clearing the arteries on the lack of electric saws.

                                                                                                               Film school to open after seven weeks
  - Officer to probe charges against students           A STAFF REPORTER                          The SRFTI campus off EM Bypass. A Telegraph picture                                        
	The Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute (SRFTI) is likely to reopen after nearly two months on Monday though the tussle between a section of students and the administration has not been resolved.        
	A notice signed by the director of the film school, Swapan Mullick, and put up on the campus on Wednesday evening states academic activities at the institute would resume on May 25. The disciplinary proceedings against six suspended students would also continue, according to the notice.         
	The six were suspended and served chargesheets for defacing the institutes property, gross misconduct with authorities and trespassing, following a governing council meeting in Mumbai.        
	Five of the students filed a writ petition in the high court last week for a stay on the suspension.        
	The students were part of a group that gheraoed the dean, director, administrative officer and the purchase officer for several hours from March 31 to protest the lack of proper academic schedule, inadequate infrastructure and quality of teachers. The institute was indefinitely shut on April 2.         
	The institute issued chargesheets against the students on May 7 and asked them to respond within 10 day.        
	If they admit to the charges, we will decide on the penal measure. If they dont, an independent inquiry will be conducted. Classes wont resume until the six suspended students move out of the campus, Mullick had said.        
	On Thursday, he said: An officer will be appointed by Monday to probe the charges against the students. The officer will get a month to submit his findings to the chairman of the institute, who will present the report before the governing council.        
	The five suspended students, who are still on campus, are awaiting the hearing of the petition on Tuesday.        
	We decided to file the plea after a meeting with other students of the institute, said one of the students.        
	We have to see how we can make up for the lost classes and projects. The dean and faculty intend sitting together and draw up a schedule for workshops and seminars that were cancelled, said Mullick.        
	All the batches have suffered because of the shutdown. Its true that we need more manpower but the loss of classes is difficult to make up for. We hope to reschedule workshops the moment the institute reopens, said Milind Nagmule, the head of the motion picture photography department.

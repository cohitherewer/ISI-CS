The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Neemrana man on heritage and hotel hunt
                                                                                                               Neemrana man on heritage and hotel hunt
  - French building trail takes him to Chandernagore, luxury hospitality address lures him to Bengal          SOUMITRA DAS                          BENGAL CALLING: The Neemrana Fort in Rajasthan                                        
	The Nano may have driven away from Bengal, but Neemrana Hotels is desperate to find a home in this state.        
	Francis Wacziarg, who had started this chain of heritage hotels along with Aman Nath two decades ago and was in town over the weekend, said on Monday evening: We are desperately trying to do a hotel in Bengal. It is a pity not to be present here. When he met Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi earlier in the evening, he, too, was of the same opinion.        
	In Bengal, he has singled out two properties for prospective heritage hotels  a mansion at Chakdighi in Burdwan belonging to Amabarish Sinha, and a jute mill on the Hooghly on the banks opposite Chandernagore. Nothing concrete has emerged yet.        
	Wacziarg was, however, here on a different mission this time  identifying French heritage in India. He is accompanied by Philippe Toussaint, chairman of a 50-year-old association named Vieilles Maisons Francaise (VMF) or French heritage mansions. Having already visited Pondicherry and Karakiel in Tamil Nadu, they went to Chandernagore on Monday morning. They intend to visit both the La Martiniere schools in Calcutta and later Lucknow, and Mahe in Kerala and Yanam in Andhra Pradesh, and Chandigarh designed by Le Corbusier.        
	On Monday morning Wacziarg and Toussaint visited the Chandernagore Museum and Institute where Joseph Franois Dupleix, the then governor of the French town, lived; Sacred Heart Church and the Strand, where the pavilion, which had crumbled after years of neglect and was rebuilt some time ago is, and the famous bakery near the church, which still has the original oven and where bread in the shape of crocodiles and fish are still made. However, being a Monday, both bakery and institute were closed.        
	Wacziarg said the bakery needed to be revamped; it is a bit of a pokey place and the French cemetery with tombs dating back to 1760 was in very, very bad shape. Told about the lack of a good eatery in Chandernagore, he said: Tourists are not interested in food and drink. They were surprised when they came upon a school where a Bengali teacher taught French to 200 students. There is still a French presence there, he remarked. Little wonder it was once known as Farashdanga.              
	But before all else, there are two fundamental requirements  first, it has to be studied how an Alliance Francaise can be opened in Chandernagore, and secondly, how tourism on the river can be developed.        
	There have to be comfortable boats to take tourists from Calcutta. The boats available now are very slow, said Wacziarg.        
	Worse, there are no hotels in Chandernagore.        
	The French ambassador to India, Jerome Bonnafort, is expected to arrive in Calcutta on March 7, and visit Chandernagore along with Gopalkrishna Gandhi, Barun De, who chairs the West Bengal Heritage Commission, and Andre Beteille, the sociologist who hails from that town.        
	Wacziarg, who became an Indian citizen 19 years ago, was originally from France and speaks fluent Hindi.        
	Also on the itinerary of Wacziarg and Toussaint are Kapurthala palace, which was built by a Frenchman and is now Sainik school, and also Govindgarh palace in Amritsar, which was the residence of Maharaja Ranjit Singh.

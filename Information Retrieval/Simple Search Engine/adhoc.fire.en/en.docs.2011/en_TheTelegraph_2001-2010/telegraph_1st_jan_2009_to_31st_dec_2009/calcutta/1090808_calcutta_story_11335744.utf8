	A six-year-old girl tested positive for swine flu on Friday even as the government decided to set up clinics across the state to screen suspects.        
	A doctor at Infectious Diseases Hospital, Beleghata, got herself admitted with symptoms of swine flu.        
	Pranjali Mondal of Salkia, who was admitted to the Beleghata hospital on Thursday, tested positive for the disease but mother Mitali tested negative.        
	Hospital sources said the child would have to stay in the isolation ward of the hospital for five days.         
	The nasal and throat swabs Tapati Mondal, a doctor at the Beleghata hospital now admitted in the isolation ward, will be tested on Saturday. Sources said Mondol had been to the isolation ward on Thursday to examine Manas Saha, a city-based physician who is suffering from swine flu.         
	The special clinics will start functioning at NRS Medical College and Hospital, RG Kar Medical College and Hospital and the Beleghata hospital from Tuesday.        
	In the rest of the state, the clinics will be housed in Burdwan, Bankura, Midnapore and North Bengal medical colleges, as well as in all district and sub-divisional hospitals.        
	Individuals suspected to be suffering from swine flu will be referred to the clinics where their nasal and throat swabs will be collected. The samples will be tested at National Institute for Cholera and Enteric Diseases, said Samar Ghosh, the additional chief secretary in the state health department.        
	People suffering from mild symptoms of the disease will be advised to be quarantined at home, while those with severe flu will be admitted to the Beleghata hospital or any district medical college.        
	Paediatricians from the BC Roy Memorial Hospital for Children will be present in the clinics to screen children, who are most vulnerable to the swine flu-causing H1N1 virus.        
	The government will also issue directives on tackling swine flu to state and private hospitals and educational institutions.        
	Gunarathna Munasingh Arachchige Hasidha, a 20-year-old Sri Lankan who arrived at Calcutta from Chittagong on Thursday and was admitted to the Beleghata hospital, was released on Friday after testing negative for swine flu. Gunarathna, who had missed his flight to Chennai, complained that the authorities did not help him reach the airport despite pleading that he had no money.

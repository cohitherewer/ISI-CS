                      Sounds of electronic music                    They create densely layered tracks with the intended results being grounded between radical experimentalism and timeless pop appeal. Designed to yield more with repeated listening, their songs are minutely detailed. They are Mouse on Mars, the electronic music trio from Germany. Band members Andi Toma (effects, keyboard), Jan St. Werner (effects, keyboard) and Dodo Nkishi (drums) make music that links them to the club music scene, as do their many remixes and collaborations with musicians associated with dance music. Yet, their association with the formalised and utilitarian world of dance music is ironic, as the bands main focus is to place electronic flies in any aural ointment they choose to muck through. The uniqueness of their drum tracks is in their multiple layers, often composed of as many as 20 different tracks: live drums, programmed, digitally processed and their various mutations and combinations. The fills and breaks of their music are set, arranged and placed individually as opposed to being looped. The results, needless to say, are rich, deep and wonderfully varied. This evening, Goethe-Institut, Max Mueller Bhavan, in association with Little i and Soho, presents a live performance by the group and promises to ring in some exciting, electrifying beats.                  Event: Performance by the German music group, Mouse on Mars When: Today at 8 pm Where: Soho, 11/1 Sarat Bose Road

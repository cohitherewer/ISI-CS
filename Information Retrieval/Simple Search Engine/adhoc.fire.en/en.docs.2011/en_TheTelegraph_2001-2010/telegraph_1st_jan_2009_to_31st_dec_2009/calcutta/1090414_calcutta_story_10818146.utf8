          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Mufti Ibrahim, the alleged Harkat-ul-Jihadi Islami operative arrested in Baguiati on Sunday, obtained an Indian passport by submitting forged documents and used to visit Bangladesh at least four times a year, said his interrogators.         
	The Criminal Investigation Department suspects that Ibrahim, who had settled in India at least six years ago, used to provide logistics support to members of the terror outfit when they were in the city. He lived in Atghara, Rajarhat, for two years before moving to Baguiati.        
	Ibrahim used to receive money through hawala operators. We are verifying the information that he provided to us in the past 24 hours, said an officer.

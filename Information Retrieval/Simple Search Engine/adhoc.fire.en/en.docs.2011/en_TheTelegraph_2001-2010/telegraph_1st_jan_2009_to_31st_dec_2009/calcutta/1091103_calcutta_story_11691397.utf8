          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two schoolgirls of Manohorpukur Road played out an abduction drama for 20 hours, fooling their parents and cops.         
	All the while, the duo were within 2km of their south Calcutta home.        
	Rimjhim, 14, and Ria, 11 (names changed) left their houses around 8.30pm on Sunday while their parents were away. Tipped off by a caller, the family members reached a neighbourhood park around 4.30pm on Monday and brought home the girls.         
	The police said the girls told their parents that they had spent the night on pavements.        
	When they did not return even at 10pm on Sunday, we called Rimjhim on her cellphone, said Rias mother.        
	The girls first told their parents that they would return home soon but then kept saying that a woman had kidnapped them when they went to meet a friend in Ballygunge and kept them hostage in Dum Dum.        
	The families lodged a missing persons diary with Tollygunge police station late on Sunday. Early on Monday, a police team was sent to Dum Dum while three more teams fanned out across south Calcutta.        
	But sleuths soon came to know by tracking Rimjhims cellphone that the duo had been in areas closer home, such as Raja Basanta Roy Road, Dhakuria and Purna Das Road.        
	Around 4.20pm on Monday, a neighbour of the girls got a call from a friend who said the two had been spotted near Safari Park on Southern Avenue.        
	Swapan Nath, who often visits the girls neighbourhood, recalled: I became suspicious seeing the duo roaming around as I had just heard at a cellphone shop that two girls were missing. I knew the girls as they live close to my friends house. When I called up my friend, he confirmed that the two could not be found since last night.        
	Naths call to his friend ended the ordeal of Rimjhim and Rias parents.

                      The story of Bharata Natyam                    Adancer can experience the absolute ecstasy of Bharata Natyam when the body transforms into a manifestation of eternal joy along with an expression of bhavas and rasas articulated through a delicate modelling of limbs and gestures. Breaking away from its earlier religious associations, this classical art form has yet retained its purity. A tradition in itself, Bharata Natyam celebrates rhythm, footwork, gestures and story. It is also powerful enough to have a cathartic effect on its rasikas. Todays programme comprises a workshop and a Bharata Natyam recital by Delhi-based artiste Rini Aich. A passionate devotee of this ancient and enchanting form of the performing arts, she combines a natural talent and meticulous approach with a truthful integrity, imbibing and expressing its true richness, delicacy and profundity. At this afternoons workshop, to be conducted for the children of Udayan Care in the form of a lecture-demonstration, the young dancer will speak about the origin and evolution of Bharata Natyam and also on the nuances of its postures and hastas while demonstrating them. Substantiating every stage of her explanation with dance steps, Aich will discuss at length how the various applications of hastas help to keep the body fit.

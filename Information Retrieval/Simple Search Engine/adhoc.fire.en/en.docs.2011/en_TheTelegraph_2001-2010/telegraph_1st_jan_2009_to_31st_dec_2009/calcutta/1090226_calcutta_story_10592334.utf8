          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Doctors at SSKM Hospital operated on a seven-year-old girl on Tuesday and removed a plum seed lodged in her bronchus  a branch of the windpipe leading to the lungs.        
	Sumanta Dutta, who operated on Amina Khatoon, said the seed had been wedged in a way that it was not possible to extract it with forceps.         
	Ten doctors of the ENT and cardio-thoracic departments dissected the bronchus to extract the seed. The procedure, which continued for two hours, is called thoracotomy. The child skin was turning blue because of deoxygenated haemoglobin in the blood vessels, Dutta said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cruise binds then amp; now
                                                                                                                     Young Metro              FOR STARTERS

	Cruise binds then amp; now        
	Tandra Chakraborty has been staying at Navanir, an old-age home in Tollygunge, for the past six years.         
	Her life is happier now, unlike the times when she would be left to guard the house while family members headed for a day out.         
	October 9 was her moment in the sun, as she joined 59 inmates from Kalyan Asram and Navanir in Chetla, Tollygunge Home and Shantinivas, Behala, for a launch ride on the Hooghly.

	Thirty students from five schools, including La Martiniere for Boys, St Thomas School for Boys, Kidderpore, Lakshmipat Singhania Academy (LSA), Army Public School and St Francis Xavier School, accompanied them on the river to celebrate World Elders Day, held on October 1 every year.         
	Organised by NGO HelpAge India, the three- hour and 30 minute ride from Outram ghat to Dakshineswar ghat packed in a cake-cutting ceremony to mark the day, a game of Passing the Parcel and an impromptu dance session with the young and old joining in to shake a leg.         
	We wanted to make the elderly feel cared for. The cruise will strengthen inter-generation bonding at a time when the concept of joint families is fast eroding, said Susmita Ghose, the national director (east and north) of HelpAge India.         
	In the past, the NGO has organised horse carriage rides and trips to amusement parks for the elderly.         
	We cant take away loneliness, but we can give them a few happy hours by spending time with them, said Saket Goenka, a Class XI student of LSA.        
	Seventy seven-year-old Arun Chatterjee of Navanir, Chetla, had a thought for those not as privileged: At least we have the option of going on such trips. But there are many who have nothing to look forward to and no one to care for them.

	The winners received a laptop each. The runners-up from National Gems Higher Secondary School received a digital camera and digital photo frame.   
	The national finals are to be held in Bangalore in November.

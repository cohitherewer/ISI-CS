The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | English gets a career boost
                                                                                                               English gets a career boost
          OUR BUREAU                              
	English has won top honours among admission-seekers this season, with the demand for teachers in the subject in south Asian countries and West Asia spurring the scramble to study Shakespeare.        
	The number of applicants for English honours has almost trebled in the last three to four years. This year we have received 3,100 applications for just 60 seats, Father Felix Raj, the principal of St Xaviers College, told Metro.        
	Seats in the English departments of other colleges in the city are also in demand. The average annual increase in the number of applications is 700 to 800.        
	English teachers are now much-sought-after in countries like Japan, China, Thailand and the UAE, which has raised the demand for English honours among students here, said Father Felix Raj.        
	Ananda Lal, the head of the department of English at Jadavpur University, confirmed that better job prospects abroad had contributed to the subject being the clear favourite in the humanities stream.        
	We receive a lot of enquiries about our students from West Asia and Singapore. There is a demand for English teachers in those countries, and India definitely fulfils that need, added Lal.        
	Jadavpur University has received around 2,700 applications for 50 English honours seats despite raising the cut-off mark in the subject from 65 to 70 per cent.        
	Teaching is not the only option for those who study English literature. The basket of career opportunities now available to English honours students is the key behind the popularity of the subject,        
	Students do not want to narrow down their career opportunities from the beginning. After three years of studying English, they can explore various options, said Lal.        
	With campus recruitment becoming the norm even in the arts stream, students of English are being snapped up.        
	English graduates from Presidency College and Asutosh College have been getting offers not just from media houses and HR firms, but also in IT and other businesses.        
	There is a huge demand for our English graduates in companies like Cognizant Technology Solutions, Tata Consultancy Services, IBM and Wipro. Good job offers have perked up interest in the subject, said Dipak Kar, the principal of Asutosh College.         
	Asutosh received 1,600 applications for its 70 seats this year, 51 of which were snapped up on the first day of admissions. I dont think we will need to bring out a second list, said Kar.        
	At Presidency, the number of applicants has increased from 1,800 last year to 2,500 this season.        
	Debalina Banerjee, the head of the department of English at Presidency, attributed the rush to rising awareness about career opportunities.         
	The opportunities for English graduates are not restricted to media and academia. Students have become aware of this, said Banerjee.        
	According to her, even students applying for seats in engineering, physics, chemistry and economics consider English a second option.        
	It helps that Calcutta University has no strict rules for applying. English does not need qualifying marks in related subjects. That helps, said John Abraham, the principal of Scottish Church College.

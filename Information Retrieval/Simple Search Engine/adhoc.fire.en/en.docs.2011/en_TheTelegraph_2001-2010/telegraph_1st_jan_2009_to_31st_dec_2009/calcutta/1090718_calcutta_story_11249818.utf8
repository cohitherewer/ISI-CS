The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tales of agony on tracks 
                                                                                                               Tales of agony on tracks 
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Three-year-old Md Soherun was in a general compartment, 61-year-old Sambhu Gupta was in an air-conditioned one. But as minutes turned to hours and the Saharsa-Sealdah Hatey Bazare Express remained stranded at Naihati station on Friday, there was little to separate the feverish child and the middle-aged cancer patient in terms of suffering.        
	Soherun, the child of a contract labourer, was running a high temperature and vomiting when the train came to a halt at Naihati early on Friday. On hearing that the train wouldnt proceed until the bandh ended, parents Md Mansur and Khajina Bibi panicked.        
	Soherun was not only running a temperature but also vomiting continuously and having difficulty breathing. We were scared because we were helpless, recalled Khajina after arriving in Sealdah more than 11 hours later than scheduled.        
	A desperate Mansur ran to the stationmasters office with his son, where railway medical staff attended to him. He was put on antibiotics and anti-vomiting pills.        
	Soheruns condition could have deteriorated beyond control because of dehydration and other complications had medical staff not been at hand to treat him, one of the railway doctors said.        
	Several others among the 175 stranded passengers took ill during the period the train was stranded at Naihati. Businessman Gupta, who has oral cancer and was coming to Calcutta for chemotherapy, said he felt increasingly unwell after the air-conditioner stopped. I am so weak that I couldnt even get out of the train, he said.        
	Tarak Nath Banerjee, a 59-year-old engine driver who was to be admitted to the railway hospital at Garden Reach in the morning for cancer treatment, was stranded on the Koraput-Howrah Express at Chengail station. The bandh sapped me of the little energy I had, he said.

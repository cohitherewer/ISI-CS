The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rule rein on tarmac traffic
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Rule rein on tarmac traffic
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Flights and fliers are at risk at the city airport with too many vehicles plying on the tarmac and rules being flouted regularly.        
	Congestion on parking bays, taxiways and in adjoining areas, which comprise the tarmac along with the runways, coupled with rash driving have prompted the directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA) to direct the airlines to impose restrictions on vehicles.        
	The decision was taken at a meeting between A.K. Chopra, the joint director-general of civil aviation, Delhi, and representatives of the airlines and the Airports Authority of India in the city last week. Several measures have been prescribed (see box) to the airlines to reduce hazards on the tarmac. The fewest possible vehicles should be allowed in the operational area, speed governors must be installed and those working in the area have to wear fluorescent jackets, said H.N. Mishra, a senior air safety officer (eastern region) of the DGCA.        
	Similar measures are in place at the Delhi and Mumbai airports. The airlines operating out of Calcutta have three months to implement the runway rules.        
	Thirty to 35 vehicles break tarmac traffic rules every month, said an airport official. The most common violation is crossing the taxiway while an aircraft is on the move.        
	In August, a stepladder crashed into a stationary JetLite plane with 25 passengers on board in the parking bay. Last week, a luggage trolley hit an empty passenger coach.        
	The count of ground and equipment vehicles at the Dum Dum airport has trebled in four years. The vehicles include coaches ferrying passengers to and from aircraft, cargo trolleys, aircraft refuelling vans, catering vans, stepladders and more.        
	Luggage trolleys and other vehicles have come dangerously close to moving aircraft. Complaints have been lodged against the drivers, said a senior pilot of a private airline.

                                                                                                               One child in 10 prey to asthma
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The Metro report on Apeejay School making face mask a part of uniform. The foul city air aggravates asthma                                  
	One in every 10 children in Calcutta of age five to eight years is suffering from asthma, a study has revealed.        
	The ailment, genetic in most cases, is aggravated by the citys foul air which is rich in pollutants. Among the other aggravating factors are smoking and the presence of allergants in the atmosphere.        
	The study, conducted by the respiratory chapter of the Indian Academy of Paediatrics, covered more than 1,000 pre-school and school-going children and was conducted over a year.        
	The findings, to be published soon, show that 10 per cent of the children in the age group of five-eight years are suffering from mild to acute asthma, said Goutam Ghosh, a consultant paediatrician and the national chairperson of the academys respiratory chapter.        
	The study reveals a lack of awareness about prevention and treatment of asthma among the school authorities and parents. The study came across asthma-triggering factors in more than 90 per cent of the schools, an indication of the lack of awareness about the ailment, said Ghosh.        
	Academy secretary K.K. Ghosh said most schools in Calcutta and the districts did not follow asthma-management guidelines. Schools must maintain a report card of students suffering from asthma. The card should be filled up by the doctors of asthmatic children.         
	Guidelines issued by the academy said schools should keep in their custody asthma-management kits, which include inhalers, and first-aid kits. Awareness is the key to tackling asthma and avoiding crisis situations, said Apurba Ghosh, the director of the Institute of Child Health.        
	The academy has written to the All Bengal Teachers Association, requesting it to organise interactive sessions between doctors and the school authorities.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 48 hours for phones 
                                                                                                               48 hours for phones 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta Telephones has set yet another deadline for the restoration of landlines, leased lines and broadband links that went out of order following the blaze at the Circus exchange on July 7.        
	BSNL board director (consumer fixed asset) Rajesh Wadah, who flew down from Delhi on Thursday and met senior officials here, said all affected domestic lines and broadband links must be restored within two days and leased lines within five days.        
	The authorities had earlier set a weeks deadline for the restoration of all affected links. A day after the deadline ended on Wednesday, around 25,000 landlines, 4,000 broadband connections and a large number of leased lines in the Park Street, AJC Bose Road, Picnic Garden and Bondel Road areas remained out of order. BSNL sources attributed the delay in restoration to non-availability of equipment and connection records.

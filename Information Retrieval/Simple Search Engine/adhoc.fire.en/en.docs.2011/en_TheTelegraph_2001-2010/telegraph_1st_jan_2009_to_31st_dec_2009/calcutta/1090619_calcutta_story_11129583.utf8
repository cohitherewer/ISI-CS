The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hit by heat amp; power cuts
                                                                                                               Hit by heat amp; power cuts
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The temperature and relative humidity shot up yet again on Thursday, ending the short-lived relief of Wednesday evenings thunderstorm. The discomfort index touched 66.7 degree Celsius, 12 points above normal, and power cuts made matters worse.        
	The thundershower only made the night slightly cooler. Thursday was uncomfortable and Friday will be no different, though temperatures may be slightly lower because of a cloud cover, said the weatherman.        
	The mercury climbed to 37.3 degree Celsius, three points above normal, on Thursday. The minimum temperature, thanks to Wednesday evenings rain, dipped four points below normal to 23 degree Celsius. The relative humidity ranged between 55 and 98 per cent.        
	The monsoon flow might be activated early next week but that can be confirmed closer to the weekend, G.C. Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore, told Metro.        
	Wednesdays rainfall also did not lower the demand enough to avoid power cuts. Despite generation to almost full capacity on Thursday, large parts of the city had to suffer rotational power cuts for 60 to 90 minutes.        
	The hot weather since this morning has led to a surge in demand for power, said a CESC official.        
	As of 4.30pm, the total demand met was 1,314MW. Because the total demand was to the tune of 1,444MW, rotational loadshedding had to be resorted to, said a CESC source.        
	The shortfall was mainly because of a dip in supply from other agencies, he added. The power situation worsened since early afternoon. The shortfall at 12.30pm was 65MW.

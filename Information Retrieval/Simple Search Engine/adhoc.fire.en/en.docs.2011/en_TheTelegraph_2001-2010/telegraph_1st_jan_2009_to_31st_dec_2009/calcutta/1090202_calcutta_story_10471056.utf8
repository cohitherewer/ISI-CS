                                                                                                               Lorry mows down man
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 24-year-old trader was killed on Sunday morning when his motorcycle collided with a speeding lorry on Syed Amir Ali Avenue, near the Park Circus seven-point crossing.         
	Police said the accident occurred around 5am when Ripun Chakrabarty, a resident of Jadavpur, was heading towards Park Circus on his two-wheeler.        
	He was on his way to buy garments from a wholesale market in north Calcutta. He was supposed to return by 8am and open his shop in Jadavpur, said an officer of Karaya police station.        
	Both vehicles were moving in the same direction. The lorry hit Chakrabartys motorcycle from behind. He was thrown off the motorcycle, which was smashed, said Pradip Chatterjee, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).         
	The two-wheeler got stuck under the lorry and was dragged a few metres before the driver slammed the brakes.        
	The man jumped off his cabin and tried to flee but some residents out for morning walk caught him. He was handed over to the police, said an officer. The vehicle was impounded.        
	Chakrabarty sustained injuries on his head and chest. One of his hands was broken and he had multiple fractures on his skull, added an officer. He was taken to National Medical College and Hospital within 10 minutes but was declared brought dead.         
	Poor visibility because of morning fog could have caused the mishap.        
	Accidents are common on city roads on winter mornings. Since traffic policemen are not deployed on the road before 6am, motorists flout road rules and do not follow safety measures, said a police officer.        
	Run over: Nemai Das, a 40-year-old resident of Lake Town, was run over by a speeding private bus on route 3C/1 while crossing the road near Patipukur railway overbridge around 11.30pm on Saturday.        
	He was rushed to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival. The bus was impounded but the driver fled.

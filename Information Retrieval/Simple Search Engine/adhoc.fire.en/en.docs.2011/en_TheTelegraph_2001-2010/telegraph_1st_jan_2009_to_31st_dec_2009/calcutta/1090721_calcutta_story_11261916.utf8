                                                                                                               Officer shunted out after custody death
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The officer-in-charge of Alipore police station, Jawaharlal Dholey, was shunted out following the death of an accused in the lock-up on Sunday. During an inquiry, senior officers found Dholey had failed to supervise the actions of two cops assigned to keep a watch on the accused  Shambhu Das, 23. Dholey has been transferred to the Special Branch.         
	On Sunday night, a sub-inspector and a constable were suspended on the charge of negligence that might have led to Dass death and a departmental inquiry was ordered against them.         
	The police also started a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder on the basis of a complaint lodged by Dass family. The complainant accused Dholey and two cops  Prithwiraj Bhattacharya and Bishap Mukherjee  of torturing Das to death.        
	A post-mortem was conducted on Monday and we are awaiting the report, said city detective chief Jawed Shamim.        
	Das, termed a drug addict by cops, was arrested on July 17 on the charge of stealing and remanded in police custody. He was found hanging from the ceiling of the lock-up with a piece of cloth torn from his trousers.

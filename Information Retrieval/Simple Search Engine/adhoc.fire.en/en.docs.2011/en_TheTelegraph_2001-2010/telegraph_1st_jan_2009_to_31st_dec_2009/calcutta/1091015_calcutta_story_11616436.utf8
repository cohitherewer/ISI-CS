The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Vedic murder charges
                                                                                                               Vedic murder charges
          A STAFF REPORTER                               Realtor Raj Modi and (above) land shark Gaffar Mollah				                                 
	Police framed charges for the Vedic Village flare-up on Wednesday, paving the way for realtor Raj Modi and land shark Gaffar Mollahs trial in a murder case that opened a can of worms regarding land deals in boomtown Rajarhat.        
	The chargesheet submitted by North 24-Parganas police in Barasat court holds 14 people responsible for the circumstances leading to the death of 19-year-old Amirul Sardar during a football match next to the luxury resort-cum-bungalow complex on August 23.         
	Rahul Srivastava, the superintendent of police of North 24-Parganas, said four of the accused  including Gaffars main associate Khude  were absconding.        
	Modi was arrested a week after the incident while Gaffar, who had gone into hiding, was traced to Bankura along with five other accused on September 8.         
	The chargesheet mentions murder as the primary charge under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code, followed by illegal possession of arms and criminal conspiracy, an investigator said.         
	Amirul, a vegetable vendor, died on being hit by a bullet fired by one of Gaffars men after the team being backed by the land shark lost the match.         
	An officer who interrogated Gaffar quoted him as saying that he and his henchmen took offence when the crowd jeered at them in the presence of constables.         
	A furious Gaffar then ordered his mastan bahini (gang of toughs)  Ranjit Shee alias Rono, Lakshman Ghosh, Ahmed Gazi alias Haran, Hasanujjaman alias Mintu, and Kelobabu  to teach the villagers a lesson. A bullet fired by Lakshman killed Amirul, who had stopped to watch the match along with his brother Monirul while returning home from Golbagan Bazar in Belghoria.         
	All five gang members directly involved in that incident have been arrested along with Bangsi Mandal alias Natabar, who drove the hired Tata Sumo in which Gaffar escaped that very night.        
	Gaffar used to drive a van-rickshaw  and then a lorry  before turning into a land shark for realtors keen to ride the North 24-Parganas property boom.        
	Modi, held accountable for the cache of weapons and ammunition stockpiled in a disputed section of the Vedic Village premises, is also under the scanner for using Gaffar to acquire land from unwilling farmers in the vicinity of the resort.         
	The land-grab allegations against Modi have since prompted the state government to scrap the Kolkata Links IT township project that he was supposed to anchor.

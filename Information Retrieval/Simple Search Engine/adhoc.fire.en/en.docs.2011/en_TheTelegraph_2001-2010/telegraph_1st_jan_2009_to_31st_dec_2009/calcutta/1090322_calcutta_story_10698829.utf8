The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Taxing times for Bijon
                                                                                                               Taxing times for Bijon
										      Stage                        
	Pay Rs 1 crore and 60 lakh and become the owner of Bijon Theatre in Hatibagan. Alternatively, you could foot a Rs 40 lakh corporation tax bill and be a part of an effort to create a modern AC auditorium in what was once Calcuttas theatre para.         
	Even as Bijon Theatre bursts into life with the 10-day full-length theatre competition (March 20-29) organised by theatre group Sayak, its director Meghnad Bhattacharya admitted that if something was not done soon the 30-year old theatre address would fall to land sharks like the rest of the auditoriums in the area.         
	The owners of the land and the hall say they are unable to pay municipal taxes (now amounting to Rs 40 lakh) and want to sell out. This comes as a bolt from the blue for the four groups Sayak, Anya Theatre, Sohan and Theatre Workshop, who have been struggling to keep this place going for the last five years, said Bhattacharya. His group had found the land for Nataraj Enterprise to build Bijon in 1977.         
	He said each group spends nearly Rs 60,000 a year to run the place, of which not even half is recovered. Things would improve if the number of seats is reduced and air conditioners are installed. Modernising the auditorium would uplift performances and increase footfall, he added.        
	The theatre groups managed to get a donation of Rs 12.5 lakh from the local MPs area development fund, but then came the tax bombshell. Unless the tax is paid, the funds for renovation will not be released.         
	Bijon Theatre has hosted several groups and been the venue of countless theatre festivals, workshops and seminars. For the full-length play competition every two years, 10 original plays are selected from around 40 entries on the basis of the script and the groups history.         
	Cash prizes are given to the best production, playwright, director, actors and backstage hands. This years competitors are Ajker Theatre, Belghoria Ethic, Goyeshpur Manchasena, Kalyani Kalamandalam, Sanskar Bharati Repertory, Unity Malancha, Ekushe Satak, IFTA, Chokh and Uhini.       SEBANTI SARKAR

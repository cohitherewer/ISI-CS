The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | B-school tricks of the family trade 
                                                                                                               B-school tricks of the family trade 
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Bikram Dasgupta                                  
	The city-based Globsyn group is set to start a B-school for those running family businesses.         
	The Asian Institute of Family Business will operate from the existing campuses of Globsyn Business School in Calcutta and Ahmedabad, starting November. The institute, an official said, will focus on research, education and advocacy of family-run businesses in India.        
	The courses will range in duration from three days to two years.         
	The short-term courses will deal with succession planning, sibling partnership, cousin consortium, family business governance, wealth management and other topics.        
	The institute will also offer long-term postgraduate programmes in family business management and start-up management.        
	Owners, managers and associates of family businesses will be eligible to pursue the courses. Applicants need to be graduates.        
	The success and survival of a business, whether it is run by a family or by professionals, depends on skilful management and a proper succession plan. In India, nearly 70 per cent of the listed companies are managed by families, said Globsyn group chairman and CEO Bikram Dasgupta.        
	The first course, on succession planning and management, will start in November, added Dasgupta.        
	The institute is yet to finalise the curricula of the courses. The programmes will be developed on the basis of research by a team of dedicated professionals exposed to the nuances of running family businesses.        
	There will be different programmes for family businesses of different sizes. We will focus on case studies and also offer tailor-made short-term courses, said Dasgupta.        
	The institute has tied up with Family Business Institute in North Carolina, The Lyles Centre for Entrepreneurship and Innovation in California, Institute of Applied Entrepreneurship in Coventry, and Family Firm Institute in Boston.

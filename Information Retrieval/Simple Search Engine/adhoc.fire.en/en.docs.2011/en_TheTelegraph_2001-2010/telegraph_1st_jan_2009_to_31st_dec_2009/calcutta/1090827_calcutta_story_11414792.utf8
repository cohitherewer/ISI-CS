                      The real, abstract and beautiful                    Modernist practice of art in our age coexists with peripheral, alternative practices. However, that style which follows the middle path and defines itself as an extension of conventional studio art enjoys the most advantage, as it brings together the best elements of contemporary practice with the innovations of experimental art. The ongoing exhibition of painting and sculpture by a group of three artists represents the dialogue between these two complementary styles. Painter Ananda Addhyas works show the relation between objective and non-objective forms. The unique juxtaposition of abstract and representational art in his paintings forms the quintessence of Indian modernist tradition. Essentially modernist in nature, the sculptures of Rathin Dey (a sculpture by him appears here) depict an interesting use of objects found in nature. His works present the act of selecting objects as motifs representative of ideas. The same is significant in Jayanta Bhattacharyas sculptures. His use of balloons and air-pumped gloves is metaphoric. His works illustrate concepts related to loneliness, fragility and vulnerability. What is remarkable about the two sculptors is their sensitivity in selecting all that is beautiful in nature as tools of symbolism.                  Event: An exhibition of paintings and sculpture by three artists When: Till August 28; 3 pm - 8 pm Where: Academy of Fine Arts, New South A Gallery

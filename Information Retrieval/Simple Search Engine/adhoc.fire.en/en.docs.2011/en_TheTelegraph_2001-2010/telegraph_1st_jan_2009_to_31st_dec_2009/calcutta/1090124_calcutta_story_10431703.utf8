	Calcutta girl Sohini Roychowdhury trained under Bharatanatyam stalwarts Thankamani Kutty and Guru Venkitt for years, but she always wanted to go beyond the traditional contours of the dance.         
	On Saturday, Calcutta will get a glimpse of her innovative blend of Bharatanatyam and Flamenco, a Spanish dance with rapid, audible footwork. The dancer, who is based in Madrid, is in town with her troupe, Sohinimoksha, to perform at the Calcutta Club International Evening, presented in association with The Telegraph.         
	Last July I was performing in the city when the authorities of Calcutta Club approached me, said Sohini, who is in her early thirties.         
	Flamenco has often been blended with kathak but never with Bharatanatyam, which is conventionally a slow-paced dance. In fusion, we perform Bharatanatyam to the beat of six, to make it faster. It is difficult but it feels good, she smiled.         
	The dancer, whose family lives on Canal Street, moved to Spain three years back, when her husband relocated for his work. Europe was not a new territory to Sohini as she had been travelling across Europe for years, performing and conducting workshops.         
	In Madrid she started Sohinimoksha with an eclectic mix of dancers of American, Spanish and Iraqi origin. I believe in the free spirit, in liberating oneself, in going out of the box thats what moksha is all about, she said.         
	Her choreography is steeped in Indian and Greek mythology, the mystic and classical temple dances and Indian epics and legends.        
	Speaking on Mayas Dream, the piece Sohinimoksha will perform at Calcutta Club, Sohini says, Maya in the Vedas is the mother goddess, of whom were born Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. It also means illusion.         
	In Mayas Dream, Sohini plays Maya, a young girl who sleepwalks into a ruin and discovers sculptures of dancers. As she touches them, each one awakens and begins dancing. She is mesmerised and soon joins them.        
	The music is a blend of Mozart, philharmonic orchestra, Carnatic and North Indian Classical and Gregorian and Vedic chants. It is pure Bharatanatyam and pure Flamenco, but we are playing with the rhythms, said Sohini.

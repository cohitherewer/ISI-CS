The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Non-credit courses at JU
                                                                                                               Non-credit courses at JU
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Good news for Jadavpur University students keen on expanding their knowledge base beyond regular courses.        
	The executive council of the university on Wednesday decided to introduce non-credit courses on a host of subjects, including music, dance, drama, sound designing, videography, painting and rural technology.        
	In this rapidly changing world, students should be given an opportunity to develop their skills in co-curricular activities. The concept of non-credit courses is new in our country. We will model our courses on those offered by universities in advanced countries, said P.N. Ghosh, the vice-chancellor of Jadavpur University.         
	The courses are called non- credit because they are not compulsory and students will not be awarded grades or marks. The courses  each of six-month duration  will start from the next semester starting December.        
	The courses will be optional but there will be a column in the marksheet where the students performance in these courses will be mentioned, said Ghosh.        
	Classes will be held in the evening to ensure regular academic activities are not disrupted. The fee per course has been fixed at Rs 1,500.         
	Students from all three streams  engineering, science and arts  can enrol for the non-credit courses.        
	A student from any faculty and from any year will be eligible to join the courses, said Parthapratim Biswas, a member of the executive council.        
	Experts in respective fields  mostly outsiders will be hired for taking classes. We have already contacted some artists and theatre personalities, said a senior official.        
	The vice-chancellor, however, said the decision to start a course will depend on the number of students willing to enrol for it. Since we will have to engage experts from outside, it will not be possible to start a course if there are just one or two candidates, said Ghosh. Jadavpur University, he added, will be the first university in the state to offer non-credit courses.

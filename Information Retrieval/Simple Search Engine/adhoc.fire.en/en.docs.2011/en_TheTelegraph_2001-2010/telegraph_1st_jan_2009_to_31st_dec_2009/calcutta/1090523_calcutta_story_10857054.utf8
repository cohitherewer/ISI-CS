The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sops for hospitals to treat poor
                                                                                                               Sops for hospitals to treat poor
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                              
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has offered upcoming private hospitals an incentive package in exchange of a promise to treat the poor at nominal cost.         
	The sops have made the civic coffers poorer by Rs 50 crore, said an official.        
	Over half a dozen major private hospitals are scheduled to come up off the EM Bypass by the year-end, including Tata Cancer Hospital, Desun, AMRI, Okhardt and Eastern India Health Foundation. An institute of neurosciences is coming up at Mullickbazar.        
	The CMC has tried to generate interest about east Calcutta among private healthcare providers by giving them an alluring package of concessions and exemptions with respect to building sanction fees, property tax rate and other fees. The civic authorities will also take up the construction and maintenance of roads, street lights and water supply facilities around the upcoming units, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.        
	A poor patient, however, cannot just walk into a swanky hospital and get treated at a reduced cost; he will have to approach the civic body.        
	A social security cell has been set up in the CMC for the purpose with the mayor and the municipal commissioner as the ex-officio chairman and vice-chairman, respectively. A group of doctors, including the chief municipal health officer, will also be a part of the cell.        
	The social security cell will consider an application for subsidised treatment before referring it to a specialised private hospital. Once referred, the hospital will offer diagnostic services and treatment at a nominal cost. For example, a bypass surgery will be performed at Rs 25,000, said Bandyopadhyay.        
	The CMC has also given the Mullickbazar institute land and other incentives for treating the poor.

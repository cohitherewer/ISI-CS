The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 9-yr-old witnesses mothers murder
                                                                                                               9-yr-old witnesses mothers murder
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The Behala house where Suparna was murdered. (Sanat Kumar Sinha)                                  
	A bank employees wife was smothered to death with a pillow and then hanged from a ceiling fan in her Behala house by three men and a woman whom the homemaker apparently knew.        
	The gang also tried to smother Suparna Mondals younger son Pratim, the only witness to the murder on Tuesday afternoon, but the nine-year-old survived.        
	Police suspect the murder was a fallout of a family dispute though Suparnas husband Goutam claimed money and jewellery were missing from the house.        
	The 38-year-old woman lived in the single-storeyed building on Satyajit Ray Sarani with Goutam, an employee of a nationalised bank, and their sons Pritam, 14, and Pratim.        
	Suparna and Pratim were in the house when the four turned up around 11am on Tuesday, said an officer of Behala police station.        
	The sleuths learnt from Pritam that the three men and the woman were acquaintances of Suparnas relatives in Sirakol, Diamond Harbour. The victim offered them lunch but they refused. The four went away only to return around 2.30pm, the officer said.        
	Pratim told the cops that a quarrel broke out between his mother and the woman. Suddenly, one of the men took out a gun and threatened Suparna. They then smothered her with a pillow and hanged her from the ceiling fan of her bedroom with a sari.        
	The gang also tried to smother Pritam but left the house after he lost consciousness, perhaps thinking that the boy had died. Before fleeing, they locked the main door, said an investigating officer.        
	Pratim regained consciousness around 5pm and found his mother hanging. He cut the sari with a pair of scissors and called neighbours who alerted us, the officer added.        
	A short while later, a man from Sirakol, claiming to be Suparnas relative, arrived at the house. Neighbours took him to be one of the killers and beat him up before handing him over to the police. He has been detained.        
	A preliminary probe suggests the homemaker was killed because of a dispute in the family. We have identified the woman in the group and will arrest the culprits soon, said S. K. Chaudhury, the additional superintendent of police (industrial) of South 24-Parganas.         
	Police sources said the woman was close to Suparnas brother. There was some problem in her parents family but I never imagined she would be killed for that. The cupboard in the bedroom was open and cash and jewellery worth Rs 2.5 lakh were missing, said Goutam.

                                                               Letters
                                 
	Apropos the report Cops behind smokescreen January 12, it is shocking that the deputy commissioner of Enforcement Branch (EB) does not know from where katatel (foul fuel) is procured by auto drivers, even though the sale of the spurious fuel is rampant in the city and its suburbs.           
	Are the commissioners statements trustworthy? However, he has admitted that katatel rackets are surviving under the patronage of political parties and EB officers dont raise their voice fearing for their jobs.           
	Everyone knows that policemen and leaders of the ruling party are jointly benefited from the hafta (weekly bribe) arrangement with the sellers and buyers of the polluting fuel. Citizens should raise their voice to compel chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to take stern action against the 48 police stations in the city so that cops are forced to raid and destroy illegal katatel dens.           
	However, how far the chief minister would be sincere in giving the city a pollution-free atmosphere is doubtful, as the Lok Sabha election is just round the corner. May be he would be more interested in garnering the thousands of votes of the Citu-affiliated union members.

	The decision of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) to reduce the expenditure on power by introducing energy audit is commendable (Energy audit to trim civic power bill, January 7).             
	The CMC has at last realised that its power consumption is excessive. It is alarming that the civic bodys monthly power bill is Rs 11.25 crore. Steps need to be taken to reduce power consumption. But is it necessary to introduce an energy audit by appointing an outside agency? It can be easily conducted by CMC officials.           
	The CMC should prepare a manual to educate officials about judicious usage of energy. The CESCs suggestions may also be sought. If such a manual exists, it should be updated.           
	All departmental heads and others involved in civic maintenance work (like water booster pumping station, drainage pumping station, street lights, etc) need to be properly trained. There is also a need for strong vigilance to prevent the wastage of energy. Street lights and roadside taps should get special attention.           
	If the target of saving energy by 20 per cent can be achieved, a lot of money would be saved, which could be used for improving other civic services.

	It is good to know that the Corporation has taken an initiative to save electricity. It is unfortunate that especially in educational institutions and offices, nobody cares to put off electrical appliances when not in use. Also, many street lights are found switched on during the day. It is because of such negligence that the civic authorities have to pay a huge electricity bill and power cuts have become routine. Thus it is high time the CMC takes steps to stop power misuse. Other municipalities should also follow in the CMCs footsteps.

	Apropos Hooch hub under cop nose, January 6, the fact that more than 28 labourers fell victim to spurious liquor is shocking. We cannot solely blame these men for their tragic end. These poor workers believe drinking will lessen their strain. The government is issuing alcohol permits at random to cater to the well-to-do, but is careless about the poor. To exploit them, some unauthorised vendors, in connivance with lawmen, sell the deadly drinks, denying revenue to the state. One cannot believe that the existence of hooch joints escapes the notice of cops. Involvement of politicians cannot be ruled out either.             
	These dens are often raided by the police and the narcotics department but only for selfish motives.           
	In spite of having a full-fledged department to control the sale of narcotics and drinks, spurious agencies are flourishing. Had there been no deaths, this social malice would not have been unearthed. Some unauthorised joints were brought down by public outrage. But these will spring back into action as soon as the matter fades from public memory.           
	The police commissioner transferred the local OC but the big guns were left untouched.           
	The need of the hour is to ensure sale of affordable and legal country liquor to the poor through authorised vendors. Those responsible for the death of the 28 labourers should also be brought to book.           
	Subhankar Mukherjee,

	The hooch deaths reveal the callousness of the administration towards destroying the illegal liquor business. It is astounding how hooch rackets continue despite tall claims of strict action by cops.           
	On May 29, 2007, Metro had published a report (Crime thrives at Buddha door) of a hooch den located near the chief ministers house. There is perhaps a triangular nexus among illegal hooch producers, political bosses and the police. So, such unlawful activities cannot be stopped unless corruption in the government network is eliminated.

	Fair or foul January 12, was very informative. It has been proved beyond doubt that fairness creams do more damage than good to the skin. Unfortunately in our country, everyone wants to look fair and regard dark skin as ugly and in the process, fairness cream manufacturers rake in millions. The government must chemically examine such creams to find out their side effects and how far they make the skin fairer. In case it is a sales gimmick, the production of such creams should be banned.

	Apropos the picture captioned New ball game, January 13, it was good to learn that former footballer Santojyoti Mitra has taken over as the city sheriff. But given that the post of sheriff is ornamental and a colonial legacy, it should be abolished.

	Apropos Youth thrashed for soiling hospital bed, January 13, doctors and medical staff have long been accused of negligence. But the staff of Medical College and Hospital went a step further and mercilessly beat up a patient. This barbaric act must be condemned. Just a day before this incident, a patient went missing from SSKM Hospital because of the negligence of a Group D worker. Every day patients of state hospital have to suffer because of hospital employees. The nonchalant attitude of the hospital authorities is shocking.             
	Atif Ayaz,
  Serampore                               
	The article Calcutta 2009, dated January 1, wishing for cleaner air and swifter movement for the city, made for good reading. But do Calcuttans expect any major improvement? Certainly not. No substantial progress will be made for want of sincerity in government officials and political leaders. Public interest hardly matters here.             
	The court issues orders on various problems but lack of seriousness among the executing authorities means no timely action is taken on them. Political parties differ on each and every matter, thus delaying even the best development plans. However, we still hope things will improve.           
	D. Mukherjee,

	Two spirited and enlightened young men, Vinay Jaju and Huub Dekkers, are preparing to cycle ride to Delhi (Clean-air mission on two wheels, January 9). Kudos to them for venturing to create awareness about climate change among city schools and colleges.

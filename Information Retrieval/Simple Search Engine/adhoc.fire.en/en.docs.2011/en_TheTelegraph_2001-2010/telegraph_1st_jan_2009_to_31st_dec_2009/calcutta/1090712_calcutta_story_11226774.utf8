                                                                                                               Next weekend you can be at ... Damanjodi
                                          
	Damanjodi in Koraput district of south-western Orissa is surrounded by blue hills, green forests, rippling springs and cascading waterfalls. The area is mainly inhabited by tribals. The beautiful district is however one of the poorest and most underdeveloped areas of the country.         
	Damanjodi can be easily reached from Bhubaneswar by rail. The distance is around 500km. We took the Hirakhand Express and got down at Damanjodi station. In the last part of the journey the train passes through tunnels amid dense forests and sometimes through bright green valleys. From the station, a trekker took us to the National Aluminium Co. Ltd (Nalco) guest house around 5km away. Shuttle cars are also available.        
	There is a rich deposit of enriched bauxite (aluminium ore) and red hematite (iron ore) near Damanjodi. The abundance of aluminium deposits makes it an ideal place for Asias second biggest integrated aluminium extraction plant  Nalco  to set up its office here. A large part of the local population is employed with Nalco. But most of the tribals depend on selling forest wood for their livelihood.         
	Duduma falls, one of the biggest waterfalls in Orissa, is located nearby and is worth a visit. The water cascades down a hill top from a height of around 175 m, generating hydroelectricity.         
	Another place to visit is Sarba Shrikhetra, where a Jagannath temple is situated. It is said the temple was founded during the Kalinga era. There is also the Gupteswar temple nearby, which is a cave shrine dedicated to Lord Shiva.        
	The Nawdapur Jain statue and the 3,000ft high Kolab Dam are other attractions of the area.        
	Damanjodi, situated in the heart of the Eastern Ghats, is covered in dense forests of sal, teak, palash, akashmoni and mohua. The state government promotes kendu plantation, whose leaves are used in the bidi industry. Different wild animals like elephant, bear, leopard, wolf, jackal and wild bore are found in the forests. The area is known for its large elephant population.        
	Various tribes like the Koya, Garba, Kandh, Pan and Bonda live in the area. The Koya and Kandh sects like to celebrate their festivals with music and colour. They play the madal, dhamsa and flute during their festivities.         
	Very close to Damanjodi is Dandakaranya, which is famous as a refugee rehabilitation centre. There are several trekking routes from Damanjodi to different destination in Bastar in Chhattisgarh.         
	October to April is a good time to visit Damanjodi. The red palash flowers and simul along with the greenery makes spring in Damanjodi beautiful. Monsoon lasts here for a long time and has a different beauty.         
	Going         
	The Howrah-Sambalpur Koraput Express reaches Koraput every afternoon. From Koraput, bus and trekker services are available to reach Damanjodi. The Bhubaneswar-Koraput Hirakhand Express also passes through Damanjodi.

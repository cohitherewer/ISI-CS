The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Test report ends 40-hr flu ordeal
                                                                                                               Test report ends 40-hr flu ordeal
          A STAFF REPORTER                          A Metro report on Sutapas experience at the hospital                                   
	Kalyani homemaker Sutapa Bhattacharyas tryst with unpalatable food, dirty toilets and mosquito bites ended on Wednesday afternoon, 40 hours after she was forcibly quarantined at Infectious Diseases Hospital, Beleghata, for suspected swine flu.        
	Relief came in an envelope from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases in New Delhi, containing the report of tests on Sutapas throat and nasal swab samples, which did not reveal the presence of the swine flu virus.        
	The 46-year-old said always knew she did not have the disease. The test result was a great relief only because it helped me to get out of the dingy and dirty hospital, she told Metro.        
	The result arrived from Delhi at 3pm. My husband arranged for my discharge within an hour, she added.        
	Sutapa was packed off to the hospital from Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport on Saturday night on her way back to the city after a holiday in Singapore with her family.         
	The homemaker, who had fever, wanted to leave after signing a risk bond but was not allowed to. She walked out of a quarantined ward  where her family members were also allowed to enter  early on Sunday after doctors did not examine her in over two hours.         
	She was brought back to the hospital on Monday night with the promise that she would be released as soon as her throat and nasal swabs were taken. After I reached the hospital, I was told that I would have to stay till the test result came in, said Sutapa, who cried herself to sleep.        
	The food was so bad that I couldnt touch it and my meals had to be brought from home. Also, the toilet remained unusable. But the hospital authorities provided a pedestal fan that I had requested since the ceiling fans were too small for the large room where I was kept. They also sprayed mosquito repellent because the electric repellent wasnt working and let me use my own bed sheet, she recounted.        
	NRI Sushmita Biswas and her toddler Gibson and Shyamal Sarkar, a carpenter from Dubai, had earlier been put in the isolation ward of the hospital against their wishes on the suspicion that they had swine flu. Tests later ruled out the infection.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Family of 4 found dead
                                                                                                               Family of 4 found dead
          A STAFF REPORTER                          A grieving relative at the Das home. (Pradip Sanyal)                                  
	All four inhabitants of a Haridevpur house were found dead on Monday morning  one hanging from a ceiling fan and the rest bludgeoned.        
	Among the dead was a nonagenarian whose face was caked with blood. The two-storeyed house was locked from the inside when the bodies were recovered.        
	A neighbour said the family, except the old man, was watching a dance contest on TV till late on Sunday.        
	Police, clueless about the sequence of events leading to the suspected suicide and triple murders, said the 63-year-old landlord, Mridul Kanti Das, was found hanging by a towel from the ceiling fan of his first-floor bedroom. A blood-stained iron rod, with a few strands of hair sticking to it, was found in the room.        
	Mriduls wife Nibha, 56, was lying face down on the bed in her ground-floor room, with wounds on her neck caused by a heavy blunt object.        
	The body of the couples 26-year-old daughter Anindita, with similar wounds on the neck, was found in an adjoining room, her head on the lap of 94-year-old Anil Kumar Ghosh, the maternal uncle of her mother.        
	Ghosh, who lived with the family, was found sitting on the floor, his head resting on the bed, faced bloodied by blows from a blunt object.        
	The cops said the three might have been hit by the iron rod found in Mriduls room. The rod has been sent for a forensic test. A murder case has been filed against Mridul/unknown person.        
	Sleuths have come up with two possibilities. What seems most likely is Mridul hanged himself after killing the other family members. But whats puzzling us is how Mridul could reach the ceiling fan, for there was no chair or stool in the room. We are not ruling out the involvement of an outsider though there was no way he could have left the house after committing the crime, said an officer.        
	The cops will question the labourers who are constructing rooms on the first floor.        
	Ajey Ranade, the superintendent of South 24-Parganas police, said: The preliminary investigation is focussing on all possible angles. The exact cause and time of the deaths will be known only after the post-mortem reports come.        
	The sleuths have come to know from relatives and neighbours that Mridul, a former bank official, was depressed for the past few months, but no one could say why.        
	Anindita worked in a senior position in a private bank. Her elder sister is married and lives with her family in Barrackpore, said a neighbour who did not want to be named.        
	The last to interact with the family was next-door neighbour Sushmita Nandi, who talked to Anindita around 10.30pm on Sunday. She told me that she and her parents were watching a TV show. She was quite her usual self, said Sushmita.        
	A milkman alerted neighbours around 9.30am when his repeated knocks on the door went unanswered. The neighbours called Nibhas brother Salil Biswas, who lives nearby.        
	Biswas, with the help of a few labourers, opened the window of Nibhas room and saw her lying limp on the bed. He immediately called Thakurpukur police station.

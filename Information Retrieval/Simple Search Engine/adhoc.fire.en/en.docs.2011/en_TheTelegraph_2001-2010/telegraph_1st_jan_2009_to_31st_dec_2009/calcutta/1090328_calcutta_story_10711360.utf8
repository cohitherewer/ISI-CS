                                                                                                               BA bids bye to city of low yield     - Why Calcuttas lone direct link with London will be snapped on Sunday          SANJAY MANDAL                                                  
	When British Airways takes flight from Calcutta on Sunday, it will mean more than just another direct international air link going off the citys radar.        
	The worlds favourite airline, which had touched down in the city for the first time in the late 1920s, has withdrawn and re-introduced flights several times over the decades. The airlines latest departure, however, bodes trouble for both the travel industry and frequent fliers from the east who have found this direct Calcutta-London flight the most convenient link with Europe and beyond.         
	British Airways leaving is a disaster for aviation in the east. We will soon feel the repercussions, warns Anil Punjabi, the chairman (east) of the Travel Agents Federation of India.        
	With just over 24 hours to go for the last British Airways flight to touchdown and depart  arrival 1.15am on March 29 and departure 5.05am on March 29  Metro compiles a Q amp;A on BA bidding bye-bye.        
	What are the reasons for an airline leaving a city?        
	Low profitability, security issues, low passenger load.              
	What prompted British Airways to leave Calcutta?          
	The official reason is route rationalisation. Apart from Calcutta, the airline is pulling out of Dhaka. This route is not making a profitable contribution to our business and we are unable to sustain it, says a senior airline executive.        
	The real reason is low profitability. The thrice-a-week Calcutta-London flight has had an average passenger load of 70 per cent but yield  or profit margins  has been low. Most tickets, including those for business class, are sold at discounted prices that pinch our bottomlines, says an official.        
	The root of the problem apparently dates back to 2006 after Lufthansa launched a Calcutta-Frankfurt flight. British Airways was soon forced to slash its fares by 30 to 50 per cent.                                
	Is the airline doing better in other Indian cities?        
	Mumbai is the most profitable sector for British Airways and Delhi, Chennai and Bangalore arent doing badly either. The Calcutta route has apparently been hurting the airline despite the average passenger load. Hyderabad is new territory for British Airways, with a London flight being launched on December 6, 2008.        
	Why did many Calcuttans prefer flying British Airways?        
	Timings and flight duration were the clincher. The Calcutta-London flight is not only a direct one but also one of the quickest connections to the US. People flying to London and back will now lose several hours because of stopovers in other cities.        
	Senior citizens visiting their children in the UK and students could be affected the most. The flights London arrival time (11.35am GMT) was ideal for students who had to travel further. They could reach their campuses without a night halt in London, a source of concern for parents.        
	Before British Airways started this service, students had to fly to London via Mumbai or Delhi. Their parents would accompany them to these cities to help with their heavy luggage, adding to the travel costs. Those days could be back, says Punjabi.        
	What alternative does someone flying from Calcutta to London and beyond now have?        
	Air India will start a Calcutta-Delhi-London flight on the same day British Airways flies out. Passengers can also fly to London via Frankfurt by Lufthansa, through Dubai by Emirates and by other airlines through Mumbai and Delhi.        
	What is a frequent flier to London saying?        
	From Calcutta, British Airways was definitely the most convenient way to reach London and the US. My daughter lives in London and I have to travel to the US very often on business. So, British Airways was my only direct flight option from here. The flight timings were convenient as well, enabling one to reach an American city via Heathrow the same afternoon. But more than people like us, students from Calcutta who study in British universities will be affected the most, says industrialist Sanjay Budhia.

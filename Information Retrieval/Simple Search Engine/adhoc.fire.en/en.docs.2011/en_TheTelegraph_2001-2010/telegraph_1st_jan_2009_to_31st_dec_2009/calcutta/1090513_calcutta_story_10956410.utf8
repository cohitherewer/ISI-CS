                                                                                                               Mishap claims two on Setu
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two young men died after the motorcycle they were riding was hit from behind by a truck on Vidyasagar Setu on Tuesday night.        
	Police took the duo to SSKM Hospital where they were declared dead on arrival. They have been identified as Krishna Bahadur Shaw, 40, and Amar Santra, 46.        
	Shaw, of Bankra Mishrapara, was a government employee.         
	Santra was a resident of Bankra Subhas Pally.        
	The truck, after hitting the two-wheeler, rammed into a booth of the toll plaza. The driver and his help could not be spotted. They must have fled immediately after the accident, said an officer of Hastings police station.        
	Police suspect the driver of the Howrah-bound trailer lost control and hit the two-wheeler. Both men on the bike were flung away and crushed under the wheels of the truck.        
	On seeing the goods carrier approaching the toll plaza at a great speed after the fatal mishap, the guards and the person manning the booth ran away.        
	As news of the accident spread, some local residents blocked the road near the plaza. A police contingent reached the spot and persuaded the protesters to remove the blockade.

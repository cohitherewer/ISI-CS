The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Writers works as Left rallies
                                                                            Tuesday , November 17 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Writers works as Left rallies
  - Babus buck decades-old trend          A STAFF REPORTER                          An office room at Writers Buildings with near-capacity attendance during the Left Front rally on Monday afternoon. Picture by Sanat Kr Sinha                                        
	The winds of change are blowing through the corridors of power long before elections can ring in a change of guard.        
	Nearly 70 per cent of the government workforce at Writers Buildings chose to stay put in their offices on Monday afternoon instead of becoming foot soldiers at a Left Front rally on Rani Rashmoni Avenue, marking a departure from a decades-old ritual of allegiance to the party in power.        
	This was unthinkable until a few months ago. We have always known that attending a Left rally was more important for the vast majority of employees than clearing the mounds of files on their tables, said a veteran clerk in the agriculture department, hurrying back to his room after lunch on the second-floor canteen of Block C.        
	Between 55 and 60 per cent of the 6,000-strong Writers Buildings workforce usually attends a Left Front rally at the cost of office work.        
	Sources said the CPM-affiliated State Government Employees Co-ordination Committee, known to be strict about its members attending Left rallies, was far from pushy this time given the current political climate and growing resentment among the workforce over pending DA arrears.        
	We cannot officially ask government staff to attend a party rally. We usually publicise party programmes so that our members come to know about them. But we did not do so this time because of certain issues which I wouldnt like to talk about, Ananta Bandopadhyay, the general secretary of the co-ordination committee, told Metro.        
	Almost 75 per cent of the employees below the rank of section officer at Writers Buildings are members of the co-ordination committee.         
	Those that you see here have always been politically neutral. Whenever we attended a political rally, it was under compulsion, said an upper division clerk in the finance department.         
	So how did he, a regular at Left rallies since 1984, muster the courage to defy convention?        
	We are living in a different Bengal now, he said.        
	A junior colleague said she believed government employees should have the right to be openly neutral.        
	The Left Front is trying to revitalise its organisational network with this show of strength. But I think that we, as employees of the government, should not be a part of that, she added.        
	Although more than half of the government employees at Writers stayed away from the rally, there was no relief for the city from the chaos that rallies trigger.        
	Traffic across SN Banerjee Road, Lenin Sarani, Esplanade East, parts of CR Avenue and APC Road went haywire with the Esplanade crossing being blocked and CPM supporters spilling over from Rani Rashmoni Avenue to the adjacent thoroughfares.        
	Two-stroke autos that should not be seen on the street and new low-floor buses meant to ease the citys transport woes were used to ferry the rally brigade to the venue and back home.        
	This is the second consecutive week that rallies have made life miserable for us on the first working day of the week, said homemaker Mitali Mukherjee, stranded near Esplanade after fetching her daughter from a central Calcutta school.         
	Last Monday, Trinamul played traffic-stopper.

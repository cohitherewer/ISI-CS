The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | She gets a shuttle-car scare
                                                                            Wednesday , November 11 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            She gets a shuttle-car scare
  - Deodorant girls plight makes commuters wary but options limited          TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                                                  
	Women in Calcutta feel unsafe in shuttle cars but limited transport options steer them towards these illegal  but swift and cheap  taxis at the risk of hitching a horror ride, like law student Chandrima Gupta did on Monday.        
	Second-year commerce student Naiwrita Goswami, who usually takes a shuttle car to reach her home near the airport from college, took her mothers advice and waited for a bus on Tuesday. I was scared after reading about that girl (Chandrima) being assaulted by a driver. The bus I boarded was crowded and took double the time a car takes to cover the distance, but I certainly felt safer, Naiwrita told Metro.        
	For Shweta Tomar, a regular shuttle-car passenger from Park Circus to her Salt Lake office, convenience overrules the element of risk. If there were cheaper and faster options, I wouldnt board a shuttle car, said the Jhowtala resident.        
	Around 2,500 illegal shuttle taxis operate from Park Circus, Salt Lake, Gariahat and the Exide crossing. Private vehicles, including hatchbacks and sedans, also pick up commuters along VIP Road and the EM Bypass for less than the fare charged for a ride on an air-conditioned bus.        
	My college friends and I know there is risk involved in taking a shuttle car from Salt Lake, but it will remain our favoured mode of transport till there is a viable alternative. We cannot afford cabs and we also cannot afford to wait an hour for a bus, said up Anuradha, 20, a resident of the township.        
	Officials say all shuttle cars are illegal because they are not registered as commercial vehicles. We do book such vehicles but its difficult to identify them, said DC (traffic) Dilip Banerjee.        
	Women often have to contend with rogue drivers and ill-mannered co-passengers. Four persons usually share the backseat; so you can imagine what it is like for a girl, said a student from Baguiati.

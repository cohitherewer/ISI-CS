                      Rhyme and reason                    Gifted with a natural talent for poetry, Shomshuklla belongs to that breed of contemporary poets who use the commonplace language of regular, daily conversation in their writings. Yet, her simple, everyday words have the magical power to capture our hearts and continue to linger in our memory long after we have finished reading them. Shorn of any extraneous splendour, her simple expressions are not overburdened with figurative speech. On the contrary, her spontaneous outpourings are full of emotion, empathy and passion, often including the experience of the reader with that of the poet. Her pen engages us with the depiction of the visually-appealing world and life around us  the sun and the sky, trees, clouds, birds, animals, streets and markets and, of course, people. Nothing escapes her perceptive mind as she gazes at the sights and sounds around her. Then she looks inwards and conveys to the reader everything that excites her imagination, arouses her pity or leaves her cold. This evening, artist Shuvaprasanna will launch Seconds Before Sunrise (published by Rupa amp; Co.), the third book of poems by Shomshuklla.                  Event: Launch of Seconds Before Sunrise, a book of poems by Shomshuklla When: Today at 6.45 pm Where: Starmark, South City Mall

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mothers punishment kills boy
                                                                                                               Mothers punishment kills boy
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A mother who dangled her eight-year-old son from the terrace of a three-storeyed building to teach him a lesson for being naughty ended up not only losing her grip but also her only child.        
	Sukumar Jana fell to his death from one of the buildings at the Dakshindari Railway Complex in Belgachhia moments after his mother Panchami, 30, was seen taking him to the terrace around 10.30am on Monday, police said.        
	According to a witness who did not wish to be named, he heard the boy screaming and looked up to see him dangling from the terrace while his mother desperately gripped his hands and tried to pull him back.        
	The boy fell to the ground with a thud before any of us could move. The roof of the building does not have protective walls and his mother may have lost her grip on him after failing to maintain her balance, he said.        
	Some residents took Sukumar to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, around 3km away, but was declared dead on arrival.        
	The boy, a student of Class III, was playing with friends on the terrace when Panchami ordered him to come down immediately.        
	She allegedly did not approve of her son playing with some children of the locality and had repeatedly warned him against disobeying her, neighbours said.        
	I saw the boy come running down the stairs and gingerly walk towards his angry mother, like most kids usually do when they are caught in the act, recalled railway employee Kajal Das.        
	Das said he asked Panchami why she was scolding Sukumar as she headed for the stairs, dragging the reluctant boy by his hand.        
	She replied that her son needed to be disciplined. Then I heard her telling the boy, Chhaade otha khub sakh hoyechhe, na? Dara toke dekhachhi (You are fond of playing on the terrace, right? Wait, I will show you). How was I to know that she would do something so dangerous? he wondered.        
	A stunned Panchami and husband Mahendranath, who works in a marble shop at Muchibazar, fled the complex after the tragedy.         
	Sources said Panchami and Mahendranath were in a relatives house in north Calcutta.        
	Abdur Razaak, the officer-in-charge of Ultadanga police station, said Panchami was guilty of negligence leading to death but would not be arrested for culpable homicide.         
	It was an accidental death and a tragedy. We have started a case but dont intend arresting the mother, he added.         
	The couple stay in one of the illegal tiled-roof houses sandwiched between the railway quarters at the sprawling Dakshindari complex.        
	Singer Michael Jackson had invited howls of protest in 2002 when he was seen dangling his infant son from the balcony of a Berlin hotel to amuse his fans who had gathered below. He later apologised for the act, calling it a mistake.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cops get crackdown jitters
                                                                                                               Cops get crackdown jitters
          KINSUK BASU                       PHASE-OUT: YOUR QUESTIONS                          
	The logistics of the foul-fume crackdown weighed down Calcutta police a day before the high courts deadline to get cracking.        
	Seven garages of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) are all that the police have identified so far as dumping grounds for seized two-stroke autos and commercial vehicles 15 years and older.        
	Each of these garages can accommodate a maximum of 70 small vehicles, which translates into space for less than 500 cars and autorickshaws. As of now, we havent even thought about where to keep seized buses, said a senior traffic officer.        
	The seven garages selected by Lalbazar are along Baithakhana Road (near Sealdah), Goragacha Road (near New Alipore mint), Aurobindo Sarani, Palmer Bazar (off Entally), Garden Reach Road (Port area), 83 AJC Bose Road (near St James School) and Mathpukur (off the EM Bypass).         
	Any seized vehicle small or large that is towed to one of those garages must remain there until the court decides what to do with it. This means that the space we have created to keep seized vehicles will be filled up in a couple of days, said an official, mirroring the cluelessness of a force that had thought the crackdown could be delayed if not avoided.        
	The transport department had tried arranging for space, only to goof up.         
	A source said some officials had visited the Taratala CSTC bus depot and the Shyambazar tram depot for a survey one afternoon and designated these as garages for seized vehicles. Someone had to tell them that both places looked empty only because the buses and trams usually parked there were doing duty on the streets.        
	For vehicles seized in South and North 24-Parganas, the only garages so far are the tram depot in Joka and the bus depot at Belghoria.         
	The police are also short of the hydraulic cranes they require to mount an operation of this scale.        
	Its one thing to seize a bus and quite another to tow it away. Our department has only five or six hydraulic cranes for the entire city. The 14 traffic guards have been asked to hire hydraulic cranes for the task at the last minute, said an officer.         
	Apart from cranes, the police need to line up a fleet of lorries to ferry seized autos to the designated garages.         
	The buzz in Lalbazar is that the joint police and public vehicles department (PVD) teams will focus on autos on the first day of the crackdown. The diesel lobbys petition in the Supreme Court will have no bearing on the ban on two-stroke autos. So we intend targeting the autos first, the officer said.        
	Five squads have been formed, one for each traffic police division, to collaborate with the PVDs technical teams. But Lalbazar has yet to devise a strategy to handle possible law and order problems triggered by the crackdown.         
	The Federation of West Bengal Truck Operators Associations has declared a token strike on Friday to protest the phase-out of goods vehicles 15 years and older from the metropolitan area.        
	Around 50,000 trucks will be off the road. The truckers have threatened to go on an indefinite strike if the apex court does not extend the phase-out deadline.  
	Confusion  
	Confusion reigned on Thursday over whether transport operators did file a petition in the Supreme Court on Wednesday. As the green lobby speculated about it, counsel Rani Chhabra sought to clear the air by revealing the ldquo;diary numbers rdquo; of the petition (22192, 22207 and 22262). ldquo;It is coming up for mention on Friday itself, rdquo; she told Metro from Delhi.  
	But green activist Subhas Dutta cited ldquo;defects rdquo; in the petition, corroborated by the court rsquo;s website, to contest her claim.

                                                                                                               Accused leads cops into honey trap amp; flees
  - Girlfriend of undertrial drugs constables with sweets outside SSKM          A STAFF REPORTER                                                   
	Amin Khan might not have heard of Charles Sobhraj but he borrowed a trick from the bikini killers book to fob off some cops and flee from custody.        
	The 32-year-old abduction accused, who was taken to SSKM Hospital on Tuesday for a check-up, sweet-talked two police guards into meeting his girlfriend who was waiting outside.        
	The woman offered them some sweets, eating which the cops slumped to the ground. By the time the unconscious duo  frothing at the mouth  were admitted to the same hospital, Amin and the woman had melted into the crowd.        
	In 1986, Sobhraj had fled Tihar jail after offering spiked sweets to guards on the pretext of celebrating his birthday.        
	As word of Amins escape spread, police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti ordered the suspension of the two constables for dereliction of duty.         
	The constables were supposed to bring him back to the jail immediately after the check-up, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police, detective department.        
	A search has been launched for Amin and the woman.        
	Around 1pm, after the check-up was over, Amin pleaded with the two constables to allow him to meet his girlfriend who he said was waiting near the Harish Mukherjee Road gurdwara. The duo, violating rules, walked the accused to the spot where the woman was standing. The woman then offered the two some sweets. What happened next we do not know but passersby found them unconscious on the pavement, said Shamim.        
	Amin seems to have mastered the art of drugging. In August 2007, he and three other youths  Sandeep Rai, Sanjay Singh and Salauddin Ansari  had drugged and kidnapped a New Market trader. The detective department later took up the investigation and took Amin into custody, said a senior officer.        
	Since his arrest Amin had been lodged at Presidency jail, facing trial for the abduction.

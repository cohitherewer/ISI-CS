The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sourav school faces protest
                                                                                                               Sourav school faces protest

	Residents of Salt Lakes CA block demonstrated on Sunday morning against the school being built by Sourav Ganguly in the area, citing congestion and pollution concerns.         
	The urban development department recently leased out an oval 63-cottah plot at CA222 to the former Team India captain to build an integrated school from the primary to the higher secondary level.         
	The block houses two schools  Haryana Vidya Mandir and Salt Lake School. According to residents, a third school would lead to several problems.         
	Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya threw his weight behind the project. The plot was meant for educational purposes and we have not leased it out for a commercial venture. Its unfair on the part of residents to protest such a cause, he said.        
	We face a lot of problems because of the two schools. Pool cars ply through the block throughout the day and there is perpetual commotion, said Rajat Moitra, a resident of the area.        
	The piling and ground levelling work that started last week continues till 9.30pm, causing sound and air pollution in the area, he added.        
	After demonstrating at the site of Wissen International School, the residents met Souravs relative Sanjay Chatterjee, who is also a member of the upcoming schools administrative body.         
	Residents discussed their problems with me. I will put forward the issues to Sourav on Monday. After discussions, we will sit with the residents and try to carry on the construction with their co-operation. For the time being, I have asked the construction agency to stop work after dusk, said Chatterjee.         
	The plot was earmarked for a college in the township master plan. A college would have attracted lower footfall and caused much less disturbance. Moreover, there are two schools within 50 metres on either side of the plot, said Sunil Chowdhury, the joint secretary of CA Block Citizens Association.        
	The vacant plot served as the parking lot of the two schools. Now vehicles are being parked on the road, leading to snarls, said M.K. Thakkar, a resident.        
	Chatterjee said Sourav had not specifically sought the plot from the urban development department. The municipality had showed us some other plots in Salt Lake but those did not meet the ICSE board criterion of a 60-cottah plot for a school, he said.         
	The protesters said they would move the pollution control board, the municipality and NGOs to shift the school.        
	If the residents come to us, we will forward their case to the urban development department, said Biswajiban Majumder, the chairman of the municipality.

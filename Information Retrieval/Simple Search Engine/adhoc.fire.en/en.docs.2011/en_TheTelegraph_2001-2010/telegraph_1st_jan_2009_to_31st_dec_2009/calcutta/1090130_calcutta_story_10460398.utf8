                    Experiments in music and dance                    It is not often that Calcuttans get a chance to experience the traditional flavour of Indian classical music along with the lively, foot-tapping beats of modern tap dance. A blend of Indian classical with world music and dance, Azmaish... promises to provide this and much more in an experimental presentation that is sure to bowl the audience over. Not another fusion ensemble, each performer in Azmaish will remain true to his original style without attempting to combine it with that of the others. Featuring Ustad Sabir Khan (tabla), Pandit Chitresh Das (kathak), Jason Samuels Smith (tap dance), Pandit Tarun Bhattacharya (santoor), Theo Hill (piano), Pandit Ramesh Mishra (sarangi), Jayanta Banerjee (sitar) and Arif Khan (tabla), it will spin a magical web of rhythmic movements and musical notes.

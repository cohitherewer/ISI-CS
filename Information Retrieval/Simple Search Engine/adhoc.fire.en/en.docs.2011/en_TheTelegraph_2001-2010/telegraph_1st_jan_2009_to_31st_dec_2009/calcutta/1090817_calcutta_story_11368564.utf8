The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Zoo probe draws a blank
                                                                                                               Zoo probe draws a blank
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Police have failed to find clues to the theft of eight Common Marmosets from Alipore zoo on August 9.         
	Interrogation of the two security guards and a zoo employee arrested in connection with the incident did not yield much, said investigators.        
	The arrests are based on suspicion and discrepancies in their statements. We havent found any specific leads into the theft, said city detective chief Jawed Shamim.         
	According to the police, the chances of tracing the marmosets are bleak.         
	It seems that the thieves have smuggled the monkeys abroad. The culprits will not risk selling the animals in India as the news of the theft has spread, said an officer.        
	The cops are yet to ascertain whether the thieves used sedatives in the food given to the animals and whether the net of the cage was cut open from inside.         
	If the experts find that the nets were cut from inside, we can be sure of the involvement of zoo employees, said an investigator.         
	A senior detective department officer told Metro that the forensic report would be available in a weeks time.

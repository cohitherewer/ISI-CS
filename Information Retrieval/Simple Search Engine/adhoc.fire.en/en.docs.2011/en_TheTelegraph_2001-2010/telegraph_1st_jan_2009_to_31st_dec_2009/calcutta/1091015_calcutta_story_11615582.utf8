                                                                                                               Fish-head for century man

	When he was born, Calcutta was still the capital of India, the British had just come up with the Morley-Minto Reforms to restore stability after Lord Curzons partition of Bengal and Mahatma Gandhi was still in South Africa.        
	Deshapriya Park resident Nirmal Mukherjea, who celebrated his 100th birthday on Wednesday, can look back on a century of memories.         
	Surrounded by his family  spread across four generations  and close friends on his big day, Mukherjea cut a huge chocolate cake and shared the secret of his long life. My mother would always give me the head of a fish and ask me to eat the brains so that I would live long, he smiled.        
	Mukherjea has not only lived long but also lived healthy.         
	Hailing from Jessore, Mukherjea came to Calcutta after completing his Matriculation from Bongaon School. He joined St Pauls College and later studied law at Calcutta University. He started practising at Calcutta High Court in 1945. Asked about his memorable cases, he immediately recalled the one he fought on behalf of the king of Nepal, who had been taxed Rs 1.5 crore for his property in Bengal.         
	Mukherjea was the president of the Calcutta Income Tax Bar Association and the secretary of the Federation Hall Society and has penned books on income tax laws.         
	A man of discipline and principles, Mukherjea leads his life by the hands of the clock, says daughter-in-law Koli. Though he is a strict man, he has a soft side to him too, she smiled.         
	The centenarian loves Rabindra Sangeet, so his elder son Probir and daughter Shampa Bhattacharya organised a soiree by Srikanta Acharya on Wednesday, which Mukherjea enjoyed immensely.        
	He once travelled to Santiniketan and met the bard, said a family member.         
	Mukherjee loves watching cricket and football on TV, but what he loves most are sweets and ice-cream. The dessert at his 100th birthday bash  nolen gur-flavoured ice-cream!

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      E-visa confusion grounds couple
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A couple on their way to Australia on honeymoon was not allowed to board a flight at Calcutta on Sunday morning on the ground that they were not carrying valid visas.        
	The couple, residents of Ho Chi Minh Sarani, filed an FIR against Kingfisher Airlines, whose staff prevented them from boarding a flight to Bangkok. From there, they were scheduled to fly another airline to Australia.        
	We were carrying e-visas. All our documents were in order. We were also cleared by immigration officials, said the husband, a city-based businessman who requested not to be named.        
	Its when they reached the aircraft ladder that they were stopped by airline officials who alleged they were not carrying proper visas. After an altercation, the couple returned to the international terminal and lodged an FIR.        
	An immigration official said the e-visas were valid. But a Kingfisher official said: There was confusion over the visas. Today being Sunday, there were not enough personnel who could have scanned the documents. We will check the papers tomorrow. If they are valid, the couple will be allowed to fly.

	A week after Aila brushed past Calcutta, the two greenest clubs in the city are picking up the pieces and putting in place a restoration and re-plantation programme.        
	At RCGC, soggy soil conditions prevented the passage of heavy vehicles needed to lug away the fallen trees obstructing play. The practice, putting and chipping range was cleared last Wednesday with five holes opening on Thursday, nine holes on Friday, and all 18 holes over the weekend. The uprooted trees have been stacked on the sides of the fairway to be cleared over the next 8-10 days.        
	Our aim was to clear the course and make the 18 holes suitable for play by Saturday morning. We bought a chainsaw in addition to axes and regular tools and our staff voluntarily put in extra hours to help move the 70-80 trees that had fallen, said Jaideep Gangopadhyay, the manager of the second oldest golf club in the world.        
	The tree-fall count in nearby Tollygunge Club was 62. Between May 26 and 31, the main entrance path, car park, stable area, the main playing area on the fairway and the path adjoining the 17th fairway were cleared off debris, rubble and precariously hanging branches by Team Tolly.        
	We are in the process of assessing the ground and clearing the debris. We would like to restore some of our beautiful trees, said A.R. Mukerji, the chief executive and managing member of the club.        
	But for some old-timers no amount of restoration will heal the wounds caused by Aila. A senior member was in tears, telling me how years ago he had courted his wife by the now collapsed silver oak, near Fairway 18, said Mukerji.        
	At Tolly, a systematic restoration and re-plantation plan is underway. Golf course superintendent Gaurav Pundir said: The stumps of eucalyptus, gulmohar, peltophorum, jacaranda and sirish will be cut in a slant, keeping the main root system undisturbed. The trees would be erected with hydraulic back-hoe loaders that we will hire.        
	This process will be on, along with clearing of the walking paths, till June 5. Twenty senior members who call themselves Friends of Golf have agreed to pay for 20 trees. We will also involve the members kids in a tree-planting programme that starts on June 11, said Dr Saibal Sen, the club president.        
	As most damage has been done to the shallow-rooted species, the bid will be to acquire aesthetically appealing deep-rooted trees which are hardy, fast-growing, have large rotation and cause less leaf fall, explained Pundir.        
	At RCGC, the re-plantation process starts in 10 days. The plan is to plant three times the number of trees lost. Fast growing-species like Indigofera will be planted first, followed by slow-growing deep rooted species like sirish and gulmohar.        
	We have also lost a few fruiting trees like mango, jamun and bell fruit, that we plan to collect and plant at suitable spots, said Jaideep Gangopadhyay.

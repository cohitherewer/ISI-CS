The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mystery plane flies past
                                                                                                               Mystery plane flies past
  - Blip on airport radar early on Thursday was not an IAF craft          SANJAY MANDAL                                    
	An unidentified aircraft blipped on Calcutta airports primary radar early on Thursday and didnt respond to repeated queries from air traffic control (ATC) as it moved southwest before disappearing without a trace.        
	The ATC team was in a tizzy after the aircraft, spotted 37 nautical miles east of the airport around 3.30am, appeared not to have any transponder to link with the secondary radar that measures altitude and speed. When there was no response from the pilot either, the officials sounded a red alert.        
	We tracked the aircraft till 4am but couldnt find out what type of plane it was and to whom it belonged. We didnt even know whether it had the standard equipment for voice communication with the ATC. So we contacted the Indian Air Forces liaison unit, a senior airport official said.        
	The mystery deepened when the IAF said that the unidentified plane was unlikely to be a defence aircraft on a secret mission or drill.        
	We are working on the information (provided by the ATC) and trying to find out what it was, the chief public relations officer of defence (east), Group Capt. R.K. Das, told Metro on Friday. It couldnt have been an IAF aircraft at that hour.        
	Under normal circumstances, the secondary radar tells the ATC at what altitude and speed an aircraft is flying. But the aircraft must be equipped with a transponder for the secondary radar to be able to do this. The primary radar can track an aircraft even without the transponder but cannot ascertain its altitude and speed like the secondary radar does.        
	An ATC official said all scheduled and non-scheduled (private) aircraft pilots flying through Calcutta or any other citys airspace were required to inform the ATC about their flight plans before takeoff. Calcutta airport had no prior information about an aircraft passing through at that time on Thursday.        
	We do encounter false blips on the radar that are mistaken for unidentified aircraft. But that wasnt the case on Thursday. A false blip is stationary but this one was moving, the official said.        
	He confirmed that there was no problem with the primary radar that night.        
	Sources said if things had gone wrong the unidentified plane could have been involved in a mid-air collision with overflying commercial aircraft. Flights to and from Southeast Asia, Europe and the US pass by at night. We were extra cautious in guiding these flights after spotting the unidentified aircraft, an official said.

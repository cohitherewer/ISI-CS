                      Photography for a better world                    Can photographic images bring about change? It is a very debatable question. Sebastiao Salgado is of the opinion that a photograph alone cannot influence social change. But, a picture combined with a system of information and the organisations that surround it, can. Curated by Drik India, Images for Change, the ongoing all-India exhibition of photographs, highlights human struggle and triumph over poverty, challenges of livelihood, food, security and climate change. It is part of the World Fair Trade Week 2009 programme which has its origins in a movement that wishes to work towards a fair change in the way the world functions today. Eminent photographers like Prasant Panjiar, Swapan Nayak, Sohrub Hura, Kushal Ray, Harish Tyagi, Sudhakar Olwe, Nilanjan Dutta, Dev Nayak, Parthiv Shah, Sucheta Das, Zeeshan Latif and Bijoy Choudhuri (a photograph by him appears here), along with promising names like Tunali Mukherjee, Kaushik Sengupta, Prasanta Biswas and Tushar Sharma have covered the whole gamut of the closely-related but distinctly different human issues of our time. The powerful images at this show will definitely not change things overnight, but as W. Eugene Smith observed, Photography is a small voice, at best, but sometimes, one photograph or a group of them can lure our senses to awareness.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Morning swim fatal for teen
                                                                                                               Morning swim fatal for teen
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 15-year-old boy drowned while swimming in a lake near his Baishnabghata home in Patuli on Monday morning.         
	Apurba Bose, a Class X student of Baghajatin Boys High School, left home around 4.30am telling his family members that he was going swimming with friends. The teenagers had been taking swimming lessons from his father and some friends for the past few days.         
	A preliminary probe suggested Apurba drowned while learning to swim in the Q-block lake. We have lodged an unnatural death case and are awaiting the post-mortem report for confirmation of the cause of death, said an officer.        
	Around 6am, we came to know from some youths in the locality that our son had drowned, said Apurbas father Anup Bose, a state government employee.         
	The youths told the family members that they had spotted Apurba in the lake, floundering to stay afloat and shouting for help. Two of the youths claimed they had jumped in to rescue the teenager. By that time, my son was nowhere to be seen, said Anup.        
	Apurbas body was fished out by divers around 11.30am.        
	His sister was suspicious about the youths account. My brother said he would swim with friends but when we asked them, they said Apurba had dived in alone. He was not a good swimmer and had never swam without our father. How could he dare to swim alone? asked Kaberi, a first-year student of Muralidhar Girls College.        
	Apurba had a fight with our father on Sunday night. He was upset and father allowed him to go swimming, hoping it would cheer him up. I wish he had stopped him, Kaberi added.

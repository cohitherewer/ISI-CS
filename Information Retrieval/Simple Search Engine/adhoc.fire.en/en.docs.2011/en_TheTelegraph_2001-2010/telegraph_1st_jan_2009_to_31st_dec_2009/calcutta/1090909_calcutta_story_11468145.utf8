The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hunger strike over freshers
                                                                                                               Hunger strike over freshers
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Hunger strike on campus hit a new low on Tuesday with Independents Consolidation (IC) supporters at Presidency College using it to protest an instruction by the principal to change the date of a cultural programme they had planned for the new batch.        
	We have made all the plans and booked a band. It is not possible to change the date of the programme at such a short notice, said Anindya Nandi, a third-year student of geology in the college and a member of IC.        
	According to members of the students body, they had scheduled the programme  which is not a freshers welcome  for September 14 after taking verbal permission from principal Sanjib Ghosh.        
	The SFI-controlled students union, which has organised a freshers welcome on September 16, objected to the plan for the cultural programme.Having a second fresher is unjustified, especially when the IC did not get formal permission from the principal, said Richa Gupta, the general secretary of the students union.        
	IC members alleged the principal had asked them to interchange the date of the cultural programme with that of the freshers welcome. He had earlier told us that we could organise the programme on any day other than September 11 and 16, said an IC supporter. Ghosh was not available for comment.        
	To protest what the IC members termed as undemocratic conduct, around 30 students fasted during college hours. Teams of two IC members will be on hunger strike for 24 hours each till the authorities take a fair decision.         
	The principal called a class representatives meeting on Wednesday to discuss the issue.

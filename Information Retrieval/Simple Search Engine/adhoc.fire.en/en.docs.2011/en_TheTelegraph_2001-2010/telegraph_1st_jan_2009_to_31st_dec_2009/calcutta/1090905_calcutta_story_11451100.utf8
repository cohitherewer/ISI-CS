                                                                                                               Probe into admission denial by school

	The state government has started a probe into a fathers allegation that his daughter was denied admission to Class XI of the private English-medium school where she studied as he used to highlight guardians complaints against the management.        
	Manish Ranjan Naha Ray wrote to the governor and the state school education department after his daughter did not find a place on the merit list for admission to the Plus-2 commerce course at WWW Cossipore English School, where she studied from lower KG to Class X.        
	My daughter scored 73 per cent in ICSE this year and fulfilled the admission criteria set by the school. Students with less marks were admitted to the course, said Naha Ray, the former joint secretary of the guardians committee.         
	When I could not find my daughters name on the merit list, I called up the school. The principal told me it was for the school to decided whether to take a student or not. I was also told that my daughter was not being admitted since I used to highlight grievances of the guardians, added Naha Ray.         
	The school education department recently started the inquiry into the incident. The governor had urged the government to probe the allegation and submit a report to him.        
	We cannot elaborate on the findings till the investigation is complete, said Amiya Ranjan Sanyal, the deputy director of Anglo-Indian schools wing of the school education department.        
	Naha Rays daughter has taken admission in another school but is depressed. She was disciplined and obedient. Her conduct was good throughout. She was also a good athlete and won several prizes in sports, said a teacher.        
	J. Bajpayee, the principal of the school, was not available for comment. Anil Kumar, the institutions honorary administrator, refused comment.

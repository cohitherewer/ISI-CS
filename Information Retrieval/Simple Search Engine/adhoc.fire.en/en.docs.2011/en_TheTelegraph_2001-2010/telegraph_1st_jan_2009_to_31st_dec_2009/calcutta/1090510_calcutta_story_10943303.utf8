The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tongue in cheek
                                                                                                               Tongue in cheek
										      eyewitness                        A work by Amritah Sen				                           
	The second half of Tell Tale: Fiction, Falsehood amp; Fact 2 has opened at Experimenter on Hindusthan Road. Curated by Paula Sengupta it has five participants  Amritah Sen, Anupam Chakraborty, Rajesh Deb, Sarnath Banerjee and Sujay Mukherjee.         
	Like the first half of this exhibition, it is a refreshing change from the usual gallery show, more so because there are not too many works on display. Good use has been made of the pit in the middle of the floorspace, although Rajesh Debs sculpture is rather abstruse  or is it muddle-headed?        
	Amritah Sens delightful watercolours made up for this. Picasso, Binode Behari, Sukumar Ray and Parashuram all turn into ingredients of her tongue-in-cheek works. Sujay Mukherjees inflated toys of local and Chinese origin bring to the fore the war of the markets. On the other hand, the humour in Sarnath Banerjees fake Lalbazar papers seems forced. Anupam Chakrabortys norwester is a novelty.              
	The Italian artist Tarshito, who is an architect by training, juxtaposes the stripes of Nagaland shawls with the feminine forms of vases and also with hybridised maps in his large works on display at Bose Pacia gallery. He uses text, quotes from Mother Teresa, Orissa patachitra artists and collaborates with other craftspersons in his works, but the more interesting works were vases composed of ceramic fishes that the artist created in Calcutta.              
	Spontaneity is the hallmark of the photographs of veteran photojournalist T.S. Satyan whose black-and-white prints are on display at Seagull. Be it the image of the goat shaking hands with a man on the steps of a mosque, classical musician Mallikarjun Mansur carrying his grandchild on his back, a bespectacled man in meditation in a garden of weeds in Varanasi, or the dignified tribal woman with her brood, they are all fine examples of the art of portraiture, capturing in a split second fleeting expressions and attitudes.         
	One of Satyans most remarkable photographs is of wrestlers clustering around a man taking a shower of red earth.       SOUMITRA DAS

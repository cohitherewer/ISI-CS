                      Ukranian experience                    What instantly comes to mind when we hear the word Ukraine? Chernobyl, Black Sea, the Dynamo football club.... Home to more than 45 million people, Ukraine is a state in east Europe, larger than France, with a great southern Black Sea coast, the Carpathian mountains to the west and the hub of the heaviest coal and metal industries in Donbas, to its east. At the same time, it is a country steeped in rich culture and tradition, having absorbed the experience of many generations of people who have lived in the country during its long history. Every new generation has added its own vision of the everyday rules of life, thus creating its colourful national culture. It is a place where music, culture and folk art have thrived, mainly because its people love to remain true to tradition, in spite of the fact that they have adopted contemporary lifestyles along with the rest of the world. With Love from Ukraine presents a session of stories and songs from that country, showcasing its glorious heritage in culture and the arts. It features an original slide show on themes of folk rituals, dress and music. Olha Kolomyyets, a musicologist from Ukraine, will also speak on Ukrainian folklore and music. Hosted by Weavers Studio Centre for the Arts and East European Development Institute.                  Event: An evening of songs and stories from Ukraine When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Weavers Studio Centre for the Arts, 94 Ballygunge Place

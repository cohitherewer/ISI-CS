The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 3 wanted for leader murder
                                                                                                               3 wanted for leader murder
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Police are looking for a CPM youth leader and two supporters of the party in connection with the murder of Howrah Trinamul Congress leader Kestopada Bardhan on Sunday.        
	According to the police, the three  Debendra Thakur, Sanjay Thakur and Dharmendra Singh  were named in the FIR and are absconding. Debendra is suspected of masterminding the operation along with a criminal lodged in Presidency jail.        
	Investigators are not sure whether the three were the ones who rode to Bardhans Andul Road office on Sunday morning, shot him and sped off towards Vidyasagar Setu.         
	Sources said Debendra, in his early-30s, was an active member of the SFI from the time he was a BCom student at Dinabandhu College. He later joined the DYFI and started a building materials business in the Botanic Garden area.        
	A local CPM leader who did not want to be named said: Debendra fell out with Bardhan after the senior leader bagged a materials supply contract for a cancer hospital in the area. Debendra and his associates wanted a share of the pie and had threatened Bardhan. Debendra was also angry with Bardhan for opposing the theft of scrap from a factory in the area.         
	Though Bardhan left the CPM and joined the Trinamul, he had good relations with some CPM leaders in the area. He had complained against Debendra to the party bosses, but they took no action because the youth was close to a key member of the party, added the leader. Sources said Sanjay and Dharmendra were supporters of the party.        
	Sukesh Kumar Jain, the additional superintendent of police (town), said: We are exploring all possible angles.

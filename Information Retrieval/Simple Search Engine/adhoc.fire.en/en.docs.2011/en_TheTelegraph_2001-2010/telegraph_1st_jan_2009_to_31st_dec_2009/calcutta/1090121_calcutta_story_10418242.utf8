The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fish friend for troubled teen
                                                                                                               Fish friend for troubled teen
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The building where Anil and Chayanika Ghosh live on the ground floor. A Telegraph picture                                  
	The teenager who attacked his paternal grandparents and aunt with a chopper for allegedly driving his father to suicide would spend most of his time talking to fish in his two aquariums.        
	Nobody in the family had an inkling of a mind in turmoil as he sat alone in front of the aquariums after returning from school, the 14-year-olds mother said after her son was refused bail on Tuesday and sent to a juvenile remand home for two weeks.        
	He will be produced before the West Bengal Juvenile Board again on February 3.        
	Relatives found it difficult to come to terms with the fact that the quiet, studious boy who underwent open-heart surgery five years ago would buy a chopper with the school fees his mother gave him and attack his grandparents and aunt.        
	My nephew is no petulant teenager with a history of violent behaviour, his maternal uncle said.        
	The Class VIII student of an English-medium school in Hazra told interrogators that he had been planning the attack for five months. He kept justifying the act, saying he wanted to avenge his fathers death, an officer at Alipore police station said.        
	The teenager, who lives with his mother and younger sister at his maternal grandparents house in Janbazar, would often visit the Chetla house of his paternal grandparents on his way home from school. But he nursed a grudge against them after hearing relatives talk about how their attitude towards his parents had left his father depressed and suicidal.        
	On Monday, he reached the house around 11.30am and was watching TV after lunch when he suddenly took out the chopper from his schoolbag and lunged at his aunt Baisakhi. He hit her several times on the head, neck and face. His grandmother Chayanika Ghosh was the next victim. The grandfather, 70-year-old Anil Ghosh, rushed out of the bathroom and was hit hard on the head. Some neighbours overpowered the boy.        
	The three victims received between 18 and 41 stitches.        
	At the Janbazar house, relative Gorachand Halder said the boy became quieter than he was after his fathers death last Puja. He was very close to his father and never recovered from the shock of his death.        
	Halder said the family recently enrolled him for a cricket coaching programme to ensure that he mixed with his peers. But he preferred his pet fish to playing outside.        
	The teenagers mother and maternal uncle will visit Dhrubashram, at Ariadaha in North 24-Parganas, on Wednesday to give him his textbooks.

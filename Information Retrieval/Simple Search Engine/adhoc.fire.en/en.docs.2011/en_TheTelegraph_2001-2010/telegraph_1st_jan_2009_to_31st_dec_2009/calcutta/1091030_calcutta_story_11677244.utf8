The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Eden, catch a sneak peek
                                                                                                               Eden, catch a sneak peek
                                          
	Pay-loaders at work amidst rubble of bricks and concrete where there used to be galleries. Workers with hammers on the prowl. A black skeleton where the giant scoreboard was.        
	Eden Gardens, 145 years young, is in makeover mode. For the four matches it will host during World Cup 2011. On the eve of a 13-member ICC panels visit to inspect the ground and its facilities, Metro takes stock of Eden, a work in progress.        
	Spectator comfort        
	The bill for the reconstruction of Eden is Rs 80 crore (approximately) with spectator comfort enjoying top billing.        
	All those concrete galleries that have skinned the knees of generations of fans will be pulled down and replaced with bucket seats. That will improve comfort, but reduce capacity  by around 10,000.        
	We will construct a second tier in the J Block to make the capacity 90,000 again after the World Cup. But spectator comfort is our top priority, said Bishwarup Dey, the joint secretary of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB).        
	Lack of leg space and the incline were the prime problems with the concrete seats, he conceded.        
	To add to the seating comfort in the all-new blue and gold galleries, ramps between the rows and the entry and exit points are being planned scientifically. Modern and clean toilets, sorely lacking at Indias favourite cricket ground, are being promised.        
	Add-ons        
	Coming up, two giant TV screens, new floodlight towers, a museum, a multi-gym, a dormitory for district players, modern dressing rooms and food courts. The VIP boxes will be given a snazzy look.        
	The drainage pipes will also be relaid. An alternative route for draining out the water is being worked out with the civic authorities, said P.R. Das, the engineering consultant of CAB.                  
	Gallery makers        
	The tender for the makeover has been won by an Ahmedabad firm called VMS Engineering and Design, which works in collaboration with the US-based Burt Hill Design Private Limited. Work on the galleries should be done by the end of 2010, VMS director Hiten Shah told Metro from Ahmedabad.        
	VMS has Sardar Patel Stadium in Motera, Ahmedabad, in its portfolio.        
	No Mexican wave        
	Todays pain is tomorrows gain, say the men at work, and so Eden will be cut to half its capacity for the India-Sri Lanka ODI on December 24.        
	The lower tiers of blocks B and C to the right side of the Club House and blocks K and L to its left are being demolished. The upper tiers too will go. We are afraid capacity will be reduced to half for the Sri Lanka match, said Dey.        
	With yawning gaps on either side of the Club House, spectators and TV watchers will miss the Mexican wave.        
	Fans will also have to do without the giant scoreboard, which is in the process of being converted to a giant screen.        
	Final over        
	Overall, the renovated stadium will look superb. And we are, of course, keeping the basic structure intact for no one wants Eden Gardens to lose its traditional charm, said Dey.                          RITH BASU

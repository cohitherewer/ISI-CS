The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Clash over route share
                                                                                                               Clash over route share
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A clash broke out on Thursday morning on Beleghata Main Road between the drivers and conductors of a private bus on route 239 and a bus of the surface transport corporation on the Shalimar Station-New-Town route, disrupting traffic for over 40 minutes.         
	The fight escalated after some auto-drivers on the Beleghata-Khalpar route joined in. Police were forced to divert rush hour traffic around 10.30am. The matter was resolved after cops intervened.        
	The conductor and driver of the bus on route 239 alleged that the state bus was eating into their passenger share. We met both groups in the evening and it was decided that they would sort out the problem among themselves. Police will take action if a bus is found plying without a valid permit, said an officer of the Beleghata Traffic Guard.         
	Auto drivers also alleged that the surface transport bus was affecting their business.

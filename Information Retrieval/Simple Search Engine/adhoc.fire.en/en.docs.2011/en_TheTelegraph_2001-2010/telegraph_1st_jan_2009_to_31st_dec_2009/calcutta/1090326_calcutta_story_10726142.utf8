The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tale of icons amp; ignorance
                                                                                                                   Tale of icons amp; ignorance
										                              Child actress Bhumisuta Das as Diya in the play Swapna Swades			               
	Everyone is under the scanner  Mahatma Gandhi, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Mangal Pandey, Kshudiram Bose, the Rani of Jhansi. To teenybopper Diya, the whole effort of the freedom struggle, satyagraha, the loss of lives were all meaningless and misguided.        
	You were a fool! Instead of thinking of your career, you gave up your life? What made you do it, I wonder, was it peer pressure or flattery? she asks Kshudiram. And the boy martyr asks her what she would have done if her mother had been attacked and brutalised. There was nothing else to do. You, too, would have acted as I have, he says.        
	Diyas initiation to the patriotic fervour of the Independence movement and its relevance today was the subject of Swapna Swades, a play presented on March 1 by theatre group Naksha at Sisir Mancha.         
	Written and directed by Ashish Das, the play, like most other plays of Naksha, is eminently child-friendly. It takes the point of view of the child. Diya (played by Bhumisuta Das) is like most 13-year olds, precocious and confused. She loves to sing and dance and hopes to go abroad for higher studies. But then in a desire to know more, she surfs the Net and confronts the national icons one after another. The play, complete with light and sound effect, is entertaining in spite of the declamatory dialogue.         
	The same was true of Nakshas other play, Mahanagar, also presented at the same venue. Here Bhumisuta (who has been acting since she was two) plays Ratan, a young village boy determined to seek out his sister Chapala from the labyrinths of the city.         
	The play has a lot of physical acting. Martial arts is used in the choreography to depict the fight between good and evil. A juggler, a man on stilts, a seller of masks and acrobats all form part of the show. Mahanagar also has two primary school children, Alimpon and Abhudoy Dey, played their roles with aplomb.        
	Exclaimed 10-year-old Eshika Das: I loved both plays. I wish I could act too! That shouldnt be difficult, as the 28-year-old group, based in Gobardanga, works with schools throughout the year in the Calcutta suburbs to popularise theatre among children.         
	Some 50-60 children turn up at our rehearsal room each evening (22 km from the Petrapol border), to watch us, so we never run out of young actors and actresses. There are numerous poor refugees and children who live on the streets or the railway platform. Working with them is a learning experience. We also hold workshops in schools, including institutions for the deaf and dumb, said Das.         
	The groups ongoing production is Ankhipadma, about two girls who swear eternal friendship only to realise that they have to spend their lives on different sides of the border.

	Tips for media studies                  A section of the audience at the NSHM seminar      
	NSHM Institute of Media and Communication organised a two-day seminar for teachers on the challenges of teaching media studies and communication courses in a changing global scenario in February, in association with American Center. The subject of debate was the need for an industry-oriented approach.         
	Said Cecil Antony, the chief mentor of NSHM: We have to adapt our teaching models keeping in mind the changing nature of communication today. Teachers should update themselves so that they are equipped to face students.         
	His thoughts were echoed by Mrinal Chatterjee, the head of Indian Institute of Mass Communication, Dhenkanal.         
	After graduating, if a student finds himself not fitting into the industry, he is quick to blame the course. A media studies teacher should retain the skill to write a 500-word news story in half an hour, if he wants to teach his students to do the same. Media is simultaneously global and ultra local. Our teaching has to cater to both needs. Teachers should have hands-on experience and be familiar with technology, he said.

	CHIT CHAT  Career in real estate          
	Builders association Credai Bengal organised a lecture session for students interested in taking up real estate as a career, at Science City on March 7, as part of its four-day Realty Expo 2009.

	Said Santanu Sarkar, a St Xaviers College student who has done a six-month course in real estate management: I received valuable insight into the current state of the market here.

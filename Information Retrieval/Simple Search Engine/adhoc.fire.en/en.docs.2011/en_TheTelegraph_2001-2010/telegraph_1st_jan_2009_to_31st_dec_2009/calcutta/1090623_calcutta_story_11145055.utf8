The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Victoria list plea in court
                                                                                                               Victoria list plea in court
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Environment activist Subhash Dutta moved the high court on Monday seeking an order directing the Victoria Memorial authorities to submit an inventory of objects in the museums collection.        
	The activist, who had initiated the case relating to air pollution near Victoria Memorial in 2002, pointed out that since May 2, 2003, the Memorial authorities had submitted four conflicting affidavits on the number of articles in the museum.        
	He said the petition might be heard on Thursday.        
	Dutta also requested the court to demand a report from the Memorial authorities stating whether the fairy atop the monument was rotating.        
	If the fairy was found to be rotating, the court should ask the authorities to stop the discharge of rust, oil, grease and other chemicals from its base as these might harm the monuments surface, Dutta said.

	A fire raged for nearly eight hours on Friday at the basement of a six-storeyed commercial building on Strand Road, near the flyover leading to Howrah bridge.         
	No one was injured in the blaze that was brought under control but could not be put out till night. Firemen said it probably started around 6.30am from a short-circuit in a plastic godown at the basement.        
	Howrah-bound traffic was diverted from Strand Road for over 14 hours as a result of the fire.         
	Apart from the godown, Model House on 40 Strand Road has over 500 shops, a UCO Bank branch and an office of the income tax department. According to firemen, there were no precautionary arrangements.        
	Twenty-five fire tenders had to be used to bring the fire under control around 3.30pm. Smoke continued to belch out of the building till late in the evening.We have been fighting the flames for over 14 hours now. Though the fire has been under control since 3.30pm, we have been unable to douse it completely, said a senior officer of the fire services department.        
	The task is enormous. The basement is spread over 40,000sq ft and is filled with highly inflammable objects like PVC pipes and fibreglass and polythene items with no fire safety arrangements at all, he added.        
	Around 6.30pm, the top brass of Calcutta police requested the armys assistance for assessing the situation, taking stock and offering technical expertise.        
	The two officers present at the spot are playing an advisory role. They are taking stock of the situation and sharing expertise, Eastern Command spokesperson, Group Captain R.K. Das, told Metro in the evening.        
	Commuters headed to Howrah station were the worst hit in the traffic disruption as a result of the fire.        
	I have been stranded in this hopeless traffic jam for over two hours. Ive covered a distance of 500 metres or less in 90 minutes. I cant walk in this heat or else I wouldve actually tried, said Darayus Engineer, an engineer who was to take the Rajdhani.        
	Fire services department sources said the basement has suffered serious damage and the building must be shut down for repairs for some time.        
	There has been extensive property damage, to the tune of several lakhs. The building authorities are solely responsible, said a fire services department source.        
	Police are preparing a list of the stakeholders in the godown.        
	We have started an investigation. We will start looking for the owners of the godown and other stakeholders as soon as we have identified them, said an officer of Burrabazar police station.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Coolest day but winter weeks away
                                                                                                               Coolest day but winter weeks away

	The nip in the air on Friday morning signalled the coolest October 23 this decade, with the mercury slipping to a minimum of 20.2 degrees Celsius, three notches below normal.        
	But this is by no means the onset of winter, the weatherman hastened to add.        
	While temperatures have been lower than usual over the past couple of days, winter is still far away. Officially, winter commences in Calcutta from early December, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	The weather has been pleasant since monsoon withdrew from the state on Tuesday and Friday morning was quite cool.        
	Like many other weather anomalies this year, even this exceptionally cool October day in Calcutta can be attributed to the maverick monsoon, said O.P. Sharma, the chief meteorologist of a private agency in Delhi.        
	The monsoon withdrew nearly a fortnight later than usual from Bengal, by which time the solar inclination had changed in the northern hemisphere. Cool, dry northwesterlies are also blowing in over Bengal to give that wintry feel, explained Sharma.        
	The minimum temperatures are 3 to 5 degrees Celsius below normal over most parts of eastern India now.        
	Fridays maximum temperature was a couple of degrees above normal at 32.8 degrees Celsius, but the low minimum humidity of 34 per cent meant that the discomfort index was at the normal level of 55 degrees Celsius. So, in meteorological terms, Calcuttans felt no discomfort for most of the day.        
	Both temperature and humidity have climbed down in the last couple of days. The weathers cool and relatively dry. As a result, the comfort level has gone up significantly, said Debnath.        
	This is likely to persist for a while, but in no way does it guarantee a cooler November. The weather over the next few days should be similar, but the situation might not persist. In fact, conditions might become warmer around middle of next week, warned Debnath.

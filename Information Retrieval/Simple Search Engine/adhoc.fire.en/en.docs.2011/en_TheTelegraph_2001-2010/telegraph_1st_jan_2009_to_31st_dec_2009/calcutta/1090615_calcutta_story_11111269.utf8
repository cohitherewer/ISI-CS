	A trip to their favourite weekend getaway turned tragic for three childhood friends when two of them were washed away while bathing in the sea on Saturday afternoon.        
	Medical representatives Arpan Kundu, 26, and Samrat Chatterjee, 25, were taking a dip just an hour after reaching Bakkhali, a four-hour journey from the city, when a strong wave dragged them into the deep.        
	The third friend, 26-year-old MBA student Sudipta Das, managed to swim back to shore because he hadnt gone as far as them.        
	Sudipta knows how to swim while Arpan and Samrat didnt. But that was probably not what saved his life. Sudipta has poor eyesight and wears thick glasses, which stopped him from venturing beyond thigh-deep water, police quoted a family member as saying.        
	The two bodies were found nine hours apart at different places on Sunday.         
	Sudipta, who is under medical observation for trauma at Diamond Harbour Sub-divisional Hospital, told the police that he had collapsed after swimming back to shore. Nobody else saw Arpan and Samrat being washed away.        
	Some visitors saw Sudipta lying on the beach and rushed to help. When he regained consciousness, he broke down and said that a wave had taken away Arpan and Samrat, said a police officer at Diamond Harbour.        
	The three friends  all of them residents of Baruipur, in South 24-Parganas  would often travel to Bakkhali to spend the weekend.        
	This was their sixth or seventh trip there. Who could have thought it would be their last? Our family is shattered, said Samrats cousin Kaushik Mukherjee.        
	The trio had left for Namkhana Ghat by train from Baruipur at 5.10am on Saturday, crossed the river by boat and boarded a bus to Bakkhali.        
	They reached the seaside getaway, which has a row of hotels and a government tourist lodge, around 11.30am. The three friends checked into a hotel and headed for the beach by 12.30pm.        
	The tragedy occurred a few minutes later.        
	Samrats body was caught in a fishing net around 2.30am on Sunday. Arpans body was washed ashore around 11.30am.

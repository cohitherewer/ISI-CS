The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Parents faint in romance case
                                                                                                               Parents faint in romance case
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The parents of a 17-year-old girl passed out in the high court on Thursday when she appeared with their former driver, accused of abducting her, and said she was pregnant.        
	The girls father, a state government official in Malda, had lodged a police complaint against Bijoy Singh, 21. The driver moved the high court after a Malda court rejected his anticipatory bail prayer.        
	The division bench of Justice A.K. Talukdar and Justice R. Roy had asked the police to produce Singh in court. During the hearing on Thursday, he was accompanied by the girl, who appeared for Madhyamik this year. She told the judges that she was six months pregnant and wanted to live with him.        
	Hearing her submission, her parents started sobbing and then fainted. As a medical unit hurried into the courtroom for their treatment, the young couple, apprehending arrest, tried to flee. Cops stopped them in the corridor.        
	The bench later rejected Singhs anticipatory bail plea and sent the girl to a home. Bijoy is now in our custody, said a police officer.        
	Senior advocate S.K. Rakshit said: Since the girl is a minor, the court cannot say her marriage is valid. But as she is pregnant, the court has no option other than to keep her in a home till she turns 18.

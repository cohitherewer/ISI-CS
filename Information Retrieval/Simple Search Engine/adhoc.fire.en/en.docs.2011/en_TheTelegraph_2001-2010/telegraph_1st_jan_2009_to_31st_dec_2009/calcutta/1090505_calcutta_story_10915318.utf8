  Caring hubby gets back car via court				       OUR LEGAL REPORTER                                                
	Calcutta High Court has stood by a trader who dared to stand up to the bully-boy tactics of the Election Commission after his new SUV was forcibly requisitioned last month.        
	The single-judge bench of Justice Sanjib Banerjee ordered the sub-divisional officer (SDO) of Canning on Monday to immediately return Sachin Haldars Tata Safari and compensate him for the period the vehicle remained in official custody.        
	The Representation of the People Act, 1951, empowers the Election Commission to requisition public and commercial vehicles for poll purposes. But requisitioning vehicles meant for personal use is contrary to the provisions of the said act, the judge said.        
	Haldar, who owns a sari shop in Canning, had bought the mint-green Tata Safari a month ago mainly to ferry his wife to and from the clinic where she has been undergoing treatment.         
	My client hadnt even received his registration papers from the transport office when the district magistrate of South 24-Parganas issued a memo (No. 3117) informing him that the car had been requisitioned for transportation of voting machines to and from polling stations. The officer ordered him to hand over the car to the election office on May 10, lawyer Dipankar Basu told the court.        
	The 51-year-old trader immediately wrote to the magistrate, saying his wife required regular medical attention and that he had purchased the car for her comfort. The administration not only turned down my clients request but also seized the vehicle well in advance of the date mentioned earlier, Basu said.        
	The Tata Safari was taken to the office of the SDO, Md Shaid, on April 23 and has been parked there since.        
	Haldars lawyer cited a ruling by Justice Girish Chandra Gupta in a similar case to counter the government counsels argument about the SDO being within his rights to requisition any vehicle he deemed fit for poll purposes. That case had come up for hearing in the run-up to the 2006 Assembly poll.        
	The decision of the election officer is not only contrary to the provisions of the Representation of the People Act but also a violation of the Motor Vehicles Act. The owner of any private vehicle has no right to allow others to use it without the prior approval of the motor vehicles department, Basu said.        
	Justice Banerjee ruled that the administration must pay the petitioner rent in accordance with government rates from April 23 onwards.        
	The court also ordered all election officers to ensure that no private vehicle meant for personal use is requisitioned.        
	The ruling could open the floodgates for petitions from other car owners who have had to part with their vehicles against their wishes this election.        
	Advocate Subroto Mookherjee said the Election Commission would surely be careful in its interpretation of the Representation of the People Act from now on.        
	Courts generally do not meddle in the election process, especially when the polling dates are so close. But Haldars case was a strong one because it also involved the Motor Vehicles Act. The fact that there was a previous order against the commission in a similar case made the decision easier, he added.        
	The Election Commission has been playing bully boy this election, whether bowing to political might and thrusting a loophole-ridden graffiti-with-permission rule on house owners or barging into National Library despite repeated requests by readers and scholars.

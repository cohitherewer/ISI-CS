The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Chaos corridor toll on cop and commoner
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Chaos corridor toll on cop and commoner
          MEGHDEEP BHATTACHARYYA                          Cops man traffic in Metro channel on Tuesday. (Pradip Sanyal)                                  
	An indefinite Trinamul Congress dharna in the Metro channel disrupted traffic at the city centre for the second consecutive day on Tuesday.         
	Police have not permitted the party to continue the agitation beyond a day but hundreds of its supporters returned to the 70m stretch around Tuesday noon and started a sit-in that threw traffic haywire for at least four hours.         
	The Trinamul demonstration against state-sponsored terror is only the latest traffic-stopper programme in the chaos corridor that is abuzz with disruptive activities at least 250 days a year.         
	At the receiving end are not only ordinary citizens but also policemen. Take the case of Rajesh Basak (name changed), a constable posted in the Hare Street police station outpost in the Metro channel.        
	The sole breadwinner in a family of five, the 32-year-old has been manning the protest platform for eight months now.        
	I have aged five years in the eight months. It may not look much but managing the area for six to seven hours a day is very stressful, said the Kestopur resident as scores of Trinamul activists carried out their disruption agenda.         
	Taking it easy is not an option as Metro channel is a shout away from Raj Bhavan and other high-security installations, he added.        
	Numerous VIPs, including Buddhadeb Bhattcharjee and Mamata Banerjee, attend meetings here. Should anything ever go wrong, the ramifications could be dire.        
	The worst days in his stint  the Trinamuls July 21 martyrs day programme and the CPMs commemoration of the food movement on August 31.        
	Basak feels for the thousands who have suffered the disruptions like him. I do my best to help when I see ambulances caught in snarls. But theres so little I can do, he said. The powers that be could easily avoid the mess. But they are only concerned about political gains.

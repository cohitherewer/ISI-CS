  - Doc spots amp; saves kid crawling under vehicles          A STAFF REPORTER                          Five-year-old Arshprit Kaur in hospital on Monday with a head injury and a deep cut in her left eye.   Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                              
	A five-year-old kindergarten kid fell off a speeding school bus on Vidyasagar Setu on Monday morning but the careless driver pressed ahead, leaving the critically injured girl crawling under passing vehicles till a doctor spotted and rescued her.        
	Arshprit Kaur, a student of Shri Shikshayatan on Lord Sinha Road, was sitting to the left of driver Chitto Das when the latch of the vehicles cabin door gave away and she fell through it on the metalled road a little distance from the toll plaza.         
	The little girl might have been crushed under the wheels of passing vehicles had Navin Das, who was driving his daughter to school, not noticed something crawling in the middle of the road and stopped to see what it was.         
	 I first saw the bus shifting to the right lane with a jerk and then my eyes fell on her, though I didnt know then that it was a child crawling under the passing vehicles. I immediately stopped the car and rushed towards her. She was bleeding from the head, and her left eye was swollen and completely black, Das, the chief physiotherapist at Park Clinic, told Metro.        
	The bus had moved at least 300 metres ahead by the time the driver and his helper realised that the emergency door was ajar and Arshprit had fallen off.         
	Das said he saw the helper get off the school bus before it sped away with the other students. The helper ran towards where I was standing and the two of us carried the child to my car so that we could take her to the nearest hospital, he recalled.        
	Another passer-by contacted Arshprits father Inderjit Singh Sekhon, who is in the transport business, by dialling the number on the childs identity card.        
	Das took Arshprit to SSKM Hospital, from where she was shifted to Calcutta Medical Research Institute.         
	A CT scan revealed that the girl had suffered a brain injury along with a cut in her left eye and bruises on the left side of her body. A doctor at the hospital said in the evening that her condition was serious but stable.         
	Arshprits father said the driver of the school bus not only left his daughter to die but also lied about the incident.         
	I had called up the driver immediately after receiving information from a stranger about what had happened. But he told me that our daughter was in school and that nothing like that had happened. I still went to SSKM because I instinctively knew that the driver was lying.        
	This is not the first time that a bus ferrying schoolchildren has been involved in an accident. Pool cars are even more unsafe, and most of them operate without permits.        
	Shri Shikshayatan washed its hands of Mondays incident, saying that it had no say in parents sending their wards to school by bus or pool car.         
	It is the parents responsibility to ensure that the vehicles in which they send their children to school are safe. I spoke to some parents again about this after what happened to Arshprit, rector Indrani Ganguly said.        
	The owner of Priyanka Travels, which runs the bus in which Arshprit was going to school from her south Howrah residence, admitted that the driver and his helper should not have made the girl sit next to a door with a defective latch.         
	It was unfortunate that the girl had to suffer because of their negligence, said Rabin Patra, who owns four buses that ferry students of Shri Shikshayatan to and from school.         
	A complaint was lodged at the SSKM Hospital police outpost.        
	Police said they were investigating the incident, which occurred around 8am, but driver Das hadnt been arrested till late in the night.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cool comfort at power cut cost 
                                                                                                               Cool comfort at power cut cost 
          ZEESHAN JAWED                          The hottest April in six decades has prompted a spurt in demand for air-conditioners. A Telegraph picture                                   
	A spurt in the sale of air-conditioners over the past one-and-a-half-month has resulted in a 6-7 per cent rise in the desmand for power, widening the gap with the supply.        
	The heat wave seems to have helped the air-conditioner industry beat the downturn, with insiders reporting a 100 per cent rise in the sale of the gadget compared with April 2008.        
	CESC figures reveal that the average summer demand during evening peak hours varies between 1,500 and 1,600MW and during the day peak hours, between 1,300 and 1,400MW. But thanks to the rise in the sale of air-conditioners, the demand has shot up by 6-7 per cent. We are struggling to meet the demand, said a CESC official.        
	The demand-supply mismatch can also be attributed to snags in various power generating units of CESC. On April 19, a blast in a transformer in Liluah had resulted in wild fluctuations in the flow of electricity, causing the units supplying power to the city to trip.        
	Since then various parts of the city have been suffering power cuts for two-three hours daily.        
	A one-tonne air-conditioner consumes between 1KW and 1.2KW of power an hour and the assembled ones guzzle between 1.5KW and 2KW each.        
	At whatever temperature we set an air-conditioner, the power consumption will rise if the outdoor temperature increases, said Shantanu Chatterjee, the executive director of CESC.        
	Explaining how the utility is struggling to meet the increasing need for power, the official said: If the demand rises by 40-50 MW in a month or two, we have to install additional transformers and lay new cables or upgrade existing ones to ensure steady supply.        
	If the feedback from dealers is any indication, the sustained summer assault is not allowing the downturn to make a dent in the demand for air-conditioners. Compared with April 2008, we have clocked a 100 per cent growth in the sale of air-conditioners, said Jiten Chawla of Cams Corner, a chain of consumer durables outlets.        
	Many potential buyers are being made to wait for two to three days before they are being delivered the product. If you want to buy an air-conditioner, leave your address and contact number with us. We will approach you in a couple of days when supplies reach us, said a salesman of Temp Air, an outlet of consumer durables on Ballygunge Station Road.        
	Those who own ACs and want to get them serviced may also have to queue up. The phone calls we have been getting over the past fortnight asking for servicing are driving us crazy, said a technician of Temp Air.

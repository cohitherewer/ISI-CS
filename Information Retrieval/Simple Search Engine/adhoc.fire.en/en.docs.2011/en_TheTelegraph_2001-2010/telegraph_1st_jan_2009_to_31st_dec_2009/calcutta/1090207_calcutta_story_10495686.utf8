	Young entrepreneurs let loose their imagination to come out with the most viable business plan at the second Merrill Lynch I Create National Youth Business Plan Competition held at the Science City auditorium on January 29.         
	From giving out two-wheelers on rent, selling your own brand of brain tonic or environment-friendly bins, e-retailing of garments to making home furnishing using papier mach, there were no dearth of innovative ideas doing the rounds.         
	Twelve students from various schools and colleges in West Bengal, Rajasthan, Karnataka and Gujarat participated in the event.        
	The competition was the culmination of 40-class curriculum entrepreneurship educational programmes, started in June 2007, in the four regional centres of I Create. This is a three-year entrepreneurship ed- ucational programme, which has a target of reaching out to 3,000 students, said Sreoshi Moitra, the director of I Create in West Bengal.         
	Each presentation saw meticulous detailing of the product, including its business viability, logo, capital to be invested, ways to procure the capital through loans and how to break even. Present on the occasion were Siddhartha Dutta, the pro vice-chancellor of Jadavpur University, and G.D. Gautama, the principal secretary of the department of micro, small-scale enterprises and textiles of the government of West Bengal.         
	Saptarshi Pal of Jadavpur University won the first prize with his point of purchase display (POP)  a display of products in a shop designed to attract customers  for FMCG products.         
	I had been to Japan as part of an exchange programme. I found POP in vogue there. Thus the idea struck me, said Pal.        
	Thomas Albert from Vadodara was the first runner-up with his plan to rent out two-wheelers. Aakanksha Upadhyaya of Jaipur and Rahul G.H. of Bangalore were the joint second runners-up. The former proposed her brand of brain tonic, while the latter proposed recharge coupons for flute vendors.         
	In our country, students tend be job-seekers rather than providers. Through this programme, we want to encourage them to start their own business, said Harsh Bhargava, the honorary president of I Create Inc. USA, an NGO dedicated to entrepreneurship development through training, mentoring and counselling.         
	The candidates were judged on four parameters,  creativity, practicality, presentation and viability of the project, he explained.         
	The winner will visit New York for the National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship International Award ceremony. He will be given a prize of $500 there, to start his business. The first runner-up got Rs 5,000 while the second runners-up got Rs 3,000 each.

                                                                                                               Boys body found in bag by the river
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The bag in which the body was found. (Gopal Senapati)                                  
	The body of a two-year-old boy, believed to have been murdered, was found in a travel bag barely 200m from Sankrail police station, by the Hooghly, on Monday morning.        
	Till late on Monday the identity of the boy remained a mystery.        
	Residents of Sankrails Champatala, who first spied a tiny leg sticking out of the black bag, said the boy was wearing a maroon shirt and black shorts. There were socks on both his feet but one shoe was missing. The other shoe and a feeding bottle were later found in the bag.        
	A preliminary probe suggests the boy was killed. We are waiting for the post-mortem report, said an officer of Sankrail police station.        
	There were deep injury marks on the back of the boys head and behind the right ear. The nature of the injuries suggest he had been hit with a blunt object, he added.        
	The cops suspect the boy had been killed somewhere else and the body, stuffed in the bag, was thrown into the river.        
	The spot where the bag was found gets flooded during high tide. The bag must have surfaced after the water receded, said an officer working on the case.        
	Photographs of the boy have been sent to all police stations in Howrah and also to the ones across the river, including Kidderpore and Metiabruz. We have asked the police stations to pass on information about any missing child aged around two years, the officer added.        
	The sleuths are scanning the bag and the clothes for marks or labels that could lead them to the boys family.        
	The bag was spotted around 6.30am by Subhodip Sarkar, a resident of Sankrail, during his morning walk by the river. Seeing the tiny leg jutting out I thought the bag contained some kind of a toy. Instead of opening it myself, I decided to call some others, said Sarkar.        
	The bag was finally opened by another resident, identified as Asgar Ali Mondal. Seeing a babys body inside, the witnesses alerted the police.        
	This comes four weeks after Yash Lakhotia, a seven-year-old boy, was kidnapped from Howrah and found murdered in a bush along Foreshore Road, 2km from his Shibpur home.        
	The alleged mastermind, identified as Santosh Singh, is yet to be arrested.        
	Officers recalled another incident on June 27, 2008, when the body of a 12-year-old girl, stuffed in a bag used for carrying goods, was found on Telkalghat Road in Howrah town.

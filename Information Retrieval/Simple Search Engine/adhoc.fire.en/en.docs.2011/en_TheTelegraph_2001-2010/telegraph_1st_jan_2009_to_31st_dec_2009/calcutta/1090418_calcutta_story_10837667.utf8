                                                                                                               Kidnap cry in court
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Friday appointed a special officer to report on the whereabouts of a 28-year-old lawyer whose father has alleged that she has been abducted by one of her colleagues.        
	The bench of Justice K.J. Sengupta and Justice T.K. Mukherjee asked the special officer to file his report within 10 days.        
	T.K. Burman, an officer of Calcutta police, has lodged a complaint stating that his daughter Tina was abducted by Samit Mondal, 34, and her father Bhaktipada more than a month ago. Tina and Samit are enrolled with the high court.        
	Bhaktipadas lawyer Arun Maity, however, said Tina had married Samit and the couple had been living in their rented house in Behala. In response to Burmans habeas corpus petition, the bench asked Bhaktipadas lawyer to produce Tina. But the lawyer said Tina could not be brought as she was pregnant. The bench then appointed the special officer to report on Tinas whereabouts.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | In-laws held for wife death 
                                                                                                               In-laws held for wife death 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The husband and in-laws of a 32-year-old homemaker were arrested on Thursday afternoon after she was found hanging from a ceiling fan in her Rifle Range Road flat.        
	Duraksha Akhter Ahmeds parents lodged a complaint with police accusing her in-laws of torturing and killing her.        
	An emotional note from Duraksha asking her parents to take care of her one-year-old daughter Zoha was found near the body, said police.        
	The homemakers 36-year-old husband Mushtaq Ahmed, a homoeopath, father-in-law Mansoor Ahmed and mother-in-law Taiba Ahmed were held on the charge of abetting her suicide.         
	Mushtaq built a dispensary on Raghunandan Saha Road, near his house, with Rs 8 lakh he extracted from Durakshas parents. The family shifted from their rented accommodation on Shamsul Huda Road to the first-floor flat in the Rifle Range Road building four years ago after Duraksha arranged for the money, said Abu Barkat, her cousin.        
	According to Durakshas family members, her in-laws often made her starve and beat her up.        
	She had complained to me that her mother-in-law never gave her adequate food after she gave birth to a girl. Durakshas in-laws did not take care of her even when she was pregnant. She had lost 12kg since childbirth and often used to faint, said Zarin Akhtar, her elder sister.        
	We had tried to convince Duraksha to file for divorce but she used to fear social stigma and Mushtaq blackmailed her. My sister was looking for a separation from her husband after the birth of their child but she died before that, added Zarin.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | City dons poll armour
                                                                                                               City dons poll armour
  - Cops on overdrive to make up for shortage of central forces          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	If you have been fretting over too many police barricades on the city roads lately, brace for more security checks in the days to come.        
	Lalbazar is summoning all the resources at its disposal to make up for the shortage of paramilitary personnel this election and turn the usually freewheeling city into a fortress before polling day.        
	The strength of paramilitary forces in the city for the May 13 poll will be almost 19 companies less than the deployment in 2006. But the police bosses promise that their absence wont be felt.         
	All 788 premises where booths will be set up  2,635 of them  have been declared either sensitive or super sensitive. Fifty companies of paramilitary forces will form the inner security ring at the booths while the police will make up the outer circle.        
	Apart from our manpower within the city, we have requisitioned 15,000 more police personnel to ensure that polling is free, fair and untouched by violence, an officer said.        
	Around 160 police booths will be set up across the city. Forty vans of the radio flying squad and 10 from the heavy radio flying squad will patrol the city along with mobile teams from 48 police stations. River traffic will be in action from 5.30am till 9pm from Ahiritala to Budge Budge.        
	According to police officers, the last 48 hours leading to the start of polling would be crucial.        
	We will know where we stand after campaigning ends on May 11. If clashes occur on either flanks of the North and South 24-Parganas in the last lap, we could be in for a flare-up in the city, too, warned an officer.         
	So, are the police taking any special steps to ensure that the city remains immune to outside influence?        
	We are monitoring all traffic to and from the city. We have also asked for lists of guests in hotels and lodges. If we find anyone who does not have a valid reason to be in the city, appropriate action will be taken, the officer said.        
	On polling day, no civilian other than an official will be allowed within 200 metres of a booth if he/she is not a resident of that area. We might even arrest violators of this rule, an officer said.        
	Central forces are scheduled to begin area-domination  the exercise of formally taking over an areas security with a flag-march or a patrol drill  from May 9. Police teams will take up position in booths a day before polling.         
	Liquor shops will remain closed from 5pm on May 11 till May 13. The outlets will close again on May 16, the day of counting votes.

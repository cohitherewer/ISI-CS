The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mob on the rampage at station
                                                                                                               Mob on the rampage at station
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A mob ransacked booking counters and pelted stones at trains after a ticket checker allegedly misbehaved with a woman passenger travelling without a ticket on Monday afternoon.         
	Suburban trains from Sealdah Main station were disrupted for more than an hour in two phases because of blockades by passengers.        
	The trouble started around 3pm, when 50-year-old Asima Biswas, who arrived by a local train from Ranaghat, was stopped at the gate by ticket checker Malati Biswas.         
	When the ticket checker asked the passenger to pay a fine, she accused her of misbehaviour to attract the sympathy of people, alleged an Eastern Railway official.        
	The ticket checker took me to a room and manhandled me when I refused to pay a bribe, said Asima Biswas.        
	Witnesses also said ticket checkers tried to extract money from the passenger.        
	The passengers who jumped to Asima Biswass defence later broke glass panes of counters and threw stones at trains stationed at the platform. Some of the drivers were also injured by the mob, said an official.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Global banks missing at Joka job mart
                                                                                                               Global banks missing at Joka job mart
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The tremors of the global downturn were felt at the Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta, with the top names of corporate finance staying away from the final placement season.        
	Slot Zero  the first day of placements for the B-schools flagship postgraduate diploma course  is usually dominated by international investment banks. But Slot Zero 2009, conducted on Saturday, was marked by the absence of Wall Street giants.        
	Investment banks from Wall Street, which recruit in large numbers from our institute, have not come this year, said a second-year student.        
	The Joka institute, known for its finance curriculum, would earlier host headhunters from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Lehman Brothers, JP Morgan and Merrill Lynch twice a year  during the summer (for a two-month internship) and final placements.        
	Students would land plum jobs, attractive roles and global postings. Traditionally, investment banks would come for summer placements and then make pre-placement offers. In the past few years, they recruited during final placements too. But with the finance sector in turmoil it is not surprising that they gave our campus a miss this year, said an another student.        
	Last years highest annual offer of Rs 1.36 crore was from Lehman Brothers, which went bust in mid-2008. The Joka campus was also the only IIM from where students joined Morgan Stanleys London office last year.        
	The absence of the Wall Street big names would mean lower pay and fewer finance jobs for the students. The perception that IIM Calcuttas marketing curriculum is not so strong could deal another blow to the placements.        
	The banks have, however, honoured their pre-placemement offers (PPO).         
	A majority of the 60 PPOs this year were from global investment banks.         
	To combat the no-show of the global giants, the B-school has invited smaller banks and finance firms for campus recruitment, which proved a success during the last summer placements.

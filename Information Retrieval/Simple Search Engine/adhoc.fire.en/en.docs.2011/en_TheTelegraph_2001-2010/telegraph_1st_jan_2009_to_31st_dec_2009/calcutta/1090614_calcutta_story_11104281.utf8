										                        An installation by Indrani Nayar-Gall. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)				                           
	Indrani Nayar-Gall is an artist trained at Kala Bhaban of Visva Bharati university. She subsequently married a Black from Barbados and is now a citizen of the US.         
	She was back here recently on an invitation from Khoj and Emami Chisel and she spent some time here creating art works that were subsequently exhibited at Emami Towers last week.         
	The lady with a double-barrel name has produced works of a pedestrian nature that could well have been the handiwork of any local artist.         
	Red and yellow strings were the leitmotif, so to speak, of her works  paper lanterns with strings hanging from them, panels with red strings. There were besides, a mobile of paper parrots going round and round like a fan, lots of tinselly paper, and crimson paper cut out to resemble pop-up lotus flowers (they may look like vulva to some) stuck on blue sheets of paper. All the shiny and exotic-looking things a foreigner would associate with incredible India.        
	Sadly, Indrani Nayar-Galls lecture on the ideas behind her work was tortuous and seemingly unending, and hinged on issues such as race, discrimination, genocide and colour that have been done to death but have yet to go out of fashion.         
	The lady seems to be one of those special individuals who do not need a lot to feel traumatised, which she did at the immigration check when she and her family decided to move to America from Barbados at the worst time imaginable  post-9/11. Her works  prints and installations  that she projected were so unremarkable that one wondered on what basis she was chosen for this residency by Khoj and Emami Chisel.         
	She had appropriated John Tenniels Rabbit and that seemed the best part of her graphic work. Not a few dollars gone down the drain.

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	CAT examinees remained in the dark about rescheduled tests and a possible pen-and-paper retest with only four days of the first online IIM entrance examination left.         
	The IIMs and Prometric, which is conducting the test, also could not say on Thursday whether the first online CAT would continue beyond the announced 10-day window.        
	I am not sure what will happen. We will go through the test and at the end of it we will meet and decide what steps to take. A full inquiry into the problems will be conducted, said Shekhar Chaudhuri, the director of IIM Calcutta.        
	Prometric had initially said cancelled tests would be rescheduled within December 7, the last day of the exam. An FAQ handed by the testing service provider to the examinees on Thursday states it will try and accommodate all candidates within this years testing period.         
	If there is a need to extend beyond December 7, IIMs will announce this as soon as a decision has been made, reads the answer to the question of whether tests could be held after the 10-day test window.        
	About 175 of the 10,000-odd examinees from Calcutta had their tests cancelled on the first two days of the test window period.         
	For most of the candidates waiting for a word from the authorities well past the 48-hour deadline, the test has lost credibility. The toll-free number provided by Prometric went unanswered, said many.         
	I am under constant pressure. What if they dont give me much notice? All I can think of is whether my computer will hang again or not. The new date might clash with my job or other exams. This will affect my performance, said a candidate whose test at the Heritage Institute of Technology was cancelled last Saturday.        
	Many coaching centres have also appealed to the IIMs to cancel the online test. The proposal is reportedly being discussed by the IIM authorities.        
	The decision to conduct the test online was taken to free faculty time and also to address issues of security. We knew there would be some problems but not how large. The problems will definitely be addressed, added the IIM Calcutta director.        
	When is the question that is troubling IIM aspirants.

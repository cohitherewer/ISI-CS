          A STAFF REPORTER                                         
	Thousand state buses and Metro trains till early morning along with the usual quota of private buses, trams and taxis will ferry pandal hoppers this Puja.        
	The transport plan for Puja was discussed by finance minister Asim Dasgupta, transport minister Ranjit Kundu, transport secretary Sumanta Chowdhury and Calcutta Tram Company chairman Rajdeo Goala at a meeting in Writers Buildings on Sunday.        
	There is an influx of people into the city during Puja. Todays meeting was held to discuss ways to increase the comfort of commuters. The transport department has decided to run 1,000 buses and trams during Puja to ensure that people can move easily within the city, Kundu said after the meeting.        
	The minister and other transport officials, however, refused to say how many state buses ply in the city usually.        
	Goala said 130 trams would ply during the festive days. We have been requesting our employees not to go on leave during Puja, he added.        
	The officials reiterated their commitment to introducing 50 buses, partially funded under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, before Puja.        
	Dasgupta said: Of the 1,300 high-quality buses to be introduced under the scheme, at least 50 would be introduced before Puja. Our target is 60, though. The rest will be introduced by December.        
	Forty of the new buses will be run by the Calcutta State Transport Corporation and the South Bengal State Transport Corporation and the remaining by franchises.        
	According to the private operators, around 7,500 to 8,000 private buses and 1,500 minibuses  the usual weekday numbers  would run during Puja. Taxi associations said there would be 32,000 to 35,000 cabs, again the weekday count, on the road. A quarter of the private buses will run through the night. Taxis too are likely to ply at night.        
	Metro Railway will operate trains according to its Puja schedule for the past few years. On Saptami, trains will ply from 2pm to midnight. On Ashtami and Navami, trains will ply from 2pm to 4am. On Dashami trains will run from 3pm to 9pm.

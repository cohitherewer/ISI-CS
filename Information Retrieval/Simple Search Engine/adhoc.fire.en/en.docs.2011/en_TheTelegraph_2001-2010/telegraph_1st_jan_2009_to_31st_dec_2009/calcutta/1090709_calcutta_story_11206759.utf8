                      Reinterpreting an epic                    Unfolding an action prior to the birth of Dhritarashtra and Pandu as told in the Mahabharata, Sundarams latest production Ja Nei Bharatey interprets the ancient Indian epic in a completely rational, original light. Tracing the crosscurrents of aims and desires that shape time, it asks questions pertaining to the miraculous birth of the Pandavas and Kauravas, as also tries to uncover reasons for Dhritarashtras taking up weapons or rushing into leaping flames. In an attempt to understand and explain all that remains unsaid and unanswered in the epic, the plot manoeuvres incidents without distorting the original in any way. It reflects upon events that led to the great conflict, taking the side of nature, wilderness and the neglected outcasts of society. The play taps the ancient roots of our culture, testing knowledge embedded in the Puranas with our new awareness in an age of globalisation and scientific progress. In this new perspective, stereotypical characters like Shakuni, Pandu, Ambika and Gandhari acquire new dimensions and some new characters step out of the shadows. Drama, direction amp; performance: Manoj Mitra.                  Event: Play in Bengali, Ja Nei Bharatey, produced by Sundaram When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Madhusudan Mancha

	Policemen and forest department officials on Tuesday remained clueless about the whereabouts of the rare monkeys that disappeared from the Alipore zoo on Sunday.         
	On Tuesday morning, senior officers of Calcutta police and officials of the state forest department toured the zoo, but failed to unearth any clues.         
	The visit is a part of the investigation. Fingerprints at the enclosure that housed the stolen monkeys have been washed away in the rain. We could not find any fingerprint. But officers in the detective department will crack the case soon, said the special commissioner of Calcutta police, Banibrata Basu.         
	He was accompanied by officers of the detective department, which is handling the case. The sleuths looked around the cage were the Common Marmosets were kept and questioned some zoo employees.         
	Those manning the entry and exit points of the city have been alerted. If anyone tries to smuggle the monkeys out, he would be caught immediately, said an officer of the detective department.         
	The officers, however, remained silent when asked whether the Marmosets might have already been smuggled out of the city.         
	On behalf of the forest department, the additional chief secretary of forest, K.S. Rajendra Kumar, visited the zoo along with chief wildlife warden S.B. Mondal.        
	Kumar said at Writers Buildings: The security system at the zoo is not at all up to the mark. The new director has been instructed to prepare a detailed list of possible steps to improve the security at the zoo.         
	A police picket will be posted on the zoo premises on Wednesday, said a member of the zoos managing committee. The number of guards will also be increased, especially at night, the member said.         
	According to him, the boundary walls of the zoo will be fortified with barbed wire to prevent people from scaling the walls to enter the zoo.         
	Sources said forest minister Ananta Roy would visit the zoo on Wednesday.         
	An official of the forest department said former zoo director S.K. Chowdhury had been suspended on Monday for administrative failure.         
	However, nothing can be said decisively before the investigation is over, he added.        
	He said those who had stolen the monkeys were familiar with the habits of the tiny mammals.         
	They are difficult to locate since they are so small, the forest department official pointed out.        
	The sluggish pace of the investigation has infuriated wildlife activists.        
	International wildlife theft rackets are flourishing in Calcutta. If the administration isnt proactive in netting the culprits, such incidents will increase, warned wildlife activist Joydip Kundu.

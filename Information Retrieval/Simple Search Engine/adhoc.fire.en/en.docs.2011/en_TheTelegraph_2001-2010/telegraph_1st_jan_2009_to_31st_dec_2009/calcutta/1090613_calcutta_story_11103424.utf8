The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Swelter bigger bother than power supply
                                                                                                               Swelter bigger bother than power supply
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The good news is that the worst of the power cuts seems to be behind us, the bad news is that the same cannot be said of the heat and humidity.        
	The power situation continued its slow limp back towards normality on Friday with the deficit in CESC-served areas hovering around 75MW through the day, causing rotational power cuts of 60 to 90 minutes.        
	If the power utility held out hope of smoother supply over the weekend, the weather office warned of Saturday-Sunday swelter.        
	The thunderclouds weakened before they could cause rain in or around the city. The weekend will be hot and humid, as the normal monsoon flow may not be activated over the next four to five days, said the Met Office.        
	In the absence of thunderstorms or monsoon activity both the temperature and the humidity could rise, adding points to the discomfort index over the weekend, warned the weatherman.        
	Fridays Calcutta was sultry without rainfall for the fifth consecutive day, as the mercury touched a maximum of 36.5 degree Celsius, three points above normal and the minimum humidity was 60 percent (normal range 40-45 percent). The discomfort index read 63 degree Celsius, eight points above normal.        
	The double blow of power cuts and weather woes hit the city early with supply stuttering from 10.40am and continuing in phases of 60-90 minutes.        
	The shortfall was 90MW at noon and 68MW at 7pm,, against 100 MW on Thursday evening.        
	The 250MW first unit of the Budge Budge plant of the CESC that had collapsed earlier this week after a snag in its turbine rotor will be tested with new parts over the weekend. CESC officials confirmed that 10 carbon brush slip rings need to be replaced, four of which would have to be imported from the UK. But they would be sourced locally for the time being.        
	Arrangements have been made to procure the spare parts locally. We will try them out either on Saturday or Sunday night when demand is low. The unit will have to be shut down for four-five hours. If we succeed then we will be able to step up our generation at the unit to a normal level by this weekend. If not, we will have to wait for the imported spare parts which would take about a week, said a CESC official.         
	Once generation of the Budge Budge unit reaches normal levels the situation will improve considerably, claimed the official.

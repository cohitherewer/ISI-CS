The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Help, my daughters hooked on her virtual friends
                                                                                                               Help, my daughters hooked on her virtual friends
  - Parents of teenagers struggle to cope with new-age demands of poke and scrap on social networking sites          CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE      
	Rina, 14, is up way past midnight, not solving math problems, but chatting with Facebook friends. Some who she meets in school every day, others who she has befriended online but never met. I first decided to stop her from using the Net at home but then thought what if she went to a cyber caf, instead. I really dont know how to keep an eye on her online activities, frets her mother, who confesses that she herself is technologically challenged.        
	Rinas mothers fear is typical of the demands of new-age parenting, as social networking sites invade teenaged bedrooms. After SMS smileys, parents are now having to decode poke (attention-seeking nudge on Facebook) and scrap (posting a message on Orkut) in their struggle to monitor their childrens experiments with social networking truths.        
	They might think they are old enough but not all teenagers are ready to be on social networking sites. They are not mature enough and they definitely need to be supervised, said psychologist Moharmala Chatterjee.                  
	Facebook in its privacy policy debars those under the age of 13 and advises parental supervision for minors above 13. MySpace sets 14 as the age bar and Orkut 18. The age bar is often ducked with teenagers creating accounts by merely fudging their date of birth.        
	Mouparna, 14, joined Orkut claiming to be a 19-year-old. Her friend list of Orkutians between 18 and 35 prompted one of her elder cousins also on Orkut to alert Mouparnas mother. She was interacting with strangers twice her age. I banned her from using the Net, says Mouparnas mother.        
	Banning children from being on Orkut or Facebook will make these social networking sites more intriguing and alluring for them, warn psychologists. Shovana, who turned 13 this January, is desperate to open a Facebook account but her mother has denied her permission. Most of my friends and cousins are, why cant I? protests Shovana. She has stopped talking to her mother, who is at her wits end.        
	According to Chatterjee, parents could join the social networking sites, become part of the social loop and then explain to the child the danger of getting up close and personal with a stranger in the virtual world.        
	When Debashree Ganguly found out that her 15-year-old son was on Facebook for hours she had a frank chat with him about the pros and cons. A strict timeline and keeping the computer in the living room has helped mother and son keep the peace at home. Once he is done with his schoolwork, he can be on Facebook but I make sure he wraps up within 30 minutes. You have to be strict but if you explain things to them then they are less rebellious, says Debashree.

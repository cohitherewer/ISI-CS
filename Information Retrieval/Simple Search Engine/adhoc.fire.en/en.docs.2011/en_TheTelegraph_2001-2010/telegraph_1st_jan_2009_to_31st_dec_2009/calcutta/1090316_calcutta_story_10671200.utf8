The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Charge of the green brigade
                                                                                                               Charge of the green brigade
                              Metros campaign to save the Maidan                            
	Emails of protest against the transport ministers attempt to bring the Maidan under his governments control havent stopped since Metro started a campaign to save the precious patch of green. Heres what the people want:                
	Two pictures  Spot the Maidan if you can, Buddhababu (Feb. 21) and Lungs of millions (Feb. 23)  expose opposite characters of the Maidan. The first shows how the air gets polluted, the second how we get fresh air.  
	The Maidan makes up the lungs of the city and needs to be protected. It is best if it remains in the hands of the army. The other parts of the city are infected and need to be treated. But we should not forget that the lungs are the most vital part of our body.        
	Dinabandhu Mukherjee               
	The moot question is  do we really care for health and environment? How long will political chicanery prevail over rule of law and graceful living? It seems we have pawned our conscience to baneful politics.

	Being a senior citizen of 83 years residing in north Calcutta, I vehemently oppose the governments move (to grab the Maidan). At the fag end of my life I cannot forget the afternoons spent on the Maidan, with fresh, clean air blowing and various sports being played. I also cannot forget the early morning tram rides past the Brigade Parade Ground and the Race Course. Though I used to visit the fairs held on the Maidan, I always disliked the sorry state in which the organisers left the greens.         
	Deb Kumar Basu               
	I congratulate Metro for its fight against destruction of Calcutta. Like all right-thinking residents of the city, I support the cause whole-heartedly. Millions like me are suffering from respiratory distress because of the old buses and katatel-run autorickshaws that Subhas Chakraborty allowed on the city roads. Now he wants to grab the Maidan and take away from Calcuttans the only remaining source of clean air. If he gets hold of the Maidan, he will tear it apart like a hungry wolf, holding meetings, jamborees and melas, digging holes for cooking and erecting pandals and turning the area into a slum. And one day some British director will make an award-winning film on it to bring glory to the minister and his government. We just want to breathe clean air.        
	Diptikumar Sen              
	If the Victoria Memorial is heritage, equally so is the Maidan. The health of society is of paramount importance especially given the present state of the health system. The government should never be allowed authority over this piece of heaven. If such is the vision of overlords and politicians of this government duly elected by the people they should be made to step down and give way to the younger generation who are environmentally literate and friendly. Then and only then can we breathe easy and proudly exclaim Jai Ho Calcutta!

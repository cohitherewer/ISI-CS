The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Gang robs jewellery, cash from house
                                                                                                               Gang robs jewellery, cash from house
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A gang robbed jewellery and cash worth over Rs 2 lakh after breaking into a Garia house early on Thursday and beating up its middle-aged owner and his mother.         
	Tapas Karmakar, 51, had forgotten to close the collapsible gate of the three-storeyed house at Kamdouri Purbapara on Wednesday night. The gang of four laid siege between 2.30am to 3.45am, said police. They ignored the ground floor, let out to a family, and broke the lock on the first-floor gate to enter the portion where the Karmakars live.         
	Since the family was in the jewellery trade, there were a lot of ornaments in the house. The robbers ransacked an iron safe, a steel cupboard and a wooden wardrobe and took away mainly jewellery and utensils along with Rs 8,000 in cash. They also took seven guineas and ornaments from the puja room, said a relative.         
	According to 75-year-old Gouri Karmakar, who was discharged from a nursing home a week ago after undergoing treatment for cardiac problems, the robbers first entered her son Tapass room.        
	They asked him to hand over the keys to the cupboards, safes and wardrobes at gunpoint. When he resisted, they started hitting him. When I tried to save my son, they punched me in the face and gave me a shove. They also snatched two gold chains from my neck, she said.

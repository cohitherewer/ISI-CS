          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Police are looking for a youth who has allegedly cheated at least 30 people of around Rs 1.2 lakh by promising them a trip to Mecca to guide Haj pilgrims.        
	A team from Ekbalpore police station raided the house of Mohammad Belal on Dent Mission Road on Sunday but he could not be found.        
	Around 30 people complained on Saturday that Belal went missing after promising them a trip to Mecca as Haj volunteers and taking Rs 3,000-4,000 from each. The youth had also taken their passports, said Abdul Kader, the officer-in-charge of Ekbalpore police station.        
	Yahya Khan, a member of the West Bengal Haj Committee, said: It is a serious crime. The youth should be arrested immediately.         
	According to Khan, Haj volunteers are selected by the state government, which also bears the cost of their journey and stay in Saudi Arabia.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rights scan on traction mix-up
                                                                                                               Rights scan on traction mix-up
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The state human rights commission on Friday sought a report from the SSKM Hospital superintendent on how 94-year-old Promila Dey, who had broken her right leg, got traction on her left.        
	Justice Narayan Chandra Sil, the acting chairman of the state human rights commission, wrote to the hospital superintendent informing him that the panel had taken suo motu cognisance of the incident. A detailed report must be submitted within seven days, said Promilas son Rupayan, an official of the panel.        
	Justice Shyamal Sen, a former chairman of the commission, visited the patient on Friday. In his presence, orthopaedic surgeon Samar Gupta, under whom Promila was admitted, apologised for the mistake. Surajit Kundu, a member of the house staff, had set the left leg in traction and then the right leg after Rupayan lodged a complaint.        
	Hospital sources said the medical board that probed the incident had found Gupta guilty of negligence.        
	Promila underwent an ECG and chest X-ray on Friday, which did not reveal any problem. She had complained of feeling very weak and not being able to move.

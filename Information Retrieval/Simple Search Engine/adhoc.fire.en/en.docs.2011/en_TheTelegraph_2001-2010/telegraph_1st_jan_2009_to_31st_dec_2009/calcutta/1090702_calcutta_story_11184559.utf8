	The National Security Guard (NSG) commandos posted in Calcutta will have a permanent address by the end of November.        
	The deadline for making the campus at Badu, off Madhyamgram Choumatha, functional was announced by the director-general of the NSG, N.P.S. Aulakh, at the inauguration of the commando hub at Salt Lake stadium on Wednesday evening.        
	We have asked the National Buildings Construction Corporation to build the campus and expect to move in by the end of November, said Aulakh.        
	Till the 23-acre campus is ready, the NSG will operate from its temporary base at the stadium. About 250 commandos are posted in Calcutta.        
	The hub is operational now. We are ready to act from today, declared Aulakh on Wednesday.        
	According to him, the NSG will collaborate with the state police, providing cops training in VIP security and bomb disposal.        
	Land is being scouted for the regional NSG centre in the state, which will have 5,000-plus commandos.        
	The hub is going to function more like a quick response team. Once the regional centre comes up, the state police will benefit from it in terms of weapons training and tips on new methods of bomb disposal, said state chief secretary Ashok Mohan Chakrabarti.        
	The presence of the NSG in the state will also increase the confidence of the state police, added Chakrabarti.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Vestiges of vote clutter
                                                                                                               Vestiges of vote clutter
          ONTHESPOT - POLL LITTER                            A Mamata Banerjee hoarding in Gariahat and (above) one of Md Salim on Alimuddin Street. Pictures by Talat Salahuddin                                 
	The victors and the vanquished have disappeared. The party workers have returned to their barracks. The chief electoral officer (CEO) is folding up his office by May 20. But the poll festoons, hoardings and flexes on the roadside remain. Long after the dust has settled over the 15th general elections, its telltale vestiges are yet to go.         
	From Mullickbazar-CIT Road to Hazra-Bhowanipore-Behala and Jadavpur, every lane, bylane and thoroughfare remain littered with life-size cutouts, party flags, buntings and flexes.         
	Most of the hoardings and festoons are of Md Salim, Mamata Banerjee and Rabin Deb. At Hazra, flexes of Mamata Banerjee and Rabin Deb block the cityscape. Life-size cutouts of the Trinamul chief overlook the thoroughfare at Gariahat, Picnic Garden Road and Hazra. Similar cutouts of Md Salim stare down at pedestrians at Sealdah and CIT Road.        
	Who is going to make the effort of removing these eyesores? The office of the CEO? The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC)? The city police or the political parties? None of them were willing to do the job. Each passed the buck with evasive answers.        
	CEOspeak: The election commission will play its role till May 20. It is the duty of the police and the civic authorities to remove the banners and hoardings, said Debashis Sen.                   AJC Bose Road remains littered with party flags            A Rabin Deb hoarding in Calcutta South      
	CMCspeak: The election commission, before the polls, had directed the CMC to remove the cutouts, festoons and banners. The CMC, along with the political parties, had done so from different parts of the city, said mayoral council member (information and culture) Faiyaz Ahmed Khan.        
	Policespeak: The police by themselves do not pull down festoons and posters. If any authority, be it the CMC or the pollution control board or the PWD, decide to pull them down, we will provide necessary assistance, said a senior officer at Lalbazar.              
	Calcuttans feel the work of cleaning up the mess should be done by the political parties and their leaders.         
	Citizenspeak:        
	The load of posters, festoons and cutouts has been heavy this time. There are more Trinamul festoons in our area since it is their stronghold. I think those who have hoisted them should behave responsibly and pull them down now, said Dilip Gupta of Manoharpukur Road.         
	In my area, there are more CPM festoons and banners. I can say from experience that these will remain where they are, said Sk Chand of APC Road.        
	People have started pulling down some of the hoardings here but there are many more left in the lanes and bylanes. I dont know if they will be removed at all, said Mohan Kumar of Serpentine Lane in Sealdah.

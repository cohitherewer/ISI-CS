The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Necessity vs health concerns
                                                                                                                 We Ask You Answer      Necessity vs health concerns
          Todays question: Are you riding polluting two-stroke autorickshaws?                                                         Dipanwita Banerjee, 
  Howrah        
	No, I am not riding two-stroke autorickshaws. I dont want to go against government rules and deteriorate my health. Anyone who wants to commit suicide can ride two-stroke autorickshaws.               
	

RANAJIT MUKHERJEE, 
  Park Circus         
	Riding the polluting two-stroke autos means committing suicide. The few four-stroke autos are helping us amid the on-going transport problem. A general awareness should be created to make people quit polluting autos.               
	

A.K. Sen, 
  Ballygunge         
	I have no choice but to use two-stroke autos because there is usually a long queue to board an auto irrespective of stroke classification. The government can seize two stroke autos or stop the auto drivers from using katatel.               
	

Sarit Kumar Datta, 
  Gopal Ghosh Lane        
	No, I dont. I dont have Mamata Banerjees mentality and politics. If anything is banned a self-respected citizen must honour it and help to implement it.               
	

Madhabi D. Ghosh,
  Salt Lake         
	Certainly not. I avoid riding autorickshaws, specially in Calcutta, for their rude behaviour, be it two-stroke or four-stroke. Normally I walk anywhere within two/three km, but beyond that I take a bus. If the administration is not taking a step to bring down the pollution level, commuters should do so.              
	

Anam Arif,
  Barrackpore        
	It is a shame for Bengal is still riding polluting autos and political parties are backing them. What responsible political parties we have! I request all Calcuttans not to board autorickshaws until they switch to a cleaner fuel. When Beijing can, Delhi can, then why cant we?         
	

Ajit Kumar Das, 
  Ghusury, Howrah         
	Yes, I am riding two-stroke autos to reach my destination on time. But I think two-stroke autos should be replaced by four-strokes autos.               
	

Mihir Kanungo, 
  Polytechnic Road         
	I fully support the introduction of four stroke autos instead of the two-stroke ones plying now. For the sake of a pollution-free city LPG-run auto is a must. At this moment, a handful of such autos are available which cannot meet the necessity of the huge number commuters. Therefore we have no other option but to ride the two-stroke autos.              
	

Asok Kumar Chatterjee, 
  Konnagar, Hooghly         
	If two-stroke autorickshaws ply on the road I must ride them to reach my work place in time. Necessity knows no law.         
	

Gautam Kumar Mazumdar, 
  Basirhat        
	Yes, I am still riding two-stroke autorickshaws as they are still plying on the road.               
	

Sushanta Bhowmick, 
  Nimta        
	I am compelled to ride two-stroke autorickshaws. The state should take steps to increase the number of four-stroke autorickshaws.              
	

Dilip Kumar Biswas, 
  Green Park         
	No civilised person should ride a two-stroke autorickshaw as it pollutes the air. But people ride it unknowingly. Moreover, two-stroke autos are still plying on the roads. Everyone is compelled to ride them.              
	

Indranil Sanyal, 
  Dhakuria         
	Since I have a motorcycle, I dont ride autorickshaws. But, given a choice, I would prefer to ride an auto running on LPG. It is reported that one in every seven citizens in our metropolis suffers from respiratory diseases. The prime reason behind such pathetic scenario is the high presence of polluted particles in the air. We cannot afford to encourage the pollutants. Enough is enough.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Campus call heard beyond borders
                                                                                                               Campus call heard beyond borders
          CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE                          St Xaviers College is emerging as a preferred destination of foreign students                                  
	St Xaviers College is going glocal, with students from various parts of Asia eyeing the Park Street address.        
	Calcuttas first autonomous college has received a number of applications from south and southeast Asia, for admission to various courses.        
	Ever since the admission process went online, anyone can apply from anywhere. We have received applications from various countries, said Father Felix Raj, the principal of the college.        
	Applications have come in from Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Korea and Bangladesh, mainly for courses in microbiology, biotechnology, management and commerce.        
	Quite some time ago, we had a few students from abroad but the demand went down because of central government restrictions. It has picked up again, said Father Felix Raj.        
	One of the reasons for the rise in demand is the education system being followed at Xaviers. We have put in place a semester and credit system similar to that followed abroad. This has made the college a suitable destination for foreign students, added the principal.        
	The college is also moving towards a cafeteria system under which a student can choose from all the subjects taught on campus.        
	A student can specialise in any subject as long as he or she covers 130 credits  units earned after successful completion of a course  in six semesters required by honours students.        
	St Xaviers has drawn up a separate fee structure for foreign students, who have to fork out three times the amount paid by home students under each head. For example, a foreign student studying English honours will have to pay three times the yearly admission fee paid by home students, which is Rs 1,500, three times the monthly tuition fee, which is Rs 375, and so on.        
	The semester and credit system has also facilitated tie-ups with foreign universities for student exchange.        
	There is programme with Manitoba University, Canada, which will send around 15 to 20 students for one semester to the Park Street campus in January.        
	There are also student and faculty exchange programmes with Saint Johns University, Minnesota, Canisius College, Buffalo and Sogang University, Seoul.        
	The number of foreign applications would go up if the college is able to provide accommodation, feels the principal.        
	Currently, we have two hostels that can house 250 students, so foreigners have to look for accommodation outside the college. Our next project will be a new hostel so that we can accommodate more students, said Father Felix Raj.        
	More foreign students would also necessitate a balancing act. Increasing presence of foreign students would add to the cosmopolitan character of the campus, but we must maintain a balance so that city students dont lose out, said the principal.

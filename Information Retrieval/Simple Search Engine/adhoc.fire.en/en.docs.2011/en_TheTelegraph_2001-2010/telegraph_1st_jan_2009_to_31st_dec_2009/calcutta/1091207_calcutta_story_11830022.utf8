          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The former driver of the couple who were found dead in their Jadavpur home on Friday night was arrested on Sunday. Bapi Raut, 25, was charged with killing Kalyan Moitra ,72, and his wife Mridula, 65.        
	Bapi was arrested in his Baghajatin house. A preliminary probe revealed that he had killed the couple, said the South 24-Parganas additional superintendent of police (industrial), S.K. Chaudhury.         
	The couples bodies bearing stab wounds were discovered by their son-in-law Dipanjan Bhattacharya, who came to check on them after phone calls to their Sree Colony residence went unanswered since Thursday night.        
	We have not found the murder weapon yet. We are interrogating Bapi to ascertain the motive behind the murders, added Chaudhury.        
	The police suspect the couple were murdered on Thursday night. Neighbours had told the cops that Bapi was sacked before Puja because of his irregular attendance and frequent demands for loans.         
	Bapi was angry and committed the murders for revenge, said an officer.         
	The cops are probing whether cash or valuables were stolen from the couples home. The couple let Bapi inside the house as they knew him. We are trying to find whether he had an accomplice, said the officer.

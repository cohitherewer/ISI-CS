The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | April-March session for ICSE-ISC
                                                                                                               April-March session for ICSE-ISC
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bad news for students of ICSE-ISC schools who were hoping to get more time before the board exams.        
	The Delhi-based Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations, which conducts the ICSE (Class X) and ISC (Class XII) tests, has urged its affiliated schools to stick to the April-March session.        
	Many schools want to switch to the January-December session. But since the council will keep holding the ICSE-ISC tests in March, the schools would do better to follow the present system, council officials said while addressing the annual conference of the heads of Anglo-Indian schools, held in Calcutta this week.        
	The council officials, however, pointed out that the schools were free to choose their own session for the internal tests, provided they met certain criteria like holding classes for at least 210 days a year. But most principals insisted on following a uniform pattern for the benefit of the students.         
	We want to stick to the April-March session because most schools across the country follow it, said Gilian Rosemary Hart, the principal of Welland Gouldsmith School.        
	After the state government announced its plan in 2007 to shift to the January-December session, many ICSE-ISC schools in the city planned to opt for it. The students had hoped that they would get more time to prepare for the board tests in the new system.        
	St James is still planning to opt for the new session.

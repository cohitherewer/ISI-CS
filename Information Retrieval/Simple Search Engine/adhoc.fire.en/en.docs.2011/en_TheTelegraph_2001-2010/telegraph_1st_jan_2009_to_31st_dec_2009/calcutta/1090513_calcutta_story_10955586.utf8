                                                                                                               Video clue to lost jewellery
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A wedding video has helped cops recover jewellery worth Rs 3.5 lakh left behind in a taxi that brought one of the guests to the venue.        
	Basanti Lohia got off the taxi outside the Ballygunge Park house on May 2 evening, immediately after the groom arrived, and rushed inside, leaving behind three suitcases containing jewellery. The 42-year-old had lodged a complaint with Karaya police station but harboured little hope of getting back the valuables since she could not remember the number of the taxi or any detail about the driver.        
	We got a copy of the wedding video and checked the part where the groom enters the venue. We saw a fleeting glimpse of the taxi that Lohia had taken behind the grooms car. We could see only a part of the taxis registration number, said an officer.        
	The investigators summoned the drivers of 15 taxis whose registration numbers included the letters and digits that could be read from the licence plate of the cab that ferried Lohia.One of the drivers, Ranjit Prasad Chaurasia, a resident of Parnasree, confessed he had handed the suitcases to a relative in Beleghata, added the officer.        
	The cops recovered the bags and their contents and handed them to Lohia on Tuesday.

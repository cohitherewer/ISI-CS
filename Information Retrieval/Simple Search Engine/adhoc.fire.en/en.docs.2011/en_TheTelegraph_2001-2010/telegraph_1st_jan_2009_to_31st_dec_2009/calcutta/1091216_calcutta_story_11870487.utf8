The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fairground not ready
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Fairground not ready
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Milon Mela looks far from ready to host the seasons first big fair that starts a week later, belying the governments claim on Tuesday that the infrastructure had been upgraded.        
	The infrastructure at Milon Mela is ready... all (facilities) are ready though they may not be perfect, industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen said at the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry office on Tuesday afternoon. The chamber is organising the Industrial India Trade Fair at the permanent fairground, off the Bypass, from December 24.        
	Metro visited Milon Mela in the evening and found it lacking in some basic facilities.

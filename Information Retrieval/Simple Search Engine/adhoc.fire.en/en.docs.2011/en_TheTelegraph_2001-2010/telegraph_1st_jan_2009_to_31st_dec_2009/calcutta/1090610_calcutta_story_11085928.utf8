The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Crater on runway, flight in air
                                                                                                               Crater on runway, flight in air
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	A Lufthansa flight that covered Frankfurt to Calcutta in nine hours took more than four hours to land because of a crater at one end of the runway and high tailwind at the other.        
	Flight commandant Butt Kerit Lutz flew the Airbus A-330 with 225 passengers on board to Hyderabad after circling the airport for 45 minutes and making two abortive landing attempts from the southern side between 11 and 11.44pm on Monday.         
	When the flight reached Hyderabad, the passengers were told that they wouldnt be allowed to get off because immigration rules dont permit unscheduled disembarking except during emergencies.         
	The aircraft stood on the tarmac for more than an hour for refuelling and other checks.        
	The Airbus finally returned to the city and made a safe landing at 4.30am, but the passengers ordeal wasnt over.        
	All 225 people on board the aircraft were forced to wait an additional 30 minutes at the terminal because members of the swine flu squad were not ready to examine them.        
	An official explained that the team was not present at the terminals medical counter when the flight touched down because it was an unscheduled arrival.        
	The tired passengers could troop out of the terminal only after the medical team arrived and examined them for symptoms of swine flu.        
	Dipankar Bhattacharya, a city-based techie returning from an official assignment in the US, said he and wife Gargi were physically and mentally drained after the experience in the air and on the ground. We were flying back home through Frankfurt and I could never have imagined it would come to this, he said.        
	Flight number LS 750 was on schedule when it entered Calcutta airspace around 10.50pm. Lutz was aligning the aircraft for landing when air traffic control (ATC) alerted him to a crater three feet wide and four inches deep on the northern end of the primary runway, where flights normally land.        
	The Airbus hovered above the city for the next 45 minutes waiting for the force of the tailwind to lessen.        
	Two JetLite flights from Bangalore and Mumbai, a Jet Airways flight from Delhi and China Eastern Airlines Kunmin-Calcutta flight touched down from the southern side between 10.45pm and 11.39pm. But Lutz and his co-pilots wouldnt take a chance with the tailwind.        
	The pilot announced that there was some problem on the runway, so we would land from the other end and that it would take five to six minutes. However, just when the aircraft was nearing ground it gained altitude again. The pilot made a second attempt later and we seemed to touch the runway, only to take off again. That unnerved us a bit, recalled Dipankar.        
	According to a senior pilot with a domestic airline, take-off or landing is always at the discretion of the flight commander or captain. If he feels it is unsafe, you have to accept that.        
	A Lufthansa spokesperson said passenger safety was paramount and the flight commander took the decision to abort landing because he thought it would be unsafe to proceed.        
	The pilot was informed about the pothole on the northern side during the final approach, and the tailwind at the other end was heavy. Our passengers were taken care of well and served refreshments on board during the waiting period, he added.        
	The return flight to Frankfurt took off at 6am instead of the scheduled departure at 12.05am. Two of the 174 passengers missed the flight because they left the airport without checking in, possibly thinking that the flight would be cancelled because of the problems on the runway.        
	The crater on the runway was spotted at 10.45pm by the pilot of Paramount Airlines Calcutta-Chennai flight.         
	Minutes after take-off, the pilot told ATC that there was a pothole on the northern side of the runway. A team reached the runway and found that the upper crust had peeled off at that spot, creating a crater four inches deep and two to three feet in diameter, said an official of the Airports Authority of India.         
	The wheels of a heavy aircraft could have created the crater while landing, a source said.         
	Work is underway to peel off the rubber deposits on the runway. There is a possibility that the joint of the relaid surface and the existing layer is weak, he explained.        
	The airport authorities closed the northern side of the runway immediately after the crater was detected and directed the ATC to guide all approaching aircraft to the southern end, which has a separate Instrument Landing System.        
	According to ATC personnel who were on duty on Monday night, the pilots of the JetLite, Jet Airways and China Eastern Airlines flights did not mention any difficulty in landing from the southern side because of the tailwind.

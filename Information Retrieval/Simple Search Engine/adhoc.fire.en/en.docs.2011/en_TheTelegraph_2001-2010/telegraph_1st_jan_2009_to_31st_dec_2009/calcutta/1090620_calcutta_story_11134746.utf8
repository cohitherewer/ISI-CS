The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Wanted councillor alleges cop plot
                                                                                                               Wanted councillor alleges cop plot
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Iqbal Ahmed                                  
	Congress councillor Iqbal Ahmed, absconding after allegedly inciting a mob to attack police and block traffic in the New Market area on Thursday, called Metro twice on Friday to claim that he had been framed.        
	Iqbal, the younger brother of the Union minister of state for tourism, Sultan Ahmed, allegedly wanted to teach the police a lesson for arresting a Free School Street shop-owner who was close to him.        
	The allegations against me are politically motivated. I rushed to the spot after getting a call from local traders who said they were being harassed by men from New Market police station. They are my voters and being the local councillor it is my duty to protect them, Iqbal said over the phone around 11.30am on Friday.         
	I was the first to call up senior police officers. I requested them to arrive on the spot immediately. Things went out of control when cops lathicharged a group of people protesting police highhandedness, he added.         
	The group of 250-300 had blocked the busy Free School Street-Marquis Street crossing to protest the arrest of Shahnawaz Alam.        
	The mob damaged two police vehicles and a tram on Ripon Street. Policemen had to fire tear gas shells to disperse the crowd.        
	Shahnawaz was arrested along with his landlords Imran and Osman on Tuesday after they filed complaints against each other. Local traders took offence when they saw policemen tying a rope around Shahnawazs waist to escort him to the court on Wednesday.        
	Iqbal, who next called around 6pm, said Shahnawaz was not his relative, as the police had claimed on Thursday.        
	The three protesters who were arrested in connection with the violence were remanded in police custody for 14 days on Friday.        
	Their bail pleas were rejected. They are being interrogated to ascertain who incited them to attack the policemen. Iqbal Ahmed is still absconding, said Samir Gupta, the officer-in-charge of New Market police station.

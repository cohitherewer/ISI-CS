                      A decorative canvas                    Scion of the Van Cleef dynasty, Olaf Van Cleef is a counsellor of high range jewellery at Cartier since 1982. Also an artist and a painter, he is not new to India, having held several exhibitions in the country including Calcutta. His ongoing solo show of paintings is based on abstract pointillism and tachisme. Van Cleefs technique consists of softening the irregular dabs of bright watercolours with multiple dots in white. Painting like the jeweller that he is, he also uses metallic paper and Swarovsky crystals in his works. His style of tachisme, which he acquired from painting by using just his fingers, is characterised by spontaneous lines that remind one of calligraphy. His widespread travels across the country are also vividly portrayed in his paintings. The artist admits that his work reflects his enduring fascination with India, a country he has been coming back to many times a year for over two decades now. His works are loaded with local references to which the artist gives a totally new meaning. For instance, the Hindu deities, who make regular appearances, have nothing to do with religion, but are, to the contrary, icons of contemporary society. Themes and motifs like elephants, Nandi (Lord Shivas bull) and Narasimha also abound in his bejewelled paintings.

  - Aamir in disguise stopped, hero returns for dinner treat          PRATIM D. GUPTA                          Aamir in disguise denied entry into the Ganguly home on Tuesday evening (courtesy STAR Ananda); Aamir, Sourav, Sana, Dona and Kiran at the dinner table  (below)                                              
	Seedhe log, sada bhes/ Kahin pe pyaar, kahin pe dwesh/ Aap sabko mera sandes/ Mein to chala mere dada ke des.        
	When Kareena Kapoor read out this cryptic clue on Monday at Pranpur in Chanderi, Madhya Pradesh, many thought that Aamir Khans next stop in his seven-city 3 Idiots contest tour would explore his paternal grandfathers (dada) roots, after having visiting his mothers cradle Varanasi in the guise of a Banarasi babu.        
	But Aamirs dada turned out to be Calcuttas Dada  Sourav Ganguly  and so Bollywoods big boy landed up in Behala on Tuesday evening.        
	Two days after Shah Rukh Khan had kept Sourav waiting for five hours before appearing as the special guest on his quiz show Dadagiri, Sourav kept Aamir Khan waiting in front of his Biren Roy Road residence.        
	But thats how Aamir the Idiot wanted it, having turned up in disguise  a messy long-haired wig, thin glasses and an arm full of coloured tattoos  around 4pm announcing hum Sourav Ganguly se milna chahte hain. The securityman at the Ganguly house drove the strange-looking fan away, who went around asking, Dada kahan hai?        
	At that time Sourav was stroking a Ranji century at the JU grounds in Salt Lake against Delhi. Then he played chief guest at a school function and only while returning home after 8pm did he get to know about the uninvited  but very welcome  guest at home. In the intervening hours, Aamir had checked into Taj Bengal with wife Kiran Rao, taken off his punk backpacker get-up and returned to the Ganguly home as Aamir Khan, in T-shirt and jeans.        
	Kiran, an ex-student of Loreto House, is a huge Sourav fan and insisted she accompany Aamir to dada ke des on the 3 Idiots promo trek. When Dada escorted his star guests into the house, Aamir shared with him all the masti of how he was stopped at the Ganguly gate, proving that the security was very good.                          
	The next stop was the ground floor drawing room where Aamir went wow and my god at all of Souravs trophies. You really stopped playing too early we fans were not ready for you to retire, he told his host, who said he was fed up of being on trial all the time. Upstairs, Aamir met Souravs mother and gushed about the most graceful player who made a historic comeback.        
	It was time for dinner but Aamir and Kiran chose to wait for Dona, who hadnt returned from a dance recital. Once Mrs Ganguly returned, the two couples (along with little Sana) sat down to have the best Bengali meal ever, according to Aamir. Tuesday means strictly vegetarian fare at the Ganguly house but Aamir loved his shukto and posto, which he polished off with luchi.        
	A great dinner is how Aamir described it to Modhurima Sinha of Taj Bengal, before leaving the Alipore hotel on Wednesday after a regular breakfast in his suite, plus a south-Indian platter of dosa and idli.        
	Even as Aamir in disguise was checking in at the star address on Tuesday evening, after revealing his identity, his Varanasi host was facing the heat from the UP police. The owner of the Mughalsarai hotel in which he had stayed incognito during his Varanasi visit was served a showcause notice for not having verified the identity of the guest.        
	Back in Behala, well past midnight, Aamir gifted Sourav a gold ring, invited him for the premiere of 3 Idiots in Mumbai on December 23, and called him a great human being, exactly what Sourav had called Shah Rukh just a couple of nights ago.        
	The scoreline? S.C. Ganguly caught Khan bowled Khan.

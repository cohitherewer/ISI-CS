The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Jail clashes prompt security boost
                                                                                                               Jail clashes prompt security boost
          DEBASHIS CHATTOPADHYAY AND IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                                              SAFETY SCAN: Alipore Central jail       
	The jail department is tightening the vigil on employees and visitors at correctional homes to prevent clashes among inmates.         
	The recent clash between inmates at Alipore Central jail has led to the formation of a team to hunt the black sheep among employees.        
	We have found out that some warders regularly supply cellphones and contraband to inmates. The team will keep a tab on the warders under suspicion, said a senior officer of the department.        
	Members of the team will also frisk warders when they enter and leave the Alipore premises, which is home to criminals like American Center attack mastermind Aftab Ansari.        
	A similar team will be put in place at Presidency jail, which too has witnessed gang wars. The teams will work in tandem with the jail superintendent and the chief head warder.        
	Also on the anvil are X-ray scanners to stop the entry of contraband into jails, the additional director-general of police and inspector-general of correctional services, B.D. Sharma, said.        
	The machines, manufactured indigenously at a cost Rs 20 lakh, will initially be installed in Presidency, Alipore Central and Dum Dum Central jails. They will be useful for scanning tiffin boxes brought by visitors for inmates, said an officer.        
	According to employees, drugs are often smuggled into jails in tiffin boxes. Some warders too bring in contraband. On July 19, a warder of Alipore Central jail was suspended after drugs which he had allegedly bought to sell to inmates, were found in his possession.        
	The authorities plan to install phone booths in jail for inmates to stop cellphones from being brought in. An inmate will be allowed to use the phone once a week to talk to his or her relatives or lawyer, said an officer.        
	Several warders have been posted at the jails for more than three years, in violation of norms. We are preparing a listing of employees posted at the jails for several years, added the officer.

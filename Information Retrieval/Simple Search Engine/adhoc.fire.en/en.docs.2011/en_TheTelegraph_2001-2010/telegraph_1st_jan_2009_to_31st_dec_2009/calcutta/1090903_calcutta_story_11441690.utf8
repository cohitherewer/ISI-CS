	A young man with one kidney was brutally assaulted by a group of cops for daring to protest when they were raining blows on another youth caught riding a motorcycle without a helmet.        
	Sheikh Rahim, 23, ended up in a nursing home with bruises and severe abdominal pain  he had undergone surgery four years ago to remove a diseased kidney  for standing up for the stranger.        
	The accountancy student at the Institute of Computer Accountants on Maniktala Main Road had just stepped out of the building around noon on Wednesday when he saw a sergeant and four colleagues hitting the two-wheeler rider in front of a police kiosk.        
	Several other pedestrians saw the cops slap and strike the man with batons but Rahim decided he wouldnt be just another silent spectator.         
	Apnara oke marchhen keno? Or jodi kono bhul thake apnara aain anujaye or birudhhe byabostha nin (Why are you hitting him? If he is at fault, take action according to the law), the Rajabazar resident shouted, rushing towards the kiosk.        
	The slap-happy sergeant, Joyjit Saha, turned around and shot back: Tor ki retui ke? (Whats your problemwho are you?        
	Saha and the other policemen then let go of the two-wheeler rider and pounced on Rahim. I pleaded with them not to hit me and told them that I had undergone kidney surgery, but they wouldnt listen. The sergeant even pulled out his service revolver and threatened to shoot me, the youth told Metro.        
	As Rahim collapsed in pain, fellow students from the institute and the pedestrians who were inert moments earlier ran to his rescue.        
	But sergeant Saha was not through with teaching the youth a lesson for questioning his right to assault a traffic-rule offender. The policemen tried to drag me into a taxi and probably take me to the police station for another round of beating. Fortunately, students of my institute stepped in, Rahim recalled.        
	But according to the joint commissioner of police (headquarters), Jawed Shamim, it was Rahim who was guilty of assaulting an officer rather than the other way round.                    The kiosk at Maniktala. (Sanat Kr Sinha)     
	The sergeant and his team had intercepted one Raj Mohan Jha for not wearing a helmet. Jha was not ready to pay the stipulated fine, which prompted the sergeant to take him into the kiosk for questioning. It was then that Rahim stepped in and manhandled the officer along with some other students of the institution, he said.        
	Shamim said Jha took advantage of the commotion and sped away on his motorcycle. The sergeant was injured in the incident. We have registered a case against Rahim for assaulting a police officer on duty, he added.        
	A doctor at the nursing home where Rahim was treated confirmed marks of assault on the youths body. We need to monitor whether his kidney has been affected, he said.        
	Rahim has lodged a complaint with Phoolbagan police station about unprovoked assault by Saha and his colleagues.

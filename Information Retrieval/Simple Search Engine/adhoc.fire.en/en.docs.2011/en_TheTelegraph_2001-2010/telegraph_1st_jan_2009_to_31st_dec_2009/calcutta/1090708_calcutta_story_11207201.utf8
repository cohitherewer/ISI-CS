	The transport department will launch a fleet of modern, comfortable buses in the city next month.         
	According to the plan, 300 AC and 900 non-AC buses, manufactured by Volvo, Tata and Leyland, will hit the city roads in the next three months.        
	The trial run of the new buses has been successfully completed. The buses will start plying on regular city routes from August, said the managing director of the West Bengal Surface Transport Corporation (WBSTC), Ashis Kumar Thakur.        
	The buses are likely to be deployed on Airport-Esplanade, Howrah-Sealdah, Garia-Dakshineswar, Garia-Belur Math, Howrah-Joka, Airport-Salt Lake and Garia-Dankuni routes initially, said an official of the WBSTC.        
	There will be seats for 41 passengers in each bus. Standing will also be allowed. The route of each bus will be displayed on LED boards at the front and back of the vehicles. Stops will be announced through public address system, like in Metro Railway. Prepaid tickets will also be available for daily passengers, added the official.         
	Additional chief secretary Sumantra Chowdhury said introduction of the buses will cost Rs 400 crore, which has been provided under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission.        
	The fare structure of the AC buses is yet to be decided. The fares of the non-AC buses will be the same as that of the existing WBSTC buses.

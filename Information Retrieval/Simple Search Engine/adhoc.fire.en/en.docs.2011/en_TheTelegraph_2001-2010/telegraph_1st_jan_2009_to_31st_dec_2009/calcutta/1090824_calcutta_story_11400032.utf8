The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Four more down with swine flu
                                                                                                               Four more down with swine flu
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Four more swine flu cases were detected on Sunday, taking the number of people affected by the H1N1 virus in the city to 73.        
	Health department officials said 14 swine flu patients were being treated at various hospitals in the state. In the city, the patients are being treated at Infectious Diseases Hospital in Beleghata and MR Bangur Hospital in Tollygunge.        
	The latest victims, whose nasal and throat swabs were tested at the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases (Niced), have been identified as Sanjay Saha, 33, Pranati Sharma Sarkar, 32, Subhajit Bose, 24, and Manjari Pal, 13.        
	Pranati Sharma Sarkars one-and-a-half-year-old daughter Isha had earlier tested positive for swine flu. The mother might have contracted the virus from the child, said a doctor at the Beleghata hospital.         
	Samples too many: Niced officials have expressed their inability to handle the huge number of samples that are arriving every day for the H1N1 test.        
	The institute, senior deputy director Sekhar Chakraborty said, is receiving more than 100 samples every day against its capacity to handle only 50. This is resulting in a days delay in readying the results, he said. We have officially informed the state health department about the growing pressure, Chakraborty added.        
	Last week, a Niced team had visited the laboratory of Desun Hospital off the Bypass to verify whether it had the facilities to conduct swine flu tests.         
	Health department sources said the process of creating isolation units at private hospitals was yet to take off. We expect to finalise things soon, said a senior official at Swastha Bhavan.

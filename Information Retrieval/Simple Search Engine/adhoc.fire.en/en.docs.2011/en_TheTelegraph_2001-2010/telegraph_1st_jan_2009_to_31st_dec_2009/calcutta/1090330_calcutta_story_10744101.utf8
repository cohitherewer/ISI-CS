The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Car hits pregnant woman
                                                                                                               Car hits pregnant woman
  - Driver and friend arrested for drinking in speeding WagonR          A STAFF REPORTER                                              Shampa Chakraborty    
	A 26-year-old pregnant homemaker was seriously injured after being hit by a speeding car that spun out of control because the driver was allegedly drinking at the wheel.        
	Shampa Chakrabarty, a resident of Raja Basanta Roy Road in south Calcutta, may lose her baby because of real estate broker Vinay Singhs alleged callousness, police said.        
	Doctors at Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratishthan, where Shampa underwent a sonogram late on Sunday, said they couldnt confirm immediately whether the four-month-old foetus had survived the accident.         
	 The womans condition is not critical but the foetus might not have survived. A sonogram has been done but the result can be confirmed only after a gynaecologist checks the radiologists report, a spokesperson for Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratishthan said.         
	Shampa was standing on the pavement in front of her home around 4.15pm when a WagonR driven by Vinay rammed into a lamp post and hit her. Lifted off the pavement on impact, she crashed against the wall of the house.        
	I was with her when this happened. We saw the car coming at us. I took evasive action but Shampa couldnt. The car hit the lamp post, smashed the buckets in front of our house and rammed into Shampa, said relative Dipali Som.        
	Shampa, whose husband Amit works in a private firm, was knocked unconscious and suffered multiple fractures. Her pelvic bone and femur have been fractured, a doctor said.        
	Vinay, 35, was with three other men  all in their 30s  when the accident occurred.         
	A police officer quoted witnesses as saying that Vinay, a resident of Golf Green, was allegedly holding a bottle of beer in his left hand while driving.         
	 His friend Ajit Gupta was sitting to his left while the other two, Harjinder Singh and Pappu Walia, were in the backseat. The quartet had been drinking for some time in their office in the same area before setting off for a late-afternoon joyride. They were all carrying beer bottles, said Uma Shankar Ojha, the officer-in-charge of Tollygunge police station.        
	Residents of the area turned violent after spotting the beer bottles in the car. They dragged out two of the men and assaulted them. Vinay and Ajit were manhandled but the other two fled, said Ojha.         
	Vinay and Ajit were arrested and sent for medical tests.

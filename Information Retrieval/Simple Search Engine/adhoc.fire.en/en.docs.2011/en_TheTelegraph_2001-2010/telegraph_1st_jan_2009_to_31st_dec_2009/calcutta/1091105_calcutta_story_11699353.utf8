          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Around 3,800 cops will keep vigil at Nandan and its surroundings for the 15th Calcutta Film Festival, double the number deployed last year.         
	Citing the political turmoil in the state and a perceived threat from Maoists, police outlined the elaborate security arrangements being made for the eight-day festival starting on November 10.         
	We will keep vigil through 28 closed-circuit television cameras, seven of them installed recently, said an officer of the special branch, the city polices intelligence wing.        
	The situation is very volatile, admitted the officer, hinting at fears of a Maoist attack and the possibility of Opposition-backed protests near the venue. All 48 police stations in the city have been asked to keep an eye on entry and exit points to the city.         
	The festival will be inaugurated by film-maker Mani Ratnam and screen 228 films from 56 countries at Nandan I, II amp; III, Rabindra Sadan, Sisir Mancha, Madhusudan Mancha, New Empire, Purbashree, SRFTI and Girish Mancha.         
	Recounting protest rallies near Nandan on the Nandigram issue during the festival in 2007, the officer said the police were taking all steps to ensure that the authorities did not suffer a loss of face this year. A police team will monitor crowd movement round-the-clock through CCTVs, he explained.        
	Officers of other intelligence wings have been asked to keep tabs on political events in the state and alert officers in charge of security in case of an emergency.         
	A separate plan has been drawn up for VIPs and other invitees. VIPs and invitees will be provided with bodyguards, who will keep us informed about their movements. Bullet-proof cars will be used to ferry dignitaries and VIPs, said an officer.         
	Security checks will be carried out at the theatres where films will be screened as part of the festival.

                      Paean of love                    Life is about trusting your feelings and taking chances, losing and finding happiness, appreciating the memories, learning from the past, and realizing people change        Medieval Indian literature is a rich treasure trove of original plots, sectarian in nature, designed to advance or to celebrate some unorthodox regional belief. Celebrating Love, the ongoing exhibition of paintings by Dhiren Sasmal, is a tribute to the legendary writings of Indian classical writers like Kalidasa and Bharatchandra that have enchanted and inspired lovers through the ages. Sasmals acrylic works on canvas transport viewers to an enchanted world where human beings live in harmony with nature. Pablo Picasso had once remarked, The artist is a receptacle for emotions that come from all over the place; from the sky, from the earth, from a scrap of paper, from a passing shape, from a spiders web.... Sasmal, who began his career illustrating book covers, has already received numerous prestigious awards for his works, including the Sishu Sahitya Sansad Puraskar, Best Illustrator for Leela Majumdars Guper Guptodhan and Little Magazine Puja Edition Best Cover Designer (1983). He is flexible and capable of producing attractive literary theme-oriented paintings within a restricted frame. His works depict an easy grace, capturing the essence of the subject deftly. His canvases stoke the layer of memories lying in the subconscious mind and leave a strain of strange nostalgic feeling wherein the viewer can identify oneself with the subject.

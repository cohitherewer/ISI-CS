The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Roadhog pandal denied clearance
                                                                                                               Roadhog pandal denied clearance
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The fire services department on Monday refused a clearance to the Durga puja organised by the RK Chatterjee Road Adhibasi Brinda in Kasba. Two officers of the fire department inspected the pandal and the surrounding areas on Sunday.        
	The width of the road is 22ft. At its narrowest point the pandal is 18ft wide, and at its widest point, 20ft. This violates fire safety norms, said a senior officer of the fire services. We have informed the organisers about our decision and the reasons behind it.        
	Justice S. Banerjee of the high court had ordered the organisers to produce the inspection report of the fire department before him on Tuesday.        
	A resident had filed a petition claiming that the puja organisers were violating norms. She also alleged that police did not take action against the organisers despite her complaint. On August 20, the judge had restrained the organisers from continuing work on the pandal and directed the fire services to inspect it. We are still hopeful of organising the puja, said Tapas Sengupta, a spokesperson for the club.

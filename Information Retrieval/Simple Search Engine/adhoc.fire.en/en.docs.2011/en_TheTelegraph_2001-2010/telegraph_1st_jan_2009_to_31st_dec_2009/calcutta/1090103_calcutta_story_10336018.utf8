	Park Street Carnival, a part of The Great Kolkata Shopping Festival presented by Anandabazar Patrika, was off to a flying start on Friday with a touch of art and music magic.         
	The three-day carnival is one of events that will Celebrate Park Street, a year-long initiative to rejuvenate the drawing room of the city.        
	Police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti inaugurated the art camp on the Apeejay House lawn. Sumit Roy and his band later belted out original compositions.        
	Works produced by the 12 artists who are taking part in the three-day camp will be sold at The Park on Sunday. The proceeds will be used to fund the rejuvenation project.        
	We are working on the streets beautification and we aim to re-brand Park Street as the citys cultural hub, said architect Monica Khosla Bhargava of the Society for Park Street Rejuvenation, a group of professionals who have come together to drive the initiative.        
	The opening night saw musical performances at Allen Park. Tourism minister Manabendra Mukhopadhyay promised financial and infrastructure support to the initiative.        
	US consul general Beth Payne, who also attended the event, called it a fabulous effort and promised to help as an individual.        
	Usha Uthup performed Fever, the first song she had sung at Trincas in the 1960s, bringing a smile to the face of Flintstones band member Steven Booth, who had accompanied her on drums.        
	Performances by Hip Pocket, Louis Banks and Don Saigal and Band followed.         
	The next couple of days of the carnival will see a design seminar, youth forum, music concerts and a street performance.

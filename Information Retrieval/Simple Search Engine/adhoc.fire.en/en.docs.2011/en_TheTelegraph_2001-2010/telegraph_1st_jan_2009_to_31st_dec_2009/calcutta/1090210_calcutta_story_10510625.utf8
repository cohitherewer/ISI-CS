                More than 300 trainees of an IT firm in Sector V went on the rampage inside their office on Monday after their salary cheques bounced and they discovered that senior officials had not visited the office since last week. They later filed a general diary with the Sector V police outpost, accusing the management of embezzling funds. The trainees alleged they were recruited through campus interviews in September 2008 on a monthly salary of Rs 7,000. They alleged they hadnt been paid anything since their induction. They also complained that the company had taken a deposit of Rs 50,000 from each.    Deepak Mullick, 24, died early on Monday after being hit by his elder brother, Ranjit, 29. Police said the two were fighting over sharing meat between the two families. Ranjit pushed Deepak and he fell to the ground and became unconscious. He was taken to MR Bangur Hospital, where he was declared dead. Ranjit is absconding since the incident.    The BSF seized 600 Indian tent turtles at Bongaon, off the Bangladesh border, on Monday. The endangered turtles were to be smuggled to Bangladesh, said officials of the state forest department. A departmental probe has been launched but no one has been arrested. The turtles have been brought to the Animal Rescue Centre of the Wildlife Wing headquarters at Bikash Bhavan in Salt Lake. Five turtles were found dead.    Traffic on NSC Bose Road was disrupted for nearly an hour from 11 am on Monday after residents of Regent Park put up a blockade demanding regular supply of drinking water. The blockade was lifted after police assured them of regular supply within a short period. Local Trinamul councillor Prahlad Chakraborty said the residents were facing problems because of the repair of a 1.4-lakh gallon reservoir, which was built in 1973. The reservoir is scheduled to be opened on Tuesday, he added.    Four people were injured in two accidents in the city late on Sunday. Around 10.30pm, a truck dashed a duo on a motorcycle in front of Rabindra Bharati University. Akash Hela, 18, and Rajesh Shaw, 30, sustained head and hand injuries and were admitted to RG Kar hospital. The truck driver was arrested. Around 11pm, Rabin Kanojia, 18, and R. Balam, 22, were injured after their motorcycle skidded on the AJC Bose Road flyover. They were taken to SSKM Hospital.     Residents of Jagannathpur in Mahestala, on the southern fringes of the city, discovered a mortar shell near a health centre in the area on Monday. The one-and-half-ft-long shell was noticed by Ranibala Mondal, who informed police. The cops said the shell was made in 1993, probably in a defence factory in the country. They are trying to ascertain how the shell got there.    Sheikh Dulara, 24, a pavement dweller on Tiljala Road, was severely beaten up by passengers of a private bus at Ballygunge on the suspicion that he had stolen a cellphone from one of the passengers on Monday. Passengers dragged him out of the bus and thrashed him. A police team arrived on the spot and sent Dulara to Sambhunath Pandit Hospital. An officer of Ballygunge police station said Dulara was injured in the head and chest.    Yasim Khan, 32, a resident of Birbhum, lodged a police complaint on Monday after his pocket was picked of Rs 5,000 at SSKM Hospital. Police said Khan, a daily labourer, had borrowed the money for the treatment of his 10-year-old daughter, who was admitted in the hospitals cardiology unit with a hole in her heart. No one was arrested in this connection till late on Monday.

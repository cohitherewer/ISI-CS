                                                                                                               Lawyer murder in taxi 
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Barun De                                  
	An Alipore court lawyer who had been missing since May 8 was murdered in a shared taxi and dumped by a roadside bush, police said.        
	The body, found on May 9, was identified on Monday.        
	Barun De, 38, had taken the taxi from Taratala around 10.30pm on May 8 on his way home to Budge Budge from Kasba. The lawyers acquaintance Kartik Rajbanshi, who had led him to the taxi, and two men who were in the vehicle were arrested on Sunday.        
	Baruns wife Kalyani, a schoolteacher, lodged missing diaries with Kasba and Budge Budge police stations on May 9. The woman has a six-year-old son.        
	With no trace of Barun, his colleagues moved the additional chief judicial magistrate on Saturday. The judge ordered the police to submit a report on the case within three days.        
	The next day, the three suspects were held. They have been remanded in police custody for seven days. Three other suspects, including the taxi driver, are absconding. The criminal investigation department has taken over the probe.        
	The superintendent of South 24-Parganas police, Ajey Ranade, said Rajbanshi knew that De went to his chamber in Kasba from the court every evening and returned home via Taratala at night.        
	Sleuths said Rajbanshi had planned to rob Barun on May 8. Rajbanshi joined the lawyer when he reached Taratala and guided him into a shared taxi. The driver and four others were already seated in the vehicle.        
	Rajbanshi himself did not get into the taxi. When the group reached Mollargate, a passenger got off. Soon after, the criminals on board asked De to hand over valuables. When the lawyer hesitated, the criminals strangulated him and snatched a gold chain, a gold ring, a cellphone and about Rs 1,500 before dumping the body, said an officer.        
	Rajbanshi told us that the robbers had killed Barun because he had seen their faces. The taxi driver, too, was part of the gang, added the officer.

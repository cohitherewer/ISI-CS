	Jewellery worth about Rs 6 lakh was stolen from a puja pandal and a temple in the city early on Tuesday.        
	A gang is suspected to have raided the pandal of Mansatala Sangsad Club in Kidderpore between 3.30am and 5am and decamped with jewellery adorning the idols.         
	Gold necklaces and nose rings on the idols of Durga and Saraswati and worth over Rs 80,000 were stolen. It seems to be the work of a local gang, said Nemai Kumar Das, a member of the club, which has been organising the puja for 63 years.         
	The theft was detected around 5am by a woman who visited the pandal to offer puja and found a part of an earring lying on the platform on which the idols were kept.        
	We were in the pandal till 3.30am. The gang must have come after that, said Das.         
	A complaint was lodged with Watgunge police station. We have picked up some local hoodlums. It seems to be a planned theft, said an investigating officer. In the other incident, gold jewellery worth Rs 5 lakh were stolen from a temple in a house in Durga Charan Doctor Lane in Taltala.         
	According to the police, Tapan, the priest of the Krishna temple, claimed that he had handed over the keys to the premises to Sanatan, the caretaker, two days ago.        
	We are questioning Tapan and Sanatan as they have given contradictory statements, said an officer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Return of urge to splurge
                                                                                                               Return of urge to splurge
  - Sales soar across sectors as Dhanteras boosts market after year of downturn despair        OUR BUREAU                          Raveena Tandon was back in one of her favourite cities on Friday, for a string of Kali puja inaugurations. It was tough to leave my two kids on Diwali-eve, but the festive buzz in Calcutta was amazing, smiled the Bollywood beauty at a Salt Lake puja late on Friday.

	The feel-good factor has made a strong comeback this Dhanteras-Diwali with downturn-spooked Calcutta rediscovering the urge to splurge and the market going flat out to cash in on the festive feel.        
	From gold to gizmos and coins to cars, everything flew off the showrooms as the city invoked the goddess of prosperity by throwing austerity to the wind in a burst of shopping that picked up speed as the week progressed and peaked on Dhanteras.         
	I would say this is the best day the market has had in more than a year. Its too early to call it a retail resurgence, but trade volumes have increased by 25-30 per cent over the week across sectors, said a city-based retailer who did not wish to be named.        
	As the city switched from budget-bound to no-holds-barred buy-buy mode, Metro went around town to feel the pulse of the market and compile a Dhanteras report card.        
	JEWELLERY: 25%         
	Jewellery chain Nemichand Bamalwa amp; Sons recorded 25-30 per cent more sales in the Dhanteras-Diwali week than the same period last year. Demand was high for both gold and diamond jewellery.         
	According to a representative, most of the purchases were in the Rs 50,000-Rs 2 lakh bracket. We have had a good festive season so far with our customers returning, said Bachraj Bamalwa.        
	At Sawansukha Jewellers, the customer profile ranged between those seeking a small something priced around Rs 5,000 to those with deeper pockets. We have had a 15-18 per cent increase in volumes over last year, said Sidharth Sawansukha.        
	Bittu Arora, shopping for jewellery for her daughter, summed up the buyer sentiment by saying that gold prices hitting record highs was not a deterrent. We buy some gold every year because its an occasion to buy.        
	SILVER: 30%         
	The silver coin was back as the favoured gift item. Bhatters, a popular silver shop stop, had a footfall of 1,000-plus on Thursday, despite the rise in the price of silver. In terms of cash in the box, it was 15-20 per cent more than last year, said Abhishek Bhatter.        
	Another popular store, Gold Silver Arts, recorded 30 per cent more footfall than last year and a 40 per cent increase in business, said owner Sanjiv Kejriwal.        
	Sachin Bhawsinghka, spotted shopping for silver with wife Sweta, said they had purchased more than planned.        
	Businessman Sushil Mohta, who had curtailed his Dhanteras-Diwali shopping last year, was also at a store shopping for silver knick-knacks to gift family members and business associates. The price of silver will increase; so its not a bad time to buy the metal, he smiled.        
	ELECTRONICS: 45%         
	Never-before festive deals in household appliances ranging from televisions to toasters were the flavour of the buy-buy week, and the city responded to the offers with a festive frenzy.        
	Cams Corner, one of the largest retailers, recorded a 100 per cent growth in footfall over last years festive period. High-definition LCD televisions were the rage of the week, pushing sales up by around 40 to 50 per cent at Cams, said Jiten Chawla.        
	At eZone, sale of LCDs doubled over last year with washing machines, microwaves and cameras the other popular picks, said Sandeep Marwaha of Future Group.        
	Homemaker Ruchi Jodhanis family had postponed replacing their old television for quite some time but finally decided to buy a new one on Dhanteras. Its a very auspicious day for purchasing, and we decided to bring the television of our choice home on Thursday, she said, checking out different brands.        
	CARS: 30%         
	The festive spirit revved up car sales across all segments after a dull year when several manufacturers launched new models in a futile bid to beat the downturn blues.         
	Mukesh Hyundais VIP Road showroom delivered 58 cars on Dhanteras and recorded 54 bookings.         
	Mohan Motors, the Maruti dealer on AJC Bose Road, rolled out 75 cars and received 64 bookings. Alto was our pop pick, driving 40 per cent of our sales, said a spokesperson for the showroom.        
	Dewars Garage, the Maruti dealer on Council House Street, also handed over 57 cars to their new owners on Thursday.        
	Chevrolet dealer Dhulichand Motors, on the EM Bypass, delivered 23 cars and took 22 bookings. Lexus Motors, the Tata Motors showroom on AJC Bose Road, sold 45 cars on Thursday.         
	Pinnacle Honda, on the EM Bypass, also did great business with 60 car deliveries in a single day, said a spokesperson.              
	PLUS, THE MOVIES        
	If the Friday footfalls at the plexes were anything to go by, then catching a Bollywood release is now as much a part of the Dhanteras-Diwali week as shopping and eating out.         
	We came in for some last-minute Diwali shopping, but then decided to watch Blue. For us, watching a film is as much a part of Diwali festivities as shopping and eating out, said homemaker Priyanka Bagaria, spotted at Fame in South City.

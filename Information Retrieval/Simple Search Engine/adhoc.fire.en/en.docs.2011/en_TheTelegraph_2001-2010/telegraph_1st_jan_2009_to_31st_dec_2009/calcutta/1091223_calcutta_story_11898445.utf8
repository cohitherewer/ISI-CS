	The chief minister on Tuesday assured the Government College of Art and Craft of help to set up a second campus to accommodate more students at the masters level.        
	Im disturbed to know that the college is finding it difficult to accommodate more students at the masters level because of a lack of space. The college deserves another campus in a proper environment and I am ready to take the responsibility of making the required arrangements, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said at the inauguration of Parampara, the institutes 145th annual art exhibition.        
	The chief ministers announcement comes a month after the college formally requested him to arrange for land for expanding its campus. We have requested the chief minister to grant us five acres in Baruipur where we can open a campus for the masters course, said Dipali Bhattacharya, the officer-in-charge of Government College of Art and Craft. The chief minister has asked the college authorities to meet him after Christmas to discuss the issue.         
	He urged the college to organise such exhibitions in Durgapur, Siliguri and the Calcutta Information Centre, saying: We will make all necessary arrangements for such shows.

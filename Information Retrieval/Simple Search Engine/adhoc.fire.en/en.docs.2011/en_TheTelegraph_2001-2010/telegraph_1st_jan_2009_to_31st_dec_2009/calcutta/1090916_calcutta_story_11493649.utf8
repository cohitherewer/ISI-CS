                      Ceramic creations                    Abandoning a career in commercial communication for a more soul-fulfilling occupation, Aditi Saraogi was first exposed to clay as a medium of artistic expression through a studio potter in Calcutta. Her keen interest in learning pottery took her to several places in India and abroad, where she honed her skills under the able guidance of well-known masters of the craft. Her learning experiences had a profound impact on the artists philosophy  simplicity of life; her works find her embracing life in all its beauty, contrary to the jaded and complicated life in the city. The artist is greatly influenced by nature in its myriad forms. Movement and dance find expression everywhere in her creations, as she attempts to convey through them the spontaneous vigour, vitality and dynamism of life in its archetypal elements. Her works also appear to make music. The ancient technique of smoke-firing accentuates this impression, with the accompanying dancing flames celebrating the vivid colours of life. The ongoing exhibition of ceramic art works by Saraogi is a one-of-a-kind show featuring functional and aesthetically brilliant pieces, with each work of art bearing testimony to her unique, special relationship with clay.                  Event: An exhibition of ceramic art by Aditi Saraogi When: Till September 16; 10 am - 7 pm Where: Weavers Studio Centre for the Arts, 94 Ballygunge Place

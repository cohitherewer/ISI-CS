The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Concrete block sags on Metro route
                                                                                                               Concrete block sags on Metro route

	A 25ft long block of the concrete base of overhead Metro Railway tracks near Rajpur-Sonarpur municipality is being demolished after it sagged on Saturday night, twisting and snapping iron girders that were holding it in place.        
	Workers at the site noticed the sagging on Saturday night and ran away, said residents of the area. Sunday being a holiday, the Metro Railway extension work was suspended. On Monday, employees of the municipality alerted the Metro Railway authorities about the block on the verge of collapse.        
	Senior engineers visited the site on Tuesday afternoon and ordered demolition and reconstruction of the block, next to the proposed New Garia station. The private agency that cast the portion will bear the cost.        
	N. Jain, the chief engineer of Metro Railway, said: There is no reason to be worried. Some stress problems caused the sagging. The block will be demolished because we dont compromise on security.        
	Residents, however, are jittery. Big chunks of concrete were falling to the ground on Saturday night. The block along with the pillars could easily have collapsed, said Asim Patra, who lives in the area.        
	According to Metro Railway sources, recasting of the concrete block will delay the extension work by a month and a half.        
	The project has already been delayed because of problems in land acquisition. The issues were sorted out in a meeting presided over by transport minister Subhas Chakraborty on February 6.        
	Shifting the municipality office was another problem. After the meeting, municipality chairman Kamal Ganguly had said the office would be moved after the district land acquisition authority of South 24-Parganas acquired an alternative plot.

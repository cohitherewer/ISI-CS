	Ishika Gupta (name changed on request) was driving home from a friends house in New Town around 7.30pm. On the approach to Salt Lake from Action Area I, the 26-year-old saw in the rear-view mirror four youths tailing her on two motorcycles. As they drew close, the four started passing lewd remarks and making obscene gestures at her. A frightened Ishika pressed on the accelerator; so did the bikers. The gang kept following her till the Wipro crossing in Sector V, where they turned around and sped off seeing Ishika pull over next to a police jeep.  
	I could well have been physically assaulted. I thought of lodging a complaint but that would have led to quite a few hassles. I have resolved not to visit New Town again after dark, Gupta told Metro.              
	What Ishika went through was not an isolated incident in New Town. A threatening law-and-order situation is one of the many problems plaguing Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees showpiece township.              
	Problem: Rajarhat roads, dark and dangerous by night, are a nightmare for residents, especially women.        
	With shanties and illicit liquor dens, frequented by outsiders, mushrooming in the 3,779-acre dream township, the law-and-order situation is worsening by the day.        
	After sundown, car headlights are the sole source of outdoor illumination. Residents complained of many incidents of snatching and teasing over the past few months.        
	The lone police station, with its 30-odd personnel, is hardly a deterrent to criminals.              
	Residentspeak: Cable TV and broadband connections are frequently interrupted because of cable theft. Last November, a rickshaw-puller was beaten up by three men when he caught them stealing cables, said homemaker Anamika Dasgupta, 34.        
	Deepak Sen, 56, a trader, said: There have been numerous instances of petty theft in Action Areas I and II. After dark, men in groups drink and smoke marijuana in the open. Women cant think of stepping out after sunset.        
	Rabindranath Das, a 34-year-old techie, recalled that two of his colleagues, on their way out of New Town on a rickshaw in the evening, were subjected to a verbal assault by a bunch of goons barely 200 metres from the police station.        
	Lax security forced Mala Rai Chowdhury, 49, an employee of a private school, to shift to Nagerbazar after staying in Rajarhat for a fortnight. During my stay in New Town, three of my neighbours were robbed. One afternoon, a motorcyclist snatched a cellphone from a teenaged girl in front of my housing estate.              
	Officialspeak: Hidco officials who are developing the township pleaded helplessness, blaming the deteriorating law-and-order situation to lack of enough cops.        
	As more residents move in, more police stations will be set up and the streets will be regularly patrolled. For now, its difficult to keep an eye on the entire township. But the situation is not as bad as the residents allege. Why dont victims lodge police complaints? If there are specific complaints, the police will certainly address them, said a Hidco official.        
	What can we do if people dont want to take the trouble of lodging a complaint? The inhabited as well as the uninhabited stretches of New Town are monitored regularly. Private guards look after the residential estates, said an officer of New Town police station, located in Action Area I.

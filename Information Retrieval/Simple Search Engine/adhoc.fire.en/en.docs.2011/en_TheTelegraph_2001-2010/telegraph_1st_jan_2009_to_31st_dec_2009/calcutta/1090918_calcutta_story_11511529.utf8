The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Zip, zap, zoom rally returns to town
                                                                                                               Zip, zap, zoom rally returns to town
  - 560.2km Calcutta leg to roar over the weekend and revive interest in motor sports          ANASUYA BASU                                                  
	The city may be moving in slow motion, but a zip, zap, zoom rally is roaring back to town after a gap of nine years.        
	The SPEED Indian National Rally Championship (INRC) 2009, partnered by t2, hits this part of the world for some serious off-roading over the weekend.        
	Conducted under the aegis of the Federation of Motor Sports Clubs of India, the national rally is heading east for the third leg of the championship after completing Coimbatore and Bangalore.        
	The rally that will ride some tricky terrains in Durgapur, is aimed at regenerating interest and enthusiasm in motor sports in general and speed rallying in particular. We have been able to bring the rally to Calcutta after a gap of nine years through competitive bidding, said Arindam Ghosh of Ramakrishna Race Performance Management, hosts of the September 18 to 20 rally.        
	Calcutta has Time Speed Distance (TSD) rallies, but speed rally is a different ball game altogether because of the cost factor, said Somdeb Chanda, a rally enthusiast and Assistant Clerk of Course for the three-day rally. Lack of awareness and sponsors saw the death of speed rallies in Calcutta. But with the INRC here after almost a decade, there should be more takers for the sport now.         
	The eastern leg, christened Rally de Kolkata, will pit Team MRF, that swept all three top positions in the Bangalore leg, against Calcutta boy Amittrajit Ghosh of the Red Rooster Racing team which also has defending champion Vikram Mathias as co-driver.        
	The Calcutta leg, covering a distance of 560.2km, will consist of two special stages at Durgapur and the Super Special Stage (SSS) at the Jadavpur stadium in Santoshpur where motor sports enthusiasts will get to watch the thrills and spills  table jump, water spot, tight corners, fast corners, dips, and, yes, the champagne shower ceremony.        
	Amittrajit, placed third in the championship with 13 points, did a recce of the tracks on Thursday. The monsoon has washed away many of the tracks and repair work is on. By tomorrow, the tracks should be ready.... I will go all out to win this leg, he told Metro, from his 2000cc Mitsubishi Cedia that delivers 220 horse power.

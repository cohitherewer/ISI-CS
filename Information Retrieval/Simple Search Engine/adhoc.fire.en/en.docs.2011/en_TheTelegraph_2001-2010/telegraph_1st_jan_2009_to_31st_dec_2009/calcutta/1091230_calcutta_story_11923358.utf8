                      A peep into the world of a forgotten artist        Color is my day-long obsession, joy and torment.|  Jackson Pollock  Indira Debi (1909 - 1950) was like the meteor whose   short but promising life ended in ashes more than   half-a-century ago. But despite her conscious effort   to remain anonymous, her works speak for her, loud  ly, long after she left this world. An ardent art student,   she took her first art lessons from nuns at Loreto   Convent Shillong. Abanindranath Tagore detected   the spark in the young girls sketches and encour  aged her to pursue her calling, i.e, art. Soon she   began taking watercolour lessons from Kshitin  dranath Majumdar, a prominent member of the Ben  gal School. She also learnt portrait painting from Atul   Bose. Indira Debi was deeply influenced by the mass   movements against the British that erupted in vari  ous parts of the country during her youth. She   worked prolifically between the years 1936-43 and did   nearly a hundred watercolours, oils, charcoal draw  ings and pencil sketches. Despite being an important   artist of her time, she preferred to keep her works anonymous and hence most of them do not bear her signature or date. The   current exhibition of 70 watercolours, 33 oil paintings and 12 pieces in other media, has been painstakingly compiled from pri  vate collections.

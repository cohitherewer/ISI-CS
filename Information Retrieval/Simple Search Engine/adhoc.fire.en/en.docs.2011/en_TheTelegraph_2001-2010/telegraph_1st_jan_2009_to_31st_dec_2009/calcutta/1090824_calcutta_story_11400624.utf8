                      Hideous side of humanity                    Theatrecian presents Nin9 [Point] Blanks maiden production, F, a dark and twisted modern-day reinterpretation of an age-old Faustian legend. Drawing influences from Andrew Neidermans The Devils Advocate, Guillermo del Toros Pans Labyrinth, John Miltons Paradise Lost, Christopher Marlowes Dr Faustus and Rolling Stones Sympathy for the Devil, and everything else that we have ever seen, the play narrates a tale that deals with morality, faith, greed, lust, vanity, pride, love, deception, religion, satanism, wrath, envy and mans never-ending quest to become more than himself. Through its staging, theatre lovers can witness the celebration of destruction, the evolution of human monstrosity and the satiation of mans base, temporal desires. A bilingual production in English and Hindi, this one-and-half hour play is written and directed by Aamil Keyaan Khan and Vikram Agarwal.                    Event: Play in English amp; Hindi, F, produced by Nin9 [Point] Blank When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Gyan Manch

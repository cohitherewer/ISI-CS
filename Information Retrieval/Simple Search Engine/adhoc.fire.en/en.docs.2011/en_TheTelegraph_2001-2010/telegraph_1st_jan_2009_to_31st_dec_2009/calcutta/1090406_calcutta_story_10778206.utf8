                                                                                                               Candidate record on SMS 
  - Programme to help voters make informed choices          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	The state arm of an initiative to make voters aware of the backgrounds of candidates in their constituencies will be launched in Calcutta on Monday.        
	Criminal records, assets, liabilities and educational qualifications of the candidates will be available online at www.adrindia.org.         
	The information will also be conveyed to those who dial 1-800-110-440, the toll-free National Election Helpline.                
	The campaign, National Election Watch, has been undertaken by the NGO, Association of Democratic Reforms (ADR). It was founded in August 1999 by professors from the Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ahmedabad, and the National Institute of Design and alumni of IIM with the aim to strengthen democracy and governance in India by focusing on fair and transparent elections.        
	The election watch is an initiative to educate the electorate and put an end to criminalisation of politics and unethical poll practices. We want people to know their candidates and make an informed choices, said Deepika Kedia, the state co-ordinator of ADR.        
	The organisation has been monitoring general and assembly elections since 2003. It goes through affidavits of candidates across the country and provides their criminal and financial profile to the electorate.        
	Helping people to elect candidates with the cleanest criminal and financial records is our top priority. We want people to choose the right candidate and not vote if the candidates are not of their liking by informing the polling officer in their booth, added Kedia.        
	If 10-15 per cent voters in a constituency exercise the right to not vote, the chief election commissioner can order parties to field new candidates.        
	The affidavits are checked by returning officers at the constituencies and then sent to the chief electoral officer (CEO). The CEO hands over a CD with the affidavits of the candidates in the state to the ADR after the last date of withdrawal of nominations.        
	This year, we will check the affidavits with the help of 1,200 associated NGOs across India. The information will be made available within two days of the CEO handing over the CD to us. In Bengal, the information will be available after April 20, said Kedia.        
	The ADR is doing a good job in educating the electorate. Its a brilliant effort by a civil society organisation. They have conducted many workshops in the past where even the chief election commissioner of India has participated, said CEO Debashis Sen, who will launch the Bengal chapter of the campaign.

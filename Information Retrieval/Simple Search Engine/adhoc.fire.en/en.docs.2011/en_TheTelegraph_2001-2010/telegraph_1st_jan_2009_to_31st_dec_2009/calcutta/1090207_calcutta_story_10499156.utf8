                      Cinema on human rights                    Continuing its efforts in expanding the visual platform for human rights issues from the global South, Breakthrough and Swayam present the ongoing 5th Tri Continental Film Festival. Being screened as part of the festival are films that explore violence, exploitation, destitution, apathy, as well as the internal turmoil of real people who are at the core of these films. This years selection of 14 films from all over the world gives its protagonists a voice that will surely resonate with circumstances at home. Filmmakers have negotiated and successfully handled questions about representation and form in non-fiction, giving dignity and respect to their varied characters. Providing balance and courageously putting the stories in public domain, they have explored different film genres, from investigative to fictional narratives. Art forms like performance, photography, dance and popular culture have also been used to encourage questions and reflections around social change. To be screened today: The American (3 pm), Ironeaters (4.15 pm), Pray the Devil Back to Hell (5.50 pm), Under Construction (7.15 pm) and Up The Yangtze (picture here; 7.25 pm).

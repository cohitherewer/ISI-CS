                                                                                                               From average girl to US top job

	Manju Ganeriwala describes herself as an average girl from an average family. But few take her word for it as the former resident of Shivaji Park in Mumbai holds a key administrative post in a US state.         
	Manju, born in Akola, Maharashtra, and brought up in a conservative Marwari household, was sworn in as the treasurer of Virginia in January. In Calcutta for a felicitation organised by the Seth Jugaldas Ganeriwala Charitable Trust, the 52-year-old with two sons spoke about her ascent to the top job.        
	I was in the final year of BCom at Poddar College when my grandparents and grand uncle broached the topic of my marriage. They said I did not know whats good for me but they did. My mother, who had entered the room to serve tea, protested. She had studied till the sixth standard before being married off to a household where women never stood up to elders and borne six children but did not think twice about insisting that I finish college first, recounted Manju.        
	The other turning point in her life came after she had completed her graduation, married and moved to the US with husband Surendra Suri.        
	He quit his job to pursue a PhD. I also wanted to do an MBA but friends and family members insisted that one of us should work to support the other. My husband, however, told me that I should take a student loan and study with him. This gave me an immense sense of empowerment, said Manju.        
	After getting her degree, she worked in the private sector for a couple of years before her elder son Rakesh was born. We had moved to Richmond, which being a small place and a state capital offered only government jobs. After taking a year off, I secured a job as a financial analyst in the department of planning and budget. I did not have long-term plans but the job gave me a 30,000ft view of how each decision can affect governments and citizens. Unlike the private sector, the bottomline did not determine everything, she said.        
	Before she was sworn in as the treasurer in January, Manju was the deputy secretary of finance in governor Timothy M. Kaines cabinet. She was the key adviser to the governor on financial matters, including the crafting of the biennial state budget.        
	Her advice to students is to be authentic. You have to be passionate about your work. If a task is too daunting, focus on the small next step and not the hill that lies in front, she said.

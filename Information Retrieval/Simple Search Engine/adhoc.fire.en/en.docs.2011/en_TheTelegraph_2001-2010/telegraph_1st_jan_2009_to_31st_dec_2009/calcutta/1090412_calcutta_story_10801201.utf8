The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Advice from a patriarch
                                                                                                               Advice from a patriarch
          
	It is not often that the RPG Enterprise patriarch R.P. Goenka is spotted at a book event in town. But he was there at Oxford Bookstore to do the honours for Nirmalya Kumar and Pradipta K. Mohapatras new title Indias Global Powerhouses published by Tata Mc Graw Hill. Buying books and not reading them is my habit, he confessed. If he had read 10 per cent of the books he had bought I would have been a good pundit by now, he added. But then for him to purchase is half the pleasure. R.P.G. would visit Oxford Bookstore in his college days. It was a pleasure to be at this bookstore then. After passing out of college I was too busy with work and didnt have the time to come this way. I visited the bookstore after 20 years last year and I found the standard had really fallen, he said. But he found it okay now, which drew a collective sigh of relief from the store staff.         
	Author Nirmalya Kumar, a professor of marketing and co-director of the Aditya Birla India Centre at London Business School, said: The book profiles Indias pioneering multinationals in detail, describing their transformation from leading domestic players to evolving global giants. R.P.G.s advise to the bookstore: Why dont you open accounts for booklovers, who can then buy books even if they are not carrying the money now?         
	A glam poet                  Shomshuklla at the launch. (Rashbehari Das)       
	A refrain in Calcutta today is that the young generation speaks and writes English more than Bengali. The complaint was heard again at the launch of Seconds before Sunrise, a book of poems by Shomshuklla, at Starmark, South City. Though a book launch in a plush bookstore is not the place where a glam poet should be reprimanded by a Bengali literary heavyweight for choosing to write in English, one would think. Shankars gentle critique was followed by Buddhadeb Guhas gaffe about her being a painter. But any form of writing from a person with the responsibilities of family life is commendable, he added.         
	It was good that the attractive Shomshuklla, a singer-cum-writer-cum-theatre person, in a blue sari and a backless top, proceeded to read out her poems. One of them, called Refreshment, went thus:         
	Dark green/ Light green/ Parrot green/ Sunlight green/ Cloudy green/ Leaves, leaves  
	Soft twig/ Green twig/ Brown twig/ Hard twig/ Twigs, twigs  
	 Twigs and leaves,/ Leaves and twigs,/ Refreshment.  
	Is it a description of a sari?       MALINI BANERJEE

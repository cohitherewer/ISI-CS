	Mumtaz Khatoon had to drop out of school three years ago because of financial problems when she was in Class VIII. But now, the hawkers daughter is back to her books, thanks to Snegam.         
	She is one of 350 children under Snegam Social Welfare and Resource Society, a five-year-old NGO that provides education to underprivileged children from five to 14 years of age. We want to reduce the number of school dropouts. To ensure that the child does not drop out again, student volunteers from our college counsel both the parents and the kids, said Felix Raj, the principal of St Xaviers College and founder-president of Snegam.         
	The NGO celebrated its Founders Day at St Xaviers Primary School in August.         
	Snegam has two centres in Tamil Nadu and five in West Bengal. Three of them are located in South 24-Parganas and two at Kidderpore and Entally. Classes are held four hours a day, five days a week.         
	The NGO also takes in students who have never been to school. Many are also sent to mainstream schools and trained in co-curricular activities like drawing, drama and dance.

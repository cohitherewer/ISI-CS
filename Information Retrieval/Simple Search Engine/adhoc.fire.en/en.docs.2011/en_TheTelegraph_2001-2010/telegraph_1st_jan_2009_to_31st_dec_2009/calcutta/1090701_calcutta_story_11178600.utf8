The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Parents block road against fee hike 
                                                                                                               Parents block road against fee hike 
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Parents of students of St Augustine Day School blocked AJC Bose Road, near the Nonapukur tram depot, for an hour on Tuesday morning, protesting the proposed fee hike. The blockade held up traffic on several arteries.        
	Over 100 parents gathered at the crossing, near the former venue of the junior section, around 11am to protest the schools decision to hike the monthly fees by Rs 500 to Rs 700. The school had sent a notice on June 29 regarding the fee hike, citing the increase in staff salary. The blockade was lifted after police intervened.        
	We want the school to revoke the fee hike as it is unnecessary, said a parent of a Class VII student. According to the parents, the school has poor infrastructure.        
	Students of lower kindergarten to Class V were shifted to the basement of a building on Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road, said a parent who has one daughter in the junior section and another in the senior school. The senior school is located on Ripon Street.        
	The school has promised to set up a building housing both the junior and senior sections but the parents said there were no indications that the shift would happen soon.        
	The school charges Rs 1,100 for the new building in addition to Rs 5,000 for every new admission. But there is no new building, said a parent.        
	The parents have demanded withdrawal of the notice and said they would not pay more fees till the kids were shifted to the new building. They have also demanded that the junior section be moved into a proper building.        
	The toilets are dirty, there is no drinking water, proper classroom or ventilation, said a parent.        
	Principal C.R. Gasper said the decision to raise the fees was not yet final. We have only issued a notice informing the guardians that we need to increase the fees of the students of kindergarten to Class II as we have to implement enhanced pay scales for our teachers as recommended by the fifth pay panel, he said.        
	I was shocked with the way a section of the guardians staged a protest without informing us that they had problems in paying the enhanced fees. We are ready to discuss the issue with them, the principal added.        
	We had to shift the junior classes as the old building was being renovated. A new building is being constructed on AJC Bose Road. The renovation will be over soon and the new building is also expected to be ready within a few months, said Gasper.

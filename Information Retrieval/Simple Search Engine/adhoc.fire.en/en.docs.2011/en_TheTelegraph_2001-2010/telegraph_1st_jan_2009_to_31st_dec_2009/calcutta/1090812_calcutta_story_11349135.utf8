                                                                                                               Schools at Biman door
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	State-aided Christian missionary schools deferred their plan to recruit teachers on their own following an assurance from CPM state secretary Biman Bose on Tuesday.        
	The founder bodies of the schools had threatened to start the recruitment drive from August 31 if the government kept holding back permission for filling up vacant posts.        
	The Christian groups deferred the deadline to September 15 after meeting Bose at the CPM state headquarters on Alimuddin Street.        
	Weve extended the deadline to September 15 after Bose assured us that he would soon arrange a meeting between us and the school education and minority affairs departments, said Herod Mullick, of the state association of minority educational institutions.        
	Now that the CPM state secretary has given us an assurance that our problem will be solved, we will not take any hasty decision, said a member of the delegation that called on Bose.         
	CPM sources, however, said Bose would not comment on the outcome of the meeting.        
	The Christian groups alleged that around 1,200 teaching posts in 300-odd aided schools  including Scottish Church, St Lawrence and Holy Child  had fallen vacant since the government stopped okaying recruitment three years ago. Since the schools run on state grant, its mandatory for them to obtain governments permission before recruiting employees.         
	The schools had earlier claimed that the National Council for Minority Educational Institutions would help them ensure that the state paid the salaries of the teachers recruited without state approval.        
	The delegation that met Bose also included representatives of Muslim and Sikh communities.

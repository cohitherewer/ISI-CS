The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | To school? Dont forget mask
                                                                                                               To school? Dont forget mask

	When 11-year-old Rohan Datta organised his school bag on Thursday night, he made sure he had put in the latest addition to his uniform  a face mask.        
	The Class V student of Apeejay School was among hundreds of youngsters, ranging from age five to 18, who trooped into the Park Street campus on Friday morning, faces covered in anti-pollution masks.        
	It is part of our school uniform now. It will protect us from the pollution that is killing the children of Calcutta, said Rohan, his words muffled through the mask.        
	If Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee  or his transport minister Subhas Chakraborty  had crossed 115 Park Street at 7.45am on Friday, they would have been greeted by a shameful sight  students entering school in blue-and-white uniform, with a yellow mask covering mouth and nose.        
	The anti-pollution mask has been made a part of the uniform from this academic session by Apeejay School  at both its Park Street and Salt Lake addresses  in a bid to safeguard the health of its students and boost attendance.        
	We realised that a lot of our students had health problems that kept them away from school. Watery eyes, blocked noses or breathing problems, it all stems from pollution and we realised that we needed to do something to help ourselves, said the principal and administrator, Reeta Chatterjee.        
	After a session last month with environment activist Mudar Patherya on the threat posed to children by vehicular pollution, a group of students walked into the principals office and suggested that the mask be made a part of the school uniform.        
	A mail circulated to the students and their parents about using the anti-pollution mask as protection got immediate response from both students and parents.        
	Pollution is a huge problem. Wearing it just to school might not help combat the effects of pollution but it is a step in the right direction, said Surojit Bose, the father of Souvik, a student of Class VII.        
	The school had announced April 20 as the day from which the mask becomes compulsory but many children  and teachers  chose not to wait till Monday.        
	If only I had spent Rs 10 on the mask earlier I would not have had to spend Rs 52 on each medicine I am taking for a lung infection, said Indu Sharma Simon, a Hindi techer of the school.        
	Despite the discomfort of wearing a mask on a hot and humid Friday, the students wore it like a badge of honour. It is a little uncomfortable. But a little discomfort is no issue when it ensures better health. The mask shows the solidarity of the school in standing up for a cleaner Calcutta when the decision makers are not taking any action, said Alimpan Banerjee, the head boy of the school.        
	It is about making a statement without making too much noise. The mask protects us, creates awareness and also sends a message to everyone that we have taken the matter of our health into our own hands, added Ayan Ghosh, the schools maths teacher.        
	Metro has been running a clean-air campaign for years but the government has done nothing to save a choking city. Will the masked movement of teens, tweens and tots on the citys most popular street finally shame M/S Bhattacharjee, Chakraborty amp; Co. into action?

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fair address of snarls
                                                                                                               Fair address of snarls
          JULIUS GOMES                                                
	The area around Milan Mela, the only permanent fairground in Calcutta, is a study in traffic chaos.        
	Car crawls and snarls that span hours are common on the Park Circus connector when a fair is on at the 4,400sq m complex, developed by the state government for an initial investment of about Rs 48 crore, near the busy Parama Investigation Centre rotary on the EM Bypass.        
	Vehicles bound for and coming from the airport, Salt Lake, Park Circus, central Calcutta, Garia and Rashbehari Avenue pass the rotary. Convoys of VIPs take the route, holding up traffic. Traffic disruptions last as long as five hours.        
	Metro tried to reach the fairground from the heart of the city on a Sunday evening and found traffic on the Park Circus connector in a mess. It took over half an hour to reach the rotary. A journey down the connector took less than 10 minutes before Milan Mela came up.        
	On weekdays, about 1.5 lakh vehicles cross the stretch. The figure jumps to over 80,000 on an average weekend. A big fair pushes up the vehicle count even higher.        
	Everyone is aware that this is a serious problem, but there is not much we can do. We are not involved in any discussion to sort out the matter, said K. Harirajan, the additional commissioner (traffic).        
	This is definitely not a suitable location for a fairground and the state government should address the problems it is causing, said A.K. Jain, a 46-year-old electrical goods trader from Ranikuthi who took part in the recent Industrial India Trade Fair.        
	I had taken the EM Bypass, via the Park Circus connector, to get to Milan Mela. The journey takes ages since the stretch is always chock-a-block with traffic, he added.        
	Only about 400 cars can park in the complex, which is inadequate for the Book Fair. The two entrances create bottlenecks, causing snarls. The third gate is reserved for VIPs.        
	Vehicles heading for Milan Mela from the EM Bypass have to drive past the venue and then take a U-turn, holding up vehicles on both sides of the connector, to gain access to the complex.        
	Not only did I get stuck in traffic on my way to Milan Mela, I also had problems entering the venue because of the long queue of cars outside the gates, said N. Sirdar, a 52-year-old trader from Park Circus who participated in the industrial fair.        
	The 16 traffic policemen and six regular cops who manned the stretch during the fair were stretched beyond their limits.        
	People going to the airport or Salt Lake from south Calcutta often get caught in snarls outside Milan Mela, said an official. The complexs proximity to the Parama rotary is a major problem. That Science City, Calcutta Boating and Hotel Resort and ITC The Sonar, Calcutta are a stones throw away further complicates matters.        
	There is a proposal to build an elevated corridor from Dhapa to Park Circus over Parama rotary and the Park Circus connector awaiting the approval of the central sanctioning committee of the ministry of urban development, said the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) chief engineer, Ananda Ganguly.        
	Once the project materialises, most of the traffic problems in the area will be solved, he added.         
	The proposal was sent to Delhi in October and is being scrutinised. In a bid to ease traffic flow, the CMDA has reduced the size of the Parama rotary and opened a service road near Science City to vehicles moving from south to central Calcutta via the EM Bypass.        
	There is no scope to widen the stretch of the road, however, said officials.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cops blind to bus bay misuse 
                                                                                                               Cops blind to bus bay misuse 
                                      A private bus speeds along the Sealdah flyover   avoiding the empty bus bay             Taxis occupy a bus lane   at the northern end of   CR Avenue             A state bus moves   down the middle of Rashbehari Avenue with parked vehicles eating into the bay       
	Calcutta police created bus bays on 80 major thoroughfares to prevent buses from racing, ensure safety of passengers and allow smooth passage for other vehicles. Two years later, the bays serve as parking zones for taxis and goods vehicles as buses speed outside, picking up and dropping passengers in the middle of the road.         
	A bus driver who does not use a bay can be booked under Section 119 or 177 of the Motor Vehicles Act and fined Rs 100 but cops seldom pull up those violating the norms.         
	Metro runs a reality check on bus bays on three vital stretches.              
	Sealdah-Moulali        
	There is a bus bay of around 100 metres from the NRS Hospital main gate to Sealdah footbridge. There are also bus bays on Sealdah flyover.        
	The traffic chaos in the area will be minimised if buses ply along the bays, but few drivers follow the norm in the peak hours. As a result, traffic snarls are common on the stretch.         
	The drivers alone cannot be blamed for violation of the bus bay rule. Policemen often fail to keep the corridors clear. Bus drivers are allowed to slow down unnecessarily in the bays, without attracting penalty.        
	Passenger voice: The absence of policing has defeated the purpose of creating bus bays. Buses often race outside the bay, said Sadhan Mahapatra, who commutes from Bagbazar to Moulali regularly.              
	CR Avenue        
	There are several bus bays on the artery, including outside Medical College and Hospital and at Sovabazar and Girish Park.        
	The buses do not pick up passengers from the bays and often use the rest of the carriageway to overtake other buses.        
	Trucks load and unload goods at roadside stores, blocking the bay throughout the day.         
	At Sovabazar, Girish Park and the entrance of Medical College and Hospital, taxis are often parked in the bus bays.        
	Passenger voice: The buses do not ply through the bays and force us to get down in the middle of the road, said Chandan Ghoshal, whose relative was admitted to the hospital.              
	Rashbehari Avenue-Gariahat        
	The bus bays on this stretch were created to minimise accidents, especially near the Gariahat crossing. The autorickshaw stands at the intersection were shifted to allow buses to ply along the bays. Lanes for buses were also painted on the Gariahat flyover but few drivers follow the norms.        
	The autos have returned to the crossing, choking traffic. Parking is allowed on a large part of Rashbehari Avenue, which provides drivers the excuse to avoid the bus bays.        
	Passenger voice: The buses will ply along the bays only if the cops are strict. The faulty planning of the bus bays has reduced the road space and caused traffic congestion, said Tanmoy Chattopadhyay, who drives down to his Dalhousie office from his Kasba residence.        
	Police version        
	We regularly penalise drivers who violate the bus bay norms. Officers are deputed to note the registration numbers of buses that ply outside the bays and force them to ply along the channels to ensure smooth traffic flow, said Samir Kumar De, the deputy commissioner of traffic (II).        
	A senior traffic department officer, however, said cops struggled to man the traffic as well as keep an eye on buses plying outside bays.

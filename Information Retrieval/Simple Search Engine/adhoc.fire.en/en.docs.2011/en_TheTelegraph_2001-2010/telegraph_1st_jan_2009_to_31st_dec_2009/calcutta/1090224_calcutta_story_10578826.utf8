                                                                                                               AA score for nervous 90s in Madhyamik
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                      
	Madhyamik examinees will be assessed through grades from this year in an attempt to reduce exam-related stress on the students. The examination begins on Wednesday and will continue till March 7.        
	The marksheets, like the ones issued to Higher Secondary candidates, will show both marks and grades scored in each subject but will not mention the division or total marks.        
	The new method of evaluation will reduce exam-related stress on students and also make teaching and learning more enjoyable, said Mamata Ray, the president of the state secondary education board.        
	The grades, divided on a seven-point scale, will be AA, A+, A, B+, B, C and D. Those scoring between 90 and 100 per cent marks will be awarded AA.        
	The lowest grade  D  will be given to those who score less than 25 per cent .        
	Students will have to score at least 25 per cent  Grade C  in all seven subjects to pass the examination.        
	Those who will get D in one or two subjects will have to clear the papers in the subsequent year. But candidates scoring D in three or more subjects will have to write all the papers again next year.        
	In the earlier system, students were required to score at least 20 per cent in individual subjects and 34 in each of the three groups to clear Madhyamik.        
	The introduction of the grades is part of the governments attempt to overhaul the school education system following recommendations of the National Council of Scientific Education and Research.         
	The Higher Secondary council has been awarding grades to its examinees since 2007.        
	Around 8,55,000 students will appear in Madhyamik 2009.        
	Ray said more girls would take the exam this year compared with the last. Around 3,45,396 girls have enrolled against 2,90,720 in 2008.        
	The test will start at noon and the students will have to enter the examination hall by 11.45am. They will be allowed 15 minutes to read the question paper before they start writing the answers.        
	There is good news for Hindi-speaking students as the board has decided to set question papers in life science and physical science in Hindi. Till last year, the students who wrote answers in Hindi had to follow the English version of the question papers in these two subjects.

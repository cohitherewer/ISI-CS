The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Trees damage power lines
                                                                                                               Trees damage power lines
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Monday left the city battered and bruised and powerless too. Electricity supply was disrupted in many parts of Calcutta and its suburbs as uprooted trees fell on overhead wires, snapping connections.        
	In some areas like Panchashayar in Garia, electric posts were felled by the storm.         
	Our engineers are working to restore services and we hope to resume normal supply by Tuesday morning, said Dilip Sen, the executive director of CESC.         
	Officials said in many areas, power was switched off around noon as overhead wires started swinging dangerously. Power was restored in some areas after 4pm, when the wind speed decreased.        
	However, large stretches of Salt Lake, Lake Town, Bangur, Maniktala, APC Road, Behala, Kasba, Southern Avenue, Golf Green and Jadavpur suffered long power cuts.         
	Lake Town faced load shedding from 11am. There was a strong gust of wind, following which the power went off. We later learnt that a tree had fallen on a transformer somewhere, said Krishna Roy, a resident of B block.         
	At Arvind Tower on APC Road, 56 flats went without electricity till 8pm after a banyan tree near the main gate brought down all the overhead wires.         
	CESC officials did not allegedly bother to fix the problem. We have been making frantic calls to the CESC office but they are hanging up saying all their workers are out for repair work, said Debabrata Roy of Creek Row.        
	Some areas went without water too. Parts of Bansdroni, Naktala, Netaji Nagar, Baishnabghata-Patuli and Garia did not receive drinking water on Monday evening after the Bansdroni booster pumping station suffered a power cut.

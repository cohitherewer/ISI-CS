The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A celebration of kitsch
                                                                                                               A celebration of kitsch
										      Flashback                        Sheetalnathjis temple as it is today and (below) its photograph taken by an unknown GI in 1947, now in the collection of Pennsylvania State University. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta				                                       
	Kitsch could not have found a better temple. Sheetalnathjis temple in a quiet lane off Raja Dinendra Street in Maniktala is a celebration of all that Calcuttas very own form of hybrid architecture stands for. It is ornate, brash and shiny, even vulgar, with no respect for either purity or good taste, and has a lot in common with the puja pandals that mushroom all over the city and its outskirts using the worship of Durga as an excuse.        
	The Jain temple, surrounded by other temples of this religion, stands in a quiet offshoot of the busy street close to Gouribari. It is a more extreme example of the ornate style common in the stately homes of north Calcutta. The principal shikhara or spire of the main temple towers above the crenellated walls. A surprisingly spic-and-span lane between the outer boundaries of two temples leads to the impressive gateway of Sheetalnathjis temple. Lions stand guard on either side on top of the portal. A plaque on the gate reads: Shree Sheetalnathji. Temple and garden founded by Rai Budree Das Bahadur, Mukim to HE (His Excellency), The Viceroy, 1867.         
	Next to it is a woman with golden hair on a giant tile. She wears a pleated two-tiered gown holding a flaming torch and standing amid the moon and stars. Hundreds of people visit the temple every day.        
	The garden inside and the temple seem to have been planned by artists for whom nothing is in excess, and for whom nothing is taboo. Save the portions with greenery, even the floors of the garden are intricately mosaiced with flower patterns. It looks as if the floor is carpeted in blue and green.         
	Glittering adornments, fantastic forms, grotesques and flowering creepers were lavished to such an extravagant degree that the eyes of the visitor will glance from one detail to the other without hope of getting any relief. The artists and architects who conceived this place of worship did not spare the garden as well. They had appropriated both Western and indigenous styles and planted statuettes and fountains all over.        
	Waterfowl cling to the fountains, one of them growing out of a giant lotus with crazy mosaic petals spread all around like a giantesss skirt. European ladies and goddesses in flowing skirts who must have held gas lamps at one time stand next to women in Rajasthani garb. There is a tank on the right hand side of the main gateway and these European figures encircle it.         
	At one time, schools of golden carp used to swim around the pond, bobbing up whenever visitors chucked food into the water. Now there are none.        
	To the left of the temple is a single-storey building crowned with floral patterns in stucco. In the midst of this tiara is a mammoth star flanked by the images of fish. The paint work on the building  in the most lurid combinations of pink, mauve, green and yellow  is still fresh. This is where guests are received.        
	The actual temple is single-storeyed and is flanked by two elephants and their mahouts sitting astride. In front of it is a marble statue of the founder of the temple mentioned in the plaque. His hands are folded in a namaste. It was erected in 1910. Most of the coloured glass used for the mosaic on the shikharas has disappeared, leaving behind scars.         
	A short flight of marble stairs leads to the shrine and each and every inch of the temple walls is covered with glass tiles and pieces of winking mirror that catch the eye like flashguns going pop. Visitors can see their doubles in the strips of mirror on the walls along the corridor.         
	In the middle of the temple is a giant chandelier. Smaller ones in red and green hang elsewhere within the precinct of the temple. The dome above which the shikhar soars is encircled by innumerable dancing figures of men and women in dull gold. Running along the ceiling are miniature paintings. An employee of the temple showed me the eternal flame that has been burning since the foundation of the temple in 1867.        
	Inside the sanctum sanctorum is the marble image of Sheetalnath Swami, the 10 tirthankara. Its gate bears the images of 48 deities. The temple is run by a private trust, the trustees of which are descendants of Rai Budree Das Bahadur, who was jeweller to the viceroy. The employee took me to a house adjoining the temple to meet Arun Kumar Singh Mookim, a 63-year-old man, who is one of the two trustees and great grandson of the founder. Their entire clan of 60 lives here. Their original house at 152 Harrison Road was sold during their great-grandfathers time.        
	The courtyard of the house is a huge carpet of crazy china partly gouged out. Wrought iron chairs and benches with vine leaf motifs and handles shaped like the head of dogs are laid out in front of the house. Arun Singh says restoration of the temple is a continuous, time-consuming and costly process met through donations and collection from the box. The main shikhar will be repaired later.        
	Artisans who are trained in the craft of restoring mosaic are as rare as the raw material used. About 10 of them work all the year round. Most of them belong to a Muslim family from Nawada in Bihar, the other two are Bengalis. Coloured glass used for the mosaic is a rare commodity. So they have to keep a look-out for old houses that are being demolished. For 1sq ft they often have to pay as much as Rs 150-200.       SOUMITRA DAS

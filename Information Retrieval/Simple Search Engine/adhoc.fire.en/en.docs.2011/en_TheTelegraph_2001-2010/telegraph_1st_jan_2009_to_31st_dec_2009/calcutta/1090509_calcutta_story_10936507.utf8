The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Body exhumed
                                                                                                               Body exhumed
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A Howrah couple have been accused by neighbours of killing their third girl child, prompting the police to exhume the three-day-olds body.        
	Residents of Naskarpara informed the police on Friday morning that Pradip Gupta, who runs a cycle repair shop, and wife Rekha had killed the child because they already have two daughters. The couple also have a son.        
	When the neighbours forced into the Guptas house and inquired about the baby, Rekha told them that the child died after birth. But the neighbours refused to believe them.         
	Later, Rekha and Pradip told the police that they had buried the baby in the courtyard of their house. A preliminary probe suggests there was no foul play. The body has been sent for post-mortem, said an officer of Liluah police station.

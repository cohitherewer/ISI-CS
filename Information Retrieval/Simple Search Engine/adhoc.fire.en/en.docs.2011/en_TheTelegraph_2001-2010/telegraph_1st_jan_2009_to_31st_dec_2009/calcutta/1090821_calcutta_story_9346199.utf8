The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cops turn to Interpol in monkey theft case
                                                                                                               Cops turn to Interpol in monkey theft case
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Police have contacted Interpol in an attempt to track down the eight Common Marmosets that were stolen from Alipore zoo on August 9.        
	The cops also announced a cash award of Rs 50,000 for anyone providing information leading to the recovery of the rare monkeys.        
	The Interpol will get in touch with the police of various countries and get a list of individuals dealing with such animals. They will also inquire whether there has been any recent purchase of marmosets, police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti said on Thursday.        
	The top cop during the day inspected the zoo with chief secretary Ashok Mohan Chakrabarti, home secretary Ardhendu Sen and other senior officials.        
	Chakrabarti denied there had been any delay in contacting the Interpol. We had alerted all airports in the country soon after the theft. Now we have contacted the Interpol. I dont think there has been any delay.        
	Some zoo officials, however, feel there is hardly any chance of recovering the marmosets if they had already been smuggled out of the country.        
	The police commissioner admitted the security system of the zoo had not been fool-proof. Cops, he added, would remain posted on the zoo premises even after the authorities hired a new security agency. The contract of the earlier agency was terminated after the theft.        
	The forest department has submitted a report on the zoos security. Action will be taken on the basis of the report within two to three days, the chief secretary said.        
	As part of the beef-up, night vision cameras will be installed on the premises and all cages covered with wire mesh fitted with alarms. The number of guards will be increased, the chief secretary added.         
	Zoo director Raju Das said the authorities were considering appointing a security officer.        
	Sleuths said the two guards who were arrested in connection with the theft could not give any useful information.

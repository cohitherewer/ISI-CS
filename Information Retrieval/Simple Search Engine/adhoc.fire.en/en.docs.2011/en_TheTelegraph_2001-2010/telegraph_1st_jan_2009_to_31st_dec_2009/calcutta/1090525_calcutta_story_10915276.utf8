The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Power utility tips for CMC 
                                                                                                               Power utility tips for CMC 
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	The civic body has sought CESCs help to prepare a status report on the power supply situation at its water works and booster and drainage pumping stations.        
	The decision was taken following power disruptions at the Auckland Square and Raja Subodh Mullick Square booster stations that resulted in water crisis in the two areas. A 12-member panel, comprising seven engineers from CESC and five from the CMC, has been formed to review the power supply situation at the facilities.        
	If the committee so suggests, we will overhaul the supply lines to the booster and drainage pumping stations, said civic commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.        
	Though the CMC has its own electrical department, we decided to take CESCs help as the utility has modern testing gadgets, said chief engineer (electrical) Pradip Jyoti Biswas.         
	Maintaining a steady supply of water in summer and draining out accumulated water during the monsoon are among our key concerns. To tackle both jobs, we have to ensure proper power supply to the booster and drainage pumping stations, the commissioner said.        
	More than 14 booster stations spread across the city pockets are the main stay of the CMCs water supply network. Its an integrated system and disruption in power supply to one station may affect the network.         
	Similarly, the drainage grid comprises 22 stations, all linked to one another.

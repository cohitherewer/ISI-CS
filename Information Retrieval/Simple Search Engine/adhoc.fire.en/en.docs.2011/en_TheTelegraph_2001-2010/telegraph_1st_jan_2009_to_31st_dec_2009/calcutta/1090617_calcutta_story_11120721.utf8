	A business-cum-pleasure trip to Scotland ended abruptly for a Salt Lake couple when a relative called to say that the house they had left in the care of a security agency was burgled.        
	Alok Chakraborty, the dean of business management at Techno India, and wife Gitali returned from Glasgow on Tuesday to find their single-storey rented house at BD 87, in Sector II, ransacked and items worth lakhs missing.        
	They took away everything that was worth taking  my wifes jewellery and precious stones, six-seven gold watches, silver idols, showpieces, antique coins from my collection, cellphones, iPods, a laptop....Were still counting our losses, said Chakraborty, of the tech and MBA campus in Salt Lake.        
	The couple had left for Scotland on May 15 after hiring the services of JK Security, based in Salt Lake, and obtaining a magisterial protection order under Section 144 of the CrPC. We are fighting a court battle with the owner of the house, which is why we obtained that order, explained Chakraborty, who had an official assignments to complete in Scotland.        
	Gitali had accompanied her husband to meet their son Dipto, who is based in Glasgow.        
	A team from Bidhannagar North police station arrested Bablu Bag, one of the guards employed with JK Security, in the evening. He and a colleague were interrogated earlier in the day.        
	Gitalis elder sister Chaitali Bhattacharyya, who stays in HB block of Salt Lake, was the first to be informed by JK Security about the burglary.         
	Someone from the agency contacted me on June 11 and said my sisters house had been robbed. When I asked whether the police had been told, he said that was not his job. How can the agency shirk responsibility after charging Rs 15,000? she complained.        
	The security agency refused comment.        
	The thieves got in through the rear of the house. They broke open the lock on the collapsible gate and used a stool to send one person in through the ventilator. The rest was easy. What the guards were doing is something we need to probe, said an officer.        
	The gang prised open two steel almirahs that contained Rs 8,000-10,000, jewellery, watches and antique coins. They also took away four cellphones, a laptop, a music system, two iPods, a portable TV, clothes, shoes and perfumes.

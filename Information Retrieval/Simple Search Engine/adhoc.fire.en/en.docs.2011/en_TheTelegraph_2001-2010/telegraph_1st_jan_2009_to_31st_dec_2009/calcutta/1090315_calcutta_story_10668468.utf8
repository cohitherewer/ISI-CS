The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A private eye on India
                                                                                                               A private eye on India
										      EYEWITNESS                              A photo from Private and (above) a work by Balaji Ponna				                           
	Private is a leading international magazine on the art of photography published from Italy.         
	Its winter 2008-2009 issue is devoted to photography in India. Edited by Suvendu Chatterjee of Drik India agency, it has black-and-white photographs by 16 practitioners, all born after 1959.         
	Titled Private 43 Other Side India, it highlights various issues and problems that afflict the sub-continent. Troubled Kashmir lends itself to Zishaan Akbar Latif and Faheem Qadris stark portrayal. Srinivas Kurugantis and Sucheta Dass focus are on the woes of the coal miners of Bihar and the arsenic victims of Bengal, respectively.         
	The tribals of Bastar and their esoteric rituals come to life in Manoj Kumar Jains visuals. Ayodhya is not in the epicentre of violence any longer, and Prashant Panjiar portrays life after the Babri Masjid demolition.         
	Saibal Das and Kushal Ray objectively document life in a circus and in a joint family with a matriarch, respectively. Prabuddha Dasgupta and Bijoy Chowdhury record life in Goa and the bandwallahs, respectively, with touching candour.         
	The abysmal state of rural healthcare and the horrors of girl running (albeit with a touch of the theatre) are revealed in the works of Nilayan Dutta and Shantanu Mukherjee. Gauri Gills urban landscapes are depeopled and shorn of identity. And for real slumdogs, nothing to beat Sudharak Olwe. Each photographers statement and CV are included in this superbly produced and printed number.              
	Patriotism and nationalism are sentiments looked upon with suspicion today. Balaji Ponnas exhibition titled Black-Smoke at Bose Pacia looks askance at current trends to glorify India as a nation without any flaws through his largish canvases in which he uses familiar motifs and strategies  mostly maps  to perpetuate Indias image in a certain manner in popular media.         
	Balaji is from Andhra Pradesh, and he exploits cartography to create maps of India on which are scrawled slogans that are usually raised by politicians and jingoists to pander to popular sentiments, and ultimately rouse the rabble. But that is just the larger picture. For these are meticulously painted canvases, and the details reveal the real picture.         
	Countless landless peasants crowd around the surface in one. In another the flag of India is like a huge carpet being rolled out of existence by people of often conflicting faiths. The icons of great Indians are lost behind a layer of soot. Balaji makes subtle use of textual and visual puns to drive home his point. The imagery in these paintings is richly varied. He does make use of popular strategies as an attention-getting tactic but through this he explores the meaning of nationalism.       SOUMITRA DAS

                Arijit Sen, 50, a former finance manager with a private banks New Alipore branch, was arrested on Tuesday on the charge of cheating several customers of Rs 45 lakh. A probe revealed that Sen had convinced several account holders to invest in term deposit schemes. But instead of depositing the money in the bank, he had siphoned it off. The fraud was discovered during an inquiry by the bank last month. Sen was fired on November 5.     A mob ransacked the office of the stationmaster, a ticket counter and two other rooms at Bargachhia station in Howrah to protest delayed running of trains on the Howrah-Amta line. Government Railway Police sources said passengers became angry after waiting for an Amta-bound local for 30 minutes. Police brought the situation under control. No one was arrested.    Munna Singh, 53, was injured in the leg when a taxi hit his bike at the Strand Road-Fairlie Place crossing on Monday night. Singh, a resident of Bellilious Road in Howrah, was taken to SSKM Hospital and later shifted to Kothari Medical Centre. The taxi driver was detained.

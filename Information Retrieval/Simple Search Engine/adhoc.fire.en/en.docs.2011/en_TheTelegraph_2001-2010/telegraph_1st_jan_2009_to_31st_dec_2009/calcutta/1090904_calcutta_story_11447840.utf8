          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two constables caught a youth who had allegedly snatched a gold necklace from a woman after chasing him for 20 minutes through crowded streets in north Calcutta on Wednesday evening.        
	Kasim Lashkar, 24, took away the necklace of Bedbati Roy, a 51-year-old Sovabazar resident, while she was waiting for a bus at the intersection of Vivekananda Road and Bidhan Sarani around 7pm, said police.         
	Witnesses said pedestrians started running after the snatcher when the woman raised an alarm. The two constables, Ashok Singh and Naresh Kumar, who were part of a police patrol team passing Bidhan Sarani, also started running after the youth.        
	Noticing cops behind him, Lashkar crossed the road and entered a lane. After a 20-minute chase, he was caught at Hedua, said Faiyaz Ahmed Khan, the officer-in-charge of Girish Park police station. The necklace was in Lashkars trouser pocket.         
	Lashkar, a resident of Canning in South 24-Parganas, was produced in Bankshall Court on Thursday and remanded in police custody.

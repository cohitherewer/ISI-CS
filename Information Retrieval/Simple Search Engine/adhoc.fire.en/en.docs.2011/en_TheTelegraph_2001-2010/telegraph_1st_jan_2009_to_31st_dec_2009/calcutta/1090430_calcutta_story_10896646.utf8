The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Water crisis after mains breach
                                                                                                               Water crisis after mains breach
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	At least 20,000 household taps in Behala remained dry on Wednesday following a breach in the water mains.        
	The breach was caused when a labourer mistakenly hit the pipe while digging Raja Rammohan Roy Road in Panchanantala to lay sewer lines.        
	Water supply in several areas was affected as the booster pumping station had to be temporarily shut down, said an official. Civic engineers took up repairs around 11am but could not seal the breach till Wednesday night.         
	The engineers blamed the delay on the narrow roads in Behala.        
	nTownship complaint: In Salt Lake, a former councillor of ward 20 met the chairman of Bidhannagar Municipality to highlight water shortage in various parts of the township.        
	Clusters of Purbachal apartments are not getting adequate water from tank No. 13. Water from the tank is being diverted to IA block, alleged Minu Chakraborty, the former Trinamul Congress councillor.        
	We are forced to buy water, said Anjan Sanyal, the secretary of the Purbachal Cluster-XI Cooperative Housing Society. There is no water crisis in the township. I will still send my engineers to Purbachal, said civic chairman Biswajiban Majumder.

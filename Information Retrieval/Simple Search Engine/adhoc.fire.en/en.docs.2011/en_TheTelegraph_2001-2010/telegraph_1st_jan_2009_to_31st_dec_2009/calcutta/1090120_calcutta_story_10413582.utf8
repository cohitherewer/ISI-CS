                                                                                                               NSG hub outside city
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The state government on Monday asked two senior officers of the National Security Guard (NSG) to visit Kalaikunda in West Midnapore and Panagarh in Burdwan to identify 1,200 acres for a commando hub.         
	The Union home ministry had said the plot for the NSG hub must be close to the city airport. State home secretary Ardhendu Sen, after a meeting at Writers Buildings on Monday, said: As we have failed to identify any 1,200-acre plot near the airport, we offered NSG officers the option of finding such land near the airforce bases at Kalaikunda or Panagarh. Chhatra in Purulia is another option.        
	Chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti chaired the meeting, which was attended by land and land reforms commissioner Barbir Ram and the district magistrates of West Midnapore, Burdwan and North and South 24-Parganas.

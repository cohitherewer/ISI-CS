The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Kids as Congress monkeys
                                                                                                               Kids as Congress monkeys
  - Tail-tale violation of child rights          A STAFF REPORTER                          Children dressed to look like monkeys take part in a Congress-backed protest at Alipore zoo on Tuesday over the theft of eight Common Marmosets. Picture by Amit Datta                                        
	Slum kids Ladla, Azad and Deepak had a day out at the zoo on Tuesday  not to see monkeys but to mimic them in front of political ringmasters whose hearts bleed more for stolen marmosets than exploited children.        
	The trio  aged between 10 and 12  were picked up from a Kidderpore slum and taken to Alipore zoo around 2pm dressed in monkey suits with their faces painted, hair smeared grey and tails strapped to their waists.         
	They are the mascots of our protest against mismanagement of the zoo, said a member of the Congress-affiliated Alipore Zoological Gardens Employees Association.        
	Former mayor Subrata Mukherjee, who led the monkey parade, didnt think it amounted to a violation of childrens rights punishable under Section 23 of the Juvenile Justice Act of 2000.         
	It is not a very important issue. The kids were used only to highlight our concern over the security breach that allowed a gang of thieves to steal eight Common Marmosets, he told Metro.        
	Ten-year-old Ladla, the son of a driver, said he and his two friends were promised money to buy sweets in return for masquerading as monkeys for a couple of hours. We were asked to scratch our bodies and make noises like monkeys do. I didnt know this would be so tough, he said, sweating in the brown suit.        
	The kids were given a placard each, one of which asked: Why are we inside when the management committee is outside?        
	Deepak, the oldest of the trio at 12, mildly protested on being pushed into the room where the management committee of the zoo was meeting to discuss Sundays theft. But those who had hired his services for the afternoon were in no mood to listen.        
	Ghorer bhitore ja aar bandor-er moton kor (enter the room and act like a monkey), ordered one of the union members.        
	After the boys in monkey suits were shooed out, it was the turn of those without tails to monkey around in the room.        
	The officer-in-charge of Watgunge police station, Tenzing Bhutia, reached the zoo around 5.30pm but remained a silent spectator to the exploitation of the three slum children.        
	The law empowers the officer-in-charge of a police station to take suo motu action against anyone found exploiting a child.        
	Bhutia declined comment on the violation. All I can say is that this representation (by the union) wasnt scheduled.        
	Congress leader Pradip Ghosh, a former mayoral council member of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, appeared perturbed, though not over the exploitation of children. Animals must be protected, he shouted. Unfortunately, this managing committee that is full of CPM members has made a hash of security at the zoo.         
	Ghosh might need reminding that there are also laws to protect children and send offenders to jail.         
	The Juvenile Justice Act states that whoever assaults, abandons, exposes or wilfully neglects a child or subjects him/her to assault, abandonment or neglect in a manner likely to cause mental or physical suffering is liable for imprisonment up to six months, or fine, or both, said Sarfaraz Ahmed Khan, a professor of law at the National University of Juridical Sciences.         
	The parents of the three children paraded as monkeys allegedly knew that their wards had been hired for a political circus, but none of them was available for comment.         
	The three kids dont attend school regularly but are learning to read and write under a literacy campaign by an NGO.        
	Tuesdays circus was the second at the zoo in as many days. Congress and Trinamul supporters had descended on the zoo on Monday with loudspeakers, shouting slogans and insulting officials.         
	The Congress brigade also came armed with huge posters of Manmohan Singh, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi that were put up at strategic locations.

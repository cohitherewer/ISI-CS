	Two young couples from Lord Sinha Road go partying every Saturday night. Park Street-Camac Street is their happy hunting ground. Last weekend, the gang of four was pleasantly surprised to find the lights on at the Adidas outlet on Shakespeare Sarani after 10.30pm. Out of curiosity they stepped in, and ended up buying stuff in the sheer excitement of night shopping.        
	So, how do retail racks beat the downturn blues? Staying open after-hours and offering a late-night shopping window to the citys buy-buy brigade could be one way out.        
	The Adidas outlet on Shakespeare Sarani has decided to swim against the age-old tide of downing shutters at 9, by doing business till 11pm, seven days a week.        
	 In todays stretched scenario, one has to constantly reinvent to stay afloat, and late-night shopping could be just what the doctor ordered for the failing health of Calcuttas high-street retail, says Kamal Jain, the Adidas franchisee who took the night plunge with the nod of the German sportswear major. The Adidas experiment is up and running, with the store reporting a 25 per cent jump in sales, less than a month from flag-off.        
	Parking, a major roadblock for most high-street stores, isnt a problem after 9pm, boosting drive-ins. Besides, there are quite a few hotels and nightclubs in the vicinity, fuelling footfall, says Jain.        
	Brands like Benetton and Levis, with large-format outlets next to the Adidas store, could follow suit and create a cluster of late-night shopping in a happening stretch of town. If we can collectively drum up enough excitement along that corridor through night shopping, fast-food kiosks and coffee bars, it sure can work, feels K.K. Roy of Levi Strauss India Ltd.        
	That would work just fine for Priya Sen, who works with a German HR firm in the vicinity. After-office, hassle-free shopping on a weekday would not only change the way I shop but also allow me to do so many other things over the weekend, she smiles.                                
	The impulse that the gang of four party-hoppers felt last Saturday night after stepping into the Adidas address is what holds the key to the success of the night bazaar.        
	Shops staying open at night would lead to impulse buying, since the mindset of consumers is more geared towards that at that late hour, feels Abhijit Das, the joint managing director of retail and property consultants Lemongrass Advisors.        
	A clutch of high-profile shop-stops have had to down shutters of late, and for the citys battered high-street retail fraternity, the late-night format could be a lifeline. It could be the definitive differentiator for high-street retail, since malls are hamstrung by water-tight hours and complicated logistics, points out Madhusudan Binani, who owns the Allen Solly and Louise Phillipe showrooms on Shakespeare Sarani.        
	Today, theres no such thing as a nine-to-five job. For them, late hours makes perfect sense and with Pujas early this year, this is perhaps the right time to start, adds Vijay Dugar of CS Trade Link, who runs the Levis outlet on Shakespeare Sarani.        
	Paridhi Agrawal, 26, is already making night shopping plans. The best time to go shopping is before I go pubbing. Plus, its one time when your man can actually accompany you willingly. So, it seems a win-win for both buyers and sellers, she smiles.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Burglary off CM house
                                                                                                               Burglary off CM house
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The entrance (in red circle) to the burgled house, within a few feet of the permanent police picket. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                  
	A gang broke into a two-storeyed house on Palm Avenue, within 100 metres of the chief ministers residence and a few feet of a police outpost, and ransacked all rooms late on Wednesday.        
	Police are not sure which items the gang had taken away because the residents of 81 Palm Avenue  Pratap Guha, 53, and wife Arati, 45  were in Bangalore.        
	The couple have been informed about the burglary and are likely to return in a day or two. Till they arrive, we cannot ascertain the worth of the items looted, said an officer of Karaya police station.        
	Seven constables and an assistant sub-inspector, posted barely 10 feet away from the house for Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees security, were apparently in the dark about the burglary.        
	The break-in came to light around 8am on Thursday when the couples domestic help, Kajal Das, turned up. Seeing the main door and all the rooms open, she raised an alarm which alerted the policemen nearby.        
	The cops said the gang had scaled the boundary wall and broke open the window grille to enter the house. They broke the locks of all six rooms and opened four almirahs. The help and the cops found garments and other valuables strewn around.        
	Fortunately, I had deposited all my jewellery in the bank locker before leaving for Bangalore. We had kept some cash in one almirah, Arati told Metro over the phone.        
	We are feeling unsafe in the Palm Avenue area. Despite being a high security neighbourhood, there have been several cases of theft, said Arati.        
	Kamal Patra, the officer-in-charge of Karaya police station, said a couple of local goons had been detained. We are also questioning our men who were on duty in the locality, said a senior officer.

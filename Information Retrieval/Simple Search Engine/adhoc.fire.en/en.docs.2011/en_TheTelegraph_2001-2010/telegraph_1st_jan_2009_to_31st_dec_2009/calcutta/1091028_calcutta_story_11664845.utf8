The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 15kg tumour cut out of abdomen
                                                                                                               15kg tumour cut out of abdomen
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 15kg tumour that was growing in a mans abdomen for nearly a year has been removed at a private hospital in the city.         
	Monir Alam, a 55-year-old technician with the defence ministry, had gone for a check-up a couple of months back because his stomach was becoming inflated and he was feeling uncomfortable.        
	A CT Scan revealed that a tumour was growing upwards, downwards and to the left in the Santoshpur residents abdomen. He was admitted to Calcutta Medical Research Institute (CMRI), where he underwent the surgery.        
	Such a large tumour is very rare and could have proved fatal if it was allowed to grow for some more time, said surgical gastroenterologist Sanjay De Bakshi, who led the team of doctors and support staff that removed the tumour after a six-hour surgery on October 20.        
	Alam has recovered and will soon be discharged from the hospital.         
	According to doctors, the tumour was pressing the organs on the right side of Alams body. His right kidney, appendix, right side of the large intestine, small intestine and the main aorta were pressed to the left. The pressure could have seriously damaged the organs, said De Bakshi.

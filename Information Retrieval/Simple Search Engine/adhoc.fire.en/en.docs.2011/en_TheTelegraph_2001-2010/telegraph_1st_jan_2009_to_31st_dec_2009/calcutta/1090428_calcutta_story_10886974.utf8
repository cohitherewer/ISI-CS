The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Heat hurdle on campaign trail
                                                                                                               Heat hurdle on campaign trail
										      ONTHESPOT - ELECTIONEERING IN SUMMER                        A rally in support of Sujan Chakrabarty at Kasba. Pictures by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya				                                 
	The summers have always been distressing for those engaged in outdoor work. But this year, the elections have been a great leveller. Pedestrians have been joined in their plight by political leaders and their supporters, who are out in the sizzling sun to canvass for votes from door to door.         
	Incidences of sun burn, heat stroke, diarrhoea and dehydration are on the rise among the political rank and file as the poll fever matches the mercury level.         
	A good number of party workers are suffering from eye ailments and headaches after exposure to the unrelenting glare of the sun.         
	To keep their workers fighting fit, parties are stocking up on glucose, caps and sunglasses, which are being distributed free among supporters. Booths are being set up to dispense glucose water to supporters during mid-day rallies.         
	Political activist Sujit Mukherjee in Chetla said: It is really very tough for us to campaign in the scorching sun. Last week, I fell ill after prolonged exposure to the midday sun. As a result of dehydration, my body temperature shot up above 102 degree Fahrenheit. The doctor advised me to take rest and avoid the sun. But that is not possible now.        
	No matter how hot it gets, party workers cannot afford to stay indoors as their political future is at stake.        
	We are party whole-timers and earn an honorarium every month. Hence, the party is our primary concern, particularly when elections are round the corner. But we are taking precautions so that we dont fall ill, said CPM activist Atanu Guha, who is the former secretary of the Jadavpur party committee.                  CPM candidate Rabin Deb at Garden Reach      
	Some are toiling in the sun not for money but love. We are not paid to campaign; our loyalty to our party is spontaneous. The heat is distressing for everybody but in our party, field workers can express their inconvenience without fear since the Trinamul is a peoples party. Our party activists are not soldiers but social workers, said Firhad Hakim, a Trinamul leader from south Calcutta.        
	The only ones reaping the benefit of the situation are chemists and druggists. The sale of glucose and oral rehydration solutions (ORS) have hit an election high. Soft drink vendors and coconut sellers are also cashing in.        
	Gautam Bardhan of Blue Print, a medical store chain, said: Thanks to the election, the market for ORS and glucose solutions has registered an unusual upswing.        
	According to Bardhan, there has been a four-fold increase in the demand for glucose compared with last year. The growth in the sales of ORS and fruit salt has also doubled. Chemists on Darga Road and Paharpur Road reported a similar trend.        
	Hashim Ansari of Neu Plaza Medical on Paharpur Road said demand for medicines for dehydration and abdominal disorder were also on the rise.        
	There are some who are popping strong medicines as precaution without consulting doctors, said Ansari.

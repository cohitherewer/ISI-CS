										      book bazaar                        Saoli Mitra as Draupadi in Nathabati Anathbat				                           
	If monogamy is unnatural, polygamy is illegal, and serial monogamy is the way to go, why does it feel so wrong? This was the topic of discussion on June 19 at Crossword Bookstore at the launch of Himani Dalmias debut novel Life is Perfect.        
	The discussion led to more questions. Dalmias novel traces three years of Mitali Jaitias life, showing how she copes with love, life and loss. Moderated by Oindrilla Dutt, the panelists  Usha Uthup, Kishore and Rita Bhimani, Arindam Sil, Seema Sapru, Shreevatsa Nevatia, Parul Swarup, Devadason Sukumar and Amit Ranjan Basu  discussed their views on such matters.         
	While t2 columnist and PR professional Rita Bhimani stressed that in a male-dominated society polyandry is not much of a thought, her cricket-writer husband Kishore Bhimani brought in Draupadi, exclaiming: All the trouble begins with women! Actor Arindam Sil stressed that one should be able to set down ones own rules. Principal of Heritage School Seema Sapru felt young people didnt want to acknowledge parental separation.         
	Singer Usha Uthup recalled how her grandfather had remarried with his children as witnesses. She believed it was all in the mind, and quoted from the song You Light Up My Life. She also vociferously declared her preference for monogamy.

	A gang of six decamped with Rs 31 lakh early on Monday after overpowering four employees of a private security agency in charge of loading cash in ATMs. The men were attacked outside the ATM adjoining the Baguiati branch of Axis Bank.        
	We have got some clues in the case and are investigating all angles. The agency staff said the criminals looted Rs 31 lakh of the Rs 82 lakh they were carrying to disburse to other ATMs, said Supratim Sarkar, the superintendent of police of North 24-Parganas.         
	According to the police, the four agency employees  a driver, an armed guard and two cash managers  arrived at the ATM around 5am.         
	The car was parked about 20ft from the ATM and the cash managers carried the money in a briefcase towards the ATM. I was following them when two youths in their early 20s walked up to us and whisked out a countrymade gun. Pointing the revolver at the cash managers, they demanded the briefcase. When the cash managers refused, they beat them up and snatched the briefcase, said guard Barmeswar Yadav, who was injured in the ensuing scuffle.         
	Two other youths snatched Barmeswars rifle and hit him on the head with the revolver. He also sustained injuries in his hand, leg and chest.         
	In the melee, the cash managers and a security guard posted by the bank at the ATM, Amar Biswas, managed to enter the chamber. The robbers pulled down the shutter, trapping them inside.         
	Alerted by the commotion, some bus helpers of route 44 located nearby raised an alarm and the robbers fled with the briefcase.         
	According to driver Bikash Manna, who was also held at gunpoint, four youths sped away in an Ambassador parked nearby. One of the robbers threw away the keys of my car. He and his accomplice, who held a gun at me, left on an unmarked motorcycle, said Manna.         
	The police said they have found several discrepancies in the statements of the officials. They failed to tell us the exact amount looted. They quoted three figures. We are also trying to figure out how the robbers came to know the exact time the officials would reach the ATM, said an officer of Baguiati police station.

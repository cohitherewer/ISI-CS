The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Illegal LPG fuels shuttle cars 
                                                                                                               Illegal LPG fuels shuttle cars

	More than 70 per cent of the shuttle cars in Calcutta are fitted with illegal LPG kits that allow them to run on cooking gas at the risk of a tiny spark triggering an inferno on wheels.        
	Saheli Dasgupta, a regular shuttle-car passenger, would often wonder about the pungent odour inside the Maruti Omni vans plying between Park Circus and her office at Karunamoyee in Salt Lake.        
	 Whenever I asked the drivers where the smell was coming from, they would give vague replies. Then one day a driver spilled the beans  the car was running on cooking gas. I shivered at the thought of what could have happened if one of the cars I was in caught fire, Saheli, a resident of Jhowtala, told Metro.        
	Calcutta, which has around 2,500 shuttle cars, has witnessed at least two incidents in recent years triggered by a gas leak in LPG-run vehicles. Two Maruti Omni vans using makeshift LPG kits and running on cooking gas caught fire at Chetla and Alipore in November 2005 and January 2008. Fortunately, there was no casualty in either accident.        
	 Standard LPG kits manufactured by licensed companies come with a multi-dimensional safety valve system along with auto-shut facility that switches off the engine at the slightest hint of a gas leak. The multi-valve system also prevents a leak when the car is not in use. But a makeshift LPG kit running a car on cooking gas is a recipe for disaster, automobile expert S.M. Ghosh told Metro.        
	Officials of the public vehicles department admitted to being aware of the rampant use of illegal LPG kits, which apparently cost 50 per cent less than the approved ones.        
	Last year, we raided a few places on Rashbehari Avenue and in Behala, Mullickbazar and Tollygunge and seized several such LPG kits. Most illegal kits come from Delhi and are sold here for around Rs 11,000 each. A kit approved by the Automotive Research Association of India costs around Rs 22,000, an official said.        
	But is the difference in the initial investment the only reason why shuttle-car operators prefer illegal LPG kits to approved ones?        
	The primary reason is the price of cooking gas, which is cheaper than commercial LPG, the PVD official said.        
	A 14.2kg LPG cylinder costs Rs 328 and contains the equivalent of 21.3 litres of automobile LPG, which is priced at Rs 29 a litre. So a litre of cooking gas costs Rs 15.40, which is almost half the price of automobile LPG.         
	Bimal Guha, the secretary of the Bengal Taxi Association, said shuttle cars were not only using illegal LPG kits but also operating without commercial licences. The number plates of commercial vehicles must be in yellow and black. But most shuttle cars are registered as private vehicles. They do not follow specific routes, and the police look the other way.

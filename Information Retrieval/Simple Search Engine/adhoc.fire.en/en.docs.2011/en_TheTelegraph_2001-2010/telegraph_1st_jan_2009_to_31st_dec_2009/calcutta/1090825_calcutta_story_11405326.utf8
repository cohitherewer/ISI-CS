The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Terminal problem
                                                                                                               Terminal problem
          ONTHESPOT - PICNIC GARDEN ROAD                        The 39 bus stand on Picnic Garden Road eats up more than half the carriageway. Pictures by Talat Salahuddin                                      
	Three bus terminuses and autorickshaw stands on a 2km stretch of Picnic Garden Road in south Calcutta are a commuters nightmare.        
	Private buses on routes 39 and 39A/2, Deys Medical-Howrah minibus and autorickshaws plying on VIP Bazar-Ballygunge Phari route terminate on this road, which is barely 20m wide.        
	The 39 bus stand is opposite Tiljala High School, where the road is barely wide enough to accommodate two vehicles side by side. Parked buses occupy about half of the narrow carriageway, causing traffic snarls that often stretch up to half-a-kilometre.        
	Kiosks, where the timekeepers of the buses sit, have sprung up in the middle of the road, posing more problems for vehicles.         
	According to the transport department norms, bus terminuses should ideally be located on the outskirts of the city. On Picnic Garden Road, where the traffic load is increasing by the day, more than 50 buses, minibuses and autos are parked on any given day.         
	The road has become one of the busiest connectors to the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass after the commissioning of the Bondel Gate flyover.        
	The traffic load on the narrow carriageway has grown by over 400 per cent since the EM Bypass was commissioned, said residents of the area.         
	The state administration and police look the other way because local CPM leaders operate most of the buses and minibuses that encroach the road. Auto unions, also dominated by CPM supporters, will not allow the stands to be shifted elsewhere, said a resident.               
	Citizens voice                   Auto stands create bottlenecks on the narrow Picnic Garden Road       
	I dont understand why we must have private buses when the government can run enough state buses, which are comfortable and obey traffic rules. We had heard that the government was planning to ply state buses in this area but that was not done to protect the business interests of some party supporters. There is enough space on the eastern side of the EM Bypass to set up bus stands. But the authorities will not lift a finger to shift the stands  Himangshu Mondal, a resident of 165/1 Picnic Garden Road and a trader in the area        
	There are a large number of schools on the stretch. Parents are scared to send children to school by themselves because of the traffic chaos on the stretch. The police, political leaders and the bus operators are all hand in glove  Dolly Ganguly, a homemaker residing at 14/1 Picnic Garden Road.        
	Living in Picnic Garden has become hazardous. We are all victims of sound and air pollution. Unions and political leaders rule this place  Bhaswati Ghosh, a teacher living in Colony Bazar              
	Drivers voice:         
	Our stand came up about 45 years ago. The state government or the district administration or the police never came up with an acceptable proposal for shifting our terminus. We also face a lot of problems in driving through the Kustia and Colony Bazar crossings, which are very congested Bablu Mandal, who drives buses on route 39        
	It is very difficult to drive through Picnic Garden Road because while the population has grown 10 times, the width of the road has narrowed because of encroachments  K. Mohammad, who drives buses on route 39A/2               
	Government voice:         
	We cannot shift the bus stands until we identify a space to shift them. There is shortage of space in Calcutta. But we will definitely look into the matter  Sumantra Chowdhury, state transport secretary               
	Police version: Buses that ply on route 39 are impeding traffic flow on Picnic Garden Road. A space was earmarked near China temple on the eastern side of the EM Bypass to shift the stand but the bus operators did not budge. Sometimes, they get the local people to support their demand for not shifting the stand  an officer at Tiljala police station

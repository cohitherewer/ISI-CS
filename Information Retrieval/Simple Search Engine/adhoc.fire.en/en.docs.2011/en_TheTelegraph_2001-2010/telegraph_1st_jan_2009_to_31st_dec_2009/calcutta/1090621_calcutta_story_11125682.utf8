      Art of cinema as boi                             Kanan Debi and Pramathesh Barua in Mukti and (below) the poster of The World Unseen                    
	Moving away from the oft-repeated discussions on the influence of literature on cinema, Madhuja Mukherjee, a film historian and senior lecturer of Film Studies at Jadavpur University, drew her audiences attention to paintings that shaped Bengali films in the 1930s during a seminar on June 13 at Studio 21.     
	Mukherjee, who has worked on the studio era from the Thirties to the Fifties, picked Pramathesh Barua, visual cultures and the question of bhadrolok cinema as her topic for the evening.     
	My work has been related to looking at how cinema of that period has been a story-telling form. Cinema and literature have been studied a lot but not much has been written on the influence of art. In this particular discussion I chose to focus on Pramathesh Barua, whose visuals for his films were influenced by the modernist art of the Thirties, said Mukherjee, who also went on to analyse how cinema came to be a prime concern of the refined classes, the gentlefolk  the bhadrolok.     
	After a short introduction to Barua and the way he looked at cinema, Mukherjee began her presentation on film clippings and a slideshow of paintings to afford a glimpse into the movies of the Thirties.     
	I specifically discussed the films Mukti and Adhikaar for a relative study of the mise-en-scene, the settings, architecture and light in cinematic terms. The outdoor images in Baruas Mukti and their similarity to the water-washed technique in Abanindranath Tagores paintings are in contrast with his ideation of interior spaces in Adhikaar that employs Gaganendranath Tagores cubist tendencies, she said.    
	Tracing back the initial days of Bangla talkies, Mukherjee described New Theatres founder B.N. Sircars attempt to adapt novels and gather support from artistes in order to bring respectability to Bengali cinema.     
	He was instrumental in giving films a bhadrolok stamp. Cinema came to encompass issues of culture, technology and modernity. That is why Bengalis still refer to films as boi, said Mukherjee.    
	The gathering included a select group of painters, historians and young filmmakers. A research student wondered if Baruas works were also influenced by Japanese paintings that have inspired the Bengal school of art.     
	Dialogues, seen    
	Dialogues, the annual Calcutta lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender film and video festival, is into its third year and this year, the festival, hosted at Max Muller Bhavan between June 12 and June 14, managed to gather over 1,000 people. Which could do any mainstream film festival proud!     
	But then the gay community is being seen, heard, discussed and filmed like never before.     
	The inaugural ceremony had director Onir (My Brother Nikhil) standing up for minority rights with Nil of the designer duo Dev R Nil.     
	Queer films dont always get a platform to be showcased. Dialogues is that platform. We are not looking for a separate acceptance. No one is going to ask you whether you are gay or straight, so people can come here and watch the films, said Nil.     
	The opening film, A Jihad for Love, shot in 12 Islamic countries, by gay filmmaker Parvez Sharma saw a full house. The Fassbinder Retrospective, a collection of three short films  Fox and His Friends, The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant and In a Year of Thirteen Moons  from the repertoire of the German director, with emotionally charged narratives spruced with autobiographical elements from the directors life was stirring.     
	Day two was dedicated to shorts and documentaries and had three city entries: Ki Kotha Tahar Shathe  a film on male sex workers, Pablo, an abstract piece with no dialogues and Are We Talking Straight?. The daring and explicit All My Life, which portrayed homosexual life in Egypt, and the Lisa Ray-starrer The World Unseen, which dealt with sexuality and apartheid, were screened on the closing day.     
	The space was made interesting by paintings and posters by members of Sappho and Prattay, the organisers, installed along the stairwell leading to the main auditorium  wedding symbols with broken shankha, pala, cutouts of wedding cards and sindur; along with a girls first jeans, Frieda Kahlos paintings, excerpts of poems.     
	Films like Dostana trivialise the issue. As a director my work will be my verse, for a difference, said Onir. Because essentially we are not homophobic.    
	Mohua Das and Isphita Nandi

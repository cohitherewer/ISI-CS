                      India: At home and in the world                    Perhaps the most progressive among Indias national leaders of the pre-Independence era, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose inspired and encouraged his followers to plan for the reconstruction of free India as early as 1938. He also spoke about the need for the establishment of an international order based on justice, friendship and cooperation. Founded on his ideals, Netaji Research Bureau engages in historical studies and research on the Indian independence movement, anti-colonial liberation struggles in Asia, besides being involved in the study of post-colonial political and social changes, economic progress and cultural development in India and other Asian countries. To mark the 112th birth anniversary of Netaji, Netaji Research Bureau hosts two lectures that will shed light on Indias bi-lateral relations with other developing nations and also reflect on the countrys continuing British legacy. At 10.30 am, Alessandro Quaroni of Italy will deliver the Netaji Oration 2009 on The Kabul Connection: Subhas Chandra Bose, Pietro Quaroni and Indo-Afghan-Italian Relations. Based on his father Pietro Quaronis private papers and records in Italian archives, the speaker will recount interesting anecdotes about the way his father helped Netaji to go from Kabul to Berlin via Moscow on a false passport. At 6 pm, Professor Dominic Lieven of London School of Economics will deliver the Sisir Kumar Bose Lecture 2009 on Legacies of Empire: The British Empire in India in Comparative Perspective.

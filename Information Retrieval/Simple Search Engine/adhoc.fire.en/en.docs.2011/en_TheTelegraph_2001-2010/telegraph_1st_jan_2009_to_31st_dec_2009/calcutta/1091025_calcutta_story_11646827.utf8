The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | An Englishman in a Mughal mystery
                                                                                                               An Englishman in a Mughal mystery

	Why a Mughal murder mystery? First, I am very fond of history. Second, there is no tradition of historical detective fiction in Indian writing, said the author at the book launch at Oxford Bookstore.         
	Among her favourites are Ellis Peters (the pseudonym of Edith Pargeter), Judge Dee, the protagonist of Robert van Guliks detective series set in ancient China, and Sister Fidelma of Peter Tremayne. Belonging to this tradition, Madhulikas Muzaffar Jang from Mughal India goes about solving a series of murders (three to be precise) in his first stint as a super sleuth.         
	Muzaffar is adequately charming. Much like Holmes and Feluda, he is young yet not so young, a bachelor who is perhaps not of marriageable age any more but cannot be written off either, good looking, with an eclectic set of friends including a boatman, a jewellers assistant and an omrah (member of the nobility). He has a Watson in Akram, though the latter makes his appearance only halfway through the novel.         
	What was the method of collecting evidence during the Mughal period? asked novelist Rimi B. Chatterjee at the launch. The thumbprint was not looked for in the 17th century, during Shah Jahans reign. Indian jurisprudence was much ahead in crime detection than its western counterpart, countered Madhulika, who writes about forensic tests done on the poison used to murder the citys leading courtesan Mehtab Banu. The Englishman and his cameo, who offer the main clues to solving the murders, appear later in the book.         
	Liddle, who lives in Delhi, plans a series on Muzaffar and Akram.       ANASUYA BASU

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Better mishti on menu 
                                                                                                               Better mishti on menu 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Railway minister Mamata Banerjee has issued a series of directives for better passenger amenities, including one on a change of menu for the Rajdhani Express.        
	The minister has issued orders aimed at improving passenger services. She wants strict monitoring of the services of the Indian Railways Catering and Tourism Corporation, an official of the Eastern Railway said on Friday.        
	Several new items, such as fish curry and chhanar mishti, have been included in the menu of the Howrah and Sealdah Rajdhani trains. Some items  such as soup, salad and juice  have been reintroduced.        
	The two Rajdhani trains are offering fish curry as an alternative to the chicken dish. There is also chhanar mishti instead of dry sweets like shonpapri, the official said. The change in menu took effect a week ago. On the first day, 70 plates of fish curry were served on the Howrah Rajdhani.         
	Catering inspectors or officials from the hospitality sector have been assigned the task of monitoring food served by IRCTC. Food served on trains is often oily. There are also differences in the standard of food served on two different trains. We are addressing these problems, the official pointed out.        
	The authorities are also planning to change the bedrolls on several trains and revive the practice of keeping a suggestion/complaint box in the guards cabin.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bollywood whimpers back
                                                                                                               Bollywood whimpers back
  - New Hindi releases after nine weeks fail to impress          A STAFF REPORTER                                                  
	No rush at popcorn counters, no jostling at the audi door, no jam at the exit gate  Bollywood releases returned to screens after nine weeks, with anything but a bang.        
	The lack of quality content and star power ensured that Hollywood remained the Friday favourite with Angels amp; Demons. Kal Kissne Dekha, the first big-ticket Bolly release after the end of the producer-plex battle, starring newcomers Jackky Bhagnani and Vaishali Desai, barely registered average occupancy.        
	If the response to Kal Kissne Dekha was tepid, that to Mithun Chakrabortys Zor Lagaa KeHaiya! was cold. Friday occupancies were 8-10 per cent. Some shows may have to be cancelled over the weekend, admitted a plex source. Metro counted four heads for the morning show of Zor Lagaa Ke in Screen 2 of INOX, Forum.        
	Angels amp; Demons was the plex darling with 45-50 per cent occupancy.              
	The Dan Brown-Ron Howard-Tom Hanks film is doing very well across in all three INOX properties, confirmed Marya.        
	Angels amp; Demons is doing as well in mutiplexes as it did in single screens when it released two weeks ago, added a spokesperson for the producers, Sony Pictures.        
	Hollywoods domination looks set to continue with next Fridays Bollywood releases  Shreyas Talpade-Riya Sens Paying Guest and the stuck-in-the-cans Emraan Hashmi-starrer Raftaar 24x7  pitted against the might of Hugh Jackman in X-Men Origins: Wolverine and Christian Bale in Terminator Salvation.        
	Those trickling in to give the two Hindi releases a chance on Day One seemed to be there just to welcome Bolly back at the the plexes. We are here because we just had to break our forced Bollywood fast. But the film (Kal Kissne Dekha) left a bad taste in the mouth, winced the Agarwal family at Fame South City on Friday evening.        
	The screen space given to big bad Bollywood often at the expense of Tollywood is what Anjan Dutt has a problem with. The multiplexes are convinced that any Hindi film will run better than regional films and we suffer because of this mindset, complains the maker of Madly Bangalee.        
	If a film is paying why should it be moved away (from a prime slot)? I dont understand this, argues Dutt, who saw his film going from 18 shows at the plexes on Thursday to 11 on Friday, because of the return to Bollywood.        
	Just how much star value counts for the Bolly fan was clear from the decent opening of the Neil Nitin Mukesh-Bipasha Basu starrer Aa Dekhen Zara, re-releasing in plexes nine weeks after it fell foul of the producer-plex trouble and hit only standalones.

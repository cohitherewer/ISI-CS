                      Tradition and continuity in dance                    Odissi Vision and Movement Centre (OVM), Sanskriti Sagar and Open Doors present Poorva dhara, a three-day festival of the traditional dances of eastern and north-eastern India. An exploration of the progress, continuity and presentation of these forms of dance, it comprises two modules: Chaturanga and Vadya Sanchar. Choreographed by Sharmila Biswas with Neelay Sengupta, Chaturanga (picture right), to be performed this evening, is a new four-part production in Odissi by OVM. Mangalyam, the invocatory piece, is the gateway to the complexities of the dances that follow. Understanding musical notes and responding to them spontaneously forms the essence of Swara-Bilas. Katha Surpanakha portrays the many contrasting emotions that exist together in a person. It offers scope for subjective interpretation and analysis of a traditionally misunderstood character. Abartan Bibartan, the concluding piece, is about the cycle of rhythm and its evolution from simple to complex. Vadya Sanchar, to be performed tomorrow, is a unique presentation of Odissi, Gaudiya, Sattriya and Manipuri which shows how accompanying percussion instruments play a vital role in shaping dance techinques. It also seeks to establish the common links that bind these traditional dance forms. Choreographed by Priti Patel (Manipuri), Sattriya Kendra Guwahati (Sattriya), Dr Mahua Mukherjee (Gaudiya) and Sharmila Biswas (Odissi). The festival concludes on November 11 with an interactive session in which over 40 participant artists will meet critics, scholars and students of dance to share knowledge about the regional dances of the East and North-East.

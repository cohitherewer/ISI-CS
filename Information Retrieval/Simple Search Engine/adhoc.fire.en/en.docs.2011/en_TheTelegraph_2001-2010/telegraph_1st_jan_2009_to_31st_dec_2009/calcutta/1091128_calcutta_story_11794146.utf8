The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bollywood to basketball
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Bollywood to basketball

	The Puffin-Starmark Inter-school Quiz at Gyan Manch on November 16 saw author Ruskin Bond handing out prizes to students who answered questions on subjects ranging from Bollywood to basketball. Conducted by Derek OBrien, it saw six teams reaching the finals after a preliminary written round.         
	The buzzer round was the most popular, with questions ranging from what the duty of 15th battalion of the Jammu and Kashmir Rifles is and the first noun encountered in the national anthem. It took the La Martiniere for Girls (LMG) team seconds to give the answers: the Presidents Bodyguard and Bharat. The visual round saw students identifying cricketer Rahul Dravid from a photograph taken in his childhood.         
	Questions were reserved for the audience members, too, with Puffin publications of authors like Bond and Satyajit Ray given away as prizes.        
	The LMG team went on to win the quiz and took home goodies including a PlayStation 2 console each, books by author Ruskin Bond and gift vouchers. It was an easy quiz and we were prepared to win, said Shreemayee Das of LMG.        
	Delhi Public School, Ruby Park came second, and MP Birla Foundation third. The teams got Walkmans, iPods, gift vouchers and books.        
	The level of talent in the city is very encouraging, said Bond, signing copies of his books for eager youngsters. Even though we didnt win, meeting Bond and getting a book autographed by him was a big compensation, smiled Esha Meher of Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School, one of the finalists.

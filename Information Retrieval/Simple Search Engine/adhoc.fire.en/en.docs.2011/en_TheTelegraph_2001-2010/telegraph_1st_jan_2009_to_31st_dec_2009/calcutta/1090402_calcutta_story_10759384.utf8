The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hide amp; seek with cops by bridge
                                                                                                               Hide amp; seek with cops by bridge
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 22-year-old mentally unstable man played cat and mouse with police and firemen after jumping into the Hooghly on Wednesday.        
	Rakesh Jha, of Begusarai in Bihar, crossed the railing of Howrah bridge and jumped into the river around 9.30am. Passers-by informed the police and the fire brigade, who reached the spot to rescue him.        
	But Rakesh had swum to the other side by then. Some people then saw him playing and floating in the water.         
	The police rushed to the ghat where he had emerged, but Rakesh gave them the slip once again. A little later, someone spotted the youth perched atop a banyan tree on the bank. He was nude, having left his clothes in the water.        
	Firemen tried to reach him with a ladder, but Rakesh was in the mood for more mischief. With remarkable agility, he sprang from one branch to another as the police and firefighters looked on.         
	The huge crowd that had gathered to watch the drama didnt budge as Rakesh continued with his antics.        
	When Shibnath Panja, the station officer of Howrah fire services, started climbing the ladder, Rakesh jumped into the water again. He mocked the men on the bank by showing them his thumb.        
	With the cops reluctant to get into the water, it was left to Sriprasad Singh, a worker who was bathing near the ghat, to swim towards Rakesh and catch him.I saw the police looking extremely harassed. So, I went and caught him, Singh said later.        
	The police took Rakesh to Howrah District Hospital, where he was declared mentally unstable and referred to Calcutta Pavlov Hospital.        
	Rakeshs aunt, with whom he stays in Burrabazar, reached the hospital later and told the police that her nephew had been missing for four days.

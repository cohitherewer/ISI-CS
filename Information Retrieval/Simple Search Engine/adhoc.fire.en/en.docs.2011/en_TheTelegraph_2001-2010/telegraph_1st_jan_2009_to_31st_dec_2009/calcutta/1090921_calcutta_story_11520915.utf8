The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Majority flout pandal rule
                                                                                                               Majority flout pandal rule
  - Blaze claims a puja, firemen and cops list 761 errant ones          OUR BUREAU                                    
	More than 60 per cent of the puja pandals inspected by police and firemen over four days have been found to be flouting the government guidelines approved by the high court.        
	The revelation came hours after a pandal in Nabin Sarkar Lane was gutted in a fire early on Sunday. The Bagbazar pandal was found by the fire services team to have violated the norm of leaving four feet free on all sides.        
	Of the 1,125 pandals inspected, 761 have been found to have violated the fire departments norms, police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti said on Sunday. The police chief visited several pandals in north and south Calcutta over the weekend.        
	Besides, 10 teams in each of the five divisions  north, south, port, central and eastern suburban  are keeping an eye on the pandals, pointing out irregularities and asking the organisers to take corrective steps.        
	The cops have prepared a list of errant organisers but are not contemplating any action yet.        
	The police commissioner said a report listing the findings of the surveys would be submitted to advocate-general Balai Ray, who in turn would table it in the high court.        
	Citing instances of violation, an officer said the height of the Mohammad Ali Park pandal was more than the mandated 40 feet. The high court has categorically stated that the superstructure of a pandal cannot be more than 40 feet high. But the pandal at Mohammad Ali Park, thanks to a statue fitted atop, violates the norm, the officer.        
	Another popular central Calcutta puja  at Sealdahs Santosh Mitra Square  has been accused of breaching the height bar for the same reason.        
	The pandal at 5 Nabin Sarkar Lane caught fire around 2.30am on Sunday. Three fire tenders rushed to the spot but they could salvage little  even the deities were scarred. The organisers told the police that the deities were brought in minutes before the fire.        
	The pandal had not left the mandatory four feet space on all four sides and the exit gate was hidden from view, said a fire department officer.        
	The organisers, however, denied this. We have followed all the norms. The fire was lit by some criminals to sabotage our puja, said Goutam Haldar, a member of the Tal Betal Club which organises the Nabin Sarkar Lane Sadharon Durgotsab.        
	Fire department sources said the blaze might have been sparked by a cigarette or bidi. But we cannot say anything for sure till the forensic report comes, said the officer.

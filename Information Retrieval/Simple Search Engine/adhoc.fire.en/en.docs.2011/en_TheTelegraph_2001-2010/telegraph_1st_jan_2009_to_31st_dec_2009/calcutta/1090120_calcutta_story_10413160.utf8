The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sleaze racket bust
                                                                                                               Sleaze racket bust
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A sleaze racket was unearthed in a bungalow in Park Circus on Monday and seven persons, including a trader from Kerala, were arrested.        
	The seven have been booked under the Immoral Trafficking Act and will be produced in court on Tuesday.        
	Officers of the city polices detective department said they raided the house, whose owner lives in the US, after receiving a tip-off. The rooms on the first-floor were locked from outside and the guard and the caretaker were in their office rooms, said Jawed Shamim, the city detective chief.        
	When the caretaker was forced to open the doors, we found S. Hariharan Subramaniam, a trader from Kerala, in a compromising position with three women, said Shamim.        
	Ranjan Dhar, a young client from Behala, was found in another room.        
	Apart from Subramaniam, Dhar and three women, we arrested security guard Shantanu Maity and caretaker Paresh Giri, said Shamim.        
	The police are looking for Pratim Chatterjee, whom the owners had hired to supervise the maintenance of the house.         
	An officer said Maity and Giri would contact clients through agents. Once the girls and clients reached the bungalow, the duo would let them into the rooms and lock the doors from outside so that the local people wouldnt suspect anything, he said.        
	The police are also investigating if the owner was involved in the business.

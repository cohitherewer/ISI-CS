The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Kidney probe widens
                                                                                                               Kidney probe widens
  - Sleuths call for transplant papers from three hospitals          A STAFF REPORTER                                                   
	Two private hospitals in south Calcutta have come under the kidney racket probe, with police asking them as well as Apollo Gleneagles to submit all papers relating to organ transplants conducted by them in 2007-08.        
	The police have learnt during a preliminary probe that a patient each had died in the south Calcutta healthcare units during organ transplants in 2007-2008.         
	We need to check the documents to find out whether employees were involved in the racket that was unearthed on February 2, said an officer of the detective department.         
	Two of the accused  Sandipan Das, a former marketing executive of Apollo, and Prabudhha Bhattacharya, who worked for an information centre associated with the hospital  have revealed to the police that the recipient of a kidney had to shell out up to Rs 9 lakh.         
	The donor, in most cases from the underprivileged section of society, would get a pittance. The bulk of the amount went to the racket, said an official.         
	Sandipan and Prabudhha were arrested on Saturday night, along with another accused, Pradip Mondal.         
	According to the investigators, a Bihar-based doctor suffering from renal failure had entered into a deal with Sandipan to procure a kidney. The doctor was admitted in Apollo in January for dialysis.         
	The cops stumbled upon the racket following the arrest of two youths, Mithun Chatterjee and Hriday Kumar Dubey, at Apollo on February 2.        
	Last Thursday, the police picked up a 44-year-old woman, Chandana Mukherjee, in whose house the alleged kingpin, Manik Chowdury, would put up whenever he came down to the city from Delhi. An officer said on Monday that Chandana would pose as the mother, wife or daughter of the donor.         
	Apart from the alleged mastermind, the police are looking for four racketeers, believed to be residents of the Kadapara-Phoolbagan area.         
	The detective department on Monday sent a report on the findings of the probe to the health department for approval to start a case under the Human Organs Transplantation Act.         
	Till now, the charges slapped on the accused are under the Indian Penal Code, ranging from criminal conspiracy to attempt to murder.         
	Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra said he would go through the report and decide.

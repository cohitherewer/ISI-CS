          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                               
	The appeals moved by the seven accused in the Rizwanur Rahman case came up for hearing before a high court division bench on Monday, 14 months after the Supreme Court had ordered the bench to dispose of the appeals within six months.        
	In October last year, the apex court had stated that the trial of Ashok Todi, his brother Pradip, their relative Anil Saraogi, three police officers and Rahmans friend Pappu would start only after the division bench had disposed of their appeals.        
	Acting Chief Justice B. Bhattacharya said on Monday the hearing of appeals would be completed in three days but the lawyers representing the Todis and state advocate-general Balai Ray maintained that it would not be possible. The acting Chief Justice then said the bench would try to dispose of the appeals as soon as possible.        
	Appearing for Ashok Todi, advocate S.S. Kapoor on Monday read out first 100 pages of the high court judgment holding the seven guilty of abetting Rizwanurs suicide.

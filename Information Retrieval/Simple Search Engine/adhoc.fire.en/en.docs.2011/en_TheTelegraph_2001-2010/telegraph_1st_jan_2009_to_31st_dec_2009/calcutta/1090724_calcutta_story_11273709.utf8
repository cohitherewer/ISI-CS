The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Close shave for BSNL exchange 
                                                                                                               Close shave for BSNL exchange 
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	State-owned BSNL battled its second blaze in as many weeks on Thursday, barely escaping a network breakdown that would have put almost 10,000 Bfone and broadband connections in Beleghata on the blink.        
	The fire at the Beleghata Telephone Exchange compound left a 10,000sq ft godown gutted but spared the control room located hardly 50 ft away. It was a close shave. Had the flames spread even a few feet beyond the godown, we would have lost the exchange, said A.G. Khan, the division engineer (internal) of the telecom major.         
	A guard was the first one to notice smoke around 5.55am and call the fire brigade, which sent 15 engines to douse the flames. But the lack of a water source in and around the exchange was a big handicap for the firefighters. We had to depend on a pond located 2km away, said divisional fire officer Bibhash Guha.         
	The exchange is located at 23B Abinash Sasmal Lane.         
	An official of the West Bengal Fire and Emergency Services said the godown was a tinderbox.         
	We found it stocked with waste materials, wood and cables. But the cause of the fire will be known only after we get the forensic report, he added.        
	Exchange officials said the godown was locked for years.         
	On July 7, around 70,000 landlines and 10,000 broadband connections collapsed after a fire ravaged Circus Telephone Exchange on Hungerford Street.

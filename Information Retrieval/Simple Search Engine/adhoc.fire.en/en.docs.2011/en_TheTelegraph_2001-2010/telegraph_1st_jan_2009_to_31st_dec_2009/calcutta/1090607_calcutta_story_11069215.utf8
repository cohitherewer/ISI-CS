The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | One house, two homes
                                                                                                               One house, two homes

	I was asked this week if I had voted. For a minute, there was confusion  was the question in reference to the American elections of November 2008 or the recent Indian elections? Yes, I did vote in the US elections but not for the Indian elections. As an Overseas Citizen of India, I have given up my voting rights in the country of my birth. Being a dual citizen is common today. But it comes with its own dilemmas.         
	Most of us start off as reluctant immigrants. We come to the US, for education, for money, for love and marriage but dream of going back every day. We speak about it at summer barbecues. It is our safety net  we will go back before we have any kids; we will go back if I lose my job; we will go back after retirement.         
	But we dont. Instead, we move in the opposite direction. Bad economic times are not all bad. It is often a perfect time to buy a house, since the prices are down. In the last few months I have seen many of my immigrant friends, Indian and otherwise, taking this major step. It is a milestone that they resisted for long, many because of its implication of permanency.         
	Buying a house is a rite of passage. Even while we celebrate our first house, decorating it, getting to know the neighbours and the town Diner, we also know that we are slowly moving towards giving up a little part of our desire of going back home.         
	And then there is citizenship. Some of us do it easily; if we are paying taxes, why not get the benefits? Others go through guilt-pangs and say never can I give up claims and allegiance to my birth country. And still others say whats in a passport... I will always be of the country of my birth. Dual citizenship has made the process easier. We argue that we are not really giving up one country, only taking on another.        
	Globalisation, technology and mobility egg you on. Indian news reaches me online, on my TV and sometimes even via The New York Times. Visits of family from India have become the norm. Today, I can pick up the phone and hear my dog barking in Salt Lake. It creates a powerful illusion. It makes me believe I am right there.        
	So, as the years go by you buy a house, become a citizen, start a family, and start building a community. And then one day when someone asks about the elections, you wonder which of your countries is being referred to. You realise that the new country has also become your own and the we will go back may never really happen. But we would never like to admit it, because such is the nature of dreams.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Name, numbers hold up LPG switch
                                                                                                               Name, numbers hold up LPG switch

	Non-LPG autos are back to spewing noxious fumes on the road and in lanes while the conversion process drags on. Metro explores why is it taking so long for the three-wheelers to go green:         
	Tax dues: Applications by thousands of owners for conversion of their two-stroke autos are stuck because they are reluctant to clear their road tax dues.        
	Many two-stroke auto owners paid the tax only once  after buying the vehicle. Many second-hand auto owners did not pay the tax even once, said a senior official of the transport department. The dues range from Rs 15,000 to Rs 50,000.         
	Of the 7,800 legal autos in North 24-Parganas, about 2,300 have converted to LPG. The owners of half of the rest of the autos have run up hefty tax dues, said a regional transport authority (RTA) official.         
	All in a name: The regional transport authorities of Alipore, Howrah and Barrackpore do not have the names of the owners of over 60 per cent of the two-stroke autos. The state government has decided to hand over the ownerless autos to applicants  the drivers, in most cases. But the process is time-consuming.        
	We publish advertisements asking claimants to the ownership of autos in a particular lot to contact us within seven days. If there are no claimants, only then can we process the applications, said an RTA official.         
	Loan lock: In the city alone, 60 per cent of the 1,600 four-stroke autos were purchased with the help of loans, often from private finance companies. For conversion applications of these autos to be processed, the owners must provide no-objection certificates from the loan givers, which are difficult to obtain.        
	Scrap it first: Before an auto-owner is handed over the token that would help him get his application processed, the vehicle has to be scrapped.        
	This means it would have to be taken to one of the designated points where it would be destroyed. There is only one such centre in Calcutta and things are equally bad in the districts. As a result, the queue to scrap vehicles is growing daily, said a senior public vehicles department official. Many have chosen to ply their vehicles for the time being rather than join the queue.        
	Number game: The public vehicles department is in the dark about 1,400 autos that have permits and have not applied for conversion. The South 24-Parganas authorities have to deal with 7,192 applicants when only 5,007 autos have permit. Reason: Between 1996 and 2001, several autos were registered but not issued permits.

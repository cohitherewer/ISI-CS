The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Marmoset theft probe 
                                                                                                               Marmoset theft probe 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Maharashtra police on Wednesday tracked down the wife and son of Pune-based wildlife collector Vivian Solesman in connection with the marmoset theft probe.         
	Rajesh Singh, the alleged mastermind of the theft at Alipore zoo, had told Calcutta police that Vivian, 72, had paid him Rs 2 lakh in advance for the marmosets.         
	The cops questioned Vivians wife and son but released them after they failed to provide any information about him. The team found a pair of macaws in Vivians Pune flat and informed Nandankanan zoo in Orissa, from where a pair of the exotic birds were stolen a few months ago.        
	We have alerted all airports. Vivian, who has links in West Asian countries and allegedly trades in endangered species, might try to leave the country, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of Calcutta police (headquarters).

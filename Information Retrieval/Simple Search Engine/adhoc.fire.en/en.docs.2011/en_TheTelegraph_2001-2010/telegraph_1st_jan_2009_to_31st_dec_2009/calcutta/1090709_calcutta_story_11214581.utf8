                Parijat Aditya, 35, was arrested by Lake Town police on Wednesday after he allegedly tried to rape a woman he met through a matrimonial website. The Kasba resident allegedly molested the woman and tried to rape her at her Kalindi Housing Estate home on Wednesday afternoon after she refused to let him apply vermilion on her. The woman told the cops that Aditya left the house after she started shouting for help. A police probe revealed Aditya had lied to the womans family that he was an executive at an insurance firm. They also found that he was married.    The computerised railway ticket reservation centre near Rabindra Sadan would be closed for two months from July 11 for renovation, South Eastern Railway officials said on Wednesday. During this period, five extra counters would be opened at the SE Railway booking office in the Old Koilaghat building near Fairlie Place. After the renovation, three more counters would be introduced along with the present 10, the officials added.

Dasharath Routh, 45, died on Wednesday morning after being bitten by a snake on Tuesday night at his Shibpur residence. He was taken to Howrah District Hospital, where he died.    Police and officials of the Regional Transport Authority slapped fines on 20 private buses and minibuses in Howrah on Wednesday for using retreaded tyres. All the vehicles had fitness certificates. A senior cop said bus owners changed the old tyres during the fitness test and put back the retreaded ones after getting the certificate.     The meter box at Bikaneer Buildings on Lalbazar Street caught fire at 11.35am on Wednesday. Two tenders brought the fire under control around noon. No one was injured.

	I was deeply hurt by the article 50 reasons not to marry a Bengali man (October 4). Being in Calcutta, the city of Bengalis, you cannot hurt their sentiments. I request that in future such articles ridiculing any group not be published.             
	Soumyadeep Mitra                     
	The article was one of the best published ever. Although I dont agree with a few points, do come up with such articles.           
	Nikita Arora                     
	There are 101 reasons to marry a Bengali man. They are henpecked, they go to the market every morning to buy vegetable and fish even if that means a delay of a couple of hours to reach office as can be witnessed at Writers Buildings and other government offices. They are an intellectual lot, so they take special care to take children to school and coach them at home. They are gregarious and can discuss anything under the sun from making jhal muri to launching a space shuttle. They are very sweet by nature since they consume large amounts of rosogollas and mishti doi.           
	A.S. Mehta, New Alipore           
	The article was humorous and, to an extent, true. But then who is to be blamed for this sorry state of a Bengali man? The article says: The Bengali boys mother thinks hes flawless. Well, Bengali boys are after all shaped by the Bengali mom, who is a lady unfortunately!           
	Anirban RoyChoudhury,                     
	The quote: women love hot chillies, sour tamarind and stern husband is not from Khudito Pashan, it is from Rabindranath Tagores short story Manihara.

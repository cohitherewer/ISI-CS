	Four persons died in two accidents on Holi night in Calcutta and Howrah.        
	Seven-year-old Sreya Bag, her father Sukumar, 34, and his friend Gopal Jana, 35, were travelling on a motorcycle when a lorry dashed them and pinned them to a roadside stall in Bamunpara in Howrah around 10pm on Wednesday.        
	The three were taken to Uluberia Sub-divisional Hospital, where Sukumar and Jana were declared dead. Sreya succumbed to her injuries later, a police officer said.        
	Local residents, angry that the lorry driver and cleaner had fled before the police arrived, torched the vehicle. A large police contingent was deployed to control the mob. Two fire tenders, too, were sent to the spot around 11pm, but by then the lorry was charred.        
	According to the police, Sukumar and Jana were neighbours in Tulsiberia. On Wednesday, they had gone to nearby Abhirampur, where Sukumars wife had given birth to a daughter a week ago at her fathers house. Sreya was staying with her mother and Sukumar decided to bring her back home.        
	The trio were travelling on Sukumars motorcycle, with Sreya sitting in between, when the lorry hit them. The police suspect the driver had lost control of the vehicle.        
	In the other accident, Subhasish Ghosh, 35, an employee of the navy, was crushed under the wheels of a trailer on Central Garden Reach Road in the port area while riding his motorcycle. The police said the trailer was travelling at a high speed and hit Ghosh from behind. The Midnapore resident was taken to SSKM Hospital, where he was declared dead.

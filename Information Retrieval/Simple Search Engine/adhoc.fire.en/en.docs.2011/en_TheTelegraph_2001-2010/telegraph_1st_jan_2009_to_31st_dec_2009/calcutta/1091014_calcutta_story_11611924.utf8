The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rahmans back where he began
                                                                                                               Rahmans back where he began
  - Music maestro rewinds to his most memorable concert on charity visit          PRATIM D. GUPTA                          A.R. Rahman shares a charity stage with Sourav Ganguly on Tuesday. (Aranya Sen)                                        
	Even if I sneeze, Calcutta claps!        
	Six-and-a-half years after sending 90,000 music lovers in the city into a tizzy, A.R. Rahman  now a double Oscar-winning composer  clearly hasnt forgotten the magic and madness of his first live concert in India.         
	The Telegraph A.R. Rahmans Unity of Light concert remains the benchmark for the musical maestro. That was the most memorable concert for me and for all of us. I keep telling that to everyone. What a lovely audience Calcutta is they really love their music, Rahman told Metro on Tuesday evening.        
	The Jai Ho man, looking his usual casual self in a black T-shirt, grey blazer and blue jeans, had come down to the city to not only announce his November 14 concert at the same Salt Lake stadium, but also to attend a charity dinner to raise funds for a liver treatment and research centre coming up off the Bypass.        
	We get so many calls every day to do our Jai Ho Concert (in support of the A.R. Rahman Foundation) for different causes but the idea is to find the right people, revealed Rahman. And knowing what the intentions and aspirations the Liver Foundation of West Bengal has, its great to support this cause.        
	Sourav Ganguly, who has backed the project right from its opening over, came and thanked Rahman on behalf of the foundation. Referring to him as the great man, Sourav said: We cannot thank him enough.... I am now looking forward to hearing him next month.        
	And what can Calcutta expect from the man who rocked Kodak Theatre eight months ago? A lot of things have changed from the last concert.... I just hope everyone likes this show as much as they liked my first one.

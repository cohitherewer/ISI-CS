The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Teacher gherao over dress code
                                                                                                               Teacher gherao over dress code
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Eight teachers of Sarisha Ramakrishna Mission Sarada Vidya Mandir were confined in a room for over 10 hours on Monday by 1,000 students, guardians and local residents for their refusal to wear only white saris to school.        
	The group allowed the teachers to leave at 9.30pm after assistant headmistress Sarbani Chatterjee read out a notice stating that all of them had agreed to wear only white saris to school.        
	The teachers said the protesters had flung dusters and other objects at them. All of us were injured, said Jayotee Mitra Mukhopadhyay, one of the teachers.        
	The teachers refused comment when asked if they had agreed to wear only white saris to school.        
	The school has an 80-year-old tradition of teachers wearing white saris. The administration had allowed coloured saris after five teachers revolted against the dress code in December 2008.         
	The school secretary had then said Belur Math had asked them to allow the teachers to wear coloured saris.        
	The teachers, however, stopped coming to school the same month in the face of protests by some students and parents. They came to school on Saturday, the first day of the new session, and faced protests from students and guardians.         
	We will allow them to take classes and guarantee their security on the school premises only if they conform to the school rules, the assistant headmistress read out to the protesters on Monday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bullish on cattle class
                                                                                                               Bullish on cattle class

	Cattle class has edged out business class from many domestic and international flights from Calcutta with airlines realising that sacrificing legroom can give their flagging businesses a leg-up.        
	Emirates, Jet Airways, Kingfisher and other airlines have either scrapped business class or reduced the number of seats in that category to accommodate more economy-class passengers.        
	Business class was never hot in Calcutta, and the downturn has reduced demand by another 30 per cent. Company executives who used to fly business class are now seen in economy class, said Anil Punjabi, the chairman (east) of the Travel Agents Federation of India.        
	Kingfisher Airliness Calcutta-Bangkok service, to be launched on August 14, will be an all-economy flight. The only difference is that all seats will have in-flight entertainment, said a senior official.        
	The Airbus-320 will have 174 economy-class seats, which the airline hopes will bring in more revenue than a flight with the regular economy and business class ratio. Leisure travel hasnt been affected as much as business travel in recent months. So it is viable to have all-economy flights in certain sectors, said the Kingfisher official.        
	Emirates, which had 12 first class, 42 business class and 183 economy-class seats on each flight when it launched the Calcutta-Dubai service, has gone almost full economy. Low yield forced the airline to do away with first class and reduce the number of business-class seats to 27. Economy-class seats have been increased from 183 to 251, a source said.        
	Emirates intends launching five more flights a week in December with the accent on economy travel.        
	In the domestic sector, airlines have withdrawn business class from several routes over the past few months. Jet Airways now has only economy seats on some of its flights to Bangalore, Hyderabad, Agartala, Guwahati and Jorhat.        
	We continue to receive bookings for business class but the volumes arent large enough to be viable on all routes. So we have scrapped business class from some flights, a Jet official said.        
	Cash-strapped Air India is also going all-economy with Air India Express. We intend increasing the scale of Air India Express operations out of Calcutta, said a spokesperson. Air India Express now flies from the city to Singapore, Bangkok and Mumbai.                                                
	BUSINESS CLASS              
	Tickets priced at least 30 per cent higher        
	Spacious and comfortable seats, convertible to flat beds on long-haul flights        
	Personalised service        
	Greater choice of food and liquor        
	More baggage allowance         
	Meet and assist facilities at airport        
	Special waiting lounge

	Requiem for a million in Armenia        
	For many an Indian, April 24 is the Little Masters birthday. But for Armenians across the world, it was on this day in 1915 that around 250 of their leaders were rounded up by Turks during World War I and killed.         
	The day, known as the Armenian Genocide, was followed by the death of more than a million Armenians.         
	This year, the incident was commemorated by the Armenian College and Philanthropic Academy at Gorky Sadan with the screening of a documentary on the incident.         
	The aim of the event was to remind the young generation of the sacrifices made by their forefathers, said Fr Oshagan Gulgulian, pastor of the Armenians in India and former manager of Armenian College.         
	Reading out an address from the President of Armenian, Ashot Kocharian, the Armenian ambassador to India, said: This gathering of people from several diasporas to pay tribute to the victims will help in spreading awareness.         
	While students from classes VII to X put up an exhibition of photographs on the genocide, the school choir sang four songs in Armenian. We charred the black-and-white images at the edges and surrounded them by red handprints to depict the horror of the situation, said Arez Markarian, a Class IX student of the school, set up in 1821.         
	The school, affiliated to the ICSE board, has 80 students, including those from Iran, Iraq and Armenia.         
	Andrew Goldbergs 2006 documentary, Armenian Genocide, depicted the events that led to the April 24 massacre and its fallout. Including accounts of survivors, it described the survivors whose mourning remains incomplete as their pain has not been acknowledged by Turks or other nations of the world.        
	The programme included the recitation of the English translation of Armenian poet Siamantos The Dance. Siamanto was one of those killed in April 1915. It is about a German woman witnessing a group of 20 naked brides being whipped and burnt alive outside her window, explained Arez. The poem, dramatised by students, ends with the German woman wondering how she can gouge her eyes out after seeing something so cruel.

	Once, the tiffin a student took to school was a balance between what a child enjoyed eating and convenience. But now, the menu has come under the scanner of the school authorities. Gajar ka halwa, paratha dipped in ghee, French fries and burgers are being replaced with healthier food items like idli, poha and sprouted salads, with some schools even specifying menus for each day of the week.         
	The diktat has been in place since last year at Delhi Public School, Ruby Park, Laxmipat Singhania Academy (LSA) and Vivekananda Mission. LSA has sent circulars to students from pre-school to Class VIII listing food options.         
	We are trying to inculcate good habits in children from an early age. This will lessen binges on junk food that leads to obesity, among other health problems, says Meena Kak, the principal of LSA.         
	Others like Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School have instructed teachers to monitor what students eat during recess. We ask parents of children who bring excessively oily or fatty food to change the tiffin, says Malini Bhagat, the principal.         
	But eating healthy does not come easy. I have had to overhaul our entire breakfast menu to meet the schools specifications. I might have to wake up early in the morning to prepare idlis, something not even part of the regular diet in most homes, says Jonaki Bhattacharya, whose son studies in Class I at Vivekananda Mission.         
	This is why Mahadevi Birla prefers a set of broad guidelines rather than a strict food regimen. We want them to bring nutritious food according to their taste. It is no use asking them to bring something which they dont like and might not eat, says Bhagat.         
	According to Dr Narayan Bhattacharya, it fosters uniformity. If a child brings a pastry, while another brings puri, the second child is tempted to have the others tiffin, he says.         
	But Tapasi Sarkar, whose son studies in Calcutta Boys School, disagrees. We grew up sharing our tiffin. Friendships were strengthened over food. Todays kids will not have that, she says.

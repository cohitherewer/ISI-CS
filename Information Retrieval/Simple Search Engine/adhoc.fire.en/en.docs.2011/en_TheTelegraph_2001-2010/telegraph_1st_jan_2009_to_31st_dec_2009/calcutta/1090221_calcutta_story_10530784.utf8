The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | East-West channel to drain rainwater 
                                                                                                               East-West channel to drain rainwater 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Civic engineers are exploring the possibility of laying an underground pipeline from Subhas Sarobar to the Hooghly, alongside the proposed East-West Metro tunnel, to solve the waterlogging problem in the city proper.         
	Over 20 waterlogging-prone city pockets, from Camac Street to Shyambazar, could benefit from the project, according to the engineers.        
	Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay met chief engineer (drainage and sewerage) Amit Roy for a preliminary discussion on the scheme and directed him to prepare a draft feasibility study report.         
	It is too early to say anything. We have just started brainstorming over the possibility, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.        
	The Drainage and Sewerage Master Plan, prepared in 2007 under the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project, proposes a similar storm water drainage channel running north-south under CR Avenue, along the existing Metro Railway tunnel.        
	The cost of laying the pipeline was estimated at Rs 2,500 crore.        
	An underground tunnel will be built from Phoolbagan to Writers Buildings for the East-West Metro. Additional excavation for the proposed storm water conduit will increase the cost only marginally, said Roy.        
	If tunnelling and casting is done in sync with the East-West Metro work, the cost of the proposed underground storm water channel will be a third of Rs 2,500 crore, said civic engineers.        
	The conduit will ease pressure on Palmer Bazar pumping station, increasing its efficiency, added Roy.

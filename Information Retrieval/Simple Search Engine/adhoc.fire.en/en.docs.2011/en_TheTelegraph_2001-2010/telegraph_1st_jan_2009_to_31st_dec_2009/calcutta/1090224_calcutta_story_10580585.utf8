          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The family of a 24-year-old trainee software engineer from Salt Lake, who died on Saturday after returning home from office, lodged a complaint of negligence against officials of the firm on Monday.        
	Police have started a case of unnatural death and death due to negligence.        
	We are awaiting the post-mortem report to know the cause of the youths death, said Sujoy Chanda, the additional superintendent of Bidhannagar police.         
	According to Abhijit Chatterjees family members, he had complained of uneasiness and breathing trouble in office on Saturday and asked father Aloke to take him back home around 6.30pm.        
	Aloke reached the Salt Lake Sector I office from their Baisakhi Abasan home in 10 minutes. He found Abhijit very ill.        
	Employees of the firm stopped me from taking my son back home and made me write an application even though none of the senior officials was in office. We could leave only after 7pm, said Aloke, a state government employee.        
	Abhijit became unconscious after reaching home. He was taken to Bidhannagar State General Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.        
	The doctor who attended to him said he had turned bluish indicating poisoning.         
	An obstruction in the respiratory tract could also have led to his death, added the doctor.        
	Employees of the firm should have taken my brother to hospital earlier, said Abhijits sister.         
	The company management denied the allegation. We called Abhijits parents when he fell sick in office. His father himself asked him to stay back till 7pm, so that he was not marked absent for the day, said a senior administrative officer of the firm.        
	Abhijit graduated from Bankura Unnayani Engineering College last year and joined the firm in June 2008 for a monthly stipend of Rs 2,000.

                                                                                                               Todi bail hearing   put off

	The Supreme Court on Tuesday deferred the hearing of the bail petition of Ashok Todi, the key accused in the Rizwanur Rahman death case, till January 16 following the CBIs plea for time to state its stand.        
	The apex court had once earlier rejected the accuseds interim bail plea on the ground that the investigating agency was not served a notice.        
	Tuesdays proceedings started with Todis lawyer Harish Salve seeking bail for his client citing his age. Referring to the accused as an old man, Salve pleaded with the court: Its an open-and-shut case. Bail should be granted to my client.        
	But after the CBI pleaded for time, the bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan decided to adjourn the hearing till January 16.        
	Legal experts pointed out that the apex court could not grant bail to someone accused in a criminal case without hearing out the probe agency.        
	Todi has been in judicial custody since December 1, 2008, when he surrendered before the trial court. His earlier bail petition with the Supreme Court was rejected on December 19.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Strike worry for schools
                                                                                                               Strike worry for schools
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        
	The proposed indefinite transport strike has put Madhyamik schools in a spot.        
	The schools fear they would struggle to complete their curriculum for the shortened academic session in time if the students cannot attend classes for days because of the strike.        
	The session was shortened from 12 to 10 months in keeping with the government decision to gradually revert to the January to December academic calendar. Classes in Madhyamik schools will begin on March 1 instead of May 1 in 2010.         
	Every single working day has become important for us with the session being shortened by two months. We are already struggling to stay on course and will find it difficult to complete the syllabus before the annual exams next February if the transport strike goes on for long, said Krishna Damani, of South Point School.        
	St Lawrence, Nava Nalanda, Path Bhavan, Gokhale, Shree Sikshayatan and Scottish Church are some of the other schools likely to face problems because of the strike.        
	With buses and cars that transport students set to go off the road along with public transport, the school authorities fear that the attendance of students will dip from Friday, if transport operators go ahead with the strike.         
	We cannot force students to attend school if there is no transport on the road. But we also have to teach the entire syllabus to the students. We have started restructuring our academic programme to cope with possible disruption. For instance, we are trying to complete teaching more topics before Puja than we had originally planned, said Abhijit Panja, the teacher-in-charge of Scottish Church Collegiate School.        
	We have directed the schools to take appropriate measures to ensure that the syllabi are fully taught in every school, said Partha Ray, the board secretary.        
	The board decided to start the next academic session in March after the state government decided to revert to the pre-1979 system of beginning the academic system in January from 2012. The academic session will start in February in 2011.

	The General Hospital Territorial Army (GHTA) activated its casualty management unit at Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital (NRS) with a fortnight-long mock drill on the campus.         
	GHTA comprises state health workers trained in the management of military casualty. Set up during the 1971 war, NRS is one of the seven GHTA centres in the country.        
	NRS was chosen as a GHTA centre because of its proximity to Sealdah railway station. The unit has 500 beds in the four floors of the Centenary building at NRS, meant for use during a war, said a GHTA official.         
	The aim of the 15-day mock drill from March 16 was to gauge the efficiency of the GHTA personnel at NRS in war-like situations.         
	Steered by Lt Col S.N. Gangopadhyay, the module coached civilian doctors and nursing staff on treating and handling injured army personnel.         
	The purpose of the unit at NRS is to look after overflowing army casualties. During a war-like situation, the Command Hospital in Alipore will admit fresh casualties and send the recuperating patients to the NRS centre, said Siddhartha Niyogi, the deputy superintendent of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital and a GHTA member.         
	The NRS centre has 220 members  eight army officers and the rest comprising civilian doctors and nursing staff from RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, Medical College and Hospital and MR Bangur Hospital, among others.         
	The mock exercise helped us assess our skills. We can also use the techniques we have learnt in the disaster management cell we have at NRS, said Manjusree Ray, a GHTA member and the head of the department of anaesthesiology at NRS.         
	The centre holds classes for its members every Saturday.

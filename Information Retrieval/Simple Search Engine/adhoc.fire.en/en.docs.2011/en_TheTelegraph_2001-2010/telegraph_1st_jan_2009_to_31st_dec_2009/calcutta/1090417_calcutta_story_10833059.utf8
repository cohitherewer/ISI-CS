The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A breather from the swelter
                                                                                                               A breather from the swelter
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The city breathed a sigh of relief on Thursday as a cloudy sky brought traces of rainfall in the northern and central parts and the mercury dipped to its normal range for the first time in a fortnight.        
	The sweltering heat of the past few days may remain under check on Friday, too, as the Met office hinted at a thundershower, aided by a cyclonic storm that has developed over the Bay of Bengal.        
	The storm was centred over west-central Bay at 8.30am on Thursday and was moving north by 11.30am. The system is likely to intensify and move in the north-eastern direction, passing through the vicinity of the city on Friday. Under its influence, some areas of the city may experience a shower or thundershower towards afternoon or evening, said an official of the Regional Meteorological Centre, Alipore.        
	A thunderstorm develops when hot air rising from western Bengal and Jharkhand collide with moist air from the coast, said an official.        
	Friday temperatures are likely to range between 34 degrees and 26 degrees Celsius.        
	Thursdays maximum temperature was 35.6 degrees Celsius, which was normal. The minimum temperature was 27.4 degrees, two degrees above normal. The humidity rose to 90 per cent.        
	The promised Norwester, however, remains elusive though the atmospheric condition has been favourable since April 8. The city this season experienced two Norwesters, both in the last week of March.

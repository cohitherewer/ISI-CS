          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Three young employees of a dyeing unit in Bally, Howrah, were found dead in a room of the factory on Monday morning.        
	The three  Jayanta Das and Ranjan Mukherjee, both 18 and residents of Bagnan, and Kalyan Mukherjee, 24, of Shyampur in Howrah  lived in the room.        
	The youths died either of excessive alcohol consumption or suffocation. The bodies have been sent for post-mortem, said Sukesh Kumar Jain, the additional superintendent of police of Howrah (town).        
	Witnesses said the three had turned blue in the face and were frothing at the mouth. There was blood on their lips. Liquor bottles and food were found in the room, whose windows were closed.        
	Sushanto Karmakar, another factory worker, was the first to see the three lying in the room after Jayantas father Srimon, a cook in the factory, asked him to wake up his son so that he could go to the market to buy groceries.        
	I called them from outside the door. When they did not respond I pushed open the door and found them lying unconscious, said Karmakar.        
	He alerted the other employees in the factory, who called a doctor. He pronounced the three dead.        
	Residents said they had seen Jayanta, Ranjan and Kalyan return drunk from the city around 10.30pm on Sunday.

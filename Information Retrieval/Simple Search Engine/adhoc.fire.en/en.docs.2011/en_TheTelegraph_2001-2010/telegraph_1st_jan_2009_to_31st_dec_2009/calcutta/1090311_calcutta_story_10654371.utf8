	Traders of Marquis Street gheraoed New Market police station on Tuesday afternoon alleging that Mohammad Majid  said to be a CPM-backed strongman  had assaulted two of them.        
	Demanding the arrest of Majid, the protesters also blocked SN Banerjee Road for 20 minutes in the afternoon, throwing traffic out of gear. The roadblock was lifted after cops assured them of action.        
	Ranvir Gupta, a trader, had an altercation with a juice seller, who complained to Majid. The accused allegedly went to Guptas shop with his henchmen and beat him up, said an officer. My brother Rajesh tried to help me but they assaulted him, too, Gupta said in his complaint.        
	As the news spread, around 200 traders marched to the police station. Majid has been trying to intimidate us for long. We are not going to tolerate it anymore, said Rakesh Jadav, another trader. We are investigating the complaint, said a police officer.

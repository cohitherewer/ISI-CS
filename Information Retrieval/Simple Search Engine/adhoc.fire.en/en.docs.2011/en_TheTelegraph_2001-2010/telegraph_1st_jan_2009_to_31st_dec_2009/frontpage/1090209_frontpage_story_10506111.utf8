The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Blinds job card bares anomalies 
                                                                                                           Blinds job card bares anomalies 
  - Proforma prescribed   for NREGS execution        SUMAN K SHRIVASTAVA                            Suresh Nayak with his job card. Picture by Saikat Chaterjee                                              
	Ranchi, Feb. 8: He gropes his way even in daylight and his legs refuse him company.         
	There is no way Suresh Nayak  blind since birth and crippled after a paralytic attack  can dig a pond and carry mounds of earth from one place to another. But the job card possessed by his family under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) mentions that the 25-year-old worked for 17 days, between June 15 and July 17, last year. It means he earned something around Rs 1,574. The reality is Nayak never got the money because he was never given the job.        
	At the first-ever lok adalat organised by the high court mandated state legal aid authority in Latehar yesterday, Nayaks father, Ram Chandra, alleged that block officials had entered his sons name in the job card and siphoned off the wages. Interestingly, the youths name also figures on the list of pensioners, clearly hinting at the gross anomalies in the UPA governments flagship scheme.        
	The lok adalat was organised to hear the fate of over 20,000 complaints registered against the faulty execution of the NREGS in the state.        
	Nayaks case was certainly not exclusive. Other petitions mentioned how block officials siphoned off funds under the NREGS with impunity in remote corners of the state. Under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, one family  comprising husband, wife and adult children  gets one job card that entitles them to at least 100 days of work in a year.        
	Dilip Singh of Kope village in Manika block of Latehar district claimed that he had not received a single penny though his job card showed that he had worked for 12 days last year. Another resident of the same block, Tulli Thakur, said that he had demanded a job on July 11 last year, but the block development officer (BDO) turned him down, saying his application was not proper. Such petitions are telltale evidence of how block officials withdrew funds without giving jobs to bona fide workers.         
	Balram of Gram Swaraj Abhiyan and an associate of NREGA architect Jean Drze, claimed that the job scheme information posted on the state site is inadequate and gives BDOs and other block officials scope to manipulate workers lists and embezzle funds. The site claims that a job seeker is given work the very day he tenders an application. This is a blatant lie. Had the situation been ideal, 20,902 complaints would not have come up for hearing before the Jharkhand State Legal Services Authority (Jhalsa), he said.         
	The problem of denial of job by BDOs on one ground or the other without making an official record is disturbing. So, we have decided to print a proforma and distribute it among job seekers so that BDOs can never say that applications are not proper. We have also decided to begin a kaam mango abhiyan (campaign for job), he pointed out.        
	Under the NREGA, the government is required to pay an unemployment allowance to job seekers who are not given the same within 15 days of demand. The act also mandates a fresh scheme if 10 persons demand job at a time. So, the proforma will have a provision of 10 persons demanding job simultaneously.         
	There should also be a message from Jhalsa that it means business. There has been a complaint against a presiding officer of the lok adalat who allegedly kept files pending. Authorities must probe into the matter, Balram said.

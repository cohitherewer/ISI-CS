          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Imphal, Feb. 2: Three officials of the Manipur food and civil supplies department remained untraced after being abducted by an unspecified militant group, allegedly for ransom.         
	Official sources today said a militant group abducted Imphal West district supply officer S. Iboton Singh, Imphal East district supply officer W. Deven Singh and Bishnupur district supply officer Th. Bhumeshore Singh on Friday.         
	The abductors reportedly informed the department that the officials were being held captive. The department filed a complaint with police today.         
	Sources said a militant group called the three officials to an undisclosed place on Friday. They did not return from the rendezvous. It is not known whether they went together or separately.         
	A militant group is holding them hostage. The group is demanding a huge amount of money for the safe release of the three officials. We cannot disclose the name of the group for safety of the hostages, a source said.         
	The police said they have registered a case and efforts were on to find the hostages.         
	The employees of the food and civil supplies department today decided to indefinitely close down all godowns located in the districts tomorrow. They are likely to stage a sit-in tomorrow to demand the safe release of the officials.

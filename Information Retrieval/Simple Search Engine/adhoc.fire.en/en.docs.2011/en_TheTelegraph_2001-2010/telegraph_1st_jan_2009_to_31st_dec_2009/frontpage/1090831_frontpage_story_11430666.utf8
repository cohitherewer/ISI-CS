The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Force India on F1 podium
                                                                                                           Force India on F1 podium
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Aug. 30: Italian Giancarlo Fisichella today gave an Indian team its first champagne-drenched moment in a sport of fast cars, huge prize money and beautiful women.        
	Vijay Mallyas Force India got its maiden Formula One podium finish  and first points ever  when the 36-year-old Roman came second at a chaotic Belgian Grand Prix in Spa-Francorchamps, a day after earning his team its first pole position.        
	Fisichella later dismissed as speculation and rumours the buzz that he had one foot in Ferrari, and could be driving for the Italian team at the next race in Monza, Italy.         
	In response to a question from The Telegraph during a teleconference, Mallya said: Im not willing to talk about Ferrari. All I can say is I have neither been approached by Ferrari nor has Fisichella told me anything about it. Its just speculation.        
	Fisichella then came on the line. Im just concentrating on Force India at this moment, he said.         
	Fisichella was a little sad at losing by just 0.9 seconds to Ferraris Kimi Raikkonen, mainly because of a technology, KERS, that gives his rivals car a brief boost at the push of a button.        
	Of course I could have won. I was quicker than Kimi and he could just overtake me because of the KERS at the beginning. Still, I kept pressing hard and finished less than one second behind, Fisichella said. He added: The target was to win our first points and I finished second to get eight points. So that is great but Im still a little sad since I could have won the race.        
	Fisichellas feat could spark interest in India ahead of the proposed grand prix in New Delhi in 2011. It may also help rub off some of the disappointment felt when the lone Indian F1 driver, Narain Karthikeyan, 32, dropped out of the circuit after an uneventful three years with the Jordan and Williams teams.        
	Fisico or Fisi  who has driven for Renault, Sauber, Jordan, Benetton and Minardi and won three races in his 13-year-old F1 career  had yesterday joked he had luck on his side after hitting a rabbit in practice. My engineers told me that in England when you do something with a rabbit it brings you luck, he said.        
	Today Raikkonen was the hare and Fisi the hound, chasing the Finn all the way after he had snatched the lead using KERS. The Italian, however, was flawless rather than flamboyant, displaying fine race craft after an opening-lap pile-up had sent defending champion Lewis Hamilton and championship leader Jenson Button crashing out.        
	With this, Fisichella has renewed his tryst with Spa, where he had finished second in a Jordan car in 1997.                     WITH AGENCY REPORTS

  - With a helping hand, President begins UK visit          AMIT ROY                                                                 
	Windsor, Oct. 27: Pratibha Patil was greeted today with a 41-gun salute and a ceremonial at Windsor Castle the like of which neither she or those Indians lucky enough to be present will witness again in their life time.         
	The British put on a spectacle of such breathtaking military precision that the Queens Indian guests were left dumfounded.         
	A British royal photographer, who has shot ceremonials at Windsor Castle from every conceivable angle, was deliberately nonchalant.         
	Well, he said, eyeing the cavalry, the soldiers and all the Queens uniformed men that went into welcoming Indias First Citizen, lets say they have had a bit of practice.         
	The president was not taking any chances with the British weather at the start of her state visit to the UK even though it was relatively mild today. Over a pale sari, she had donned a white coat and had her pallu wrapped firmly round her head in a style she has made all her own.         
	She also wore white gloves, as opposed to the black ones which she showed off on arrival.         
	As she stepped down gingerly from the dais to inspect a guard of honour, the Duke of Edinburgh gallantly reached out and steadied her lest a moments carelessness should cause a diplomatic event. In the event, all was well. Patil made it back safely to the dais after walking past a long line of soldiers who towered above her.         
	The Queen and Prince Philip left Windsor Castle at 11.40am by car to go and collect their guests from a point outside the castle not far from Eton College. She returned in some style after guns had boomed a 21-gun salute from the Royal Palace and a separate 20-gun salute from the Royal Park.         
	First to emerge into the Quadrangle at Windsor Castle in the Australian state coach were the Queen and the president.         
	This was followed by the Scottish State Coach which carried Prince Philip and the presidents husband, Devisingh Ramsingh Shekawat.         
	The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall followed them in the Semi-State Landau, which also brought Daggubati Purandeswari, minister of state at Human Resource Development, and Lord Vestey, Master of the Horse.         
	The No 1 Ascot Landau was given over to Dr Christy L Fernandez, secretary to the president, Nirupama Rao, the Foreign Secretary, Nalin Surie, the High Commissioner, and his wife, Poonam.         
	The No 1 Ascot Landau is so called because there is a No 2 which brought Lt Gen Vinod Chopra, Military Secretary to the president, Sunil Lal, chief of protocol in India, Vijay Thakur Singh, Joint Secretary and social secretary to the president, and Pradeep Bhardwaj, Chief Security Liaison.         
	The British had their women in top jobs, too  Sara Thornton, Chief Constable of Thames Valley Police; Dr Christine Hill Williams, High Sheriff of the Royal County of Berkshire; and the Hon Mrs Bayliss, Lord Lieutenant of Berkshire.         
	Precisely at 12.15pm, the band of 1 st battalion of the Irish Guards struck up Jana Gana Manaand in tune, too, followed by God Save the Queen.         
	The Guard of Honour was mounted by the Irish Guards who had practised to ensure every man Jack was in a straight line.         
	Then came the heart-stopping thunder of hooves, led by the Mounted band of The Blues and Royals, the Kings Troop Royal Horse Artillery, the March Past and the Sovereigns Escort of the Household Cavalry Rank Past. The Raj was back in business  or so it seemed this morning. The red of the uniforms contrasted with the stone of Windsor Castle, which is 900 years old, the monarch will tell the president.         
	The Queen did not make the mistake of helping Patil down from the dais. The two elderly grandmothers then walked off slowly off, side by side, through the Sovereigns Entrance for a spot of lunch.

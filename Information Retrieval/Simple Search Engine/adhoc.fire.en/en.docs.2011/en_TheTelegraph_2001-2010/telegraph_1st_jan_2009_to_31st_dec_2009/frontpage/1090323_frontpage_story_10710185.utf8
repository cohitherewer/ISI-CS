                                                                                                           Lalu to fight Cong seats
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 22: Lalu Prasad today announced his party would contest the three seats the Congress had won in 2004  Sasaram, Aurangabad and Madhubani.        
	If the name UPA remains, well and good. Otherwise some other name can be adopted and some other front can be formed, he said. But, in the same breath, he added: It is my responsibility to keep the UPA intact and I am ready to make any sacrifices for it.         
	The Congress alone had not constructed the UPA, he said.        
	Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan had earlier decided to leave the three seats where the Congress has sitting MPs to that party, while carving up the remaining 37 seats among themselves.         
	The announcement that the RJD would contest even these seats came after the Congress declared it, too, would fight 37 seats and leave only three where Lalu Prasad and Paswan are contesting.        
	Lalu Prasad compared the Congresss attempt to build its organisation by fighting as many seats as possible to digging a well when ones house is on fire. However, he insisted he had high respect for Sonia and did not wish to involve her in controversies.        
	Paswan was upset with Lalu Prasads anti-Congress tirade yesterday and rushed to meet him at night, sources said. The LJP leader advised Lalu Prasad not to pitch the fight to a point of no return, since the third front had not reached out to them and they could not do business with the NDA.        
	Paswan told Lalu Prasad a divided UPA would eventually help the NDA in Bihar. It was not expedient to train guns on the Congress and allow the BJP-Janata Dal (United) to gain, he argued.         
	When Lalu Prasad was asked today if his relationship with the Congress would lead to a long-term estrangement, he said: Sometimes bitterness is sweet. Bitter medicines are good for health.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Freddie Mac CFO found dead at home
                                                                                                           Freddie Mac CFO found dead at home
          CHARLES DUHIGG                            David B. Kellermann                                  
	New York, April 22: David B. Kellermann, the acting chief financial officer of the troubled mortgage giant Freddie Mac, was found dead this morning at his home in Northern Virginia, the police said.        
	The executive apparently committed suicide by hanging himself, according to people with knowledge of the investigation.         
	A spokeswoman for the Fairfax county police said there were no signs of foul play. A police spokesman said that they would not comment on whether a note was found, but did say that no files or anything except the body have been removed from the house.        
	Police were called to the home at 4.48am, reportedly by Kellermanns family. His body was taken away by the Fairfax Coroners Office shortly before 9am.         
	Kellermann, 41, had been Freddie Macs chief financial officer since September. He was named to the position when the federal government seized the company and ousted its top executives last autumn. In recent weeks, according to neighbours and company officials, Kellermann had received a bonus of about $800,000. Such bonuses  which totalled $210 million for executives at Freddie Mac and its sibling company Fannie Mae  caused some controversy earlier this month.

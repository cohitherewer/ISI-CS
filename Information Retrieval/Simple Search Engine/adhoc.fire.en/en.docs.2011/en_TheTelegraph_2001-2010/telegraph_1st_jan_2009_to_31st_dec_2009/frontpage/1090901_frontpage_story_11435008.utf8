  - Alleged thief escapes from under cops nose, caught later           A STAFF REPORTER                            The marmosets in Calcutta before being taken to the zoo hospital. (Bishwarup Datta)                                        
	Calcutta, Aug. 31: The alleged marmoset thief made a monkey out of Calcutta police early this morning, casually walking off a train while being brought back from Chhattisgarh under handcuffs.        
	Raj Saikia was re-arrested late tonight, so police will have ample time to ask him which had been easier to pull off: his own escape or his alleged theft of eight Common Marmosets from Alipore zoo, for which he was arrested by Chhattisgarh police on Friday.        
	Raj, 33, had ambled off when the Down Ahmedabad Express stopped at Orissas Jharsuguda station at 4.45am on its way to Howrah. The embarrassment left DIG, headquarters, Jawed Shamim groping for an explanation in Calcutta.        
	Maybe it was because the handcuff sat very loose on his slender hands, Shamim reasoned. Or maybe the constables had dozed off.        
	Raj, however, made a mistake. He got into another train back to Chhattisgarhs Durg, the site of his August 28 arrest. Local policemen and six Calcutta officers sent there this afternoon grabbed him as he got down at 11.45pm.        
	Earlier, Calcutta police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti had to face the query why he shouldnt accept responsibility and resign.        
	After the August 9 marmoset theft, the forest department had sacked zoo director S. Chowdhury and overhauled the 15-member management committee.        
	Drawing such a parallel, Chakrabarti said, would be improper ----- the zoo director had only a particular zoo to take care of while the police chief had to look after his entire force and not just one unit.        
	I dont think this is the right parallel. But I know the best team was sent for the job and an officer of the rank of inspector was there to lead it, which should have been enough, the commissioner said.        
	He promised to be stern: If four persons cant get an accused back, there is definitely negligence on their part and well take necessary action against them.        
	Detective department inspector Debasish Sarkar, sub-inspector Prosenjit Bhattacharya and two constables had boarded the train with Raj and three Calcutta zoo officials at Bilaspur station around 12.30am.        
	The four policemen, a zoo assistant director and Raj were in an AC two-tier coach while the two other zoo employees were in an AC three-tier compartment with the seven recovered marmosets in two cages.        
	Chhattisgarh police had failed to recover one of the eight stolen marmosets from Raj alias Rajesh of Guwahati, who has a record of dealing in rare animals and birds in Mumbai and Pune.        
	The two constables, Samsher Khan and D.G. Mahato, were the first to notice that Raj was missing and informed the officers. The train was still in the (Jharsuguda) station but they failed to trace Raj, a senior police officer said.        
	A team of six officers led by an assistant commissioner was sent to Jharsuguda this afternoon to conduct a probe. We will take actions on the basis of this report, Chakrabarti said.        
	The city police brass have got in touch with Jharsuguda police chief Kavita Jalan and drawn up a joint manhunt plan to trace Raj. Our energies and resources right now are directed towards getting him back, DIG Shamim said.        
	Sources said Calcutta police had released a photograph of Raj to district police chiefs across the country. A photograph was also sent to all local news channels along with details on Raj, including the numbers of his three mobile phones.        
	Our team is on the job and we are checking possible hideouts, said Murali Patel, officer-in-charge, Government Railway Police, Jharsuguda.

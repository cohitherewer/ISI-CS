  - CID claims auditor duo cleared forged Satyam papers for a price           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            S. Gopalakrishna                                        
	Hyderabad, Jan. 24: Two Price Waterhouse partners were arrested today for alleged falsification of Satyam Computer Services audit reports in connivance with promoters led by founder and former chairman B. Ramalinga Raju.        
	S. Gopalakrishna and Srinivas Talluri were held this evening by investigators of the Andhra CID after questioning that lasted several hours yesterday. Both have been remanded in judicial custody for 15 days.        
	CID sources claimed that the two auditors had admitted to have cleared forged bank statements and other unverified documents for a price. But the sources did not specify the nature of the alleged favours. Confessions during interrogation are not admissible in court.        
	A spokesperson for Price Waterhouse, the statutory auditors of Satyam, said it had not seen any evidence of any wrongdoing by the two.        
	CID chief A. Sivanarayana had said earlier in the day that the auditors had been detained for their connivance with the promoters. The detention was later converted into formal arrest.        
	Gopalakrishna, Price Waterhouses chief relationship partner at Satyam, and Talluri, its engagement leader, are accused of issuing certificates for balance sheets and other financial statements prepared by the erstwhile Satyam management over the past eight years. The Satyam scandal had come to light when Raju claimed that the companys balance sheets showed non-existent cash surplus and bloated profits.        
	The two auditors had been quizzed last Tuesday at Price Waterhouse offices in upscale Jubilee Hills and Satyam Info City. On Thursday, they were called to the CID headquarters.         
	The CID sources said Gopalakrishna, a member of an Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) council in the southern region, had been censured for audit problems in India Cements takeover of Raasi Cements in 1998. Gopalakrishna was also a signing authority on the financial statements of Global Trust Bank, which collapsed under the weight of financial irregularities, and had to be merged with Oriental Bank of Commerce in 2004.        
	In Delhi, a Price Waterhouse statement said: We greatly regret that two Price Waterhouse partners have been detained today for further questioning. We do not know the basis for them being detained.

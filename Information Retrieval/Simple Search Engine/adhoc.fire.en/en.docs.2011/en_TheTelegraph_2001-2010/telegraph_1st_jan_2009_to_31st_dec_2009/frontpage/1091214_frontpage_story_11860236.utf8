	Ranchi, Dec. 13: There are campaigners and then there are star campaigners. During the ongoing five-phase Assembly elections in Jharkhand, the real stars on the campaign trail have been the chief ministers of model states who have been here to hold up their examples for Jharkhand to emulate.         
	From Chhattisgarhs Raman Singh to Jammu and Kashmirs Omar Abdullah, from Gujarats Narendra Modi to Bihars Nitish Kumar, the list has been impressive. Today, the Congress flew in Bhupinder Singh Hooda of Haryana and Ashok Chavan of Maharashtra to woo voters in constituencies going to polls on December 18.         
	While Chavan addressed voters in Palamau (Leslieganj, Chhatarpur and Saraidih), Hooda wooed voters in Hussainabad, Barkatha and Daltonganj Assembly constituencies.         
	Abdullah campaigned for Congress during the fourth phase of elections, and Nitish campaigned for seven days in the state, addressing several rallies jointly with BJP president Rajnath Singh over the last four phases. Today, Nitish addressed meetings in Bhavnathpur, Garhwa and Panki with BJP general secretary Arun Jaitley.         
	All the chief ministers are ones who are seen as role models in their respective states. The Congress is concerned about the development of Jharkhand. Chavan and Hooda were voted to power for second terms and their campaigns will make a difference. They are role models of development, Union minister and Congress election campaign committee chairman Subodh Kant Sahay said.        
	He said pushing two chief ministers together on to the campaign trail on a single day would earn maximum mileage for the last phase. We will do everything to ensure a comfortable majority in the Assembly. Thus we are taking the help of chief ministers who beat the anti-incumbency factor in their respective states to return to power, Sahay said.        
	State BJP president Raghubar Das too justified using the services of the role models to turn the table on opponents. The purpose behind fielding such chief ministers on the campaign trail is to gain confidence of voters. Raman Singh, Modi and Nitish have a clean image and have shown the country how to put a state on the fast track for development. These chief ministers have fulfilled their promises, he said.         
	Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavati too campaigned in the state for her party nominees. Her Bahujan Samaj Party is contesting all 81 seats.        
	While campaigning today, Hooda expressed surprise over the fact that people in rural Jharkhand lived without basic infrastructure like roads and electricity. He said while Haryanas mineral resources were not a patch on Jharkhands, the latter was still lagging way behind.        
	The Congress has not got an opportunity to govern the state. I appeal to the people to give a chance to the Congress and see how development projects can be put on the fast track, claimed Hooda at a press conference before embarking on electioneering.        
	When he was reminded about Congress supporting the 23-month-old Madhu Koda government and four-month-old Shibu Soren regime, Hooda said political situations sometimes warranted such measures. Hooda added that Haryana would extend its help to develop Jharkhand.

	Ranchi, Dec. 16: The office of the chief electoral officer has taken cognisance of a statement made by Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad on a Rs 120-crore upgrade plan for RIMS in Ranchi.         
	Reacting to a report published in The Telegraph today, joint chief electoral officer Ashok Kumar Sinha said Azads statement amounted to violation of the model code of conduct. A report would be sent to the Election Commission which may issue a notice to the Union minister.         
	Sinha said 308 instances of model code violation across the state had been brought to the ECs notice and FIRs lodged in 302 cases so far. Two cases of code violation were reported on December 12 from Garhwa.

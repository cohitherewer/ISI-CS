	Patna, April 15: A day before the first phase of elections in Bihar, 10 Naxalites were killed and a BSF jawan was injured in an encounter that was a result of an early morning assault in which the rebels used rocket launchers on a school housing security men.        
	The fierce gun battle took place on the Kaimur range of Rohtas district, 220km from here, between 75 BSF jawans and 300-odd Naxalite guerrillas armed to the core with sophisticated weapons, including rocket launchers.        
	Guerrillas had surrounded a government school at a village in Dhansa valley where a company of BSF jawans was being put up to provide security to 30 polling booths in Chainpur and Chenari segments of Sasaram Lok Sabha constituency, where the CPI(Maoist) had called for a poll boycott recently.        
	Around 1am today, the rebels fired at the school thrice from rocket launchers, partly razing it to the ground. The village (in which the school is located) is 20km south of Sasaram-Rohtas district headquarters and is bordered by Palamau (Jharkhand) on one side and Uttar Pradesh on the other.        
	Police suspect that Maoists from Jharkhand joined in for the massive attack.         
	Rohtas superintendent of police Vikas Vaibhav confirmed that this was the first report of rebels using rocket launchers. They (rebels) launched thrice and one hit the target.         
	But, the BSF jawans were better equipped and retaliated, triggering a gun battle that lasted four hours. The rebels were unable to match BSFs fire power and were demoralised after they lost 10 men.         
	The injured jawan has been admitted to Patna Medical College Hospital where he is stated to be out of danger.         
	Inspector-general of police (Patna) Sunil Kumar, who was in the attack zone, said: We have launched a combing operation and remain determined to carry out our duty.         
	The administration will be using an air force plane for aerial surveillance of the first phase of polling tomorrow.         
	Police sources said the area around the school is often referred to as a cluster camp (in police parlance) meaning a rebel den. The rebels also conduct training in several camps that have been set up on the Kaimur range. A week ago, BSF jawans had found out and demolished two such camps.         
	Deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi has demanded more paramilitary forces in red zones, while RJD chief Lalu Prasad took the opportunity to attack the government for its failure to check Naxalism.

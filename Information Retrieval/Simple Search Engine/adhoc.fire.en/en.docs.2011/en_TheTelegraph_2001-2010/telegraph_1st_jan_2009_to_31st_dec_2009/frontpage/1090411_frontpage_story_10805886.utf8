The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Twin troubles for JMM ahead of polls
                                                                                                           Twin troubles for JMM ahead of polls
          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA AND GAUTAM SARKAR                              
	Ranchi/Dumka, April 10: JMM candidates have started to feel the poll pinch  both in terms of finance and leadership  with Durga Soren vitiating the ties with the Congress and Shibu Soren recuperating in Delhi.        
	The senior Soren used to be the lone star campaigner for the JMM, but he is still in the hospital and not likely to be fit soon to canvass for party candidates before the first phase of the polls on April 16.        
	After the Durga episode, the Congress star campaigners are apparently not going to JMM constituencies. The Gandhi scion, Rahul, campaigned in favour of Rameshwar Oraon (Lohardaga) and Saurabh Narayan Singh (Hazaribagh). Sonia Gandhi would also address rallies in support of Congress nominees in Khunti and Chatra. Although Rahul is slated to visit Jharkhand and campaign for Congress nominees in Chaibasa and Dhanbad, he is unlikely to go to JMM stronghold areas in Santhal Pargana.        
	We have to fend for ourselves, said former deputy chief minister Sudhir Mahto, who today campaigned for party nominee Shivlal Mahto in Hazaribagh. We will talk to the Congress to come to our rescue, he said.        
	The JMM has not requested us for any of the star campaigners. We are always ready to help them out if the request comes from our partner, said Congress spokesman Ravindra Singh.        
	Sudhir said JMM leaders, including Hemlal Murmu and Haji Hussain Ansari, would campaign for Congress nominee Furkan Ansari in Godda. Guruji has instructed Murmu to side with Ansari in the larger interest of the Congress-JMM ties, he said.        
	The JMM nominees are also facing acute funds crunch in absence of Guruji on the poll scene. The candidates have got some funds from the party but it was peanuts. They have to arrange the funds themselves, Sudhir added.        
	Meanwhile, JMM campaign both in Dumka and Godda got off to a sombre note with the arrival of Durga at Godda last night. Durga said he was locked in a friendly fight with Ansari. The JMM is already locked in friendly fights with the Congress in Hazaribagh and Koderma, he added. He also claimed that he was the partys caretaker chief till Shibu was in the hospital.        
	Veteran party workers from Santhal Pargana, who had supported Durgas move, however, apprehended split in the party, as leaders from Chhotanagpur region have started raising their voice against the junior Soren.        
	There was not a single senior leader except the partys Shikaripara MLA and former minister Nalin Soren at the JMM chiefs residence in Dumka today. Everybody is tensed, Nalin said.

	Feb. 11: Terrorists firing automatic weapons and wearing suicide vests burst into three facilities, including Afghanistans justice ministry, in the heart of Kabul, killing at least 26 people in wanton slaughter reminiscent of the Mumbai attacks.        
	Mumbai revisited Kabul in more uncanny ways than one. The assailants sent three text messages to the leader of their terror cell in Pakistan before launching the assault, said Amrullah Saleh, chief of Afghanistans intelligence agency.        
	During the Mumbai attacks in November, the terrorists had maintained phone contact with minders in Pakistan, receiving instructions and alerts about security movements.         
	Taliban took responsibility for todays four-hour ordeal ahead of a planned visit by Richard C. Holbrooke, US President Barack Obamas special envoy. At least eight attackers also died, but it was not clear whether the 26 dead included the terrorists.        
	The attacks displayed the apparent ease with which Taliban which control much of the Afghan countryside can also breach the defences of the heavily fortified capital. They also underlined the severity of the challenge facing the Obama administration, which has declared the war in Afghanistan a high priority.        
	The latest carnage came seven months after a suicide strike on the Indian embassy in Kabul killed several people.        
	In the main incident this morning, five men armed with guns and suicide vests killed at least one guard outside the justice ministry, then went inside and began firing on guards and employees throughout the four-storied building.        
	Afghan officials said at least one or two of the attackers were killed at the start of the raid. But it was four hours until all five had been tracked down in the building and killed by commando teams called to the scene. It is not clear why the men did not detonate their explosives.        
	The group stormed the building around 10am local time and they were killing whoever came in front of them, said Fazul Rahman, a ministry employee.        
	A pair of suicide bombers struck at a separate ministry facility in northern Kabul. A lone suicide bomber was also killed outside the education ministry.        
	Like in Mumbai, the attackers were aged between 20 and 25. But all were said to be Afghans.        
	A Taliban spokesperson said its fighters had attacked the justice ministry and a prison department office building in revenge for the torture of jailed insurgents.        
	The Taliban spokesperson Mujaheed said several other suicide bombers might still be at large in the city, a fear Mumbai had also gone through after 10 militants, firing automatic rifles, stormed the city and held dozens hostage in a nerve-wracking three-day siege that left nearly 180 dead.        
	At first, it appeared as if a hostage situation was developing in Kabul, too. Justice minister Sarwar Danesh told AP by mobile telephone that he was holed up in the building where a number of gunmen were also hiding. Agencies later reported that he had been rescued.        
	The police said they believed one assailant had been cornered in the ministry but security forces were unable to move in further because children were trapped at a kindergarten inside the building. But, after a gun battle in which 60 shots were fired, the police said the attacker had been killed.

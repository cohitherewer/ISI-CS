  - Ribbing and repartee at Cambridge VCs Delhi meet										      AMIT ROY                        Alison Richard (second from left) and Sumant Dhamija address the alumni in Delhi on Sunday				                                 
	New Delhi, Jan. 11: The vice-chancellor of Cambridge, Alison Richard, was gently chided today for beginning her current tour of India in the universitys 800th year, not in Delhi, but in Calcutta.         
	At a farm outside the capital, she met the universitys influential Delhi alumni, whose president Sumant Dhamija said this was effectively her first meeting in India with former Cambridge students because Calcutta does not count.         
	Dhamija, who read economics at Emannuel College from 1970-73, was booed by the Bengal contingent of the alumni, one of whom, Jay Bhattacharjee, who had been at Christs from 1963-66, shouted back: Without Bengal, you would be nothing!         
	The former BBC correspondent, Mark Tully, entered the good-natured fray, and said he would not tolerate this intellectual assault on Calcutta, the beloved city of his birth. I am appalled, admitted Tully.        
	Richard included a brief visit to Calcutta in January 2008 but liked the city and its alumni so much that this time she began in Calcutta. She has spoken to the Bishop of Calcutta as well as officials of the British deputy high commission in the eastern city and is optimistic that when the bells of Cambridge ring out on January 17 to mark the universitys 800th anniversary, the bells of some of the churches in Calcutta will peel in harmony.        
	Dhamija covered himself in sackcloth when approached by The Telegraph. Calcutta does count, he grinned sheepishly. I was trying to tease a few Bengalis.        
	To be fair, members of the Delhi alumni have been taking practical steps to pay tribute to a Bengali student of Cambridge  Jagadish Chandra Bose.        
	A bust of Bose to mark his 150th birth anniversary was unveiled last November at Christs where Bose studied Natural Sciences and made the transition from pioneering work in radio waves to pioneering work in plant sciences.        
	It now appears that enough Indian money has been pledged to finance two JC Bose Scholarships, tenable at Christs, in the field of natural sciences. To encourage successful candidates to do research in the spirit of Boses work, there will be a one-year MPhil course to help students to make the transition from physics to plant sciences  something Bose had done.        
	The prime mover in raising the money is Ranjit Nair, the director of the Delhi-based Centre for Philosophy and Foundations of Science, who described Bose as the father of bio-physics.        
	Instead of financing the scholarships through interest from an endowment, which would require a lot of money, he is working to ensure that the 26,000 a year needed to keep an Indian postgraduate student in Cambridge was guaranteed for 10 years.        
	The scholarships will happen, said Nair. The question is whether it is this year or next.        
	The vice-chancellor, dressed in a summery white suit, seemed at ease among alumni who urged her to make her trip to India an annual event.        
	Dhamija, who has raised money to send some Indians to Cambridge, spoke from the heart when he recalled his magical time at the university and welcomed his guest of honour. You are the vice-chancellor of the greatest university in existence, declared Dhamija. The challenge is to keep it that way.        
	Richard said she was aware that poor but bright students in India, who had their heart set on Cambridge, needed financial help. This is my first visit overseas in our 800the year, said Richard, who has lunched privately with Manmohan Singh, who is a Cambridge man. Cambridges approach to its engagement in India is very much one of partnership  a flow of people and ideas back and forth between Cambridge and Indian institutions and also collaborative activity working together.        
	She pointed out: It is very much a two-way flow. We have a large number of Cambridge academics and particularly their postgraduate students coming over to India working in collaboration. It is just exploding with interest and vitality.        
	She disclosed: Over the last decade, the percentage of postgraduate students from India studying at Cambridge has doubled and the number of undergraduate students is close to 50 per cent higher than they were a decade ago. That trend continues.        
	She spoke of the need to give more help. We know and you reinforced in conversations with me the need for more financial support for students from India so that talented students, regardless of their family background, would be able to study at Cambridge. With respect to undergraduates, I have that much on my mind. We are working at it. It is a focus for the university as well to reinforce the support that we can provide to talented Indian students.        
	She explained that in 800 years, Cambridge had survived several plagues, dissolution of the monasteries, a civil war, two World Wars, a great depression. We have not just survived, we have flourished. It is important for us to take the long view.        
	She mentioned two birth anniversaries of two of Cambridges greatest sons - Charles Darwins 200th and Jagadish Chandra Boses 150th.         
	We celebrate the past but we live very much in the present. Cambridge is endeavouring to maintain its great sense of place, remarked the first full-time woman vice-chancellor in 800 years.

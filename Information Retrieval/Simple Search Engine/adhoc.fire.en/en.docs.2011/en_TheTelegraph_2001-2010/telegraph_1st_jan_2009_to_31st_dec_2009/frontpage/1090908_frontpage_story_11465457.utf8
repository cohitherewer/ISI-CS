          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                               
	New Delhi, Sept. 7: The CBSE will make its qualifying public examination after Class X optional starting 2011, the government announced today, lifting a cloud of confusion hanging over students slated to appear for the test this academic year.        
	The statement makes it clear that the students now in Class X will have to take the test in March-April 2010 and the optional examination will come into force only in 2011.        
	But grades will replace marks as a barometer of performance from this year, according to the timeline for change unveiled today.         
	The new evaluation system will start with students currently in Class IX in Central Board of Secondary Education-affiliated schools, the board and the human resource development ministry have announced.        
	Students now in Class X will receive grades instead of marks based on their score in each subject in their board exam. We want to end this pressure that makes all students study for six months for a single qualifying examination, HRD minister Kapil Sibal said.        
	Starting with the current students in Class IX, the CBSE will divide the year into two terms, with continuous and comprehensive evaluation (CCE) in each term on the basis of fixed guidelines.        
	The CCE  conducted by the school itself based on the CBSE guidelines  will start from October in the current Class IX.         
	In each term, the CCE will consist of two sets of formative assessments  based on the students performance in class discussions, quizzes, projects and laboratory work.        
	Apart from the formative assessments, students will have to appear in term-end summative assessment tests  also conducted by the school.        
	At the end of the year, each student will receive an overall grade in each subject  based on his performance in formative and summative assessments over the two terms.         
	If a students grades  from the CCE  at the end of Class X allow him to continue in the same school in Class XI in the stream of his choice, he need not take the optional board examination.         
	But if the student needs to change his school, he will need to appear for the optional CBSE-conducted test and present his grades in this test while seeking admission to Class XI in a new school.         
	The CBSE will also start aptitude tests that students can voluntarily take after Class IX and Class X to help them choose a stream in Class XI. Grades obtained in an aptitude test will, however, not be considered while seeking admission to Class XI.         
	Each grade has a corresponding grade point.

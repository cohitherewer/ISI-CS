          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                     
	New Delhi, Feb. 9: Faculty at the IITs, IIMs and other technical education institutions will receive salary hikes accompanied by a bouquet of perks and research incentives under a pre-election package to be unveiled by the government.         
	Besides, teachers in hundreds of university engineering colleges and in the National Institutes of Technology will for the first time receive higher pay than provided by the University Grants Commission, The Telegraph has learnt.        
	Faculty in the IITs and the IIMs already receive salaries higher than UGC scales  their pay will now rise further.         
	A central technical education pay review panel headed by former Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, director Goverdhan Mehta has recommended that salaries for all technical education teachers be raised higher than that of university teachers.        
	The panel submitted its report to higher education secretary R.P. Agrawal on Friday, sources said. Mehta confirmed that he had submitted the report to the human resource development ministry, but did not divulge details.        
	But government sources said the report for the first time aimed to correct a historic imbalance in the pay structure of faculty in India.        
	At present, teachers at the NITs and in engineering, management or architecture colleges of universities receive the same salaries as their counterparts in humanities or the pure sciences.         
	The private sector demand for qualified professionals is, however, significantly higher than the demand for those trained in the humanities and the sciences, officials said.        
	We were losing the best brains from these institutions to the private sector. The Goverdhan Mehta committees recommendations, which we are likely to accept, will work towards correcting this historic imbalance, a ministry official said.        
	The committee in its report, however, has not accepted a demand of teachers at the NITs that their pay be brought on a par with that of IIT faculty. The NITs and university teachers of technical education will receive a pay a step higher than other university teachers. The IITs and IIMs will receive a take-home salary another step high, the official said.         
	An earlier panel had on an average recommended a salary hike of 70 per cent  the Mehta committees recommendations, sources indicated, could improve that by around 10 per cent.

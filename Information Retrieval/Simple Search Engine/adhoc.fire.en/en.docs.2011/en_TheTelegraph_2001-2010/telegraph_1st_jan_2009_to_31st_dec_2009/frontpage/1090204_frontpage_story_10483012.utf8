                                                                                                           Constitutional crisis in CPM 
          JAYANTH JACOB AND OUR BUREAU                                              
	Feb. 3: The Indian Constitution is offering cover to a show of defiance in the CPM, plunging the party into a crisis ahead of the Lok Sabha elections.        
	V.S. Achuthanandan, Kerala chief minister and a CPM veteran, today publicly defied the official party line that a CBI corruption case against Pinarayi Vijayan, the partys state secretary, was politically motivated.         
	Vijayan and Achuthanandan have been locked in a feud that has festered into one of the most intractable problems stalking Prakash Karat since he took over the CPM that was once known for its discipline.        
	Achuthanandan, who has been tormenting his party with bouts of silence and non-committal repartees, broke through the veneer in Delhi.        
	If I say anything about it (the probe), it will amount to questioning the court. As I was sworn in to protect the Constitution, I cant criticise the court, he told a media conference.        
	The comment stood out in sharp contrast with a statement issued by the CPM politburo on January 22: The steps taken by the CBI to prosecute Pinarayi Vijayan is politically motivated.        
	Achuthanandan said he did not want to criticise the CBI either, again contradicting the politburo.        
	 Last week in Kerala, Achuthanandan had given a sneak preview of his course of action, saying he would abide by the Constitution on the question of permission to prosecute Vijayan but stopping short of disagreeing with the party line.        
	But today Achuthanandan  the only living person among the 32 members from Kerala who left the CPI National Council in 1964 to form the CPM  spelt out clearly his refusal to criticise the high court, anchoring his stand on the bedrock of the Constitution.        
	A flashback to the seventies will show how stunning  and for the CPM, galling  the chief ministers public pronouncement is.        
	The CPM always had an uneasy relationship with the judiciary  the misgivings articulated by the late E.M.S. Namboodiripad, who headed the worlds first democratically elected communist government in 1957.        
	 In the 1970s, the Supreme Court had upheld a Kerala High Court contempt case against EMS for suggesting that in the event of a conflict between a poor man and a pot-bellied rich man, the court often stood by the latter. The court had then said EMS had failed to read Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels properly  an observation that rankled the party for years.        
	The virtual revolt by Achuthanandan, whose clout in the party organisation has been eroding steadily but who is still considered popular among voters because of his squeaky-clean image, will make it more difficult for the Left to repeat this year the 2004 performance of bagging 19 of the 20 Lok Sabha seats in Kerala.        
	The almost clean sweep, which propelled the Left to its best-ever tally, helped the CPM call the shots at the Centre for quite some time.        
	With the stranglehold on Bengal turning shaky after a series of setbacks, a Kerala crisis is the last thing Karat would have wanted before the elections  probably the sole reason Achuthanandan survived as chief minister till now.        
	After his constitutional candour, Achuthanandan called on Karat and informed the general secretary that he wouldnt be attending an ongoing roadshow by Vijayan in Kerala.

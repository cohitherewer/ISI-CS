	Mumbai, July 17: When the world sees what caused Neil Armstrong to commit a grammatical gaffe when he uttered those now-famous words after helping mankind take a giant leap with his moonwalk, an Indian company will claim credit for making mans first steps, and a stumble, discernible.        
	A subsidiary of the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group has digitally enhanced the dark and fuzzy TV images of Armstrong and fellow astronaut Buzz Aldrin toddling on the moon 40 years ago.        
	The result has revealed the gaffe more clearly: Armstrongs famous one small step was actually a stumble. In the nervous moment when the astronaut became the first to set foot on the moon, he forgot to say a before man.        
	Lowry Digital, a Hollywood-based subsidiary of the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group company Adlabs Films, has done the enhancement work. Lowry has completed the initial phase of the restoration of the 150-minute footage beamed to the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) from Apollo 11, which includes 15 sequences.        
	The enhanced footage now shows the clear outline of Armstrongs spacesuit and helmet, a sharp improvement over the murky blob of the original. Aldrin, who followed Armstrong down, is seen making a two-footed jump off the module.        
	We are honoured to have been selected by Nasa to handle the restoration of this historic footage, said Adlabs Films chief executive Anil Arjun.        
	Nasa got together all the initial nine astronauts shortlisted for the moon project and released parts of the restored film in Washington yesterday.

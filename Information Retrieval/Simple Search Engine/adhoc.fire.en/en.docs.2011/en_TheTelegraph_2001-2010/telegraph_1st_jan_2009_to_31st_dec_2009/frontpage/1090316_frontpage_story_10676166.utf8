The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Third front? No, an open-door platform 
                                                                                                           Third front? No, an open-door platform 
          JAYANTH JACOB                                          Mayavati at the dinner.   Picture by Prem Singh        New Delhi, March 15: Call it anything but the third front.        
	Prakash Karat and friends today emerged from Mayavatis dinner with a nameless dish in the hope that prospective converts from the UPA and the NDA would find its nebulous character palatable after the elections.        
	The diners scrupulously avoided using the two words  third front  opting instead for the unwieldy but manoeuvrable non-Congress, non-BJP secular formation.        
	Sources said the decision not to button up the formation in a straitjacket was taken keeping in mind the possibilities that could be thrown up after the polls. If neither the Congress-led alliance nor the BJPs counterpart manages enough numbers, the absence of a formal pre-poll group might make it easier for some allies from either combine to join what now looks like a confederation of regional players.        
	The meetings of the nine parties today discussed the formation of a non-Congress, non-BJP government at the Centre. We have told Mayavati about our discussions. There was no question of a pre-poll electoral alliance at the discussions. The alliance will take place after the elections, CPM general secretary Karat told The Telegraph.        
	Karat was referring to the meeting of the four Left parties, ADMK, BJD, JD(S), TDP and the TRS before their leaders, minus ADMK representative V. Maitreyan, drove to the dinner hosted by Mayavati.        
	Referring to suggestions that a deal could not be reached with Mayavati, Karat pointed out that a pre-poll arrangement with the BSP was never on the cards and an understanding was supposed to take place only after the elections.        
	That the alternative front was playing for the post-poll phase became evident earlier in the day when the CPMs Sitaram Yechury called on Janata Dal (United) leader and NDA ally Sharad Yadav.        
	The meeting fuelled speculation of a Naveen Patnaik-like pullout by another NDA ally but Left sources said that was not the intent because the Dal(U) government in Bihar was dependent on the BJP.        
	But the post-poll options are open. We have said we will work with all secular and democratic parties to form a non-Congress, non-BJP government, Yechury said.        
	The open-ended nature was also evident in the statement issued by the nine parties. We, the non-Congress, non-BJP parties, have resolved to work together to defeat the Congress and the BJP. We shall work together to form an alternative government. We appeal to all secular and democratic forces and all sections of the people to support this endeavour.        
	ADMK sources said their representative did not attend the dinner as the invitation came late yesterday, and it was not a very political event.

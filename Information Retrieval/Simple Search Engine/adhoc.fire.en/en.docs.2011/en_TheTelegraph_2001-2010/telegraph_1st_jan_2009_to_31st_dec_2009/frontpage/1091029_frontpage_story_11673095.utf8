	London, Oct. 28: Grandmothers are programmed to prefer their sons daughters to their other grandchildren, according to scientists.        
	The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, found that a grandmothers love for her grandchildren is partially rooted in DNA. The Cambridge University scientists concluded that a grandmother shares most genes with her sons daughters  and the least with her sons sons.        
	The researchers first used the laws of inheritance to work out how genetically similar a woman is to her childrens children and found that overall, a grandmother and grandchild share around a quarter of their genes. But differences in the way the genes on the X chromosome are passed through the generations mean that some grandchildren share more than this.        
	A woman passes around 31 per cent of her genes to her sons daughters but just 23 per cent to her sons sons. Her daughters children fall in the middle, with both sexes sharing around 25 per cent of their genes.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Mother gets 33 years for killing daughters
                                                                                                           Mother gets 33 years for killing daughters
          AMIT ROY                            (Top) Rekha Kumari-Baker and (below) her daughters Davina and Jasmine				                           
	London, Sept. 22: A judge said today that he did not really understand why a mother should kill her own children after Rekha Kumari-Baker was given two mandatory life sentences totalling 33 years at Cambridge Crown Court for murdering her daughters, Davina, 16, and Jasmine, 13, by repeatedly stabbing them with purposely bought kitchen knives while they slept in bed.        
	Mr Justice Bean admitted he was baffled after presiding over a case whose brutality makes it probably unique in British legal history  Davina, stabbed 39 times, was found hunched by her bed.        
	Most people will find it inexplicable that a mother could kill her own children and you have given no explanation for it, the judge told Rekha, who will almost certainly be put on suicide watch in prison.        
	The jurors heard that she was angry after her divorce from her husband, David Baker, and angrier still after he had found a new partner, and her bitterness grew after 41-year-old Rekha, who worked as a waitress, was dumped by her boyfriend Jeff Powell.        
	The police appear not to have delved into Rekhas family origins for she came to the UK from India when she was only nine months old and treated her as a British woman.        
	In fact, had the judge consulted Indian psychiatrists and doctors, he would have discovered this is not the first time in British criminal history that one Indian parent has sought to inflict the maximum pain on the other parent by removing that which the latter cherishes most  the children. This is a peculiarly Indian crime though this particular tragedy has taken place in the heart of English Cambridgeshire  in the past it has usually been the father who has killed his children before committing suicide.        
	Detective Inspector JIm McCrorie, the senior investigating officer, told The Telegraph, that Rekha came from the Punjab as an infant, and has family in England. She has a mother, a sister and brothers but because of the nature of the case, they did not come to court.        
	 Unaware of the Indian psyche, the judge used British law to pass sentence, telling Rekha he had considered imposing a life means life sentence before deciding on 33 years. Taking away the two years and 92 days she had been in custody, she would not be considered for parole until 2040 when she would be 72.        
	 You were certainly upset at the breakdown of your relationship with Jeff Powell, said Mr Justice Bean. On the basis of the evidence of (psychiatrists), I think mild depression was probably combined with a wish to retaliate against David Baker and destroy the happiness in his life. But to some extent your motive remains a mystery.        
	She had been found guilty of the two brutal murders on the basis of clear and compelling evidence.        
	The judge added: Despite the diligent and professional efforts of your legal team, the evidence in support of your defence of diminished responsibility was flimsy and unsubstantial. You knew quite well what you were doing and you were not mentally ill. The crimes were, as the prosecution rightly put it, murder, full stop. Davina and Jasmine were cruelly cut down in the prime of life. Their death has been a shattering loss to their father and friends.        
	 Social workers had been also called in previously to examine the familys circumstances because of its troubled history.        
	But the judge said: This is not one of those murder cases, in my view, where the professionals, or anyone else, overlooked some obvious indication that the children were at risk. Hindsight is a wonderful thing but there was no evidence called in this trial to show that anyone should have seen this terrible crime coming. The defendant alone was to blame.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Missing therath, not the reason
                                                                                                           Missing the rath, not the reason
          L.K. Advani is flying from one meeting to another, fighting probably the last and most significant election of his life. Manini Chatterjee reports                            Advani reads a book in the plane on way to a campaign meeting in Orissa on April 15. (PTI picture)                                  
	For the past several weeks, Lal Krishna Advani has been spending a lot of time in a new home  actually two  in the skies.        
	The first is a Hawker, a neat airplane with gleaming wood-panelled interiors and plush leather seats, which takes him every morning from Delhi to the starting point of the days campaign trail.        
	He then hops on to a Bell 412 helicopter, a specially designed nine-seat VIP version, which criss-crosses Indias hinterland  touching down periodically amid great clouds of dust in some nondescript town or rural settlement  to campaign relentlessly in what is probably the last and most significant election of his life.        
	But as he gazes down from the comfort of the chopper at the alluvial expanse of the Indo-Gangetic plain  fallow fields dotted with neat bundles of this seasons harvest, the great river lying languid before the monsoon rains, village clusters soporific beneath the summers haze  modern Indias best-known charioteer confesses that he does miss the old rath.        
	I would any day prefer a road journey. The kind of communication in that is qualitatively different  there you go out to the people, here it is the people who come to you, he says.        
	The response to his public meetings (he has addressed close to a hundred rallies in as many Lok Sabha constituencies since he began the poll campaign on February 5 and there are still three weeks to go) has been good. But in public meetings, the bulk of people are those who support you; but in the case of a rathyatra you are going to villages and meeting people it makes a big difference.        
	His rathyatras, he hastens to add, were never used for election campaigns but only for specific purposes. But even election campaigns in the good old days meant long road journeys, arduous but exhilarating.        
	Advani, who makes it a point to mention at every rally that he has participated in every general election since 1952 either as worker or candidate, slips easily into nostalgic mode. In the earlier years, we never had the luxury of aircraft or helicopters. Once I had gone from Kota to Chittor in Rajasthan, a journey of some eight hours, in a tractor trolley because nothing else was available.        
	And it was again in Rajasthan, in 1977 or 78 when I was a minister in Morarjis cabinet, that the taxi we hired broke down and Lalit Kishore Chaturvedi (BJP leader in the state) flagged down a truck and told the driver that I was a cabinet minister and asked for a lift to our destination, he recalls.        
	It is not just the mode of transport that has changed. After the arrival of television, the size of public meetings, especially in urban areas, has started shrinking, Advani says, almost preparing us in advance for the modest crowds that await him at the small town of Jalaun which is the first stop on the days chopper tour of the Bundelkhand region of Uttar Pradesh.        
	And we soon discover that if Advani misses his road yatras of yore, the BJPs support base misses the erstwhile rathyatri even more.        
	Shrill cries of Jai Shri Ram greet him at every rally but the man who once polarised the entire nation on that slogan refuses to get swayed. The BJPs Prime Minister-in-waiting is determined to stick to his new script  no emotive issues, no mention of subjects that could alienate present partners or potential allies, no harking back to a past that could threaten his future.        
	His speeches are peppered with mujhe smaran hain (I remember) but it is a selective memory. He recalls the first general election of 1952 when Syama Prasad Mookerjee fought for the right to hoist the Tricolour in Jammu and Kashmir. And then jump cuts to 1997, dwelling on his own Swarn Jayanti Yatra when he travelled the length of India to highlight that we got swaraj 50 years ago but we have yet to get suraaj (good governance). And then to the six-year rule of the NDA from 1998 to 2004 when we delivered on all the promises we made  making India a nuclear power, focusing on development and infrastructure, granting the long-pending demand for smaller states, and giving an overall sense of optimism and well-being to the people of India.        
	It is a speech that evokes little enthusiasm among people who once went delirious at the sight of the Ram rathyatra and were inspired by the greatest mass movement since Independence (to use Advanis own expression before he discovered the virtues of Jinnah and the imperatives of a moderate image)  inspired enough to demolish the Babri Masjid and polarise the politics of the state and the nation.        
	As Advani goes on and on with his speech that seems a mix of secondary school history, civics and moral science, many in the crowd prefer to turn away from the stage and stare in wonderment at the helicopter instead.        
	By the time he reaches his last meeting of the day in the small town of Hardoi, Advani finally relents  but only a little. As cries of Jai Shri Ram get raised again and again, he says there is already a Ram temple in Ayodhya but a grand temple must come up there. And then quickly adds that the BJP, like Mahatma Gandhi, wants a Ram Rajya in India  a term that connotes an ideal government, an ideal system. Its too vague and anodyne a vision to excite an audience that grew up on a more rabid, divisive diet.        
	Local and state BJP leaders we meet in course of the day are confident that the party will get many more seats from Uttar Pradesh this time than in 2004. The reasons are many  the shift of Brahmins away from the Bahujan Samaj Party, the division of the Muslim vote three ways, price rise, the Varun factor. But Advani, who delivered Uttar Pradesh to the party in the early nineties, is not one of them.        
	That seems to suit the new, improved Advani fine. The trouble is, no matter how hard he tries to become a latter-day Vajpayee, his image remains frozen as the hardline rathyatri for supporters and adversaries alike.

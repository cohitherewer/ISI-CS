	Cuttack, March 18: The Orissa Cricket Association (OCA) has set terms to host IPL matches although official confirmation is yet to be received here about any Deccan Chargers ties at the Barabati Stadium.        
	The IPL organiser, as per the OCA decision, will have to give 40 per cent of the tickets  proposed to be made available online  on direct cash payment basis to the association. We also want 2,000 complimentary passes. If the two preconditions do not work out, the IPL organiser or franchisee can move to any other venue, said OCA secretary Asirbad Behera.        
	OCAs decision has come at a time when the IPL organising committee had submitted a fresh proposal, resetting certain dates and identifying new venues, to the Union home ministry. According to sources, there would be no matches in Jaipur, Delhi and Visakhapatnam. Among the neutral venues, Ahmedabad, Nagpur, Dharamsala and Cuttack will host matches of Delhi Daredevils and Deccan Chargers.        
	Behera, however, said he was yet to be contacted by any of the IPL franchisees after inclusion of Cuttack among the new venues.        
	We are ready to host IPL matches if they are scheduled, taking into consideration the security factor so that it does not hamper the election process, Behera said.         
	Lok Sabha and Assembly elections are scheduled for April 18 and 23 in the state.         
	But a final decision on the IPL match will be taken only after the state governments approval, he added.         
	The police were also unaware of any move from the Union home ministry for IPL matches in Cuttack. I am yet to receive any communication or query on security related to IPL matches, director-general of police Manmohan Praharaj said.        
	He, however, refused to comment on security for IPL matches before receiving any official confirmatuon.        
	Raipur pitch fit        
	A three-member expert committee of the IPL, headed by tournament director Dhiraj Malhotra, visited the international cricket stadium in Parsada, about 20km from Raipur in Chhattisgarh, today.         
	The condition of pitch and ground are fit for the matches, said Daljit Singh, the BCCI ground and pitch committee chairman. The only minor technical fault that the experts pointed out was that the pitch was wet and required regular play.

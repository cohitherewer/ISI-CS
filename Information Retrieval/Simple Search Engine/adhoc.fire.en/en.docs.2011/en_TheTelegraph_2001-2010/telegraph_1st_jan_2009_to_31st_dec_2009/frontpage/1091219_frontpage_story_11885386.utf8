The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Old fault-lines fail summit

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            A journalist draws a cartoon while waiting at a news conference in Copenhagen on Friday. (AFP)                                  
	Dec. 18: Long-standing differences in positions have prevented the Copenhagen summit from failing to yield the accord to fight climate change that India and virtually all developing countries had sought.        
	The leaders, ministers and negotiators from some 192 countries struggled through the day to generate a political statement, the Copenhagen Accord, that is expected to guide more negotiations and action in the coming months.        
	Disagreements over unresolved, contentious issues  the levels of greenhouse gas emission reductions by industrialised countries, details of the review process for emission-curbing actions by developing countries, and the source of long-term climate finance from the rich countries to the developing countries  continued to linger during the final hours of the summit.        
	The outcome may well fall short of expectations, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had said this morning at an informal plenary of the heads of state and governments at the summit.        
	The European Union has offered to cut emissions by 20 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020, and has offered to raise this to 30 per cent if the US and China also do more to curb emissions. The US has offered 17 per cent reduction from the 2005 level by 2020. The EU, Japan and the US have all pledged finance to help the developing countries deal with climate change.        
	But all emission-curbing actions pledged so far are likely to lead to a 3.9C rise in the global average temperature rather than limit the rise to 2C as science demands. India and other developing countries and environmental groups want the industrialised countries to cut emissions by 25 per cent to 40 per cent by 2020, a key requirement to help prevent global temperatures from rising beyond 2C.        
	Differences over the legal architecture of emission cuts also remain unresolved. The developing countries have been seeking the continuation of the 12-year-old Kyoto Protocol, which imposes legally binding emission cuts on industrialised countries but not on developing countries.        
	Under the Bali Action Plan formulated two years ago, the developing countries are expected to initiate domestic emission-curbing actions with funds and technology from the industrialised countries.        
	The Kyoto Protocol should continue to stand as a valid legal instrument, Singh said. Parties to the Protocol should deliver on their solemn commitments. It would go against international public opinion if we acquiesce in its replacement by a new and weaker set of commitments.        
	The industrialised countries want to replace the Kyoto Protocol with a new legal instrument that would demand greater emission-curbing actions from the developing countries as well as introduce international scrutiny even on their domestic emission-curbing actions.        
	Singh said India had agreed to take on a voluntary target of reducing the emission intensity by around 20 per cent below the 2005 level by 2020. We will deliver on this goal regardless of the outcome of this conference, he said.        
	The US and Europe also want large emitters such as India and China to open domestic emission-curbing actions to international scrutiny. But the mechanisms through which this could be done  another contentious issue  is still under debate.

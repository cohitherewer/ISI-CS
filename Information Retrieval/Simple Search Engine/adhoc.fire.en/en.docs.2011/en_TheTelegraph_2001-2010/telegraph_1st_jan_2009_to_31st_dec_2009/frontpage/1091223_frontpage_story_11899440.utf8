          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 22: The gender gap in tobacco use in India has narrowed.        
	While more men consume tobacco products than women, girls appear to be catching up with boys, a two-city study has suggested.        
	Earlier research had indicated tobacco consumption in India is about 11 times more common among adult men than among adult women. But the new study by an India-US team has found much smaller differences among school students.        
	The study, which examined tobacco use among 11,642 students from Classes 6 to 8 chosen from 32 schools in Delhi and Chennai, found little differences in the rates of cigarette smoking between boys and girls  2 per cent of boys, and 1.7 per cent of girls.        
	Although the use of all tobacco products was consistently lower among girls than among boys, the differences were much smaller than observed among adults in India. Four in 10 boys and three in 10 girls chewed tobacco. The findings appear this month in the journal Nicotine and Tobacco Research.        
	We believe this is a sign of changing patterns of tobacco use -- more and more young girls appear to be taking up tobacco, said Monika Arora, director of Hriday, a non-goverment agency in New Delhi, and lead author of the study. Its findings appear this month in the journal Nicotine and Tobacco Research.        
	The researchers believe the findings underline the need for targeted gender-specific programmes to coax young people to stay away from tobacco. Current campaigns on tobacco are for both sexes.        
	The study has suggested that exposure to tobacco advertisements is a greater risk factor for tobacco consumption for girls than for boys. It is possible that girls are likely to be more strongly influenced by advertisements than boys, Arora said.

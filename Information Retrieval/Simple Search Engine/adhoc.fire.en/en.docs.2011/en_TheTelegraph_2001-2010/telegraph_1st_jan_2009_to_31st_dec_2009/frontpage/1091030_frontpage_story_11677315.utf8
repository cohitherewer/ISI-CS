	Oct. 29: Two brothers associated with the Trinamul Congress were gunned down in West Midnapore by suspected Maoists this evening in the middle of a brawl between the CPM and Mamata Banerjee over alleged nexus with the rebels.        
	Jaladbaran Kar, 45, and Ashis, 40, were shot dead in Belpahari in the first multiple murders of Trinamul activists by alleged Maoists. Jaladbaran was a state committee member of Trinamul, while his younger brother was a party worker.        
	Jaladbaran was a prosperous farmer as well as a contractor and his younger brother was a ration dealer. The brothers were dragged out of their homes and shot by four armed men. The killers then disappeared into a nearby forest.        
	The Maoist leadership denied a hand. But police are viewing the rebels as prime suspects because Belpahari is a known Maoist stronghold and the brothers were facing corruption charges.        
	Suspected Maoists also killed two CPM supporters elsewhere in West Midnapore. A Trinamul worker was killed in clashes with the CPM in Bankura, pushing up the total toll in the past 24 hours to five.        
	Mamata has been trying to distance herself from the Maoists, which is suspected to have prompted the rebels to block a Rajdhani Express on Tuesday to send her a message.        
	After the killings today, Mamata said the Marxists and Maoists were twins. They are two sides of the same coin, she added.        
	She iterated the demand  articulated first on Tuesday  for army deployment in Maoist-infested areas of Bengal and charged chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee with being indulgent towards the Maoists.         
	Late tonight, Maoist leader Kishanji said: We have not carried out the killing. It is the work of CPM harmads.         
	 The CPM state secretariat met this evening in the presence of Bhattacharjee to mount pressure on the Centre to investigate the Mamata-Maoist nexus. The connivance is now more clear as the railways chose not to name anybody in the FIR lodged about the train blockade, said CPM leader Mohammad Salim.        
	Villagers said that a few months ago, the Maoists had put up posters in Belpahari, warning Trinamul workers against corruption.         
	The charges against Jaladbaran ranged from cutting corrupt deals as a contractor to settling disputes for money. Ashis, who was the secretary of a school, was accused of taking money for recruiting Group D staff.        
	Last month, Maoists had killed Nishikanta Mandal, the Trinamul gram panchayat pradhan in East Midnapore, accusing him of corruption. Mamata had blamed that murder also on the CPM.

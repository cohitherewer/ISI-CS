                                                                                                           Bengal slips on gender parity, rises on power 
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 13: India has improved gender equality and empowerment by over 10 per cent each over the past decade, but traditional laggard states remain virtually stagnant, the Centres first ever official quantitative rating of gender development has revealed.        
	Kerala has lost its tag as the countrys most gender-equal state to Chandigarh, while women in Andhra Pradesh are the most empowered, the study commissioned by the women and child development ministry has said.        
	Bengal is ranked 24th out of 35 states on the gender equity index and 16th on the womens empowerment measure for 2006.        
	It has dropped down the gender equity ranking from 19th in 1996, but has risen in the empowerment index rankings from 26th a decade back.        
	The study, conducted with assistance from the United Nations Development Programme, calculated gender inequality and womens empowerment by tweaking  for Indian conditions  parameters commonly used by the UNDP.        
	The report, yet to be unveiled officially, compares the 2006 and 1996 reports of gender disparity and womens empowerment in each Indian state using data from the two years  and then ranks the states.        
	Kerala was ranked first in the gender development index (GDI) calculated in the report for 1996  a ranking consistent with the annual GDI ratings by the UNDP for the same period.        
	But the southern state has slipped to the third place in the GDI calculated for 2006, behind Chandigarh and Goa.        
	The Indian governments GDI is calculated by comparing the infant mortality, life expectancy at the age of one, literacy rates, average years of education and estimated income per capita for girls and boys.        
	As a country, Indias GDI has improved from 0.568 in 1996 to 0.633 in 2006. The higher the GDI, the greater the gender equality.        
	Andhra Pradesh has jumped from the 14th rank in 1996 to top the 2006 gender empowerment measure (GEM) calculated by researchers in the report. Goa, which topped the GEM for 1996, ranks second in the 2006 report.        
	The GEM is calculated by measuring political and economic participation and control wielded by women in different Indian states. Like the GDI, a higher GEM represents greater empowerment of women.        
	Political participation is calculated by taking into consideration the number of women legislators  at the Centre, Assembly and the panchayati raj institutions  and the number of women candidates fielded by parties in elections.        
	The percentage of women voters is also considered while computing the political participation of women.        
	Economic participation has been calculated by evaluating the share of jobs held by women in the civil services, of professionals graduating from medical and engineering colleges and judges of high courts and the Supreme Court.        
	Haryana and Kerala are ranked third and fourth, respectively, on the GEM index for 2006, while Pondicherry and Maharashtra are tied for the fifth slot.        
	Bihar is at the bottom of both the GDI and GEM indices  for both 1996 and 2006. The state government has, however, since enforced 50 per cent reservations in panchayats for women, which may help the state improve its GEM the next time the index is measured.

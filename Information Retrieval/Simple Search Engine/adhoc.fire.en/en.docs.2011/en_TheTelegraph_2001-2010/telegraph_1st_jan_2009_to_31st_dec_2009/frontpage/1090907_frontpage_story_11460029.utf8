The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | BJP MLAs quit in poll push 
                                                                                                           BJP MLAs quit in poll push 
          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                              
	Ranchi, Sept. 6: A day after the BJPs core committee took a quit resolution, party MLAs today resigned en masse to mount pressure on the Centre for early Assembly elections in the state.        
	Its NDA partner, the JD(U), is also planning to follow suit.        
	The MLAs  who tendered their resignation to state party president Raghubar Das  also plan to meet President Pratibha Patil, demanding early House polls apparently buoyed by the overwhelming response it received in the Lok Sabha elections in the state.        
	The BJP core committee had yesterday decided that party MLAs should quit in protest against the Union governments decision to sit over the election issue.        
	Stating that the decision had prior approval of the partys central leadership, Das said he had received the resignations of all 21 party MLAs. We will submit it to the Speaker as soon as we get a nod from the BJP parliamentary board, he said. The board is meeting on Monday evening, he added.        
	Das said that home minister P. Chidambaram had cheated on the people by going back on his statement in Parliament to hold elections after monsoon and so they were forced to take the step.         
	The Congress, however, said the mass resignation proved that the BJP was upset over good governance under Presidents rule. AICC spokesman Abhishek Manu Singhvi said: Everyone knows Jharkhand elections will be held by December. The BJP is indulging in political melodrama as it is scared of good governance.        
	Das shot back saying the BJP would rally on October 11 to expose the misdeeds under Presidents rule.        
	Meanwhile, state JD(U) president Jaleshwar Mahto said he had apprised party chief Sharad Yadav of the BJPs decision. There is no justification for the MLAs to remain members of such a House who had no business to discharge, he said. The JD(U) has three members.        
	CPI demand        
	The CPI has demanded that the advisory council be scrapped and replaced by an all-party panel to ensure effective administration. CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan said in Ranchi that the IAS-dominated council was completely de-linked from people.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                    
	Calcutta, Aug. 6: Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi tonight blamed the continuing post-election clashes in the state on those who can act but are not doing so, describing the bloodletting as a veritable tandava of political violence.        
	When the leading political formations of West Bengal have the same objective, why should violence not abate? the governor asked in a media statement issued well past 10pm.        
	Gandhi himself offered the answer: Because, I believe, those who can act are not doing so.        
	By those who can act, the governor could be implying the leadership of the leading political formations mentioned in his statement.        
	But the government will find it difficult to distance itself from the label of those who can act as the executive is entrusted with the task of acting to maintain law and order and protect lives.        
	A paragraph down the line, the governor has made a virtual call for action by the State, couching the nudge in the phrase I am confident.        
	The State too will, I am confident, (i) move swiftly to check the phenomenon of illicit arms; (ii) act to rapidly bring the perpetrators of violence to account; and (iii) instil confidence among the people that their politics and their security are not linked, the governor said in the statement.        
	The Opposition has been alleging that arms are being stockpiled by CPM supporters and the police did not take action against those who chased Congress MLAs in Burdwans Mangalkot, where Section 144 was imposed in five villages a few hours before the governors statement.        
	In words that capture the enormity of the tragedy unfolding in what Union home minister P. Chidambaram described as killing fields of Bengal, the governor said: Not a day passes without someone somewhere being killed for his politics. The widows wail rends each day.        
	Striking a non-partisan chord, Gandhi pointed out that the responsibility to identify the violent within their own organisations and leave them to be dealt by the law lies with all political leaders, right across party divides.        
	The governor issued the statement following visits by legislators of not only the Congress and the Trinamul Congress but also of the Left Front that asked him to extend co-operation to the government in all possible ways for the protection of life, property and democratic rights of the people of the state.        
	In his response to the Front appeal, too, the governor sent a message to all. I have done so (extend co-operation to protect life) in the past and consider it to be my duty to do so again and again. I believe that all of us must do our duty.        
	Unlike March 14, 2007, when Gandhi said the police firing in Nandigram has filled me with a sense of cold horror, the governor today appeared to apportion the blame on all political parties.        
	Three fires burn in the political life of our state: of fear, of the agony of bereavement, of rage, Gandhi said. It becomes the duty of our states political leaders to tell their followers and supporters that they must stamp out these fires. It becomes their duty to see that none provokes nor gets provoked.        
	The CPM, which had criticised the governor earlier, chose to exercise restraint tonight, saying a statement would be issued tomorrow.

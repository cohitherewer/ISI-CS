          STAFF REPORTER                               
	Pune, Aug 10 (PTI): The Maharashtra Government today ordered closure of schools and colleges in Pune, where swine flu has claimed three lives so far.              
	 quot;All schools, colleges and private coaching classes in Pune and neighbouring Pimpri-Chinchwad would remain closed for seven days, quot; district guardian minister Ajit Pawar told reporters here.              
	 quot;We will compensate for the gap by reducing Diwali holidays by a week, quot; he said.              
	Schools and colleges should use the weeks period to get their premises disinfected and sterilised, Pawar said.              
	On the three H1N1 deaths in Pune, Pawar said, quot;Had the patients been given immediate treatment, they could have been saved. They were admitted to the government hospitals very late, after first going to private hospitals. quot;              
	Three swine flu patients in Punes Sassoon hospital are in critical condition, he said.

	Bhubaneswar/Jamshedpur, Feb. 28: Maoists blew up a railway station and abducted two officials from another station early this morning in Sundergarh district about 30km from the Jharkhand border.        
	However, no casualties were reported although the abducted railway officials could not be traced till this evening.        
	The serial strikes came on a day Maoists were observing a 24-hour bandh in Orissa, Jharkhand, Bihar and Bengal demanding release of their leaders, namely         
	Rajiv (alias Abdul or Atul), a self-styled Deogarh- Sundergarh zonal commander, and Ashutosh, a central committee member and Deogarh-Sambalpur-Sundargarh zone deputy commander both of whom were detained recently.        
	According to an eyewitness, about 100 armed Maoists, including six women, attacked the Bhalulata railway station, 25km from Rourkela, shouting lal salaam around 3.30am.         
	They detained Bhalulata station master Maheswar Pradhan and porters Khageswar Mahato and Jhiriga Oramon before triggering explosions using improvised explosive devices (IED).         
	The entire building  including the ticket counter, control room and the signal panel system  collapsed under the impact of the blast.        
	Pradhan said the rebels first asked them to vacate the building. Then they tied our hands and took us to a place about 1km away. Suddenly, we heard a deafening sound. Minutes later we were released, he said.        
	The station was severely damaged with parts of windows and doors blown around 100 metres away.         
	Senior police and railway officials rushed to the spot with sniffer dogs to check railway tracks for landmines. Combing operations in the nearby forest is on, said Rourkela superintendent of police Santos Bala.        
	At Chandiposh, about 30km from Rourkela, 50-odd Maoists abducted the station master, S.K. Singh, and his assistant, Samir Mukherjee. Neither of them had been traced till late evening.         
	Todays attack disrupted train services on the Tatanagar-Rourkela route.         
	The Sambalpur-Howrah Ispat Express and the Tata-Durg were cancelled while South Bihar Express was terminated at the Tatanagar railway station.

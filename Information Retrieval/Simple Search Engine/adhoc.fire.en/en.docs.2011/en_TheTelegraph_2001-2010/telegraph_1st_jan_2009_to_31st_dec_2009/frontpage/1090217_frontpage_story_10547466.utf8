	Calcutta, Feb. 16: Not one but three young men from reputable colleges in Calcutta repeatedly raped a 21-year-old engineering student in a Santoshpur flat after she was called over for a get-together and drugged, according to a police complaint filed by the girl.        
	Accounts by the girls relatives and lawyers of the alleged assault on the intervening night between February 8 and 9 suggested depravity rarely reported before in the city.         
	The girl, apparently served cold drink laced with sedatives, said she woke up without her clothes on in the Santoshpur flat with the men, two of whom she had become friends with on her trips to the city.         
	Then they confined her in the flat till the morning and raped her repeatedly before dropping her off at her mess in Sonarpur, said a lawyer for the girl who later returned to her parents in Malda. She is still in a state of shock but has decided to fight the case till the end. Thats why she has returned to Calcutta and lodged a complaint.        
	Tanmoy Mayukh Borai, Rishin Sengupta and Saptarshi Sanyal were produced in the Alipore additional chief judicial magistrates court today and sent to judicial custody till March 2.        
	Doctors conducted a medical examination on the girl, a student of a private engineering college, who reached MR Bangur hospital a little after noon accompanied by her mother and some relatives.        
	By late evening, hospital authorities had sent a report to the police. The police refused to reveal details of the report, which experts said might not be conclusive in proving rape as seven days had passed since the alleged assault.        
	Malda police chief Satyajit Banerjee said a test had been conducted on the girl after she first approached them last Friday  five days after February 8 night. We referred her to Jadavpur East police as the incident took place there. But we carried out a medical test on the girl to assist the investigation, Banerjee said. The report is yet to reach the police.         
	A close relative of the girl told The Telegraph Tanmoy, Rishin and Saptarshi invited her to Tanmoys Lake East Road flat. She had met Tanmoy and Saptarshi on her trips from Malda to Calcutta as they were from Siliguri. She became friends with them and accepted their invitation after she was told that two other girls had also been invited, the relative said.         
	But see what those friends did to her. She is so traumatised she can barely speak. We are lucky she is alive, the relative added, waiting outside the gynaecology department at Bangur hospital.        
	According to the police complaint, Tanmoy called her up last Sunday morning and invited her to the get-together. Later in the day, he, Saptarshi and Rishin picked her up from her mess around 5, the complaint said.        
	After reaching the flat, she asked about the other guests. They told her to relax and offered her a cold drink, following which she lost consciousness, the girls lawyer said.        
	Lawyers representing the girl today told the court she regained consciousness around 10.30 but her violators kept her confined till 5.30 in the morning and took turns at raping her before dropping her off at the mess.         
	A relative said she took a train to Malda that morning. She didnt talk to anyone for almost two days. Then she broke down and told her mother what had happened. We want the strictest punishment for these boys.

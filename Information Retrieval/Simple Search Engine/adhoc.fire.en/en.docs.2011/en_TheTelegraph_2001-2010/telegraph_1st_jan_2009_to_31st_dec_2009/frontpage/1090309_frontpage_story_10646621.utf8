The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Kabul tops Delhi menu for Clinton
                                                                                                           Kabul tops Delhi menu for Clinton
          K.P. NAYAR                             Menon                                  
	Washington, March 8: Foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon, who arrived here today for three days of intensive engagement of the new Obama administration, will seek to fill gaps in secretary of state Hillary Clintons world view after she travelled 92,710.4km across the globe in 16 days from February 15 till this weekend, with a break of six days in between.        
	At the top of Menons long list of items to be discussed with Clinton, her deputy James Steinberg, undersecretary of state for political affairs William Burns, special envoy Richard Holbrooke and an unseen but highly influential non-administration presence on South Asia, Bruce Riedel, will be the vexing problem of Afghanistan.        
	The Obama administration is engaged in a review of its Afghanistan policy, but so far the effort has been like the blind men in the ancient Indian tale who are trying to describe an elephant.         
	As Menon sits down tomorrow for his first round of talks here, it will be a matter of concern in New Delhi that President Barack Obama today held out the possibility of a reconciliation between America and the so-called moderate elements of the Taliban.         
	In an interview to The New York Times, Obama flat out said no in answer to a question whether the US was winning the war in Afghanistan.        
	External affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee has cautioned against any accommodation with the Taliban and Delhis concern will be that such an enterprise will allow Pakistan the strategic depth it has sought in Afghanistan with predictable consequences for the continuing cross-border terrorism against India.         
	The two sides will review progress on the investigation of the attacks in Mumbai last November and Pakistans cooperation on this front.        
	Menon will have meetings with senior officials of the Pentagon, the National Security Council and key senators and members of the House of Representatives.         
	Menons talks with Burns will provide the first indication of how the Obama administration intends to proceed with the nuclear deal which it was bequeathed by former President George W. Bush.         
	To set the stage for this test, Menon wrote to Burns in advance of his trip seeking dates for the first round of negotiations between India and the US on reprocessing spent nuclear fuel.        
	Sources privy to the chatter at the state departments bureau of non-proliferation here said the bureau had advised Burns to be legal and correct, but non-committal in any great detail in responding to Menons letter.        
	This is because Clinton is yet to fully staff this bureau, which will have decisive inputs into the sensitive talks. It is likely that Obama will nominate die-hard non-proliferationists to this bureau who are expected to give India a hard time at the talks because they have been opposed to the nuclear deal while they were outside the government under Republican rule.        
	But Menon will have the satisfaction of reminding those here who may flag the nuclear deal during his talks that the International Atomic Energy Agency approved a few days ago Indias additional protocol to its safeguards agreement with the agency, a condition for going ahead with the deal.         
	Pentagon officials are expected to make out a strong case for concluding the so-called end-user agreement with India which will allow Americans at will to inspect military equipment purchased from the US.         
	There is intense opposition to the agreement from Indias men in uniform and influential sections of the political leadership, including defence minister A.K. Antony. Without the agreement, military sales between India and the US are likely to stagnate notwithstanding the increase in bilateral defence cooperation.

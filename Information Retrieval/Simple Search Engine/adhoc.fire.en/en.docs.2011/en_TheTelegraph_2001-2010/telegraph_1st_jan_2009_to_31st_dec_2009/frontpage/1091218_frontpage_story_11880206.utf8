          SUMAN K SHRIVASTAVA                                     
	Ranchi, Dec. 17: Babulal Marandi left for New Delhi today to attend the last few days of the ongoing Parliament session but set in motion the clamour for a non-tribal chief minister, a clever ploy to woo the primarily non-tribal electorate that will vote in tomorrows final phase of election.        
	Of the 16 constituencies that vote tomorrow, bringing the curtains down on the month-long exercise, most are in Maoist strongholds, prompting the Election Commission to use webcams to monitor voting in seven sensitive polling booths in as many districts.        
	Today may have been a day of rest for politicians, but rival camps issued soundbytes to keep the tempo alive. If state BJP chief Raghubar Das said that the NDA was comfortably placed in the last phase, his Congress rival, Union minister and Ranchi MP Subodh Kant Sahay, went a step ahead and claimed the Congress-JVM combine would garner much more than the 41 seats required for a majority.        
	But yesterday, by stating that the Congress-JVM combine had no reservations about a non-tribal chief minister, JVM chief Marandi laid bare a debate that has been raging not just within the Congress, but also in the BJP.        
	Apart from the fact that 12 of the 16 constituencies have a large non-tribal voter base, Marandis public statement was a morale-booster for Sahay, who sees a real chance in grabbing the top post, especially since PCC chief Pradeep Balmuchus fate seems uncertain in Ghatshila.        
	In the BJP, the issue was first raised by Yashwant Sinha who said the debate over a tribal or non-tribal chief minister was irrelevant. What was more important was that the person chosen to lead the state should know how to govern, the Hazaribagh MP had said.         
	Apart from Sinha, other contenders for the top post were former chief minister Arjun Munda and state party chief Raghubar Das.        
	To prove his point that the Congress was staring at failure, BJPs Das said today that the partys youth mascot Rahul Gandhi hadnt returned to Jharkhand after campaigning for a day. Sonia Gandhi campaigned for only two days. Had there been an encouraging trend for the Congress they would have campaigned extensively, he argued.         
	JMM chief Shibu Soren, the partys lone star campaigner who addressed as many as 250 public meetings, remained confined to his official residence today.         
	Well emerge as the single largest party, said Hemant, his son and Rajya Sabha MP.        
	Sahay, also the Congresss campaign committee chairman, was confident the Congress-JVM alliance would be way ahead of the magic figure. The coalition will provide a stable and transparent government, he added.         
	Joint chief electoral officer Ashok Kumar Sinha, monitoring last minute details concerning tomorrows voting that would be held amid unprecedented security, said that the state administration was ready for tomorrows final phase.        
	He said the Election Commission and the chief electoral officer would monitor voting via webcams in seven polling stations in Palamau, West Singhbhum, Seraikela, Kharsawan, Chatra, Garhwa and Hazaribagh.         
	He said two ambulances were stationed in two helipads, one at RIMS and the other at Vikas Vidyalaya near Apollo Hospital. Ten doctors have been deputed round-the-clock in the emergency ward, said M K Rai, the director of RIMS.

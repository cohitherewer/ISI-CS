	Ranchi, Nov. 16: In their battle for one-upmanship, Jharkhands primary formations are holding on to their poll manifestos.         
	Both BJP and Congress are waiting for the other to release the manifesto, lest they miss out on making any promise to the electorate the other may have planned, though the first phase of polls is less than 10 days away.        
	The draft committees of both parties have apparently prepared the manifestos, but are waiting for an opportune moment to make them public, putting Babulal Marandis JVM in a fix. It now has to decide whether to release its manifesto alone or make joint promises with ally Congress.         
	Interestingly, the JMM, which failed to release its manifesto before the last Lok Sabha elections, pipped the others to the post by releasing their booklet yesterday.        
	Though the two main manifestos are yet to be released, there are enough indications they will include several populist measures to lure the voters. It is a crucial fight and at stake is the prestige of the high command. So we do not want to make any wrong move which may prove counter-productive, said J. P. Gupta, the convenor of the Congress manifesto committee.         
	Free food for BPL families, begun by Governor K. Sankaranarayanan, would be on top of the list. The central government has already decided to legislate a law on food security, he added.        
	The Congress will also be promising stability and a corruption free government in the state. State Congress president Pradeep Balmuchu, however, denied that the party was waiting for the BJP to make the first move. We will release it in a day or two. We are always the front-runners and not followers, he said.         
	The Congress factor apart, the BJP has other reasons for delaying the release of its manifesto. It was expected that Yashwant Sinha would release the manifesto yesterday. But Arjun Munda, the chairman of the election campaign committee, wants some big leader from New Delhi to release it, said a senior party leader. BJP spokesman Sanjay Seth, however, denied any rift within the party and said it would be released soon.        
	In 2005, the BJP had promised 60 per cent budget allocation for agriculture and village development. It had also promised a special plan to help bring Naxalites into the mainstream.         
	It had vowed to ensure availability of rice at the rate of Rs 3 per kg and wheat at Rs 2 for BPL families, besides salt for 25 paise for primitive tribes.               
	The BJP had also vowed to hold long-due panchayat elections by April and link all the 3,765 panchayats through the Internet. Interestingly, the party had also promised to limit the area of official homes of ministers and senior officers to 1,000 sq feet.

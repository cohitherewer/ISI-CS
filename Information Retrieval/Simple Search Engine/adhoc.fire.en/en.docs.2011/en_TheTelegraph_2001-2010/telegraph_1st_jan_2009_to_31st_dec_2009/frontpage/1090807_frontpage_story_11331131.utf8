The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Flowers or honey? Its all about money
                                                                                                           Flowers or honey? Its all about money
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                            A girl at an organic farm at Niathu garden in Dimapur                                  
	Kohima/New Delhi, Aug. 6: Honey and flowers should go hand in hand as symbols of love but in Nagaland, they are in conflict. The root cause, as always, is money.        
	The northeastern state plans to expand both its home-grown honey and flower industries, hoping to garner a slice of the world market and earn a packet. The problem is, officials say, it cannot do both at the same time.        
	Floriculture on a large scale would mean widespread use of pesticides, which would mean the honey from the nectar of such flowers would be considered inorganic.        
	However, the state wants to produce the rarer and costlier organic honey, and set up a Nagaland Honey and Bee Mission (NHBM) last year to implement and oversee the project.        
	To be certified organic, honey must be made from flowers grown without synthetic fertilisers, additives or pesticides such as sulfa compounds and antibiotics. Nor can carbolic acid be used to remove honey from the hive, or calcium cyanide to kill the bees before extracting the honey.        
	Nagaland now produces about 185 tonnes of organic honey a year. The NHBM is targeting 5,000 tonnes of organic honey by 2017 that could bring in Rs 130 crore, about a tenth of the plan money the state gets annually from Delhi, said state development commissioner Alemtemshi Jamir.        
	India produces 52,000 tonnes of organic honey and exports 15,000 tonnes, with China dominating the 1.4-million-tonne world market with exports of 300,000 tonnes.        
	However, as the NHBM prepares to gain the organic certification to clear the decks for rapid expansion, its objectives are threatened by the states concurrent plans to expand floriculture.        
	The two cannot go together, especially when the world over the honeybee population is dwindling because of pesticide use, said NHBM director Mathung Yanthan.        
	He added that whatever Nagaland might earn from an expanded floriculture industry could not match the returns from honey. The anthuriums of Kohima and roses of Mokokchung now sell in Mumbais markets but their export is almost nil.        
	Former horticulture secretary Thangi Mannen, however, argued that commercial floriculture is done in greenhouses that are out of bounds for bees  so the honey missions misgivings are unfounded.        
	But the NHBMs Yanthan said that when flowers are grown on a large scale across the state, it would be impossible to keep the bees away from them entirely. This could stand in the way of getting organic certification for the honey.        
	Other officials said that in floriculture, Nagaland would stand little chance against developed states like Karnataka that were backed by infrastructure and market links.        
	Honey, on the other hand, is a sweet alternative that can naturally develop in the rural landscape, development commissioner Jamir said.        
	Nagalands leading honey producer is the village of Nima in Kohima district. Its Angami Naga residents build apiaries by digging a trench and rearing honeybees on stone slabs and wood. The NHBM wants to promote organic honey through this traditional method, Yanthan said.

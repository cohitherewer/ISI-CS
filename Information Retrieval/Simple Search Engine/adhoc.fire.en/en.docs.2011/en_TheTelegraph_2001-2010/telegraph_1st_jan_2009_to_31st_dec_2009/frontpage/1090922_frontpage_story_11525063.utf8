The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Wheelchair pilots gift: wife who flies supplies to Siachen
                                                                                                           Wheelchair pilots gift: wife who flies supplies to Siachen
          GAJINDER SINGH                            Mitali and Yashdeep Dabass                                   
	Chandigarh, Sept. 21: He once kept the supply lines to Siachen working. Now she does.        
	And one day, they hope to fly together.        
	Squadron Leader Yashdeep Dabass was riding a motorcycle when a bus hit him near Chandigarh nine years ago, paralysing him from the waist down. He had just turned 23.        
	Confined to a wheelchair, the young pilot had no one but the air force to turn to. The air force too stepped in and then began the painful journey to a somewhat regular life, powered by his will to do something with his life.        
	The man who once flew sorties to Siachen on an AN-32 transport aircraft now had a desk job as adjutant to the 12 Wing.        
	Thanks to the air force, I never felt left out. They ensured I would be of some use. At first, it was excruciating to even think that I would not fly an aircraft again, Yashdeep said at his modest office at the Chandigarh airbase.        
	Then he met Mitali, who was doing her MSc in microbiology in Pune, where her father, an army colonel, was stationed. Yashdeeps father too had been in the army.        
	Meeting him changed my attitude towards life. It was enough for me to decide to join the air force as a pilot, said Mitali, who is now a flight lieutenant flying transport aircraft.         
	His grit, determination and belief in himself is enormous. But initially, we never thought we would get married.        
	While Yashdeep works in his office, Mitali keeps the forward lines in the north and northwest working. She flies an AN-32, the same aircraft I flew before the accident, Yashdeep said, sitting in his wheelchair.        
	The AN-32, a Russian plane known as Sutlej in the IAF, is a tough aircraft capable of withstanding hostile conditions.        
	Mitali has to rise early in the morning for her sorties and is back home by afternoon. I have to ensure he goes through his vigorous exercises regularly, she chuckled.        
	I learnt a lot about flying from Yashdeep. After completing my training I decided that if I had to marry someone, it would have to be him, Mitali said.        
	They married in 2007 just after Mitali had joined the air force. Initially I tried to talk her out of the proposal but she insisted it would have to be me or no one, Yashdeep said.        
	Yashdeep has to do four hours of gruelling exercises every day, which he does with Mitalis help. Doctors have told him he can overcome his disability if he exercises regularly, but it will take time.        
	Whatever he does, he does with vigour. And he is very meticulous. He sticks to his routines much like a pilot in the air does, Mitali said.        
	She added: Each time I step into my aircraft I have a mission to achieve. With him, my mission is to ensure he overcomes his pain. Its a joy to witness even the slightest improvement he makes.        
	They have a dream  to fly together in the same aircraft, carrying supplies to the forward lines. That day must come it will come, Mitali said softly, fist clenched.

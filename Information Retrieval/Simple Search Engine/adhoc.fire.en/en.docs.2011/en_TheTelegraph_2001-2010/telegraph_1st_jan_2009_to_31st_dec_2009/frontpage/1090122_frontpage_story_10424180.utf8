	Lucknow, Jan. 21: Kalyan Singh, during whose chief ministership the Babri Masjid was destroyed, today responded to a call of my heart and forged a bond with secularist Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav.        
	A day after quitting the BJP, Kalyan also declared he would campaign for the Samajwadis in the Lok Sabha elections.        
	His son Rajveer formally joined the party and was made a general secretary immediately.         
	During the Ayodhya movement of the eighties and early nineties, Kalyan and Mulayam were sworn enemies. After the mosques demolition, Mulayam had blamed Kalyan for dragging the nation to a communal flashpoint.         
	This morning, the Samajwadi chief and general secretary Amar Singh went to Kalyans Mall Avenue house in Lucknow to formally end the hostility.         
	Kalyans son responded by declaring at a news conference in the afternoon that he was now in the Samajwadi Party. Me and my father are now going to fight for the backward castes in Uttar Pradesh who found no place in the BJP, he added. Six BJP legislators quit the party today and rallied around Kalyan. More, he said, were likely to join him.        
	Kalyan said: It is a call of my heart that developed into a bond.         
	While walking out of the BJP, he had ruled out joining any party and kept options open for possible deals with Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, the Rajasthan veteran who has threatened to contest as an Independent, and BJP rebel Uma Bharti to embarrass his former party. Mulayams new-found friendship is bound to embarrass the Congress, which has been eyeing an alliance with his party.        
	Amar  who wants a share of Lodh votes, which Kalyan controls, without being burdened with the stigma of being associated with the Ayodhya-tainted man  denied a formal agreement with Kalyan. It is only a selfless, friendly understanding, nothing else, he said.        
	It was not immediately clear which constituency the Samajwadi Party would offer Rajveer. Sources said it could be Kannauj, near Etawah. The MP there, Mulayams son Akhilesh, is likely to contest from another seat.         
	Samajwadi sources said the party might eventually decide to withdraw its candidate from Etah in support of Kalyan.         
	There was probably a tinge of loneliness when Kalyan revealed today that his hearts call was towards Mulayam. His confidante, Kusum Rai, announced in the morning that she would not quit the BJP. My and Kalyan Singhs ways are different, said Kusum, who had been made a BJP Rajya Sabha member last year at Kalyans insistence.

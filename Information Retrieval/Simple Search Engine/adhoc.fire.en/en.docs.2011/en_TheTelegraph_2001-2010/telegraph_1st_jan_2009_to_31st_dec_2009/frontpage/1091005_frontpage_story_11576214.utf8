The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Mamatas power play goes on blink

	Calcutta, Oct. 4: The National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) has conveyed to the railways it wont fund a 1,000MW plant in Purulia, leaving Mamata Banerjee with the unpalatable option of tapping the private sector.         
	Railway ministry officials said the NTPC had informed the railways that it would only supply technology and build the plant and would not be an investor.         
	The railway ministry is not in a position to commit as much as Rs 5,000 crore to set up the thermal power plant on railway land at Adra in Purulia, a backward district.         
	They (NTPC) are sending their officials across for site inspection and technical discussions, but when it comes to investment, their position is clear  no, a Railway Board official said.        
	Only a directive from the Prime Ministers level can make the NTPC reconsider. However, the ground realities do not call for such intervention at this point.         
	Sensing Mamatas predicament, several private power players like Anil Ambanis Reliance, Hemant Kanorias Srei and Prasoon Mukherjees Universal have put in joint venture proposals.         
	After processing, a committee headed by Ficcis Amit Mitra has forwarded them to the ministry. However, Mamata is unable to respond favourably to the private investors for three reasons.         
	First, if she chooses to opt for a private player, she will be seen as forsaking her budget announcement of the project. The railways have already taken the initiative of setting up a power plant in collaboration with NTPC. We propose to set up a 1,000MW power plant at Adra to avail traction supply at economical tariff she had informed Parliament.         
	Sources said her key advisers, aware of the cost implications of a capital-intensive plant, wanted her to keep open a provision for private role in her statement but a combination of intra-ministry power play, Trinamuls socialistic outlook and bureaucratic short sight led to its exclusion.         
	Second, having taken a position on the floor of the House, Mamata cannot shift the thrust from public to private sector without first moving a requisite amendment. Once it is done, she will be required to float a tender inviting bids.         
	Third, from Mamatas standpoint, any dilution of the original plan will expose her to attacks from the CPM, a party she has been accusing of coddling the private sector. Ordinarily, there should not have been any problem in modifying her position and getting the race opened up to the private sector, said a Trinamul leader.         
	But at this stage, she does not want to do anything that may come into conflict with her image.         
	Mamata is also wary of the possible impact on her populist image if private players try to negotiate a tariff arrangement, to ensure adequate return on their investments, that is perceived as too high.         
	Once the private partner organises that kind of investment, it will be difficult for her or the railways to resist pressure either for a favourable tariff or construction of a plant with a low life span that comes with the use of, say, Chinese equipment, a senior official said.         
	After coming to know that railway land in Purulia will not be readily available, Anil Ambanis Reliance has proposed to underwrite the plants construction on 2,000 acres in neighbouring Bankura, the sources said.         
	The Srei group, too, has offered land and funds. Mukherjees Universal, now careful about not highlighting its old association with Indonesias Salim Group on account of Mamatas reservations against its projects in Bengal on political grounds, is believed to have cited its power venture in Gujarat among its credentials.

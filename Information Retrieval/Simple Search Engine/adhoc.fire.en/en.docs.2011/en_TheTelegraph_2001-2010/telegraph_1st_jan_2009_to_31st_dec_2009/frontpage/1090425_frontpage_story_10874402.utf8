The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Taliban? India plays fiddle
                                                                                                           Taliban? India plays fiddle
          K.P. NAYAR                      Pakistani Taliban militants have begun to withdraw from the north-western district of Buner as the army reinforced expectations of an imminent offensive in the Swat Valley.
                          
	Washington, April 24: No one knows if national security adviser M.K. Narayanan and foreign secretary Shivshankar Menon carried a little fiddle in the limited hand baggage they took on their short trip to Colombo today, but if they did, it would have been emblematic of the UPA governments current neighbourhood policy.        
	Having surrendered New Delhis regional role in Sri Lanka to a donors group made up largely of western powers and then done little to avoid the present crisis since Colombo ended its ceasefire with Tamil Tigers 15 long months ago, South Block is now fiddling, Nero-style, in the south even as the real fire is spreading across Indias northern borders in Pakistan.        
	There is alarm in Washington over a creeping Taliban takeover of Pakistan and White House press secretary Robert Gibbs acknowledged yesterday that developments in Islamabad were taking a lot of President Barack Obamas time.         
	Obama held a crisis meeting yesterday with Vice-President Joe Biden, secretary of state Hillary Clinton and special envoy for Pakistan and Afghanistan Richard Holbrooke.        
	The White House has asked Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and Afghanistans President Hamid Karzai to be in Washington on May 6 and 7 for a trilateral summit with Obama to discuss the deteriorating situation in the region.        
	The chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, on his third visit to Pakistan and Afghanistan in as many weeks, said today that we are certainly moving closer to the tipping point of a militant takeover of Pakistan.        
	The military chiefs assessment came on the heels of Clintons testimony on Capitol Hill that the Zardari government was basically abdicating to the Taliban.        
	The expectation here is that in the White House meeting, to be held in a fortnight, Zardari will focus on threats from India as the main reason for his inability to concentrate on the fight against the Taliban within Pakistan and across the border in Afghanistan.        
	Holbrooke has already asked India to pull back troops from the border with Pakistan.        
	His request, made when Indias foreign secretary was in Washington in March, prompted Menon to remark to his colleagues in his delegation that if his next meeting with Holbrooke was on similar lines, it would be the last such meeting, according to an official privy to the remark.        
	Undeterred, Holbrooke suggested in New Delhi this month that India must consider shutting down some of its consulates in Afghanistan and be a benign power there.        
	The biggest immediate challenge, not only to Indian diplomacy but also to national security, is in Pakistan and Afghanistan and Narayanan and Menon ought to be in Washington writing at least part of the script on Indias northern neighbours.        
	Instead, with Tamil Nadus 39 Lok Sabha seats in consideration, the UPA government has sent these men to Colombo on a mission that is mere window-dressing and likely to show little by way of results.        
	Menon, a former high commissioner to Colombo, is understood have been sensitive to this reality and argued during two internal discussions in New Delhi this week that India should focus on aid to Sri Lankan Tamils and getting them a decent deal from the Sinhalese after the inevitable decimation of the Tamil Tigers by the victorious Sri Lankan army.        
	Timing is of essence in what India should now be doing in Washington, instead. The struggle within the Obama administration between Holbrookes line of appeasing Pakistan and a more forceful line advocated by career diplomats appears to be nearing a resolution with Clinton throwing her weight against Holbrookes policy of personalising the US policy on South Asia.        
	But alas, India is entirely off the radar in Washington at this time. The Indian embassy here is not only headless, but doubly headless at a time when it should be marshalling all its resources and perhaps getting reinforcements from India.        
	The ambassador designate, Meera Shankar, was to have arrived here on April 20, but she put off her travel and is still in New Delhi.        
	What is worse, South Block asked the charge d affaires, Arun Singh, to be in India now, instead of here and helping to choreograph some of the US moves on a region vital to India.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Pre-poll rush to lighten education loan
                                                                                                           Pre-poll rush to lighten education loan

	New Delhi, Jan. 15: A unique government promise to pay the interest on professional education loans taken by 20 lakh poor students may be delivered ahead of the Lok Sabha elections after being forgotten for five years.        
	A committee of secretaries from several ministries is scrutinising the blueprint for the scheme, which the government hopes to launch just ahead of the expected announcement of elections in March-April, The Telegraph has learnt.         
	The scheme is one of the last major promises in education that were made in the Common Minimum Programme in 2004 but which are yet to see the light of day.        
	The elections have provided the push the scheme always needed. The scheme is finally ready and should be launched soon, a senior government official said.         
	Canara Bank has been selected as the institution that will offer loans under the scheme, the first in India where the government will directly help students pay back education loans, a source said.         
	The human resource development (HRD) ministry scheme can be used by all students doing professional courses whose annual family income is less than Rs 4.5 lakh, the source said.         
	The streams include engineering, medicine, law, chartered accountancy, management and architecture, among others. Ministry estimates suggest that the number of such students is around 20 lakh.         
	The scheme is based on the premise that most students in professional streams seek jobs immediately after completing their courses, officials said.         
	Under the scheme, a student will have to take the loan from the chosen bank, and pay the entire loan amount.         
	The government will pay the interest accumulated over the period of the professional course to the bank the moment the student finds a job after his studies. The student will have to pay the remainder of the interest.         
	If a student chooses to pursue further studies after the course for which he received the loan, the government will hold back the payment of interest till he finds a job.         
	And if the student takes a fresh loan, he will need to apply afresh for the subsidy scheme.         
	The HRD ministry plans to ask for Rs 100 crore in the first year of implementation of the scheme, based on an assessment of the required funds if the rate of interest is 12 per cent.         
	The official said the government expected the Election Commission to announce the Lok Sabha poll dates in March-April, and hinted the loan subsidy scheme might be timed accordingly.        
	The commission can accuse the government of offering poll sops if it makes any populist announcement once the model code of conduct comes into effect.        
	The code is enforced as soon as polls are notified. The elections are likely to start in early May and extend till June.

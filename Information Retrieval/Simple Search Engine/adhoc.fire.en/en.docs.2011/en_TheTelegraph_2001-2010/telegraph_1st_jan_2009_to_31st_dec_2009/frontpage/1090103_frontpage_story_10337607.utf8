  - Chandigarh plans leash on number of pets          GAJINDER SINGH                                                    
	Chandigarh, Jan. 2: Hum do, hamare do.        
	The Chandigarh Municipal Corporation plans to allow only two pet dogs per family, saying it is fed up with the growing number of canine bites and quarrels between neighbours over unruly pets.        
	Any family that has more than two dogs must shell out a tax of Rs 1,000 a year. Nobody will be allowed to keep more than three.        
	The civic body also proposes to book dog owners if their pets defecate in public places or damage anyones property, or enter any public area or place of sight- seeing. No dog zones are being identified across the city.        
	The idea is to ensure that dog owners know how to make their pets behave. The city is full of ferocious dogs that can kill humans, a corporation official said.        
	So, Spitz to Alsatian, dogs can be taken out only on a leash, and those walking them must carry a stick. Owners must also register their Fidos and Toms with the corporation by paying a one-time fee of Rs 500. A licensed dog will be issued a metal badge that it must wear on its collar.        
	A survey by the administration in 2003 had put the citys canine population at 13,950, including 5,408 stray dogs. Bites by pet dogs are increasing by the day. Over 4,000 cases of dog bites are reported every year, the civic official added.        
	Hardeep Grewal, who has four dogs including three Labradors, is livid. Setting a limit to the number of pet dogs is not the right way; the corporation must think about the stray dogs first. A good owner will never let his dogs move around unattended, he said.        
	Since it is the rich who own multiple dogs, they will have no problem with the Rs 1,000 tax for the third dog. But they will be forced to send their fourth and fifth away to relatives, or their farms in Haryana or Punjab.        
	But what happens when pet dogs have puppies, dog lover Rajpal Singh wondered. Will the corporation come and take them away?        
	The civic body, for which maintaining kennels will be a headache, seems not to have worked that problem out yet. An official merely said it was usual in Chandigarh to give puppies away to relatives or friends.        
	But what if the friends already have dogs of their own?        
	Well, they can send their dogs away to their farms, the official said. Anyway, puppies will be allowed to stay with the owners for a certain period that will be worked out. The idea is to end the nuisance created once the dogs are on the streets unattended.        
	The corporation is also thinking of making sterilisation of pet dogs compulsory, he added.

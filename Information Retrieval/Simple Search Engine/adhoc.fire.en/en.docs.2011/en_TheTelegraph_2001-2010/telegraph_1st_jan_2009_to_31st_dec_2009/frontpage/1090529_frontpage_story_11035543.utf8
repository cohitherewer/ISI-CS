          K.P. NAYAR                             Tim Roemer                                  
	Washington, May 28: Tim   Roemer brings to Roosevelt   House, the residence of the US   ambassador in New Delhi, a   chilling story of his providen  tial escape from a devastating   terrorist attack in Islamabad   last year, in which scores of   people were killed and hundreds injured.  
	 US president Barack   Obama yesterday nominated   Roemer, a former Democratic   Congressman from Indiana to   be his new envoy to India, end  ing a long phase of heavy lob  bying by several prominent   South Asia experts here for   the diplomatic post in New   Delhi which has become an   important job in recent years.  
	 Roemer has recounted the   story of his narrow escape   from the huge terrorist attack   in Islamabad on September 20,   2008.  
	 ldquo;I was preparing to board a   flight from Kuwait to Pakistan   when I received an urgent e-  mail. Our destination, the   Marriott in Islamabad, had   been demolished by a truck   bomb, rdquo; Roemer wrote in The   Philadelphia Inquirer when   he came home from that trip.  
	 There was speculation   after the bombing that a US   Congressional delegation, of  which Roemer was member,   was the target of the terrorists  and that al Qaeda mixed up the 
  dates of the delegation's visit   or that disinformation was   spread in Pakistan about the 
  group rsquo;s itinerary.  
	 But the providential escape from a terrorist attack   may also have firmed up the   ambassador's views on South   Asia in a direction negative   enough for the next foreign   secretary to have to work on   Roemer once he lands in New   Delhi.  
	 ldquo;We also must address the   tension between Pakistan and   India over Kashmir, rdquo; Roemer   wrote in The Philadelphia In  quirer. ldquo;For generations, this   issue has fuelled extremism   and served as a central source   of friction between two nu  clear states. Resolving this dis  pute would allow them to focus   more on sustainable develop  ment and less on armed conflict. rdquo;  
	 He added ominously, leav  ing much to be read between   the lines: ldquo;We need to harness   the energy of the international community to resolve secu  rity issues in the (South Asia) 
  region. rdquo;  
	 During and in the run up to   hearings on Roemer rsquo;s confirmation on Capitol Hill, Indian 
  lobbyists will prevail upon a   slew of Senators to din into   the incoming ambassador   New Delhi rsquo;s view that Kashmir is not the root cause of   tension between India and 
  Pakistan.  
	 But once he arrives in   Chanakyapuri, South Block   will have its job cut out on ensuring that Roemer follows the   Indian script on Kashmir like   several of his recent predeces  sors.  
	 Under Roemer, the US embassy will reclaim its role on   policy. The previous envoy in 
  New Delhi was short on policy   and believed that economics   was more important than politics in diplomacy.  
	 David Mulford often put   his foot in his mouth. As a result, decisions on India were   almost exclusively made in   Washington, reducing the US   embassy in India to a mere   courier outpost.				   
	Roemer, on the other hand,   has dedicated long years of his   public life to strengthening US   national security. As a mem  ber of the Congressional Per  manent Select Committee on   Intelligence, he was the prime   mover for a joint Congressional inquiry into the nature of   the attacks on the US on September 11, 2001.   
	 He later served on an inquiry panel which came be known as ldquo;the 9/11 Commission. rdquo; He continues to be on the Commission for the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism, created by the US Congress two years ago.  
	 If Indian schools are looking for a patron for improving their performance in basketball, the incoming US ambassador is their man: Roemer loves coaching children's basketball teams.  Collectors or sellers of old, used first edition books will have a friend in Roosevelt House. Picking up such books is a passion for Roemer.  The new external affairs minister, S.M. Krishna, need not worry that India rsquo;s views will not get right to the White House Oval Office.  
	 As one of the first Democrats to endorse Obama in his presidential primaries, Roemer vigorously campaigned for Obama in as many as 11 states. He was at one stage mentioned as a choice for the cabinet, but the president eventually decided that Roemer would be more useful in New Delhi.

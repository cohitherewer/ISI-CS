          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranchi, May 27: Subodh Kant Sahay, the lone Congress MP from Jharkhand who is being sworn in tomorrow as a cabinet minister, believes that he has been promoted because of his political experience and close ties with people in the state capital.        
	I have had the experience of working with two prime ministers as minister of state for home. Besides, I created enough space for the food processing ministry in my last tenure, said the former minister of state (independent charge) and three-time MP who was first elected to the Lok Sabha from Ranchi in 1989.        
	Sahay, who was also MLA for three terms, said he had no idea of the portfolio he was getting, but he seems to have been tipped for either coal/steel or industry.        
	 The cabinet berth is more of a challenge for me, he told The Telegraph. This means, two former chief ministers of Jharkhand, JMM MP Shibu Soren and Independent MP Madhu Koda, had been bypassed by the Congress.        
	More than Soren, Koda had lobbied hard through an influential Congress leader for a ministerial berth. He even claimed to have won over an Independent, Uma Prasad Yadav, from Bihar to support the UPA.        
	 According to sources, the JMM was qualified to be in the Union ministry as it was a pre-poll partner of the Congress, but the prime Minister wasnt keen on Soren. As an Independent supporting the UPA, Koda, however, did not stand a chance.        
	Had the Congress included him, it would have had to include four or five more ministers, including RJD MPs in the cabinet, said a senior Congress leader.

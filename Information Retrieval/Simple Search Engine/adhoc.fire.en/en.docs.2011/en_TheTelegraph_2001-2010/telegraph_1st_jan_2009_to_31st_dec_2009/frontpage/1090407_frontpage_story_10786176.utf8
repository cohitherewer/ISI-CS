The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Election blues? Look up to Jakarta for the cure
                                                                                                           Election blues? Look up to Jakarta for the cure
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             A supporter of the Indonesian Democratic Party with painted face and buffalo hat symbolising the party during a rally in Jakarta. (Reuters)                                  
	New Delhi, April 6: Indian candidates driven to the edge worrying about the day of reckoning, May 16, may take hope from Indonesia.        
	The Southeast Asian country, which votes on April 9, has found a way of giving succour to candidates devastated by defeat  it is setting up psychiatric treatment centres for them.        
	With 1.6 million candidates vying for some 18,000 seats in national, provincial and district legislatures, Jakarta is not taking any chances. It has ordered the nations 32 mental hospitals to put their doctors on alert for a surge in patients after the poll results are declared, reports the Jakarta Post.        
	The Surakarta mental hospital has formed a special team of five psychiatrists, six psychologists, three social workers, two religious therapists and 10 nurses.         
	The newspaper quotes hospital director Muhammad Sigit: It (becoming mentally disturbed) is natural. They have spent a lot of money, energy and effort. Im sure no one is ready to lose.        
	Once they lose, they find themselves neck-deep in debt and get depressed.        
	Candidates have been spending billions of rupiah each to buy their poll ticket, the Post says in a revelation that would hardly surprise Indian politicians.        
	Many have auctioned off their hard-earned assets and even borrowed money from lenders to fund everything from banners and political lobbying to lunch boxes and T-shirts for potential voters.        
	The newspaper describes how a candidate defeated in a recent election now spends his days staring at the ceiling in a mental hospital.        
	Indias politicians are not known to lose all their money  or their mind  over an election defeat, but the Indonesian polls, spread across 14,000 islands in a logistical nightmare, is a different kind of beast. The hundreds of thousands of ambitious citizens who jump into the fray face huge odds.        
	Showing just how slim an aspirants chance is, consider that this year 11,215 people are vying for 560 seats at the House; 1,109 for 132 seats in the Regional Representative Council.         
	At the regional level, 112,000 people are competing for 1,998 provincial legislative council seats and an estimated 1.5 million others are battling for 15,750 seats on regent/municipal legislative councils, the Post says.        
	A recent survey by an Indonesian hospital found that defeated candidates were susceptible to mental disorders with symptoms such as weariness, insomnia, frustration, the feeling of uselessness and the urge to commit suicide.        
	The Post links this mad scenario to the widespread corruption in the countrys politics, explaining that victorious candidates are forced to try and recoup the money lost in electioneering.        
	It has one worry, though: The facilities (at the mental hospitals) would be totally overrun if just 1 per cent of the failed candidates were institutionalised. With a total 8,500 rooms, the 32 hospitals would be far from enough.

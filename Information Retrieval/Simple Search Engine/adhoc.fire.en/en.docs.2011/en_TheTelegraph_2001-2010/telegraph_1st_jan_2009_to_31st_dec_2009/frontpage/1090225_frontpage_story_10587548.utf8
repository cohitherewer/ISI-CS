          G.S. MUDUR                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 24: Scientists in public-funded research centres and academic institutions across India may be able to hold equity stakes in knowledge-driven companies in a major policy shift approved by the cabinet on Monday.        
	The cabinet cleared a set of proposals to unshackle researchers from government conduct rules that have prevented their participation in technology companies while retaining their jobs in their own institutions.        
	The proposals, from the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR), are aimed at encouraging the transfer of innovation from Indias research and academic sectors into industries and  eventually  into the marketplace.        
	Indias universities and research centres have had a poor track record of transfer of technology. In many instances, technologies have not hit the market even after transfer from laboratories to industries. While industries have complained that technologies are half-baked and unfit for commercialisation, researchers have accused industries of not investing enough to push laboratory innovations towards the market.        
	Were hoping the new policy will encourage scientists with confidence in their own innovations to test out their entrepreneurial skills, a DSIR official said. This is among our biggest initiatives to promote the commercialisation of innovation.        
	The proposals will also allow scientists in public-funded institutions to spend short periods  up to two years  in industries. Sometimes a seamless mobility across institutions facilitates transfer of innovation, an official said.        
	The proposals are expected to apply to scientists in all universities, engineering and technology colleges, and government-funded research laboratories except centres under the three strategic departments  space, atomic energy and defence research. But various councils governing each set of institutions would need to pencil specific rules and regulations for their own staff before they come into practice.        
	But Indian scientists who have turned successful entrepreneurs caution that the challenge of managing research and academic duties while pursuing innovation is tougher than it appears from the outside.        
	The (scientific or academic) institutions should provide enough flexibility to allow scientists to work in industry and in the parent institutions, said Ramesh Hariharan, chief technology officer with Strand Genomics, a company founded by four scientists at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, about eight years ago. Sometimes its difficult to carry out duties on both sides, Hariharan said.        
	The IISc had pioneered the researcher-innovation movement in India by allowing Hariharan and three other faculty members to set up their own company involved in bioinformatics and genomics.

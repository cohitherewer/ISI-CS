The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Count puts poverty at 50%, riles govt 
                                                                                                           Count puts poverty at 50%, riles govt 
          CITHARA PAUL                                          
	New Delhi, Sept. 20: At least half the countrys rural population lives in poverty, a government-appointed expert panel has said, nearly doubling the Planning Commissions estimate that 28 per cent of Indian villagers are poor.        
	The Centre, however, appears likely to go by the plan panels figures rather than the N.C. Saxena committees higher count which, if adopted, will enormously hike expenditure on anti-poverty schemes by adding crores to the list of beneficiaries.        
	The irony is that the government itself had appointed the Saxena committee to work out new criteria to decide which households lived below the poverty line.        
	Asked about the possibility of implementing the Saxena report, handed in last month, rural development minister C.P. Joshi said: The Saxena committee was not asked to count the poor but to develop a methodology to identify the poor.        
	He added that the report was not binding on the government.        
	However, junking the panels figures would amount to rejecting the suggested criteria too. For, the panels figures are based on the new criteria it has suggested in its report, as well as data from state governments and the food ministry.        
	The committee has suggested five exclusion criteria for the 2009 below-poverty-line (BPL) survey: average per head spending over Rs 1,000 a month in urban areas and Rs 700 in rural areas; or ownership of a pucca house, or two-wheeler, or mechanised farm implement like a tractor, or landholding above the district average.        
	The Planning Commission, however, went by a different cutoff for average per head spending  Rs 356 a month in rural areas and Rs 539 a month in urban areas. One other criterion it used was daily calorie intake: 2,400 kilocalories in villages and 2,100 for urban areas.        
	Its figure of 28 per cent poor is the same as that obtained by using the old BPL criteria, fixed during the previous survey in 2002, which the Saxena panel was tasked to revise.        
	The Planning Commission has written to Saxena saying: Fixing the BPL percentage at 50 per cent will have tremendous financial implications and once granted it cannot be reduced.        
	The Saxena committee has cited food ministry data, which mention 10.5 crore BPL cards in the country. This would already account for roughly 53 crore poor  nearly half the population  it says.        
	Saxena has found fault with the National Sample Survey Organisations data, on which the plan panels calculations were based. The committee factored in inflation too, but has not given the details of how this was done.        
	One other reason for its higher count is that it compulsorily includes in the BPL list all Primitive Tribal Groups and households headed by single women or minors, those with a disabled person as the breadwinner, destitute households, and families of bonded labourers.        
	Saxena, a former rural development secretary, and the plan panel differ also on the state-wise poverty count. Whereas Saxena finds two states with more than 80 per cent of their people eligible for BPL status (see chart), the plan panel finds none with above 50 per cent poor.        
	The Saxena committee says that though the official poverty count fell from 56 per cent in 1973-74 to 28 per cent in 2004 going by the governments old BPL criteria, there has been no real decline in the number of the poor.        
	Analysing the existing and old BPL lists, it says a large number of poor families have been left out of poverty alleviation programmes and these must be the voiceless people living in remote hamlets.

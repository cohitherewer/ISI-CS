          OUR BUREAU                                          A closed ATM kiosk of a private bank in Tollygunge on Thursday. (Amit Datta)      
	Calcutta, Aug. 6: A seamless cash-dispensing facility froze in fear in Calcutta today as a strike crippled ATMs of even non-unionised banks.        
	The bank strike, which will be in place for 24 hours more till Friday night, left countless people scrambling for currency in the city as ATMs of new-age banks also downed shutters after pickets outside their cash-dispenser sites.        
	This is the first bank strike since the RBI allowed people from April 1 to withdraw cash without charge from even ATMs of banks in which they did not hold accounts.         
	The seamless facility would have allowed people to access cash from ATMs of new private banks while the older ones were on strike.        
	The two-day shutdown has been called by employees of public and old private banks to press demands for wage revision and pension changes.        
	Employees of newer banks like HDFC and ICICI, which do not have unions, are not taking part in the strike. But the sight of protesters outside the offsite ATMs prompted many banks to close the centres in Calcutta.        
	Not surprisingly, strike-capital Calcutta was the worst affected  new banks functioned more or less as usual in Delhi and Mumbai.        
	Since early morning, there were pickets by agitating unions outside our branches and controlling office here and we could not get to work, said Kakoli Majumdar, operations head for eastern region, Axis Bank.        
	We had to close down our ATMs because we could not take risks when we heard that our ATMs would be destroyed if opened during the 48 hours of the strike, she added. People at our head office in Mumbai could not believe this as they functioned near-normal today.        
	Public sector banks and their onsite as well as offsite ATMs were either closed or were running out of cash by 10am.        
	We are not part of this strike. But for security reasons, we had to close down some branches and ATMs, said Sangram Das of ICICI Bank.         
	I have been trying for two hours to withdraw money for the discharge of my mother from MR Bangur Hospital, Partha Acharya, an insurance agent, said in front of a closed SBI ATM at Park Street, several kilometres away from the hospital. He eventually found an open ATM on Camac Street.        
	Told about Acharya, Ashok Mukherjee, a member of the SBI Staff Association, said: In cases of extreme emergencies, we believe the hospital administration will understand. Things will be okay on Saturday.        
	We know, people will face hardships because of this and we are sorry for that, he added.

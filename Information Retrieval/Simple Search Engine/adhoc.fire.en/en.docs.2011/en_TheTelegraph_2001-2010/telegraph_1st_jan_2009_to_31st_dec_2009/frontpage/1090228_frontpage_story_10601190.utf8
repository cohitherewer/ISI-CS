                                                                                                           Strike ends, twin train relief for commuters
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                            The torched bus                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 27: The Orissa Bus Owners Association called off their two-day strike after the transport minister promised to hear out their demands at a March 1 meeting.        
	The state witnessed a chaotic day before the strike was called off, as passengers remained stranded while approximately 1,000 buses went off the roads.        
	The situation turned so bad that the government requested East Coast Railway to run two special trains between Cuttack and Puri to ferry commuters. The trains ran twice in the day  one left Cuttack at 9.30am and arrived at Puri at 12.30pm. The down train left Puri at 1.30pm and reached Cuttack at 5.00pm. The trains halted at all stations between Cuttack and Puri. The railway also provided a special train between Cuttack and Puri.        
	Thousands of passengers, including students, were stranded at the states various bus stops, while autorickshaws and taxis had a field day making a quick buck at the expense of the harried people. At some places, bus fares were hiked twice the original amount. Pilgrims to Puri were affected the most. The soaring mercury added to the woes of passengers, who waited for hours for a bus. The government pressed 50 Orissa State Road Transportation Corporation buses into service today. No organised body goes in for a strike in such short notice. We were contemplating legal action against private bus operators for resorting to the indefinite strike and causing inconvenience to the people, said transport secretary Pradip Jena.        
	The Orissa Bus Owners Association had called the strike after a passenger bus was torched by a mob on Monday after it allegedly ran over a dhaba worker. The strike was called to demand the removal of shops and roadside dhabas on the Bhubaneswar-Puri and Bhubaneswar-Cuttack routes and for compensation to be paid to the bus owner. The association is also demanding that the state formulate a law under which a fine can be collected from the people indulging in vandalism.

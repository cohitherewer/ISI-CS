	Ranchi, Nov. 12: Sitting RJD MLA and Manika candidate Ram Chander Singh and six others were reportedly kidnapped by Sanjay Yadav, a leader of Jharkhand Chhattisgarh Seemant Committee, today.         
	The committee is a splinter group of the CPI(Maoist). The seven were abducted on their way back from an election meeting at Taradih village in Latehar district. The incident occurred around 7.30pm.

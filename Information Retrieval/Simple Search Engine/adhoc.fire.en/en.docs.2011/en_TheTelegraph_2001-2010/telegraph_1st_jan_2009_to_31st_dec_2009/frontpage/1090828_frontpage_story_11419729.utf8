                                                                                                           Cabinet nod for rural gender equality
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 27: The government today approved a proposal to reserve half the number of seats in panchayats for women, addressing one of the goals the President set in a speech to a joint Parliament session earlier this year.        
	Under Article 243(d) of the Constitution, one-third of the seats in panchayat bodies are now reserved for women and Pratibha Patil, in her June 4 address, had said an amendment would be brought in to increase the quota to 50 per cent.        
	The goal also covered urban local bodies as Patil repeatedly emphasised the need to focus on women.        
	Sources said the panchayati raj ministry was likely to move a bill in the next Parliament session to give effect to the increased quota that would be applicable to seats filled by direct elections and offices of chairpersons, including those reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.        
	This is a path-breaking decision, information and broadcasting minister Ambika Soni told reporters after a cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.        
	Enhancing reservation for women in panchayats will facilitate more women to enter public sphere. This would lead to further empowerment of women and make panchayats more inclusive institutions, improve governance and public service delivery, she said, adding that there were no financial implications in operationalising the proposal.        
	The amendment would cover all states and Union territories except Nagaland, Meghalaya, Mizoram, tribal areas of Assam, Tripura and hill areas of Manipur.        
	This is a good move, provided male relatives of these women representatives dont indulge in backseat driving, said Neeraja Chandroke of the organisation Stree Sakthi.        
	Bengal panchayat minister Anisur Rahman welcomed the cabinet decision, but said he would urge the Centre to scrap reservation for women and SC/STs in posts of chiefs of rural bodies as it was creating problems.        
	Say, for example, in a gram panchayat, the chiefs post is reserved for women and no woman candidate wins. Then the post goes to the rival party. This system is undemocratic, he said.        
	In her speech, Patil had said women suffer multiple deprivations of class, caste and gender, and enhancing reservation in panchayats and urban local bodies would lead to more women entering the public sphere.        
	Some states like Bihar, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh have already taken the lead and enforced 50 per cent reservation for women in panchayati raj institutions. Information and broadcasting minister Soni said the proposal for 50 per cent quota for women in urban local bodies was likely to be taken up separately.

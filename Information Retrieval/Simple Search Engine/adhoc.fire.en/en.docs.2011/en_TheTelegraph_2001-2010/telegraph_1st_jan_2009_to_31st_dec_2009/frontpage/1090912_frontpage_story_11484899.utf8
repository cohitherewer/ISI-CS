	Siliguri/Calcutta, Sept. 11: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today deferred his return to Calcutta from Mongpong near Siliguri as he was unwell.        
	State urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said the chief minister was having breathing problems.         
	Sources in the chief ministers secretariat said he was suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a chest ailment common to smokers which was causing the breathlessness.        
	Bhattacharjee was earlier scheduled to return to the city yesterday so that he could attend the CPMs state secretariat meeting this morning.         
	Doctors have advised him rest. They have also told him that it would be better not to smoke. But he is yet to give up the habit, an official said.        
	Asked whether a medical team from Calcutta was needed at Mongpong, he replied: The chief minister has gone to north Bengal to take rest as he is not well. If theres any need to provide better medical treatment, he would be brought back to Calcutta. Why would doctors from Calcutta be sent there?        
	A three-member team of the Darjeeling district health administration, comprising a doctor and two paramedics, is camping in Mongpong. Subir Bhowmik, the chief medical officer of health of Darjeeling, said the team had not been called for any medical assistance.        
	Asok Bhattacharya said: As of now, the plans are that the chief minister will return to Calcutta tomorrow.        
	The CPM leadership said Bhattacharjee was indisposed both mentally and physically.         
	Despite his ill health, he spoke at a rally in Siliguri and his small vacation at Mongpong was planned accordingly. This is why boudi (Mira Bhattacharjee) went along with him, said a state secretariat member.         
	Since there were no pressing engagements in the city or anything of immediate importance on the agenda of the state secretariat meeting, the chief minister decided to stay on at Mongpong.         
	He had been advised by doctors a few days rest in the hills, the secretariat member said.        
	Dr Pawan Agarwal, a city-based respiratory medicine specialist, said: The predominant cause of COPD is smoking.Agarwal said reasonably good treatment is available to provide relief to the patient. The first step to controlling COPD is to stop smoking and then one should start exercising.        
	Doctors suggest a brisk walk and breathing exercises.         
	Bhattacharjee is spending his time at Mongpong mostly indoors, taking rest and reading.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Shillong, Aug. 31: The Khasi Students Union will serve a 15-day ultimatum on the Meghalaya government to change its earlier decision of allowing the Uranium Corporation of India Limited to carry out pre-development activities at the uranium mining sites in West Khasi Hills.         
	The ultimatum will come into effect from tomorrow.        
	The decision was taken at the central executive committee meeting this evening at the office of the students union.         
	On August 24, the cabinet approved pre-development activities at the uranium mining sites by the UCIL at Rs 209 crore out of the total project cost of Rs 1,000 crore.        
	The cabinet also decided to lease out 422 acres of land in West Khasi Hills for 30 years to the UCIL to carry out uranium mining and the royalty to be paid to the state government by the UCIL will be Rs 20 crore a year. The UCIL proposed two phases of the project.         
	Of the total project cost of Rs 1,000 crore, in the first phase it will spend Rs 209 crore for development activities like construction of roads, health centres and educational institutions before starting uranium mining.         
	In the second phase, the remaining money will be spent once the project starts with the official no-objection certificate from the state government. After todays meeting, KSU president Samuel Jyrwa said if the cabinet did not scrap the August 24 decision by September 15, they would be forced to hit the streets.         
	According to Jyrwa, uranium mining will cause health hazards. He said the decision of the cabinet to allow the UCIL to begin preparatory works was a clear indication that the government was in favour of uranium mining.         
	The KSU and the Langrin Youth Welfare Association, another anti-mining group from the mining sites, have also flayed regional parties like the UDP and KHNAM which are part of the Congress-led Meghalaya United Alliance government for keeping mum on the issue when the cabinet took the decision.         
	The KSU and the association allege that the UDP and the KHNAM in their manifestos circulated before the 2008 Assembly elections had opposed uranium mining in West Khasi Hills. We are surprised over their sudden change of stand, Jyrwa said.        
	On Friday, the associations president B.S. Lyngdoh and its secretary Andreas S. Lyngdoh alleged the cabinets decision to allow the groundwork was nothing but a green-signal to the UCIL to start mining.

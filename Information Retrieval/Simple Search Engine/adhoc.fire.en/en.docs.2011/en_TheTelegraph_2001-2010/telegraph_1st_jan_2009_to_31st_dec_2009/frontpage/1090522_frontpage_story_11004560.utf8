          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              Sen and Bhattacharjee at Writers. (Sanat Kumar Sinha)				                                 
	Calcutta, May 21: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today kicked off efforts to distance himself from the land controversy by stripping his point man on industrialisation, Nirupam Sen, of a board meant to identify land for industry.        
	The chief minister took the land-use board away from industries minister Sen and gave it back to land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah, one of the most vocal critics of Bhattacharjees land acquisition policy within the CPM.        
	The state cabinet, which took the decision, also dropped a land acquisition plan for a 120-acre, joint-venture, commercial-cum-sports complex near Kharagpur town.        
	The two decisions could signal a halt to Bhattacharjees industrialisation policy at a time many CPM leaders are blaming the land controversy for the election rout in Bengal.        
	The transferred boards basic function is to draw up land-use patterns in Bengal, identify mono-crop, multi-crop and barren plots, and assess the total area in the state that is under forest cover.        
	An administrative body with some outside experts on it, the board had been shifted from Mollahs ministry to the control, planning and development department under Sen three years ago. It was to guide the governments decisions on land use for industry, agriculture and other purposes, but lay virtually defunct and ignored as land was identified across the state for industry.        
	Todays move comes two days after the CPM state secretariat decided Bhattacharjee would no longer play a visible role in land acquisition, which the government may carry out with extreme caution, if necessary.        
	The chief minister would, instead, be projected as being more active in rural development, job generation, and minority welfare schemes to try and give him an image makeover before the crucial 2011 Assembly polls.        
	This would have to be adhered to strictly since most of us found the land issue a major spoiler, a secretariat member said.        
	Many in the CPM and the Left Front feel Bhattacharjees involvement in the Singur and Nandigram controversies, and his aggressive poll campaign on the need for industrialisation, had backfired. The dominant mood is to put land acquisition on the back burner even if this means halting the industrialisation drive.        
	At the cabinet meeting, as the allies prepared to go on the offensive on the land issue, Bhattacharjee said the proposal for the public-private project under the Midnapore-Kharagpur Development Authority had been dropped and no land would be acquired.        
	Mollah and RSP minister Kshiti Goswami, opponents of hasty takeover of farmland, had cited that the proposal did not mention the character of the land to be acquired. Neither is it clear who would be the private sector partner and how many jobs would be generated, Goswami said.        
	Yes, I too have such questions, Bhattacharjee said and dropped the project. I am told the land is a short distance from the town. I should have been told what kind of land is involved.        
	The land-use boards transfer may be seen as a small shift in power equations within the CPM, but Mollah was not keen to take charge of it despite Bhattacharjees assurances about adequate manpower to revive the board.         
	Reconstituting the board is a cumbersome process; it will take a lot of time since we have to involve the Public Service Commission to recruit staff. By then the Assembly polls will be here, Mollah said.

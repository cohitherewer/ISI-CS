	New Delhi, Aug 1 (PTI): CBI today conducted searches at the house of Buta Singhs son here and recovered three unlicensed fire arms and few live cartridges.              
	The searches were conducted a day after CBI arrested Sarobjit Singh alias Sweety for allegedly demanding a bribe of Rs one crore from a Nashik-based contractor for settling a case against him in the National Commission for Scheduled Castes headed by his father.              
	CBI sources said the agency will also interrogate Buta Singh as part of its investigations into the graft case registered in Mumbai.              
	A case under the Arms Act has been registered against Sweety at the Nizamuddin police station.              
	Reacting to the seizure, Buta Singh said his son had the licences for all the weapons recovered from his house during the raid.              
	 quot;The licences are there.Only my son knows where they are. When he comes (out of custody), he will produce them.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Vedic verdict hangs over Rezzak
                                                                                                           Vedic verdict hangs over Rezzak
  - Question mark on land acquisition opponents progress in CPM          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Vedic Village: Looks can be deceptive.                                       
	Calcutta, Aug. 28: Since Singur shook Bengal politics, Abdur Rezzak Mollah has been Alimuddin Streets shooting star, thanks primarily to his opposition to the partys and chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees policy of acquiring farmland for industry.        
	His rise and fall in Bhattacharjees rating since the last Lok Sabha polls even prompted a section of the CPM leadership to think of upgrading him, both in the party and the government as part of a damage-control strategy.        
	The Vedic Village episode seems to have suddenly put a question mark on Mollahs fortunes in the CPM.        
	While Mollah defends his role in the land deal and denies any wrongdoing, the question that surrounds his future also exposes the post-poll dilemma in the CPM, some leaders said.        
	We are not a party that takes whimsical decisions on who will be in which position. We will weigh all options before considering the Vedic Village case and Rezzaks role. It is better not to speculate, a CPM state secretariat member said when asked whether the affair can affect Mollahs rise.         
	Many in the leadership, including some in the politburo, had thought Mollah could be an asset in addressing two of the CPMs major problems in the present situation: the loss of Muslim votes and the alienation from the farmers. They had also considered a larger role for him so that it could help the party to try and win back the support of farmers in general and the minorities in particular.        
	Mollahs stand on the land issue and his influence among the minority population, some CPM leaders felt, made him a good candidate for a deputy chief ministers post.        
	Others, however, pointed out that Mollah was unlikely to be elevated to such a position because he was not a member of either the state secretariat or the central committee of the party. Three others in the state cabinet, Nirupam Sen, Gautam Deb and Surjya Kanta Mishra, are senior to him in the hierarchy  Sen a politburo member and Deb and Mishra both state secretariat and central committee members.        
	With the Vedic Village incident bringing out a different land story out in the open, the question now being asked in CPM circles is whether Mollah could prove more a liability than an asset.        
	Mollah defended his decision to lease out land vested in the government to the resort owners because of legal compulsions. Further, he said the governments joint venture project with the promoters to develop an IT park that made room for direct purchase of land by realtors was taken by the cabinet and not by his department.        
	Mollah denied any relation with Gaffar Mollah, who has emerged as the face of the so-called land mafia in the area. I stay in Canning while Gaffar is from Rajarhat. I dont know who patronised or protected him before 2006. But he is with the Trinamul MLA of Bhangar, Mollah added.        
	There are, however, allegations that Gaffar had links to the minister before he switched allegiance to the Trinamul Congress.         
	A CPM central committee member said: Now that it is known that Rezzak-da had accepted the out-of-court settlement with Vedic Village, his arguments against Bhattacharjees industrialisation drive would ring hollow. Similarly, perceptions about him in the party may change because his crusader image may take a beating. It may also put a question mark on his chances of moving up the party hierarchy.        
	According to party sources, an embarrassment for Mollah in the aftermath of the Vedic Village affair could help the chief minister in two ways.        
	One, it can come as a vindication of his land-for-industry policy. Two, it could help him in his internal party battle on the issue. Particularly so as Rezzak had even sent a letter to Anil Biswas (the late CPM state secretary) complaining that he was not in favour of indiscriminate takeover of agricultural land, the sources added.        
	Asked whether he had consulted Bhattacharjee before settling the matter with Vedic Village, Mollah said: The resort promoters approached me. I took the decision on the basis of the court order. So, there was no need to talk to the chief minister or my party.

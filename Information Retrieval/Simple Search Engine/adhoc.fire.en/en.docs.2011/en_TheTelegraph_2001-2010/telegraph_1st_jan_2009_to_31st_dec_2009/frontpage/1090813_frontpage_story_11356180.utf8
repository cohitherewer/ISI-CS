  - Income tax relief expected but home and retirement benefits to take hit         OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                     
	New Delhi, Aug. 12: The government today kick-started radical tax reforms by unveiling a draft tax code under which an individual will effectively not have to pay any tax on an income of up to Rs 4.6 lakh a year against Rs 2.7 lakh at present.        
	The ceilings on tax-free income will be raised to Rs 4.9 lakh in the case of women and Rs 5.4 lakh in the case of senior citizens.        
	The code proposes zero tax on an income of up to Rs 1.6 lakh but also provides for a tax deduction of up to Rs 3 lakh on bank fixed deposits and specified investments in small savings schemes, insurance and other savings instruments.        
	Over and above the Rs 3 lakh ceiling, taxpayers can claim deductions for money spent on childrens education, health insurance premia up to Rs 20,000 annually in the case of senior citizens (Rs 15,000 for the rest), medical treatment of up to Rs 60,000 annually for senior citizens (Rs 40,000 for the rest), and expenses up to Rs 1 lakh for disabled dependants.        
	But theres bad news as well: there will be no tax break for buying an apartment (which qualifies at present for a tax benefit of Rs 1.5 lakh a year on interest payments). Moreover, withdrawals from retirement funds will no longer be exempt from tax.        
	Salaried individuals may also feel the pinch since all perks will now be included in the definition of taxable salaries.        
	Companies will have to pay tax at the rate of 25 per cent instead of an effective rate of almost 35 per cent at present. However, companies that pay minimum alternate tax (MAT)  a tax levied since 1997 on zero-tax companies  could face a big blow since the levy will now be charged on 2 per cent of their gross assets. Earlier, it was charged on 15 per cent of book profits.        
	2 years to kick in         
	The changes have been proposed in a tax code that seeks to replace the 48-year-old Income-Tax Act. The code has been put in the public domain for discussion. It will come into effect in about two years after it is passed by Parliament with changes.        
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, who released the tax code along with his predecessor P. Chidambaram, said the bill could be tabled in Parliament in the winter session.        
	Its a simpler tax code and we expect it will usher in better compliance, better tax realisation and lead to far less litigation, Mukherjee added.        
	Chidambaram said the tax code had been written from scratch and could be enacted by 2011, synchronising with the golden jubilee of the Income-Tax Act. The former finance minister had started work on the tax code three years ago.        
	Wealth tax        
	The ambit of wealth tax is being widened  and this could prove to be a huge blow to the super-rich. Wealth tax will be levied on a net wealth above Rs 50 crore instead of Rs 30 lakh at present but it will cover assets like shares.         
	However, the wealth tax rate is being slashed from 1 per cent at present to 0.25 per cent. This has been done to ensure better compliance, officials said. Right now, it is a tax that everybody tries to avoid.        
	Industry has been lobbying the government to scrap it since the government expects to raise only Rs 425 crore through wealth tax this year.        
	The direct tax code will obviate the need to introduce a voluminous Finance Bill every year along with the budget  a tiresome rite that former finance minister Jaswant Singh railed against recently during the budget debate. However, tax amendments will still require sanction from Parliament.        
	Political parties will be happy to learn that the new tax code allows tax deductions on campaign contributions by both individuals and companies, provided the donation amounts to 5 per cent of a persons income or the profits of a company.

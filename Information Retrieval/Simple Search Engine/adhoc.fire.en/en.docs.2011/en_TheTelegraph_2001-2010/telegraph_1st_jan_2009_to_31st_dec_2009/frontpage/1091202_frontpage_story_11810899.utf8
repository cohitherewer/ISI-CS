	Ranchi, Dec. 1: A week into the month-long Assembly election process, the Congress and the BJP have suddenly discovered the virtues of a positive campaign.        
	A day after former chief minister Madhu Koda was arrested and jailed, and on the eve of the second phase of elections to 14 constituencies, both parties displayed a startling eagerness to drop the corruption issue and talk of development and stability.        
	If the BJP made it clear that henceforth it wouldnt over stress corruption, the Congress insisted that Koda was a closed chapter, both assertions indicative of the extent to which the former chief ministers alleged tainted tenure had monopolised the poll campaign.        
	We are not fighting elections on negative issues only, BJP national president Rajnath Singh told The Telegraph over phone from New Delhi. We will raise the corruption issue but it will not be the only plank. Elections should not be fought on negative issues only.        
	The Congress maintained there was no political motive behind Kodas arrest. Since he had defied three summons, the Vigilance Bureau had no option but to arrest him in order to take the investigation further, said Union minister for food processing and Ranchi MP Subodh Kant Sahay.        
	He wouldnt admit, however, that Kodas arrest was perhaps a good move that came too late. Koda isnt an issue and his arrest will not create any political impact. In fact, I believe he wasnt advised properly. Apne he lahoo lagakar shahid banana chah rahey they (He was trying to become a martyr by committing suicide).        
	If the Congress stand was predictable, the BJPs apparent climbdown on corruption was surprising, especially since it had managed to corner the Congress on its support to the Koda government.         
	According to party sources, the BJP believed the corruption issue hadnt caught on with voters, particularly those in the remote constituencies of, say, Jagannathpur and Kolebira that were far removed from the media glare on the previous governments alleged wrongdoings.         
	So, its better not to create a hype over corruption. Instead, we will raise positive issues, pointed out a senior BJP leader.         
	In fact, all the so called tainted former ministers have doled out something or the other to their constituents. It doesnt really matter to their electorate where or how they made the money, he claimed.        
	A Congress leader, however, said the party was in a win-win situation. If Koda wins a few seats, he would have no option but to support the Congress without any bargaining. If he fails, it is advantage for the Congress in Singhbhum, he claimed.        
	Rajnath indicated that the BJP would now focus on development and stability. We are now going to the electorate with our promise to provide rice at Re 1, electricity, employment, pucca houses etc, Rajnath Singh said.        
	Political stability is our biggest plank. Only the BJP can provide the much-needed stability in the state. Past records show that the BJP emerged to be the biggest player in the 2005 Assembly elections and also in the May Lok Sabha elections, he added.        
	The Congress, too, spoke of stability. We are fighting the elections on the plank of political stability. And we mean it, Sahay asserted.         
	About corruption and Koda, he even tried to the turn the tables on rivals BJP by alleging that former chief minister Arjun Munda was the real guru of Koda as he had allotted several mines during his tenure.        
	He denied suggestions that Kodas arrest would spark a sympathy wave for him. Koda did not win in the parliamentary elections because he was a big leader. Rather, he bought votes using his ill gotten wealth, Sahay alleged.        
	If you are not in power, nobody listens to you. Gale me dala hua mala bhi nikal leta hai (People will rip off the garland around your neck if you are out of power), he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Tender hiccup for fire bypass
                                                                                                           Tender hiccup for fire bypass
  - Lowest bidder quotes 14.5% of cost        AMIT GUPTA                                     
	Ranchi, Oct. 4: The proposed diversion of NH-33 to bypass the underground fire zone in Kujju has hit fresh hurdle.        
	In response to tenders invited by the road construction department for the 1,255m diversion, the lowest bid quoted is 14.5 per cent above the estimated cost of Rs 7.5 crore. But rules say that the cost can be hiked by five per cent at the level of engineer-in-chief or by a maximum of 10 per cent by the state.         
	Bijay Kumar, engineer-in-chief, road construction department, said that they would try negotiating with Ranchi-based Classic Coal Private Limited, owned by one Pawan Singh, the lowest bidder. We will try to make the agency agree to minimum costs. We cannot go beyond 10 per cent hike of the estimated cost, he said.         
	Sources at the Ranchi division of the national highway (NH) wing said three bidders  Classic Coal, Narayani Construction (Hazaribagh) and Khanna Construction (Ranchi)  had responded to the tender invited by the road department.        
	Rajesh Kumar Gupta, executive engineer of Ranchi division, said they had set a three-month deadline (from the date of awarding the contract) for completion of the much-needed diversion. But now, the authorities are in a fix because the rate quoted by the lowest bidder will further delay awarding of the contract.         
	The engineer-in-chief said that given the importance of the project, the department would, initially, arrange for funds from state coffers. Later, the Union ministry of surface transport and highways and Central Coalfields Limited (CCL) will be approached for reimbursement, he said.         
	Notably, the CCL has made it clear that the NH-33 and its adjoining forest areas are not its property and, so, the company cannot be held responsible for any damage caused. The company also claimed that it had already spent Rs 1.11 crore for firefighting at Kujju under corporate social responsibility, indicating that it might not be interested in shelling out more.        
	In another development, cost escalation has stalled work on five packages of Ranchi-Daltonganj road (NH-75). Tenders for widening and surface renewal schemes, which were actually sanctioned in 2007-08, were decided only recently. The project is worth about Rs 15 crore, but needs fresh approval.

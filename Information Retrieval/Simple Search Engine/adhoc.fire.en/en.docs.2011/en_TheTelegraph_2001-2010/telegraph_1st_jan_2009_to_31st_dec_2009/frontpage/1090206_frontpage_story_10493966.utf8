The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Knights terminate Shoaib 
                                                                                                           Knights terminate Shoaib 
  - Barring four under suspension, all Pak players off IPL list           SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                                                  
	Kolkata Knight Riders fans wont get to see the lip-smacking entry on the scorecard again, with Shah Rukh Khans team today terminating the Pakistani speedsters contract for the Indian Premier League, whose auction for Season II will take place in Goa tomorrow. The eight franchisees will pick 17 players from a pool of 50.         
	The IPL authorities had given the franchisees the option to either terminate or suspend the contracts of Pakistani cricketers. The players had been asked by Pakistan to stay away from the Twenty20 championship, slated to get under way from April 10.        
	With the exception of Umar Gul (Knight Riders), Misbah-ul-Haque (Bangalore), Sohail Tanvir and Kamran Akmal (both Rajasthan), all Pakistani players have had their contracts terminated.         
	The teams which have suspended the contracts can opt for replacements once the auction is over.        
	The Knight Riders, which had three Pakistanis in its ranks apart from Akhtar, terminated the contracts of Mohammed Hafeez and Salman Butt and suspended that of Gul.         
	We had only a years contract with Hafeez and we did not renew that. But we had to part ways with Akhtar and Butt, said Joy Bhattacharjya, team director of Knight Riders, but refused to spell out why.        
	Akhtar, though, can rest easy as he can claim to have won the big bang rivalry with Tendulkar. The wicket of the little master, out for a three-ball duck on May 16, 2008, will remain Akhtars last in the IPL, unless the temperamental cricketer offers himself for auction in future editions  governments permitting  and finds takers.         
	No Indian cricketer is among the 50 up for grabs tomorrow, with the hot picks being the English stars Kevin Pietersen, with a base price of $1.35 million, and Andrew Flintoff, who commands $950,000.         
	Pietersen stands to pip Mahendra Singh Dhoni as the most expensive player. The Indian skipper was bought by Chennai for a whopping $1.5 million last year.         
	The eight franchisees will spend a total of $13.59 million, with a cap of $2 million per team, tomorrow at the auction to be held at Fort Aguada. But since most of the teams have used up part of the money in purchasing full-time players in the run-up to the auction, only Chennai Super Kings is left with the full purse. Knight Riders has the smallest purse available, at $1.21 million.        
	The Calcutta team, which has eight overseas players of the 10 permitted and chose not to release Gul, can pick only one player.         
	Knight Riders sources said the team was eyeing the rising South African star J.P. Duminy and the exciting Australian fast bowler Shaun Tait.         
	Duminy will be preferred over Tait. If you see long-term, current form and availability, Duminy is the best bet, said the source.         
	Duminys base price is $300,000, but the added attraction is that he will be available for most of this tournament. The South African players are free after the home one-day series against Australia ends on April 17. In contrast, English players will be available only for the first three weeks of the league, while the Australians are likely to be free towards the end after they play Pakistan in an ODI series.         
	Pietersen is on the radar of the Bangalore Royal Challengers, and not just for cricketing reasons. Sources said franchisee owner Vijay Mallya sees Pietersen as crucial to the Kingfisher brands greater presence in the UK markets.        
	The IPL governing council is also mulling ways to widen the fan base of teams, which could see the Knight Riders playing a home match at Cuttack.         
	As a first step, the teams will be allowed to play one or all the matches in their catchment areas, though details have not been worked out yet. We also expect that if boards of other countries permit, teams like KKR, Chennai or Punjab may extend these catchment areas to a Dhaka or Lahore, IPL chairman Lalit Modi said.         
	Tied match        
	The IPL has decided to conform to the ICC Twenty20 rules for tied matches. In case of a tie, a one-over elimination contest would be held instead of the earlier bowl-outs.        
	Also, mid-season replacements will not be allowed this time.

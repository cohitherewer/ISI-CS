	New Delhi, July 6: The new pension scheme (NPS) should fly now that it has got the tax breaks.        
	The government today proposed to exempt income from NPS trust from income tax and dividend distribution tax.        
	All purchases sales of equity shares and derivatives by the NPS Trust will also be exempt from the securities transaction tax, said finance minister Pranab Mukherjee presented in Parliament today.        
	The finance minister also proposed to allow self-employed persons to participate in the NPS and avail themselves of the tax benefits.        
	The proposal to exempt income of the NPS Trust from income tax and any dividend paid to this trust from dividend distribution tax can give an impetus to the NPS, said Nitin Chopra, CEO of Bharti AXA Life Insurance Company Ltd.        
	This also provides Indian investors a much-needed tax benefit to plan for their retirement and patronise NPS, he said.        
	From the launch of the scheme till date, only 650 people have joined the scheme and a corpus of Rs 80 lakh has been accumulated.        
	The NPS is an important milestone in the development of a sustainable, efficient, voluntary and defined pension system in India, Mukherjee said.         
	The NPS was launched on May 1 to allow investment of up to 50 per cent of funds in stock markets. While the scheme was extended to all citizens it attracted a lukewarm response.         
	EET is imposed on tax-free savings when they are finally withdrawn.                           
	Underlining that NPS will continue to be subjected to the exempt-exempt-taxed method of tax treatment of savings, Mukherjee said it was proposed to provide necessary fiscal support to the NPS for the establishment this much-needed social security system.              
	Progress on the EET front would encourage long-term savings and insurance, said K.S. Gopalakrishnan, chief financial officer of AEGON Religare Life Insurance.        
	Subsidiaries of Reliance Capital, UTI, the State Bank of India, IDFC, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance and Kotak Mahindra Bank are offering the pension product at present.

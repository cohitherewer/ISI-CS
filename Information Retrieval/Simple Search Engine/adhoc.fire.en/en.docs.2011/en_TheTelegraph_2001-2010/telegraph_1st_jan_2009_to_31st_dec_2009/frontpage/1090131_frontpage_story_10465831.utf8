	Jan. 30: The US economy shrank at its fastest pace in a quarter century from October through December in the broadest accounting yet of the toll of the credit crisis.        
	President Barack Obama described the contraction as a continuing disaster for Americas families  the grim figures revealing astounding changes the downturn has brought about in everyday life in the worlds largest economy.        
	The decline is not just an economic concept. This is a continuing disaster for Americas families, Obama said, calling for the quick passage of his more than $800-billion economic stimulus package.        
	The recession is deepening and the urgency of our economic crisis is growing, Obama said. Yesterday, we reached a new threshold: the highest number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits on record.        
	The US commerce department reported that gross domestic product  the value of all goods and services produced in a country and the broadest barometer of economic health  shrivelled at an annual rate of 3.8 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2008.        
	It was the steepest quarterly contraction since early 1982  when America was mired in a deep downturn  and shows how a global credit crunch, a weak US real estate market and a decline in consumer spending have combined to undercut growth.        
	The decline was not as deep as analysts had expected, thanks to a $6.2 billion rise in inventories, but thats not being seen as good news.         
	The number suggests that businesses might ratchet back even more sharply in the current quarter, prolonging the year-old recession. The current January-March period will probably turn out to be the worst quarter for the recession, economists said.        
	The data that tracked the final three months of 2008  considered by many as annus horribilis  showed how life has changed in America.        
	Consumers and businesses cut back everywhere. Shoppers chopped spending on cars, furniture, appliances, clothes and other items. Businesses dropped the axe on equipment and software, home building and commercial construction. Overseas sales of US-made goods and services tanked as foreign buyers grappled with their own economic woes.        
	Businesses couldnt cut production fast enough in response to waning demand and got stuck with excess inventories, economists said, explaining the reason behind the less-than-expected contraction.        
	Battered consumers slashed spending so much that the cutback on non-durables (food and clothing) was the deepest since the end of 1950.        
	Americans newfound frugality was clearly visible. The savings rate rose to 2.9 per cent in the fourth quarter, up from 1.2 per cent in the third quarter and matched the rate in early 2002 when the country was still struggling to get back to full economic health after the 2001 recession.        
	India hope alive        
	In India, the government expressed the hope that the countrys economy would expand at the rate of 7 per cent despite the global slowdown.

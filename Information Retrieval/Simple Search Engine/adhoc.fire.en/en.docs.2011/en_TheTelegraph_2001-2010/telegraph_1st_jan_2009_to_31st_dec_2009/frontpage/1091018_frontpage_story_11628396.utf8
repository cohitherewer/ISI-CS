The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Diwali rest for Delhi distrust
                                                                                                           Diwali rest for Delhi distrust
          SANJAY K. JHA                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 17: Mamata Banerjee and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee may squirm at the idea of wishing each other Shubha Vijaya, but Diwali has melted some barriers in Delhi.        
	Sonia Gandhi today called L.K. Advani to greet him, and Advani rang up Manmohan Singh, whom he had personally targeted before the general election.        
	Courtesies such as Diwali greetings have often been forgotten in the current atmosphere of bitter political partisanship in Delhi. Holi, another festival that carries a message of goodwill, came and went before the Lok Sabha elections with no senior leader caring to greet another across the divide. That was a time when the weak PM versus strong leader debate was yet to be settled.        
	It was Singh who made the first gesture of civility early this month, visiting the BJP headquarters to express condolences after senior RSS leader Pyarelal Khandelwal passed away. This display of ordinary courtesy was an unexpected step given the Congress-BJP acrimony, although Singh had visited the BJP office also after S.S. Bhandaris death four years ago.        
	Sonia today bolstered Singhs efforts at cordiality by greeting Advani, who returned the gesture by wishing the Prime Minister.        
	In the past seven-eight years, top Congress and BJP politicians have avoided communicating with each other even on formal occasions. One casualty has been the tradition of rival leaders saying nice things about each other on the last day of each Parliament session.        
	All this contrasts with the way Indian and Pakistani security forces exchange greetings during festivals. BSF commandant S.H. Dhillon today handed over seven boxes of sweets and a big basket of fruits to Pakistan Rangers Wing Commander Mohammad Akbar Ali Bhatt at Attari.        
	But if greetings have been scarce in Delhis power corridors, not so gifts. Corporate sources say presents worth thousands of crores change hands during the festival in Delhi alone.        
	But the austerity debate constrained the gift market this year. Some of the younger MPs stuck notices at their homes saying: Gift de ke sharminda na karen (please dont embarrass us by offering gifts).        
	A BJP Rajya Sabha member, Prabhat Jha, created a flutter by returning liquor bottles sent by Vijay Mallya and writing the industrialist a strong letter. Some Left MPs too declined Mallyas gift. While the businessman had sent a single bottle of Black Dog whisky to some MPs, others got a pack of four bottles.

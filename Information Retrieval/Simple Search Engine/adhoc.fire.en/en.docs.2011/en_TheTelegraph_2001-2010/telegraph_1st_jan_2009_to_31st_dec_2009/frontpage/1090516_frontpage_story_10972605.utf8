  - Most politicians appear immune to defeat-induced depression: Experts           G.S. MUDUR                            Congress candidate Shekhar Suman performs puja at his Patna residence on Friday. (PTI)                                        
	New Delhi, May 15: The election results will throw up 543 winners and over 7,500 official losers. But unlike those who flunk tests elsewhere, most of the defeated candidates are unlikely to require any soothing as politicians in India appear immune to defeat-induced depression, say clinical and social psychologists.         
	Most politicians in India are likely to possess the mental wherewithal to cope with losing an election but, the experts say, some losers might feel better with an emotional balm.        
	The minds of most politicians are likely to be primed for the ups and downs of democracy, said L. Sam Sudheer Manickam, professor of clinical psychology at the JSS University Medical College, Mysore. A politician is also likely to have support systems in place  party colleagues or well-wishers  that, he said, might help smother any thoughts of woe that threaten to surface.        
	But scientists say some categories of politicians are likely to be particularly vulnerable to distress if they lose  those with high aspirations or those with inherently low self-esteem.        
	The most vulnerable to distress are going to be politicians whore hinging on this election completely, said Sujatha Sharma, a clinical psychologist in New Delhi, and a member of the Indian Association of Clinical Psychologists.        
	Those who dont have a post-poll plan (after a defeat) are going to be hit the hardest, Sharma said. People who havent made a realistic assessment of likely outcomes are also likely to be affected.        
	But there could be some politicians for whom the pursuit of power and control through public office is an attempt to compensate for inherently low self-esteem. When such people lose, their self-esteem plunges further, she said.        
	Reactions to defeat among professionals who plunged into electoral battle  from an airline executive to a dancer to a banker  are likely to vary. Some professionals who may have had idealistic notions of bringing about change, and had high expectations from the public in the belief that they were different from other politicians, may feel a deep sense of pain, said Rajat Mitra, a clinical psychologist in New Delhi.        
	Some professionals may have had realistic expectations of outcomes, acknowledging to themselves that their lack of connection with voters at the grassroots level would be a handicap, Sharma said.        
	Sometimes, the level of trauma might also depend on the personality. A person already predisposed to mood swings because of underlying personality is likely to experience a fresh low after a defeat, Manickam said.        
	The emotional distress could show up in the form of withdrawal, anxiety, aggressiveness, insomnia and  in severe cases  depression. Some politicians become aggressive, and display anger more frequently than before, said Mitra.        
	Psychiatrists say politicians who have been rejected by voters should get themselves to accept defeat. Friends and family members may be able to provide empathetic ears, said Sudeep Shroff, a psychotherapist based in Surat, Gujarat.        
	Mitra said a low level of sensitivity to perceptions expressed by others  which has emerged as a prerequisite for participation in the political process in India  might also allow politicians to cope with electoral defeats.        
	If you look at the political environment today, you see personal attacks and crude language among strategies of trying to influence voters, Mitra said. Low sensitivity allows a person to endure this as well as cope with losing elections. The greater the sensitivity of an individual, the greater is the mental trauma.

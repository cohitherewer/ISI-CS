                                                                                                           Soniaji, it aint on till they sing
  - Band of sari-clad cheerleaders a fixture at Delhi meet          ANANYA SENGUPTA                            The band of cheerleaders at a rally                                         
	New Delhi, May 6: No skimpy skirts, only sober saris.        
	The cheergirls on the cricket fields of the Twenty-20 league may be a huge draw in their tiny garb, but a band in Delhi has shown you can hold the crowd in saris, too. You dont need to wiggle your hips either.        
	Meet Sudhanshu Bahuguna and his young group of singers.        
	Bahuguna heads the Congresss cheerleading team and his job doesnt end till Sonia Gandhi takes the stage every time to address a public meeting in the capital.        
	His band of 24 youths arrives at the rally ground hours before the Congress team and keeps the crowd on its feet with nationalist songs before the political heavyweights take centre stage.        
	It was a chance opportunity 10 years ago that landed Bahuguna and his band the job.        
	A Congress womens conference was to be held in Delhi and the party was looking for a band that could not only compose a song on women but also sing it at the venue. Sonia Gandhi was expected at the conference and party workers wanted to make a good impression. We created a song for them in one-and-a-half hours, recalled Bahuguna, 43, who started the band Swartrishna in 1989.        
	They wanted Indirajis (Indira Gandhi) name in the lyrics, and we had it even before they actually made the request. They were very happy.        
	Bahuguna and his group havent looked back after that.        
	Since 1999, the band has been a prominent feature in every rally the Congress chief has addressed in Delhi. It has also composed seven to eight songs in the memory of Rajiv Gandhi which they sang in Sonias presence during one of his birth anniversary celebrations.        
	Nahin hain aap aaj haamare saath, lekin hum sab karte hain apko yaad (you are not with us now, but we all remember you), is one of Sonias favourite lyrics the band has composed.        
	Yesterday, before Rahul Gandhi reached a meeting ground, it was Bahuguna and his group of young men and women, in orange and off white saris and kurta-pyjama, who kept the spirits up as the crowd waited for the young leader in the sweltering heat of Delhi.        
	If these people didnt sing, the rally would have been boring. I sing with them since they sing old songs and I can feel the passion ignite inside me. The fun of the rally is because of them, said 75-year-old Shahbano Begum, who waited for an hour for Rahul to arrive.        
	Bahuguna concedes that singing at rallies is difficult. With the heat, coupled with lack of drinking water, it becomes difficult to keep the spirits of the crowd up. My band members have often fainted and have to be treated for heat stroke. The girls often rue that their skin tone turns darker with each rally.        
	But heat, toil and thirst are all forgotten when the appreciation pours in.        
	Bahuguna recalled an instance when the late Sunil Dutt approached him and praised his choice of songs. He said the environment we created at the rally reminded him of his college days. He said the deshbhakti songs had moved him to tears and demanded that I record a cassette for him of songs sung by my band.        
	Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit, Bahuguna said, personally keeps an eye on them, even in the middle of hectic rallies. She always comes and asks us if we have the things we need for the rally, said the singer who also composed the Congresss theme song for last years Assembly elections.        
	Although the band has performed once for former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee at a BJP conference in Patiala, it has not sung for any other political party.        
	Their heart is with the Congress, Bahuguna said.        
	Music, said the bard, was the food of love? Seems its the right starter too before a mouthful of politics.

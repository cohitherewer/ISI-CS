          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranchi, Nov. 2: Tender anomalies have stalled the purchase of bulletproof supplements for the police, in what is a blow for the security forces now gearing up for a prolonged offensive against Maoists in Jharkhand and neighbouring states.        
	Last week, while hearing a plea filed by Star Wire Industries  it supplies equipment to the defence ministry  alleging fixing of the tender by the purchase committee of the state home department, the Jharkhand High Court clamped a stay on the supply of the crucial equipment.        
	Star Wire alleged that Swastik Softech Limited, which was earlier rejected, was wrongly awarded the contract to supply bulletproof observation tower, sentry post and mobile morchas to the police.        
	Star Wire alleged Swastik Softech was unduly favoured by the purchase committee that ought not to have decided on the technical specifications, which had to be cleared by the technical committee constituted for the purpose.                    
	The court has now ordered the state to explain its position by the second week of November when the case would be taken up again.        
	Star Wire said it was the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of the fabrication of bulletproof articles used by the ministry of defence, adding that it had been certified by the Directorate General Quality Assurance (DGQA).        
	Also, while Star Wire claimed to have presented its products for testing, the other bidders, including Swastik Softech, did not pass on samples for testing or comparison.

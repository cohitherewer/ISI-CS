The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | ED team to quiz Koda
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                ED team to quiz Koda
          RUDRA BISWAS                              
	Ranchi, Dec. 4: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is sending a team to Ranchi next week to question former chief minister Madhu Koda and his one-time ministerial colleague Kamlesh Singh, both lodged in Birsa Munda Central Jail on charges of accumulating assets disproportionate to their known sources of income.        
	Once the ED team reaches Ranchi, they will be joined by officials from the state vigilance bureau and the income tax department, said a source associated with the state agency, indicating that a series of joint meetings were on the cards to exchange information on the various documents seized during raids conducted on Kodas properties.        
	The former chief minister, who has been accused of using illegal means, including hawala channels, to amass wealth to the tune of Rs 2,000 crore, was arrested after he ignored summons from the vigilance and income tax authorities on the pretext of campaigning in the elections where he has fielded seven nominees, including his wife, under the banner of a new party, Jai Bharat Samanta Party.        
	Vigilance and income tax officials are now preparing a questionnaire to be given to Koda and Singh.        
	The Enforcement Directorate has also initiated moves to impound the passport of Vinod Sinha, a close aide of Koda and alleged kingpin of the scam, who has been evading arrest for over a month now. According to sources, Sinha was still in the country, while another Koda aide, Sanjay Choudhury, was hiding in Dubai.        
	The vigilance has charged the duo under the Prevention of Corruption Act and under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code relating to cheating, criminal conspiracy and criminal breach of trust.         
	Besides, the Enforcement Directorate has already filed FIRs against Koda, Singh and others under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. We are now going through the documents seized in the raids so that a comprehensive action plan can be thrashed out to nail the accused, IG (vigilance) M.V. Rao said.                          
	Another former minister facing corruption charges, Bandhu Tirkey, appeared before the vigilance for interrogation today and pleaded innocence. But the agency did not buy his argument. We are verifying the information given by Tirkey. We have also sought clarifications on several documents he has submitted, Rao added.        
	However, yet another former minister Bhanu Pratap Shahi, who was to appear for interrogation today, failed to surface.

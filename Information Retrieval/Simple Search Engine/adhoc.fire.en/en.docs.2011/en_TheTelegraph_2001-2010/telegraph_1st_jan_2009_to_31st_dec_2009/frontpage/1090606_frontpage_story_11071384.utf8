          SANTOSH K. KIRO                              
	Ranchi, June 5: Inspired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs development road map with a 100-day deadline, Raj Bhavan has ordered department secretaries to come up with similar plans.        
	According to the order, each department has to come up with a concrete work plan, which they would execute within a 100-day deadline. And in case they failed to fulfil the work plan, secretaries would be answerable to the Governor.         
	I informed department secretaries to come up with a concrete work plan. The state has an annual Plan outlay of Rs 8,250 crore and projects have to be carried out within this stipulated amount by all departments. The 100-day work plan will enable faster execution under the Plan (development) head, G. Krishnan, the advisor to Governor Syed Sibtey Razi, told The Telegraph.         
	At the Centre, Manmohan Singh introduced the novel idea of the roadmap for his own cabinet after assuming charge for the second consecutive term. Even President Pratibha Patil, in her address to a joint session of the two Houses yesterday, spoke of the 100-day UPA target.         
	In Jharkhand, Krishnan held a meeting with secretaries yesterday and asked them to submit a plan in two to three days time. Plans would be routed through the office of the development commissioner, S.K. Choudhary, to the Raj Bhavan which would then monitor the progress for the following 100 days.         
	The departments are really busy now making the 100-day work plan. Some departments are already in the last lap of planning, said Choudhary.         
	Krishnan has asked the secretaries to prioritise work that can be executed by the state alone. Projects, which involve the Centre and are hence not entirely in the hands of the state, have to be kept in the second list. Even the revenue department has been asked to maximise collections. Without the aid of the revenue development, work may not progress, Krishnan said.        
	Departments are busy at work. In our work plan, we are focusing on the projects that are already on. We have alerted all employees about the target, said Marianus Ekka, the under secretary of the animal husbandry department.         
	The rural works department convened a meeting today to chart out the plan. Similarly, departments of rural development, panchayati raj, national rural employment programme, urban development, co-operative development, labour, employment and housing are equally busy.        
	A few days ago, Raj Bhavan had asked departments to recruit at least 1 lakh staff in vacant posts by the next three months.         
	Krishnan, at a meting with secretaries, had asked the personnel secretary to discuss the issue with the Jharkhand State Public Service Commission to put the process on the fast track.

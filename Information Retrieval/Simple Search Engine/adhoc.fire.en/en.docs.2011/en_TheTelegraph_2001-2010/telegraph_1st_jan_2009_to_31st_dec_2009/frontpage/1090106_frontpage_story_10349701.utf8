	New Delhi, Jan. 5: India today gave Islamabad what it has demanded for weeks: purported evidence of a Pakistani link to the Mumbai siege that foreign diplomats described as strong and convincing.        
	Simultaneously, New Delhi launched a diplomatic blitz to bring global pressure on Pakistan to act on the information provided and hand the suspects over.        
	Foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon handed over what he later described as materials from the ongoing investigations to Pakistan high commissioner Shahid Malik in Delhi. The same dossier was passed on to Pakistan foreign secretary Salman Bashir by Indian high commissioner Satyabrata Pal in Islamabad.        
	Islamabad said it was evaluating the information materials but again urged a joint probe for evidence that was legally scrutable, perhaps implying what it received today was not.        
	A senior Pakistani official told The Telegraph the dossier contained nothing new other than what had appeared in the media, and didnt amount to proof.        
	Foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee wrote to several of his counterparts about the evidence and officials briefed the envoys of 14 countries whose nationals were killed.        
	US ambassador David C. Mulford said America fully supported India and would pursue this matter to its conclusion. Period. He added: The level of co-operation of the FBI is very, very significant.        
	India presented a very strong case, PTI quoted Australian high commissioner John McCarthy as saying. The agency also quoted an unnamed diplomat from another country, who said he was convinced by the evidence.        
	The probe details were shared also with the visiting Chinese vice-foreign minister, He Yafei. More mission heads will be briefed tomorrow.        
	The dossier mentions the confessions of Ajmal Kasab including details of his Pakistani trainers and handlers and his last visit home in Faridkot, sources said.        
	It contains transcripts and tapes of the gunmens conversation with Lashkar-e-Toiba commanders Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, Zarar Shah and Muzameel in Urdu and Punjabi. Data from seized GPS and satellite phones track the attackers journey from Karachi by sea, and their conversations with handlers in Pakistan and PoK.        
	Officials said Kasabs DNA samples might be handed over at a later stage.        
	Menon hinted at a role by elements in the Pakistani establishment, echoing home minister P. Chidambaram who yesterday said he would presume the attackers were state actors or state-assisted actors until the contrary is proved.        
	The foreign secretary said: Its hard to believe that something of this scale, that took so long in the preparation, and of this nature, which amounts really to a commando attack, could occur without anyone in the establishment knowing.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | MP alleges leak
                                                                                                           MP alleges leak
                            
	Ranchi: Perturbed over BJP allegations that the state budget was leaked to sections of the media, Governor Syed Sibtey Razi first toyed with the idea of ordering a vigilance probe, but later put it on hold since the issue was raised in the Lok Sabha.        
	Finance secretary Rajbala Verma is in the national capital and has explained the objections raised in the Hou se. We will look into it if the Centre asks us to, a Raj Bhavan official said.         
	After the budget was presented in the Lok Sabha by Union minister of state for finance Namo Narayan Meena, BJP MP Yashwant Sinha alleged it had been published  along with the provisions  in a Ranchi daily a few days ago. This shows how the state was functioning under Presidents rule in Jharkhand, the Hazaribagh MP said. Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said he was taking the issue very seriously.        
	A Hindi daily reported on July 6 that the budget had been hiked by Rs 992.3 crore. There was no mention of the allocations to departments, a finance department source clarified.

	New Delhi, March 18: An anti-India political outfit in Sri Lanka has resented the presence of the Indian military-medical mission in the island nation. But Colombo has assured Delhi that the team of doctors and medics from the Armed Forces Medical Corps is welcome and will be protected.         
	The problem is that the government did not tell us that the doctors were not civilian but from the army, an independent non-government worker told The Telegraph over phone from Colombo.         
	We welcome them in any case but we wish the government was transparent. The situation being what it is, any kind of medical help is desperately needed and they are indeed welcome, she said, requesting anonymity.         
	The 52-member team was flown into Colombo on March 11 by an Indian Air Force IL-76 transporter and driven to Pulmoddai in the islands north-east, about 49km from the port of Trincomalee. They have written guarantees that they will be given security by the Sri Lanka Navy.         
	We are prepared for some resentment but our primary concern is to give medical relief to the civilians who are the victims. Our mission is to keep the engagement with the non-combatants who are the victims, said a senior defence ministry official in New Delhi.         
	The mission coincided with political pressure from Tamil Nadu where Jayalalithaa went on a days fast demanding Indian intervention in Sri Lanka in aid of Tamils who are caught between the guns of the LTTE and the Lankan armed forces. The Sri Lankan government decided that the Indian field medical unit would set up camp in Pulmoddai (an adaptation of the Tamil word meaning tigers den.)         
	Indias assessment is that the Lankan army is making incremental progress, and is some 56sqkm from pinning down the LTTE, in the north of Mulaitivu in the ongoing military offensive.         
	An estimated 40,000 people escaped the cross-fire since January 21 till last week, and humanitarian situation is getting worse. Various estimates even now put 1.5 lakh people being trapped in the area.         
	For example, of the 142 people who reached the Indian-run hospital among the recent evacuees, 136 were surgical cases. Delhi intends to increase the capacity of the hospital, and will request for sending more food supply as well. The food supply to the area, sources said, is 1/8th of what it used to be earlier.        
	This is the first intervention by the Indian forces  though through its medical wing  in the middle of the war in 22 years. But the armed forces medical wing was involved in taking relief to Sri Lanka after the tsunami during a ceasefire between the Tamil Tigers and the Lankan armed forces in 2004-05. Even the Tamil Tigers had praised the role of the Indian medics then.         
	But yesterday the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, a political party primarily based in the Lankan south which campaigns against alleged Indian expansionism, charged the Lankan government with being untruthful about the conditions under which they allowed the Indian medical mission.         
	JVP parliamentary group leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake told Parliament that the Indian Armys mobile hospital in Pulmoddai was a threat to the sovereignty and national security of Sri Lanka.         
	The Indian medical team comprises 52 doctors, paramedics, and support staff that reached Lanka on March 11. They have been asked to abandon their official uniforms and work in plainclothes. Indian military doctors and paramedics in Afghanistan also work in the same way.        
	Dissanayake was reported to have said that the Pulmoddai area had mineral deposits and was strategically important. He asked the Lankan government to explain if the Indian government was invited to set up a hospital or whether Delhi took the initiative. The leader wondered if other foreign governments were going to follow suit.

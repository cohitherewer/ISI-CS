The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Indians DNA war with Britain
                                                                                                           Indians DNA war with Britain
          AMIT ROY                            Chakrabarti: Rights battle                                  
	London, May 7: Shami Chakrabarti, director of Liberty, a human rights group, has today attacked the UK government again  this time for allowing police to hold the DNA details of innocent people for up to 12 years.        
	Last month Chakrabarti was also at the centre of a row following a police raid on the House of Commons office of Tory MP Damien Green to discover the identity of a person in the home office passing him sensitive documents on immigration.        
	Green revealed that when the police searched his files and computer data, they let slip they were also looking to find out whether there was any kind of link between himself and Chakrabarti.        
	The revelation outraged Chakrabarti who said the police operation raised very serious questions about their modus operandi.        
	There is no suggestion she was in any way involved in the leaks. But Green disclosed that the Liberty directors name was used as a keyword by officers going through his emails and computer when his parliamentary office was searched in November last year.        
	Green, who is the Conservative immigration spokesperson, said at the time: This feels to me like a fishing expedition on somebody who embarrasses the government of the day. Thats very disturbing. To have the police searching for contacts between Opposition politicians and civil liberties campaigners isnt something anyone should feel comfortable with.        
	The UK-born daughter of a Calcutta couple  her politically conscious father (Mintoo) was a book-keeper and accountant, her mother a shop assistant  who had emigrated like so many others to London, went on television and demanded an explanation from the police.        
	If the police had any questions for me they could have just picked up the phone and asked, Chakrabarti said.        
	It is not hard to work out why the police would want to get hold of more information on Chakrabarti for she has been a persistent critic of theBritish government on whether civil liberties were being eroded in the attempt to tackle terrorism  a problem all governments, including Indias, have to confront in the real world.        
	If the idea had been to encourage Chakrabarti to moderate her attacks on the government, this has clearly failed for today she criticised the authorities over how long DNA records should be held. In fact, civil liberty groups are threatening to take the government to court.        
	Under British law everyone is deemed innocent until proved to be guilty but there are shades in between over which there is disagreement between the government and the police on one hand and civil liberty groups on the other.        
	Anyone arrested by the police but released without charge ought, in theory, to have the slate wiped clean but in practice this is not so.        
	The assumption is that anyone who is arrested might commit a crime in the future, so from the police point of view it makes sense to keep that persons DNA on record.        
	The police add that keeping the DNA of people, who were arrested and released without charge but then went on to commit an offence, helped them to solve more than 17,000 crimes last year.        
	However, human rights judges in Strasbourg have ruled that the British governments blanket policy is a breach of the right to privacy.        
	New home office proposals would see anyone arrested for a minor offence but later released having their profile stored for six years, unless they are rearrested. Suspects held for sexual and violent offences who are not charged will stay on the database for 12 years. Under-18s who are arrested will have their profiles deleted when they become adults unless they commit multiple or serious crimes.        
	The profiles of all convicted criminals will remain on the database indefinitely.        
	Chakrabarti said today the new proposals were disproportionate and could lead to abuses of the system. These proposals are not quite two fingers to the European Court of Human Rights but they come pretty close. They dont distinguish between people who are under suspicion, people who are wholly innocent and those who are guilty.        
	The debate over how to balance the need to crack down on terrorists while preserving the traditional freedoms of a democratic society has acute relevance for a country like India.        
	Chakrabarti was backed by Tory shadow home secretary Chris Grayling who commented: The government just doesnt get this. People in Britain should be innocent until proven guilty. Ministers are just trying to get away with as little as they possibly can instead of taking real action to remove innocent people from the DNA database.        
	Its just not good enough.

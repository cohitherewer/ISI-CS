	London, June 5: None of the debris found so far in the Atlantic Ocean was from the Air France Airbus that disappeared on Monday, Brazilian military officials have said.         
	We have not recovered any parts of the aeroplane so far, Ramon Borges Cardoso, the director of the Brazilian air space control department, was quoted as saying.        
	An air force official confirmed Cardosos statement.        
	Cardoso also said the fuel slicks were not caused by jet fuel but by oil believed to have come from a passing ship.        
	The French government expressed deep dissapointment over the news.         
	Transportation minister Dominique Bussereau urged extreme prudence about judging the source of any debris that was recovered until it could be properly analysed. He said it was bad news that the Brazilian teams were mistaken. We would have preferred that it had come from the plane and that we had some information.        
	Earlier on Thursday, Cardoso had told reporters that navy ships 600 miles off Brazils shore had pulled aboard debris from the Air France plane, including a pallet from its cargo hold and two buoys.         
	But after inspection it was determined the pallet could not have come from the plane.         
	We confirm that the pallet found is not part of the debris of the plane. Its a pallet that was in the area, but considered more to be trash, Cardoso said. The pallet was made of wood, he said, and the Air France Airbus A330 that vanished on Monday did not have any wooden pallets on board.         
	Thats how we can confirm that the pallet isnt part of the remains of the aircraft.         
	He added that the Brazilian navy crew were pulling any item out of the water and inspecting it. Anything not belonging to the Air France plane was being put aside.

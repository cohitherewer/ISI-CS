The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Chief minister, heres what ails your government
                                                                                                           Chief minister, heres what ails your government
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, July 8: Bengals hospitals are bursting at the seams. So is the health minister  with pride.        
	The overcrowding in state-run hospitals, with two to three patients in one bed, is testimony to the good service being rendered by such facilities, Bengal health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra suggested today.        
	You are saying patients are lying on the floor. There are two-three patients in one bed. Hospitals are getting overcrowded. From this, it is clear that patients are going to government hospitals because of the service they get. They get good service. Thats why they are going there, Mishra told the Opposition in the Assembly.        
	Mishra is not just health minister in the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government. He also presides over the panchayat and rural development department, which deals with a key constituency that seems to be increasingly deserting the Left Front.        
	Like rural development, health is an issue that touches a raw nerve in Bengal  its state-run hospitals symbols of resource crunch and apathy. The land controversy lit the spark for the Lefts electoral flameout but many believe that the combustible atmosphere was created by years of callousness, especially in areas like government hospitals where people come in direct contact with the wings of the state.        
	But Mishra feels little is achieved by playing the broken record. You keep harping on the same things. Speak also about the hard work the doctors are putting in, Mishra told the Opposition while replying to the debate on the health budget in the Assembly.        
	The Trinamul Congresss Dulal Bar, who raised the issue of patients lying on the floor, said the minister was probably unaware that poor people were flocking to such hospitals as they did not have a choice. Look at the condition of government hospitals. Cats and dogs move around and doctors or nurses are not to be seen. The condition of patients is pathetic and this is common knowledge.        
	A doctor in a government hospital in Calcutta reacted to the ministers statement with disbelief. I cant believe he said people flock to government hospitals because they think the service is good. Its only because they cannot afford private healthcare.        
	The orthopaedist added: We cannot provide proper services with people lying on the floor. The health minister knows the scenario very well, being a doctor himself.        
	At NRS Medical College and Hospital, a surgeon said people often returned home with diseases contracted from the wards. I am astonished that the government considers this a healthy healthcare system. Proper healthcare also needs proper infrastructure. We lack terribly in terms of infrastructure.        
	Agreed a patient who has been made to lie on the floor on a bed sheet for want of a bed in a ward at NRS. I am here only because I cannot go to a nursing home and not because I think the medical care offered here is better, said Sunil Sahu, from Narendrapur, who is suffering from acute stomach pain.

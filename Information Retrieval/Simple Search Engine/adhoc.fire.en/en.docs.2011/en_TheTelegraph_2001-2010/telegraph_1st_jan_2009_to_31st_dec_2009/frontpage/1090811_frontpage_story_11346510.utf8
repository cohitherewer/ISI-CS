	New Delhi, Aug. 10: The rainfall deficit has worsened, prompting the Centre to plan higher sugar and pulses imports and a restive Congress to hark back to a thrust area during the Rajiv Gandhi era.        
	The sense of urgency became acute after the meteorological department revised the monsoon shortfall to 28 per cent from 25 per cent.        
	A contingency blueprint being drawn up by officials proposes higher sugar and pulses imports, a ban on edible oil exports and curbs on futures trading in commodities whose prices are rising fast.         
	Besides affecting the paddy crop  the government has said grain stocks are sufficient as of now  the scanty rain is expected to lower sugar output. India may have to import 3 to 4 million tonnes sugar  international prices have begun rising in anticipation of higher demand from India.        
	Unlike earlier years, India may not be able to depend on an unlikely source: Pakistan. Despite the outward bitterness in ties, India has often sourced sugar from Pakistan but prices are rising there too because of a feared shortage.        
	Its the same with pulses. Myanmar, another source India may not like to crow about, is apparently under pressure because of a surge in domestic demand. This will force India to tap other markets abroad.        
	India needs 18 million tonnes of pulses a year but its production fell short by 3.4 million tonnes last year because of water shortage in central India. This year, fears of more water scarcity has shrunk the acreage by 10 per cent.        
	This is where the Congress has stepped in with advice to try out Rajiv Gandhis oilseeds experiment on pulses and sugar. The oilseeds technology mission during the 1980s, with thrust on drought-prone areas, had helped output rise by 85 per cent but the growth later slumped to 30 per cent.        
	The government must launch programmes on the lines of Rajivjis oilseeds mission to increase the production of pulses and sugar, chief Congress spokesperson Janardhan Dwivedi said. Twenty years ago, when India faced the worst drought since Independence, we had none of the problems we face today.        
	The Congress is worried that left unchecked, the rising prices would spoil the mood during the approaching festival season. Elections are expected in Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Haryana this year.        
	Ministers are first and foremost ministers for eradication of poverty and not for preoccupying themselves with the corporate sector, another Congress leader said, alluding to the petroleum ministry controversy involving the Ambani brothers.        
	In 2006, when the prices of essentials started to rise  pulses then cost Rs 40 against Rs 90 a kg now  Sonia Gandhi had called a CWC meeting and pressed the government to initiate action. This time too she is likely to convene the CWC and a session of the chief ministers of Congress-ruled states to send a similar message, party sources said.        
	Reports from Radhika Ramaseshan, Jayanta Roy Chowdhury and R. Suryamurthy

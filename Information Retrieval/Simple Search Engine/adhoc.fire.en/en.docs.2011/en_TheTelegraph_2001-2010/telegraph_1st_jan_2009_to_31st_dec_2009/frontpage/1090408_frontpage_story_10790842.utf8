                                                                                                           PM stokes a debate on road not taken
  - Rain washes away Singh rally in Dibrugarh          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Dibrugarh, April 7: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today flew back to Delhi shortly after landing in Dibrugarh when rain made it impossible for his chopper to take off for his meeting venue, giving the Opposition an opportunity to chew on the reasons why he could not take the road.        
	Singh arrived at Mohanbari airport here on schedule, around 11.28am, and was to take a chopper ride to the meeting venue at Chowkidingee playground  a distance of just 15km by road.         
	Though chief minister Tarun Gogoi explained that Singh could not have travelled by road because of his health condition, the AGP said the decision not to take the road route only served to expose the deteriorating law and order scenario in the state.        
	When this government is not confident of providing security to the Prime Minister, how can it provide security to the common people? AGP chief Chandra Mohan Patowary asked in Guwahati.         
	He claimed that earlier, President Prathiba Patil, too, could not visit Kaziranga as the state government could not assure her enough security.        
	A source said the state government did not want to take any chances with the nations most protected person by taking him by road on a day when Ulfa was observing its raising day and there had already been a string of blasts.         
	Since the state government did not want the Prime Minister to travel by road, the Special Protection Group (SPG) also opined likewise. So the road option was dropped, he said.        
	However, officially, the state government maintained that bad weather and health concerns were why Singh did not take the road.         
	PCC spokesperson Pradyut Bordoloi also told reporters at Mohanbari airport that the decision to avoid the road was purely on health grounds.        
	Recuperating from his critical heart ailments, the Prime Minister was to attend his first poll rally organised by the Assam PCC at the Chowkidingee playground in Dibrugarh. Health is the lone reason for not taking the road option, nothing beyond that. Please do not try to read much into this, Bordoloi said.         
	Singh waited impatiently in the VVIP lounge of the airport for around one-and-a-half hours in the hope that the weather might clear.         
	Chief minister Tarun Gogoi, PCC President Bhubaneswar Kalita, senior Congress leader Chandan Bagchi and party candidate from Dibrugarh, Paban Singh Ghatowar, kept him company.         
	When the rains showed no signs of relenting till 1pm, Singh returned to Delhi by the same aircraft.        
	The Prime Minister, who is a Rajya Sabha representative from Assam, was to campaign for Ghatowar, who has been representing the Dibrugarh seat since 1991. He was defeated by AGPs Sarbananda Sonowal in 2004.

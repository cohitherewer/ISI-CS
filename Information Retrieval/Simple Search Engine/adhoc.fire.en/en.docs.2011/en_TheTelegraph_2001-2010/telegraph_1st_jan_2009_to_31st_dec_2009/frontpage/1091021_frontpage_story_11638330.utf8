          OUR BUREAU                              
	Ranchi/Hazaribagh, Oct. 20: Three persons, including a senior member of a rival faction, were killed in a CPI(Maoist) strike in Chatra, about 250km from the capital, early today. A 12-year-old girl and two policemen were among seven others injured.        
	Around 1am, a rebel squad armed with AK-47 and AK-56 rifles opened fire on Rajapur Bazaar School grounds in Rajpur village, where some members of Sashastra Peoples Morcha (SPM)  an anti-Maoist outfit apparently backed by the police  were enjoying a cultural programme as a part of extended Diwali festivities.        
	District police superintendent Deo Bihar Sharma said SPM central committee secretary Umesh Manjhi was the main target. He took eight bullets. The two other victims were caught in the firing, he said, but denied police association with the SPM.        
	According to witnesses, though only a couple of armed rebels attacked 35-year-old Manjhi, there were more than 100 hiding near the village. The two Maoists were in uniform and carried an AK-47 and an AK-56. They were being covered by a hidden group of over 100. This became evident when we heard voices raising slogans in favour of the movement after the barely two-minute operation, said a witness.         
	Besides Manjhi, the two other deceased have been identified as local Congress leader and district president of Bhokta Samaj Umesh Singh Bhokta (45) and villager Ranjeet Kumar Rajak (25). Bhokta was shot from close range. He took five bullets.        
	The injured include constable Rewalal Mahto, police driver Manoj Yadav and 12-year-old Soni Kumari. They have been admitted to Sadar hospital.        
	Sources said the SPM had been active against Maoists in Chatra for two years.         
	It is also learnt that rebel bullets had felled Manjhis elder brother, Dabloo, last year. Dabloo was a former Maoist, a local resident said.        
	 Sharma said a joint team of police and CRPF were combing the area.        
	Mine owners killing        
	Lohardaga police have zeroed in on the Sanjay Yadav gang for the murder of bauxite mine owner Mahendra Mittal in the district headquarters late on Monday evening.         
	Sanjay, a former Maoist area commander, was also involved in the abduction of six Hindalco employees in August.         
	Tractor torched        
	A Maoist squad led by a woman targeted house of a JMM leader, Amrit Joy Kujur, at Kurund village, about 120km from the state capital, in Mahuadand of Latehar district, around 1am today and set his tractor on fire.

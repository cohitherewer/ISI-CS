	New Delhi, June 13: BJP vice-president Yashwant Sinha today stepped down from all posts in the party, alleging that the BJP was putting a premium on failure after its defeat in the general election.        
	Party president Rajnath Singh promptly accepted his resignation and gagged all functionaries from speaking about internal affairs in public to salvage the image of the party whose power struggles are being fought through the media.        
	In a five-page letter leaked to the media, Sinha said a detailed review would be instructive and show us the path for the future and help us establish accountability.        
	He rued that the BJP was shying away from a systematic appraisal of its performance. In a tangential reference to Arun Jaitley, the campaign in-charge, and Sudheendra Kulkarni, L.K. Advanis key aide, he said: those who were responsible for the management of the campaign have already made their views public  drawn their conclusions, apportioned blame and given themselves a clean chit.        
	In the past week, Jaitley and Kulkarni have been slammed by veterans Jaswant Singh and Arun Shourie for the same reason.        
	Sinha lauded Advani for wishing to make a fine example of accountability by refusing to become the leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha. But he attacked his loyalists for persuading him to change his mind so that their own little perch is not disturbed.        
	Alluding to Jaitleys anointment as Rajya Sabha Opposition leader and of Sushma Swaraj as Lok Sabha deputy Opposition leader, he wrote: In our anxiety to distribute amongst the few high mortals whatever goodies were available, we completely disregarded the parliamentary party constitution in the election of the office-bearers  on May 31. It is difficult to avoid the impression that in the BJP we put a premium on failure.        
	BJP and RSS sources said two issues could be at the nub: forced to sit in Opposition, the leaders had scrambled for whatever constitutional posts they could grab.        
	Sources said most Advani faithfuls had netted the posts that matter. Apart from Sushma and Jaitley, they include S.S. Ahluwalia, the deputy leader in the Upper House, and Ramesh Bais, the chief whip in the Lok Sabha.        
	The second sub-text looks ahead to the 2014 election when it would be time to project a prime ministerial face. With the RSS telling Advani to demit office as Opposition leader by 2009-end, Sushma is poised to take over. Rajnath has to make way for a successor around September.        
	But Rajnath wants the party constitution amended to give the incumbent president another term. If he does not get an extension, sources said the RSS might press to make him the Opposition leader instead of Sushma so that Advanis stranglehold is broken. The Sangh could then push its nominee to head the BJP.        
	While the lobby against Advani looks disparate, insiders said Jaswant, Sinha and Shourie had made common cause to not allow Advani and his loyalists to seize the reins of leadership. Tactically, they have not targeted Advani but Jaitley, seen as his surrogate.        
	It is unclear if this loose group is aligned with Rajnath, has the Sanghs blessings or is acting on its own.

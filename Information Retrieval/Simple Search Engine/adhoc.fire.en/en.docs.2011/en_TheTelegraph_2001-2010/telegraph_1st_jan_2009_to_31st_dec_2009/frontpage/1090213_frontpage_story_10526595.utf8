                                                                                                           Facebook claim
                            Zuckerberg                            
	London, Feb. 13: A law firm has let slip that Facebook paid $65m to settle a lawsuit claiming that founder Mark Zuckerberg stole the idea for the website from former college room-mates.         
	Quinn Emanuel Urquhart Oliver amp; Hedges boasted in a January advertising brochure about outcomes of an array of cases it handled last year, including the multi-million-dollar settlement from Facebook.         
	The Recorder, a California legal publication, yesterday published a story about the leak. Quinn Emanuel lawyers represented ConnectU in a lawsuit that ended in a settlement endorsed by a federal judge in the Silicon Valley city of San Jose in June of last year. The financial terms of the settlement were edited from court documents and not disclosed by Facebook.

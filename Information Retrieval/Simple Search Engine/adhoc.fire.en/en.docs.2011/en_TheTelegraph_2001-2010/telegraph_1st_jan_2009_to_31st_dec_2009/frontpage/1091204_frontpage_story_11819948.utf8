	The joint chief electoral officer said the Election Commission of India had been requested to order repoll in four booths  two each in Dumri and Gandey constituency.         
	The recommendations were made by the poll panel officials after consulting the observers. Criminals destroyed EVMs in some booths where repolling will take place. FIRs have also been lodged, an official said.         
	Voter turnout stood at 53.10 per cent in the first phase.

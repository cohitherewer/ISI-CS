          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi/Ranchi, Feb. 19: Home minister P. Chidambaram has given a clean chit to Ranchi police over last weeks lathicharge on a BJP demonstration, but expressed his sympathies for all those who were injured, including senior leader Yashwant Sinha.        
	The Rajya Sabha member, former chief minister Arjun Munda and some BJP leaders were injured in a police lathicharge on February 12 while they were holding a demonstration to demand the dissolution of the Assembly and fresh elections.         
	Refusing to pass judgement on the incident after describing the sequence of events, Chidambaram said he was unable to do so though he respects the honourable members who have complained about alleged police excess.         
	I offer my sympathies to those who have suffered injuries. I wish that such demonstrations are conducted peacefully and no cause is given for any action by the police, he told the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday. The home minister gave a detailed account of the events as received from the Jharkhand administration. Announcements were made over the public address system that orders under Section 144, CrPC had been promulgated in that area. Notwithstanding the announcement, the demonstrators broke the barricade and moved towards gate No. 2, he said.        
	On Monday, the BJP had staged a walkout in the Rajya Sabha demanding action against the police in Jharkhand for beating up a Parliamentarian. Since the state is under President Rule since January 19, it is now under the direct control of the Union homeministry.         
	In Ranchi, leader of the Opposition in the Assembly that has now been kept under suspended animation, Arjun Munda, expressed shock over Chidambarams statement.        
	The Centre, he alleged, was resorting to such tactics to hide its failures. He blamed the Centre for provoking BJP members and other political parties to gherao Raj Bhavan.         
	We gheraoed the Raj Bhavan because the Assembly still remains under suspended animation even though there is no possibility of forming an alternative government. Yet, instead of recommending dissolution of the House paving way for fresh elections, the governor ordered merciless beating up of people who were staging a democratic protest outside the Raj Bhavan, Munda said.        
	BJP president Raghubar Das alleged the Congress was spreading terror through such acts under the governor supervision. We are planning to launch nationwide campaigns over such issues. Our core committee will soon hold a meeting to finalise the action plan. In Jharkhand, we will go ahead with democratic protests, he added.

          KINSUK BASU                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 25: A Lalbazar post-mortem of yesterdays light failure at the Eden Gardens failed to throw up any clear reason today, prompting police bosses to decide on an inspection of the grounds four floodlight towers with an independent expert.        
	On Monday, senior officers and the expert will tour the ground and check the power supply system at the towers, armed with a circuit diagram for each.        
	Debasish Roy, joint commissioner of police, will talk to everyone, find the reason and fix responsibility in a detailed report, police commissioner G.M. Chakrabarti said. The deadline is seven days, but the report should come even earlier.        
	Most of the lights of Tower No. 4 went off at 5.58pm yesterday, interrupting the India-Sri Lanka ODI for 26 minutes. The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) blamed CESC for an alleged voltage fluctuation, while the PWD  responsible for overall stadium maintenance  suggested poor tower maintenance, the cricket bodys responsibility.        
	Roy had called a meeting at Lalbazar today to hear all three agencies. They will provide us with documentary evidence in support of their claims by Monday, Roy said.        
	Experts in stadium lighting said the Eden lights needed to be replaced with a system that would allow the towers to draw electricity from generators.        
	The Edens metal halide lamps are narrow-beam lights with each drawing 220 volts. Advanced, wide-beam metal halide lamps are available now and they are the best, said an expert who had overseen stadium lighting arrangements in Bangalore and Gwalior.        
	He added: Each of the four towers draws around 1,800kW now. With wide-beam lamps, the number of bulbs required would go down and the demand for power in each tower would come down to 1,000kW. This can be managed with generators.        
	The other option is installation of the Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) system. But Sadhan Mukherjee, the CABs man in charge of the tower lights, ruled this out. Well need huge UPS systems in place, housed in AC rooms. This space is not available at the Eden, he said.

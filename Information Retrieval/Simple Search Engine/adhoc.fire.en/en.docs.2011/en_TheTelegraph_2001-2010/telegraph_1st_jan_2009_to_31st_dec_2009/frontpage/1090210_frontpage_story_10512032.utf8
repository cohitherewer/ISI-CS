  Pilot action averts collision; sudden halt bursts tyre           SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                
	Mumbai, Feb. 9: An air force helicopter which was part of a presidential fleet today landed within 30 metres of an Air India aircraft at the busy Mumbai airport, the planes pilot succeeding in carrying out an emergency halt that saved the day for 150 fliers.        
	At 9 this morning, three air force Mi-17 helicopters carrying President Pratibha Patil and her entourage took off from the INS Kunjali naval air station in Colaba, headed for Santa Cruz airport.         
	Around the same time, Air India Flight IC 866, bound for New Delhi, was getting ready for take-off.         
	In the next 10 minutes, as Captain S.S. Kohli, commandeering the Airbus A-321, got the routine clearances, the presidential convoy neared the Mumbai airport.        
	They (the air force choppers) had given us their flight plan and the expected time of arrival granted to them was 9.20am. But they arrived early and the first chopper landed at 9.17am, said a source in the Mumbai air traffic control.        
	There was no news about the rest of the fleet.        
	At 9.25am, ATC cleared Kohli for take-off. As the Air India plane taxied, the pilot saw a chopper hovering over, barely 100 metres from the ground, looking to land on the same runway.        
	At the same time, he got a call from the ATC informing him about the helicopter and asking him to abort take-off. Kohli pulled the brakes and brought the plane to an emergency halt, said an Air India official.                  The Air India plane being repaired at Mumbai airport on Monday. (PTI)       
	At 9.28am, the chopper landed facing the Airbus A-321, some 30 metres away from plane. The airbus had swerved left from the impact of the sudden brakes, and one of its tyres had burst.        
	There was total panic inside the plane as the pilot initially announced an aborted take-off and later informed that we had just avoided a collision. The plane jolted to the left when it came to a sudden stop and people almost jerked out of their seats. It was scary, said Malati Sharma, who was among the 150 passengers.        
	The plane returned to the parking bay, just before the last of the three choppers carrying President Patil and Maharashtra Governor S.C. Jamir landed at 9.35am. Unaware of the incident, the President boarded an Indian Air Force plane and flew off to Gondia in Maharashtra for a scheduled function.        
	The near-miss triggered an immediate hunt for who to blame.         
	Kohli, whose quick thinking averted a possible disaster, said he had no information of the helicopter landing.         
	The chopper came in front of the aircraft. I was given a take-off clearance. The ATC is saying they did not have any contact with the chopper. The chopper just landed without taking landing clearance. We were not given any information about the chopper landing, the commander was quoted as saying on TV channels in the morning.         
	Sources in the ATC said the leader of the air force fleet had informed them about their arrival when three miles away, but did not take final landing clearance.         
	The air force has ruled out the suggestion that its pilots could be at fault. Prima facie it appears that the pilots of the entourage were meticulously following instructions given by the ATC. However, to find out the facts in greater detail, the air force has ordered an inquiry, air force spokesman Wing Commander Mahesh Upasani said in Bangalore.        
	Later in the day, fingers began to be pointed at the ATC. The incident may have been (the result of) ATCs mistake...I dont have details. An inquiry has been ordered. The ATC needs to take this issue seriously in order to avoid such incidents in the future, said Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavan.        
	The ATC had barred 15 flights from take-off or landing around the time the Presidents convoy was to land.        
	It is surprising they did not deem it fit to stop the Air India plane. It needs to be seen why. At first glance it seems that both the ATC and pilots of the Presidents convoy may have been at fault, said a Mumbai airport air safety official.

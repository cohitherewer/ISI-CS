The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Dalmatians spots of agony
                                                                                                           Dalmatians   spots of agony
          JASPER COPPING                            In pain                                        
	London, Aug. 2: With their brilliant white coats and black spots they are the most recognisable of all dog breeds, immortalised in the classic Disney film 101 Dalmatians.         
	But beneath their distinctive appearance is an underlying genetic problem that affects every Dalmatian and leaves many in agonising pain and facing an early death.        
	Now, though, a new healthy Dalmatian has been developed  free from the risk of the potentially-fatal condition.         
	Yet rather than being welcomed, the pain-free dogs have sparked controversy and even prompted the launch of a pressure group in the UK, Genuine Dalmatians, in opposition.         
	The new dog has been created by crossing Dalmatians with a different breed, the Pointer, in a deliberate bid to get rid of a defective gene which causes all pedigree Dalmatians to have high levels of uric acid in their blood  making them prone to gout, kidney stones and bladder stones.        
	Almost one in four Dalmatians will suffer poor health associated with high uric acid levels. The gene which would have combated the problem is thought to have been bred out as the dogs were bred intensively for their spots from the 1930s onwards.

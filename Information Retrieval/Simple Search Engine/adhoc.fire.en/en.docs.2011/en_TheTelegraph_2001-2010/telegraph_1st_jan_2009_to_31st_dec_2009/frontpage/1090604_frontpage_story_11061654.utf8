The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | A lesson for desher raja 
                                                                                                           A lesson for desher raja 
          PRONAB MONDAL                            Gandhi shakes hands with Debashish Das, a boy displaced by the cyclone, at a relief camp in Kathkhali. (Bishwarup Datta)                                  
	Dhamakhali, June 3: Gopalkrishna Gandhi today showed the Bengal establishment how to win hearts.        
	Not with packages but with a caring eye that caught the forgotten and with determination to reach out  even if it meant marshalling a boat small enough to glide across mud.        
	I have come here to share your pain and suffering, the governor said, sweat dripping from his brow after a kilometre-long walk along the banks of the Betni.        
	Dhamakhali is part of the cyclone zone where relief- deprived villagers had given local MLA Gopal Gayen a mud bath and pointed fingers at the chief minister less than 24 hours ago. Today, those very hands were showering petals on Gandhi and giving namaskars wherever he went.        
	Dhamakhali is on the opposite bank of the North 24-Parganas village where the chief minister was bombarded with uncomfortable questions. If Bhattacharjee visited two relief camps at Hingalganj yesterday, Gandhi went on a nearly six-hour tour today.        
	Stop the launch. Are those people repairing the embankment? Take me to them, the governor told district magistrate Vinod Kumar, pointing to villagers waving at him from the shore.         
	When another official said that the launch could get stuck in the mud, the governor replied: Okay, get me a smaller boat.        
	A mechanised boat arrived within minutes but Gandhi had difficulty boarding it without a ladder; so off went the boat back to the shore to bring a few of the villagers near the launch.        
	Leaning from the deck, the governor asked 28-year- old Netai Sardar: I am overwhelmed by your resilience. Dont give up, help will come.        
	Netai, a resident of Bermajur Kachari Ghat, just nodded. Etodin keu asheni ekbaroamaader chief minister- ekbaro dekhte elen na tar rajyer manushra kibhabe ekhane beche royechhe (nobody had come here so far even our chief minister did not come this far to see how the people of his state are living), Netai told The Telegraph later.        
	As the launch headed towards the Dhamakhali jetty, Gandhi remained on the edge of the deck and looked around.        
	A solitary concrete structure surrounded by damaged huts and a group of women and children waving at him then caught the governors eye. What is that? he asked.        
	The village is Kathkhali and that building is an office. It is being used as a shelter now, the district magistrate replied.        
	Gandhi asked for a small boat again. A phone call was made and a country boat arrived to take the governor to the riverbank.        
	Khabar pachhen to? (You are getting food, right?) he asked Minati Ghosh, 45.        
	Tears rolling down her cheeks, Minati clasped the governors folded hands and said: You are our rescuer. We have lost our homes, cattle and crops everything.         
	By the time the launch anchored at the Dhamakhali jetty, a large crowd had gathered, forcing even a couple of trucks carrying relief materials to pause. Can you show me what the trucks are carrying? What about drinking water? the governor asked one of the officials. A bottle of mineral water was brought out from one of the vehicles to show Gandhi.        
	Satisfied with what he saw, the governor turned to 45-year-old Kamala Gayen and asked: Tell me about the problems you are facing.        
	Yesterday we had no food. Today I had khichuri in a nearby relief centre but I dont know where I will get dinner, she cried.        
	Gandhi asked Kumar and the subdivisional officer of Basirhat, Apala Seth, to note down all the complaints.         
	Mohammad Ismail, 50, was impressed. The governor took the trouble of coming here to meet us, travelled by boat and visited the marooned areas, and our chief minister left only after visiting two schools, he said.        
	Desher raja hoa uchit eirokom ekjoni (the king of a state should be like him), Ismail added.        
	Irrigation minister Murtaza Hossain, who was at Najat to receive the governor in the morning, was not to be seen after Gandhi boarded the launch.

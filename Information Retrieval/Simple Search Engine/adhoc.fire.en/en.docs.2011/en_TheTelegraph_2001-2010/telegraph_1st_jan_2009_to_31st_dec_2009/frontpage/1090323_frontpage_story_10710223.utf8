          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                                      
	New Delhi, March 23: Now that the hurly-burly has been buried  or exported  a little game of blame might ensue before the IPL organisers get down to the logistics of transporting whats indubitably a spectacular circus.        
	Things will be said about government inefficiency and cussedness, about the hidebound killjoys and vested bribe-seekers that populate the corridors of power, most of all, about the uncaring boot the Establishment has given to national pride.         
	Not all of what the IPL organisers will say in their sour- grapes moment about the nature and ways of government can be quarrelled with  these are truisms that ante-date the IPL and afflict far more than just a seasonal extravaganza.        
	What they are squarely wrong about is to pitch the IPL at the fulcrum of national pride and ignominy.        
	On the evidence of its first edition last year, it must be said that the IPL is a gala like no other, the white-flannel prudes of the cricketing world notwithstanding. Messrs Lalit Modi and Co. made an extraordinary triumph of their vision, leaving the sceptics either stupefied into silence or licking what they had once loathed.        
	Even so, and this is critical to understand, the IPL is not inextricably sewn to what we understand by national  and there is no greater proof of that than the organisers swift decision to ship it across the far seas, to England or to South Africa, whichever fits best into the tight suit.        
	For all the burden they have sought to put on the Centre and state governments, the chief interest that drives the IPL/BCCI mandarins is commercial, not national. It probably bears repetition here that the BCCI, despite its nomenclature, is a private, and tightly held, club and the IPL a profitable fief whose commissar is Lalit Modi.        
	If it was indeed the national and not the commercial that dictated sentiment in that fief, should it have struck them that the lone reason the IPL fest has not found an Indian staging post this year is that there is a greater Festival of India about to unfold?        
	Elections  and the right and occasion to vote  are something the citizenry celebrates with far greater vigour and implication than anything else.         
	This is the hour that provides India a high, and exclusive, station in the comity of nations  the worlds largest democracy. Elections are the springboard from where we have leapt to where we are. Nothing could have rendered them secondary. Not least pop-corn cricket, heady and dazzling though it is.        
	Post-Mumbai, and post-Lahore, when cricket ceased to be virgin to terror, there is a heightened threat perception. IPL venues tend to be boisterous mills that challenge containment. And at venues like Eden and Mohali, or even Bangalores Chinnaswamy, where the inaugural was held, security is forever a devils undertaking.        
	The elections of April and May, the most complicated logistical exercise in the world, will increase exposure and susceptibility to surprise attacks. The forces, even minus an IPL, are stretched.         
	It could well have been that an IPL season concurrent to the elections would pass peacefully. On the contrary, it is equally likely that terror will unleash menace even without the IPL, before, after or during the elections. But thats no reason to leave the resources at hand deployed in the service of entertainment and private profiteering.        
	India, an argument goes, would have set itself apart from nations like Pakistan by demonstrating the will and ability to hold the IPL during election time. India, the same argument goes, would be reducing itself to the level of Pakistan by opting out  an insecure nation unable to cope with dangers.        
	The elections should mark, as they always have, the great and critical contrasts that exist between India and Pakistan. And the scrapping of the IPL on Indian soil probably underlines a recognition of the fact that a fine line divides bravery and foolhardiness, dubious pride and extant peril.

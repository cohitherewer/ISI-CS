  - No interviews for top job          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                            Arjun Singh                                        
	New Delhi, March 14: Arjun Singh recommended a friend for the top job on Indias largest school board after flouting standard selection procedure, just beating the announcement of the poll code last week, The Telegraph has learnt.        
	The human resource development minister recommended Pragya Srivastava, a policewoman, for the post of Central Board of Secondary Education chairperson, sources said.        
	Srivastava, a joint commissioner in charge of administration at the Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan, and two others had earlier been shortlisted by the selection committee without any interviews for potential candidates, the sources added.        
	Interviews of candidates for top government posts are not mandated by law. But the norms followed routinely, even at the HRD ministry, require a search committee to hold such interviews before drawing up a shortlist.        
	From the shortlist of three, Arjun approved Srivastavas name and forwarded it to the department of personnel and training (DoPT) in a sealed envelope, triggering questions of propriety.        
	Arjun has recommended that the appointments committee of the cabinet (ACC), headed by the Prime Minister, approve Srivastava for the post. Appointments to top posts in the government and central autonomous bodies are made by the ACC.        
	The other two shortlisted candidates were Dinesh Bist, the National Institute of Open Schooling secretary, and a joint director at the Bhopal centre of the NCERT, the sources said. Acting CBSE chairman Vineet Joshi, who managed the 2009 board examinations for Classes X and XII, was ignored.        
	Srivastavas may be the last major education appointment during Arjuns tenure.        
	IPS officer Srivastava and her husband, an IAS officer from the Madhya Pradesh cadre, have known Arjun since his days as chief minister in Bhopal in the 1980s, sources close to the minister said.        
	As recently as last month, an HRD ministry selection committee had interviewed several candidates for the post of vice-chancellor for 15 new central universities before finalising its recommendations.        
	The CBSE chairmans selection too has always involved interviews in the past, veteran education administrators confirmed.        
	Personal interaction with candidates is crucial for posts where you want to appoint someone with a vision to take an institution forward. Qualifications on paper arent enough to judge a candidates capabilities, said a retired education secretary who has been on several search-cum-selection committees.        
	In 2000, former chairman Ashok Ganguly was chosen after interviews of several shortlisted candidates.

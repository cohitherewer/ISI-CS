The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Oil strike called off
                                                                                                           Oil strike called off
          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	Guwahati, Jan. 9: Assam heaved a sigh of relief as the officials of oil companies called off their strike this evening.        
	However, the fate of the six officials, who were suspended by the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd yesterday, is yet to be decided. An ONGC official said tonight that a decision would be taken on the officials by the highest authority, maybe tomorrow.         
	Before the strike was called off this evening, chaos reigned at the few petrol pumps that were open in the city throughout the day. Long queues of vehicles snaked in front of the pumps and many motorists spent hours trying to find one where fuel would be available. Some even went hunting for fuel to refuelling stations in neighbouring Meghalaya.         
	The district administration directed most petrol pumps to ration their limited stock of petrol and diesel and asked them to give the consumers only between five and 10 litres of fuel each.        
	According to a district administration official, the panic buying by vehicle owners was one of the reasons why most refuelling stations ran dry. At least 70 per cent of the 55-odd petrol pumps in the city ran dry today.         
	He said there was no need to panic as the administration had tried to ensure that there would be no major shortage of fuel in the city.         
	He claimed there was sufficient stock at the IOC-owned depot at Betkuchi in Guwahati and they had somehow persuaded some employees at the depot to fill up 38 tankers to be sent to the city and other parts of the state.         
	He also claimed that the situation in Guwahati was much better than in many other cities of the country.         
	Sudesh Kumar Jain, the chief manager of M/s Kishore and Company, which is an Indian Oil Corporation (Assam Oil division)s refuelling station at Adabari Tinali, said a huge rush since morning had resulted in the pump running dry for sometime. But thankfully we reopened our pump in less than an hour after receiving a fresh supply of 12kl of petrol, he added.        
	There was restlessness among car owners waiting for their turn at petrol pumps. We had to take police help to calm the , he said.        
	However, people who had to wait for hours were not amused. Ranjan Chakraborty, a businessman, said his tank was nearly empty and after waiting at a petrol pump in Bhangagarh for about an hour, the staff told him they had run out of stock.        
	Another refuelling station that was kept open was Goswami Service.

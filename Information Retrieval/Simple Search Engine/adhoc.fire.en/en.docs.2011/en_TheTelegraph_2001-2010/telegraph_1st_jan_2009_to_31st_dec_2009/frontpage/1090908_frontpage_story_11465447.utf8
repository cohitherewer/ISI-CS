  - Suspicion of freak error by staffer who stood in for envoy          OUR BUREAU                      The UAE air force aircraft parked at Calcutta airport. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha                                
	Sept. 7: The nine-member crew of the United Arab Emirates air force aircraft that landed in Calcutta last evening were questioned through the day but denied they had any intention to hide that they had arms and explosives on board.        
	Nor did they provide a list of the munitions, which were in plastic bags in the plane that had landed for refuelling on its way from Abu Dhabi to Hunyang in China.        
	Air traffic control and ground control at Calcutta airport have received written orders not to allow the C-130 Hercules transport aircraft to take off till further orders, sources said. The final decision will be taken by the ministries of defence, external affairs and finance, an official said.        
	The crew members, put up in a five-star hotel off EM Bypass last night, were brought to the airport in the morning where intelligence and security officials questioned them. In the afternoon, they were taken to another five-star hotel where they were interrogated till late evening.        
	Indian Air Force intelligence officials from Eastern Command joined the Security Control Organisation in grilling the crew members  all of them UAE air force personnel led by Major Ibrahim Samsi  for hours this evening, trying to find out if their failure to declare the weapons was deliberate.        
	A source suggested it could be a freak error. The UAE ambassador to India is in Dubai because of a UAE tradition of calling back all its ambassadors world-wide during Ramazan for consultations.        
	A local employee filled out the form handed to Indias civil aviation authorities about the aircraft, and he probably did not understand the implications of a mis-declaration and its consequences. Its possible, the source said, that he did not know what the cargo was.        
	The UAE ambassador has been constantly on the phone with Delhi and with Abu Dhabi, where the UAE air force is headquartered, with the Indian ambassador too interceding with Delhi.        
	An intelligence official in Calcutta said that when customs officials entered the aircraft for a routine check yesterday, they found some objects in plastic bags.        
	When they tried to open them, the crew said the customs officials would be doing that at their own risk, he said. When the customs officials asked the crew to provide a list of the arms and ammunition, they refused, claiming the military logistics unit of the UAE did not permit them to do so.        
	The officials who questioned the crew at the airport have sent their reports to Delhi. The arms, ammunition and explosives are lying in the aircraft, which has been sealed and is being guarded by IAF personnel in front of hangar 14.        
	Officials said the entire expense of the crews stay in the city was being borne by the Indian government.        
	In Delhi, civil aviation ministry officials said the aircraft had been given permission to land on the basis of clearances from the foreign and defence ministries. The foreign ministry clearance was routine and was given easily since the UAE is a friendly country.        
	A large number of checks and clearances are required for a foreign air force aircraft to land here. Airport permission and a slot where it would be parked are among the last to be given. The ATC gives it a route to follow, an official said.        
	An airport in Sharjah, also in the UAE, once used to be the transit point for missile parts and suspected nuclear material sent from China to Pakistan, which were carried on chartered US commercial planes. The flights used to come from China to Sharjah, refuel and go to Pakistan.         
	The UAE is one of biggest arms buyers in the world, purchasing weapons far in excess of its needs. Its most publicised arms deals are with the US, the UK and France. Chinese and Russian deals are secret, and the story of defence deals with China is bound to unsettle the Pentagon, which counts the UAE as an ally.

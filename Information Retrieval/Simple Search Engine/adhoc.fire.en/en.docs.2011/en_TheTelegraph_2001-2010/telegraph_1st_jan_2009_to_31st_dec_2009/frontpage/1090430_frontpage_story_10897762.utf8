										      Bengal begins to vote today in an election where Nandigram is the key word and Mamata has usurped the Left rsquo;s language. Sujan Dutta reports                      Nandigram, seen from Tekhali Bridge two days before the first round of elections in Bengal. The bridge was the scene of many a battle since the March 14 firing in 2007. Picture by Pradip Sanyal                          
	Tekhali (Nandigram), April 29: This is a border of the mind in Bengal.         
	Public vehicles do not go across the bridge and the Talpatti Canal here because the other side is CPM turf. A tea stall that is run by a couple  and ran through the 2007 troubles  is surrounded by a panoply of flags.         
	The flags represent the CPM, Trinamul Congress, CPI, Forward Bloc, Congress, SUCI, BJP. The stall, the bridge, the Talpatti Canal and the panoply together form a marker today.        
	Tomorrow, Bengal goes to the polls. The 15th Lok Sabha elections in Bengal are being contested on an agenda set from here, though Nandigram will vote only on May 7.        
	Nandigram wants Bengal in recompense for its agonies. So far, it has only drafted a programme.        
	In our estimate, the Congress-Trinamul-SUCI alliance will get 26 of the 42 Lok Sabha seats, asserts Saiyam Qazi coolly.         
	At the peak of the troubles in 2007, a masked Qazi, cellphone in one hand and an unpleasant object in another, was an operations commander mobilising his troops against police and CPM goons  dubbed the Harmaad Bahini  for battles in the fields and greens of Nandigram. His elder brother, Qaiyam Qazi, was killed by the Bahini.        
	In Qazis estimate, the Left Fronts tally in this election will not cross 16, a plunge of 19 from their current total of 35.        
	Asura Khatun, an activist of the Bhoomi Uchhed Pratirodh Committee who is sitting with him in one of the outfits offices near Nandigram town, nods her assent. I think we should get  (we being the Trinamul-led alliance)  about 25 seats after what has happened here; nobody can vote for a government of rapists, she adds.        
	These estimates are halved 10 kilometres away at another border  the Bhangabera Bridge.        
	Makhon Das runs a tea stall there. Last election, the Congress got six and the Trinamul one, he reasons. Now they have come together. One election before that, the Trinamul had got seven, so I reckon they will get 13 seats this time, he says.        
	The Bhangabera Bridge was the venue of the March 14, 2007, firing in which at least 14 were killed. Forward Bloc leader Ashok Ghosh stirred a controversy last week, saying chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee ordered the firing. He issued a clarification later.        
	RSP leader and state minister Kshiti Goswami said recently that CPM activists in police uniform were part of the force that day and rekindled the controversy.         
	Try as it might, the CPM just cannot wish Nandigram away, much to Biman Boses exasperation.        
	No other place has ignited debate, discussion, discourse on issues in a general election in a way that Nandigram has. In Bengal, of course, but even in other states it has rekindled discussion on development and displacement.        
	But most of all in Bengal, and, for the Left Front, Nandigram means:        
	 The Left Front has to answer questions on land acquisition        
	 The Left Front is now more accountable for its treatment of minorities and the Sachar Committee report has made its position even more delicate        
	 The state governments human rights record is called to question        
	 Nandigram and Singur question the Left Front governments ability to attract investment and mitigate disputes.         
	So befuddled has this left the CPM that it is wondering if it is contesting an election to Parliament or the Assem-bly.        
	The man on the razors edge is Lakshman Seth, once the CPMs sureshot winner, Haldias strongman, and now the fourth-time Left Front nominee for the Tamluk seat who is taking on first-time contender Subhendu Adhikari of Trinamul.        
	Seth is practically confined to Haldia though Nandigram is the largest Assembly segment in his constituency. Is this a parliamentary election or an Assembly election? he wondered aloud at an assembly of Citu workers in front of the Exide factory main gate in Haldia on Wednesday morning.        
	Does Mamata Banerjee think she can become the chief minister through this election by harping on change in Bengal, a tune that Sonia Gandhi is also singing now? Do they think the people of Bengal are fools? Seth asked.        
	He devoted much of his speech to global recession. How American workers were being retrenched, how, had the Left not objected, Citibank may have taken over the State Bank of India, and Haldias workers would have been sacked. Nandigram was at the fag end of his speech.        
	There was steel in his voice when Seth said that he would win many votes from Nandigram this time but it was a pity that voting was by secret ballot. He said Trinamul was only negating whatever development the state government was proposing.        
	If only the 60,000 workers of Haldia and their families stood by him, he had nothing to fear, Seth said. It was a pity, he added, that he had not delivered political education at the pace at which we have delivered development and that was his big mistake.                    
	As a note of apology, that was much too diluted. In the months and years since the firing, Nandigram has resuscitated an Opposition in Bengal.          
	Mamata was in the wilderness before March 14, 2007, when Nandigram became a dateline. Since then, she developed an image that Singur boosted for her constituency. There is little doubt that that constituency has expanded. Nandigram, first, and Singur, afterwards, gave her a political rhetoric that she actually owes to the Left.        
	Some weeks ago, psephologist Yogendra Yadav said, in the context of Bengal, that the ruling party could lapse into playing the role of the injured Opposition. The control over the language of politics is, in a sense, their own success recoiling against them, he said.        
	Mamata today easily borrows Left jargon to berate the Left while criticising Bhattacharjees role in land acquisition policies and in human rights.        
	Nandigram has allowed her to do this, usurp the Lefts monopoly over the language of Bengals politics.        
	When Bengal votes tomorrow, it will be in the knowledge that this is the first time when the Left Front is painted wholly and fully as the Establishment, as the landgrabber, not as the land reformer.        
	For three decades, the CPM-led Left Front government in Bengal has ruled with a sense of assurance. That assurance has often been confused for steadiness or stagnation.        
	In the last two years, it has been thrown into a turbulence that 30 years of habit will find hard to accept.

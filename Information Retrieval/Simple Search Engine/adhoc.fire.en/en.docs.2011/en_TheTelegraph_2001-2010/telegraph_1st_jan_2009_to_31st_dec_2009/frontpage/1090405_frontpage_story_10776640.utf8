The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Bomber kills VIP guards in Pak heart
                                                                                                           Bomber kills VIP guards in Pak heart
                            
	Islamabad, April 4 (Agencies): A lone bomber tonight blew himself up inside a base housing paramilitary troops assigned to guard embassies and VIPs, killing eight personnel and wounding several, police said.        
	The bomber sneaked into the Frontier Corps camp after dark from a wooded area at the rear and detonated his explosives while the troops were having dinner around 7.30pm.        
	The camp is located a short distance from the bustling Jinnah Supermarket in the heart of Islamabad and is close to the United Nations office.        
	Senior police officer Bin Yamin said the bomber struck inside one of several large tents used as sleeping quarters for the 24 Frontier Corps assigned to the VIP and Diplomatic Protection Department.        
	He said the dismembered limbs of the bomber, including his legs, had been found.        
	Pakistan interior ministry chief Rehman Malik said the bomber had taken advantage of a security lapse at the camp. He dismissed reports there was more than one bomber.        
	Soon after the explosion, the troops opened fire. Police said there was no return fire but added that a suspect had been picked up.         
	Panic-stricken shoppers fled the Jinnah Supermarket, causing traffic snarls. Most shops shut within minutes. The area was cordoned off.        
	The attack on the paramilitary base comes less than a week after a militant assault on the Manawan police academy near Lahore that fuelled fears for the stability of the nuclear-armed country.        
	Malik said there had been intelligence reports in the past few weeks that terrorists had entered cities to carry out attacks but there was no information about their targets.        
	He said there was no equipment to detect suicide bombers, but security forces were training special sharpshooters to react swiftly and gun down such attackers.        
	Terrorists are using terror as a weapon against our law enforcement agencies to demoralise them, Malik said.        
	A top Obama administration envoy is due in Islamabad this week to discuss the US offer of more help  and call for more resolute action  to rout al Qaida and the Taliban entrenched along the Afghan border.

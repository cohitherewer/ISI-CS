	New Delhi, March 10: The Congress is insisting that apart from Bankura it should get another good seat in south Bengal in the interest of retaining our workers morale, a source said.        
	The party has not abandoned efforts to salvage the alliance with Trinamul but it will not entirely be on Mamata Banerjees terms, the source added.        
	Asked whether the Congress hoped to break the deadlock within the deadline Mamata had set, a senior leader told The Telegraph: Things will be clear by tomorrow.        
	The leader said the impasse was being handled at the level of K. Keshava Rao, the Congress Working Committee member looking after Bengal, and that Sonia Gandhi was unlikely to intervene if it looked as though the negotiations would collapse.        
	If it is cemented properly and the loose ends are tied, the Congress president will have a word with Mamata, the leader added.        
	Rao, who spoke to Mamata for an hour last night, told reporters that he tried hard to convince her of the need to part with a good constituency in south Bengal to keep up the workers morale. If their spirits are down, neither of us can win, I told her. In their interest, please concede just one more seat, he said.        
	Asked if the Congress was willing to let go of an alliance for the sake of just one seat, a source claimed that the view at the top was against a surrender. Besides, the party is still not sure whether any compromise is worth the effort because of the unpredictability of the durability of the alliance after the polls.        
	Delhis cost-benefit analysis showed that given the quality of the seats Trinamul has agreed to give, the prospective partnership may not be gainful to the Congress. At best we could push our tally up from six to eight. In the bargain, our workers morale will be shattered, one Congress source said.        
	A section of the Congress also feels that it should consider the post-poll scenario and take into account the possibility of having to break bread again with the Left Front.

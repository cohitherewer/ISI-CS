The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Operation Moving Day: Feel at home, Obamas
                                                                                                           Operation Moving Day: Feel at home, Obamas
          SHERYL GAY STOLBERG                            The Obamas are leaving all their furniture at their house in Chicago. That is their home base, said Katie McCormick Lelyveld, press secretary to Michelle Obama (in picture). They are bringing their clothes, pictures, creature comforts for their 10- and 7-year-olds, stuffed animals and games, those little touches that make a new house feel like home.                                  
	Washington, Jan. 20: The peaceful transfer of power that took place at the Capitol is, to many, a miracle of American democracy. But down at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, another sort of miracle has occurred: Moving Day.        
	President George W. Bush and his wife, Laura, woke up at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue on Tuesday morning, just as they have the last eight years. But by the time the new President, Barack Obama, returned from the inaugural parade with his family in the late afternoon, there would have been nary a box of theirs left to unpack.         
	Clothes would have been neatly folded in drawers, pictures resting on dresser tops and walls, stuffed animals lying on beds, as if the Obamas had always lived there.        
	The highly orchestrated quick-change operation, conducted by the 93-member White House residence staff, has no parallel in the outside world. The entire affair is over and done with in a matter of hours, without a single moving man setting foot inside the Executive Mansion.         
	Its controlled chaos, said Ann Stock, who was social secretary in the Clinton White House, on Monday. They have about four to five hours to completely unpack, put everything away in the closets, put the family pictures up and to really make the house the Obamas home by the time they come in from the parade. Its really quite an extraordinary switchover.        
	And a poignant one for the White House staff, said Gary Walters, who retired in 2007 as the White House chief usher, the official responsible for overseeing the executive residence. Walters served seven Presidents, and moving day, he said, was invariably a wistful time.        
	In the morning, the President and First Lady are saying their goodbyes to the White House and to the residence staff; theres a very emotional meeting and a goodbye, he said. Then the staff have to turn right around and become the staff of the Obamas by the afternoon. Its not an easy task.        
	True to form, the Bushes, who prided themselves on running an efficient White House, did not leave their packing until the last minute. Preparations were going on for weeks, both in the business side of the mansion, the West Wing, and in the residence.        
	On Monday, from the West Wing, boxes of documents were shipped to a storage centre in Lewisville, Texas. The National Archives, responsible for maintaining Bushs records until they go to his library in Southern Methodist University, has set up the 60,000-square-foot warehouse.        
	In the residence, the Bushes had already packed and moved many of their books, as well as out-of-season clothing and Laura Bushs collection of ball gowns, back to Texas, said Sally McDonough, the former First Ladys press secretary.         
	McDonough said the First Lady had been packing boxes herself, adding: She knows shes going to unpack them on the other end.         
	If the past is any guide, Tuesdays move would have begun about 10.45am, right after the Bushes, who would have hosted the Obamas for the traditional Inauguration Day coffee, leave for the swearing-in at the Capitol.        
	Veterans of previous White House moves say that, typically, a moving van arrives to deliver the new First Familys belongings to the waiting residence staff. Each member of the staff will have a task, assigned well in advance. If all goes well, the exercise will unfold with the precision of an orchestral piece.        
	It helps, of course, that there is little, if any, furniture to move; the White House maintains a warehouse of antiques and furnishings for Presidents to choose from.

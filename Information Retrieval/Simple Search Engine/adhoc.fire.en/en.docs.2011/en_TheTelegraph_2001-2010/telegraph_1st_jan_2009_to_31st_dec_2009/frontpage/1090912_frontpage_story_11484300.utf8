The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Defence hub hits farmland hurdle
                                                                                                           Defence hub hits farmland hurdle
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Guwahati, Sept. 11: The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)s plan to set up an establishment on the outskirts of Guwahati has run into rough weather with farmers opposing the move to acquire farmland for the project.         
	The farmers who will be affected by land acquisition today said they would not part with their fertile land under any circumstances. They will launch an agitation to protest the move by the state government to acquire nearly 2,200 bighas under the North Guwahati and Kamalpur revenue circles in Kamrup district.         
	The peasants will stage a sit-in on September 15 from 11am to 3pm in front of the office of North Guwahati revenue circle to protest the proposed land acquisition.         
	They have also formed a committee called Greater Borchandra, Borchandra Grant Bamunigaon, Jalah, Bolaibil and Changsari Agricultural Land Protection Committee.         
	We have petitioned Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi, defence minister A.K. Antony, the MLA of Jalukbari Assembly constituency, Himanta Biswa Sarma, among others, seeking their intervention to stop any move to acquire farmland, president of the committee, T. Ali, said.         
	But so far no action has been taken to save the agricultural land of the poor farmers, Ali said.         
	When our problems were not addressed even after repeated demands, we were left with no option but to agitate. We will launch our democratic agitation through the sit-in on September 15 and if the need arises, our movement will be intensified, he said.         
	According to the committee, around 10,000 families will be affected by the land acquisition for the DRDO project and about 90 per cent of them are farmers.         
	Since farmers have made it clear that they were not willing to part with fertile land, we want that less valuable arid land should be acquired for the purpose. We will resist tooth and nail any attempt to forcibly acquire our land, joint secretary of the committee Prabodh Lekharu said.         
	Nearly 50,000 residents, likely to be affected by the DRDO project, are spending sleepless nights over the proposed land acquisition, he added.         
	We have formed the committee to send the message that villagers are united and will strongly oppose any move to acquire land without our consent, he added.         
	As the farmers have refused to budge from their stand, it is feared that the situation may snowball into a Singur and Nandigram.         
	Kamrup deputy commissioner Ramesh Chand Jain said there will be no displacement of people for the DRDO project, as the land proposed to be acquired are either forest land or farmland.         
	I see no reason for them to protest as the affected persons will be adequately compensated by the government. Moreover, this project needs special consideration since it is important for the security of the country, Jain said.

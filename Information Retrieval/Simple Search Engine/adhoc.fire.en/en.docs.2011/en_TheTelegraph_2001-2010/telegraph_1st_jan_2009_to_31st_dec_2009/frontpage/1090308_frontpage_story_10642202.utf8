The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Obama to lift stem cell curbs
                                                                                                           Obama to lift stem cell curbs
          DAVID STOUT AND GARDINER HARRIS                            Obama: Keeping a pledge                                  
	Washington, March 7: President Obama will announce on Monday that he is reversing Bush administration limits on federal financing for embryonic stem cell research as part of a pledge to separate science and politics, White House officials said yesterday.        
	As a presidential candidate, Obama spoke out in favour of stem cell research, so his intention to undo the curbs put in place by President George W. Bush is not surprising.         
	But the decision is nonetheless of great interest, involving a long-controversial intersection of science and personal moral beliefs.        
	The officials said that advocates of unfettered stem cell research, as well as about 30 Democratic and Republican lawmakers who support it, had been invited to a White House ceremony, when Obama is expected to make an announcement.

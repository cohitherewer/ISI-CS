          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                            Jugal Pals wife Shobha pays her respects to Saryu Das in Rabda village while on the campaign trail. Picture by Prashant Mitra                                  
	Rabda (Vishrampur), Dec. 15: He is the one who instigated the youths of Palamau to take up arms against feudal landlords in the mid-1980s, and now, he is the man who is motivating them to shun violence and join mainstream politics.        
	Meet the grand old man of Palamau, centenarian Saryu Das. This former British Indian Army jawan who deserted the force in 1938 to protest against poor treatment of native soldiers, took shelter in Dhanbad collieries soon after.        
	He worked as a manual labourer to make ends meet. Even after India became independent, Das avoided returning home for decades, fearing arrest. But all the while in colliery bustees, he waged a war against moneylenders. Though he never met Shibu Sorens father, he was impressed by the latters movement against moneylenders. Sorens father was killed by loan sharks, which in turn goaded his son into openly revolting against the existing social order.        
	In 1983, Das decided to settle down at his in-laws ancestral home in Rabda. Moved by the plight of Dalits and tribals, and their ill treatment by upper caste landlords, Das mobilised the youth to hit back. He got his nephew Jugal Pal and others like Vijay Kanu, Kameshwar Baitha, Madhu Singh, Satish Kumar and Jagdeo Sharma to vow to end social discrimination through armed struggle.        
	The landlords first retaliated with police cases and then formed the Sunlight Sena to teach the youths a lesson. Mass massacres became routine.         
	The police repeatedly raided the homes of these youths and even arrested some of them. Das too was arrested, but was released after several months due to lack of evidence.        
	The boys advised me not to participate in their operations because of my old age. They fled into the forests and began mobilising the oppressed from there. I am not educated, but I am not ready to accept that any sane society can exploit the poor to this extent. Our children were even discouraged from going to school, Das said.        
	Later, Madhu Singh went on to become a minister in the governments led by Babulal Marandi and Arjun Munda. This time, he is trying his luck from Panki Assembly constituency. Kameshwar Baitha is a Lok Sabha member. A former central committee member of CPI(Maoist), Jugal Pal is contesting the Vishrampur Assembly seat. Satish Kumar is in the fray in Daltonganj.        
	I sent word to my boys and ordered them to return home. I told them if they did not come home soon, their sisters and daughters would be in trouble again. They have been left to fend for themselves in the absence of male members or strong guardians, said Das, speaking exclusively to The Telegraph.        
	He admitted that social discrimination was a lot less than before. Now, those belonging to upper castes gave due respect to Dalit elders. But, he added that uplift of the downtrodden could not take place unless they returned to the mainstream and compelled the official machinery to do the needful.        
	The need to fight against feudal forces is over. Now we need to wage a non-violent war against the official machinery. I dont want to comment on why Pal, Kumar and Baitha joined JMM. But, let me clarify that the real ultra-Left ideologues are not opposed to elections and other institutions of democracy. Like any other organisation, brokers and confused persons have made an impact on ultra-Left outfits as well, he signed off.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Itanagar, Oct. 7: The Congress is looking to the heavens for divine intervention as overcast skies have again threatened to pour cold water on the hopes of party workers and the leaders waiting eagerly for Sonia Gandhis daylong campaign in poll-bound Arunachal Pradesh tomorrow.         
	Amid a thick security blanket the Congress president is scheduled to address rallies at Daporijo and Aalo tomorrow, after inclement weather scuttled son Rahuls scheduled trip here yesterday.         
	The Congress is contesting all 60 seats for the October 13 Assembly elections.        
	Sonia will first address a rally at Daporijo, the headquarters of Upper Subansiri district, and then fly to Aalo in West Siang, the PCC confirmed this evening.         
	At Daporijo, she will campaign for Congress candidate and president of the state womens Congress unit, Yari Dulom. Sonia will then seek votes for the partys candidates for Aalo East and Aalo West Jarkar Gamlin and Gadam Ete. Party sources said Sonia would arrive at the Mohanbari airport in Dibrugarh on a chartered plane. From there, she will take a chopper to Daporijo.        
	Union minister of state for rural development Agatha Sangma today vowed to give the Congress a tough fight and she ruled out the possibility of the NCP merging with the Congress.

	London, Feb. 28: U2 played a rooftop concert in the centre of London, atop a balcony at BBC Broadcasting House.         
	While certain commentators have deplored the commercial imperatives of an enterprise dubbed the Bono Broadcasting Corporation, there were few complaints from the throng in the street and at the windows of surrounding buildings, treated to a free concert from the biggest band in the world.         
	The Beatles started it all with their rooftop gig at Apple in 1969, famously halted by over zealous London constabulary.         
	If, indeed, Bono was there at all. A roar went up as a figure made regal wave from the balcony, although there was some debate about what this represented.         
	Which ones which?asked a woman next to me. It was, to be honest, hard to tell what was going on from seven stories down but when the guitar, drums and bass kicked up and a raw, high voice started wailing about sexy boots disbelief was suspended.         
	U2 played four songs, the growing crowd on the street raising their voices to sing lustily along to old favourites Beautiful Day and Vertigo.

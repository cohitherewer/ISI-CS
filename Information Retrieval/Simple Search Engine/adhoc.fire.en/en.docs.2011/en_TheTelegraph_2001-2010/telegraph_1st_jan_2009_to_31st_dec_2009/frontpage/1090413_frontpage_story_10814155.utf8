The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | JMM expels Durga
                                                                                                           JMM expels Durga
          AMIT GUPTA                                              
	Ranchi, April 12: The JMM today expelled its general secretary and Shibu Sorens eldest son Durga on charges of indiscipline. Soren junior will have to stay away from party matters for the next five years.        
	The move is being seen as a corrective step. Ever since Durga (in picture) filed his nomination from the Godda parliamentary seat, allegedly without the consent of his father and senior party leaders, the JMMs ties with the Congress  which has fielded Furkan Ansari  ran into rough weather.         
	Several senior JMM leaders had voiced their protests against Durgas move, saying it would upset the partys poll equations and strain ties with the Congress. However, in the absence of Shibu Soren, under treatment in Delhi, they had no choice but to wait.        
	Talking to The Telegraph from Jamshedpur, JMMs central committee vice-president Champai Soren said: The partys core committee (comprising Soren senior and Rajmahal MP Hemlal Murmu among others) had decided to expel Durga for five years. He has been expelled after we received a consent from Guruji.        
	With the JMM showing him the door, Durga will be reduced to an independent candidate.

	Feb. 7: Two men were killed in the Dooars today as Gorkha Janmukti Morcha supporters clashed with Adivasis and other anti-Gorkhaland protesters across the region and Siliguris outskirts.        
	Rival groups ransacked homes and torched shops and vehicles as violence flared during a 24-hour shutdown called by the Morcha to press for permission to hold rallies in the Dooars and Terai.        
	Cassette shop owner Sunil Mandal, 48, was beaten to death during a clash at Banarhat in Jalpaiguri subdivision, about 75km from Siliguri.         
	In Ethelbari, Alipurduar subdivision, police stumbled on two unconscious men  Akbar Lama, 35, and Solo Kanchha Dorji, 50. Lama died on the way to hospital.        
	In Calcutta, home secretary Ardhendu Sen said clashes took place in Birpara, Banarhat, Bhaktinagar and Sukna but claimed that things were under control by afternoon.        
	Morcha supporters had tried to loot and damage shops and markets; in retaliation, the Adivasis torched some Morcha supporters homes. There have been around 100 arrests, he said.         
	In Darjeeling, Morcha general secretary Roshan Giri blamed the violence on the CPM. We demand the chief ministers resignation. The CPM is trying to mislead the Adivasis, he said. We will hold black-flag demonstrations tomorrow.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Dachshund short legs explained
                                                                                                           Dachshund short legs explained
                                Dachshund: Stubby                            
	Chicago, July 17 (Reuters): An extra gene may explain why dachshunds, corgis and basset hounds have short, stubby legs, US researchers said yesterday.        
	They said while most dogs have only one copy of a growth-related gene, nearly 20 different breeds of short-legged dogs have a second, slightly altered copy of the gene called fibroblast growth factor 4 or FGF4.        
	This so-called retrogene appears to be copy of a wolf gene that got spliced back into the dog genome some time after modern dog breeds diverged from wolves. We were surprised to find that just one retrogene inserted at one point during the evolution of a species could yield such a dramatic physical trait, Heidi Parker of the National Human Genome Research Institute.        
	Parker and colleagues think this gene may turn on growth mechanisms at the wrong time during foetal development, stunting the growth of long bones in the leg and making them curvy.        
	The trait affects only the legs, unlike the small-all-over effect seen in miniature or toy breeds, such as poodles, they said. Parker said retrogenes may play a more important role in evolution.        
	And she thinks researchers should start looking in humans to see if the FGF4 gene plays a role in a form of dwarfism called hypochondroplasia, which represents about one-third of the unexplained cases of dwarfism in humans.

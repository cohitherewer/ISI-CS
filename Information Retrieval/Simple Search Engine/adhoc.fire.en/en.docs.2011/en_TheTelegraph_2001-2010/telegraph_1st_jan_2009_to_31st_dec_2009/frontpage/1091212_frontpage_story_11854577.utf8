  - Unsure about numbers, party begins post-poll ally search, sends feelers to JMM        OUR BUREAU                                    
	Jamshedpur/Ranchi, Dec. 11: The Congress has begun sounding out the JMM unofficially for a post-poll tie-up in case the numbers dont add up to form a government in Jharkhand.        
	Though some senior Congressmen, including the likes of Union minister and Ranchi MP Subodh Kant Sahay, believe that the Congress-JVM combine was on way to getting an absolute majority after the third phase of elections, an internal assessment of the party is said to have indicated otherwise.        
	With the possibility of a hung Assembly gaining ground, Congress leaders were believed to have started holding secret parleys with the JMM to lay the foundation for a possible post-poll partnership.        
	Congress in-charge K. Keshav Rao did not spell out the partys immediate plans, but indicated that doors were open for negotiations if the numbers werent adequate. If the need arises, the alliances may go for post-poll understanding with some like-minded parties to form a government, he said in Ranchi today.        
	JVM president and former chief minister Babulal Marandi also maintains that the alliance would be able to reach the magic figure of 41 by the time the last two phases of voting are over.         
	But the Congress is beginning to get worried.         
	We might fall short of numbers. So it is necessary to begin the homework with the JMM now. We need numbers and the JMM fits into our scheme of things. We have worked together earlier too, a senior Congress leader said on condition of anonymity.        
	When asked about the JMM, Sahay wouldnt say more than Rao. We wont make our position official till the fifth and final phase ends on December 18. The party will make an assessment of the situation and take further steps towards government formation, the Union minister said.        
	The Congresss assessment is that in its stronghold of Santhal Pargana, the JMM wouldnt do as badly as was being projected earlier. It is also likely gain some seats in Kolhan, which goes to polls tomorrow.                     
	Based on our internal assessment, the JMM cannot be taken for granted. Its an old regional political outfit, reasoned a local Congress functionary.

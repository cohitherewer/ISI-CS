          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                            Singh, (below) Deora                                            
	New Delhi, Jan. 9: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was so upset with his colleagues that a meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs, which was to follow a cabinet sitting, was called off.        
	Singhs exasperation rubbed off on other ministers who wondered why Murli Deora, the petroleum and natural gas minister, and T.R. Baalu, the road transport, highways and shipping minister, took their jobs so casually.        
	This morning, as the ministers took their seats, it almost seemed as though India were running out of petrol, LPG and essential commodities, fuelled by hartals by oil PSUs and truckers. The cabinets agenda was brief but Singh departed from it to ask Deora and Baalu to brief members about the situation.        
	Baalu was not around  he was in hometown Chennai. He was sent a message to return to Delhi immediately.        
	Deora was present but, according to sources, when Singh asked him for a report on the oil companies strike, he turned to his secretary. The bureaucrat made a staccato delivery from a two-page note that, a source said, was not exactly enlightening.        
	P. Chidambaram filled in some details to put a perspective on the oil strike. Sources said he spoke of the huge salaries the executives were earning, starting with Rs 1 lakh-plus. The ministers, including those who were pro-worker, were so aghast they immediately rooted for tough action.        
	Deora was gently told he ought to be more serious about his work.

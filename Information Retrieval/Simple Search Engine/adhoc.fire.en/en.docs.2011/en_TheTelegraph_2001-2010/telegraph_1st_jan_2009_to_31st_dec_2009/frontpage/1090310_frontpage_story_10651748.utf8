The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | IPL onus back on wary states
                                                                                                           IPL onus back on wary states
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Mumbai/New Delhi, March 9: The Centre has again left it to states to decide whether they can manage security for the Indian Premier League whose revised schedule has been sent to the home ministry for clearance.         
	Besides the eight home cities of the franchisees, the recast schedule is learnt to have seven neutral venues  Vadodara, Dharamsala, Nagpur, Cuttack, Ahmedabad, Visakhapatnam and Indore.         
	The revised schedule was drawn up following home minister P. Chidambarams assertion last week that he would not like to over-stretch the paramilitary forces, who also have poll duty. The home ministry has passed on the new dates to the states for vetting. Once we get the states approval, the new schedule will be announced, maybe by tomorrow or the day after, said an IPL official.        
	The Centre is shifting the onus to the states following intelligence inputs about a high threat perception.         
	Tamil Nadu has asked for two companies of the Rapid Action Force; Bengal, Delhi and Karnataka want four companies of central paramilitary forces, while Maharashtra and Chandigarh have demanded five. One company has around 125 personnel.        
	Calcutta police confirmed receiving the new dates, but did not say if these were acceptable. The police had objected to match dates falling within 48 hours of election days: Howrah and Calcutta vote on May 7 and 13, respectively.        
	We have received the dates but nothing has been finalised. We have to first discuss the proposal with the government, said police commissioner G.M. Chakrabarti.        
	Maharashtra police did not appear too happy. We have security inputs advising against hosting IPL matches in April. Maharashtras entire three-phase polling is in April. Even with the five battalions of paramilitary forces we have been assured, this looks like a tough call, said an officer.

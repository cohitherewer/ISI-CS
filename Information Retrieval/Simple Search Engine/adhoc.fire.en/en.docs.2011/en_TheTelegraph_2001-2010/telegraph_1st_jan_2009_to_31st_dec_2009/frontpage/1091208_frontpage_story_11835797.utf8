	Dec. 7: Pakistani American David Headleys links to the Mumbai attacks and the Lashkar-e-Toiba received an official US stamp today with federal prosecutors formally charging him with surveillance of targets ahead of 26/11.        
	Headley, 49, was charged in a 12-count criminal information with six counts of conspiracy, including plotting to murder and maim Indians and Americans in Mumbai and providing material help to the Pakistan-based Lashkar. (See chart)        
	Charges were also announced against a retired Pakistan Army major, Abdur Rehman Hashim Syed, for allegedly taking part in a plot to attack a Danish newspaper that had published cartoons of the Prophet in 2005.        
	Headley too had been charged with this offence in October along with Chicago businessman Tahawwur Hussain Rana, 48, after they were arrested by the FBI in Chicago.        
	Todays new charges point to Headleys Pakistan connection by accusing him of attending a Lashkar training camp in that country  between February and August 2002, and between August and December 2003  and by linking him to the retired Pakistani major.        
	Syed is said to have played the central role in communicating with Headley and facilitating contacts with co-conspirators in Pakistan, including Lashkar member and Headleys alleged handler, Ilyas Kashmiri.        
	Headley has been in federal custody without bond since his arrest. No date has been set yet for his arraignment in the district court in Chicago.        
	For the first time, US authorities revealed that Headley was co-operating. He could provide other leads on the Mumbai attacks  which killed 166 people including six Americans  since the case remains active and ongoing, US attorney Patrick Fitzgerald said.        
	The developments come at a time an FBI team is in India to share and exchange information. Disappointed officials in Delhi, however, said the Indians gave more information than they received.        
	This is the fulfilment of the Presidents (Obamas) commitment to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh during his recent visit to co-operate closely in the case, a US embassy spokesperson said, adding the team would next travel to Islamabad.        
	The Chicago charges mention an Individual A known to Headley  its not clear if he is Rana. After being tasked in late 2005 with gathering surveillance in Mumbai, Headley travelled to Chicago in June 2006 and advised Individual A of his assignment.        
	He obtained As approval to open an office of First World Immigration Services  run by Rana in New York, Chicago and Toronto  in Mumbai in 2006 as cover for his activities, the charges said.        
	Headley changed his name from Daood Gilani in 2006 and posed as a Jew in India. He made five trips to Mumbai Rana accompanied him on one, Indian police say  taking video footage of targets, including the Taj and Oberoi-Trident hotels, Leopold Caf, Nariman House and the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus.        
	Headley travelled to Mumbai in September 2006, February and September 2007, and April and July 2008. After each trip, he returned to Pakistan, met other co-conspirators and provided them with photographs, videos and oral descriptions of the locations, the charges say.

          MANUEL ROIG-FRANZIA                       Kennedy rsquo;s Portuguese water dog named Cappy. (AP)                          
	Washington, April 12: Who let the dog out?         
	Thats the Washington mystery du jour.        
	The identity of the first puppy  the one that the Washington press corps has been yelping about for months, the one President Barack Obama has seemed to delight in dropping hints about  leaked out yesterday.         
	This despite White House efforts to delay the news until the big debut planned for Tuesday afternoon.        
	The little guy is a six-month-old Portuguese water dog given to the Obama girls as a gift by that Portuguese water dog-lovin senator himself, Edward M. Kennedy.         
	The girls named it Bo. Malia and Sasha chose the name, because their cousins have a cat named Bo and because First Lady Michelle Obamas father was nicknamed Diddley, a source said. (Get it? Bo... Diddley, the rock and roll legend?)         
	Bo is a handsome little guy. Well suited for formal occasions at the White House, hes got tuxedo-black fur, with a white chest, white paws and a rakish white goatee.         
	A website called www.firstdogcharlie.com published a picture of a Portuguese water dog yesterday morning. The dog, it said, was originally named Charlie.         
	For an Obama team that ran a famously tight-knit press operation during last years presidential election campaign, it was a sign of how tough it can be to keep a leash on information in Washington.         
	Sure, reporters nipped at the story. There were hints that the puppy was a gift. There were reports that the Kennedys were involved  but the Senators press people professed no knowledge.         
	But yesterday morning, The FirstDogCharlie site included a photograph of a Portuguese water dog that looked exactly like the dog in a White House photograph  right down to the multicoloured lei.         
	The White House dismissed the website picture as bogus.         
	Still, theres lots of stuff that didnt leak out, including a secret get-acquainted session with the family at the White House a few weeks ago. The visit, known around the White House as The Meeting, was a surprise for the girls.         
	Bo charmed the first family, a source who was there said. He sat when the girls sat, stood when the girls stood. He made no toileting errors and did not gnaw on the furniture.         
	Bo has, after all, been receiving lessons in good behaviour from the Kennedys dog trainers. These lessons have been taking place at a secret, undisclosed location outside Washington.         
	Bo, though he was raised elsewhere, already has a keen sense of whos in charge inside the Beltway. When the President walked across the room during the visit, Bo followed obediently.

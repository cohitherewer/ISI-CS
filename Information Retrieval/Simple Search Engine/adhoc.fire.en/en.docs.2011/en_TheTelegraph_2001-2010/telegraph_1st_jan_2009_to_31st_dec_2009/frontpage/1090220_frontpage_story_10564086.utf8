  - Azhar joins congress, leaves contest decision to party           OUR BUREAU                                            
	New Delhi/Hyderabad, Feb. 19: From a nave, God-fearing boy he had turned an Armani-clad celebrity with an actress on his arm, and from Indias then most-successful captain to a disgraced player banned for match-fixing. But in his latest makeover, Mohammed Azharuddin has at last done the expected.        
	The 46-year-old today joined the Congress, entering a field where the ability to reinvent oneself is a professional skill, amid speculation he could be nominated in the Lok Sabha polls.        
	I am happy to be here. The Congress has done so much for the country, Azhar told reporters at the party headquarters in Delhi after a meeting with Sonia Gandhi.        
	Asked if he would be contesting the upcoming elections, he ducked the question like he would have to a Malcolm Marshall bouncer.        
	I am a player and not the captain now, so I cannot decide. If the party feels I am good enough to contest, I will abide by its decision.        
	Andhra Pradesh Congress leaders want him to take on the BJP in Malkajgiri in Secunderabad, now represented by Anjan Kumar Yadav of the Congress.        
	BJP spokesman Shahnawaz Hussain took a dig, saying: All the fixers in the nation are either joining the Congress or the Samajwadi Party.        
	Congress leader M. Veerappa Moily, who was present at the media briefing along with Andhra Congress chief D. Srinivas, said there was no case against Azhar in any court.        
	Only, he has filed a case against the BCCI (the national cricket board that banned him in 2000), Moily said. The verdict on Azhars appeal against the ban is still awaited.        
	Sometimes you have to keep your eyes and ears closed, Azhar said about the match-fixing charges. There will always be people criticising you.        
	The political debut didnt hold the surprise of his appointment as India captain in 1990, when then board strongman Raj Singh Dungarpur is said to have tapped him with an unforgettable: Kya miyan, captain banoge?        
	Sources said Azhar had approached the Congress high command through former Ranji player Kiran Kumar Reddy, now Congress chief whip in the Andhra Assembly. Azhar told me he was now ready for a different role, Reddy said.        
	The former cricketer then met Moily in Hyderabad last month. I have known Moily and Srinivas for the past 25 years, he said.        
	I would like to thank Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and the whole Congress fraternity, Azhar said. I have been a fan and supporter of Rajiv Gandhi. When I made my world record (centuries in first three Tests) in 1985, the first call I received was (then Prime Minister) Rajiv Gandhis. I can never forget that day.        
	Muslim supporters of the Congress and cricket fans held a march near Charminar in Hyderabad, and a motorcycle rally in the Old City, welcoming Azzubhais entry into politics. Azhars family distributed sweets at their Jubilee Hills home.        
	They said Azhars actress wife Sangeeta Bijlani, whom he had married after divorcing his first wife, wanted to accompany him to Delhi but stayed back in Mumbai, the couples current home, on his advice.        
	Before leaving for Delhi, the ex-skipper visited the Ameenpur Dargah near Kadapa in Andhra and also the Ajmer Sharif shrine in Rajasthan. Last week, he had taken part in the Friday prayers at Hyderabads Mecca Masjid.        
	The man whose career was sawn off at 99 Tests today wore his lucky watch, a Rolex. Azhar is known to have a weakness for expensive watches and has a vast collection of Tissots, Rolexes, Rados and TAG Heuers.        
	After his ban, Azhar had become a director in Novopan Ltd, a GVK company. He also set up an event management company with Sangeeta, which did not succeed, and opened a hotel in Bangalore, Bawarchi. He later gave all of them up and opened a restaurant, Tabla, and a gym in Banjara Hills.        
	In 2004, he was projected as a possible campaigner for the Telugu Desam Party but had cold feet at the last minute.        
	After a long time, I have come before a large gathering, he said today. I consider myself a child of destiny and it is because of destiny that I am before you.        
	BJP hunt        
	The BJP has begun scouting for celebrities to match the Congresss glamour quotient. Sources said the party was working on actor Anil Kapoor to offset the Azhar effect, and had offered him a seat of his choice anywhere in the country.        
	The BJP plans to field Rajya Sabha member Hema Malini from Delhi after her husband, Dharmendra, expressed his reluctance to contest this time.

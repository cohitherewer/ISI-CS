The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Reading smoke signals, Left runs to net Naveen
                                                                                                           Reading smoke signals, Left runs to net Naveen
          JAYANTH JACOB                                        Back among friends: (From top) Patnaik, Yechury, Karat, Bhattacharjee                          
	New Delhi, March 8: The Left has swung into discussions for a pre-poll alliance with Naveen Patnaik, capping months of manoeuvres marked by personal rapport that drew on smoking habits and acquaintances which went a long way back.        
	Less than 24 hours after the Orissa chief minister parted ways with the BJP, CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury landed in Bhubaneswar to pick up in public the thread of what had so far been private talks.        
	We had a very good discussion. The talks were preliminary and held on seat-sharing. We will have further talks on a pre-poll alliance, Yechury told reporters after meeting Naveen.        
	The most important thing is that they (the BJD) broke away from the BJP. We will be working together now, Yechury told The Telegraph later.        
	Asked whether Naveens Biju Janata Dal would join the third front the Left parties are trying to form, the CPM leader said: Forming the third front is a national issue. We today discussed only about a pre-poll alliance in Orissa.        
	Naveen concurred: It centred around seat-sharing in Orissa. We will share seats with the Left parties.        
	Sources said the discussions revolved around the possibility of setting aside one Lok Sabha seat and 22 Assembly seats for the Left in Orissa. Of the 21 seats from the state in the outgoing Lok Sabha, 18 are held by the erstwhile alliance of the BJD (11) and the BJP (7).        
	More than the lone seat, if the pre-poll alliance comes through, the nebulous third front can assume a more concrete shape than many had thought so far.        
	The Left is in talks with Jayalalithaa, Deve Gowda, N. Chandrababu Naidu and Telengana spearhead K. Chandrasekhar Rao. Such a front is still not expected to have enough numbers to form a government of its own but if Naveen goes on board, the groups bargaining power could take on a potent edge.        
	The BJP was taken by surprise by Naveens unilateral withdrawal despite rising tension between the partners since the attacks on Christians in Orissa, but the CPM was more or less certain on Friday itself that the plug was about to be pulled.        
	One day before BJP emissary Chandan Mitra reached Bhubaneswar in a desperate bid to salvage the alliance, Yechury was in the Orissa capital working on Naveen.         
	The Left choice was apt: Yechury was by the side of the late Harkishen Singh Surjeet during the formative days of the United Front in which Naveens father Biju Patnaik played a key part.        
	Yechury reported to the CPM leadership that a break was imminent  the culmination of events in which the Left also had some role on the sidelines.        
	Among the Left leaders who share a good rapport with Naveen is Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. Some CPM leaders suggested  only half in jest  that smoking breaks at chief ministers meetings in Delhi (both Naveen and Bhattacharjee love to light up) laid the foundation for the below-the-radar talks that paved the way to todays discussions with Yechury.        
	Brinda Karat, another politburo member, also knows the Doon-educated Naveen well, their association dating back to the days before either joined politics.        
	The anti-Christian violence in the state last year was the time when the CPM sensed an opportunity to wean away the suave and secular Naveen, who many felt was a misfit in an alliance with a partner which turned a blind eye to the atrocities on minorities.        
	Many a Left activist went on fact-finding missions to the affected areas, and Left leaders, including CPM general secretary Prakash Karat, addressed seminars on the issue. But all spared Naveen and focused on suggesting that his party should walk out on the BJP. The Left also exploited the growing feeling within the BJD that the BJP was getting prominence disproportionate to its presence in the state.        
	The circumstances that followed the Lefts withdrawal of support to the UPA helped increase the frequency of informal contacts between the CPM and the BJD. However, at the beginning, we were only looking for the BJDs support at the Centre after the elections. Then, gradually we realised the growing mismatch within the alliance, a CPM leader said.        
	Last night, Naveen spoke to CPM leaders in Delhi. He wanted a senior Left leader to visit the Orissa capital. It was then decided to send Yechury again to Bhubaneswar.        
	We are happy to hear the news of the BJD breaking off from the BJP and the NDA. Politburo member Sitaram Yechury is scheduled to meet Naveen Patnaik and other leaders, Prakash Karat said in Delhi in the afternoon.        
	The Left, the NCP and the JMM have offered support to Naveen who faces a floor test on Wednesday.                    WITH INPUTS FROM SUBRAT DAS IN BHUBANESWAR

	Thiruvananthapuram, Sept. 30: At least 38 people were feared drowned today when a boat carrying tourists capsized in a lake in a Kerala wildlife sanctuary, apparently after all of them moved to one side to see an elephant herd.        
	Three of the victims were identified as Pradip Kumar, K.K. Deepak and Anup Pandey from Calcutta. Other details of the three were not available till late tonight.         
	Sources said most of the tourists were from Delhi, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. Unconfirmed reports said a male foreigner, whose nationality was not immediately known, was also among the victims.        
	Speedboats rescued 13 tourists who clutched at tree stumps and other flotsam, but by nightfall the body count had risen to 38, including 14 women and six children.        
	The accident in the Periyar Lake in Thekkady Wild Life Sanctuary, some 195km from Kochi, is the worst tourism tragedy in Kerala, whose idyllic backwaters have made it the biggest tourist attraction in India after Rajasthan.        
	Eyewitnesses said the Kerala Tourism Development Corporation (KTDC) boat, which had set off around 4 this afternoon, tilted a little over an hour later after the tourists moved to one side for a better look at a herd of elephants on the banks.        
	The boat capsized in one of the deepest points in the lake where the depth of the water measures around 120ft. Sources said the boat, Jalakanyaka, was only a month old and in good condition.        
	According to the sources, the boat had 76 people on board, though unconfirmed reports put the number at 80, five more than the boats capacity.        
	KTDC sources, however, insisted the boat had 65 people on board, but the corporation is under glare because there were not enough life jackets and life belts.        
	I dont know how I managed to escape from the capsized boat, said a tourist from Tamil Nadu who swam to safety.        
	Pankaj Maurya, cruising in another boat around the time of the accident, said they threw air-filled tubes and rope and whatever they could place their hands on.        
	On the half-submerged boat, a couple wailed as they searched frantically for their one-year-old child.        
	Police and local residents were engaged in rescue operations late into the night, but darkness and absence of medical personnel hampered the efforts. A unit of the Indian Navy was on its way to the accident spot.        
	Two years ago, 18 schoolchildren and four teachers died when a boat carrying 37 students capsized in the Periyar river near Thattekadu Bird Sanctuary.        
	The Kerala government has set up an emergency control room whose number is 0471-2333198. The tourism department has also arranged help desks on the following numbers: 0486-9222620/9222111 and 94460 52361, officials said.

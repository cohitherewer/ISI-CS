The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | City toughest business nut
                                                                                                           City toughest business nut
          OUR BUREAU                                              
	June 30: Calcutta has been ranked the toughest place to do business in a survey of 17 cities by the World Bank.        
	Some state government officials blamed a perception factor, like the exit of the Nano. Perception is as important as delivery on the ground. While there is a lot to improve, the report reflects more what people think of us than the reality is, Subrata Gupta, managing director of West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC), said.        
	Gupta felt that the Nanos departure had worsened the perception about the state.        
	But an analyst associated with the survey said local officials were also kept in the picture. The team had several rounds of interactions with local officials. The preliminary data were sent to the local officials for review and comments on a confidential basis, Jana Malinska, the investment policy specialist with the project, said in an email response to a questionnaire from The Telegraph.         
	The data were collected with the help of 15 private sector professionals representing big law, accounting and trading firms in Calcutta, she added. A dozen of local officials from different departments took part in the project-launching meetings. We invited them to fill out the surveys along with our private sector contributors.        
	Calcutta is ranking last in the report but the active participation of the local officials in our study could be a sign that improvements could be happening, Malinska said.        
	The key areas of concern, such as registering property and obtaining building clearance, had struck deep root much before the Nano was conceived. Left untreated, such festering ailments could have bubbled back to the surface because of the churning over the past few years and the consequent administrative inertia, an official of an industry chamber said in Delhi.        
	It is good feedback. It is a wake-up call for the state administration to take corrective measures, said another city-based investor, Mahendra K. Jalan.        
	The seven parameters of the survey were ease of starting business, dealing with construction permits, registering property, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and closing a business. It did not take into account macroeconomic conditions, infrastructure, workforce skills or security parameters that are vulnerable to perceptions.        
	Construction permit and property registration, two areas where Calcutta languishes at the bottom, fall in the domain of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.        
	Asked, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya said: The World Bank study was based on a survey done a few years back. But I will not deny that the problems here are far more severe than in other places. But we have started the improvement process. We have reduced the time taken for mutations and plan to reduce it even more.        
	The mayor said building sanction took more time because we have to follow the government protocol and CMC does not have a free hand there.         
	However, a state industry department official admitted that conversion of land for industry and mutation took a very long time.        
	A lawyer felt that the low rank on enforcing contracts  a legal issue  had to do more with perception than reality. Debanjan Mandal, partner of legal firm Fox amp; Mandal, said: Getting an interim enforcement is quickest in Calcutta and the final order takes as much time as in any other big cities of India.        
	If the problem is indeed one of perception, the state has slipped back to where it was a decade ago. The government had then identified perception as the biggest roadblock and went on an overdrive to change it.

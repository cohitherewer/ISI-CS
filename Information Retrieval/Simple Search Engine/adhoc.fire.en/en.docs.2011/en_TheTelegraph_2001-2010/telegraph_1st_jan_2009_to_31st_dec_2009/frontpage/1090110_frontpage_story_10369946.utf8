The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Sonias diktat to Soren: resign first
                                                                                                           Sonias diktat to Soren: resign first
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, Jan. 9: Congress president Sonia Gandhi has conveyed to Shibu Soren, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) chief, that he must immediately resign as the chief minister before looking at other options.        
	Soren, who was in the capital to call on Sonia, was not given time. He met her political secretary Ahmed Patel and party general secretary in charge of Jharkhand Ajay Maken, who were mandated to speak to him on the Congress presidents behalf.         
	Soren was calling on the RJD chief, Lalu Prasad tonight to make a case against dissolving the legislature and allowing the government to continue under the JMMs leadership.         
	JMM sources maintained they had reasons to believe that Lalu had Sonias ears and would be able to prevail on her to endorse a decision in the interests of Jharkhand. They said with the Assembly having a life of another 15 months, there was no point risking an early election.         
	Soren, said Congress sources, unveiled his wish list to Patel and Maken which included getting a second chance to fight a bypoll to retain his chief ministership, making his wife or one of his sons his successor or being reinstated as the coal minister in the Union cabinet. He has not quit his Lok Sabha seat.         
	It is believed the Congress brass was cold to Sorens proposals, as they feared that acceding to any of them would cost the party politically in Jharkhand, give the BJP and the NDA an edge in the next elections and rob Sonia and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of the moral ground they sought to occupy after their recent moves such as allowing the National Conference to have the right of way in the Jammu and Kashmir coalition.        
	Soren was told first resign and only then can we look at other things, a source said.         
	Congress spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed said: The defeat is a setback for the UPA government. The verdict of the people should be honoured. While maintaining that dissolving the Assembly and bringing Jharkhand under central rule was still the Congresss first option, sources admitted that with its nine members, the party could not call the shots. We have done enough experiments in Jharkhand. Our priority is to retain whatever political ground we have, a source said.         
	But they also took note of the fact that the RJD legislature party had passed a resolution against Presidents rule and said it could not have been done without Lalus nod.        
	Hes a more important player than us, they conceded. The Congresss information was Lalu Prasad was still rooting for Sorens predecessor, Madhu Koda, who is also in Delhi to meet Sonia. But he had no luck today.

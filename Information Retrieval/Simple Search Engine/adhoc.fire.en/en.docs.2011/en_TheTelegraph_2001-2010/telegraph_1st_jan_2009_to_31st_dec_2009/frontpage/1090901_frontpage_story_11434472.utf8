  - Militants of rival groups attack villages of rival communities        OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Imphal, Aug. 31: Militants swooped down on a tribal village last night and beat up the male members allegedly to avenge a similar attack on a neighbouring hamlet on Saturday.         
	Security forces today helped restore calm in the two warring villages in Imphal East after the villagers called a truce.         
	Police, quoting villagers, said on Saturday, a group of militants assaulted six residents of Khamenlok village, including a student, accusing them of being informers.         
	The assault came after Assam Rifles and the police launched an operation in the Khamenlok area in which an exchange of fire took place with militants the previous day. No one was injured in the encounter.         
	The villagers could not name the group that came to Khamenlok, but said the militants were Meiteis.         
	In an apparent revenge strike last evening, another group of militants suspected to be from the Kuki National Organisation (KNO)/Kuki National Army (KNA) came to Nongsum village, 2km from Khamenlok, accused the male members of being involved in the previous days incident and beat them up.         
	The militants also ransacked our homes and damaged valuables, a resident of Nongsum said.        
	Khamenlok is a tribal village while the residents of Nongsum are Meiteis.        
	 Furious over the incident, residents of Nongsum blocked the road leading to Khamenlok this morning, not allowing buses and other vehicles to ply. Some villagers also fled to Uyumpok, a neighbouring Meitei village.         
	On being informed of the road blockade, Assam Rifles and police teams rushed to defuse tension. The security forces managed to bring residents of the two villages together and made them hold a meeting.         
	The meeting adopted five resolutions, appealing to all armed groups not to disturb villagers in the area and pledging to maintain peaceful co-existence. The blockade was finally lifted. The villagers also decided to unite against any militant disturbance in the area. The source said Assam Rifles and the police would patrol the area routinely to prevent the entry of militants in these areas in the future.

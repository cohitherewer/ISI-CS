          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            The funeral procession with Subhas Chakrabortys cortege. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                                  
	Calcutta, Aug. 4: What the party didnt give him in life, Subhas Chakraborty claimed in his death  an acceptance of his brand of liberal, non-dogmatic politics.         
	In turning out for the funeral in large numbers, the party faithful raised questions about the style of functioning of the top leaders much in the manner that Chakraborty had done in his life.        
	When he was alive, his party brass accused him of being an advocate of populist politics and decadent culture and rebuked or censured him for provoking controversy defying the ruling dogma. Today, his party lauded him as a darling of the masses following the massive turnout on the streets from all walks of life and the spontaneous outpouring of emotions.         
	For the record, the politburo issued a statement saying Chakraborty was a popular leader. But politburo member Sitaram Yechury, who attended the funeral, appeared to echo the sentiment on the ground when he said: No matter what his position was in the party, he was really a mass leader.        
	The turnout underlined not only Chakrabortys popularity but also the public approval of his unconventional politics of using official power and personal clout to help the needy, irrespective of their party allegiance, as well as the ability to mingle with people from different backgrounds.         
	Some felt that while mourning for Chakraborty, a large section of the party rank and file also sent out the message that it was unhappy over the leadership style of Prakash Karat, Biman Bose and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, which had led to the Left Fronts public alienation and worst poll debacle.         
	The leaders may or may not go for a genuine course correction, but today, they used the public mourning to rally the flock and boost the morale of the ranks after the Lok Sabha poll debacle.        
	The CPM didnt value him properly and offer him his place in the leadership. If the communist party is the party for the masses, it should honour the leaders who have the ability to win peoples hearts. There are many leaders in the party, but people dont cry for all, said Saifuddin Chowdhury, the former CPM MP.        
	Chakrabortys daylong last journey, from his Dum Dum home to the crematorium via Writers Buildings, the Assembly and the state party headquarters, was attended by Left leaders, sportspersons, singers and film stars. Mithun Chakraborty, Sourav Ganguly and Usha Uthup were there, along with many who were not supporters of the CPM or its allies.        
	When former state party secretary Anil Biswas had died in 2006, around 30,000 people gathered at the party headquarters. Biswas was an astute political strategist with control over the mammoth party organisation. And his funeral was largely a party affair.         
	Police said there were about 1 lakh people around the crematorium today.        
	While some like Howrahs Saidul Islam remembered Chakraborty as their personal benefactor, others stressed his ability to reach out to people, including his political rivals. This perhaps compelled ailing former Congress chief minister Siddhartha Shankar Ray to turn up in the Assembly to pay his respects to the much younger Chakraborty.         
	However, not all in the CPM and outside would like to forget Subhasdas limitations in a hurry. His politics of non-partisan benevolence was aimed at developing his personal constituency, they said, and called it a variant of political clientelism.        
	They also pointed out his defence of the mobilisation of militants for polls and resentment over police action against them.         
	While his admirers called him a support for jobless youths, his detractors blamed him for the partys criminalisation, trying to shield goons and turning a blind eye to unruly auto drivers.

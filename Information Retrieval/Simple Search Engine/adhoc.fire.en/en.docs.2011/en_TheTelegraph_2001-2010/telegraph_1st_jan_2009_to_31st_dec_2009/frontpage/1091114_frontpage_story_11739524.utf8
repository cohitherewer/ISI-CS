The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Madhu will be vindicated
                                                                                    Saturday , November 14 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                        Madhu will be vindicated
          JAYESH THAKER                            Rasika Koda at his residence in Patahatu. (Bhola Prasad)                                  
	Patahatu (West Singhbhum), Nov. 13: It is hard to hide pain with reproach and conviction.        
	Visibly worried over his sons present predicament, a grim-faced Rasika Koda deplored Madhu Kodas decision to join politics two decades ago while talking to The Telegraph today.        
	Maine Madhu ko rajniti mein aane se mana kiya lekin woh kehta raha ki usse desh aur samaj ke liye samarpit hona hain. (I had tried to convince Madhu against joining politics, but he said he wanted to devote his life to the country and society), Koda senior said. The problems my son is facing today wouldnt have been there had he abstained from a career in politics. Madhu has lost his sleep and is mired in controversies.        
	Finished with his early morning chore of tilling a few acres of land, Rasika claimed that his son was a victim of political vendetta. We are honest people. I dont believe Madhu has amassed huge wealth as is being claimed by the authorities and the media. Truth will come to the fore soon and my son will be vindicated, the 62-year-old said.        
	Rasika settled on a chaupai at his Patahatu home, some 110km from Jamshedpur, and drew a long breath before continuing his tirade against politics and parties. He asked why the BJP and the JMM had remained silent if his Madhu was allegedly doing all wrong things as chief minister.         
	If he was committing financial irregularities, why was the Opposition mum? Why did the JMM as partner not say a word then? Madhu has been made a scapegoat because his career is shooting, Rasika said, anger palpable in his voice.        
	Koda senior, who stays in a nondescript house with wife Kunikui, also blamed the Congress for engineering the implication of his son in the scam. Yeh sab Dilli ka kiya dhara hai. Mera beta aaropi hai kintu uske khilaf koi praman abhi tak nahin mila hai. (All these problems are being created by Delhi  read Congress. My son is an accused, but there is no evidence against him).        
	Rasika reiterated that if making progress in politics meant inviting trouble, then it was better to stay away. I was and I am against Madhus political career, the former employee of IISCO said.        
	He recalled his experience when income tax officials visited his house a few weeks ago. They asked me questions about Madhu. They asked me how much I earn; what home appliances we own; how much wealth I possess... See, we only have some acres of land.         
	Rasika said he would initiate a campaign to tell people how his family was being targeted. Main logon ke beech jakar sacchai bataunga. (I will go to the people and tell them the truth). A wounded father also rued daughter-in-law Geeta Kodas entry into politics. She has taken the baton from my son. She is contesting the Assembly elections from Jagannathpur. I wish her good luck though I loathe politics.        
	The Kodas and the former chief ministers supporters in Patahatu as well as Jagannathpur were eagerly awaiting Madhu Kodas arrival. He reached his village in the evening.

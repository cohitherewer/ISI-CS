The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Night race on Liberhan report
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Night race on Liberhan report
          SANJAY K. JHA                             Vajpayee                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 23: The Centre was tonight cranking up copying machines in an attempt to table the Liberhan commissions findings by tomorrow or as early as possible following a directive by Sonia Gandhi to take measures to defuse a storm generated by the leak of the purported report on the Babri Masjid demolition.        
	Sonia tonight called a meeting of senior Congress leaders and expressed her concern at the disruption of Parliament for the third consecutive day.        
	Both Houses were paralysed through the day over the leak, the version published by a newspaper suggesting that Atal Bihari Vajpayee was also among those indicted.         
	Conflicting reports flew around about the commissions purported references to Vajpayee with another version saying he had not been directly indicted since he had left Uttar Pradesh on the eve of the demolition on December 6, 1992.        
	A cabinet meeting has been called at 9.30am tomorrow, an hour and half before Parliament meets.         
	The unscheduled meeting was announced after Sonia chaired the Congress huddle, attended by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, home minister P. Chidambaram and defence minister A.K. Antony.        
	Sources said Mukherjee had also spoken to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh who is in Washington as part of a state visit to the US.        
	A senior cabinet minister told The Telegraph: We are trying our best to prepare the ATR (action taken report) and present it before Parliament tomorrow. If everything goes all right, we will table the report tomorrow itself or give a definite date for the purpose. Our problem is that the ATR has to be okayed by the cabinet tomorrow and then it has to be printed. Even the Liberhan report copies have to be made. We have only one report right now but we are trying to make copies.        
	Another source said the home ministry would burn the midnight oil to draw up the ATR to be placed before the cabinet in the morning. Since many of the accused, including BJP leaders, are facing trials at different levels, the government has to take legal opinion before finalising the ATR.         
	Parliamentary affairs minister Pawan Bansal said the government might ask Speaker Meira Kumar for permission to table the report even if adequate copies cannot be made. The government would also like to table the 17-volume report in English alone first as the Hindi translation has not been completed.        
	The sense of urgency set in after the meeting at Sonias residence late in the evening. Gauging Sonias mood, some Congress leaders said there was no point sitting on the report as the leak had put the BJP in an uncomfortable situation and could help divide the Opposition which was showing signs of regrouping after the sugarcane controversy.        
	During the day, some ministers had ruled out the possibility of the report being tabled in a hurry. They had claimed that the cabinet would take it up only after the Prime Minister returned.        
	Many ministers were informed of the cabinet meeting, which will be chaired by Mukherjee, after 8pm. Mamata Banerjee, whose party issued a statement saying the Liberhan report should be tabled early and appropriate steps taken against the guilty, is in Calcutta.        
	Chidambaram said the leak was unfortunate and the only copy available in the home ministry was in safe custody. An angry Liberhan denied he was the source of the leak.

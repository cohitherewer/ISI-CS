  - Troops fan out amid red shadow
          AMIT GUPTA                                                    
	Ranchi, Jan. 4: More than one-and-a-half lakh voters of Naxalite-ravaged Tamar constituency would decide Gurujis future as chief minister tomorrow in what has turned out to be a keen contest amid unprecedented security involving over 50 companies of central paramilitary and state police forces.        
	All the 247 polling booths  housed in 204 buildings have been designated sensitive, with 180 of them being labelled super-sensitive. Tamar block has 111 booths followed by 76 in Bundu, which includes the SS High School where former MLA Ramesh Singh Munda was gunned down by suspected rebels on July 9 necessitating the bypoll, and 60 in Arki block.         
	Voting will be held between 7am and 3pm so as to end the poll process well before sundown  only 123 booths are connected by motorable roads, while the rest are along narrow village paths. Today, security forces were conducting special surveillance and sanitising operations to pre-empt rebels from planting landmines on the roads leading to the booths.        
	Around 1,500 government employees have been deputed for various poll duties, namely as presiding officers, polling officials, patrolling magistrates, EVM supervisors and micro-observers.         
	The idea behind ending polling early is to allow these officials to return from the booths before dark.        
	Shibu Soren, a Lok Sabha MP from Dumka became chief minister on August 27 after brokering a deal with the Congress who helped him oust Madhu Koda in exchange for the support of JMM MPs in the trust vote in Parliament.        
	Now he has to become a member of the state legislature by February 27 so as to remain in the hot seat.         
	But the Tamar bypoll isnt proving a cakewalk with the JMM chief being challenged by Jharkhand Party (Anosh) candidate Gopal Krishna Patar, alias Raja Peter, NDA nominee Vasundhara Devi (widow of slain JD(U) MLA Ramesh Singh Munda) and AJSU (Sudesh Mahto faction) candidate Vijay Singh Manki.         
	Ranchi district sub-election officer C.K. Singh told The Telegraph, the poll process will be video recorded too. Over 30 teams of cameramen have been deputed for this job, Singh said.         
	CRPF DIG Alok Raj hoped the central para military forces, including 25 CRPF and eight BSF companies, would ensure fair and impartial elections.        
	Ranchi deputy commissioner Rajiv Arun Ekka, senior superintendent of police Sampat Meena and Bundu sub-divisional officer A K Poddar (acting as returning officer) addressed a joint press conference in Bundu to talk about the extensive security arrangements.         
	There will be 33 companies of central para military forces and 83 patrolling parties along with magistrates would be active throughout the day. Each booth would have minimum of 17 police personnel, said Ekka.        
	NDA complaint        
	The NDA shot off a letter to the Election Commission today, alleging that thousands of unauthorised people in vehicles (without any flags or banners) had entered Arki block of the Tamar constituency.         
	We fear that these unauthorised persons who are not voters of Tamar constituency may be used by the JMM for booth capturing and bogus voting, the NDA letter, jointly signed by JD(U) state spokesperson Pramod Mishra as well as BJPs state spokesperson Umashankar Kedia, said.         
	The NDA has urged the Election Commission to ensure strict implementation of the model code of conduct.

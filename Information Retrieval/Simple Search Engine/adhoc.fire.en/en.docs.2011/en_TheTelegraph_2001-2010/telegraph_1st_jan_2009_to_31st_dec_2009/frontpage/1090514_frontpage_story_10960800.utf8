	Islamabad, May 13 (Reuters): Pakistans moderate clerics, for years mute in the face of growing Islamist influence, are mobilising support for the government as it battles the Taliban, warning that militants could take over the country.        
	Most of predominantly Islamic Pakistans 160 million people are moderate Muslims, but for years they have been reluctant to speak out against the spread of the hardline Taliban. Not any more.        
	The military must eliminate the Taliban once and for all, Mufti Sarfraz Naeemi, a senior cleric of the moderate Barelvi branch of Sunnis, said. Otherwise they will capture the entire country which would be a big catastrophe.        
	Naeemi said the Barelvis had wanted to avoid confrontation with the Taliban so had not spoken out against aggression.

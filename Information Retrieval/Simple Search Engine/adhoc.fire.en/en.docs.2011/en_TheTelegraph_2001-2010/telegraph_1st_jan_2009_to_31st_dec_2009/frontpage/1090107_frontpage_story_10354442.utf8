          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Siliguri, Jan. 6: The body of a 16-year-old Bangladeshi was found in a hotel room on Sevoke Road today. In the past five days, Md Abdul Aziz is the second student from Delhi Pubic School here to have committed suicide.         
	A resident of Chittagong, the Class X boy had checked into the room on Sunday night. Police suspect that he killed himself because of some love-related matter.         
	We received a phone call from the hotel around 1.30am that one of its boarders had locked himself in room 102. He was not responding even though the hotel staff had knocked on the door several times, Prabhat Chakraborty, the inspector-in-charge of Siliguri police station, said.         
	We broke open the door and found the body on the bed. The television was on and he was holding the remote. He was frothing at the mouth and two letters, probably addressed to a friend, lying beside him, he said. We suspect the boy has committed suicide by consuming poison. The body has been sent for post-mortem.         
	Mamta Nicholas, the owner of the private hostel where the boy stayed, said Aziz had left the hostel on December 31 evening.         
	We keep seven other students here and he was the only one who stayed back for examinations. The rest have gone home for Christmas. We allowed him to go out for a movie and repeatedly told him to return soon, she said, adding that Aziz often stayed with friends for the night.        
	On January 1, Aziz had called up Nicholas to say that he would return shortly. However, when he did not come even on the next day, we informed his parents in Bangladesh and his local guardian here. This morning we came to know that he was dead, Nicholas said.         
	S.P. Das, the principal, of Delhi Public School, said Aziz was one of the top athletes of the institution. We were the first to inform his parents in Bangladesh.        
	On New Years Day, the body of 13-year-old Sayeri Bose was found hanging at her flat in Deshbandhupara here. A student of the same school as Azizs, Sayeri, too, stayed in a private hostel and had come home for Christmas. The previous day the Class VII student had been spotted by the police standing on a field as if dazed.         
	The police said they have gone through Azizs letters, both written in English.         
	He seemed to be have been disappointed about something and had repeatedly apologised to somebody whose name is not written. The sentences appear disconnected and it will take time to make something out of them, an officer said.        
	The Bangladesh Deputy High Commission in Calcutta has been informed.

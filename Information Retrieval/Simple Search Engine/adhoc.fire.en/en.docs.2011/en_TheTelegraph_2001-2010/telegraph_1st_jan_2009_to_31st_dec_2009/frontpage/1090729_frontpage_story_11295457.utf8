  Stung by sex scandal slur, Omar stuns country with stepdown          MUZAFFAR RAINA                            Omar Abdullahs sister Safiya runs towards his residence on hearing about his resignation. (PTI)                                        
	Srinagar, July 28: Guilty till proven innocent  Omar Abdullah has sought to turn on its head an evolved law governing public life in the biggest gamble of his career.        
	Omar tendered a conditional resignation after he was accused by an Opposition legislator in the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly of being a suspect in a three-year-old sex scandal, the countrys youngest chief minister falling back on an old tradition associated with a bygone era.        
	Justice demands that a person is innocent unless proven guilty. It can be true, perhaps, in cases involving theft and robbery. But so far as the (kind of) false allegations levelled against me are concerned, the fact is, I am guilty unless proven innocent, the 37-year-old chief minister told the Assembly, setting off scenes rarely seen in legislatures and making gripping television.        
	As his party colleagues fell over one another  and sometimes over Omar also  besieging and beseeching him to reconsider his decision, the chief minister wriggled himself free, recovered from a stumble and strode out in pursuit of the eventual destination, the governors house, where he put in his papers.        
	Muzaffar Baig, a former deputy chief minister and senior MLA of the Peoples Democratic Party, set the stage in the morning for one of the most stunning days in Indian legislature history.        
	Baig told the House that Omars name figured in the CBIs list of suspects  at serial number 102. The bureau has been investigating the case, which rocked the state in 2006 and led to the arrest of two ministers in the then ruling PDP-Congress combine, on orders of the high court.         
	In the evening, Union home minister P. Chidambaram said in New Delhi that Omar did not figure in the list of accused prepared by the CBI. The bureau had questioned 37 people and chargesheeted 17, whose trial is on in a sessions court in Chandigarh.        
	But Omar handed over his resignation to Governor N.N. Vohra in the evening.        
	Those who lead must not only be clean but also look to be clean. At the end of the day, all one has is ones personal credibility and self-respect. Both of these Mr Baig tried to snatch from me through the charges he levelled, Omar told Vohra.                  National Conference MLAs try to dissuade Omar from leaving for Raj Bhavan to resign. (PTI)      
	A Raj Bhavan spokesperson said Omar had demanded a time-bound inquiry into the allegations. Vohra has asked Omar to continue in office till the final decision is taken.         
	Baig, a Supreme Court lawyer, started his address with human rights violations, focusing on the Shopian rape and murder and then brought in the 2006 sex scandal.         
	He glanced at a few pages, which he claimed was a list of suspects from the sex scandal, and asked Speaker Akbar Lone to have a look at who figures at serial number 102. Before the Speaker could react, the PDP leader said the man was no other than Omar Abdullah, son of Farooq Abdullah.         
	Baig later said Farooq, now a Union minister, too figured in the list, at number 38. The PDP legislator toned down his allegation at a news briefing later, saying the two could well be exonerated by the high court as they were on the list of suspects and not accused.        
	The scandal broke in 2006 and led to massive protests as the names of some high-profile ministers, politicians, bureaucrats and police officers figured in it.        
	Baigs statement stunned the House, simmering since yesterday. PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti, who had yanked and hurled a mike on Monday, led the sloganeering, seeking action against serial number 102.        
	Omar sat back, his face flushed, as his National Conference MLAs charged back. He appeared to be struggling to hold back his tears, making repeated attempts to speak. The Speaker tried to silence the legislators, sometimes using harsh words.        
	Omar was seen shouting at his men to allow him to speak. Suddenly, there was silence. The chief minister stood up and spoke his heart out.         
	I thank Allah that they (PDP men) have finally spoken what they have been hinting at all these years, Omar said, his intensity reminiscent of his feisty defence of the nuclear deal in the Lok Sabha a year ago.        
	Omar said Baigs claim was a blot on him. If you expunge these remarks, order an inquiry by the home department, it would be futile. I will not be able to work. I am going to the governors house to tender my resignation, he said.         
	The chief minister began walking out, but found himself barricaded by his legislators. If you want to see me back on this chair, allow me to take this decision, Omar replied.        
	Party legislator Sajjad Kichloo, along with others, caught hold of his coat and forced him to take the seat. But Omar didnt relent and headed for his residence from where father Farooq accompanied him to Raj Bhavan.         
	Scores of people descended on Omars residence in scenes equalling in intensity the swell of support for Sonia Gandhi when she had resigned as Congress president over the attack on her foreign origin a decade ago.         
	The resignation could help the young chief minister weather the political crisis he is facing after the Shopian rape and murder controversy.        
	But it is an unfinished journey: by insisting that I cannot work till I am proved innocent, Omar has opened himself up to intense, unyielding scrutiny.        
	If he can come out unscathed, he would have fortified himself with an unassailable armour of morality. It will also mean he would have succeeded in raising the bar for other politicians.        
	However, should any skeleton tumble out or dirty tricks departments manage to make the mud stick, it will be difficult for Omar to recover.

                                                                                                           UDP rally protests Presidents rule 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Shillong, March 28: The rally organised by the United Democratic Party, the coalition partner of the Meghalaya Progressive Alliance, here today passed a resolution urging Governor R.S. Mooshahary to revoke the Presidents rule and install the MPA government.         
	The rally, held amid tight security and attended by a large gathering at the Malki ground here, protested against the Presidents rule imposed by the Centre on March 18 despite the MPA winning the trust vote a day before.         
	Though the rally was organised by the UDP, members of all the MPA coalition partners took part in it.         
	Placards and banners put up at the ground read, No Presidents rule, no Lapang rule, whole seller wants to buy UDP, HSPDP MLAs and Revoke President rule. One of the placards warned Assam Congress leader and health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma not to meddle in Meghalaya politics.        
	HSPDP legislator Adviser Pariong, who had earlier deserted the MPA, was present at the rally.         
	Former chief minister Donkupar Roy said Presidents rule was imposed in the state just to pave way for the Congress to form the government. He said the move indicated that the Centre did not want the regional parties and its allies under the MPA to rule the state. He said in 1991, Presidents rule was imposed just because the Congress was not in power in the state.         
	He also expressed concern over the stand of the five legislators who had deserted the MPA. The MPA was formed with a pledge to work together, but unfortunately, there were some black sheep in the alliance who betrayed the pledge, he said.         
	Roy said despite the present setback, the UDP would in no way betray its friends in the MPA.         
	He lambasted the Assam health minister for interfering in the political affairs of the state and CLP leader D.D. Lapang for recommending imposition of Presidents rule.         
	He, however, lauded Speaker Bindo Lanong for exercising his powers according to the rule of the law.         
	Roy urged the people to think properly before electing the betrayers and to vote against the Congress during the parliamentary elections.         
	Former deputy chief minister and HSPDP president, H.S. Lyngdoh, said it was unfortunate that the leaders who had pledged to form the MPA had destroyed the unity of the alliance.         
	Former education minister and Independent legislator Manas Chaudhuri said the Congress tried to buy legislators with money, offering important posts.         
	MPA secretary and NCP legislator Conrad Sangma said the alliance had prepared good policies for the development of the state, but the Congress was busy toppling the government, that too with the help of the Assam Congress.         
	We will not allow people from outside the state to control and rule us, he said.         
	BJP legislator A.L. Hek said the Congress had in the past resorted to Presidents rule in many other states in the country whenever they wanted to grab power.

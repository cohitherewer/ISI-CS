	New Delhi, March 17: Lalu Prasads mini coup in Bihar has not only angered the Congress but rekindled its latent distrust and discomfort with alliances in general.        
	The unease is more since the RJD boss topped Sonia Gandhis list of favourite allies. When most Congress leaders were defensive and even apologetic over her foreign origin, Lalu had defended her against the BJPs campaign and called her the nations bahu.        
	Sources close to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said he had privately chafed at the DMK and other Tamil Nadu allies for tripping up on the finer points of official propriety, but Lalu had so far given no cause for complaint.        
	So, when the railway minister and Ram Vilas Paswan, his colleague from the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), unilaterally declared the seats for Bihar, giving just three to the Congress (one less than in 2004), Sonia and her political aides apparently didnt know what hit them.        
	Later, when Lalu Prasad sought time from the Congress chief for an afternoon meeting, he was refused.        
	Sonia regarded Paswan well. He is her neighbour and despite her security regimen, she is known to walk across to his house. Paswans living room exhibits a picture of himself with her taken on a winter morning in 2003, shortly after he had walked out of the NDA to protest the Gujarat violence.        
	Sonia had then come over and had breakfast with him. That meeting culminated in the Bihar coalition that yielded enough seats to become a major pillar of the UPA after the last Lok Sabha polls.        
	The pillar has cracked, rued a Congress general secretary.        
	Although many Congress officials felt it was a bit late in the day to debate fighting an election with multiple partners or solo, Lalu Prasads move has cast its shadow over seat-sharing negotiations in Maharashtra and, to a smaller extent, in Tamil Nadu. Uttar Pradesh is virtually off the radar.        
	Union minister Sushil Shinde, who heads the Bihar candidates screening committee, ruled out the prospect of a rapprochement with Lalu Prasad and Paswan.        
	The offer is unacceptable. Our workers are in so much anger. We were co-operative from the beginning but they have not reciprocated. Our workers are saying we should contest as many seats as we can. If we dont heed their sentiments, how can we show our faces to them? asked Shinde.        
	Not only is the Congress claiming that it will fight 20 seats, it is also doing a bout of grandstanding by offering tickets to Lalu Prasads rebels such as his brother-in-law Sadhu Yadav, Ramai Ram and Jainarain Nishad. They were spotted at Shindes house.

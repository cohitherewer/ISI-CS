The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Bollywood loses Swarups Six to BBC
                                                                                                           Bollywood loses Swarups Six to BBC

	Washington, Feb. 24: Vikas Swarup, who finished writing Q amp;A on an impulse five-and-a-half-years ago, paving the way to a downpour of golden statuettes on Slumdog Millionaire at the Oscars, held out till the end for Bollywood to pick up Six Suspects, his second book, for a movie.        
	The BBC and Starfield Productions of the UK are currently finalising a screenplay writer in the next stage of making Six Suspects into a film, Swarup, who wears another hat as Indias deputy high commissioner in Pretoria, told The Telegraph from Los Angeles after a raucous night at Kodak Theatre and a party to celebrate Slumdogs success.        
	He declined to speculate if Six Suspects will see a repetition of the runaway success of Q amp;A, both as a book and then as a movie, but those who read Tarot cards in the film industry are talking about a second similar course for the diplomat-turned-author from Allahabad.        
	Their predictions come from Britains Radio 4 opting to make a radio play of Six Suspects in less than six months after the books publication.        
	The BBC is already producing an audio-book of Swarups new novel, which is also being translated into 10 languages.        
	The author said he wanted Bollywood to have a go at making a film out of his second book, a thriller which has its genesis in the so-called Jessica Lal murder case in New Delhi, in which a barmaid was shot dead in 1999 for refusing to serve drinks after hours to the son of a powerful politician.        
	But the BBC and Starfield Productions expressed interest in global rights, including Indian rights, when Swarup tried to separate the two.        
	He said negotiations were then launched in Mumbai to bring Bollywood into the picture, but Swarups well-wishers in the Indian film industry advised him to go with the BBC when they considered the opportunity that a BBC-Starfield tie-up offered.        
	Q amp;A, which was an instant success when the book came out, has meekly surrendered to Slumdog Millionaire. The books author is wistful of the days when it was all his work and he had control over his own destiny as a writer.        
	Q amp;A is no longer selling solely under its original title in bookshops. The books cover has been changed and its title is now Slumdog Millionaire, the written word having been overrun by the celluloid screen.        
	Swarup said he protested when the publishers wanted to change the name of the book he was proud to have written, but the feedback after the films success was that people were walking into bookshops and asking for copies of Slumdog Millionaire.         
	In a few instances, bookshops which had not yet heard of the film during its early weeks of release told prospective buyers that there was no such book in their catalogue. Purely in cash register terms, the publishers decision to re-christen the book has made sense. In just one month after the films release, it sold 175,000 copies as Slumdog Millionaire. In the US 128,000 have been printed with the new title. The book has been translated into 36 languages and it is now the No.1 bestseller in Israel and in Taiwan, among other countries. Swarup is to shortly go to Japan to promote the Japanese edition.        
	It is some satisfaction to the author that bookstores are still keeping the edition of the novel under the title that Swarup was used to. And it is some consolation that the new cover mentions that the book was originally published under the title, Q amp;A. Swarup told The Telegraph that he is working on his third book, but declined to discuss too much by way of detail.        
	I am still conceptualising my next book. But I can tell you that, for a change, it will not be set in India. It will be different.

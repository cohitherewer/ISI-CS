          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               Karat, Sen: Argumentative Indians				                                 
	New Delhi, Aug. 14: In his fraternal argument with Amartya Sen, Prakash Karat both agrees and disagrees with the economist.        
	The CPM general secretary agrees with Sen that the Left Front government in Bengal needs to do more for primary education, literacy and health. But he disagrees with Sens criticism that the Left had neglected the issues of hunger, malnutrition and illiteracy and focused on the nuclear deal which, according to Sen, is not a central issue for social justice in India.        
	This is simply not true, Karat says in an article, A Fraternal Argument with Dr Sen, in the latest issue of party mouthpiece Peoples Democracy, citing an interview with Sen carried by The Telegraph on June 22.        
	He was right in pointing out that the Left Front government of West Bengal needs to do more in the spheres of primary education, literacy and health, Karat says.        
	At the national level, he would be right to say that the Left needs to do much more to bring the issues of hunger, malnutrition, illiteracy and deprivation to the forefront.        
	But, Karat writes, the Lefts opposition to the nuclear deal did not mean it had focused exclusively on ties with the US. He says that throughout the period the Left supported the previous UPA government, it had raised vital issues of welfare and social justice.        
	A look at the record would confirm that the Left consistently took up the issues of food security and the public distribution system, the rural employment guarantee scheme, the impact of WTO (World Trade Organisation) rules on agriculture and farmers, land rights for tribal people, the need for greater allocations for health and education in Union budgets, and the whole gamut of neo-liberal policies that adversely affected the well-being of the Indian people, he writes.        
	Karat says the two major pieces of legislation adopted during this period, the rural job guarantee act and the law on forest dwellers rights, bear the hallmarks of the intervention by the Left in their texts.        
	If the allocations for health and education in Union budgets showed an increase in this period, some credit should also be given to the Left for bringing this demand into the limelight.        
	Karat argues that the Left was not influenced by any gut anti-Americanism or any exaggerated fear of the power of the US but a recognition that the neo-liberal policies pursued by the Indian ruling classes get their greatest sustenance from the strategic link with the US.        
	This link not only affects foreign policy but the domestic economic agenda as well. The struggle for a better life for the people and fight against imperialist domination have to go together.        
	Karat believes that Sen shares the common social-democratic assumption that imperialism is a thing of the past and that imperialist-driven globalisation with its twin instruments of neo-liberal policies and military interventions are not germane to the central issues of social justice.        
	Fortunately, the Left in India has not, so far, delinked its fight for social justice and against social and economic exploitation from the fight against the predatory neo-liberal policies perpetuated by imperialism, Karat writes.        
	The inability to recognise this role of the Left leads Dr Sen virtually to recommend that the Left play a subsidiary role, one of supporting the Congress, or at best to act as a sort of Left wing of the Congress party.

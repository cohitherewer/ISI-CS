The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Jawan kills six colleagues
                                                                                                           Jawan kills six colleagues
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                              
	Imphal, Jan. 21: An Assam Rifles jawan shot dead six of his colleagues and fled with several weapons from a paramilitary camp in Manipurs Ukhrul tonight, officials said.        
	The carnage and flight coincided with a confirmation by the Assam Rifles that its troops have surrounded a camp of suspected Naga militants 10km away in the same Manipur district. A flare-up is being prevented by the women of the Naga-dominated village, sources said.        
	The fugitive jawan is said to be Naga but officials denied any link between the two events.        
	The murder of the six could be the single biggest instance of fragging  uniformed personnel killing colleagues  in the country.         
	Such incidents are usually reported from high-stress zones like Kashmir where soldiers sometimes open fire on superiors to avenge grievances such as denial of leave or perceived harassment. But rarely has a jawan been accused of murdering so many colleagues at one go for stealing weapons.        
	The circumstances that led to the attack around 7pm in Manipurs Ukhrul district were not clear till late tonight. But police sources said the jawan of the Assam Rifles, a paramilitary force that has officers from the regular army, escaped from the camp with weapons, including those of his slain colleagues.        
	Assam Rifles spokesperson Major Shamsher Jung said the dead included a junior commissioned officer. However, we are still trying to gather the details on how the incident happened. I can only say that the jawan who pulled the trigger escaped even before anyone could realise what had happened, the major said in Imphal.        
	The paramilitary campsite  at Awang Kasom  is nearly 85-90km from Imphal. The camp is around 25km to 30km from Ukhrul and is located in a forest, a police officer said. The Assam Rifles spokesperson said a strong contingent of our soldiers and police has launched a search.        
	The village where Assam Rifles jawans are locked in a stand-off with suspected Naga militants is called Siroi.         
	The jawans had stumbled on camp-like construction in Siroi and found several NSCN (Isak-Muivah) cadres there. Construction of militant camps outside Nagaland violates a ceasefire agreement now in force between the government and the insurgents.        
	A resident said women of a village have placed themselves between the jawans and the militants  the sole reason a shootout has not broken out till this evening. Sources said several social organisations have intervened and are trying to work out a peaceful solution.

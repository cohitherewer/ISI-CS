          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Shillong, July 16: The third inquiry report into the May 31 Shillong jailbreak, made public by chief minister D.D. Lapang today, accuses Meghalaya DGP Anil Pradhan of feigning ignorance about dropping of charges against Congress politician Thomas Nongtdu who allegedly funded the escape.        
	Before this administrative inquiry, a magisterial and a departmental probe had examined all the aspects related to the escape of seven undertrial prisoners from Shillong jail.        
	The fresh inquiry conducted by the principal secretary, home, Barkos Warjri, says according to East Khasi Hills superintendent of police L.B. Rapthap and deputy superintendent of police (crime) Vivek Syiem, Pradhan had directed them to drop all charges against Nongtdu.         
	He had also directed the SP to show him the draft discharge petition before it was submitted to the court.         
	However, in his submission before the inquiry official, the DGP said he had nothing to do with the decision to release Nongtdu, the Congress-nominated member of Jaintia Hills Autonomous District Council.         
	Pradhan had also insisted that the case against Nongtdu was not discharged or dropped, only bail was granted. However, the case was dropped against Nongtdu and he was released without unconditionally on June 5 after being arrested on June 3.         
	The administrative inquiry report concludes that the DGPs self-professed lack of knowledge on the decision taken and of facts does not reflect well on the authority in the functioning of the state police. The DGP also should have been aware of how the case was closed.        
	 It says awareness by the seniormost police officer was expected in such a sensitive case. The report pulls up the DGP indirectly by saying that the handling of the case did not reflect a well-planned and professional approach. There seems to have been panic reactions to specific situations. The report says the decision to arrest Nongtdu was taken at the level of DGP and adds that neither the arrest nor the dropping of all charges should have been carried out in a hurry.         
	It says while the arrest of Nongtdu may have been necessary, it is the timing which seems to have suffered, indicating that the police could have waited for the best time after strengthening the case to effect the arrest.         
	According to senior police officials, pressure from NGOs and the media made the police act in haste in arresting Nongtdu.         
	The report says the police should not have succumbed to any kind of pressure.         
	The inquiry also blamed the SP for allowing the media to meet and take photograph of Evatiplang Kharkongor, the girlfriend of jailbreak gang leader Full Moon Dhar. Kharkongor had collected money from Nongtdu and handed it over to Dhar.               
	According to Warjri, the departmental inquiry also revealed a lack of involvement at some levels. The DIG, Eastern range, D.K. Rapthap did not seem to be aware of the developments of the case except when he had gone to Jaintia Hills along with IGP (law and order) B.L. Buam to oversee the operations to recapture the escaped undertrial prisoners.         
	Later Rapthap clearly appeared to have been somewhat distant from the case, without apparent effort to keep abreast of the developments, though he was the DIG of the range.         
	The first term of reference of the inquiry was to investigate the facts and circumstances leading to the release of Nongtdu and dropping of all charges.         
	The second and the last term of reference was to inquire into the alleged politician-criminal linkage in the case.         
	Regarding this, the report said that efforts were made to inquire into the politician-criminal nexus, but it became clear that in a time bound inquiry of this kind, it is difficult to determine with any certainty any nexus between a politician and a criminal.

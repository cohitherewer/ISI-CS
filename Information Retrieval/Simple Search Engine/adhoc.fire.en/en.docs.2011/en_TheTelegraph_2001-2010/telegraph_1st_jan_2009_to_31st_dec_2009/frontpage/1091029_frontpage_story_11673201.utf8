The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Lock looms on coal mountain 
                                                                                                           Lock looms on coal mountain 
          SAMBIT SAHA AND SRIKUMAR BANDYOPADHYAY                                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 28: The Bengal government has taken the first tangible step to facilitate an airport project which could bury forever coal sufficient to meet the countrys demand for nearly four years despite claims that the issue had been resolved.         
	The government this week handed over 533.51 acres  the first tranche of over 3,000 acres  to Bengal Aerotropolis Project Ltd for developing an airport city at Andal in Burdwan. Singapores Changi is a strategic equity partner.        
	The land parcel that changed hands will be the site for the airport itself, expected to come up over 650 acres.        
	However, the project area also sits over huge coal reserves  an issue Coal India Ltd (CIL) had raised when the airport city was conceived. A meeting convened by the Bengal chief secretary on April 8 had reasonably addressed the concerns of CIL by slicing 400 acres off the project to save the coal reserves.        
	The chief secretary wrote to the civil aviation secretary on April 23 saying the issue had been resolved and the CIL representative had agreed to the realignment.        
	But coal industry sources point out that the realignment will help save only 300 million tonnes of coal. Nearly seven times that quantity (2,055 million tonnes) will still be locked under the soil, out of reach for use by the country if the project comes up.        
	The size of the buried natural resource  whose location cannot be shifted unlike that of an airport  is equivalent to what the country uses up in four years. India now imports over 50 million tonnes of coal to meet domestic demand.        
	Keeping the fate of the reserves in mind, the government had agreed to relocate three steel plant projects but chose to retain the airport venture.        
	Advocates of the airport city put the reserves at 1,400 million tonnes, not 2,055 million tonnes still locked. But an industry expert pointed out: The lower figure is reached by estimating what lies vertically below the surface. But you will need a much larger space  like a pyramid  to prevent subsidence while mining.         
	Another argument put forth against mining is depth. Some contend that the coal deposits are 600-1,250 metres below the surface, which is too deep to mine. But a CIL official said: The argument is not valid. We are mining coal from a depth of 800 metres at our Chinakuri mine near Asansol.

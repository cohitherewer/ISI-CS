The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Azad to look into quota raise appeal
                                                                                                           Azad to look into quota raise appeal
          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	Guwahati, Oct. 1: The Centre today agreed to look into Assams appeal to increase its share of post-graduate medical seats from the existing 50 per cent as a special case.         
	The assurance was given by Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad during the daylong review meeting of the National Rural Health Mission with health ministers and health secretaries of the Northeast at the Administrative Staff College here.         
	Before him, Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma made a strong case to increase the state quota from 50 per cent to 75 per cent to improve the health sector.         
	Assam has 246 post-graduate seats in its three medical colleges, of which 123 seats are reserved for candidates from outside the state. Of the remaining 50 per cent, two seats are reserved for the North Eastern Council.         
	Sarma said the state needs at least 500 gynaecologists and 500 anaesthetists in the next five years, apart from other specialists. To mobilise support for his move, Sarma also said if the Centre agreed, then Assam was ready to contribute 25 per cent of the all-India quota to the northeastern states which were also facing acute shortage of specialists. This elicited a round of applause from participants from the region.         
	Given the all-round support to Sarmas appeal, Azad said the issue would be looked into. If you get relaxation for a few years your problems will be taken care of.         
	The Union health minister said he was for setting up of hospitals in the char areas with a population of 3,000 to 5,000. This was also one of the proposals by Assam, which had moved the National Rural Health Mission to set up 50 hospitals in the char areas. The areas have 30 health centres.         
	At the end of Assams presentation, Azad sought both the hard and soft copies of Sarmas speech.         
	Throughout the review, Azad said the Centre would make attempts to improve the health sector in the Northeast. But he said the state governments should also give special attention to the health sector and allocate more resources so that more people can be provided proper care as health is a state subject.         
	Besides lauding the Northeast for initiatives like boat clinics, telemedicine and management of health centres by NGOs, Azad, in his first visit as health minister, did not forget to subtly point out the problem areas.         
	Immunisation of children in the region, like many other states, was not satisfactory. We need to achieve 100 per cent immunisation. To ensure this, it is necessary to keep information on all children and track dropout cases.        
	He also wanted the government to make special efforts to combat malaria and encephalitis, a major concern in Assam.         
	He also pointed out the high maternal mortality rate in Assam which was more than the national average.         
	Sarma in his presentation, however, said things have improved in the past two years.         
	Azad also harped on rationalisation of available workforce in remote and peripheral areas of the region as there appeared to be concentration of trained/specialists manpower in the capital and district headquarters.

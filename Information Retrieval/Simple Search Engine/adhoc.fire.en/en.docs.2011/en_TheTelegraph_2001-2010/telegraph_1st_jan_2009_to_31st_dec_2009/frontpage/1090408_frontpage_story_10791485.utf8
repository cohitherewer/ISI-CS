          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                              
	Guwahati, April 7: A Dutch tourist was trampled to death by a wild elephant at Kaziranga National Park today after insisting on staying and clicking pictures while his friends and guide moved away from the animal.        
	Robert William Goldbrach, 55, was visiting the national park, 250km east of Guwahati, with eight other foreign tourists  four British, three Dutch and an Australian  including a woman.        
	They were walking through Kazirangas Panbari reserve forest  a draw for birdwatchers but home also to the ape species hoolock gibbon  with a guide and an armed forest guard when they ran into a wild makhana (young male elephant).        
	Wed started around 6.30am. The foreigners were thrilled to spot an Asian paradise flycatcher, a rare bird species. Around 9, we suddenly saw a huge elephant just 10 metres away. It was staring at us and I sensed trouble, guide Abidur Rahman said.        
	Rahman, who has been a guide for four years, said he asked everyone to leave the spot but an excited Goldbrach insisted on taking snapshots first. The guard, Subash Senapati, stayed with him as I moved away with the others, Rahman said. When about 30 metres from the spot, he heard gunshots.        
	Senapati said the elephant had charged at them a few minutes after the others had left. I fired three bullets in the air but it kept charging at us. I ran away shouting at the tourist to run, too, he said.         
	Then I heard a sound as though the elephant was crashing into trees. Then I heard screams. When I ran back, I saw the tourists lifeless body tangled up in the creepers between two trees.        
	Wildlife expert Mrinal Chatterjee of the Institute of Climbers and Nature Lovers said wild elephants could be unpredictable and one mustnt take any chances with them. The tourist should have immediately followed the guides instructions. From my experience, I can say the close human presence must have provoked the elephant.        
	In 1998, Mary Brumder, an 80-year-old tourist from the US, had died in Kaziranga after getting trapped in a fight between two elephants that were ferrying tourists.        
	Kaziranga director S.N. Buragohain said Goldbrach was carrying an ordinary digital camera and did not appear to be a professional photographer. He said he didnt expect tourist arrivals to be affected. It was an accident. (Accidents) are not uncommon in the wilds. He added that foreigners made up 30,000-35,000 of the 80,000 visitors at the park every year.         
	A tea garden labourer, Meena Thengal, 40, was later killed by a wild elephant near the Numaligarh Refinery, 20km away. Forest officials were unsure if it was the same elephant.

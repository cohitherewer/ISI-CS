          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 13: Senior CPM leader and minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah said today the people had rejected the party, a sundering time would not heal even if elections were held as scheduled in 2011.        
	A day after the partys state secretariat dismissed the possibility of early polls, Mollah, the land and land reforms minister, appeared to trash this opinion in a public display that would qualify in the CPM as gross indiscipline.         
	Those opposed to early polls are the ones who apply olive oil to keep their skin glowing. However, you can find the stink of soil and kerosene on my body, he said at Writers Buildings.        
	People would not vote for the party, he added, whether or not there was an alliance between Trinamul and the Congress and that nothing would change between now and 2011.         
	Things wont change with inspection of large areas of land (Bhel was shown the Singur plot yesterday) or with the setting up of big industries. The people have rejected the CPM. They wont vote for our party, Mollah said.        
	If the alliance between Trinamul and Congress breaks down, as some people are hoping, the reality will not change. They (the people) are not with us.        
	Mollah, who fell out with the chief minister over land acquisition for industry, said it would become clear who wanted what at the meeting of the CPM state committee, of which he is a member. There are some in our party who want early elections while a section is against it.        
	Mollahs outburst came soon after a Left Front minister, Kiranmoy Nanda, said the government had lost the peoples support and should seek a fresh mandate.        
	A CPM minister had expressed a similar opinion.        
	Some in the CPM admit this is a sign of the party  and the government  losing control over its leaders who have started questioning decisions taken by the powerful secretariat.         
	Now that the party is on a downslide, even our own ministers have started taking pot shots at it, said a state committee member.         
	Rezzakda has merely used the crisis to speak against it. However, he is right in saying the CPM should now concentrate less on big industries as land has proved to be a crucial issue. Any move to snatch land from poor farmers would again give Trinamul an advantage, he added.        
	Another party leader said Mollah should speak at the right forum, which would be provided by the state committee meeting on November 29-30.        
	If he differs with the secretariat decision against early polls, he should say that at the meeting. If he doesnt, it would mean that he simply wants to be a colourful leader like Subhasda (Chakraborty), the leader added.

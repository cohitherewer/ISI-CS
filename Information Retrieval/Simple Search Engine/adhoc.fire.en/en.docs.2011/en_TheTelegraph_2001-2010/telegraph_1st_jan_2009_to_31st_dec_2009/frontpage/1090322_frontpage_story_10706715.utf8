  - Internal probe on colonel role in Malegaon blast widened           SUJAN DUTTA                             Purohit                                        
	New Delhi, March 21: The army has widened and deepened an internal investigation to find out if Lieutenant Colonel Prasad Srikant Purohit, the officer arrested on a terror charge in the Malegaon blast case, was linked to a network that was tapping more recruits from a particular linguistic and suspected casteist group within the soldiery.         
	The investigation is a counter-intelligence exercise, a source in army headquarters has confirmed to The Telegraph. The armys counter- intelligence drive is essentially aimed at working out ways to keep a watch over the Praetorian Guard.         
	A fact-finding three-member court of inquiry headed by a brigadier has been given the brief to probe:         
	A possible collusion in the stockpiling and/or procurement of weapons/explosives and/or procurement of arms licences in violation of the Arms Act         
	The possible involvement of other officers/soldiers knowingly or unknowingly in a conspiracy; this is being examined to see if provisions of the Army Act have been violated         
	 bull; What connections/linkages have been established that stain the character and military reputation of the military person(s) involved (under the Army Act)         
	 bull; How could the conspiracy (if established) be kept confidential from superior officers in the chain of command (under the Army Act).         
	It would involve questioning more officers and soldiers. But it is too early to say conclusively that there were others involved, said a senior officer in army headquarters.         
	We are also examining the loopholes and finding out how best to plug them and avoid such incidents in future. If there is a felt need to question more officers, that will be done. If there is a suspect, he will be questioned and interrogated, said the source.         
	The expansion of the armys internal investigation comes despite the military intelligence wing being privy to the probe by the Maharashtra anti-terror squad for nearly four-and-a-half months since Purohit was arrested in early November 2008. Six persons were killed in the Malegaon blasts on September 29.         
	Purohit, an intelligence corps officer, was then going through a language course in Panchmarhi. He was alleged to be a member of the Abhinav Bharti, a pro-Hindu, Pune-based outfit that campaigns against what it says is a rampaging Islamic tide.         
	Army sources said the fact-finding exercise is a prelude to a summary of evidence and a general court martial against the officer. Disciplinary action can be taken against the officer if there is enough evidence to establish his involvement in the Hindu chauvinistic group.         
	The sources said the armys own investigation would run concurrently with the ATSs probe.         
	Lt Col Purohit is the first serving army officer to face a terror charge. The case has taken a huge toll on the armys image and, to the embarrassment of India, even the Pakistani media has played it up. What has added to the armys discomfiture is that the case features at a time when the defence establishment has made a case to place lieutenant colonels in a higher grade of pay than they are currently in.         
	Defence minister A.K. Antony has promised them the higher benefit but the file has been tossed around between the defence ministry, the Prime Ministers Office and back to the defence ministry.

	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 24: A 500-strong mob set a police station and several vehicles on fire and ransacked shops in Bolangir today after an engineering student was run over by a police van, reports our special correspondent        
	The violence continued till late evening, even as four platoons of armed police forces were deployed in the town, 300km from here. Situation is still tense, said superintendent of police P.S. Ranpise.        
	Violence started after the death of a third-year engineering student, S. P. Mohanty, who was run over by a police van at Rugudipada Square while returning from his college, Srusti Institute Education, on a motorcycle around 1.30pm. Agitated students  mostly from his college  then blocked NH-201, demanding immediate arrest of the van driver.        
	Soon the students turned violent, ransacking shops and setting two government buses and four trucks on fire. The mob then attacked and set the Town police station and SPs office on fire. The police resorted to lathi-charge to disperse the mob.                                 
	Two students were injured in the police action and shifted to VSS Medical College and Hospital at Burla in Sambalpur.         
	Senior police officers rushed to the spot from Sambalpur with reinforcement and reached late evening.        
	The National Students Union of India has called a Bolangir bandh tomorrow to protest the incident and demanded arrest of the driver and compensation of Rs 10 lakh to the family of the deceased.         
	Family members of the deceased also refused to accept the body, which is in Sadar Hospital, until action was taken against the driver.

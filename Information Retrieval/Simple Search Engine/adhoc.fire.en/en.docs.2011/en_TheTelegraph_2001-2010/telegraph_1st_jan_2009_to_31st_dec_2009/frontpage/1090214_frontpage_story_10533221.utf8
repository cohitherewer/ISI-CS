          NICHOLAS WADE                                              
	New York, Feb. 13: Curing common cold, one of medicines most elusive goals, may now be in the realm of the possible.        
	Researchers have said they had decoded the genomes of the 99 strains of the common cold virus and developed a catalogue of its vulnerabilities.        
	We are now quite certain that we see the Achilles heel and that a very effective treatment for common cold is at hand, said Stephen B. Liggett, an asthma expert at the University of Maryland and co-author of the finding.        
	Besides alleviating the achy, sniffly misery familiar to everyone, a true cold-fighting drug could be a godsend for the 20 million people who suffer from asthma and the millions of others with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The common cold virus, a rhinovirus, is thought to set off half of all asthma attacks.        
	Even so, it might be difficult to kindle the interest of pharmaceutical companies. While the new findings are an interesting piece of science, said Glenn Tillotson, an expert on antiviral drugs at Viropharma in Exton, Pennsylvania, he noted that the typical cost of developing a new drug was now $700 million, with interminable fights with financiers and regulators. Because colds are mostly a minor nuisance, drug developers say, people would not be likely to pay for expensive drugs.         
	Carl Seiden, president of Seiden Pharmaceutical Strategies and a long-time industry analyst and consultant, said industry might be loath to wade in because Relenza and Tamiflu  two drugs that ameliorated flu but did not cure it  were huge commercial disappointments.        
	The industry has also learned in recent years that turning a genetic discovery into a marketable drug is far harder than once thought. Industry hurdles aside, perhaps the biggest reason the common cold has long defied treatment is that the rhinovirus has so many strains and presents a moving target for any drug or vaccine.

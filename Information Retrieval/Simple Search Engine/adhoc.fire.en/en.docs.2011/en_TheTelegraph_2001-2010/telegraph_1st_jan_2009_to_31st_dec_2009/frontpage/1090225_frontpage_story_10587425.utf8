  - Weddings draw deposed king out of Nepal on private visit          J. HEMANTH                      Gyanendra when he came   to Calcutta in 2002                                
	Kathmandu, Feb. 24: Nepals deposed monarch, Gyanendra Shah, will arrive in India as a commoner tomorrow to attend a couple of weddings in Orissa and Rajasthan.        
	This will be his first foreign visit after losing the throne on May 28 last year, when Nepal became a republic.        
	Sources close to the former king told The Telegraph that Gyanendra, accompanied by a large entourage including his family, would spend at least 10 days in India.         
	Within a fortnight of the monarchy being abolished, Gyanendra had moved out of the Narayanhitti Palace, the home of the Shah dynasty for more than two centuries. The government then announced the palace would be converted into a national museum. That happens on Friday when Gyanendra will be in India.        
	The sources said the former king would spend at least two days at a five-star hotel in New Delhi. They said at least nine rooms, including the presidential suite, have been booked, but the hotel neither confirmed nor denied this, citing client confidentiality.        
	Diplomatic circles in New Delhi confirmed the deposed Nepali monarchs impending arrival in the capital but said it was an entirely private visit. Since Gyanendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev is now a private Nepali citizen with no official position, we are not involved with the visit at any level, a source in the external affairs ministry said.        
	Some reports had said arrangements had been made to provide invisible security cover to Gyanendra and his entourage, keeping in mind his stature. The Indian ambassador to Nepal, Rakesh Sood, had met Gyanendra at his private retreat in the Nagarjuna Hill Sanctuary overlooking Kathmandu a few weeks ago.        
	No reason was officially ascribed to the meeting. But sources had indicated it was a meeting preparatory to informal security arrangements that needed to be made when the former king was in India. This could not, however, be confirmed.        
	One of the sources in Kathmandu said: If possible, he will try to meet senior politicians such as BJP leaders L.K. Advani, Jaswant Singh, Rajnath Singh and Narendra Modi and Congress president Sonia Gandhi.        
	The reported move to seek appointments with Indian politicians comes at a time New Delhi is growing increasingly wary of the Maoists, who lead Nepals coalition government.        
	The Maoists, while posturing against India, have been openly flirting with Beijing. Six Chinese delegations have visited Kathmandu in the past six months, prompting New Delhi to send foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon over on an unscheduled visit last week.        
	Menon held long discussions with Maoist chief and Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal alias Prachanda, and conveyed Indias concerns at the growing Chinese activity in Kathmandu.        
	As Gyanendra boards the flight to India, a high-level Chinese foreign ministry team, led by assistant minister Liu Jieyi, will arrive in Kathmandu.

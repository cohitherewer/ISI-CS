The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | People to Ulfa: Spare our road
                                                                                                           People to Ulfa: Spare our road
          RIPUNJOY DAS                       The road after construction was left unfinished                          
	Dibrugarh, Aug. 27: Some parts of the country may be furiously debating Jinnahs role in Partition but a suffering populace in Assam knows what it needs and has summoned the courage to speak its mind.        
	Thousands of villagers have told the dreaded Ulfa to keep off central funds meant to build a road, possibly the first such appeal in militancy-wracked Assam.        
	The villagers of Puroni Sapekhati in Sivasagar district today asked the banned outfit, notorious for its extortion demands, to spare the money.        
	The collective appeal came after Ulfa asked a contractor engaged in constructing the road to pay up Rs 50 lakh, stalling the project in the Upper Assam area.        
	The villagers, who have no direct line of communication with the outfit, formed a committee to voice their appeal, hoping that the invisible eyes and ears of Ulfa would pick up the message. If you desire that we the people of this economically backward area should live in peace, please spare the development funds, one villager said.        
	In the past, too, there have been instances of villagers protesting murders carried out by the group, but this is possibly the first time that they have organised themselves against a threat to stall development.        
	Puroni Sapekhati, which covers around 200 villages, was once a prosperous region but fell behind because of poor communication and transport links. After repeated appeals, the government recently sanctioned Rs 14.14 crore under the Tenth Plan for a road linking the area to Pithaguti in Dibrugarh district.        
	The North Eastern Council was asked to implement the 22km project, but hit a bump when the firm hired to construct a 6km stretch of the road at a cost of Rs 4.23 crore stopped work after the extortion demand.        
	After decades of neglect, when something positive was finally happening, the work had to stop, said Bijoy Gogoi, a member of the villagers committee. We have come to know that the project was stalled because Ulfa demanded money. We appeal to Ulfa to withdraw its demand in the greater interest of the poor people and society.        
	Although Ulfa has weakened in Upper Assam, it still has influence in isolated pockets such as Sapekhati.        
	 We will soon start a signature, poster and banner campaign in the area, appealing to the outfit to withdraw its demand, committee assistant general secretary Keshob Gogoi said.

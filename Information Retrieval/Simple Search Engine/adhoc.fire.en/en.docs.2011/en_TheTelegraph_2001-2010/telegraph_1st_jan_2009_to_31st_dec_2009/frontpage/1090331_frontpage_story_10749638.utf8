The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Exit Varun the storm, enter Sanjay the Second
                                                                                                           Exit Varun the storm, enter Sanjay the Second
  - Blackened slogan and black humour bring out the divide in pilibhit          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                             The slogan in which the words Varun and Sanjay have been blacked out in Pilibhit. Picture by Rajesh Kumar                                         
	Pilibhit, March 30: Varun Gandhis brash hate-mongering in this rural outback came written in by those who scripted his campaign.         
	Its spine is a notorious and malign political legacy that even its one-time partisans are loath to invoke  the ruthless smash-and-grab politics of Sanjay Gandhi, which was also, at the peak of its virulence, deeply anti-Muslim.         
	Varun nahin yeh aandhi hai, doosra Sanjay Gandhi hai is how the BJP debutant, now pinned within Pilibhit jail under a hail of charges including the National Security Act, chose to introduce himself to constituents  this isnt Varun, this is a storm, this is Sanjay Gandhi reborn! Thats the promise tanker loads of wall paint spewed across Pilibhit; Varuns speeches, part of recorded national infamy, only gave the truth to them.         
	Sagheer Ahmed, owner of a jaggery mint near Barkheda, venue of some of Varuns venomous discharge, was never in any doubt. Sanjay ka beta aur kaisi baaten karega? Isne to sirf hamare haath kaatne ki baat kee hai, baap ne to jabran nasbandi hi kara di thee (What else will the son of Sanjay (Gandhi) say? The boy has only threatened to cut off our hands, his father had forced sterilisation on us.)         
	On the walls of an abandoned mill behind Ahmed flared that ubiquitous signature slogan of Varun embossed with the BJPs symbol someone had blackened the Varun and the Sanjay on it and lavished the lotus with an angry cross.         
	Village youngsters huddled around the wizened Sagheer would not claim responsibility but they leave you in little doubt it could have been one of them. Varun Gandhi ke haath ka diya thodi khate hain jo hamare haath kaat lega? one of them protests. Aur kaat lega to desh mein baaki log mar gaye hain kya? (We dont eat out of Varuns hands that he is free to cut ours off, and even if he does, is there nobody left in this country to oppose him?)         
	On paper, and for reasons of law, Varun has been calling the taped CDs of his speeches a fabrication, but, cleverly, he has not involved himself in any specific denials of his hate speech. His later statements have been subtler, like smooth polish on raw toxin  What I said was in the interest of my society, and I am ready to go to jail if that gives strength to those who believe in what I said.         
	It has worked where it was intended to, as Saturdays shrill upsurge around the Pilibhit courthouse suggested.         
	Even this morning, as Pilibhit awaited the verdict, the divide to this side and that of Varun was making itself evident everywhere. At the courts itself, a Muslim lawyer was lightly mocked by a clutch of colleagues for wearing a beard: Kaat lo mian, kaat lo, Varun ka raaj aane wala hai (Cut it off, its going to be Varun-raj now).         
	They were only joking, but there was no mistaking the menace of their undertone. The object of the taunt held his ground a while, then quietly slipped away into the kutcherry.         
	All day, Varuns battery of lawyers and sympathisers  aunt Ambica Shukla included  argued their case behind the iron-gated Pilibhit jail, now protesting innocence over contents of the doctored CDs, now expressing outrage at a poor boy being slapped with National Security Act provisions.         
	Unlike Varuns Saturday appearance in the district court, which exploded into an uncontrollable protest by the BJP rank and file, today was a security show that kept all rumpus at bay.         
	Entry to Pilibhit town was strictly regulated. The Civil Lines area, where both the jail and the court lie, lay fortified behind several layers of protection  the Rapid Action Force, special force units and local police. Even so, the hearing was held not in the court, where media cameras lay arrayed like beached sharks, but within the jail.         
	Late evening, Varun did get relief in the inflammatory speeches cases by fulfilling two Rs 20,000 bonds, but the National Security Act provisions kept him behind the Pilibhit bars, his lawyers struggling to extract Varun from his legal tangles.         
	Varuns lawyer Dhirendra Mishra, downcast despite his claim of victory, said his client could spend a minimum of three more weeks in jail because of the stringent provisions of the act.         
	Utterly exaggerated, said Shukla, quoting sister Maneka Gandhi, who arrived late in the evening from Delhi to visit her interned son. The NSA case is nothing but a cheap political conspiracy. The BSP and the Congress are in a race to secure Muslim votes by punishing an innocent and brave young man. Whatever he did, he only spoke the truth.         
	That truth is a gaping divide that may wreak fractures far beyond Pilibhit and offer his party the rewards of a bitter harvest. Not for nothing are BJP leaders across the country competing to defend Varun in the face of palpable guilt and piquant paradox.         
	Joining the chorus of outrage from Ranchi, BJP spearhead L.K. Advani likened the imposition of the National Security Act on Varun Gandhi to the dark deeds of the Emergency, pitifully non-cognizant of the irony of his plea  the avowed hero of the man he had risen to shield was the greatest villain of the Emergency Advani was so eloquently berating.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Dona lets cat out of SP bag
                                                                                                           Dona lets cat out of SP bag
  - Party wants Sourav to contest, says wife          PTI AND OUR BUREAU                            Dona performs in Allahabad on Monday. (PTI)                                        
	Feb. 17: Dona Ganguly can not only dance, she knows her political alphabets too.        
	Not a mean task, considering how parties split themselves like amoeba and have monopolised every conceivable abbreviation.        
	The Odissi artiste today said in Allahabad a leader from the Samajwadi Party had approached her with an offer of a poll ticket for her husband Sourav Ganguly when she had gone to attend a dance programme in Lucknow on Sunday.        
	Dona, who was in Allahabad for a cultural fest, first said a minister had told her he (Sourav) should come and fight from UP but she wasnt sure if it was the ruling BSP that had made the offer.        
	Such offers keep coming but Sourav has not yet decided, she said.        
	Then, after a brief pause, she added that it was most probably a Samajwadi Party leader.        
	I dont remember, I think Samajwadi Party, although I may be wrong. Since I am not into politics, I dont exactly know the names of people in politics. But I think it was SP.        
	In Delhi, Samajwadi general secretary Amar Singh gave away little.         
	Nobody from our side has officially gone to Dona Ganguly. If someone went on our behalf, I dont know about it, PTI quoted him as saying. But if Sourav Ganguly wants to join the SP, we will consider ourselves lucky.        
	Samajwadi sources in Uttar Pradesh, however, revealed that an MLA close to Amar had indeed approached Dona and that the party had been thinking of fielding the former cricket captain from Varanasi, which has a large Bengali population.        
	Had there been any positive response from Sourav, Amar Singh himself would have approached him. But the response from Dona was not something to go about it positively now, a party source said.        
	In Calcutta, Sourav rubbished suggestions that he would contest elections in the near future.         
	Told that Dona had been quoted as saying that a Samajwadi leader had approached her, he said: My wife cant say such things. The news is absolutely false.        
	He added: I am not contesting any elections from anywhere in the country. I am simply not good enough for politics. And, moreover why would go to any other state when I have my own.        
	It isnt clear whether Sourav  who recently retired from international cricket but heads the Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League  was alluding to the CPM, but there have been rumours that Bengals ruling Marxists want him to contest as a party candidate.        
	Dona, too, said as much today in Allahabad when she told PTI the Bengal government definitely wants that he (Sourav) should step into politics.        
	But she added that Sourav had no plans to contest elections now. If he has to do it, he will do it in West Bengal, not from Uttar Pradesh, she was quoted as telling TV channels.         
	Dona, apparently, is not averse to Sourav joining politics. Personally, I feel he is a good leader but its his decision as to what he will do, she said in reply to a question.        
	Sourav has always believed in nurturing emerging talent. He wishes to continue this work by opening a cricket academy, Dona said.         
	Her husband, she added, planned to open a chain of schools, affiliated to a reputable board.

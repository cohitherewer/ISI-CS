The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Indian broke Jackson news with Twitter help
                                                                                                           Indian broke Jackson news with Twitter help
          NOAM COHEN                            Ahead of papers                                  
	New York, July 14: Like a research scientist who gets a chance to play with a chemistry set, Sreenath Sreenivasan, a new-media professor at the Columbia Journalism School, returned to the roots of his chosen field last month riding home on a New York train.        
	It was 5:54pm and he was being overwhelmed with messages from people he follows on Twitter saying that Michael Jackson was dead. He gasped at the news, announced it to his fellow riders, and they all gasped too. This is Sree Sreenivasan reporting live from beneath the busy streets of Manhattan.         
	So, how good was his sourcing?        
	I knew he was in the hospital, he said in an interview. And by then, so many people who I trusted were tweeting about it. But, of course, they were all quoting the same source.        
	That source was TMZ, the celebrity gossip site owned by Time Warner with a reputation as both salacious and accurate. As early as 5:20pm, TMZ was reporting that Jackson had died. When Sreenivasan emerged from the subway and switched among the three cable news networks, he realised he had had much looser sourcing standards than many of the nations largest news outlets.         
	They were still reporting that Jackson was in a coma, he said, with no mention that the Internet was buzzing with the news that the King of Pop was dead. If I had been in fact wrong, it would not have been good, he said.        
	Sreenivasan later posted to Facebook a screenshot of the news alerts he was sent that evening. It shows that, finally, at 6:23pm, The Los Angeles Times reported that Michael Jackson was dead.         
	Not surprisingly, Sreenivasan doesnt regularly visit TMZ, though he considers it very reliable on celebrity news.         
	Everyone imagines TMZ does not care, but if they had got it wrong, it would have been bad  sites like TMZ make or break their futures on this kind of story, he said.                             NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

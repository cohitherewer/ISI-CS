The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Before ID, a big adieu 
                                                                                                           Before ID, a big adieu 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Nilekani                                  
	Bangalore, July 9: The daily drive down Bangalores notoriously busy Hosur Road, then logging into the network of the company he helped build and checking mail  it all became a thing of the past for Nandan Nilekani today.        
	The Infosys Technologies Ltd co-chairman bid adieu to the software company to a standing ovation from a packed hall of Infoscions, as the employees like to call themselves.        
	Nilekani, 54, will go on to head the Unique Identification Authority of India  the worlds largest biometric ID card project planned by the Indian government  as its chairman, a cabinet-rank post.        
	Today, however, it was a journey back through 28 eventful years, the event from the companys convention hall beamed live across its intranet for employees across the globe. It was the biggest sendoff at Infosys.        
	It was a very emotional farewell. He was overwhelmed, said an employee, describing the sendoff this evening by staff and company brass.        
	Nilekanis mother Durga, wife Rohini and children Jhanvi and Nihar were at the farewell that saw each of the founder members recount the years spent at the firm they started in 1981. We got to see all their families on stage. That was a big thing for most of us, an employee said.        
	Another said that what struck her most about Nilekani was that he remembered her name some two months after she was introduced to him. He never forgets an employees name, she said.        
	It has been a very busy week for Nilekani, who resigned on June 25, with lots of mail coming from employees and with people meeting him at his cabin, which is filled with awards and honours and a few pictures.

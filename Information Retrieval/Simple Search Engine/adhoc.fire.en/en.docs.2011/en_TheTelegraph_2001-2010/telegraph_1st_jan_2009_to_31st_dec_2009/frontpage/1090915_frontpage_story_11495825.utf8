The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Aarushi phone found on UP bank employee
                                                                                                           Aarushi phone found on UP bank employee
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                      Aarushi                          
	New Delhi, Sept. 14: Delhi polices crime branch today claimed to have found the missing cellphone of Aarushi Talwar, the 15-year-old schoolgirl murdered at her Noida home on May 15 last year, and declared it a crucial clue.        
	The CBI, which has been investigating the murder, had been claiming the killer had broken the cellphone and disposed of it. Delhi police, however, said they had tracked the N-series handset from its IMEI number and seized it from a bank employee in Khurza town of Bulandshahr, western Uttar Pradesh.        
	Delhi police have detained bank employee Ramachandra, a man in his late 40s, who will be produced before a Bulandshahr court tomorrow. Ramachandra has allegedly claimed he found the phone lying on a roadside in May 2008 and had been using it since January 7 this year.        
	Sources, however, said Ramachandras sister had been a maid in Noida and may have passed the mobile on to him. They said the phone was believed to contain photographs taken till the last moments before Aarushis death.        
	They said the clips and call details would be crucial to solving the case, which has proved intractable, especially because of the CBIs failure to find the murder weapon, or even the mobile of Aarushis servant Hemraj who was killed the same night.        
	However, the discovery leaves many questions unanswered in a case riddled with missing clues, investigative goof-ups and wrong arrests. Delhi police did not explain why they had begun tracking the phone over a year after the murder in a case they were never involved with.        
	Nor would the CBI explain its failure to track a phone operational less than 50km from Delhi. Its spokesman refused comment even on the crime branch seizure. Police officers said the mobile had been handed over to the CBI.         
	Aarushis father, dentist Rajesh Talwar  earlier wrongly arrested by Noida police in the case  said: Im thankful to God that this breakthrough has happened. My daughter will at last get justice.        
	Last week, the latest goof-up charge in the case came when the central forensic laboratory in Hyderabad said the purported vaginal swab of Aarushi sent to it was not hers. It said it had informed the CBI about this months ago.         
	The CBI hasnt been able to file a charge-sheet against the accused  Rajeshs compounder Krishna and his alleged accomplices Rajkumar and Vijay Mandal  who are on bail. CBI joint director Arun Kumar, who headed the probe, left the agency for his parent cadre this month.

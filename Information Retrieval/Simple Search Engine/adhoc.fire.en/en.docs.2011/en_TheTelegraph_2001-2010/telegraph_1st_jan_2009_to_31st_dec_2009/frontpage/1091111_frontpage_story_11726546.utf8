	Los Angeles, Nov. 10 (Reuters): A judge yesterday blocked singer-actress Jennifer Lopezs first husband from distributing a tell-all movie with video of the former couples sex life.        
	But Ojani Noa, a chef and model who was married to Lopez for less than 11 months, said he would fight back.        
	Los Angeles Superior Court judge James Chalfants order to Lopezs former husband will remain in effect until a court hearing to determine whether to extend it.        
	In her lawsuit, Lopez said Noa was trying to sell a movie with footage of the couple in sexual situations, including their time in a hotel room in 1997. She is seeking $10 million in damages.

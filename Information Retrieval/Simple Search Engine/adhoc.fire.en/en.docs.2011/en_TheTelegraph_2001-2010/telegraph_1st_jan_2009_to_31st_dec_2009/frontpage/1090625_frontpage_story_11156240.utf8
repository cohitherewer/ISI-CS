                                                                                                             Guns, at every twist amp; turn
  Forces aplenty, room scarce          SUJAN DUTTA                            Civilians and gun-toting security forces go about their business in Lalgarh on Wednesday. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                        
	Goaltore, June 24: A nearly finished building for a 100-bed hospital at Kewakole on the road to this town will get its first occupants shortly  they will not be doctors, nurses or patients but uniformed security personnel with guns and bullets.        
	The Bengal government is deploying so many forces in its offensive in Lalgarh that there isnt enough room to house them. Even a hospital  there is only a primary health centre in Kewakole with the bare minimum in facilities  is now designated as a camp for security personnel who are on their way here. Every school and college in Goaltore has been requisitioned.        
	There is too much firepower in too small an area. Police walk into shops with guns and ask for food, they talk to people with guns slinging from their shoulders. They talk about guns and forces. The chatter intimidates the villagers. It is like living in a militarised zone, not unlike scenes in Nagaland and Manipur and Kashmir.        
	Even if the army is not here, there uniforms are  so many of the state and central forces wear the army-issue fatigues that they are difficult to distinguish from the military. The forces have the bearing of the army but do not have its training.        
	Bengals Lalgarh offensive has already taken in 5,000 troops. The figure has not been announced officially. A senior security officer told The Telegraph today that the combined forces of the state and the Centre total 50 companies. There are another 10 companies of central forces coming in.        
	The operations are designed to sweep through 200 villages, with 100 in a core area. The official suggested using Kantapahari, the village on the south-to-north road from Lalgarh to Ramgarh that the forces have not entered as yet  as the centre of the region.        
	It will take time. There is no hurry. Our strategy is to clear-and-hold, clear-and-hold, he said. There is no point in simply going ahead without consolidation or we may land into a trap because the Maoists know the area well. We need to round up their ringleaders. So, normal policing activity has to be started in the areas we are holding, he said.        
	Since the offensive began, the forces have only gone down an east-west axis to Lalgarh police station.        
	The forces will ultimately seek to secure about 500sqkm of territory inside which the villages are spread out. There are jungles and four roads like fingers that lead to Lalgarh.        
	The eastern periphery of this region is the road that runs from Midnapore through Salboni to Goaltore and up to Sarenga in Bankura district. The security forces are now pouring into Goaltore in a build-up for an offensive through Pingboni where the Bengal armed police were stopped by rebels last Saturday.        
	A total of 5,000 security personnel in an area of 500sqkm means an average of 10 police personnel per square km. The security forces have not yet been able to spread out.        
	With the Maoist rebels displaying that they are capable of putting up a fight  like they did in Pingboni where even today the police are not venturing  Lalgarhs offensive and the build-up is putting thousands of lives at risk despite the delicate handling that Writers Buildings has ordered.        
	The presence of the troops here pleases nobody, including the police themselves. I was posted in Birbhum, says a Bengal Armed Police constable carrying a .303 rifle with him into a little roadside eatery for a lunch of rice and dal.        
	He is camping, he says, in the Goaltore Boys High School. There are 50 of us in a room and the ceiling fan hardly moves. I am on guard duty from 8 in the morning till 3 and its bloody hot.        
	He asks for vegetables to go with the rice and dal. There is none available in the eatery. The central forces move with their cooks and provisions. We have been sent here without any arrangements. Thank God for this shop here, I havent gone hungry the last three days, he says. He left Birbhum eight days ago.        
	Three more soldiers walk into the eatery. They are from the India Reserve Battalion. Each of them is carrying an AK-47. The armed police constables .303 weighs 7 kilos. One of the IRB troopers says his weapon weighs exactly 4 kilos and 700 grams and can fire 30 bullets in a second. The constable says he will take 10 seconds to fire 10 rounds because he has to pull the catch back every time.        
	In the eatery are four other people  the owner, the cook, the helper and a customer. They are agog, listening to this chatter about guns and bullets. The customer trudged from Babuibasha, a village about 4km from Goaltore past a forest. He forgets to chew his food.        
	He talks after the police have left. He said people in his village  in a zone that the police have not yet gone  were terrified. He does not talk of the police. In village after village here, the local people call the security forces by a different name  shontrash bahini  repressive force.

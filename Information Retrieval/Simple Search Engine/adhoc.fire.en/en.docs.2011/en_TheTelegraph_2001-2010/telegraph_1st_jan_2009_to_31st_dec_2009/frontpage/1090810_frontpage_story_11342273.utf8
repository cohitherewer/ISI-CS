The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Lashkar ousts English team 
                                                                                                           Lashkar ousts English team 
          AMIT ROY                               
	London, Aug. 9: The England team has pulled out of the World Badminton Championships in Hyderabad on the basis of a report on a terror threat but the foreign office in London appeared not to be entirely happy with the decision.        
	Nevertheless, questions were also being raised in London today about Indian competence in securing next years Commonwealth Games in Delhi. British politicians were shuttling back and forth between studios, despite Sunday being a day for leisurely lunches, giving interviews.        
	The decision to withdraw from the world championships was entirely Badminton Englands, emphasised a statement from the foreign office in London.        
	It is the curious use of the word entirely which suggests that the foreign office and the British high commission in Delhi, while giving advice to the English players and officials, would have been happier if the team had stayed.        
	The foreign office statement said: They took this decision based on their own assessment of the situation on the ground, having taken into account the FCO Travel Advice warning of a high threat from terrorism in parts of India, including Hyderabad. The British high commission had been in close contact with the Indian authorities which gave assurances that the highest level of security was in place around the Badminton world championships.        
	The use of the phrase own assessment also indicates that in the view of British diplomats, the England team may have overreacted to media reports of an Indian home ministry advisory on the terror threat from the Lashkar-e-Toiba to Hyderabad, Calcutta and Delhi in the run-up to Independence Day.        
	William Kings, press officer for Badminton England, said the players and officials initially thought the reports might have been exaggerated. But after visiting the facilities, they were not reassured.        
	Security was increased but it seems this happened too late as far as the England team was concerned. What would probably have preyed on the teams minds was the attack on the Sri Lankan cricketers in Lahore in March.        
	Questions will now be raised about the Commonwealth Games in Delhi next year. British sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe told Sky News Sunday Live: Clearly weve got the Commonwealth Games in India next year, and we dont want to see major sporting events affected in this way..        
	Sutcliffe appeared to contradict his own foreign office  not unusual in Gordon Browns government  when he told the BBC he supported the decision to pull out. You have to support them because the players security has to come first. He said he would be speaking to the Indian authorities to find out what happened, and to see what Britain could do to help.

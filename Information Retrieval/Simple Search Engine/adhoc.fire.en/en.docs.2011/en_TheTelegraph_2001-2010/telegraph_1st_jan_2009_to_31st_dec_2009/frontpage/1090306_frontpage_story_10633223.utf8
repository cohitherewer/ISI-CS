The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | President questions validity of doctorates

  - Jolt to Jamia varsity after mistake          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                                     Pratibha Patil, Naseeruddin Shah, Shabana Azmi                                        
	New Delhi, March 5: President Pratibha Patil has challenged the validity of honorary doctorates awarded by Jamia Millia Islamia last year to actors Shabana Azmi and Naseeruddin Shah and others, accusing the university of violating rules.         
	The Presidents office has returned the universitys plea for post-facto recognition to the degrees, asking why Patil  the Visitor to central universities  was ignored earlier, government officials have said.         
	Without the Presidents approval, the degrees have no official sanctity.         
	The Presidents refusal to unquestioningly rubber-stamp a process where her prior approval is required has left the human resource development ministry red-faced and struggling for explanations to offer to the highest office of the land.         
	The ministry is responsible for Jamia, a central university, and the Presidents office has asked it to explain why rules were violated in granting the degrees.         
	Jamia vice-chancellor Mushirul Hasan is currently abroad and could not be reached on his phone.         
	Two senior officers, however, independently confirmed to The Telegraph that the Presidents charges were accurate but claimed the controversy was the result of an honest error.         
	The Presidents office, in its note to the HRD ministry last week, has cited statute 29(1) of the rules that accompany the Jamia Millia Islamia act governing the university.         
	The statute allows the university executive council to recommend names of eminent personalities that Jamia wishes to grant honoris causa (Latin for honorary) degrees.         
	But the councils recommendation must be approved by the Visitor  the President of India  before the degrees can be awarded. All central academic institutions need to follow the same process.         
	Jamia, however, had awarded the degrees at its convocation on October 31 last year without even seeking the Presidents approval.         
	Besides Shabana and Naseeruddin, the university honoured art scholar Kapila Vatsyayan and Asghar Ali Engineer, a Muslim scholar known for his work on liberation theology in Islam.         
	Jamia sought the consent only in January, Patils office has said in its note.         
	The HRD ministry and Jamia, sources said, are keen to avoid a scenario where they have to ask the awardees to return the honours. That would be a public embarrassment that will leave a stain which would be hard to remove for several years, a Jamia official said.         
	But not paying heed to the Presidents concerns is not an option.         
	The HRD ministry, sources said, plans to write to the Presidents office saying that the breach of rules was an inadvertent lapse on the part of Jamia.         
	It will request the President to pardon Jamia and recognise the degrees that, officials admit, would otherwise remain invalid.         
	Top academic institutions, including central universities and even the Indian Institutes of Technology, are increasingly queuing up to grant honorary degrees at their convocation ceremonies, ministry officials said.         
	Former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam has received over 30 honorary doctorates and possibly tops the list of Indians with the highest number of such degrees.         
	Atomic energy chief Anil Kakodkars popularity for the degrees peaked after the Indo-US nuclear deal.         
	At least two IITs  in Mumbai and Kharagpur  have awarded industrialist Ratan Tata honorary degrees.         
	Actor Amitabh Bachchan was awarded an honorary doctorate in 2006 by his alma mater, Delhi University.

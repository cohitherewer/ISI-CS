The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Queries usher in Nano bookings
                                                                                                           Queries usher in Nano bookings
          OUR BUREAU                             Shyamaprasad Aich: Revenge buy                                  
	April 9: Bookings for the Nano opened today amid confusing signals from the Tatas over the conduct of the computer-generated lottery in July.         
	The Tata Nano website put out conditions for the bookings that specifically barred multiple applications by an individual. However, Tata Motors Finance  the auto financing arm within the group  said there would be no limit on the number of bookings that an applicant could make.         
	The Tata Motors spokesperson saw no confusion between the apparently contradictory positions. There is no upper limit on how many applications an individual can make. But we reserve the right to weed out multiple applications, he said, without asserting that they would do so.         
	If Tata Motors intended to weed out multiple applications eventually, why was it permitting Tata Motors Finance to accept multiple applications in the first place? It is fairly easy to weed out applications since the bookings have to be supported by PAN card identification.         
	Yes, multiple applications will increase your chances of winning an allotment, said another official. The computerised pseudo-random number generation technique will select 100,000 allottees.         
	Even more intriguing was a proviso in the booking terms spelt out on the Nano website which said Tata Motors would have the right to sell 10 per cent of the Nano production at its discretion and outside the lottery process.         
	The car is now being produced at the companys Pantnagar plant, which has a capacity to produce 4,000 units a month. Tata Motors is setting up a larger production plant at Sanand in Gujarat, which will have the capacity to roll out 2.5 lakh units a year. This plant is expected to be ready by December or early 2010.         
	But the slight confusion over the booking rules didnt dim the excitement at Tata Motors dealerships across the metros and towns. Many were paying the full booking amount of Rs 95,000 for the base model instead of seeking financial assistance.         
	Retired central government employee Shyamaprasad Aich from Bijoygarh arrived early at KB Motors on Ballygunge Circular Road to submit his application form. He was one of the few to make an outright payment of Rs 1,40,000 to book the top-end LX variant.         
	My wife died on March 27. She had wanted a Nano very badly and would have seen one in her lifetime if Mamata hadnt forced the delay. I want to buy one to pay my respects to her. I am booking the Nano to give Mamata a fitting reply.         
	The Tata channel partners were resorting to a bit of hard sell to get customers to book the car. At the Westside store on Camac Street, Club West members were being given gift vouchers worth Rs 300 to cover the cost of the form.         
	Argentinian tourist Alexandro Vincent popped into Lexus Motors on AJC Bose Road to gaze at the worlds cheapest car. Vincent was amazed at the build quality of the $2,000 car. Will he buy the Nano Europa back home? I just might consider that, he said.         
	Lucknow was one of the centres that witnessed heavy bookings  about 7,000 on the first day. Filmmaker Muzzafar Ali, who directed the film Umrao Jaan , was among the early applicants. Dealerships in Delhi, Mumbai, Ranchi and Jamshedpur reported bookings in hundreds. Most expect bookings to surge before the window slams shut on April 25.         
	Many customers were disappointed they couldnt test-drive the car. Our dealers are unable to give out the car for test drives because of the numbers, said the Tata Motors spokesperson. Most dealers have been given just one car for display.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Found: a hot and firm place to stand on 
                                                                                                           Found: a hot and firm place to stand on 
                                An artists impression of the planet called Corot-7b. (AP)                            
	Washington, Sept. 16 (AP): Astronomers have finally found a place outside our solar system where there is a firm place to stand  if only it were not so boiling hot.        
	As scientists search the skies for life elsewhere, they have found more than 300 planets outside our solar system. But they all have been gas balls or cant be proven to be solid. Now a team of European astronomers has confirmed the first rocky extrasolar planet.        
	Scientists have long figured that if life begins on a planet, it needs a solid surface to rest on, so finding one elsewhere is a big deal. We basically live on a rock ourselves, said co-discoverer Artie Hatzes, director of the Thuringer observatory in Germany. Its as close to something like the Earth that weve found so far. Its just a little too close to its sun.        
	So close that its surface temperature is more than 2,000 degrees Celsius, too toasty to sustain life. It circles its star in just 20 hours, zipping around at 750,000kmph. By comparison, Mercury, the planet nearest our sun, completes its solar orbit in 88 days.        
	This is a major discovery in the field of trying to find life elsewhere in the universe, said outside expert Alan Boss of the Carnegie Institution. The planet, called Corot-7b, was the buzz of a conference on finding an Earth-like rock outside our solar system held in Barcelona where the discovery was presented yesterday.

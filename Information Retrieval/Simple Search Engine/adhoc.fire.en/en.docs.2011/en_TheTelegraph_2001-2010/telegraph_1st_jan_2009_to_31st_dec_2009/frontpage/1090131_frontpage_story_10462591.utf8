                                                                                                           Maoists charged in monk murder
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 30: A preliminary chargesheet was filed in the Swami Laxmananda Saraswati murder case at a Kandhamal court today, in which CID reiterated its claim that a group of Maoists were involved in the crime.        
	According to the chargesheet, a group of assailants  armed with AK-47 and Insas rifles attacked the Jalespeta ashram during Janmasthami celebrations on August 23 and gunned down the 82-year-old monk. They also killed Kishore Baba (45), Amritananda Baba (62), Mata Bhaktimayee (40), all of them ashram inmates, and Puranjan Ganthi (28), brother of one of the girl inmates of the tribal residential school. However, the conspiracy to eliminate the Swamiji had been hatched in December 2007, said CID sources. We are looking for 150 more people. Investigations will continue and we may file a final chargesheet, said a senior CID official.         
	Crime branch SP Yatindra Koyal said the Maoist hand was clear from the evidence. Asked whether there was involvement of any hardcore Maoists, he said: This is a preliminary chargesheet. The case is open. More facts will come out in the course of further investigation and trials.        
	Todays was the first chargesheet filed by the CID, which took over investigations five days after the murder, that triggered large-scale violence, claiming more than 40 lives, mostly belonging to the Christian community.        
	Seven accused, arrested earlier, were named in the 270-page chargesheet filed in the court of Baliguda sub-divisional judicial magistrate, Dolagobinda Barik, this afternoon. Duryodhan Sunamajhi, Munda Badamajhi, Sanatana Badamajhi, Bijay Sanseth, Gananath Chalanseth, Bhaskar Sunamajhi and Buddhadev Naik have been charged under Sections 302, 449, 380, 120(B) and 34 of the IPC and Sections 25 and 27 of the Arms Act. Naik is a hardcore Maoist, while others were active sympathisers of the outfit, said crime branch sources. Masks, black shirts and weapons had been recovered from the accused at the time of the arrest.        
	Yesterday, CID charged 10 persons in the Kandhamal nun rape case.        
	Though the police have been harping on the Maoist hand with a prominent rebel leader claiming responsibility for the Swamis death, Hindu organisations do not buy it, blaming Christians instead.        
	Stating that the seven arrested accused were not the prime accused, Hindu outfits have been demanding the arrest of the real conspirators and the real perpetrators of the crime.

	Ranchi/Jamshedpur, Nov. 29: In a violent prelude to the second phase of polling, Maoists killed three, blew up five school buildings and damaged railway tracks across East Singhbhum, Palamau, Simdega and Bokaro to mark the first day of their 48-hour bandh in the state.        
	The shutdown also halted most candidates in their campaign tracks, allowing only those with access to choppers to reach out to the masses.         
	The first target of the bandh  called to press for fair trial of CPI(Maoist) South Chhotanagpur Zonal Committee leader Ashok Mahto allegedly being kept at an undisclosed location since his arrest on October 23  were five village schools at Hariharganj and Pipra in Palamau, some 240km from the capital. Superintendent of police (SP) Jatin Narwal said the rebels used dynamites to raze the buildings much before the bandh came into effect.         
	In Bokaro, Howrah-Jabalpur Shaktipunj Express had a close shave as another squad of rebels blew up tracks between Jogeshwar Vihar and Dania stations minutes after the train passed at 10.45pm. Bokaro SP Saket Kumar Singh said the blast damaged a metre of tracks and disrupted traffic in the CIC section of Dhanbad railway division for over 12 hours. Traffic resumed only at 11am today.        
	A second attack on railway property took place at Mahabuang village near Bono station, 50km from Ranchi, in Simdega district. Maoists triggered twin blasts, damaging tracks and a portion of the stationmasters office, at 1.40am. SP Abhisekh Kumar said a two-metre crack delayed the Puri-Hatia Tapaswini Express, scheduled to cross Bono around 6am, by three hours. Movement of train could be restored only at 9am, he said.         
	The Maoist-sponsored bandh took a gory turn in East Singhbhum, where a pressure bomb meant for security forces killed three villagers and injured seven at Sesangdih in Patamda, 55km from Jamshedpur, this morning.        
	Judhistir Mahto, one of the victims under treatment at Tata Main Hospital, said the IED went off when CRPF jawans, on an anti-poster drive, asked them to remove a felled tree that was blocking the road. We were playing football when they asked for help. As we lifted the tree, there was a loud bang, Mahto said.        
	East Singhbhum SP Naveen Kumar Singh confirmed the use of IED and said two villagers died on the spot while a third on his way to hospital.        
	Singh said police and paramilitary personnel had intensified patrolling in Patamda.         
	Senior BJP leader and Jamshedpur MP Arjun Munda accused the police of lack of concern. He claimed that they were not forthcoming in providing relief to the injured villagers. JMM leader and the partys candidate from Jugsalai Dulal Bhuiyan and his RJD rival Sharda Devi also met the victims.        
	Police spokesperson V.H. Deshmukh termed the bandh a ploy to kill innocents and disrupt polling. We are not confining any Maoist leader. The bandh has been called to infuse fear before the polls, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Cong lines up stars, BJP low-key
                                                                                                           Cong lines up stars, BJP low-key
  - Today: Rahul to canvass for school friend          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                                    
	Ranchi, March 31: Campaigning is set to shift to high gear in Jharkhand with the Congress lining up the likes of Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi, while the BJP is sticking to a low-key approach, having so far fielded the tried and tested L.K. Advani only.        
	Rahul Gandhi is coming in tomorrow to address two rallies  one for his school friend Saurabh Narayan Singh, who is contesting from Ramgarh, and another from Rameshwar Oraon, the party nominee from Lohardaga.        
	Saurabh, a scion of the Ramgarh princely estate and MLA from Hazaribagh, studied with Rahul in Modern School, New Delhi, and later in Doon School.         
	The BJPs star of the day tomorrow will be Hema Malini, who will campaign for Karia Munda in Kharsawan and address rallies in Giridih and Koderma. She will be our only star campaigner and that too for a single day, a party campaign manager said.        
	According to Congress spokesman Ravindra Singh, all party candidates of Jharkhand have sought a time-slot from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Rahul and Sonia, who will be campaigning in the state on April 9 at Khunti and Chatra. She will also be going to Chaibasa in support of party veteran Bagun Sumbrui who is contesting against former chief minister Madhu Koda, who headed a government supported by her for two and-a-half years.         
	The next day, Delhi chief minister Sheila Dixit will be campaigning in Hazaribagh, Koderma, Khunti and Ranchi. We are also seeking dates from Ghulam Nabi Azad, Sriprakash Jaiswal, Oscar Fernandes, Digvijay Singh, Rashid Alvi, Ajit Jogi, former Team India captain Md Azharuddin, Shah Rukh Khan, Preity Zinta, Raj Babbar, Asrani, Govinda, comedian Raju Srivastava and Nagma, Ravindra added.        
	The BJP, on the other hand, isnt banking on stars. Apparently stung by its rout in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, the party is studiously avoiding plans like last years carpet bombing of the state with leaders holding as many as 100 election meetings a day.        
	No wonder last years huge rush of star campaigners, talking about India shining, is missing this time. No leader is seeking out star campaigners. Roadshows are also few and far between. A state BJP leader pointed out the only leaders in demand are Narendra Modi and Sushma Swaraj. The partys shadow prime minister L.K. Advani has already held four election meetings in Jharkhand  one each in Jamshedpur, Simdega, Lohardaga and Dhanbad.                          
	According to sources, the BJPs star campaigner, Shatrughan Sinha, is understood to have rung up Yashwant Sinha offering to campaign for him in Hazaribagh. But the former external affairs minister, who lost in the last election, is said to have cold-shouldered the offer.        
	Former chief minister Arjun Munda, contesting from Jamshedpur, said that they were banking on door-to-door campaigns with a personal touch. We have constituted a booth committee of 10 party workers in each polling station, creating an army of 17,000 booth workers. We have a database of these partymen and since all of them have cellphones, we get across to them through SMS, explained state party spokesman Sanjay Seth.        
	Star campaigners, he maintained, were a distraction. We have to pull out our workers from remote areas to make these programmes successful. Then, it takes a lot of time to send them back to their posts, admitted a state leader.

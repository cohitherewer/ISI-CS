                                                                                                           Raj Modi wife, son take bail
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 11: Sujata Modi, wife of jailed Vedic Village promoter Raj K. Modi, and their son Uday today surrendered in court in connection with a 2005 case.        
	They, along with Raj Modi and other board members of a residential project off Rajarhat, had been charged with converting 21 acres of wetland without permission.        
	Mother and son, along with a relative, Nandalal Modi, were granted bail by the additional chief judicial magistrate of Baruipur court in South 24-Parganas.        
	Following the arrest of Raj Modi in the Vedic Village case, a warrant was set to be issued against his wife and son in the pending case. To pre-empt arrest, the Modis decided to surrender and seek bail, said the familys legal adviser.        
	A case had been registered against 20 members of the Sanjeevani Tower project, near the Aquatica water-park. All of them had been absconding till Raj Modi was arrested on August 29 and three other Modis showed up in court today.

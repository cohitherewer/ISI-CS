The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Koda dodges vigilance again
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Koda dodges vigilance again
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranchi, Nov. 27: Former chief minister Madhu Koda did not keep his date with the state vigilance today, explaining in a letter that he was busy campaigning.         
	The vigilance bureau, which has now asked him to appear at its Audrey House headquarters on December 4, was understandably not pleased with the way the former chief minister has been dodging investigators in connection with the July 2 FIR against him and three former cabinet colleagues for owning assets disproportionate to his known sources of income.        
	This afternoon, Koda sent over an emissary at Audrey House to deliver a letter to the IG vigilance, M.V. Rao, saying he was busy campaigning in Chaibasa for party nominees that included his wife, Geeta.        
	The vigilance bureau, sources said, had taken a serious view of Kodas absence today. They pointed out the former chief minister had earlier this month dodged both the income tax and enforcement directorate officials on the same pretext.                                       
	Investigations cannot be impeded merely because an accused is busy, a senior vigilance officer said.                          
	While the income tax department is engaged in unearthing Kodas hidden incomes and assets, the enforcement directorate has lodged an FIR against him and others under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.         
	Rao confirmed to The Telegraph that fresh summons had been issued to interrogate the former chief minister.        
	To speed up investigations, the sources added, the vigilance bureau would be seeking the help of the income tax department to try and establish a link between various assets and documents unearthed during the joint IT and ED raids on Kodas associates _ Vinod Sinha, Sanjay Choudhary and Mumbai-based hawala dealers_ to him.

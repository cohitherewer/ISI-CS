The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Tata Steel help for varsity
                                                                                                           Tata Steel help for varsity
          AMIT GUPTA                               
	Ranchi, April 25: Tata Steel has offered to host the proposed central university of Jharkhand in Jamshed- pur and has promised its vice-chancellor D. T. Khathing a well-equipped building from where it could start functioning.        
	If the plan works, the state capital could lose the chance to host the new varsity, as the state department of human resources was yet to identify land to set it up permanently. Dhanbad was the other option.         
	Yes, Tata Steel has offered us with a temporary accommodation for the new varsity. At present, thats the only option I have as the state is yet to confirm a accommodation in and around Ranchi or Dhanbad, Khathing told The Telegraph.        
	Under any circumstances, we are determined to start academic activities from July, he added.        
	Thankful for the support of the steel major, Khathing said its officials were thorough professionals and action- oriented.         
	The space offered by them is quite big for holding classes as well setting up administrative offices, he added, but declined to reveal further details.        
	The vice-chancellor is now in talks with the University Grants Commission (UGC) to finalise courses for the 2009 academic session and to shortlist names of faculty that would ultimately have to be ratified by the Union ministry of human resources once a new government is in place at the Centre.        
	Khathing, who was assigned the task of heading the new varsity in March 1, has been scouting for land since then but hasnt met with much success primarily because of the political instability that finally led to Presidents rule being imposed in Jharkhand.        
	In private, he is said to have expressed his unhappiness to many about the authorities indifference to a project that would ultimately benefit the entire student community of Jharkhand.        
	Earlier, the state government had promised to find a permanent site for the campus, either in Ranchi or Dhanbad. That was followed by a search for a temporary venue to begin with. But, nothing much has moved.

          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 8: Indian intelligence agencies have warned of terrorist threats to at least six big dams this month.         
	The Centre has asked Himachal Pradesh and Punjab to be extremely cautious after which two high-level security review meetings were held by the two states, sources told The Telegraph.        
	A meeting was also chaired by the power secretary in Delhi after the intelligence inputs were received. The power ministry has sought security by the CISF, which now also protects airports, to big dams, the sources said.        
	The intelligence inputs have referred to a plot that goes beyond blowing up dams. Instead, the inputs warn of plans to take charge of equipment in the control rooms of the dams, sources said. Once the controls are in hostile hands, the floodgates could be opened to wreak havoc, the agencies have warned.         
	On January 20, the Research and Analysis Wing is learned to have informed the Centre of a joint plan by the Jaish-e-Mohammad and the Lashkar-e-Toiba to launch a co-ordinated operation in Himachal and Punjab.         
	Some of the potential targets are Bhakra dam and the Gobind Sagar reservoir on the Sutlej, Pandoh on the Beas and Chamera on the Ravi, the sources said. The Maharana Pratap Sagar project in Himachals Kangra and the Nathpa hydroelectric project are also under threat, sources said.         
	According to the intelligence alerts, infiltration for this specific mission could be through the chinks along the Nepal and Bangladesh borders with logistic help from the Harkat-ul Jehad-al Islami (Huji-Bangladesh).        
	Last month, a high-level review meeting for security of dams was held by agencies from states as well as the Centre. Some efforts have been made to increase security for vital installations, a Punjab police officer said.        
	The sources claimed that the plan was hatched in late December in camps in Muzaffarabad and Muridke.         
	Pak reply to dossier        
	Pakistan television channels reported that the government there was expected to seek consular access to Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, the lone terrorist captured alive during the Mumbai attacks. Pakistan has drawn up its response to the terror dossier India had submitted.        
	The channels said Islamabad would offer to try Kasab in Pakistani courts. The reply is also likely to say that the Mumbai attack plot was hatched in a European country.        
	The Pakistani cabinet panel is scheduled to discuss the report on Monday.

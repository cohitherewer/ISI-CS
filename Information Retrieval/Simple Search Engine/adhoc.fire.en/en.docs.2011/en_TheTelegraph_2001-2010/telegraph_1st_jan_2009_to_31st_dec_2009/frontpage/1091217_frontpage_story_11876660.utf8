          NASIR JAFFRY                                           Zardari      
	Islamabad, Dec. 16: Pakistans Supreme Court on Wednesday declared illegal a graft amnesty, known as National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO), reviving all corruption and criminal cases against more than 8,000 politicians and bureaucrats, including President Asif Ali Zardari, in a major political setback to the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party.        
	The NRO is declared to be an instrument void ab initio being ultra vires and violative of various constitutional provisions, chief justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry said, while reading out the ruling as the head of a 17-judge bench of the apex court, which heard several petitions challenging the NRO for 10 days.         
	The Pakistan government had last month released names of up to 8,000 beneficiaries, including Zardari , who got themselves cleared from graft cases under the NRO promulgated by former dictator Pervez Musharraf in 2007.         
	The decree was issued in the late 2007 as part of a power-sharing deal with slain Opposition leader Benazir Bhutto.         
	The deal also paved way for Bhutto to return home from an eight-year self-exile in October 2007. But she was killed in a gun-and-suicide attack during an election rally in Rawalpindi on December 27, 2007, clearing the way for Zardari to be nominated for office of the President by his Pakistan Peoples Party in August 2008.         
	The NRO cleared 8,041 politicians, mostly from Sindh, charged with graft between January 1, 1985, and October 12, 1999, closing cases against them.         
	The government had early this month decided not to bring NRO in the parliament -- the ordinance expires on November 28 -- apparently under pressure from its former ally, Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), which believed that tabling of the ordinance in the federal legislature would bring a bad name for the lawmakers.         
	Nawaz Sharif , who was ousted from power by Musharraf in October 1999, did not receive any benefit from the proposed legislation as it covered only politicians up to October 12, 1999.        
	As a consequence of the said declaration, all steps taken, actions suffered, and all orders passed by whatever authority, any orders passed by the courts of law including the orders of discharge and acquittals recorded in favour of the accused persons, are also declared never to have existed in the eyes of law and resultantly of no legal effect, the top judge said.         
	He added that all cases in which the accused persons were either discharged or acquitted would stand revived and relegated.         
	The court also ordered the government to contact the Switzerland government and seek revival of cases of money laundering, which were ordered to be closed by a former attorney general Malik Qayyum. These cases, the number of which could not be immediately known, were registered against former premier Bhutto and Zardari.         
	The court asked the government to proceed against Qayyum in accordance with law for addressing unauthorised communications which had resulted in unlawful abandonment of claims of the government of Pakistan, inter alia, to huge amounts of the allegedly laundered moneys lying in foreign countries including Switzerland.         
	Presidential spokesman Farhatullah Babar said the President would respect the court decision but there is no question of him stepping down.He said that none of the corruption and criminal cases registered against President Zardari could be proved in any court of law.         
	It was not clear what action premier Yousuf Raza Gilani would take against several ministers, including interior minister Rehman Malik and defence minister Chaudhry Ahmad Mukhtar, who were among beneficiaries of the NRO.         
	Chaudhry had declared, while hearing five petitions challenging the NRO just days ahead of the imposition of emergency in 2007, that those receiving an amnesty would not be entitled to claim any protection (from prosecution) if this court concludes that the ordinance and its provisions are beyond the constitution.

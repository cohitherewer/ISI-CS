The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | After bus plunge, police sleep
                                                                                                           After bus plunge, police sleep

	Howrah, July 5: The owner of the minibus that fell off Bankim Setu yesterday went into hiding and the police bosses into denial about Howrahs traffic horrors as the toll today rose to 12.         
	Bus owner Jahar Ghosh, a resident of Sankrail, left home before a police team went looking for him in the morning and couldnt be traced till late in the evening, sources said.        
	Superintendent of police Neeraj Kumar Singh was unavailable for comment as questions mounted about his departments 24-hour inaction since the accident.        
	 The biggest problem with Howrah police is that our top brass think there is no problem. We have been short of manpower for years but they refuse to strengthen our ranks, said a sergeant.        
	Chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said the only way to stop rash driving was by booking drivers responsible for fatalities under Section 304. Punishment should be strong enough to be a deterrent. There is a Supreme Court ruling on applying Section 304 against such drivers, he said.        
	Chakrabarti has convened a meeting of the transport and police departments tomorrow.        
	The government has been sitting on a seven-member committees report suggesting that errant drivers be booked under Section 304 for fear of antagonising Citu.        
	The maximum punishment under Section 304 is life imprisonment. Section 304A, which is now routinely used, is bailable and carries a maximum punishment of up to two years in jail.

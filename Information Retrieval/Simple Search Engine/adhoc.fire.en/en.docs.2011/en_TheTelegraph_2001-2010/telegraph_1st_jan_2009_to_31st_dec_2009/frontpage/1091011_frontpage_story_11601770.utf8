          NASIR JAFFRY AND AGENCIES                            A Pakistani army helicopter flies over its headquarters after the attack in Rawalpindi on Saturday. (AP)                                  
	Rawalpindi, Oct. 10: Suspected Taliban militants launched a 26/11-style attack on the headquarters of Pakistans army, engaging security forces in a gun-and-grenade battle before taking hostage 10-15 personnel in a military office adjacent to the heart of the countrys most powerful institution.         
	The militants sought to replicate the Mumbai model of compact groups shooting their way into high-profile establishments, but were thwarted at the second barricade of the Rawalpindi army hub.        
	At least six soldiers, among them a brigadier and a lieutenant colonel, and four gunmen were killed.        
	However, some militants  all were clad in army fatigues that would have confused the security forces  escaped during the morning gunfire and took hostages, which was disclosed only in the evening.         
	Army spokesperson Major General Athar Abbas said tonight that four to five militants were holed up in a security office building, close to the main gate of the heavily fortified complex in the garrison town, and had taken hostage around 15 personnel.         
	TV channel Dawn News reported late tonight that eight hostages had been freed. Sporadic gunfire could be heard.        
	The exact number of hostages cannot be immediately confirmed but there are 10-15 people, some of them civilian employees and some security personnel, Abbas said, adding that no army or intelligence officer was among the captives.         
	The army spokesperson had in the morning told Geo TV news channel, later ordered off the air, that the situation was under full control.        
	Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, an umbrella militant movement based in the mountainous, semi-autonomous tribal belt that runs along the border with Afghanistan, claimed responsibility for the attack that began around 11.30am (12 noon IST).        
	The militants, travelling in a white van, tried to break through the main gate of the army headquarters, deploying the stun-and-smash tactics seen in Mumbai. They shot at the guards at the first checkpoint, killing some of them, and then jumped out of the vehicle and ran towards a second post.         
	The militants then took up position throughout the area, hurling at least one grenade and firing sporadically at the security forces.         
	Abbas said six army soldiers embraced shahadat (martyrdom) as they foiled the hour-long attack. The slain brigadier and a lieutenant colonel, whose names were not disclosed, were passing through the gate.        
	The whereabouts of Pakistani army chief Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani was not known. Separate army statements said Kayani attended meetings at the headquarters and at the Presidents office in nearby Islamabad.        
	The assault was the third brazen attack in Pakistan in a week and came as the government said it was planning an offensive against insurgents in South Waziristan.        
	The attack on the army, once unthinkable in a country where it is held in awe and fear, has unnerved the establishment for the choice of the target. A terrorist blew up his car at the gates of the army headquarters two years ago but never before had a concerted raid been launched on the symbol of power in Pakistan.        
	It is also being seen as a challenge posed by the militants to the army, which has been bolstered by successful operations in the Swat valley and the killing of Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud in a CIA drone attack in August.        
	Soon after todays attack, army commandos encircled the area and helicopter gunships flew overhead, scenes reminiscent of the chopper vigil during 26/11. Like in Mumbai, the gun battle snarled traffic in a busy, congested commercial neighbourhood nearby.        
	Some Indian TV channels had been criticised for live coverage that allegedly gave away positions of helicopters to the remote handlers of the Mumbai attackers. In Pakistan, Geo and SAMA channels  known for their critical reporting of the government  were blacked out.        
	While the attack unfolded at the army hub, a court at Adiala jail, 15km away, formally charged seven suspects in the 26/11 case. The case was then adjourned for a week.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | BJP names RS hopefuls
                                                                                                           BJP names RS hopefuls
          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                              
	Ranchi, June 8: The BJP was first off the block today, declaring Ajay Maroo and Anup Agrawal as its nominees for the two Rajya Sabha seats, elections for which are scheduled for June 20.        
	Both members of the trading community, Maroo, a former Rajya Sabha member, was denied re-nomination in March 2008. Anup is the son of former Rajya Sabha member Parmeshwar Agrawal.         
	The deadline for filing nominations is June 10. But, the Congress and the JMM, which is contesting one seat each, havent formally come out with names.         
	JMM chief Shibu Soren has apparently decided to nominate son Hemant, while the Congress high-command is likely to come out with the name tomorrow. State Congress president Pradeep Balmuchu told The Telegraph that Sonia Gandhi had discussed some names with Jharkhand in-charge K. Keshav Rao. The central leadership will announce the nominee either late evening or early morning tomorrow, he said.        
	The way the numbers add up in the state Assembly _ its in suspended animation now _ the Election Commissions decision to hold separate elections for the two seats does not hold much hope for the NDA.        
	Yet, by nominating two prominent members of the Vaishya (traders) community, the party used the opportunity to reaffirm its credentials as a party of businessmen who formed its core vote-bank.        
	The two Rajya Sabha seats fell vacant after Yashwant Sinha and Digvijay Singh, both members of the Upper House from Jharkhand, were elected to the Lok Sabha from Hazaribagh and Banka, respectively. The tenure of both was to end on July 7, 2010.        
	 It takes at least 38 legislators to win a seat in the 73-member House. The BJP with 24 legislators, besides four from the JD (U), stands little chance of gettuig its nominees elected.        
	 No wonder, the Congress and the JMM are supporting each others candidates. We are giving one seat to the JMM, Balmuchu confirmed.        
	 The Congress-JMM-RJD combine has 33 seats and will need five more legislators. They are banking on Bandhu Tirkey, Bhanu Pratap Sahi, Stephen Marandi, Joba Manjhi and Aparna Sengupta.        
	The RJD, with seven legislators, is yet to decide.         
	The state Congress had forwarded four names: former MP Sushila Kerketta, Najam Ansari, Gopal Sahu and Dheeraj Sahu. However, names of former Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh and Mumbai Congress president Kripashankar Singh were also doing the rounds.        
	Deshmukh, who has been inducted in the Union Cabinet, he has to be a member of either House to continue as minister. The lone RS seat, going to polls in Maharashtra, has been vacated by Sharad Pawars daughter. So the NCP would like to retain it.

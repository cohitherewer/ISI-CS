The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Maoists kill four CISF jawans
                                                                                                           Maoists kill four CISF jawans
          SHEENA K.                              
	Raipur, Oct. 25: Maoists killed four Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) jawans by blowing up a patrol vehicle near Bacheli in Dantewada district of Chhattisgarh this evening.        
	Sources said six CISF jawans left for the Rajabungalow area, about 10km from Bacheli, where the National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC) has iron ore mines.        
	As the six jawans were returning to Bacheli, about 450km south of Raipur, after discharging their duties, the rebels detonated a powerful landmine that blew up the vehicle passing through a hilly terrain around 5pm.        
	The explosion was very powerful. It tossed the jeep several feet high in the air before it landed and broke into pieces, killing four CISF jawans on the spot, Amresh Kumar Mishra, the Dantewada superintendent of police, said.         
	The rebels opened fire indiscriminately soon after the blast, Mishra said. They later fled into the forests, but did not loot arms and ammunition of the jawans.        
	Two other jawans injured in the blast were rushed to the NMDC hospital in Bacheli where the condition of one was critical.         
	Sources said the attack on the CISF team could be in retaliation to the gunning down of a hardcore Maoist, Raju, by security forces in the same area last month. Three Maoist rebels were arrested too.

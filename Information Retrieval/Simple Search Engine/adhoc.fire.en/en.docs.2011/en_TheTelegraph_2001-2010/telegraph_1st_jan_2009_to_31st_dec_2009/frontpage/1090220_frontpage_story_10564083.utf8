The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Judges caught in lawyer riot
                                                                                                           Judges caught in lawyer riot
          G.C. SHEKHAR                              
	Chennai, Feb. 19: A stone landed on a judges forehead and another judge fell trying to escape police batons as lawyers, blood streaming down their faces, battled in Madras High Court today to resist the arrest of two colleagues for assault.        
	In the skirmish that lasted over three hours on the court premises, the lawyers set fire to a police station after the cops fired teargas shells at stone-pelting advocates.        
	The violence erupted after the police tried to arrest the two lawyers for Tuesdays rotten-egg attack on Janata Party leader Subramanian Swamy by pro-LTTE lawyers for demanding Tiger chief Prabhakarans deportation.        
	Chennai police chief K. Radhakrishnan said a group of lawyers pounced on his men when they tried to arrest the two on instructions from the high court. I intervened twice but the lawyers set the police station on fire.        
	The lawyers claimed the police arrested 12 colleagues who had gone to the court police outpost to file a complaint against Swamy. When we protested, there was unprovoked lathicharge on us, said K. Murugan, a senior advocate.        
	Angered by the lawyers throwing stones and chappals, the cops smashed vehicles parked on the campus. Justice A. Adityan was hit when he came out to inspect the damage to the vehicles and had to be taken to hospital. Judge P. Murugesan, who came out with acting Chief Justice S.J. Mukhopadhyaya, fell while retreating as cops came charging at the lawyers around them.        
	The violence subsided after Mukhopadhyaya told the police to withdraw and not arrest any lawyer. The judge has sought a CBI probe into the violence.

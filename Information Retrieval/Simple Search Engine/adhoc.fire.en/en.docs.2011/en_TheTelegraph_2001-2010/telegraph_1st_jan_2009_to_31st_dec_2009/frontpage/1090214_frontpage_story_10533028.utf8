	Ranchi, Feb. 13: Rs 2.5 lakh in grants, a plot of land for a home and a substantial extra for the nature of weapons that a Maoist hands over are some of the incentives underlined in Jharkhands eagerly anticipated surrender and rehabilitation policy unveiled here today in the hope that it would encourage more rebels to give up arms and join the mainstream.        
	The policy, approved by Governor Syed Sibtey Razi at a meeting attended by his advisers, G. Krishnan, Sunila Basant and T.P. Sinha, not only seeks to make surrender an attractive proposition, but also hopes to ensure it remains a viable alternative by laying equal  if not more  stress on the rehabilitation of rebels and their families.        
	A screening committee headed by the district superintendent of police (SP)  including nominees of the deputy commissioner and additional director-general of police (ADGP)  will be the final authority to choose and decide who would be eligible for the benefits of the policy.        
	Once the beneficiaries are identified a rehabilitation committee headed by the deputy commissioner will work out packages for each surrendered rebel based on the broad parameters of the policy.        
	The kind of assistance and the quantum of funds a rebel gets will ultimately depend on his/her social, economic background, age and educational qualifications.        
	Sinha, who is in charge of home affairs in the state now under Presidents rule, claimed Jharkhands policy was the best in the country. The earlier policy unveiled during his tenure as DGP of Jharkhand in 2001, was based on the Andhra Pradesh model.         
	But it could not enthuse Maoists to surrender, he conceded. Now, the Andhra government, too, has revised the policy. Our policy is based on the best elements of policies adopted in other states and focuses mainly on rehabilitation of extremists.        
	The components of the package include a grant of Rs 2.50 lakh at the time of surrender (see box).        
	Also, additional funds have been earmarked for surrendering with weapons.         
	For example, a rocket launcher will fetch Rs 1 lakh; AK and sniper rifles Rs 75,000; .303 rifle/pistol/revolver Rs 15,000; remote controlled devices Rs 6,000; grenade/hand grenades Rs 2,000; wireless sets Rs 2,000 to Rs 10,000, depending on range; IEDs Rs 6,000 and a kilogram of explosives Rs 2,000.        
	The surrendered rebels will also be eligible for Rs 3,000 a month for a year for vocational training. It could be extended by another year in special cases. They will also get land and Rs 50,000 for constructing a house.        
	Also, surrendered extremists will be entitled to get the entire award money declared on their heads by the state government.         
	For instance, a politburo member would get Rs 12 lakh, a regional/special area committee member/state committee member Rs 10 lakh, an alternate central special area committee member Rs 8 lakh, a regional committee member Rs 7 lakh, a zonal committee member Rs 5 lakh, a sub- zonal committee member Rs 3 lakh, an area commander Rs 2 lakh, a squad commander Rs 1 lakh and a squad member Rs 30,000.        
	The policy also provides for legal help for former rebels.         
	The government will set up special fast track courts for quick disposal of pending cases against them.        
	Former chief minister Arjun Munda was sceptical about the new policy. Its success as touted by the administration would be known by the response it gets from Maoists, he said.         
	Naxalism has spread to several states. But the Government of India has no policy to lure Naxalites to the mainstream, he added.         
	Sources in the intelligence department said rebels were unlikely to be lured by the grants or other finacial incentives pledged in the policy. Maoists were were already earning crores in the form of levies they extort from the mineral and forest rich state. So money can hardly be the sole motivating factor, said a senior official.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Basu double pinch
                                                                                                           Basu double pinch
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 27: Jyoti Basu today conceded that the number of Left Front seats may come down if the Congress and the Trinamul Congress strike a poll alliance.        
	The nonagenarian leader also did not rule out a post-poll rapprochement with the Congress in contrast with the far more categorical assertion of CPM chief Prakash Karat discounting such a possibility.        
	The fight will be more tough. The number (of LF seats) may come down, Basu said, publicly articulating what many CPM leaders have been admitting in private.         
	At a closed-door meeting of the CPM state secretariat, he told the party to ensure Left Front unity at the grassroots so that a united Opposition would not be able to exploit acrimony among allies as it did in the panchayat polls.        
	The ailing leader, who had skipped party meetings for six months, resumed attendance since last week in an apparent effort to boost the morale of the Left in the run-up to what is being considered the toughest election in its three-decade run.        
	Another veteran, Benoy Konar, too, said a Trinamul-Congress alliance would have some adverse impact but added: We will win the majority of the 42 seats. He accepted that the Left tally might go down from 35 to 28 in Bengal.        
	Sources said the party was worried about losing at least 10 seats in south Bengal.        
	Asked whether the Left would support the Congress in case of a hung Parliament, Basu said: I cant say what will happen. No decision has been taken on it.         
	That Basu was not speaking his mind alone became clear from Konars comment. Right now, our line is to defeat both the Congress and the BJP. But the post-poll decision would depend on national equations. What clothes we will wear then depends on the weather, Konar said.        
	But Karat had asserted  a stand repeated in an interview published today in a party paper in Kerala  that 2009 is not going to be 2004.         
	After the elections, we will come to know who is going to be compelled to support whom. We dont see a situation where the Left would be forced to support the Congress, Karat was quoted as saying.

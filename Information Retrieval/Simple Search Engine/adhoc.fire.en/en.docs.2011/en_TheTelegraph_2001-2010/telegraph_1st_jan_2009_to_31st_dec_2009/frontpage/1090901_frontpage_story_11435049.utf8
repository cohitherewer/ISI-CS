The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Back in city, Tata to meet Sen
                                                                                                           Back in city, Tata to meet Sen
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Ratan Tata                                  
	Calcutta, Aug. 31: Ratan Tata is scheduled to meet Bengal industries minister Nirupam Sen tomorrow, the Tata chief reaching the city today for the first time since the Nano pullout in October last year.        
	Tata has requested to meet me. We will meet at my office in the afternoon, Sen said. Tata is in the city to attend the Tata Tea annual general meeting.        
	Sen said no agenda had been set for the meeting with Tata, adding that it would be a courtesy visit.        
	However, the government expects Singur to figure at the meeting. Senior industry department officials have been asked to remain free in the afternoon.        
	As Tata travels from an Alipore hotel to the AGM venue at another hotel in the heart of the city, he will be traversing a political landscape dramatically different from the one he bid farewell to last year on October 3.        
	In the intervening months, the political fortunes of Mamata Banerjee  Tata had said on the day of the pullout that I think Ms Banerjee pulled the trigger  have soared.        
	Unwittingly or otherwise, the venue of tomorrows courtesy call also reflects the change. Last time, Sen had called on Tata at his hotel late in the night, drawing criticism from Mamata. Tomorrow, Tata will call on Sen at the Camac Street office of the industry department. It is not known if Mamata, who was in Delhi on Monday, will be in the city tomorrow.        
	The Tatas have not yet announced explicit plans for Singur, sometimes suggesting that the automobile company could return if the situation improved and, at other times, indicating that the land could be handed over to a party nominated by the government.        
	Tata Motors had abandoned the Nano car project in Bengal and moved to Gujarats Sanand following protests by the Trinamul Congress.        
	The company has paid the lease rent of Rs 1 crore for this year and can legally keep 645.67 acres till March 15, 2010. The land for the Nano factory was leased out for 90 years. Around 290 acres have been leased out to 65-odd ancillary units.

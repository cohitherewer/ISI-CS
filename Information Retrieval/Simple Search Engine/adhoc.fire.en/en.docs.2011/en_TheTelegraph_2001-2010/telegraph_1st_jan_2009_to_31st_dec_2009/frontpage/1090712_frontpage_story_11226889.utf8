The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | ISI boss in touch with Delhi
                                                                                                           ISI boss in touch with Delhi
  - Singhs revelation signals readiness for pragmatic shift           SANKARSHAN THAKUR                       SEE YOU IN PARIS, PM: Indian guest troops march down the Champs Elysees avenue in Paris in preparation for the Bastille Day parade where Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will be the guest of honour. Joining French troops, the guests will parade down the Champs Elysees on July 14 to the sound of Indian martial music played by a 90-member military band.

	New Delhi, July 11: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today said the ISI chief has been briefing India on progress with bringing the 26/11 plotters to book, a startling revelation indicating that New Delhi is willing to forsake the rejectionist rhetoric of recent months and take a more pragmatic approach to dialogue with Pakistan.         
	Singh left journalists returning with him from the G8/G5 summit in Italy a little stunned when he let out that the Indian mission in Islamabad was in touch with the boss of the Inter-Services Intelligence, probably the first time the existence of a direct pipeline with the notorious Pakistani agency has been placed on record at this level.        
	After my talks with Zardari Sahib (at Yekaterinburg, Russia), our high commissioners have been in touch, we have had talks with the ISI chief. They have given some suggestions and some information on what they are doing about punishing those responsible for the Mumbai massacre. We hope they will move forward in this direction, Singh said on board the special flight back home.        
	Sources later told The Telegraph that ISI boss Shuja Pasha has been exchanging notes with top Indian diplomats and military attaches in Islamabad and that the inputs received were so far of a satisfactory nature.         
	It isnt clear how far these off-media exchanges have gone in addressing Indian demands that Pakistan take demonstrable steps against terrorists operating from its soil, but there is clearly a positive new spin on the dialogue process.         
	A statement by foreign ministry spokesperson Abdul Basit said Indias acting high commissioner in Islamabad was called to the foreign office today and handed a dossier pertaining to the Mumbai probe. Separately, India has been asked to provide further evidence required for legal and judicial process, it added.         
	The very fact of direct contacts with the ISI, deeply mistrusted in India, suggests significant movement. Pushed into an effective diplomatic impasse after 26/11, India seems to have worked on opening new windows on the Pakistani establishment in search of ways to end the deadlock.        
	That Pasha has been involved in recent exchanges is perhaps significant in itself. Pasha was to have come to Delhi in the immediate aftermath of the attack but had scrapped his trip overnight.         
	As if seeking to further ease the atmospherics when he meets Pakistani counterpart Yousaf Raza Gilani on the sidelines of the NAM summit in Egypt next week, Singh pointedly said that he didnt mean to cause any hurt to President Asif Ali Zardari when he flagged Indias terror grouse with him in full media glare at Yekaterinburg.         
	Let me say that what I had said to Zardari Sahib, I had not intended to say that in the presence of all the media. I simply forgot that the media were present there. It was not my intention in any way to hurt Zardari Sahibs feelings, the Prime Minister said. This could be a deft post-facto manoeuvre to send out signals that New Delhi wishes to do nothing to jeopardise dialogue and what was widely perceived as a public slight was really unintended.         
	Underlining the geopolitical realities of the subcontinent, Singh said: India and Pakistan are close neighbours, we can choose our friends but we have no choice with regard to our neighbours. And we will do all that is necessary to resolve all outstanding issues.        
	While he said he remained hopeful of a solution and was looking forward to meeting Gilani, Singh indicated no let-up in exerting diplomatic pressure on Pakistan on the export of terror to India. On every forum, my appeal to world leaders is that they put pressure on Pakistan to abandon the path of terror, he said.        
	Singh allayed suggestions that the Barack Obama administration was not as appreciative of Indian concerns as the George Bush presidency, with which the Indo-US nuclear deal was concluded.        
	I find President Obama to be very supportive of Indias development ambitions.... There is no basis for apprehension that the Obama administration will be less sensitive to Indias concerns than the previous US administration, he said.

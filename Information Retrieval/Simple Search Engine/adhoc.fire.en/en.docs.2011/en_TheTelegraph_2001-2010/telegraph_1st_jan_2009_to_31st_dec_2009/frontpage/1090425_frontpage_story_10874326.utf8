                                                                                                           Dev, Pinto pictured in romantic date
          ANITA SINGH                            Dev and Pinto in a scene from Slumdog Millionaire                                  
	Slumdog Millionaire stars Dev Patel and Freida Pinto are a couple in love, if the latest pictures taken in Israel are anything to go by.         
	Pinto was photographed nestling into Patels shoulder during a cosy al fresco lunch date. The actress is shooting her latest film, Miral, in Israel and Patel has flown out to see her.        
	Rumours of a relationship began shortly before Slumdog Millionaire swept the board at the Oscars in February. Pinto, 24, and Patel, who turned 19 this week, denied they were an item, but their cover was blown by co-star Anil Kapoor. When I meet them, I feel there is something happening, he said, adding that the couple shared a magical chemistry.        
	She says I have to look after him and I have to babysit him and that kind of stuff. They definitely make a great pair. Both of them look very good together.        
	Pintos ex, Rohan Antao, blamed Patel for their relationship breakdown. I dont know if they were having a sexual relationship but if I came face to face with him I would have things to say. Now everywhere I go I see them on billboards. I am devastated, he said.        
	The lovebirds come from very different backgrounds  Pinto is a glamorous former model from Mumbai, while Patel still lives with his mum in Harrow. It was Dev Patels mother who persuaded her son to audition for his debut role in the E4 drama Skins, in which he played a sex-mad teenager.        
	Slumdog Millionaire has propelled both actors to Hollywood stardom. After Miral, Pinto will film a role in Woody Allens next film, while Patel has been cast in M Night Shyamalan adventure The Last Airbender.

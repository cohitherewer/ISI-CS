The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Where few women   vote
                                                                                                           Where few women   vote
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                                                    
	Wayil Wedar (Ganderbal), May 7: Democracy was at work Afghan-style in this Pashtun neighbourhood of Ganderbal today: the right to vote was a near-exclusive preserve of the men.        
	Pashtuns form the majority in nearly half-a-dozen villages in Ganderbal district, including Wayil Wedar, Gotlibagh, Banjar, Baba Wayil and Chanihaar.        
	On a day people in large parts of Srinagar boycotted the election in response to a separatist strike call, voting was not taboo in this Pashtun stronghold. For most of the women, though, the ballot remained a forbidden fruit.         
	Just nine of the 276 women voters turned up at the 57 Wayil Wedar polling booth where the turnout was 50 per cent for men.         
	Poll officials said this was the trend in other Pashtun villages too. Our women do not come out to vote. Nowadays you do find a few women near the booths, but earlier you didnt see even that, said Shah Jahan Khan, a village elder.        
	In contrast, men and women came out in almost equal strength among the Pashtuns ethnic Kashmiri neighbours.        
	A few thousand Pashtuns had migrated to Kashmir nearly a century and a half ago but their attachment to their culture never weakened. They still largely prefer segregation between the genders, their women moving about in purdah unlike their less conservative Kashmiri counterparts.        
	Altaf Ahmad, a young Pashtun, said the community had no problem with women voting as long as there were separate booths for them.        
	You dont have separate booths here, so there is no question of women voting, he said. This isnt the case with voting alone. We have just a few working women.        
	Villagers said the women faced more restrictions before, with few girls going to school and fewer to office. Now many girls do go to school but few are allowed to take up higher studies.        
	Parvez Khan, a jobless youth, had accompanied his mother, sister and sister-in-law to the polling booth. Voting is my right, so why shouldnt I vote? asked the 60-year-old Zubaida Khan, Parvezs mother.        
	Zubaida said that earlier, her husband would cast her vote on her behalf. Our women are conservative and it was their men who would cast their ballot as well. Things are slowly changing now, she said.        
	Shah Jahan Khan, the elder, did not agree fully. We are loyal to our culture. Those women who are voting are mostly relatives of the agents of political parties. Our ordinary women still do not vote, he said.        
	Khans culture bans not just the mixing of the sexes but any marriage outside the clan.        
	We neither give our girls in marriage to Kashmiris nor do they give us theirs. Occasionally, a girl will elope with a boy of the other community; but our relations with the Kashmiris are cordial. We live peacefully here, he said.        
	The overall turnout in the Srinagar parliamentary constituency -- which includes Srinagar city, Ganderbal and Budgam -- was 24 per cent. Srinagar city, virtually under siege to prevent anti-poll protesters from creating trouble, recorded 12 per cent polling.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Darjeeling, Dec 1: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha today made a turnaround with its leadership announcing that the party would not accept any interim administrative arrangement for the hills once the DGHC is dissolved.         
	Any alternative arrangement in place of the DGHC has to be statehood and nothing less. There has been some confusion and we would want to clarify that the party will not accept any interim arrangements, said Morcha general secretary Roshan Giri here today.         
	After the third round of talks in New Delhi on August 11, a Union home ministry release had stated: It was agreed in principle to repeal the DGHC Act 1988. The repealing of the act would be processed as soon as an alternative administrative/framework is finalised through mutual consultations and agreement.         
	The alternative administrative framework clause in the release created much confusion with ABGL president Madan Tamang alleging that the Morcha had already agreed to a DGHC double in place of Gorkhaland. His comments caused a political debate in the hills, with the Morcha stating that its goal was only achieving statehood.         
	Adding to the confusion was Harka Bahadur Chhetri, spokesperson of the Morcha, who declared yesterday that the interim arrangement had to be time bound, encompassing the entire district of Darjeeling and parts of the Dooars and Terai apart from being more powerful than the Sixth Schedule status that the government had once agreed to confer. Chhetris statement had partially vindicated Tamangs allegation even though the Morcha spokesperson had talked about a time-bound set-up.         
	Giri, however, urged the hills to stop listening to government stooges , referring to Tamang without naming him. We will not budge an inch from the statehood demand. Our agitation is for Gorkhaland and nothing else, said Giri.         
	Observers believe that the party was under tremendous pressure to clarify its stand given the fact that conflicting statements were being issued by the Morcha leadership.         
	The party hopes todays clarification will end the confusion over the alternative arrangement although sources said the Morcha demand for dissolving the DGHC is unlikely to be met soon as the home ministry has made its clear that it will be possible only after a stand-in set-up is in place.        
	In the meantime, the interlocutor for the fourth round of talks, Lieutenant-General (retired) Vijay Madan, is scheduled to arrive in Darjeeling tomorrow.         
	Asked if the Morcha will tell the interlocutor that they do not want any interim arrangements, Giri said: There is no question of informing him.

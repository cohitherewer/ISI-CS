          JAYESH THAKER                              
	Jamshedpur, Aug. 22: The steel city may not be home for Ranji ties anytime soon.        
	The Keenan Stadium, built in 1939 and once known for its plush outfield, is not being considered by Jharkhand State Cricket Association (JSCA) to host one of the four ties allotted to the state by Board of Cricket Control in India (BCCI).        
	Instead Ranchi and Dhanbad will be hosting the matches as Jamshedpurs landmark stadium, named after John Lawrence Keenan, a former general manager at Tata Steel, will be occupied for the 34th National Games scheduled for November.        
	Thats the official reason. But sports lovers in the state agree the real reason behind Jamshedpur losing out on first class cricket was because the JSCA and Tata Steel, the owners of the Keenan, have never really seen eye to eye.        
	The genesis of their strained ties lies in the long-drawn dispute over control of the game in Jharkhand  from the time the Cricket Association of Jharkhand (CAJ) was formed in 2001, a year after the state was created out of Bihar.        
	In 2004, the Jharkhand State Cricket Association was formed by renaming the Bihar Cricket Association that controlled the game in undivided Bihar, paving the way for BCCI to grant recognition to JSCA, making it its representative in the state.        
	The dispute is now in court with CAJ, headed by Tata Steel MD B. Muthuraman, and JSCA, headed by Amitabh Chaudhary, battling it out legally since 2004-05.        
	No wonder the steel major, which owns and maintains most of the sports infrastructure of Jamshedpur, has chosen to distance itself from JSCAs activities.        
	Officials of JSCA privately admitted they werent optimistic about Tata Steel making Keenan Stadium available for this years Ranji matches all along. Especially after it had to forgo the England-India ODI in November last year when the company cited security reasons and did not provide the venue.

  - In bitter political saga, wait for a sweet sign           RASHEED KIDWAI                             In demand                                        
	New Delhi, Feb. 11: Digvijay Singh is waiting impatiently for his box of laddoos.        
	If the mouth-watering golden yellow balls he was promised many weeks ago dont arrive soon, it could leave a bitter taste in Digvijays mouth  and sour ties between the Congress and the Samajwadi Party.        
	The two parties that had been looking at an alliance for the general election have had several run-ins in recent days  over seats to be shared, Sanjay Dutts nomination, Kalyan Singh, and a CBI case against Mulayam Singh Yadav.        
	In the last two days, the fight has got very bitter, with Samajwadi chief Mulayam Singh Yadavs lieutenant Amar Singh levelling serious allegations against Congress president Sonia Gandhi that he later withdrew.         
	Today, general secretary Amar made it worse when he said his party would field a candidate against Congress MP Priya Dutt  her brother Sanjay is to contest from Lucknow on a Samajwadi ticket.         
	But all could be forgiven if that box of Motichoor ke Laddoo, made in desi ghee, was delivered, it seems.         
	Digvijay had tasted them at Mulayams home, and found them to be simply divine.               
	The laddoos  made of milk, besan, sugar, almonds, saffron, pistachios and cardamom and fried in desi ghee  that sweeten every celebration in north India were passed around.         
	Digvijay had one, and couldnt stop. Mulayams son Akhilesh then promised to send a box to the Congress leaders Delhi address.        
	The Congress general secretary has been waiting since. Digvijay thinks the goodwill gesture of sending laddoos will signal that the Samajwadi leadership means business. It will also demonstrate to Sonias point man for the alliance that the Samajwadis trust him.        
	The laddoos said to be named after Motichur, a small town near Hardwar in Uttar Pradesh, hold a special place in festivities across north India. No wedding is complete without the laddoos.         
	But this time the laddoo seems to hold the key to match-making. An important contact was established today between the Samajwadis and the Congress, where the request for the Motichoor ke Laddoo was repeated with the promise they wouldnt be shared with Congress leader Satyavrat Chaturvedi, an anti-alliance leader who loves to bait Amar Singh into a verbal duel.        
	Congress leaders getting impatient for the box to arrive, at the partys 24 Akbar Road headquarters or Digvijays home, would do well to remember: Shaadi ka laddoo, jo khaaye woh pachhtaye, jo na khaye woh bhi pachhtaye (Whether you marry or not, you repent either way). This holds true for political marriages, too.

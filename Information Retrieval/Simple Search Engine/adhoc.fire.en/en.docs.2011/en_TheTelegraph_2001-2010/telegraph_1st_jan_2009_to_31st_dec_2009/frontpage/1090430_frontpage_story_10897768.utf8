  - SRK back home for vote and work          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                                                    
	Mumbai, April 29: Shah Rukh Khan had vowed to barge in (to) Calcutta with the IPL trophy and show some new dance moves.        
	With the odds stacking up against his Knight Riders, he will make good a part of the promise and dance  not in Calcutta, but at a Mumbai wedding.        
	The actor flew back to Mumbai on liquor baron Vijay Mallyas private jet today to cast his vote in tomorrows election. I will go back only if the team does well, the star said on arrival, hours before the Knight Riders lost yet another match, ironically to Mallyas Royal Challengers in Durban.        
	Vote or no vote, he would have returned on Wednesday because he has been hired to dance at a wedding in Mumbai on Thursday, said an aide of the actor who himself could not be reached for comment.        
	Sources said Shah Rukh would be paid around Rs 2 crore for a 20-minute performance at the wedding of Mumbai builder Kanti Gowanis nephew.        
	The actor had reportedly charged Rs 1.5 crore for his number at the wedding of steel tycoon Lakshmi Mittals daughter.        
	Earlier, the plan was to perform at the Gowani wedding and then return to South Africa. But now with his team doing so poorly, he has decided to stay put in Mumbai. In fact, negotiations are on with a couple of other parties who are keen to hire him for such private performances, said the SRK aide.        
	Shah Rukh had said last year that if his IPL venture hit red despite the advertising revenue, he would break even by dancing at a few more weddings. He had also requested Sourav Ganguly and John Buchanan to dance at the beginning of every game. The steps, obviously, didnt match.        
	Sources said the actor has now sent out word that he would be available for weddings  not just to dance  but as a full-time guest. He can be available, say for three days, for Rs 12 crore, said a source in GS Entertainment, the event management company handling the Gowani wedding shows.        
	The Gowanis have already circulated an invitation card for the wedding that lists the names and photos of the stars along with the days and wedding events for which they would perform.        
	There will be two pre-wedding shows  on April 30 and May 2. The first show will have Shah Rukh, Bipasha (Basu), Rani (Mukherjee) and Emraan Hashmi. Shiamak Davar will choreograph Shah Rukhs show and television actress Rakshanda Khan will be the master for ceremonies, said the source in GS Entertainment.        
	Kanti Gowani refused to comment on SRKs performance. I do not wish to comment. It is a private family affair, he said.        
	AFRICAN SMOKE        
	Dancing at weddings apart, SRK, according to well-placed sources, has a few other reasons for deciding not to return to South Africa.        
	He is also miffed with the constant focus of South Africas anti-tobacco lobby on his smoking in the stadium, said a source in Kolkata Knight Riders.        
	The South African anti-smoking lobby has targeted footage of smoking celebrities on television after Supersport, the official broadcaster of IPL in the country, showed SRK puffing away in the stadium.         
	The National Council Against Smoking (NCAS) of South Africa took up the issue with Indias National Organisation for Tobacco Eradication (NOTE) after Supersport cameras had zoomed in on the actor smoking during a KKR match on April 21 (against Kings XI Punjab at Kingsmead, Durban).        
	Shah Rukh, sources said, was apparently livid after IPL bosses refused to side with him on the issue.        
	Back in Mumbai, SRK is expected to throw a party for visiting Scottish actor Gerald Butler on May 1.

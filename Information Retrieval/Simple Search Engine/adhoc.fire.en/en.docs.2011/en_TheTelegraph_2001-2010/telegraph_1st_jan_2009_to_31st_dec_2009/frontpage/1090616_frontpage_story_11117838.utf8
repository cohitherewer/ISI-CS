The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Maharani? Not in Cong
                                                                                                           Maharani? Not in Cong
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, June 15: The Congress has just gifted the country a few more aam aadmis.        
	Sonia Gandhis party has nudged the former rajas, maharajas and maharanis in its ranks to shed their royal honorifics, nearly four decades after her mother-in-law abolished Indian princes privy purse and officially de-recognised feudal titles.        
	The Congress has banned the mention of royal titles in its communiques and decided that all its official records will be purged of references to Maharajas, Rajas, Kunwars, Rajkumars, Shrimants, Maharanis and the like.        
	The commonplace Shri, Shrimati or Kumari will have to do (and Madam, of course, for Sonia herself).        
	Such feudal titles will henceforth not be on official records of the party at any level, PTI quoted Congress general secretary and media cell chief Janardan Dwivedi as saying.        
	The trigger was the discovery that some party royals, including Union ministers Jitin Prasada and R.P.N. Singh and Pratapgarh MP Ratna Singh, were using their titles in their profiles on the Lok Sabha website.        
	Prasada and Singh had attached Kunwar (denoting a minor prince) to their names and Ratna had tagged herself Rajkumari (Princess).        
	All three are from Uttar Pradesh. Their ancestors had earned their titles by virtue of owning small principalities, carved out of bigger fiefs.        
	On the pedigree scale, though, the blue-blooded nobility of Rajasthan, who reigned over much larger kingdoms, would not have condescended to share a table with them, much less a title. Prasada and R.P.N. had, therefore, to be content with the humbler Kunwar instead of the weightier Maharaja.        
	Another inspiration for the ban could be an advisory to the media from the Congress government in Rajasthan yesterday, asking them to stop using royal titles and words like riyaasat (a princely state).        
	The motive in Rajasthan may have been to end references to former chief minister Vasundhara Raje of the BJP as Maharani, but the national-level decision may be seen as consistent with the Congresss slogan of being the party of the common man.        
	The party, of course, has its own royalty  going by the way any member of the Nehru-Gandhi family is treated  and Rahul Gandhi has often expressed his dislike when older people have tried to touch his feet. Congress supporters, however, do not address the Nehru-Gandhis with feudal honorifics.        
	Such a decision was long overdue, said Alwar MP Jitendra Singh, who belongs to the royal Alwar clan of Rajasthan and is a close aide of Rahul.         
	I have been brought up like any other person. When people address me with a certain title, I immediately make my displeasure clear.        
	Some Congress sources, however, wondered whether such historical baggage can be shed without a drastic change in mindsets.        
	I have seen how a former raja likes our party people to sit on the floor while he occupies the lone chair, placed strategically as though he is holding a durbar. This gentleman addresses our seniors as if they are his equals, a functionary said.        
	Many Congress bigwigs in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab like to be --- or insist on being --- addressed as royals. Party lore is replete with tales of how dedicated workers were denied posts or poll tickets because they would not address their leader with feudal subservience.        
	Congress sources joked that the surest way of bagging a quick appointment with Jyotiraditya Scindia, 38, is to refer to him as Maharaja. At his election meetings, people are often addressed as Gwalior ki praja (subjects).        
	When Jyotiradityas aunt Yashodhara Raje was a minister in Madhya Pradeshs BJP government, a notification had asked staff to address her as Shrimant.        
	Jyotiraditya, however, hasnt used the title on the Lok Sabha website; nor have fellow Congress MPs Ijyaraj Singh (Kota), Karan Singh (Jammu) and Chandresh Kumari (Jodhpur).        
	The list of politicians with royal tags is endless: Arjun Singh (Kunwar); former Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh (Maharaja), junior foreign minister Praneet Kaur (Maharani), Digvijay Singh (called a rather irreverent Diggy Raja).        
	Traditionally, the Congress was never the first party of the rajas and maharajas, who backed the Swatantra Party and later the Jan Sangh. Over the years, however, many of the rajas and ranis put the blows from Indira behind them and began looking at the Congress as a genuine career option.        
	With inputs from Rasheed Kidwai

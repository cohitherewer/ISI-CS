          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranchi, Nov. 18: An Enforcement Directorate (ED) team is expected to arrive in the capital tomorrow to grill former chief minister Madhu Koda, facing probe for allegedly amassing assets worth over Rs 2,000 crore through hawala transactions and illegal investments.        
	Koda, busy organising rallies to garner support for his Jharkhand Nav Nirman Morcha candidates in the Kolhan region, however, claimed that he had not received any summon. The ED has not summoned me. So, there is no question of going to Ranchi now, he said from Chaibasa, but added he would have no problem to do so if asked to.        
	Sources in Delhi maintained that ED deputy director Prabha Kant and additional directors Rajeshwar Singh and D.N. Poddar would question Koda from 3.30pm at the camp office, the investigation wing of the income tax department on the seventh floor of the tax annexe building in the capital.        
	ED sources also revealed that Manoj Punamia, the Mumbai-based hawala agent considered to be the kingpin of foreign money laundering on behalf of Koda and his key aides, Vinod Sinha and Sanjay Choudhary, had been arrested.                          
	The tax department has been unable to resume questioning Koda who left Ranchi on November 13 and showed up only at Chaibasa, his political bastion.         
	Income tax director (investigation) Ujjwal Chaudhary said that the department was continuing investigations and had good leads.        
	The department has also issued arrest warrants against Sinha and Choudhary.

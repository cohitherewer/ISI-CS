                                                                                                           Engineering students body kept in city morgue for 15 days and cremated as parents ran from pillar to post for 24 days
          KINSUK BASU                            Deepankar Sen Gupta with his son Atishs picture on September 3                                  
	Calcutta, Sept. 23: A 19-year-old engineering student from Kasba lay dead in a morgue in the heart of Calcutta for 15 days and was cremated as an unidentified body as his parents ran from one law-enforcement unit to another for 24 days.        
	The worst wait in the life of a father and mother ended last night not because of the efforts of Bengal police but because of a family friends initiative.        
	Atish Sen Gupta, a first-year electrical engineering student in a private engineering college in Beleghata, was reported missing on August 30. Atish had left his home on Nandibagan Road in Kasba around 6pm, promising to be back within an hour.        
	The family lodged a missing complaint with Kasba police station the same night.        
	Unknown to the family, Atishs body was found along railway tracks by Government Railway Police between Jadavpur and Dhakuria around 9.30 that night, around 2km from the Sen Guptas home.         
	The GRP records show that they sent information of an unidentified body lying on the tracks near Dhakuria to all police stations in the state at 11.32pm on the night of August 30. We were at Kasba police station between 11.20pm and 12.15am but were not told anything about it then or even later, said a relative of Atish.        
	How Atish, a boy who avoided local trains, died is a mystery but what unfolded later is a testimony to the information craters that bedevil the police.        
	The chain of mind-numbing events has some parallels with the travails of a father in the 1984 film Saaransh while trying to take possession of his sons ashes from customs officials.        
	The searing difference here is that Deepankar and Joyita Sen Gupta  Atishs parents  did not know that their sons body was lying in the NRS Hospital morgue  less than 15km from their home and in the heart of the metro.        
	In this age of split-second communication across continents, the police in Bengal could not put in place the missing link in the information chain that would have at least allowed the parents to take one last look at their son.        
	Deepankar, an IT professional, relatives and friends persisted with their efforts. They met senior police officers and lodged a complaint with the CID on September 1.        
	On September 3, the parents held a news conference in the city seeking information on Atish. Many newspapers, including The Telegraph Metro, published a report and the boys picture.        
	Members of the family kept visiting Kasba police station and the CID base. We went round and round seeking information on Atish from the police, said Debashish Sen Gupta, Atishs uncle.         
	From our end, we left no stone unturned. We managed to get his call details, got in touch with his friends from college and social networking sites and even took help from a handwriting expert to find out his mental state before he left home, Debashish added.        
	Finally, close family friend Arup Bardhan did what the police should have done. He visited Sealdah GRP two days ago and learnt that 13 bodies were recovered along railway tracks on August 30.        
	One of them, the body of a 32-year-old man, was found near Dhakuria station. The location of the body struck Bardhan and he decided to probe further. He visited Jadavpur GRP the next day and sought a picture of the deceased, recounted the relative.         
	Initially, the GRP official said the film couldnt be developed unless the entire roll had been exhausted. But the official finally obliged.         
	The face was not fully distinct in the photograph. Then the GRP officials produced two rings, which were identified as that of Atish.         
	The family was told that the body was cremated according to rules as no one turned up to claim it. We were told that the initial post-mortem had indicated that the death was suicidal in nature. But GRP officials are awaiting the final report, a relative added.         
	Senior CID officials refused comment. But a police officer said the local police station must inform the family of a missing person whenever they receive any information on an unidentified body with near-similar descriptions.         
	The GRP message had put the age of the victim at 32 Probably thats why they didnt inform us. But given the place where the body was found, it should have struck them, said a relative. We also dont know how the GRP could put the age at 32.        
	The police, however, were prompt on another count: they reached the Sen Gupta residence this morning.        
	They wanted to close the missing person case, a relative said.

(Sanat Kumar Sinha, file picture)                                
	Calcutta, Aug. 30: Gaffar Mollah grabbed land in Rajarhat and Bhangar taking the names of the three forces that matter in Bengal: the CPM, the Trinamul Congress and police, the fugitives close relatives have told The Telegraph.        
	A tale of political expediency  laced with remarkable ingenuity to get over seemingly irreconcilable differences  emerged after a reporter of this paper scaled the wall of the compound in which Gaffars house is located and ran into four of his relatives there.        
	He (Gaffar) is a rich man now. Hes earned a lot of money by grabbing land for Vedic Village, said one of Gaffars eight brothers, sitting outside a one-room tiled house.         
	The nine brothers live in the seven-cottah compound, adjacent to Vedic Village. Gaffars green house stands tall in sharp contrast to the brothers tiled houses in the compound, the main entrance to which has been locked since the arson at Vedic Village.         
	Behind the locked main entrance, the reporter could spot only four people  one of Gaffars brothers, two sisters- in-law and a niece  instead of the 35 who used to live there.        
	Gaffar called up after the trouble and asked all of us to leave. He can afford to stay elsewhere but we cant. We have to look after our cattle and poultry and so we come here during the day but spend the night elsewhere, said one of Gaffars sisters-in-law, pleading ignorance of the whereabouts of the land-sale enforcer, his wife and four children.        
	The brother said he had heard Gaffar speak about his connections with ministers. Gaffar often told us that he met ministers like Manab Mukherjee and Abdur Rezzak Mollah inside Vedic Village. He was also close to (Trinamul MLA) Arabul Islam and his brother Khude, said the brother, pointing towards the iron gate within the compound that opens into Vedic Village.         
	Contacted about the claim, Mukherjee, information technology minister earlier and in charge of tourism now, said: It is all baseless. I went there only once for the foundation stone-laying ceremony of the convention centre.         
	Land minister Mollah could not be contacted this evening to establish the veracity of the claim. He had earlier denied any links with Gaffar. MLA Arabul had also denied any association with Gaffar.        
	The land department had reached an out-of-court settlement with Vedic promoters who had also entered into a land-for-infrastructure deal with the government for an information technology park.        
	The brother claimed Gaffar, a wanted criminal in Rajarhat police station long before a teenager was shot dead near Vedic Village on August 23, showered gifts on policemen.         
	Gaffars professed reach was common knowledge in the area and even CPM cadres did not dare cross swords with him. Take the case of Nilotpal Dutta, a former CPM leader and secretary of the Rajarhat Jami Bachao Committee, who had to approach the partys higher leadership.         
	According to Dutta, he had complained to Rabin Mondol, the CPM MLA from Rajarhat and chairman of the Bhangar-Rajarahat Development Authority (Brada) and other party leaders several times about Gaffars threat to grab the land of farmers.        
	But I was told that the farmers had been selling their land voluntarily. But the ground reality was completely different, Dutta said.        
	Although the state home secretary has said land was acquired at gunpoint, Mondol is still sticking to his earlier stand. Local farmers may have grievances against the land mafia and Vedic Village. But I did not receive any major complaints from them earlier, said Mondol.         
	According to local CPM sources, Gaffar had links with Mondol but he switched to the Trinamul camp and drew closer to Bhangar MLA Arabul.        
	Gaffar was not alone in the land-grab game. Gour, the son of Khitish Naskar, the CPM pradhan of Mahishbagan-II gram panchayat, and Ruish Naskar, both with strong CPM connections, were known as Gaffars peers in the business, said a resident of Shikharpur.         
	Politics dissolved before the goldmine called land. In North 24-Parganas Rajarhat, where the CPM is strong, Gaffar knew which party to take orders from. In adjoining Bhangar that falls in South 24-Parganas, the scales tilted in favour of Trinamul.        
	The inclusive policy of co-opting rivals was assiduously followed, which reduced the possibility of malcontents blowing the whistle.        
	Gautam Deb, the housing minister who held up the land procurement policy in New Town as peaceful and successful, also faces such allegations. He tried to co-opt Trinamuls Tanmoy Mondol (a former Trinamul MLA from Rajarhat) and Arabul in his scheme of things to tame the farmers resistance to the land procurement for New Town, Dutta said.         
	A series of committees offered the necessary cover. Tanmoy Mondol was in the save-land committee but left it while Arabul, who earlier supported the committee, distanced himself after his contact with Deb.        
	Arabul had said yesterday he had received some calls from Deb but had stayed away. Deb had said he had called Arabul to discuss consensus on development projects.        
	With BRDA chairman Mondol as the head, another committee was formed with the stated objective of evolving political consensus and finding livelihood for landlosers.         
	The panel, the advisory facilitation committee, soon faced allegations that it was little more than a co-ordinator of syndicates supplying construction materials for projects in the area. The committee has Trinamuls Tanmoy Mondol and Joydeb Karmakar as members.

  Cong nurses a black eye, CPM unable to stem slide 
										      BISWAJIT ROY            
	Calcutta, Nov. 10: The Bengal bypoll results today left Mamata Banerjee a winner twice over  the Left slide worsened and her ally Congress stumbled in its north Bengal stronghold.        
	The Left Front lost all the three seats it held while the Congress could retain only one of its two among the 10 where bypolls were held. Not only does this give Mamata an advantage in future seat talks, she would have particularly enjoyed the Congresss defeat in Goalpokhar, home turf of her chief detractor in the party, Raiganj MP Deepa Das Munshi.        
	Trinamul not only retained its five seats in south Bengal but capped the performance by wresting Belgachhia East in Calcutta and Rajganj in Jalpaiguri from the CPM.               
	Mamata has now won a second seat in north Bengal, after Dinhata in 2006, much to the chagrin of many in the Congress who see the region as their partys stronghold.        
	The Trinamul chief called the results a tsunami of democracy and said they were proof that the CPM could not pull off the turnaround it had been promising its cadres.        
	The Left lost Kalchini and Rajganj in north Bengal and Belgachhia East  a seat held since 1977 by Subhas Chakraborty till his death and contested this time by his widow Ramala.        
	The CPM drew a blank, losing from all the five seats it contested, four against Trinamul and one against the Congress. The saving grace for the front was the Forward Bloc victory in Goalpokhar, North Dinajpur.        
	The Congress retained only Sujapur in Malda, the family borough of the late A.B.A. Ghani Khan Chowdhury. Its failure to win in Kalchini, which the RSP lost to a Gorkha Janmukti Morcha-backed Independent, will bolster Trinamuls claim to the seat in 2011, sources said.        
	Losing Goalpokhar, however, was the biggest blow to the Congress. Deepa had vacated the seat after she became an MP in May. Given the frosty relations between her and Mamata, especially after the Congress MP outsmarted Trinamul by taking Left support in the Siliguri mayors election, Mamata would feel she has had the last laugh.        
	Asked about the Congress-CPM understanding in Siliguri, Mamata said: I have got the reply of north Bengal (voters) from (the Trinamul victory in) Rajganj.        
	Her message for the Congress was subtle but unmistakable. She reaffirmed Trinamuls leadership of the Opposition alliance in Bengal and denied her party had a large enough presence in Goalpokhar to share the blame for the Congress defeat.        
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee declined comment on the results. In the evening at Nandan, where he had gone for the inauguration of the Calcutta Film Festival, the chief minister did speak about difficult times but the reference was to global problems, not to politics.        
	Most of the films weve brought this year were made in 2008 and 2009. (They were brought) to help (local viewers) understand the kind of films being made in these difficult times, he said. These films project contemporary problems, like international terrorism, military hegemonies, global warming.        
	It was left to CPM state secretary Biman Bose to accept the peoples verdict against Left candidates and promise the customary review.              
	CPM leaders admitted the continuing erosion in Left support among tribals, Scheduled Castes and Muslims. Bongaon, bordering Bangladesh and with a sizeable Scheduled Caste population, gave Trinamuls Gopal Seth these bypolls highest victory margin of 40,428, doubling the Lok Sabha lead from the segment.        
	The CPM leaders also accepted that Jyoti Basus appeal to Congress voters had not worked.         
	The margin of Sujit Boses victory in Belgachhia East underlined how the CPM was unable to stem the slide. In 2006, Bose had lost to the late Chakraborty by 1,749 votes, but in the 2009 Lok Sabha polls, Trinamul secured a lead of over 16,000 from this segment. Now Boses margin has rocketed to 28,360.        
	Polarised voting too may have added to Boses share: the BJP polled 4,839 votes, a nosedive from the 10,000-plus it had won from Salt Lake alone last May. The BJPs poor show hurt the CPM in Alipore, too, with Trinamuls Firhad Hakim winning by 27,555 votes, more than twice the margin of 11,302 recorded by his Trinamul predecessor Tapas Pal. Even Mamatas Alipore-segment margin of 24,000 was eclipsed by Hakim.        
	In Rajganj, the CPMs Lok Sabha lead of 30,000 votes vanished and Trinamul clocked a margin of around 15,000, probably aided by Morcha support. Unlike the Big Brother, the DSP, a minor Left Front partner, managed to halve the margin of Trinamul in Egra.         
	However, the surprise victory of Morcha-backed Independent Wilson Champromari in Kalchini and the emergence of the Adivasi Vikas Parishad as runner-up is likely to become a thorn in the side of both mainstream camps.        
	Incumbent RSP and challenger Congress lost the plot as the Morcha marshalled the lions share of the one lakh-strong Nepali-speaking vote and the Parishad attracted tribal support. Both the Left and the Opposition believe the Morcha will use the result to justify its claim on Dooars as part of a proposed Gorkhaland.        
	The Left blamed Mamata for the Morchas growing clout, citing her dependence on its support in Rajganj to defeat the CPM. Mamata denied the result would stoke any separatist movement and promised to accommodate the hill peoples demands without dividing Bengal.

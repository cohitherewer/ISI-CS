                                                                                                           Rebels kill three jawans
          SHEENA K.                              
	Raipur, Feb. 19: Maoist guerrillas shot three jawans of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and injured nine state police officers in Kanker district early this morning.        
	According to senior police officers, Maoists laid an ambush near Manhakal  a village situated some 350km south of Raipur  and attacked a joint troop of the CRPF and Chhattisgarh police jawans who were patrolling the thickly forested area.         
	Rebels first detonated a powerful landmine, before firing on the jawans indiscriminately. The personnel narrowly managed to escape the blast. However, three jawans of the 111th CRPF Battalion died of bullet injuries.        
	The deceased were identified as Manoj Kumar hailing from Haryana, Govind Singh from Maharashtra and Satyendra Yadav from Uttar Pradesh. Nine others were injured in the firing. The injured CRPF personnel were airlifted to Raipur, where they have been admitted to the Government Medical College Hospital. The condition of four jawans is said to be critical.         
	Reports reaching in from Kanker said that the guerrillas also attacked the second team of jawans who were rushed to the area as reinforcement after the incident. However, after the second team counter-attacked, the rebels slipped into the forests.         
	The red army chose to attack a month after some outfits offered to hold peace talks with the government. Todays blast and firing comes at a time when the government is seriously considering the peace talk offer on the condition that the Maoists first shun violence. Late last month, chief minister Raman Singh had reiterated the governments readiness to sit down for talks.

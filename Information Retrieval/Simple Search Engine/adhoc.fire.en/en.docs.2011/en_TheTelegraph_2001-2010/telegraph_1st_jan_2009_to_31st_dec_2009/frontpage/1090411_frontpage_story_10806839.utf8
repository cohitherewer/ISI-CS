The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Gentle PM wields the rapier
                                                                                                           Gentle PM wields the rapier
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 10: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today said he may not be a good speaker but was better than L.K. Advani at taking decisions, and suggested that those who inherit their parents culture do not use abusive language.        
	At a meeting with women journalists at his home, Singh appeared upset at Advanis iteration in Buxar today that he was a weak Prime Minister.        
	Kamzor ya strong judge karne ke liye zor zor se baatein karne se nahin hota (Loud words dont prove you are strong). Using harsh language does not solve any problem, the Prime Minister said.        
	I am not used to abusive language. That is the culture inherited from parents, from teachers and the concept of what Indianness is.        
	He added: I cant match Advaniji in public speaking or asserting things. I am not a good speaker, but I take decisions.        
	The proof of the pudding is in the eating, he said, asking: What is the record of Advani?        
	Advani was there during the Babri demolition. He could not protect it. How can he claim that he will protect the country with his strong leadership? He was the one who supported Narendra Modi during the Godhra riots. Advani termed Modi the best CM. He has no moral right to call himself the leader of the country, Singh said.        
	I am not a weak Prime Minister. We sent commandos to fight terrorists in Mumbai, unlike the BJP, which sent its external affairs minister to surrender at Kandahar.        
	Asked about Advanis demand for a TV debate with him, the Prime Minister said: The BJP has not allowed Parliament to function. The BJP shied away from all these discussions and now Advani wants to come and debate with me. I dont want to give him the privilege that he is an alternative Prime Minister.        
	On Advanis digs at his Rajya Sabha membership, Singh said: Advani has to amend the Constitution to ensure that his wishes prevail. Indira Gandhi had been one for one-and-a-half years; H.D. Deve Gowda, I.K. Gujral too.        
	Singh said Advanis economic policy would make the country bankrupt because it lacked vision and did not care about consequences.        
	Dismissing the BJP leaders claim about Indian money being stashed in Swiss banks, Singh said economist Ashok Desais column in The Telegraph had found several holes in Advanis claim.        
	The article, published on April 7, argues the figure of $0.5-1.4 trillion that Advani quotes is guesswork and that Indian money in Swiss banks may not be all illicit. It adds that most of it would have been deposited by NRIs, and that Advani could never get back any of it even if he became an iron PM.
           
	Referring to the Congress decision to pull out Jagdish Tytler and Sajjan Kumar from the polls, Singh said it showed that the party cared for public sentiments.        
	He said he had no personal view on the denial of tickets to Tytler and Kumar, but added: Better late than never.        
	Singh said the PMO had not been informed or consulted on the clean chit to Tytler. When I asked the CBI director (why the PMO had not been told), he said it was routine. Any charge that we manipulated the CBI report is false.        
	N-deal or resignation        
	Singh said he had contemplated stepping down as Prime Minister if the Indo-US nuclear deal fell through. Asked what the high-point of his tenure was, he said: Smooth passage of the Indo-US N-deal.        
	He acknowledged that the US had asked India to be part of its Afghan policy core group. We have not decided.        
	Asked whether India was being pressured to hold talks with Pakistan, Singh said: There is no pressure. Dialogue is a necessity but no dialogue until Pakistan gives proof of action on 26/11.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Row over ad on cancer vaccine
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Row over ad on cancer vaccine
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 24: Indias apex drug regulatory agency has threatened action against a pharmaceutical company whose advertisement saying a vaccine can prevent cervical cancer has triggered indignation in some medical circles.        
	The Central Drugs Standards Control Organisation has sent a showcause notice to GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) India, which issued the advertisement, the regulatory bodys officials said today.        
	The company markets a vaccine that has been shown to protect women from the sexually transmitted human papilloma virus (HPV), which has long been implicated in cervical cancer. GSK has labelled its advertisement a public awareness initiative.        
	But a senior researcher who has investigated the biology of cervical cancer and some doctors are arguing that the advertisement appears to oversimplify the complexity of cervical cancer and could mislead consumers.        
	Sources in the regulatory body said the content of the advertisement, which has appeared in publications in several cities, appears to violate a section of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act under which no prevention claim can be made about cancer.        
	We think that there has been a non-compliance with existing rules  so we have asked for an explanation and are now awaiting a response, an official said, requesting anonymity.        
	A GSK India spokesperson told The Telegraph: I can confirm that we have received a showcause notice regarding our disease awareness campaign on cervical cancer. We are in the process of responding.        
	Ideally, the vaccines are administered to girls during adolescence. Over the past year, paediatricians in cities across India have been urging parents of girls heading into their teens to consider the vaccine against cervical cancer.        
	The company declined to respond today to questions raised by sections of doctors who have argued the advertisement that they have seen does not provide certain relevant information that could help consumers make an informed decision.        
	There are several types of HPV and the vaccines available today have not been proved to be effective against all the HPV types that appear associated with the high risk of cervical cancer, said Bhudev Chandra Das, former director of the Institute of Cytology and Preventive Oncology and now a professor of biomedical research at Delhi University.        
	The available vaccines protect against two types of HPV that seem to account for 80 to 90 per cent of cervical cancer. But, Das said, studies in the past have detected at least 10 other high-risk HPV types in India.        
	Researchers also point out that the protection from HPV need not always translate into protection from cancer.        
	The vaccine is usually administered during adolescent years, and cervical cancer typically shows up after the 40s. The vaccines have been in the market for less than a decade  well need to wait for several more years to conclusively demonstrate protection from cancer, Das said.        
	A senior pathologist in Bangalore said the public awareness campaign had also failed to reveal that HPV was a sexually transmitted virus and the risk of picking up the virus increased with multiple sexual partners.        
	Studies during the 1970s through 1990s by the Indian Council of Medical Research had indicated that the risk of HPV and cervical cancer was highest in India among lower socio-economic groups.        
	The vaccine costs a few thousand rupees, and those women who are at the highest risk are unlikely to be able to afford the vaccine, said Lt Gen Dasarathy Raghunath at the Sri Dorabji Tata Trust Centre for Tropical Diseases, Bangalore.

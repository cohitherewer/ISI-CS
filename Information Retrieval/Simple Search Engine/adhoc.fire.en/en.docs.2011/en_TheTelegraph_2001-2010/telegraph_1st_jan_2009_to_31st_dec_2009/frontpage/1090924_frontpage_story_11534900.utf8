  - IP surveillance for Ranchi, Jamshedpur amp; Dhanbad          AMIT GUPTA                                    
	Ranchi, Sept. 23: Around 5,000 policemen at three venues, an internet protocol (IP)-based surveillance system involving 200 closed-circuit television sets (CCTV) and web cameras will provide foolproof security during the forthcoming National Games.        
	The state police headquarters has initiated the process to hire an expert agency that will execute IP-based surveillance at the main Games venue in Ranchi while the policemen will be deputed in Ranchi, Jamshedpur and Dhanbad.        
	We have received proposals from over 20 companies who are interested in supply, installation, operation and maintenance of IP surveillance systems during the 34th National Games. The bids will be opened after September 30, said inspector-general of police (provisions) Satya Narayan Pradhan, who also heads the sub-committee on security for National Games.        
	Over 40,000 people, including sportsmen and sports officials, will be present during the inauguration of the sports meet on November 21.        
	Pradhan told The Telegraph that they were contemplating installation of 200-300 CCTVs and web cameras in strategic locations under IP-based surveillance system. The interconnected cameras will be monitored from a control room.         
	Under the scheme of things, CCTV and web cameras will be installed both outside and inside the stadiums. Every entry point, access point, corridor, gallery and crowded areas will be equipped with such gadgets where every second monitoring will be possible. Under the IP system, senior police officers will be able to access pictures captured by CCTVs through their laptops or desktops.        
	The authorities are supposed to spend anywhere between Rs 2 crore and Rs 4 crore to install the facilities that will also include high-value cables and switches.         
	The 5,000-odd policemen will be issued instructions to keep a hawks eye on movement of people in and around the Games village.

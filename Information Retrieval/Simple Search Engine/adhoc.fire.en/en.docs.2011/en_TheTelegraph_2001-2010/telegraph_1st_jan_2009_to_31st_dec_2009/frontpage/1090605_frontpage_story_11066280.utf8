	Patna, June 4: Patna High Court today allowed the newly elected Palamau MP, Kameshwar Baitha (JMM), to travel to New Delhi for his oath-taking ceremony in Lok Sabha with police escort.        
	Baitha, a member of CPI(Maoist), is at Bihars Sasaram jail.         
	He is an undertrial prisoner with several cases of murder, police attacks and illegal possession of arms pending against him in police stations of Rohtas and Chatra (Bihar) and Palamau (Jharkhand).        
	Justice Mridula Sinha accepted Baithas prayer to attend the session, but directed the inspector-general (prisons) to escort the leader to New Delhi for a day.        
	Yesterday Baitha made a prayer to the high court seeking permission to travel to Delhi for his oath-taking ceremony as a Lok Sabha MP. Baitha contested from Palamau.

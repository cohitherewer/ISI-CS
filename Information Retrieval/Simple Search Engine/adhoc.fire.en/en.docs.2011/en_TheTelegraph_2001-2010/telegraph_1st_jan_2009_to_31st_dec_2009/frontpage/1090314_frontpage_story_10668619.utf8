The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Jaitley jolt to party over businessman 
                                                                                                           Jaitley jolt to party over businessman 
          SANJAY K. JHA                            Jaitley: Sulking                                  
	New Delhi, March 13: Arun Jaitley today stayed away from the BJP election committee, blowing the lid off multi-layered feuds within what is usually considered a ritual-bound parivar.        
	Jaitley skipped the BJPs central election committee meeting because of infighting over a businessman, Sudhanshu Mittal, who has been appointed co-in-charge of the partys affairs in Assam by Rajnath Singh.        
	The spark has been lit by Mittals nomination but the ground for Jaitleys uncharacteristic display of displeasure was laid by conflicting pulls and pressures involving several rungs of leadership, including Prime Minister candidate L.K. Advani and BJP president Rajnath.        
	Advani had gone out of his way to make Jaitley the BJPs chief election campaigner, the abbreviation of which is similar to that of a constitutional post that recently found itself at the centre of another feud  the chief election commissioner who wanted his colleagues removal, much to the delight of the BJP.        
	Today, at the party election panel meeting that Jaitley skipped, the claws, suitably wrapped in deceptive velvet gloves, leaped out.        
	Murli Manohar Joshi asked why such a minor irritant  the differences over Mittals appointment  should become a media spectacle. As Sushma Swaraj, said to be close to Mittal, and Venkaiah Naidu, seething after Jaitley was chosen over him to lead the campaign, joined the chorus, Joshi slipped in a seemingly innocuous statement: All of us have to accept the decision taken by Advaniji.        
	Anywhere else, such a statement would have been considered a compliment to Advani but not in the cut-throat world of politics. Joshis statement served to reinforce the perception that some people were not willing to accept the word of Advani.         
	Rajnath and Jaitley never had cordial relations, the chill becoming more pronounced after the Delhi lawyer was removed as spokesperson.        
	Sources said the tide at the meeting turned against the absent Jaitley with even Advanis other acolytes pointing out that the chief campaigner should not have stayed away from the meeting at a time the BJP is confronting adverse events such as the Naveen Patnaik walkout in Orissa.        
	The sources quoted Sushma as saying there were all kinds of people in the party and all of us dont like everybody. But, she added, these matters should be discussed privately with the president.        
	Naidu expressed concern at the negative publicity ahead of polls. The general feeling at the meeting was that the person in charge of the campaign should have attended, the sources said.        
	But Jaitley, who did not attend the meeting in the first half, chose to stay away when the panel met again in the afternoon. The sources said Jaitley would continue to stay away from the panel until Mittal was dropped but would attend other party fora. But some leaders said Jaitley, despite enjoying Advanis support, could have bitten off more than he can chew.        
	Mittal, known for his proximity to the late Pramod Mahajan, was formally attached to S.S. Ahluwalia, the in-charge of Assam, a few days ago. Jaitley, who nurses a personal dislike for Mittal, promptly conveyed his displeasure to the party.        
	But the party leadership felt that Mittals appointment had become a necessity in the wake of controversies surrounding the seat-sharing negotiations with the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP).        
	Mittal was one of the facilitators of the alliance with the AGP. The trouble began when an AGP faction that was opposed to any understanding with the BJP accused its leader Chandra Mohan Patowary of selling seats through a Delhi businessman.         
	Patowary mounted pressure on the BJP to formalise Mittals involvement. Jaitley was then quoted by some newspapers as saying Mittal was a power broker and had nothing to do with the BJP.         
	The AGP resented the statement and sought redress from the BJP which made Mittal the co-in-charge to avoid a repeat of Orissa in Assam. BJP sources claimed that Advani was also privy to the decision.

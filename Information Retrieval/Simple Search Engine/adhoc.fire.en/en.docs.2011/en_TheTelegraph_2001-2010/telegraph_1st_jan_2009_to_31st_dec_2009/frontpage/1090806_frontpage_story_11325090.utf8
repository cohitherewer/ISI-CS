The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Ready for flu test, not panic
                                                                                                           Ready for flu test, not panic
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                            People wait outside Naidu Hospital in Pune to get screened for the H1N1 virus. (AFP)                                  
	Mumbai, Aug. 5: Yesterday, only anxious students turned up. Today, almost everyone in Punes Camp area, where Indias first swine flu death occurred, thronged the government-run Naidu Hospital.        
	Wearing surgical gloves and masks, hundreds queued up to get screened for the H1N1 virus, jolted into taking the first step after Rida Sheikh, the 14-year-old from the Camp area, died on Monday.        
	But the authorities, overwhelmed by the rush, complained that many were overreacting. There is panic, mainly in the Camp area. General practitioners and private hospitals are overreacting and referring people with no symptoms of the flu to Naidu Hospital. This is not fair, said Pune municipal commissioner Mahesh Zagade.        
	The queues began forming outside Naidu Hospital at 6 this morning. By noon, they snaked over 2km, from the main road into a narrow lane next to the building.         
	By 12 noon we had screened over 500 people, 90 per cent of them just had common flu. Their private practitioners didnt want to take chances and sent them here for screening so these doctors didnt get into trouble themselves. It is so unprofessional, said Dr S. Parshute, who is in charge of the hospital.        
	Only three of the 700 screened today showed any symptom of the flu, he said, adding that the hospital wasnt prepared to handle such huge numbers.        
	We have now deployed 15 more doctors (in addition to the existing seven) to take care of patients who come on their own without being referred by doctors for the tests, said Parshute.        
	Naidu Hospital and Aundh Hospital in Pune are the only two government-approved centres for swine flu screening after the Epidemic Act was invoked in the area.        
	We have been screening 100 patients a day since swine flu broke out. On Tuesday, after news of Ridas death spread, we screened 400. Today, we had to call police after scuffles broke out among those waiting to get screened, said Parshute. Some hospital windows were also smashed.         
	But the police, too, were reluctant to come for fear of catching the infection. Even the police were initially wary. We had to promise them masks and gloves, said Dr Ashok Ingle of the hospitals swine flu detection ward.        
	Some who had been tested before wanted to be screened again, Ingle said, adding that trouble broke out when they were asked to leave. The pressure is tremendous as even those without any symptoms want to be screened. We have also spoken to the Armed Forces Command Hospital and it has promised help, said Ingle.         
	Ashwini Khandagade, whose daughter was among the three admitted to the hospital yesterday as a suspect case, didnt want to take any more chances: she got her entire family along this morning.        
	We are not being attended to properly. I hope this screening is valid. The government should allow some private hospitals to do the H1N1 screening. Two government hospitals cannot possibly handle the rush, she said.        
	Khandagade also had complaints about Naidu Hospitals quarantine ward. They keep all suspect cases together. What if one of them has the infection? The others will be infected, too. Also, children feel lonely when they are quarantined like this.        
	Parshute denied the claim, saying adequate precautions were being taken to prevent the spread of the infection.        
	There is no need to panic. Swine flu is not an unknown disease as some are making it out to be. It has been around since 1918.         
	Parshute said the hospital had enough stocks of Tamiflu tablets, used to treat the disease, to cope with an increase in the number of infected patients.        
	Outside hospitals, civic authorities have rushed to contain panic and launched an awareness drive. We will control the epidemic soon. All houses within 100 metres of Ridas will be screened. All children of Ridas school, St Annes, are being quarantined and screened, said municipal commissioner Zagade. Punes entry points, through which infected people could come in, dont have screening facilities yet.        
	Delhi IIT flu        
	An IIT Delhi student was among 22 fresh cases of swine flu reported from across the country today. The student is a resident of Faridabad and has been admitted to a Delhi hospital.        
	Of the 22 new cases, one is from Calcutta.

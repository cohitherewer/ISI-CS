The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Spy tag on US scientist tied to India 
                                                                                                           Spy tag on US scientist tied to India 
          PTI AND OUR BUREAU                            Stewart D. Nozette                                  
	Oct. 20: A US scientist, who played a key role in the Chandrayaan mission, was charged yesterday for trying to sell top-secret information to Israel for $11,000, federal prosecutors said.        
	Stewart D. Nozette, 52, was arrested on a charge of attempted espionage and is being held pending an initial appearance in US district court in Washington, authorities said.         
	They added that the charges stemmed from an undercover sting operation in which an FBI agent posed as an Israeli spy. Nozette allegedly passed the agent sensitive information through a dead drop at a Washington DC post office in recent weeks, authorities said.        
	Indian officials, who were in touch with US scientists over the countrys first unmanned lunar mission, insisted that there was no compromise with Isros security since Nozette was not given access to any sensitive information during his visit to India.         
	Nozette was involved in the development of the miniature Synthetic Aperture Radar, one of several foreign-made instruments aboard the Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft.        
	The mini-SAR was jointly developed by scientists at the Applied Physics Laboratory, Johns Hopkins University, and the US Naval Air Warfare Centre through Nasa. The instrument was intended to detect water ice in the permanently shadowed regions of the lunar poles.         
	Nozette was widely quoted and interviewed by the media in the US and in India during the Chandrayaan mission.        
	He was president of the Alliance for Competitive Technology, a non-profit group he founded in 1990. The scientist has held security clearances as high as top secret and had regular access to classified information.        
	Authorities would not say what prompted their investigation, but an FBI agent wrote in court papers that Nozette acted as a consultant for an unnamed aerospace firm that the Israeli government owned.        
	From 1998 to 2008, the scientist answered the companys questions and, in return, Nozette received regular payments from the company, the agent wrote.         
	He said the Israeli firm paid Nozette $225,000 during that span.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | A struggler again amp; damn hungry
                                                                                                           A struggler again amp; damn hungry
  - SRK rules out leaving the arena, veterans see zest that made a superstar				       PRATIM D. GUPTA                                    
	Calcutta, May 3: Thanks to the Kolkata Knight Riders, Shah Rukh Khan is again relishing the life of a struggler, much like his early days in Bollywood.        
	Its him against the rest all over again  the hatred, the jibes, as he wrote in a text message today. And a new hunger for success.        
	Which is why he is not going to sell his team, the actor said, dismissing the swirl of speculation as nonsense.        
	Contrary to what everyone is saying more than ever now I want to own the arena not run away from it, Shah Rukh wrote on a day the Knights again lost a close match, suffering a last-ball, six-wicket defeat by Kings XI Punjab.        
	Refusal to quit against odds is as much Bollywood as sport, but film industry veterans who have followed the actors career claim this attitude is part of the real-life Shah Rukhs make-up.        
	Shah Rukh is someone who doesnt admit defeat, said Aziz Mirza, director of Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman.        
	Its not that he doesnt understand defeat, but he is a fighter by nature. If something goes wrong it makes him more persevering and stronger.        
	Like the day a young Shah Rukh was auditioned for his first movie role  in In Which Annie Gives it Those Ones  chosen and then dropped. He had quietly returned to doing TV serials, waiting for the next chance.        
	Like when Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani, our first production, didnt do well, he simply put it behind him and moved forward, Mirza said.        
	Nine years on, Bollywoods Badshah is one of its most successful movie producers too.        
	Its the sort of transformation SRK may have hoped for the Knights in IPLs Season Two after they finished sixth in last years edition. After that disappointment, Shah Rukh, like no other team owner, had organised regular cricket camps for the team, even flying it to Australia for match practice in the run-up to IPL 2009.        
	At the same time, he appears to have prepared himself for another poor tournament. Before the start of this season, he had told this newspaper: I have had more failures than successes in my career but today people call Shah Rukh Khan a success because I could take all the beatings. I want to instil this feeling in all the Knight Rider kids.        
	Farhan Akhtar, who directed Shah Rukh in Don and is now a close friend of his, said: I think what he has achieved in his life by sheer hard work and self-belief is proof enough that he has a never-say-die attitude.        
	Director-actor Akhtar, who flew down last year to cheer the Knights at the Eden Gardens  as did SRK himself for most of the home games  added: This IPL season may not go the way he would have wanted for his team, but Im sure he will work towards getting it right the next time.        
	If he ever wants to sell his team, said Mirza, he will bring it right to the top and then do it. He will say, I have done it and only then let somebody else take over.    
	Shah Rukh Khan rsquo;s SMS reply to The Telegraph to a query  whether he was planning to sell Kolkata Knight Riders  
	Nonsense hellip; I have invested so much  love into our KKR team that even if I  want to hellip; nobody else in the world  can afford to match that. It rsquo;s amazing  and a first for me. People believe that  defeat means one should leave the  arena. It rsquo;s such a wonderful feeling  to be a struggler again hellip; hoping to  succeed hellip; losing again hellip; and again hellip;  feel the hatred hellip; the jibes hellip;. Been  a long time since I wanted to beat  failure again hellip;.      I feel younger, more energetic and so damn hungry now.  Contrary to what everyone is saying hellip; More than ever  now hellip; I want to own the arena hellip; not run away from it.  Inshallah, KKR will come out of this stronger than ever hellip;  and I am so proud being a part of this turmoil

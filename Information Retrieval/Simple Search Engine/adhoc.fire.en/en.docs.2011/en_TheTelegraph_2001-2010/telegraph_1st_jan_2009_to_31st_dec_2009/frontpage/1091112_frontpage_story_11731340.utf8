          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 11: The Bay of Bengal produces more frequent and fiercer cyclones than the Arabian Sea because of the Bays high fertility and the east coasts flatlands, according to meteorologists tracking Phyan.        
	Phyan, the cyclone that crossed the west coast between Alibagh and Mumbai this evening, had wind speeds of about 90kmph, while the previous cyclone Aila that struck Bengal in May this year had speeds exceeding 120kmph.         
	Historical records suggest that for every four cyclones in the Bay of Bengal, there is one in the Arabian Sea, said Basab Bandopadhyay, a scientist in the cyclone warning division at the India Meteorological Department, New Delhi.         
	Subtle differences between the way that convective currents behave over the Arabian Sea and over the Bay of Bengal may explain this higher frequency of cyclones forming over the Bay, scientists said.         
	There is a large-scale downward wind movement over the Arabian Sea during most of the year and convection has little chance to grow and intensify into cyclones, said K. Krishna Kumar, a scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune.         
	The Bay, however, is a zone fertile for the formation of intense storms, he said.         
	The westward wind flow direction in areas north of a cyclone in the Bay contributes to storm surges -- an abrupt rise in the sea level, mimicking conditions of a mini tsunami -- and significant water movement towards land, Kumar said.         
	The areas along the coasts of West Bengal, Orissa and Andhra Pradesh are also flat which makes them specially vulnerable to both inundation from storm surges and damage from the cyclones winds, he said.         
	The situation is different on the west coast where the high western ghats are close to the coast -- the entire chain of mountains within 100km from the coast. The western ghats is a strong barrier to winds, Kumar said.         
	Cyclones from the Bay of Bengal have claimed tens of thousands of human lives over the decades. The cyclone that struck Andhra Pradesh in 1977 and the supercyclone that wrecked the Orissa coast in 1999 had both killed about 10,000 people. Cyclone Bhola that hit Bengal and Bangladesh (then East Pakistan) in November 1970 was the worst in meteorological history, claiming an estimated 500,000 lives.

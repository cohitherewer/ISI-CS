                                                                                                           Cornered, ex-ministers comply 
          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                              (From top) Anosh Ekka, Harinarayan Rai				                                 
	Ranchi, Feb. 2: Buckling under pressure from the Vigilance Bureau, two former ministers Anosh Ekka and Harinarayan Rai today submitted dossiers on property acquired between April 1, 2004, and November 26, 2008.        
	The bureau, which has been investigating the two for allegedly owning property  moveable and immovable assets  disproportionate to their known sources of income, had on January 30 issued a 48-hour deadline asking them to submit details, failing which they were threatened with legal action.        
	Ekka, in his reply, has attributed the delay in submitting the details to campaign engagements during the recent Tamar by-elections. He, however, said he was ready to co-operate with the bureau in the future. It is not the final details. We will be submitting a supplementary statement, too, he said.        
	Rai attributed his delay to the seriousness of the issue. Since it is a court case, we had to make a comprehensive study before submitting it to the bureau, he said.        
	Asked, how he would justify his assets with his income, Rai laughed. Whatever I have submitted is genuine. It is not fudged (kisi tarah ka her-pher nahi hai).         
	DGP (vigilance) Neyaz Ahmad said: The former ministers submitted their statements to the investigating officer (IO). It will take some time to study them and come to a conclusion, he added.        
	Sources said the statement was voluminous, running into 100 pages in all. Their statement will now be matched with details in the complaint as well as in income-tax reports.         
	The bureau lodged FIRs against them under Prevention of Corruption Act on 26 November, 2008, on the directives of the special court (vigilance). Thereafter, it issued them a 10-page questionnaire on December 5 seeking details of immovable and moveable property acquired between April 1, 2004, and November 26, 2008, in a weeks time. They became ministers in 2005.        
	As of now, with the retirement of A.K. Singh on January 31, the vigilance special court is without a judge.         
	The court is scheduled to hear similar complaints against former chief minister Madhu Koda, former ministers Bandhu Tirkey, Kamlesh Singh and Bhanu Pratap Sahi on February 4.

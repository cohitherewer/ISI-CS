	Islamabad, Oct. 27: The Obama administration is putting pressure on Pakistan to eliminate Taliban and al Qaida militants from the countrys tribal areas.        
	However, the push is straining the delicate relations between the allies, Pakistani and western officials say.        
	The Pakistani militarys recent heavy offensive in South Waziristan has pleased the Americans. However, it has left large parts of Pakistan under siege as militants once sequestered in the countrys tribal areas take their war to Pakistans cities. Many in the country blame the US for the countrys rising instability.        
	When secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton arrives in Pakistan this week, as she is scheduled to do so, she will find a nuclear-armed state consumed by doubts about the value of the alliance with the US and resentful of ever-rising American demands to do more, the officials said.        
	The US is also struggling to address Pakistans concerns over the conditions imposed on a new American aid package of $7.5 billion over five years that the Pakistani military denounced as designed to interfere in the countrys internal affairs.        
	The Obama administration has endorsed the Pakistani Armys recent offensive in South Waziristan, suggesting it showed overdue resolve.         
	But it has also raised concerns about the armys long-term objectives. How South Waziristan plays out may prove to be a bellwether for an alliance of increasingly divergent interests.        
	The special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard C. Holbrooke, said on Friday that the Obama administration would be trying to find out whether the army was simply dispersing the militants or destroying them, as the US would like.        
	From the number of troops in South Waziristan, it was not clear that the army wanted to finish the task, said a western military attach, who spoke on the condition of anonymity according to diplomatic protocol.        
	The army would not take over South Waziristan as it had the Swat Valley, where the military is now an occupying force after conducting a campaign in the spring and summer that pushed the Taliban out, the officials said.        
	It remains to be seen how the campaign will play out in a region where the army has failed in the past, analysts said.         
	The army has sent about 28,000 soldiers to South Waziristan to take on about 10,000 guerrillas, a relatively low ratio, according to military specialists.        
	In all, of the roughly 28,000 soldiers, there are probably about 11,000 army infantrymen, said Javed Hussain, a retired army brigadier. Instead of a ratio of one to one, he said, the ratio should be at least five to one.        
	The army appeared to have no plans to occupy South Waziristan, but rather to cut the militants to size, said Tariq Fatemi, who served briefly as Pakistans ambassador to the US in 1999.        
	With the uncertainty of American plans in Afghanistan, and the strong sentiment in Pakistan that India was up to no good in the restive province of Baluchistan and the tribal areas, Fatemi said, the army would not abandon the militant groups that it has relied on to fight as proxies in Afghanistan and in Kashmir against India.

	Two suspected militants on a motorbike fired shots today at Brigadier Waqar Ahmed, his mother and the driver in Islamabad but missed, police said. No one is hurt, everyone is fine, senior police official Khursheed Khan said, adding that the assailants escaped.

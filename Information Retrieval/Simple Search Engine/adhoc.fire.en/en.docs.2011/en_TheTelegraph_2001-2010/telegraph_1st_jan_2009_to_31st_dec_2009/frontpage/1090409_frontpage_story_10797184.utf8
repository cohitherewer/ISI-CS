	Ranchi, April 8: Durga let down his father and party chief Shibu Soren by refusing to withdraw his candidature for the Godda parliamentary constituency today, thereby driving a wedge between the JMM and the Congress who had both worked painstakingly on a seat-sharing formula.        
	Furkan Ansari, the sitting Congress MP and party candidate for the seat that JMM wasnt supposed to contest, was furious. He called the JMM anti-Muslim, alleging that both father and son were in on the conspiracy against his party.        
	Durgas decision had the blessings of Shibu. Had it not been so, he would have sacked him for defying the party leadership. Besides, an FIR should have been registered against Durga for forging the party symbol, he told The Telegraph.         
	He said Durga had exposed the JMM to be anti- Muslim. It is a betrayal. And the JMM will pay the price in these elections, he thundered.        
	Congress in-charge for Jharkhand K. Keshav Rao tried to downplay the controversy, saying the Congress-JMM deal would survive in Jharkhand as only one seat (Godda) had been disturbed.         
	In fact, Rao was still hopeful of a patch-up. His father (Shibu) has told me that he will persuade him to opt out of electioneering, he said.         
	At the same time, Rao criticised the Godda DC and returning officer Virendra Ram for not rejecting Durgas nomination during scrutiny.        
	It was a joke not to reject the nomination when the head of the party had said that anybody submitting forms A amp; B, apart from the seven official candidates, could be using forged documents, he said.        
	Rao termed irregular the returning officers decision not to accept Sorens faxed message clarifying Durga wasnt the partys official nominee.         
	More than the Congress, it is the JMM which stands to lose because of Durgas move which has put a question mark on its ties with its UPA ally.                                       
	If JMM candidates were worried, the partys working president and Rajmahal nominee Hemlal Murmu voiced their concerns. Durgas action will have an adverse impact on our poll performance. I will be the worst sufferer, he conceded.         
	Basant, Durgas youngest brother who is with Shibu at AIIMS in New Delhi, said his father would continue to support the Congress. He will also persuade Durga to opt out of electioneering, he told The Telegraph.        
	Durga did not turn up to meet his ailing father at AIIMS till late in the evening.        
	In Godda today, Furkan Ansaris son, Irfan, and his supporters waited at the collectorate for either Durga or two of his partymen who had proposed his name to come and withdraw his nomination.        
	But that did not happen.         
	There are 23 candidates in the fray here. We dont have any request for withdrawing the nomination of JMM candidate, said the SDO and election officer of Godda, Ramchandar Paswan.

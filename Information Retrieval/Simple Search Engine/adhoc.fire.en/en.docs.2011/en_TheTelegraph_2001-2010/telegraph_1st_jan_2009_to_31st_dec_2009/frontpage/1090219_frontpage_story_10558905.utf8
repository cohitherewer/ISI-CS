	Mumbai, Feb. 18: Amitabh Bachchan today visited Shah Rukh Khan, who got back home yesterday after a shoulder surgery.        
	Bachchan drove to Mannat, Shah Rukhs seafront mansion in Bandra, this evening.        
	Shah Rukh, who had a surgery to repair a tear in the main muscle of his left shoulder at Breach Candy on Monday, was said to have told Bachchan he returned home early as he was feeling depressed in the hospital.         
	Yesterday, Bachchan had urged Shah Rukh not to take the post-surgery period lightly and avoid any kind of activity. The two spoke after Shah Rukh called to thank Bachchan for his message wishing him a speedy recovery.        
	Bachchan recounted the conversation on his blog later yesterday. Do not take after-surgery too lightly, I warn him, take rest and do not get into any kind of activity. He sounds a little groggy. I shall visit him tomorrow. He spent almost an hour with Shah Rukh today.        
	This was Shah Rukhs second surgery, the first was conducted in London in 2003 for a back problem.        
	Shah Rukh and wife Gauri had visited Bachchan at Lilavati Hospital in December 2005 when he underwent an operation for jejunal diverticulitis and was hospitalised for 19 days.        
	The two actors, who have starred together in blockbusters like Mohabbatein and Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham, have repeatedly said they share a cordial relationship despite persistent speculation about their rivalry.        
	The talk about their cold vibes intensified after Shah Rukh starred in the remake Bachchan classic Don in 2006 and followed him as the host in a sequel of Kaun Banega Crorepati.        
	The game show is behind them but the two still appear to have a penchant for games. Writing on his blog, Bachchan appeared to suggest it was time for play.                     Shah Rukh with wife Gauri visits Amitabh at Lilavati in 2005		    
	Come home sir, we shall play some games, he quoted Shah Rukh as saying when the two spoke yesterday and Bachchan said he had been planning to visit him in hospital.        
	They were known to have loved such light moments on the sets of Bhoothnath, their last film together which released in 2008, often laying the board for a hand at Trivial Pursuit and other games.        
	Their bonhomie on the sets helped muffle rumours of their rivalry, much before Bachchan began insisting on his blog they had always been good friends and how the media had set them up against each other.         
	The Bollywood Big Two might, however, rue having missed a game show that could have put them in Oscar spotlight: both Bachchan and Shah Rukh turned down Anil Kapoors role of a game show host in Slumdog Millionaire. The film has bagged 10 nominations for the Oscars, to be announced next Monday.

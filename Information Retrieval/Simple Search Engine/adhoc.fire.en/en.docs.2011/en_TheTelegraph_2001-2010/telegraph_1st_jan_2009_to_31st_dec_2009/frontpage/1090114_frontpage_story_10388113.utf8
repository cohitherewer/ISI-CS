	Mumbai, Jan. 13: Software behemoth Infosys today beat market expectations with a 33 per cent jump in third-quarter profits, and then claimed the Satyam scandal hadnt cast a shadow on its operations.         
	Customers clearly understand its a one-off event. We are not actively pursing either employees or customers of Satyam because we believe we should not accentuate their problems, Infosys chief financial officer V. Balakrishnan said.         
	The countrys second largest software exporter said its net profit in the quarter ended December 31 rose to Rs 1,641 crore from Rs 1,231 crore in the year ago period, making it the fastest growth in six quarters.         
	More important, profits rose 14.6 per cent over the second quarters Rs 1,432 crore.         
	However, it trimmed its annual forecast slightly as clients drove down contract prices in a global downturn. But Infosys continued to hire. It recruited 5,997 new employees in the third quarter, though this was sharp drop from the 10,117 in the previous quarter ended September 30 last year.         
	Infosys has one of the largest employee pools among infotech companies and reported 103,708 persons on its rolls. It plans to hire 3,700 in the next quarter, said chief operating officer S.D. Shibulal.

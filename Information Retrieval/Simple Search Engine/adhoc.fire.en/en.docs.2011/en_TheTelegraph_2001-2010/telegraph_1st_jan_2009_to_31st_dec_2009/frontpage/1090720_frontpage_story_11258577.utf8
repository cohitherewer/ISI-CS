                                                                                                           Tourism catches a ray of cash in solar eclipse
          CITHARA PAUL                            A teacher at an astronomy workshop on solar eclipse organised by the department of science and technology in Bhopal                                   
	New Delhi, July 19: When the sun slips into darkness this Wednesday, some people on earth will celebrate a ray of good fortune.        
	The solar eclipse, set to take place on July 22, has breathed life into the countrys downturn-hit tourism industry, with state governments and tour operators going all out to cash in on the rare celestial event.        
	Tourism boards of Bihar, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh are promoting spots in their states as the best point to view the early-morning phenomenon, the first total solar eclipse this century to be visible from India.        
	The country has to wait another 25 years for the next one.        
	Piyush Kumar Sinha, an official with the Bihar Tourism Department, said Taregana, 25km south of Patna, was the best place to view the eclipse.        
	This is something even scientists have agreed on. It (the eclipse) will have a longer duration here than any other place in the country because of its geographical location.        
	Sinha said Bihar was getting an overwhelming response from across the country. All our hotels are booked for the day.         
	In Gujarat, too, officials are doing everything they can to hard sell surya nagri Surat, another place considered the best to view the eclipse, and on the river Tapi, also known as surya putri.        
	The state government had organised a publicity event in Delhi as part of a marketing strategy while the Gujarat tourism corporation is working with the department of science and technology to promote the phenomenon.        
	Scientists say Surat is an ideal location as the eclipse will be visible best from the city between Vapi to Vadodara and for the longest period. That Atmiya Vidya Mandir near Kamrej has been identified as a location for Isro (Indian Space Research Organisation) scientists to observe the eclipse gives Gujarat the edge over other states, said Ranjan Bakshi, a representative of Gujarat Tourism in Delhi.        
	The Uttar Pradesh government is focusing on the religious aspect of the phenomenon.        
	Solar eclipse day is very important for any Hindu and a (holy) dip is something Hindus wouldnt want to miss, said Manish Prasada, an official with the Uttar Pradesh Tourism Board. Even for a non-believer, seeing the sky gradually change colour during the eclipse while sitting on the banks of the Ganga will be an unforgettable experience.        
	The Madhya Pradesh government will celebrate the event as Rashtriya Surya Mahotsava (National Sun Festival) on July 21, 22 and 23 with co-operation from the New Delhi-based National Council for Science and Technology Communication. It has invited all those who are interested in science to take part.        
	Some tour operators, like Cox amp; Kings, have arranged for chartered flights so that tourists can view the eclipse from above the clouds.        
	An official with Cox amp; Kings said the eclipse flight  which will take off from Delhi at 4.30am and fly towards Gaya  would last three hours.        
	The window seats have been divided into two categories  sun-side seats on the right and earth-side seats on the left.        
	Passengers on the sun-side seats, which cost Rs 79,000 each, will be able to photograph the eclipse while those on the earth-side seats (Rs 29,000 each) will be able to catch the lunar shadow moving over the earth, the Cox representative said.        
	According to the agency, the response has been overwhelming.

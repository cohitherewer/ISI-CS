          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                              
	Ranchi, Nov. 10: For a state that made history of sorts by hosting an Independent as chief minister, Jharkhand has now come full circle.        
	With Madhu Koda, the toast of the Congress and JMM in 2006, now at the centre of a Rs 2,000 crore scam in ill-gotten wealth, an Independent has become a political untouchable in the Assembly elections of 2009.        
	This means, sitting MLAs who had been denied tickets were trying their luck with rival parties. And if that didnt work, they preferred to sit at home, rather than join the fray as disgruntled Independents.        
	Desperate to shrug off its past association with Independents when it propped up the Madhu Koda government in September 2006, the Congress is steering clear of backing any such solo candidates this time.        
	There is a strong public mood against Independents. People are fed up with them. This time, they want a political party to win a clear majority no matter which coalition wins, said Congress spokesman Radha Krishna Kishore.        
	The Congress, which has re-nominated all nine siting MLAs, seems to have gauged the public mood early. We have no rebellion, except the one in Manishankar in Jarmundi. He, too, is being persuaded to withdraw. He will face action if he fails to toe the party line, he added.        
	So far, rebels havent been too much of a bother for the BJP either. BJP vice-president Madhulika Mehta has filed papers in Jamshedpur (East) which state party chief Raghubar Das is contesting. Except this case, there is no other rebellion, clarified state BJP spokesman Sanjay Seth.        
	And if the party denied a ticket to Chatru Ram Mahto in Gomio, he went and got himself a JMM ticket. Also, sitting MLA from Bishunpur Chandresh Oraon, denied a ticket by the BJP, is scouting for a chance to fight for the RJD.         
	As many as 644 candidates, including 165 Independents have so far filed papers for the 30 seats that go to the polls on November 25 in the first phase. Koda has announced nominees for five seats in West Singhbhum.         
	No wonder parties are wary of Independents. First, there is the experience of the Koda dispensation, widely perceived to be inefficient and corrupt. And now, the ongoing investigations into his wealth, allegedly amassed through illegal investments and money laundering.        
	The chargesheeting of two former ministers  Anosh Ekka and Harinarayan Rai  by the vigilance; FIRs against Koda and three of his Independent ministers  Kamlesh Singh, Bhanu Pratap Shahi, Bandhu Tirkey  by the vigilance bureau and Enforcement Directorate for owning disproportionate assets and money laundering; and the subsequent IT raids on the former chief minister and his associates, have all contributed to Independent becoming a bad word in state politics.        
	Nobody dares fight as an Independent any more. The possible financiers (read Independent former ministers) are themselves in trouble. So, prospective Independents arent getting funds, pointed JMM state youth wing president Vinod Pandey.        
	The JMMs rejects  it has denied tickets to three sitting MLAs Haru Rajwar (Chandankiyari), Thomas Soren (Barhet) and Munnalal (Giridih)  have been trying hard for a party affiliation. While Rajwar has managed a JD(U) ticket, Thomas Soren joined the Trinamool Congress. Munnalal, however, is reconciled to fighting as an Independent.        
	Contenders from Babulal Marandis JVM have been denied tickets after the former chief minister signed a pact with the Congress.        
	But nobody is fighting as an Independent, pointed out JVM leader Deepak Prakash.

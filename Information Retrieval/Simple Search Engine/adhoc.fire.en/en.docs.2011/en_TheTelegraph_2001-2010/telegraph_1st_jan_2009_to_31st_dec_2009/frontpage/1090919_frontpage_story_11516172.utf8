          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             The Taj hotel on fire during the Mumbai attacks                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 18: Terrorism is more likely when people of one country disapprove of the leadership or policies of another, a new study has suggested, challenging the idea that terrorists represent fringe groups outside mainstream society.         
	A new analysis of public opinion in one set of countries and terrorist incidents against targets from another set of countries has revealed a strong association between public opinion and acts of international terrorism.         
	The study by researchers at Princeton University in the US and Charles University in the Czech Republic indicates that the greater the levels of public disapproval in one country over the leaders or policies of another country, the higher the incidence of terrorism from the first country against targets from the second country. The study appears in the journal Science today.         
	Public opinion appears to be a useful predictor of terrorist activity, Alan Krueger, professor of economics at Princeton said in a statement issued through the university. This is the first study to relate public opinion across countries to terrorism.         
	Krueger, who has applied rigorous statistical techniques to analyse terrorism, was unavailable for additional comments on the study as he is currently with the Barack Obama administration as assistant secretary for economic policy in the US treasury department.         
	The study analysed 952 terrorist attacks documented by the US National Counterterrorism Center between January 2004 and August 2008, among which 841 were perpetrated by groups from Pakistan against targets from India.         
	Krueger and his co-worker Jitka Maleckova from Prague analysed public opinion obtained through polls in 18 Middle Eastern and North African countries, including Pakistan, and counted the number of terrorist attacks from these countries directed against people or property from nine powers  the US, the UK, Russia, Germany, France, Canada, Japan, China, and India.         
	A 20 percentage-point increase in the disapproval level of a countrys leaders... was associated with a 93 per cent increase in the number of terrorist attacks, they wrote in their research paper.         
	They dropped the Pakistan-India pair in the analysis describing it as an outlying observation, but point out that the findings of the correlation between terrorist incidents and public opinion are similar if the pair is included.         
	This doesnt appear surprising  negative public opinion in a society may enable terrorists to find recruits, said Alok Bansal, a senior fellow at the Institute of Defence Studies and Analysis, New Delhi.         
	But Krueger and Maleckova have cautioned in their report that their findings do not allow them to infer whether terrorists are responding to public opinion or whether they are responding just as the larger public in their own countries. But the results suggest that countries can try to reduce the risk of terrorist attacks by seeking to mould public sentiment in other countries.         
	The study has also indicated that richer countries with higher level of civil liberties are more likely to be targets of terrorist attacks. But, contrary to popular notions, terrorism is not associated with poverty in a country.

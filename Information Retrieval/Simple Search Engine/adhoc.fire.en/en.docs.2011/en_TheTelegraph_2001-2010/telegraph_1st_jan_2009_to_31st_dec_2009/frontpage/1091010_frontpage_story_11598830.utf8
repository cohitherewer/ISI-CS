The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Religion count of staff
                                                                                                           Religion count of staff
  - Centre to seek data from private firms too           CITHARA PAUL                                    
	New Delhi, Oct. 9: The Centre will ask public and private sector companies to do a religion-based headcount of their employees as part of an effort to end discrimination.        
	The companies will be requested to prepare a database that will have all details of their staff, including religion and caste, minority affairs ministry sources said.        
	Officials, however, have been reticent about the move, which has the potential to spark cries of religious profiling and a national controversy.        
	In 2006, a survey commissioned by the UPA government on the socio-economic status of Muslims in all government institutions, including the armed forces, had nearly brought MPs to blows in Parliament, with the Opposition alleging an attempt to divide the army along communal lines.        
	The current move is part of the build-up towards the constitution of an Equal Opportunity Commission to stop discrimination. Although this is being done with really good intentions, this can be easily misunderstood. So we are being very cautious, a ministry official said.        
	He said the ministry had already got in touch with select corporate houses, but unfortunately, the response has not been very encouraging, since the companies were concerned about potential controversies.        
	But we are trying to convince them that this (headcount) will take us closer to our aim of equal opportunity for all, the official said.        
	He added that the current request to companies would not be binding, but the government would later make it a law.        
	We are going to make it mandatory for all corporate houses to maintain a database of their staff. This would give the government, and particularly the Equal Opportunity Commission, which is going to be set up, a clear idea about the social and religious diversity among the workforce.        
	The ministry is now lending the final touches to the Equal Opportunity Commission Bill, to be tabled in the next session of Parliament. The commission will check discrimination based on sex, religion, caste, race, birthplace, descent and language, and will have court-like powers.

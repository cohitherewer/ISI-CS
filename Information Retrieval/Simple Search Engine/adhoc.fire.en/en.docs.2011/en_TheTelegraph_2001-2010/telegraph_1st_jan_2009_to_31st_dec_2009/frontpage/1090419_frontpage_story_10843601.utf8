The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Kiss of bother for Munnabhai
                                                                                                           Kiss of bother for Munnabhai
          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                            Sanjay, Mayavati: Sexist notice                                 
	Lucknow, April 18: Munnabhais hug for all ills has landed him in trouble  after he said given a chance, he would like to put his arms round Mayavati and seal the embrace with a kiss.        
	Sanjay Dutt, whose jadoo ki jhappi (magical embrace) formed part of his now-famous Gandhigiri in the Munnabhai films, was today served a notice by the district magistrate of Pratapgarh for making a sexist comment against the Uttar Pradesh chief minister.        
	District magistrate Pinky Jowal said the Samajwadi Party general secretary violated the model code of conduct for elections by his objectionable remarks at a campaign rally yesterday.        
	At the rally to canvass support for a party candidate, Sanjay had allegedly said he would give jadoo ki jhappi and pappi (kiss) to the people of Pratapgarh and, given a chance, would do the same with the Bahujan Samaj Party boss.        
	His statement goes against any woman, it amounts to violating the dignity of a chief minister, Jowal said.        
	BSP workers have also lodged a complaint against Sanjay, who was last month barred by the Supreme Court from contesting elections for his conviction in a 1993 Mumbai blast case.        
	The district magistrate later filed a complaint with Pratapgarh police, who converted it into an FIR.        
	M.K. Singh, a district police officer, said Sanjay had been booked under Section 294 (obscene acts and songs) of the Indian Penal Code this afternoon.        
	At the campaign rally for Akshay Pratap Singh Gopal at KP Hindu College, Sanjay had said that in Mayavatis scheme of governance, there were taps but no water, bulbs but no electricity, and hospitals without beds  a fit case for Gandhigiri, or curing a person by love and tolerance.        
	The theme Gandhigiri has recurred frequently in Sanjays campaigns.        
	In January this year, he had proposed to send flowers to the Dalit chief minister in a fitting reply to her obsession for stone  in other words, statues of herself and her icons.        
	But if that was a harmless dig, he went a step too far yesterday.        
	Todays FIR is the second against Sanjay in less than a week.        
	Earlier, on April 15, an FIR was lodged against the actor in Mau district for allegedly violating the model election code with communally sensitive remarks during an election rally.        
	The 49-year-old actor had told the meeting that after his arrest following the 1993 serial blasts, he had been subjected to third degree torture in custody because his mother was a Muslim.        
	Jab main police custody mein tha to policewale mujhe third degree dete the. Wo mujhe marte the aur kehte the ki tumhari maa musalman hai, he told the rally in Mau, where communal riots in 2005 had claimed at least 15 lives and led to massive destruction of property.        
	Mau police had interpreted Sanjays speech in support of Samajwadi nominee Arshad Jamal Ansari as an attempt to create a communal divide.        
	The district administration reacted fast and filed a complaint against the film star-turned-politician for violating the model code.        
	A case has been registered against the actor under Section 71(h) of the Representation of the People Act.        
	The section bars parties and candidates from indulging in any activity during election campaigns that might aggravate existing differences or create mutual hatred or cause tension between different castes and communities, religious or linguistic.        
	If convicted under the two offences, Sanjay, sources said, could be packed off to prison again for anything between six months to three years.        
	The problem is, even if he wants to, Munnabhai cant kiss and make up.        
	Surely, not after the complaint.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Patna, July 10: Six people, including four lawyers, were injured today in what prima facie appears to be a suicide blast on the premises of Bhojpur district court at Arra, 60km from here.        
	The incident on the eve of Chief Justice of India K.G. Balakrishnans visit to the state capital has sent the security apparatus in the central Bihar district into a tizzy. Balakrishnan and two other Supreme Court judges will be here to grace the centenary celebrations of Patna Law College.        
	Bhojpur superintendent of police Sunil Kumar said a crude, but powerful, bomb was used in the blast.         
	A young man, yet to be identified, triggered the bomb that was strapped to his waist while entering the chamber of an advocate.         
	He died on the spot while advocate Vinay Tiwary was critically injured. Five others  three lawyers and two petitioners  also sustained injuries. Tiwary has been admitted to Patna Medical College Hospital.         
	Kumar said that though prima facie it appeared to be a suicide blast, the youth did not appear to be a professional bomber. We suspect he was carrying the bomb for a different purpose. It may have been triggered accidentally. We are trying to ascertain the identity of the youth to fill in the gaps, he said.        
	District magistrate Susina A.N. said a posse of policeman had been posted on the court premises and the area cordoned off. Judges and lawyers are also being provided additional security.        
	A section of lawyers said they suspected personal enmity behind the incident. Jitendra Singh, who practises in the district court, had recently reported a threat to his life.        
	Kumar said the missing pieces of the puzzle would fall in place only after a thorough investigation. The truth will come to the fore soon. Right now, we are not in a position to draw any conclusion.

                                                                                                           Lucy under a sombre sky
  - Gravely ill, girl in song and Lennons son reconnect                                John Lennon with Julian and Yoko Ono in 1968. (AP)                                  
	London, June 12 (AP): They were childhood chums. Then they drifted apart, lost touch completely, and only renewed their friendship decades later, when illness struck.        
	Not so unusual, really.        
	Except she is Lucy Vodden  the girl who was the inspiration for the Beatles 1967 psychedelic classic Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds  and he is Julian Lennon, the musician son of John Lennon.        
	They are linked together by something that happened more than 40 years ago when Julian brought home a drawing from school and told his father: Thats Lucy in the sky with diamonds.        
	Just the sort of cute phrase lots of 3- or 4-year-olds produce. But not many have a father like John Lennon who used it as a springboard for a legendary song that became a centrepiece on the landmark album Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band.        
	Julian got in touch with me out of the blue, when he heard how ill I was, and he said he wanted to do something for me, said the 46-year-old Lucy, who has lupus, a chronic disease where the immune system attacks the bodys own tissue.        
	Julian, who lives in France, sent his old friend flowers and vouchers she could use to buy plants at a local gardening centre, since working in her garden is one of the few activities she is still occasionally well enough to enjoy. More important, he has offered her friendship and a connection to more carefree days. They communicate mostly by text message.        
	I wasnt sure at first how to approach her. I wanted at least to get a note to her, Julian said.         
	Julian added: Then I heard she had a great love of gardening, and I thought Id help with something shes passionate about, and I love gardening too. I wanted to do something to put a smile on her face.        
	Lucy admits she enjoys her association with the song, but doesnt particularly care for it. Perhaps thats not surprising. It was thought by many at the time, including BBC executives who banned the song, that the classic was a paean to LSD because of the initials in the title. Plus, she and Julian were four years old in 1967, the Summer of Love when Sgt. Pepper was released to worldwide acclaim. She missed the psychedelic era to which the song is indelibly linked.        
	I dont relate to the song, to that type of song, said Lucy, described as the girl with kaleidoscope eyes in the lyrics.        
	As a teenager, I made the mistake of telling a couple of friends at school that I was the Lucy in the song and they said, No, its not you, my parents said its about drugs. And I didnt know what LSD was at the time, so I just kept it quiet, to myself.            
	Lucy in the sky with diamonds  
	Picture yourself in a boat on a river,
  With tangerine trees and marmalade skies.
  Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
  A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.  
	 Cellophane flowers of yellow and green,
  Towering over your head.
  Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes,
  And she rsquo;s gone.  
	 {CHORUS}
  Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
  Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
  Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
  Ah... Ah...  
	 {VERSE 2}
  Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain,
  Where rocking horse people eat
  marshmallow pies.
  Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers,
  That grow so incredibly high.
  Newspaper taxis appear on the shore,
  Waiting to take you away.
  Climb in the back with your head in the clouds,
  And you rsquo;re gone.  
	 {CHORUS}
  Picture yourself on a train in a station,
  With plasticine porters with looking glass ties.
  Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile,
  The girl with kaleidoscope eyes.      
	Theres no doubt the fanciful lyrics and swirling musical effects draw heavily on the LSD experiences that were shaping John Lennons artistic output at the time - although many of the musical flourishes were provided by producer George Martin, who was not a drug user.        
	The imagery in the song is partly a reflection of Johns drug experiences, and partly his love of Alice in Wonderland, said Steve Turner, author of A Hard Days Write, a book that details the origins of every Beatles song.        
	At the time it came out, it seemed overtly psychedelic, it sounded like some kind of trip. It was completely new at the time. To me it is very evocative of the period.        
	Turner said his research, including interviews with Lucy and Julian, confirm that she is the Lucy in the song. He said it was common for John Lennon to snatch songs out of thin air based on a simple phrase he heard on TV or an item he read in the newspapers. In this case, Turner said, it was the phrase from Julian that triggered Johns imagination.        
	Veteran music critic Fred Schruers said Julian Lennons reaching out to help Lucy as she fights the disease is particularly moving because of the childlike nature of the song.        
	Its enormously evocative but with a tinge of poignancy, he said. Its the lost childhood Julian had with that little Lucy and the lost innocence we had with the psychedelic era, an innocence we really cherished until it was snatched away.        
	Lucy was diagnosed with lupus about five years ago after suffering other serious health problems. She has been struggling extreme fatigue, joint pain, and other ailments.        
	Shes not given up, shes a fighter, and she has her family backing her, thats a good thing, said Angie Davidson, campaign director for St. Thomas Lupus Trust, which funds research. We need more people like her, more Lucys.        
	Davidson, who also has the disease, said it affects each person        
	differently, typically causing exhaustion and depression. When the disease kills, she said, it does so by attacking the bodys internal organs.        
	 It has become difficult for Lucy to go out -- most of her trips are to the hospital -- but recently she and her husband went to a bookstore and heard the song playing over the stores music system.         
	When they went to another shop, the song was on there as well. That made me giggle, she said.

   Aila dies but kills from toe to tip          MEGHDEEP BHATTACHARYYA                                                    
	Calcutta, May 26: Aila has withered away but not before the beast worked its way up the spine of Bengal and wreaked havoc till the tip of the state in Darjeeling.        
	By 5.30pm today, all that was left of the remnant of the cyclone was a low-pressure formation in a trough over north Bengal. A low-pressure formation can cause scattered rain, not widespread destruction like a cyclone.        
	But before Aila transformed itself into a far less potent form, it had killed at least 82 people and rendered lakhs homeless. Ailas trail bound the south Bengal coast to the northern hills in a serpentine ribbon of destruction with as many as 20 deaths reported in Darjeeling in landslides triggered by the cyclone.        
	Aila also accelerated the advance of the monsoon and forced the rainy seasons early arrival in Bengal last night, 14 days earlier than usual. But weather analysts said the monsoon could be weaker for the initial fortnight because the cyclone, which covered 950km in 48 hours since it formed on Sunday evening, could have devoured much of its energy.        
	Climatologists and weather analysts blamed the long life and ferocity of Aila on global warming.         
	The tropical seas pack more heat now, compared with 15 years ago, because of global warming. That energy is absorbed by the moisture in the cyclone which has to spend it all before dissipation. Because of the increased heat, tropical cyclones like Aila will continue to last longer and be a lot more violent than even a decade or two ago, said geographer Satyesh Chakraborty.        
	Calcutta, however, saw a more or less clear day with only 2mm of rain till 5.30pm. We had anticipated heavy rainfall over south Bengal today as well. As it turned out, Aila dragged along with it most of the rain clouds over south Bengal and cleared the sky over Calcutta and the south Bengal districts, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	Going by what happened today in south Bengal, weather officials held out hope of respite for north Bengal over the next 24 hours. However, heavy rain and thundershower have been forecast at many places in the Northeast.

	Sept. 26: Suspected cadres of the National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB) abducted an employee of a construction firm from a makeshift camp in the foothills of Bhutan in the Bodoland area last night.         
	DM Jain Construction Company, engaged in a Rs 16-crore sluice gate project in the Dwisam river, had pitched the camp in the remote Khorang area under Udalguri police station in Assams Udalguri district.        
	Sources said cadres of the NDFBs Ranjan Daimari-led faction are active in the area.         
	Police said four youths on two motorcycles reached the camp around 10.30pm and whisked away Mongilal Parekh, 38, the head of the camps labour force, at gunpoint. Udalguri superintendent of police A.K. Tiwari said the youths fired two rounds in the air and warned the labourers not to inform the police.         
	The company authorities have denied receiving any extortion notes from any group or individual, he said, adding that a search operation had been launched in the foothills of Bhutan to rescue Parekh.         
	He has been held captive somewhere along the Indo-Bhutan border. Efforts are on to rescue him, the SP said.         
	Tiwari said there was little possibility of Parekh being taken across the border. The company authorities could not be contacted.

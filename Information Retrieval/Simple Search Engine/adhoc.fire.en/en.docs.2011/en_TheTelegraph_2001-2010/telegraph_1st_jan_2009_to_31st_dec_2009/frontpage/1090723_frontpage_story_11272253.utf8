                                                                                                           Shops can give cash to debit cardholders
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                              
	Mumbai, July 22: The RBI has allowed debit cardholders to swipe the plastic and withdraw cash at retail establishments across the country.        
	This means around 4.7 lakh retail establishments, including shops in malls, in the country will be able to function as mini-ATMs from were cash also can be picked up.        
	Initially, cash withdrawals from the point of sale (POS) terminals will be limited to Rs 1,000 per card per day.         
	POS terminals are machines deployed by banks in retail establishments to read debit or credit card information and enable customers to pay for purchases using plastic money.        
	The central banks notice was, however, silent on the date from which the plan becomes effective. Bankers said the process could begin in a couple of months.        
	Greater clarity could emerge next Tuesday when the RBI comes out with its first quarter review of the monetary policy.        
	The central bank said the cash withdrawal facility at merchant establishments should be made available after a process of due diligence. The facility will have to be extended irrespective of whether the cardholder makes a purchase or not. Banks have also been told to put in place a customer redress mechanism.        
	An official with a private bank said not all POS terminals would be able to provide the cash withdrawal facility. Initially, this facility could be offered at the big stores which are well equipped, he added.        
	If the concept catches on, the retailers will need to keep sufficient cash on hand at all times to avoid a run on their tills.        
	Kishore Biyani, who has retailing brands like Pantaloons and Big Bazar, said: I believe that retailers should operate as banks. This seems to be a first step towards that. I dont see a problem in handling customers who wish to avail of this facility as we have more than 30 to 40 check-out counters at our stores. In fact, the move may draw more potential customers into our stores.        
	According to RBI data, there were 4,70,237 POS terminals as of May 31 against 44,857 ATMs in the country.        
	The central bank said it had decided to permit cash withdrawal from POS terminals because debit card use at such points of sale had been growing sharply.         
	Retail consumers have been whipping out their debit cards more often than credit cards to pay for small purchases. The volume of debit card transactions has grown by about 45 per cent against 14 per cent for credit cards.         
	However, in absolute terms, the volume of credit card transactions amounts to Rs 65,355 crore  three-and-a-half times that of debit cards (Rs 18,547 crore).

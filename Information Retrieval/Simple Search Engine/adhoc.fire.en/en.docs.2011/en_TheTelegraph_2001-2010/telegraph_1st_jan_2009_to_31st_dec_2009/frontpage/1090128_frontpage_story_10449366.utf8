The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Time for cross-border union 
                                                                                                           Time for cross-border union 
  - Separatist leader Yasin Malik to marry Pakistani artist          MUZAFFAR RAINA                            Malik                                        
	Srinagar, Jan. 27: After courting aazaadi for 20 years, Yasin Malik is giving up his freedom  willingly.        
	The pro-freedom separatist leader is opposed to Kashmirs accession to Pakistan but is set to tie the knot with Mashaal Mullick, a Pakistani he met on one of his visits to the neighbouring country.        
	The Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front chief has already left for Islamabad for the cross-border union in strife-torn times.        
	Malik left for Islamabad yesterday. His nikaah will be solemnised in Islamabad in the next few days. We have plans to go there in a bus through the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad road, Maliks friend and JKLF leader Yasin Bhat said.        
	Maliks visit to Pakistan comes some 20 years after his first, though the purpose then was different: to receive arms training and start an armed insurgency in Kashmir.        
	Family sources said Malik, 42, met Mashaal, 28, an artist, during one of his visits to Pakistan and fell in love.         
	Mashaal is a painter and is pursuing a bachelors degree at London School of Economics, a family source said.        
	The marriage was to have taken place last year but had to be postponed following the Amarnath protests that saw Malik landing in jail for being one of the leaders spearheading the agitation.        
	The ring ceremony took place while Malik, who was released after the Assembly elections, was still in jail.        
	If aazaadi drives Malik, raw beauty of the feminine mystique and horrors of abject poverty inspire Mashaal, says a statement posted on her website.        
	I began watercolour paintings at the age of six and then moved to other media, including pastel, charcoal, and glass painting, says the daughter of the late M. Hussain Mullick, former chairman of the economics department at Islamabads Quaid-e-Azam University.        
	Her brother Haider is a foreign policy analyst in Washington whose focus is South Asia. Mother Rehana Hussein Mullick, the website statement says, is a former secretary-general of the Pakistan Muslim Leagues womens wing.        
	Maliks choice of an outsider had tongues wagging but JKLF leaders silenced critiques by claiming a Kashmiri connection. The girls family has roots in Kashmir, Maliks friend Bhat said.        
	The JKLF chief will be the third separatist leader in the state to marry outsiders, though there is a Kashmiri connection to each.        
	Hurriyat chairman Mirwaiz Umer Farooq is married to Sheeba, an American of Kashmiri origin. Peoples Conference chief Sajjad Lones wife Asma is the daughter of JKLF leader Amanullah Khan from the other part of Kashmir.        
	Malik had first visited Pakistan-ruled Kashmir in 1988 to receive arms training. He became JKLF chief commander following the death of his colleague Ishfaq Majeed in an encounter with security forces in 1990.        
	In 1995, the outfit, under his leadership, decided to give up armed struggle and fight politically for Kashmirs freedom after bitter clashes with rival Hizb-ul Mujahideen.

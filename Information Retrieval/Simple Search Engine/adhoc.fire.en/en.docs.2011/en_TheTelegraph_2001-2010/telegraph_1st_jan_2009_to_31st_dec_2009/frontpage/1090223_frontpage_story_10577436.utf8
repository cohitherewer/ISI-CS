          AJAY SUKUMARAN                                                    
	Bangalore, Feb. 22: The economic downturn is driving down house rentals in Indias IT capital, allowing more and more working people to move to cheaper houses or re-negotiate rents, striking better bargains with their landlords.        
	Residential rents have fallen by nearly 30 per cent in areas such as Jayanagar, a sought-after location for IT professionals in south Bangalore that saw land value climb nearly 300 per cent during the boom years.        
	Some realtors said part of the reason for the fall in rentals was that the rates were never reasonable during the bull run  but people, mostly new arrivals from other places, paid up. Now arrivals have fallen, many apartments are vacant, and the tenants cannot afford the high rents any more.        
	A freeze on recruitment by many firms has reduced the number of newcomers significantly, confirmed K. Rajagopal, a broker. Earlier, we would get 10-20 (clients new to Bangalore) per month.        
	Realtors said that over the past couple of months, they had received fewer enquiries for flats from new arrivals, but more inquiries for lower rentals from those already settled.        
	P. Prasad, who owns an apartment in Jayanagar, settled for a 20 per cent cut on a monthly rent of Rs 31,000 last month because his tenant, who works for a multinational firm, was willing to vacate if he didnt agree. We have to co-operate now, said Prasad, who was not keen on a tenant hunt again. A lot of houses are going vacant.        
	People are finding cheaper houses in the same localities, and within enclaves, because availability is higher, said Pankaj Malhotra, the proprietor of Golden Nest Realtors. There are many who are moving to another place of the same size at lower rent.        
	According to housing price index NHB Residex, of the National Housing Bank, realty prices in Bangalore had grown at an annual average of 21.6 per cent between 2002 and 2007. This was faster compared with Delhi, Mumbai and Calcutta, where rates rose by 20.4, 18 and 15.7 per cent, respectively. The prices grew faster in Bangalores suburbs than in central areas where rates were already high.        
	Things had become abnormally high, said Feroze Abdulla, the managing director of Feroze Estates and Properties. Whatever (rent) was unreasonable is being re-negotiated.        
	Malhotra said that even in affluent residential enclaves like Palm Meadows in Whitefield, residents were getting cheaper deals since house owners were undercutting each other. He, however, added that demand for high-value properties available at Rs 1.5 lakh a month, or more, was still good.        
	A large number of houses and apartments in peripheral localities such as Sarjapur Road and Marathahalli, which saw a construction boom, havent found takers because the rates are still high. But now, these will come down, said Abdulla.        
	The trend has hit office space, too. At least 12 office spaces have been vacated within 45 days in Jayanagar alone, said R. Amarnath, who runs Vani Estates, a consultancy.        
	However, the rental market has been less affected than sales and purchase markets, said Ashutosh Upadhyay, a director of Easysquarefeet.com, a real estate portal.

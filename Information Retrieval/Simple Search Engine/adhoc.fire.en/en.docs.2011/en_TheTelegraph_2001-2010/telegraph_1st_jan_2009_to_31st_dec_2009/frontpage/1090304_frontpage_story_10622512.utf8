The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Kumar: Owe it to driver
                                                                                                           Kumar: Owe it to driver
          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      Kumar Sangakkara                          
	Calcutta: Kumar Sangakkara, wholl be succeeding Mahela Jayawardene as Sri Lankas captain, took two calls (on his cellphone) from The Telegraph on Tuesday.        
	The first was around 11.40 am (IST), when the classy keeper-batsman said: Im fine... Were fine... Im heading for a meeting... Please try after an hour...        
	About an hour later, sounding more composed, Sangakkara had the following to say:  
	I was sitting somewhere in the middle of the team bus when, suddenly, shots were heard... Instinctively, we dived for the floor and a good many of us banged our heads in the process... Frankly, we didnt know what was going on... Its while I was on the floor that something struck me on the right shoulder... I had no way of knowing what, but I tried to stay calm, like my teammates... Things were flying around...        
	Actually, the driver saved us... He remained cool and, more importantly, kept driving till the bus reached the Gaddafi... But for his presence of mind in getting away from that area, one doesnt know what wouldve happened... I dont know his name, but my teammates and I are indebted to him...        
	Right now, Im about to have another check-up... Well be leaving (Pakistan) shortly... The specifics are being worked out... Im grateful to friends whove called and expressed their concern from, it seems, all over the world... It has been comforting and touching...

  - Calcutta researchers crack protection puzzle          G.S. MUDUR                             Partha Majumder                                        
	New Delhi, April 6: Scientists have resolved a long-standing puzzle about the human immune systems first line of defence against microbes by examining select genes of 175 slum-dwellers from eastern Calcutta.        
	A large genetic study by researchers at the Indian Statistical Institute and the Institute for Molecular Medicine, Calcutta, has indicated how the first barrier of protection against bugs  the innate immune system  has evolved over time.        
	The scientists studied a set of 12 genes that plays various roles in the innate immune system and compared genetic variations in the Calcutta residents with those found in Caucasian-American and African-American populations.        
	Their analysis shows that the variations were similar across the three populations, despite their diverse ethnicities. The findings of the study will be published in the US journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.        
	Whether you live in a place with a high load of microbes or in a relatively sanitised environment, the patterns of genetic variations in the innate immune system genes are similar, said Partha Majumder, team leader and head of the human genetics unit at the Indian Statistical Institute.         
	The genes associated with innate immunity do not tolerate mutations, Majumder told The Telegraph.        
	These findings make intuitive logic into scientific reality, said Vineeta Bal, a senior scientist at the National Institute of Immunology, New Delhi, who was not involved in the work but is herself studying innate immunity.        
	The study has provided fresh insights into the evolution of immunity genes in the 200th birth anniversary year of Charles Darwin and the 150th anniversary of the publication of his classic work on the origin of species.        
	Darwin showed that evolution at the anatomical level occurred by natural selection. This study shows it is now possible to study the mode and tempo of natural selection at the genetic level to see how genes evolve, Majumder said.        
	The Calcutta study has resolved a decade-long controversy about the innate immune system that scientists believe originated hundreds of millions of years ago, perhaps in the earliest amoebas and continues to protect humans.        
	The innate immune system with which the body recognises microbes and mounts early attacks has been hanging between two competing theories. Some scientists believe genes involved in innate immunity do not change, or mutate, over hundreds of generations because they are already optimised over evolutionary time scales to recognise signatures of bacteria, viruses, or protozoa.        
	But other scientists argued that innate immunity genes could by themselves evolve over time and the frequencies of mutations would be higher, and possibly different across different populations, depending on their exposure to microbes.        
	Such studies are best done by looking at populations in contrasting environments, Majumder said. The samples of people from Calcutta were likely to be exposed to high levels of infection because of poor quality of drinking water, or poor hygiene.        
	The findings of similar genetic variations across the three populations suggest that mutations that emerge by chance in the innate immunity genes are quickly removed from the population. The immune system of a person with mutations in these genes would be unable to recognise microbes efficiently and the individual would be at risk of infections, including potentially lethal infections.        
	People with such mutations will be more likely to die from infections before they are old enough to reproduce. Over time, such a process would weed out mutations from the general population.        
	NIIs Bal said the new study has provided hard evidence for something scientists would have expected to see. The innate immunity genes have persisted in diverse organisms -- from fish to flies to mice to humans, she said.        
	If the genes survived evolutionary changes, the implication is that mutations in these genes are detrimental for survival and hence should not be found in successive generations, Bal said. Humans, in this context, are survivors -- intuitively people should not show too many mutations in these genes.

	Goods carriers enter and exit no-entry zones in Calcutta as their owners and drivers please by paying police a monthly fee.         
	A slip of paper, which these owners call cards, containing the name and mobile phone number of the traffic sergeant who is their handler acts as their passport in these zones.         
	Two surveys conducted by The Telegraph at an interval of six months have yielded the same finding: that if a driver has a pass issued by any of the citys 14 traffic guards (the traffic police force for a zone is called a guard), he moves freely within its jurisdiction. A driver often has several passes issued by several traffic guards.         
	Theoretically, he could have 14 passes giving him a run of the city.         
	Dilip Banerjee, deputy commissioner, traffic, has said he has no knowledge of such a system but promises investigation if the allegation is found to be true.         
	The monthly fee is set according to the size of the vehicle, starting from Rs 600 to Rs 150, according to drivers and policemen The Telegraph has on tape.         
	In effect, the police are illegally collecting a congestion charge, which could easily have gone into the pocket of the administration if it had thought about it first.

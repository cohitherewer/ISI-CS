                                Keep smiling                            
	London, June 19: Britons should have plenty to smile about today June 19 as its officially the happiest day of 2009.         
	Psychologist Dr Cliff Arnall has devised a formula to pinpoint the day we are all most likely to feel the cheeriest.The former NHS psychologist and Cardiff University lecturer said people should forget credit crunch worries because the secret of happiness lies with things which are free.        
	Dr Arnall, 44, who runs the Feelconsultancy.com happiness clinics, said feel-good sensations are enjoying time with friends and loves ones, appreciating nature in the sunshine and looking forward to the weekend and a holiday.        
	His complicated mathematic formula is: + (N x S) + Cpm/T + He. Put simply, he gave values to each symbol and added being outdoors () to nature (N) multiplied by social interaction (S), added memories of childhood summers (Cpm) divided by the temperature (T), and added excitement about holidays (He).        
	British spirits, dampened by the credit crunch, have been boosted by the sunny start to summer, the longest days of the year with daylight until 10pm, the nearing of payday next Friday and optimism tennis star Andy Murray could win Wimbledon.        
	Dr Arnall, from Brecon in Powys, Wales, said: Peoples minds are on the credit crunch  but that doesnt take away from the equations primary factors, which are spending time with people you love and being outdoors in the warm weather.        
	The most important things you can do to be happy are free. People may be less able to afford other leisure activities but its free to walk in the park or paddle in a stream. It refreshes you and you forget your other worries.        
	And the most important thing in our lives are our relationships  and no amount of money can buy that.        
	Ive spoken to miserable multimillionaires and people who have no money but are very happy because they have amazing friends. Any psychologist, life coach or happiness expert will tell you that relationships with people are what makes you happy.

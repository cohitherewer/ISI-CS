                                                                                                           Neither classes nor masses
                                            
	The Bengal government on Saturday sought to take the catwalk from the classes to the masses but neither was at hand to soak up the experience. The fashion show was a government initiative organised by the West Bengal Khadi and Village Industries Commission at Milon Mela        
	Misses        
	Fashion designers like Anamika Khanna, Agnimitra Paul, Kiran Uttam Ghosh and Sharbari Dutta figured on the invitee list but not at the event        
	Hits        
	Actor Prosenjit and budding designer Tejas Gandhi made it. So did employees of the khadi board and textile directorates, and the mela organisers and their families        
	Unsung winners        
	The saris, shirts and skirts in silk, kantha and taant, with batik and embroidery, did live up to expectations        
	Promise        
	Bringing designers and artisans on the same platform to popularise the use of khadi and handloom textile        
	Performance        
	Surprise treat for workers inspecting the sanitation and water supply at the Milon Mela grounds        
	Showstopper        
	Actress Locket Chatterjee (in picture draped in a handwoven white and red-bordered garad sari).         
	The showstoppers name was announced as she took the stage  a fashion show faux pas by the emcee        
	Last word        
	What used to be a class item, Ive made into a mass item, said Mohd Salim, the CPM leader wearing the hat of the chairman of the West Bengal Khadi and Village Industries Commission.        
	Asked why the masses were missing, Salim said: With one show, I cant expect revolution but at least its drawn attention

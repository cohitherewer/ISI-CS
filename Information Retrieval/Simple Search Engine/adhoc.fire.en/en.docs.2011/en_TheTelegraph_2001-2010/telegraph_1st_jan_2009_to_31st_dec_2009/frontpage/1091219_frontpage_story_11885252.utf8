          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            india bound?                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 18: Bullet trains running at up to 350km an hour, a railway-run TV channel, multi-lingual magazines for passengers, punctuality and zero accidents  they could all become reality by 2020, according to the railways.        
	Bullet trains running at 250-350kmph between Howrah and Haldia, Pune and Ahmedabad, Delhi and Amritsar, Delhi and Patna, and Hyderabad and Chennai are part of the Vision 2020 document tabled in Parliament today.        
	The railways also aim to raise the speed of regular passenger trains to 160-200kmph from 110-130kmph. If this happens, the document says, Delhi-Calcutta and Delhi-Mumbai will become an overnight service.        
	It looks at the possibility of increasing advertising revenues using freight and passenger trains (both inside and outside), multi-lingual magazines for passengers and merchandising opportunities for ticket to foodstuff and other materials served on trains.

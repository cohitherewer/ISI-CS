          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 3: Investigations into the multi-crore hawala transaction and illegal investment case involving former chief minister Madhu Koda today led the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to the offices of Emaar MGF, the construction giant involved with Commonwealth Games projects in the national capital.         
	ED sources confirmed that at least 10 offices of the company, a joint venture between Emaar Properties of Dubai and MGF Development, were raided in connection with the Koda scam. The raids were mostly in the National Capital Region.         
	The raids come just five months after the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) bailed out Emaar MGF, the developers of the Commonwealth Games Village, with a Rs 760-crore package.         
	Sources said the raiding team recovered documents that showed Kodas associates on the board of some Emaar group companies. Bikash Sinha, one of Kodas associates now in judicial custody, had told investigators that he and some others had invested in the company on behalf of Koda.         
	ED officials also raided the homes and offices of some board members of the company in the capital who, they alleged, were directly linked to the scam and helped Koda pilfer money out of the country.         
	The raids were in connection with violation of FEMA regulations and diverting money abroad. We are also investigating if the company brought money into the country in violation of foreign exchange rules, and used the funds to buy agricultural land, a source at the directorate told The Telegraph.         
	Incidentally, Emaar MGF had brought the largest foreign investment in real estate in India in 2005.         
	Another man who is believed to have led ED to crackdown on Emaar is Kodas close aide Devendra Mukhia who surrendered on November 9. Mukhia, a familiar face in the real estate hub of Noida, is known among builders in the area as a troubleshooter and fixer. Investigations are on to see if Mukhias name appears in any document found in the Emaar offices relating to real estate bought in the area for Koda.         
	Sources also said another accused in the case, Sanjay Chowdhary, the suspected frontman for all alleged dubious deals of the former chief minister and who left for Dubai as soon the ED registered a case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act in the multi-crore scam, was also involved with the company. Investigators believe that he facilitated the inclusion of Kodas men in the board of the company that has its tentacles in Dubai. ED sources said Chowdhary could also be on the board of Emaar. ED will soon move court for revoking Chowdharys passport.         
	Commonwealth Games Organising Committee officials said the raids would not threaten construction work at the Games Village. I dont see a problem with the continuation of work at the Games Village site. The company has many other projects and they may have problems with those, CWG has nothing to do with it, said COO, CWG, Vijay Kumar Gautam.

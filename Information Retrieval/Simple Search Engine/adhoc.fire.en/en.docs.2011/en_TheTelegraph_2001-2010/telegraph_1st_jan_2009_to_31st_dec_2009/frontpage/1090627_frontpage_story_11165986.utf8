                                                                                                           Battle for Kadashole
										      Sujan Dutta of The Telegraph, who witnessed the gun battle, reports from the field                                    
	Central forces on Friday   engaged the Maoists in by 
  far the fiercest firefight in the   Lalgarh operation, pushing through territory from where Bengal police were beaten back last week and reaching within 6km of Ramgarh, the suspected rebel hub.																							   
	The site of Friday rsquo;s   gun fight was the mouth of the forest in Kadashole, 8km from the Goaltore base camp from where 10 companies mdash; six central and four state, totalling 1,000 personnel mdash; set out in the morning. The forces came across several bombs on the way. The Maoists detonated some, too, but most went off before the forces were within range. On Saturday, the forces are expected to try to complete the march to Ramgarh.  
	A rusty wired-up can covered with newsprint sits in the middle of the road on the edge of the Kadashole forest. Battalion commandant Pankaj skirts around it and instructs his men to follow suit but a young man is impatient: Insas rifle in one hand and devil-may-care in the mind, he kicks it away.  
	He lives, intact and unharmed, as do we.        
	Another bloody dud. The fifth.        
	Pankaj laughs. He asks his lieutenant to withdraw to Kadashole but first secure the flanks. The lieutenant sidles up and asks: We have just come through this village  Kadashole  can you tell me where the people are?        
	The security forces captured territory  eight kilometres of it  today in the operations to reclaim Lalgarh without knowing where the people are. Kadashole, the village of about 350 households that the forces entered and set up camp in, was deserted but for the very elderly and just about three other families.        
	The CRPF battalion lieutenant was mystified just like his troopers. But theirs is not to reason why. Tomorrow well go to Lalgarh if we are asked to, he said. The young man who kicked the can that could have been a bomb came along and said: Do teen ko to marna hi hai is taraf ya us taraf (Two or three have to get killed on this side or the other).        
	Thankfully, nothings bloody. The dud that was kicked was just another calling card the Maoists left behind without camouflage. If you can read the lettering, it says: We were here.        
	This is within five minutes of a firefight and the nerves are taut. Expletives strive to keep pace with bullets. There is no time or space for decency here. None of Bengals convoluted rhetoric about taking on the rebels politically. At this cutting edge, it is kill or be killed.         
	For the record, the 66th battalion of the Central Reserve Police Force today cut through the Pingboni border and advanced about 6.5km to Kadashole in Bengals operation to reclaim Lalgarh. This is along a northern axis of the area of operations.        
	Pingboni was where the Bengal Armed Police and the Eastern Frontier Rifles were beaten back by the rebel militia last Saturday even as the security forces pushed through the Pirakata-Bhimpur axis  a little to the south  to Lalgarh police station.        
	The 66th reached Goaltore last afternoon. The battalion was originally stationed near Patna. The 66th has been in operations against Naxalites in Malkangiri in Orissa.        
	The platoon commander says Malkangiri was different. In Malkangiri, he says, the Maoists stood and fought. Here, they plant bombs and vanish.        
	**** they think they can rule the country with such kuchcha bombs? the platoon commander goes on. His battalion commandant is out of earshot.        
	The advance party of the 66th marched through Pingboni, mostly off the road. There were two sections covering the flanks. The road was suspected to be mined  the suspicion turned out to be true  but there were a lot of duds.        
	There were two explosions that were loud and could have been lethal. One exploded before the security forces reached the spot. The Maoists timed it too early.        
	The second was an improvised explosive device. The Maoists armed squad did not appear to have the wherewithal to embed mines into metalled roads and cover them up. So they used implements to direct the impact of an explosion.        
	In this instance, they had used a cutaway from a telephone pole about three feet in length. An anti-sabotage team that followed  and was not with the advance party  defused it near a bridge in two hours after five tries.        
	Bengal polices deputy inspector-general (CID), Siddhi Nath Gupta, and the CRPFs DIG, B.R. Kamath, are with the platoon that is going along the road.        
	Gupta gets a phone call from a superior  it is not clear whether the senior officer belongs to the CRPF or Bengal police. Yes, sir, Gupta says. We are advancing towards Kadashole, kuchh mines mila hai (we have found some mines). I have called the BD (bomb disposal squad).        
	Even as Gupta is talking on the phone, commandant Pankaj instructs his men over the walkie-talkie: Fire control order till direction of fire is known. The troops are expecting fire. This is about three hours before reaching Kadashole.        
	The media is held back behind a bridge till the bomb disposal squad does its job. It is a long while. But before that Gupta and Kamath  Bengal police and the CRPF  have an argument. Gupta is speaking on the phone and talking to Kamath at the same time.        
	Kamath is worried about casualties among his men. He suggests that with the mines being found, it is advisable to watch instead of going ahead right away. That is probably what the phone call is about.        
	No, Sir, I will not pull one company back, Gupta tells the superior on the phone.        
	The orders probably are to draw back if the road is mined and if opposition is estimated to take casualties.         
	Kamath, the CRPF DIG, asks whats up.         
	Gupta replies: I am on the spot and I will take the decisions. How can we decide what we should do on the basis of telephone instructions!        
	But why is Gupta  the Bengal police are supposed to lead  going ahead without a mine-protected vehicle (MPV) in front? That was the drill when the forces went through the Jhitka forest to the Lalgarh police station last Saturday. Gupta replies: We want to sanitise the road.        
	Twenty minutes later, the MPV is called up. But it is asked to stay at the bridge.        
	Most of the troops are on the flanks as they near Murakati village on the left. It is not on the road. A blast and a column of smoke and then a burst of automatic gunfire.         
	On the other flank, beyond a depression, about five figures are running away into the distance. There is more firing.         
	One jawan on the road tells his officer: Teen magazine to ho gaya. A magazine in an AK has 20 bullets. This is the first firefight.        
	There is another. That is just after Kadashole. The CRPF advance party has to lie down as forces behind them fire.         
	They have spotted between eight and 10 people in civilian clothes kneeling on the road that leads to the forest, as if they are doing something to the road. On either side of the road, the land undulates.        
	Forces behind the advance party spot the men first. They fire  over the head of the advance party. The advance party has to hit dirt.        
	The suspected Maoists retreat while firing from single-barrel and double-barrel guns that were said to be .303 or country-made. The CRPF advance party fires away right up to the edge of the forest.        
	The forces are asked not to advance further. The terrain here is so treacherous that it is difficult to distinguish between friend and foe. In between, there is the forest. Then there is another road to Lalgarh.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Cough therapy for Singh
                                                                                                           Cough therapy for Singh
          G.S. MUDUR                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 25: Asawari Pages gentle requests are likely to cause some additional discomfort to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh but, doctors say, shes succeeding in getting him to cough  morning and evening, at least twice a day.         
	The physiotherapist at the Asian Heart Institute, Mumbai, is among a medical team trying to help Singh recuperate from his 11-hour-long coronary artery bypass surgery.        
	A cough is a ubiquitous reflex action of the body aimed at expelling excess fluid or secretions, tiny dust particles and even microbes from breathing passages. After a major surgery, inducing a cough is a key process during recovery, doctors said. But its also much harder to cough after surgery because of the pain, said a senior cardiothoracic surgeon. Sometimes, simple movements may be painful, but a cough involves rapid movements of the chest region. This can cause extreme discomfort.         
	After a major surgery, cough is usually weak and not effective enough to clear the airways. This can lead to accumulation of fluid in the lungs which may indirectly increase the risk of infection, a doctor said. Bleeding and infection are key risks after a major surgery.         
	But the Prime Minister has been responding to the physiotherapy. He is coughing when requested -- and doing it pretty well, a senior doctor at AIIMS told The Telegraph. She (Page) is doing an excellent job.         
	Page is chief co-ordinator at the AHI and specialises in cardiovascular and respiratory physiotherapy. A team member from the AHI said the Prime Minister is receiving medication to alleviate post-surgical pain. These drugs are likely to reduce the pain that might be triggered by the process of coughing.        
	Doctors said they plan to initiate the next level of rehabilitation during recuperation -- getting the Prime Minister to first sit up on his bed, then stand, and then take his first steps after surgery sometime tomorrow.        
	A cardiothoracic surgeon who was not associated with the surgery on Saturday said a patient who has previously experienced a bypass procedure will know what (level of discomfort) to expect after surgery. Such awareness and a desire to overcome the discomfort can help in fast recovery.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | whats on your mind?
                                                                                                           Whats on your mind?
										      Lost jobs, stagnant income, spiralling   food prices, anaemic exports and dented   investor confidence. Rarely has the   so-called layperson been affected so much   by economic factors  at play from without   and within the country  as today when   finance minister Pranab Mukherjee rises   to present the Union budget.  The budget is little more than an accounting procedure  the finance minister places   before Parliament the governments income and expenditure statements for the year   gone by and makes projections for the   coming 12 months. But over the years,   the annual ritual has come to raise   expectations among people.  Devadeep Purohit of The Telegraph   reads the pulse of anticipation beating   around this budget                                    
	My budget        
	The finance minister will agree that balancing the familys budget is not an easy task when prices of food and other essentials are shooting through the roof. The recent increase in oil prices have added to the burden.        
	Every hike in oil price is followed by another spiral of price rises. This means another round of consumption cuts to balance the budget, says Rupa Roy, the wife of an employee with a foreign bank.         
	The general price level in the economy depends on several factors ranging from global trends to local supplies. Still, the budget can have an impact on prices if it invokes tools like modifying indirect taxes.         
	Can Mukherjee assuage the concerns of homemakers who work hard to balance the familys budget?         
	My income        
	While most of the world was panting last year, the Indian economy grew by 6.7 per cent. But the downturn fears triggered salary freezes  cuts in some cases  for many private sector employees who have grown used to the idea of annual increments for the past few boom years.         
	Smart investors, who prefer the equities market to augment income, watched helplessly as falling stock prices eroded their capital.        
	Rural India was promised at least 100 days of work but many people only got the job card and not the cash that could have fuelled demand.         
	The salaried class is looking for relief that will augment income. Not many are expecting Mukherjee to cut tax rates but hopes are riding on additional tax exemptions. Mukherjee also has the chance to breathe fresh life into the New Pension Scheme, which has so far received only a lukewarm response. Also, will the finance minister expand the scope and scale of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme?         
	My job        
	Recruitment freeze is the buzzword in one of the fastest growing economies in the world.         
	Two government surveys  conducted by the ministry of labour and employment and by the commerce and industry ministry  revealed job losses in several sectors between end-2008 and early 2009.         
	Against this backdrop, the economic survey suggests lowering of deficit targets (which means forget about fiscal stimuli) and sweeping changes in labour laws (which means hire and fire at employers will). If Mukherjee takes these two suggestions seriously, more trouble awaits the common man.         
	Fiscal stimulus  capable of generating a huge multiplier effect  has endeared itself to policy makers across the world to beat downturn blues.         
	The mood in the job market will depend to a great extent on Mukherjees pronouncements. Will he announce special sops for sectors like information technology to help them create and also save jobs? Will he give the economy a big push?         
	My life         
	Good roads and availability of electricity are key elements in the quality of life for the citizenry.        
	The economic survey has pointed out that against the targeted 9.1 per cent, growth in total power generation stood at 2.7 per cent last year. Roads didnt fare well, either, because of a number of reasons, from lack of funds to poor co-ordination among agencies.         
	A full-fledged roadmap with a hefty allocation to improve power and road infrastructure can bring about a significant change in quality of life. Besides, the expansionary effect of investments in these sectors can jumpstart the economy, said a city-based economist.         
	Will Mukherjee give priority to infrastructure?         
	My future         
	India appears to have more or less weathered the global financial meltdown but recent trends the world over  run on banks, liquidation of behemoths and collapse of financial systems  have made Indians wary of savings and investments avenues.         
	The economic survey  a statement of intent that need not be followed in letter and spirit by the government  has suggested reforms such as raising the foreign direct investment limit in insurance from 26 per cent to 49 per cent, allowing smoother entry to foreign banks and proportionate voting rights in private banks.        
	While the advocates of reforms feel opening up will deepen the market and ease the flow of credit to various sectors, the unregulated excesses blamed for the chaos abroad have spread some concern here, too.         
	I dont understand all the nuances. I just want my money to be safe and secure, said Bhaskar Roy, a 35-year-old employee with a multinational.         
	Keeping in mind the interests of such people who have put their lifes savings in banks and insurance companies, Mukherjee will have to take a call on the tricky issue of financial reforms.       
	Be patient  Budget speeches, scheduled to start at 11 in the morning, tend to go on and on. Have patience.  Snap to attention and cock your ears when the minister starts reading out Part B of the budget speech, which includes tax proposals. In the short run, these will affect you the most  
	Statutory warning   Bad news usually comes   last when you are least   inclined to listen carefully.

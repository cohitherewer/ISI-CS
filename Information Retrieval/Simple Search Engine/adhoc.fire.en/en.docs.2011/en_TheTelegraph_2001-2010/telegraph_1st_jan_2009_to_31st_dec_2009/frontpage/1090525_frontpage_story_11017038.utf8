          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             Yechury                                  
	New Delhi, May 24: Amid rising internal murmurs that breaking ties with the UPA contributed to the CPMs worst electoral showing in four decades, senior politburo member Sitaram Yechury has said both collective leadership and individual responsibility will come up for review at the partys central committee meeting next month.         
	Of course, it (the issue of leadership) will come, Yechury told CNN-IBN in an interview aired today. Of course, it will be discussed. Remember, a communist party functions by what we call the Leninist principles of organisation, where it is collective functioning with individual responsibility.         
	Pressed on the issue of CPM general secretary Prakash Karat taking responsibility for mistakes and relinquishing leadership, Yechury was more circumspect and maintained it was not an issue of individuals.        
	it will not be on the basis of who is going to resign or not  that is not the issue. The issue is what are the mistakes, why were they committed and how can they be corrected. The central committee, as I said, will comprehensively review. Beyond that I cannot go today.         
	Karats decision to break away from the UPA over the nuclear deal has openly been named as one of the reasons for the CPMs debacle by defeated party MPs from Bengal. Many in the party believe that Karats push to pull out of the UPA brought about the Congress-Trinamul tie-up which trounced the CPM in Bengal.         
	Besides, there is also apparent divergence within the party on the manner in which the general secretary championed the third front.        
	Subtle, but firm, differences over the third front strategy came out openly in two separate pieces Karat and Yechury wrote last week in a party mouthpiece.        
	While Karat appeared convinced there is space in the polity for a viable non-Congress secular formation, Yechury seemed to indicate that given the fickle nature of most parties involved, it was tough to take ideological and political cohesion beyond the Left bloc.Yechury also hinted in the interview to the television channel that party elder Jyoti Basu had cautioned the CPM leadership against breaking with the UPA.

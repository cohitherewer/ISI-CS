                                                                                                           AI strike threat by executive pilots 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 25: A band of Air India executive pilots, led by captain V.K. Bhalla, has threatened a wildcat strike in protest against the move to cut productivity-linked incentives by up to half.         
	The two pilots unions  ICPA, representing those from the former Indian Airlines, and IPG, its counterpart from the erstwhile Air India  have not issued any statement or notice favouring a strike.         
	An executive pilot who holds the rank of deputy general manager has given the call for a wildcat strike in Mumbai, unsupported by pilots unions. We are not taking this seriously as executives are in any case not supposed to go on strike, said an Air India board member.        
	The state-run Air India, which has accumulated a loss of Rs 7,200 crore, recently announced a series of cost-cutting measures, which include reducing the productivity-linked incentives to pilots and engineers.        
	Earlier, Jet Airways pilots had gone on a strike protesting the sacking of their leaders for setting up an unrecognised union.        
	Jet pilots had last December accepted a 50 per cent salary cut after the airline reported huge losses.        
	In Mumbai, Bhalla, a representative for the executive pilots, said: The executive pilots have taken a decision to go on strike because nobody is in a state of mind to work due to the salary cuts. Starting now, we will not work.

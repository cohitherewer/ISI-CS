	Ranchi, Dec. 27: JMM supremo Shibu Soren will be sworn in as chief minister on December 30 with Governor K. Sankaranarayanan administering the oath of office and secrecy at the Morabadi ground.        
	Sorens 11 ministerial colleagues are likely to be sworn in the same day as well with the power sharing formula with alliance partners now final.        
	Accompanied by son Hemant, Soren today met the governor at Raj Bhavan in the afternoon and expressed his desire to form a government in the state. The governor promptly acceded to his request.        
	Yesterday, Soren staked claim to form a government with the help of BJP, Ajsu and JD(U). Jharkhand Janadhikar Manch leader Bandhu Tirkey and Rashtriya Kalyan Paksha MLA Chamra Linda too offered support. No other party or front has so far staked claim to form a government. The Election Commission has already notified constitution of the Vidhan Sabha, said a Raj Bhavan spokesman.        
	Speaking about the power sharing formula, sources said apart from the chief minister, the JMM would have three more representatives in the council of ministers. JMM legislators Hemlal Murmu, Teklal Mahto and Haji Hussain Ansari were said to be frontrunners for ministerial berths.        
	Ajsu supremo Sudesh Mahto too was likely to be sworn in, along with his colleagues, Ramgarh MLA Chandra Prakash Choudhary and Lohardaga legislator Kamal Kishore Bhagat. Insiders said Mahto was likely to be deputy chief minister and could also head the home department along with several other important departments.        
	The Assembly speakers chair would probably go to BJP, which would also have four more representatives in the council of ministers. Raghubar Das, Neelkanth Singh Munda, Arun Mandal and Baijnath Ram were reportedly being considered as ministerial candidates.        
	Senior BJP member C.P. Singh was a strong contender for the Speakers chair. Yesterday, Singhs supporters had vandalised the BJP office, demanding that Singh be made minister and Das, the Speaker.        
	Sudha Choudhary of JD(U) was likely to be the lone female member in the Soren cabinet. A first-timer in the House, she beat veteran Radha Krishna Kishore to get to the Assembly.        
	There may be a few minor changes in the projected names, but the power sharing formula is almost final, said a senior BJP leader who played a key role in striking deals with JMM and other alliance partners.        
	In the evening, Congress state president Pradeep Kumar Balmuchu held a meeting with senior party colleagues to analyse poll results and discuss future plans. The Congress legislature party meeting will be held on December 30, where our partys new leader in the House will be elected, Balmuchu added.

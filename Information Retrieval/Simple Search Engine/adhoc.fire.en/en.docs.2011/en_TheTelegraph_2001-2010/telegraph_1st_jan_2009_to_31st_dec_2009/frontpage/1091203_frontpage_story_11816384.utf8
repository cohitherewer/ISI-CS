The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Dhaka helps, fugitive Ulfa boss in Delhi
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Dhaka helps, fugitive Ulfa boss in Delhi
          OUR BUREAU                                              
	Dec. 2: Ulfa chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa was tonight flown to Delhi after he was pushed back to Tripura from Bangladesh, the two neighbours pulling off the biggest unde- clared deportation of a most-wanted fugitive in recent memory.        
	The stunning high-value transfer, which neither side would confirm on record because of the absence of an extradition treaty, is being seen as an unparalleled goodwill gesture before the visit of Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to India on December 19.        
	Rajkhowa heads the political wing of the banned Ulfa that had been blamed for several terror strikes in Assam, including blasts last month in which at least eight people were killed.        
	With the capture of Rajkhowa, one of the five founder leaders of Ulfa, its entire political leadership is now in custody, fuelling speculation that the cornered outfit could soon agree to hold talks without the usual key condition of sovereignty being on the agenda.        
	 Union home minister P. Chidambaram, without making any mention of the detention of Rajkhowa, today told the Rajya Sabha: It is quite likely that the Ulfa leadership will make a political statement in a few days. If they wish to talk, we are ready, provided they formally abjure violence and drop the demand of sovereignty.        
	The status of Rajkhowa is shrouded in mystery. In order to spare Bangladesh compulsions to explain the transfer, India could officially claim that the Ulfa leader crossed over and surrendered or turned up for talks.         
	National security adviser M.K. Narayanan said: I dont think he (Rajkhowa) has been arrested. If at all it will happen, probably he may surrender.        
	Sources said the 52-year-old Rajkhowa was picked up by Bangladeshi security agencies last week and kept in a secured location in Dhaka.         
	Along with Rajkhowa, Ulfa publicity secretary Apurba Baruah was flown to Delhi. Sources said the two were pushed across the Akhaura checkpoint, 6km west of Agartala on the border, by Bangladesh. The two were flown from Tripura by a special aircraft to Delhi and later transferred to a safe house.        
	Pushed back is a phrase security agencies use when fugitives are detained in foreign countries and sent over in the absence of formal treaties. The need for an extradition treaty comes into play only if a suspect is formally arrested.        
	Sources in Guwahati said officials from external intelligence agency RAW had visited Bangladesh to interrogate Rajkhowa.        
	Another most-wanted fugitive from the Northeast, Ranjan Daimary, has been detained in Bangladesh but not been transferred. Daimary is the chief of the National Democratic Front of Boroland (anti-talks faction).        
	A Lashkar-e-Toiba operative, Nazir Tarian Dabede, was handed over by the BSF to Meghalaya police this morning. Nazir, said to be from Kerala but suspected to have been hiding in Bangladesh, is an accused in the 2005 attack on the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore.        
	The implications of the unofficial transfers are far-reaching, not the least because Bangladeshi territory was being used as a staging post by assorted extremist groups, including some supported by Pakistan, to launch terror strikes on India.         
	An interim military regime and subsequently Hasina, the India-friendly leader who won a landslide victory in the Bangladesh elections, had tried to crack down on such outfits.         
	Unprecedented co-operation from Bangladesh has led to a series of breakthroughs recently. On November 5, Ulfas foreign secretary Sasha Choudhury and finance secretary Chitrabon Hazarika were pushed into India.        
	The Ulfa military chief, Paresh Barua, is still at large with reports suggesting he has fled Bangladesh and is flitting among China, Myanmar and Thailand.        
	Rajkhowas transfer came on a day the Indian and Bangladeshi home secretaries concluded talks in Delhi. Treaties to tackle terrorism and drug trafficking and exchange of prisoners were more or less finalised.

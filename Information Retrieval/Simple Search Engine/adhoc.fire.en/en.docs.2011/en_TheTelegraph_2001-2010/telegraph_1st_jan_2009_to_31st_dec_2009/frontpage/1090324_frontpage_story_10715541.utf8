	Calcutta, March 23: Down with CPM, long live CPMs policies.        
	Mamata Banerjees manifesto for the general election features more than one leaf from the CPMs book, echoing Prakash Karats party on pet themes ranging from rhetoric against globalisation, big capital, divestment and privatisation to extolling the virtues of the state sector.        
	Which means: tails Karat wins, heads Karat wins, too  at least in championing his causes in Parliament. If the Left fails to get enough MPs elected this time from Bengal, he need not lose too much sleep. The Trinamul Congress MPs should do the needful  if they stick to the policies listed in the partys manifesto released by Mamata today. (See chart)        
	The 83-page manifesto, which does take care to underscore the misdeeds of the Left in Bengal, could not but help parrot the CPM on a subject close to the average comrades heart. Globalisation is necessary but it is also necessary, even more important, to develop local resources and skills, Mamatas book points out.        
	On foreign direct investment  a red rag to the CPM till compulsions of power made the party discover its virtues  Mamatas manifesto mentions what documents of the CPMs 17th party congress in 2005 did.         
	No foreign capital in sectors other than high-quality technology and other industries indispensable for the country, Mamata said.        
	She also dug out one of the CPMs old demands by saying that 50 per cent of central taxes should go to the states because of limited resources but major responsibilities for development work.        
	On retail  a hot button issue in Bengal and most of the rest of the country  Mamata has sided with the official Left. Stop entry of big capital  domestic or foreign  in retail sector, she demanded in her manifesto. This is what Karat, not necessarily Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee -- would want in an ideal India.        
	Mamatas opposition to divestment in public sector enterprises should be music to Left ears. There should be no divestment of public sector enterprises. Instead, state enterprises have to be protected, the manifesto asserts.        
	Asked about the similarities with the CPMs policies, Trinamul state president and MLA Subrata Bakshi said: Some people consider us a regional party but ours is a national party. Now our critics will stop calling us a regional party in the light of national issues we have highlighted in the manifesto.        
	Trinamul sources said the manifesto reflected the opinion of Naxalite leaders like Purnendu Bose and Dola Sen who are now allied with Mamata. But the course Mamata has followed over the past few years is hardly different from the trajectory of the CPM when it was in the Opposition  the high points of her career often owing much to the brand of street politics perfected to an art by the Left party.        
	Mamatas manifesto does not lack good intentions. No land can be forcibly acquired for industry and blacklisted investors should be barred from investing, the document says, criticising the state government for acquiring land through coercion. But the manifesto does not mention how industry will be hosted in a state where most of the available land is fertile.        
	Mamata maintains that agriculture and industry should grow side by side. Agriculture must not be sacrificed at the altar of industry. Both should grow like twins, the manifesto says. The Trinamul Congress wants industry but not at the cost of poor farmers. We want to pursue a pragmatic industrial policy free from the shackles of red tape.        
	A noble concept but the manifesto does not address the issue of diminishing returns from land.        
	 The document also stresses on building all-party consensus before acquiring land for industry to win investors confidence  conveniently forgetting the initial reluctance to take part in talks on Singur and the numerous flip-flops when discussions were eventually held.        
	The manifesto opposes special economic zones as they cause environment pollution  this from a party that is instrumental in holding up a judicial initiative to clean up the air by banning poison-spewing vehicles.        
	Mamata favoured the formation of a land bank for industrial purpose and demanded that a white paper be published on the projects approved and implemented and the total investment for industries between 1991 and 2008. This is a constructive suggestion as several complaints  both at the central and state levels  have spoken about the lack of transparency on the subject.        
	The manifesto voices its opposition to recruitment on contract and retrenchment of government employees  a stand that should strike a chord in these times of economic downturn and job insecurity.        
	The Trinamul document demanded that construction of shopping malls across Bengal be stopped.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Unfurled: sari secret 
                                                                                                           Unfurled: sari secret 
  - Freida too young for nine yards of cloth          AMIT ROY                            Freida Pinto                                        
	Los Angeles, Feb. 20: Now we know why Freida Pinto, the lovely Latika in Slumdog Millionaire, has not been wearing saris to high-profile events in the West as many Indian designers had been hoping she would do in the service of Mother Mumbai.        
	Questions about the 24-year-olds sartorial preferences were raised when she wore a pink Oscar de la Renta to Bafta in London  and looked great in it, the experts concurred.        
	Now, in an interview with the fashion critic of the Los Angeles Times, the hottest Indian girl of the moment has come clean.         
	Taken to a sari shop in Little India, as Artesia, a suburb of Los Angeles with a cluster of Indian shops, is nicknamed, Freida confessed all.        
	I dont wear saris, she admitted, scanning the colourful yardage. I feel Im too young.        
	On a tour of local shops, Freida was accompanied by the fashion critic Booth Moore.        
	The big secret was let out when Freida headed for Sona Chaandi, the mother of all sari shops on Pioneer Boulevard, which caters to Gwen Stefani and other celeb Indophiles.         
	Inside, room after room is filled with saris, which run up to $995, as well as traditional Indian pants, tunic and scarf ensembles. Theres also a beauty salon attached that offers threading and mehendi body art.        
	Freida is game to play dress-up, so in come saleswomen carrying saris by the arm loads, shimmering with beads and embroidery.        
	Freida settles on a turquoise and gold brocade, which owner Mala Malani swirls around her in a flash of colour, adding a yellow gold-and-topaz suite of jewellery.        
	By now, Freida was playacting as she pulls the sheer fabric suggestively over her head.        
	Then Jamal is going to take it off, she says to gales of laughter, referring to her romantic partner in Slumdog.        
	The paper seized on Freida because she was being being courted by designers.        
	Back in India, Freida was a jeans and T-shirt kind of girl, but now designers are lining up to dress her. Shes worn Christian Lacroix haute couture, Zac Posen, Oscar de la Renta and Marchesa.        
	As to what she thinks of Bollywood, the answer from the girl born in Mumbai into a family from Mangalore was not a lot. In India, its hard to find a project because most of it is Bollywood, which is very exaggerated, she said. Most of what they make is over-the-top escapist and life isnt always so escapist. I realised what I wanted to do was connect with people, not seem unattainable or untouchable.        
	The paper noted: Malani offers tea and snacks, even a free sari. But Pinto leaves empty-handed.        
	The fashion critic, brought up possibly on the novel, The Devil Wears Prada, could not resist a dig. Back in the car, I ask her what she really wants  a Chanel purse, maybe?        
	Something Prada... or a watch, she says, thinking. No, no. Ive got it  Harry Winston! Yep, shes learning fast.

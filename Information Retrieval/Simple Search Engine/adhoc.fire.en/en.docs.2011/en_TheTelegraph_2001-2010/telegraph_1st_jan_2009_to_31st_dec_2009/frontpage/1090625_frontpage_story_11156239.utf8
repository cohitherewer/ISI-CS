                                                                                                           Abracadabra: the task force
          A STAFF REPORTER       
	Calcutta, June 24: A great mystery that perplexed the Bengal cabinet has been solved.        
	A task force to develop tribal regions such as Lalgarh had come into being only in December  a month after Maoists declared the area out of bounds for the government.        
	Not that the force could have made much of a difference even if the boycott was not in place. It did not work properly in the intervening months, the chief secretary conceded today, promising to revive the effort on Monday.  
	The revelation explains why chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees reference yesterday to such a task force was greeted with incredulity by some of his cabinet colleagues.        
	The chief minister had mentioned the task force and said it had spent Rs 13 crore when some colleagues questioned the development record in the tribal belt. Some sceptical ministers said they had never heard of such a force.        
	Bhattacharjee should forgive his colleagues: soon after the force was formed in December, it went into virtual hibernation because an occupational hazard called elections came along.        
	The task force could not work properly because of the elections and so we are reviving it, chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said today.         
	It is not clear how the general election stymied the task force -- the model code of conduct, which in any case does not affect ongoing projects, kicked in only on March 7.         
	The bemused ministers who questioned their chief minister should take Chakrabarti for his word. No one will know better than the chief secretary because he is the chairman of the task force which was threatening to assume the shadowy proportions of the Cobra force the government is now relying on to tackle the Lalgarh problem.        
	More state secrets on the benign but bashful task force: the other members include the principal secretary to the chief minister and secretaries in the departments of irrigation, animal husbandry, health and western zone development.         
	And the mandate? Hear it from Chakrabarti. Provide drinking water, ensure proper irrigation, create employment opportunities for tribal people through training programmes and set up schools, colleges and hostels.        
	The task force did execute some projects but we are trying to do much more, he added. The last meeting of the panel was held around two and a half months ago.        
	Chakrabarti, who visited Lalgarh today, indirectly suggested that certain sections of the government had failed to deliver. Even if sections of the government machinery had failed to deliver, this is no way to protest, he said.        
	He also appeared to blame the agitation for some of the problems, saying no development work could be done in the past five months because of the unrest.

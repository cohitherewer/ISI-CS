The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Contempt notice slapped on DYFI over Maidan rally 
                                                                                                           Contempt notice slapped on DYFI over Maidan rally 
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                            A crater on the Maidan after the DYFI rally on December 20                                  
	Calcutta, Feb. 9: Calcutta High Court has issued a contempt notice to the DYFI, the youth wing of the ruling CPM, for violating directives to preserve the Maidan while holding a rally there in December.        
	The court has also ordered a close scrutiny of possible transgressions during the Left Front rally on the Maidan on Sunday.         
	A division bench of Justice B. Bhattacharya and Justice R.N. Banerjee slapped the contempt notice on Pritam Ghosh, the president of the CPMs youth wing.         
	The court is prima facie convinced that the organisers of the rally that took place on the Maidan had violated its order passed on September 28, 2007, the division bench said, referring to the December 20 rally.         
	So, the president is directed to file an affidavit by four weeks explaining why contempt proceedings should not be drawn against him for not obeying the courts directive, the bench said.         
	On September 28, 2007, the high court had passed an order banning chullahs within 3km of Victoria Memorial, besides disallowing parking of vehicles on the Maidan. The high court had on May 7 last year passed another order saying violators of the court directive would not be given permission to hold any more rallies on the Maidan.         
	Environment activist Subhas Dutta, who had brought the DYFI violation to the courts notice, today accused the Left Front of flouting the same directives. The division bench gave him the liberty to file a fresh petition on yesterdays rally.         
	Before the DYFI rally, Ghosh had given an undertaking that the court order would be followed. Left Front chairman Biman Bose had given a similar undertaking last Friday.         
	Today, Ghosh said: We have heard about the courts stand and that we will be issued a showcause. If that happens, we will offer our submission to the judiciary. Prior to that, we cannot speak on the issue.        
	Referring to Boses undertaking, a senior advocate of Calcutta High Court said: If the court finds merit in the allegation of violation during the Left Front rally, a similar contempt notice can be served on the chairman. The court may also pass an order asking police not to allow the Left Front to hold rallies on the Maidan. In the past few years, Bose has faced three contempt cases.        
	The division bench told Dutta to collect affidavits on the violations from newspaper photographers and TV camerapersons who covered yesterdays rally.         
	The court has asked the army, the custodian of the Maidan, to be a party to the case and instructed the force to file affidavits stating how the condition of the greens changed after the two rallies.        
	Tushi Das, the lawyer appearing for the state, said the police were prompt in carrying out the courts order but Dutta opposed the submission.        
	Dutta emphasised the need for a court order asking the army and the police to jointly look after law and order on the Maidan on rally days. (See Metro)

	Jamshedpur, Aug. 6: Gopal Kumar Tiwary, who has tested positive for swine flu, was reported missing from Jamshedpur since last night, spreading fear and panic among residents and triggering a chain of contradictory claims by the administration which eventually said he was being kept in a safe house.        
	Throughout the day, district health officials maintained that Tiwary had fled to Calcutta last night, apparently in a hurry to leave for Singapore to join a new job.         
	But by late evening when Tiwary couldnt be traced, the state health department came out with a statement from Ranchi claiming the 21-year-old had been quarantined in an undisclosed location.        
	In a feeble attempt at damage control, health secretary Shivendu, who joined office in the state capital only yesterday, claimed Tiwarys location was only known to the deputy commissioner.         
	The step was taken to keep him away from the media glare. The symptoms of pandemic flu in the student are in a declining stage and his blood sample will be sent for tests tomorrow again, he said.         
	But he was hardly convincing.         
	One, because Tiwary was yet to be located. Two, health officials in Jamshedpur, including district civil surgeon Deepali Dey, claimed they had no idea about the safe house where Tiwary had been kept.        
	Gopal Tiwarys mother, Pushpa, is a doctor. She is in contact with her son who has been located somewhere in Calcutta. She has managed to convince her son that it is impossible to leave the country with the disease. He is expected to come back here by evening or late night, the civil surgeon said.        
	Later at night, well after the health secretarys statement from Ranchi, Dey and deputy commissioner of East Singhbhum claimed Tiwary had indeed been traced and was being brought back to Jamshedpur in an ambulance, betraying an unprecedented lack of co-ordination between two arms of the state health department.        
	At Kadma, East Singhbhum nodal officer Swarn Singh assured worried residents of Professional Flats, where Tiwary lives, that there was no way he would be allowed to go Singapore.         
	We have already sent out details of the patient, along with passport number, to the National Informatics Center (NIC) in New Delhi. He cannot leave for any other country as the NIC has alerted all airports across the country, he said.        
	Immigration officials in Calcutta confirmed they received a lookout notice for Gopal Kumar Tiwary. We received a notice but he did not turn up at the airport, an official said.

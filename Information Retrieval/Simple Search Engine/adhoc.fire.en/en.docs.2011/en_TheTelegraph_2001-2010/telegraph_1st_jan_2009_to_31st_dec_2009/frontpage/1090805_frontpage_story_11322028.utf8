  - Vigilance probe on nepotism and corruption charges          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT      
	Ranchi, Aug. 4: Governor K. Sankaranarayanan (in picture) today ordered a vigilance probe into charges of nepotism and corruption against former member of Jharkhand Public Service Commission (JPSC) Radha Govind Nagesh who retired in December 2007.        
	Raj Bhavan spokesman S.N. Jha said that Nagesh was no longer a member of the JPSC and a probe under Article 317 (1) of the Constitution could not be ordered against him.        
	The vigilance bureau has been asked to initiate a probe and legal action will be taken under the Prevention of Corruption Act if the charges are substantiated, he pointed out.         
	Nagesh, a former district judge, was accused of misusing his JPSC posting to favour acquaintances while appointing lecturers and civil servants.        
	According to the Constitution, a member of a state public service commission can be removed or penalised only after a Supreme Court judge conducts an inquiry on a reference made by the governor under Article 317 (1). The governor is also empowered to suspend a member until the President issues orders based on a report of the Supreme Court.        
	Sankaranarayanans predecessor Syed Sibtey Razi had referred the charges levelled against JPSC chairman Dilip Prasad and member Gopal Prasad Singh to the President. They were charged with favouring relatives and friends during appointments of civil servants and lecturers.        
	Significantly, Singh retired yesterday.        
	The governor has already ordered a vigilance inquiry into the limited competitive examinations held for recruiting 60 deputy collectors from among government employees.                                                        
	Raj Bhavan intervened after University Grants Commission, acting on a complaint of irregularities in the appointment of 1,044 lectures and 239 civil service officials last year, had asked the governor to look into the matter. The complaint had been lodged by the Jharkhand BET-NET Association.        
	In other decisions today, the governor also suspended and ordered departmental proceedings against Barwadih (Latehar) block development officer Amit Prakash for alleged financial bungling and dereliction of duty.        
	He has also ordered the blacklisting of M/s Triveni Enterprises that is executing a canal at Chandil dam. Former executive engineer Tej Narayan Singh has also been a served a showcause for paying the contractor in excess

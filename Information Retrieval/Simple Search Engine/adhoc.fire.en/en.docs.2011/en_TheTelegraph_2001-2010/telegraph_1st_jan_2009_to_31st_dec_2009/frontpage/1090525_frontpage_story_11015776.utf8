                                                                                                           First Black boss for Nasa
          SCOTT WILSON                            Bolden: Leader, visionary                                  
	Washington, May 24: President Barack Obama yesterday nominated a former marine aviator and space shuttle astronaut to become the new head of Nasa and oversee a broad review of the agencys ambitions for manned and robotic space exploration.         
	Retired Major General Charles F. Bolden Jr will become the first African American to run the space agency if approved by the Senate.         
	In addition to his long resume of military and Nasa experience, Bolden served more recently as chief executive of a defence and aerospace consulting firm. He briefly worked as an aerospace lobbyist.         
	Bolden would take over Nasa as it is winding down the decades-old shuttle programme and working towards Obamas stated goal of returning a man to the moon by 2020.         
	Hes a patriot, a leader and a visionary, Senator Bill Nelson said of Bolden in a video statement. He understands the workings of Nasa and the importance of America remaining a leader in science and technology through space exploration.         
	Nelson flew on space shuttle Columbia with Bolden in 1986. It was the first of Boldens four shuttle missions.         
	Hes going to face budgetary constraints, technical issues, remaining shuttle launches and the impending end of the space shuttle, said Nelson, who heads the commerce subcommittee that oversees Nasa operations. He has to restore that wonder that space exploration provides, and he needs to carry out the Presidents mission.         
	Bolden, 62, grew up in segregated South Carolina and won a commission to the US Naval Academy. As a marine aviator, he flew more than 100 sorties over North and South Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. Decades later, he served in the Persian Gulf before retiring from the Marine Corps in 2004.         
	He commanded two shuttle missions, the last in 1994, and has more than 680 hours in space. He has served in a variety of other positions at the space agency, including as an assistant deputy administrator.         
	Obama also nominated Lori Garver, a former Nasa associate administrator, as the agencys deputy administrator.         
	In a statement, Obama said: These talented individuals will help put Nasa on course to boldly push the boundaries of science, aeronautics and exploration in the 21st century and ensure the long-term vibrancy of Americas space programme.

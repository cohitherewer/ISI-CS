The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | State misses patta deadline
                                                                                                           State misses patta deadline
          SANTOSH K. KIRO                              
	Ranchi, Aug. 14: The governors pledge to award land rights to 8,826 forest dwellers on Independence Day will be honoured only partially tomorrow, courtesy the tardy progress made by deputy commissioners (DCs) in verifying pattas (land deeds).        
	About 800 tribal and non-tribal forest dwellers  barely 10 per cent of the set target  will be issued land documents, a freedom they had long been fighting for.         
	West Singhbhum will have the largest number of proud landowners. Deputy commissioner Sunil Kumar will distribute 157 land deeds among claimants. Seraikela-Kharsawan and Hazaribagh will follow close with 143 and 134 landowners, respectively. In stark contrast, the districts of Ranchi, Koderma, Khunti, Jamtara and Garhwa will have none. Reason: officials there are still processing documents.        
	In mid-July, state chief secretary A.K. Basu had issued strict orders to deputy commissioners of all districts to speed up the process of verifying applications under the Scheduled Tribe and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act and prepare land documents in their names.         
	After Governor K. Sankaranarayanan assumed office, he ordered DCs to complete the task of issuing pattas to 8,826 applicants, who had filed petitions within July 30, by August 15. The land documents, according to the order, were to be distributed among all the beneficiaries during I-Day functions at various district headquarters.         
	But that seems unlikely to happen.        
	In Ranchi, no land document will be distributed tomorrow because not a single application has reached the level of deputy commissioner for consideration. The documents are under process at sub-divisional offices, said a district official, not willing to be named. Busy with I-Day preparations, Deputy commissioner K.K. Soan was not available for comments.        
	Jamtara DC Kripanand Jha pleaded helplessness. Since none of the applications came to me through proper channel, I had to send them back to gram sabhas for verification. But we will expedite the process and meet the October-end deadline given by the state for applications filed after July 30, he said.                                      
	In Koderma, DC Kanaiya Pandey had his excuse, too. Most claimants in my district are non-tribal forest dwellers. Under the law, they have to prove that they were in possession of land for three generations. This task is difficult and it takes time to identify a genuine beneficiary, he said. Pandey added that some 100 applications had come up for consideration at the gram panchayat level, but the petitioners had not been able to prove their claims.        
	Good news came only from Sunil Kumar. We have made elaborate arrangements to distribute pattas among 157 beneficiaries at the I-Day function, he said.        
	Figures from seven other districts  Chatra, Palamau, Latehar, Godda, Deoghar, Dhanbad and East Singhbhum  were not available because their DCs are accompanying the central team that is here to assess crop loss and decide on a relief package in the wake of a statewide drought.

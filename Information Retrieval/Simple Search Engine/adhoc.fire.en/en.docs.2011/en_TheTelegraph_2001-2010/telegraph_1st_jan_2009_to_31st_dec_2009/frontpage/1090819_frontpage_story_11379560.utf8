	Kabul, Aug. 18: At least 10 people died in episodes of violence around Afghanistan, just two days before presidential elections with the area near the presidential palace coming under fire.        
	We understand that two mortars or rockets  as we call it, indirect fire  hit somewhere in the vicinity of the presidential palace and the ministry of defence, said Captain Elizabeth Mathias, a spokeswoman for the US military. There were no immediate reports of casualties.        
	The deputy presidential spokesman, Hamid Elmi, who spoke to The Associated Press, said that the palace was not seriously damaged and that President Hamid Karzai had not been injured.        
	Elsewhere in Kabul, several civilians and one Nato service member were killed in a suicide car bombing in Kabul. In the attack, a statement from the Nato-led International Security Assistance Force said a military convoy had been attacked on the road leading east to Jalalabad. A statement from Afghanistans interior ministry said seven civilians were killed and 50 wounded.        
	The UN confirmed that two of its Afghan staff members were among those killed, though it was unclear whether they were included in the interior ministrys count. Two US troops with the international security force were killed today in a separate roadside blast in Paktika province.        
	Nato forces said today they would suspend offensive operations on election day, deploying coalition and Afghan troops to protect voters, election monitors and polling stations. The Afghan government had earlier called for a truce during Thursdays voting.

          OUR BUREAU                            Chaudhry, Sharif                                
	March 16: President Asif Ali Zardari has agreed to reinstate Iftikhar Chaudhry as chief justice, a stunning capitulation that defused a rebellion, weakened the presidency and marked the coming of age of popular protest in a country inured to dictatorship.        
	Its the first time in the history of Pakistan that a movement launched by the middle class has proved successful, said retired judge Tariq Mehmud, a leader of the lawyers whose movement achieved critical mass when Opposition leader Nawaz Sharif joined them.        
	The concession, broadcast at dawn on television by Prime Minister Yousaf Gilani, came as Sharif and caravans of supporters were inching towards Islamabad on the Long March after he broke free from house arrest in Lahore.        
	Army chief General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani was widely reported to have met Zardari and Gilani on Sunday night and urged a solution to the crisis, adding to US efforts.        
	Soon after Gilanis broadcast, Sharif called off the march, ending a momentous weekend in Pakistani politics that some are still viewing with trepidation as a lull before another storm. Chaudhrys reinstatement will cool tension but friction is likely to persist between an enfeebled Zardari and an emboldened Sharif.        
	Sharif has extended an olive branch to Zardaris Pakistan Peoples Party through Gilani who has emerged stronger. If Gilani, whose relationship with Zardari is said to be under strain, chooses to close ranks with Sharif, matters could again slide towards a flash point. Sharif told Gilani their parties should evolve a joint strategy towards political reconciliation.        
	Into this simmering cauldron has been added an unknown but iconic quantity called Chaudhry. The reinstatement (of Chaudhry)... will further complicate politics, said Brian Cloughley, a defence analyst. Nobody knows what his allegiance is, in terms of Pakistans Constitution.        
	But others saw the move as helping stability. All the players are a bit chastened. I dont foresee any precipitate adventurism, said former minister and analyst Shafqat Mahmood.        
	For the moment, Pakistanis are sampling with delight what Sharif called the fruit of our struggle.        
	Jubilant lawyers gathered outside the Islamabad residence of Chaudhry, who will be sworn back in as chief justice on Saturday, a day after the incumbent retires. The grinning jurist briefly made an appearance on the balcony.        
	The turning point in the standoff came last afternoon when Sharif confronted armed riot police and barbed wire roadblocks outside his villa in Lahore. Our orders are to stop him, a senior police officer, who identified himself as Ijaz, said.        
	At that stage, Sharifs convoy included only half a dozen vehicles and a few hundred supporters. But as soon as he emerged from the villa, the police stepped aside and allowed them through the barricades and the crowd began to swell. Nobody can stop him now, Ijaz said with a smile.        
	The collapse of the security effort in Lahore, apparently on the orders of the provincial police, represented the erosion of Zardaris authority.         
	People danced, sang and waved banners atop cars and trucks as smiling policemen watched from the sidelines, riot gear discarded to the ground.        
	It was one of the most remarkable scenes in the citys recent history, said Arif Nizami, the editor-in-chief of The Nation newspaper.                     WITH AGENCIES AND NYTNS

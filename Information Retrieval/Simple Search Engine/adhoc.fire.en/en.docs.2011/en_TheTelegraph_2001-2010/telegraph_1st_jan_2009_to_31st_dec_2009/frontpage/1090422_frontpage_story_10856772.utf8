          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Laxmananda Saraswati                                  
	Bhubaneswar, April 21: Orissa police today claimed to have picked up a Maoist commander who allegedly masterminded the killing of the VHP seer that triggered last years anti-Christian riots in Kandhamal.        
	Udaya, alias P. Rama Rao, the commander of the rebels in Kandhamal, Rayagada and Gajapati districts, was arrested along with three associates, after a raid on their hideout in Rayagadas Gudari forest early this morning, district police chief Ashish Kumar Singh said.         
	Udaya was one of the masterminds behind the murder of Swami Laxmananda Saraswati, and four of his associates at their ashram in Kandhamal on August 23 last year, Singh said. Thirty-eight people, mostly Christians, had died in the riots that followed the murders.        
	Udaya is the third in the rank in the Vansadhra division and a link between (the Maoists) Andhra committee and the Orissa unit, Singh said. The rebels refer to Kandhamal, Rayagada and Gajapati as the Vansadhra division.        
	Two of the associates picked up, Surendra and Jadu, are hardcore cadre, Singh said, adding Padmana is an area committee member who provided logistics support to Udaya and others.         
	Earlier, the crime branch had arrested three persons in connection with murder of Saraswati.        
	Udaya, who has been with the rebels for 18 years, originally belonged to the Maoists Srikakulam division in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, Singh said.         
	Since being sent to Orissa in 2001 to expand the rebel network, Udaya was involved in over 20 cases of murder, rioting and looting of government armouries in Udaygiri and Nayagarh, Singh said.         
	Some of the cache seized from Udaya and others bore marks of the Nayagarh district armoury, Singh said.        
	On February 15 last year, Udaya, with around 500 armed rebels, charged into Nayagarh police stations, police training centres as well as the district armoury.        
	Udaya had also led the Maoists who stormed the Udaygiri police station, jail and the armoury in Gajapati district in March 2006. They had looted arms and abducted the officer-in-charge of the police station and the jailor, Singh said.

          SUJAN DUTTA                                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 24: Defence scientists and military commanders today downed shutters, with each of the authorities denying responsibility after the failure of an Agni II missile that was being tested last night.        
	This is the second failure of the 2000km-range nuclear-capable missile this year after claims by the defence establishment that it was inducted by the armed forces five years back.        
	The missile was said to have been proven by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) before the army took possession for deployment in 2004.        
	It was developed by the DRDOs Advanced Systems Laboratory, Hyderabad, and integrated by the defence public sector unit Bharat Dynamics Ltd in association with private companies. DRDO sources said they could not comment because the Agni II now belonged to the Strategic Forces Command (SFC), which was conducting the trial.         
	Military sources said, however, that DRDO scientists were monitoring the test and that they would be able to explain what had happened after an investigation that could take up to two weeks.        
	The SFC is a unified command of the three armed forces that reports to the Nuclear Command Authority headed by the Prime Minister. The SFC is the custodian of nuclear weapons and their delivery systems.        
	The test yesterday was the first being carried out by the SFC at night.         
	DRDO sources said they could not comment because the Agni II now belonged to the SFC.Military sources said DRDO scientists were monitoring the test and they will be able to explain what happened after an investigation that could take up to two weeks.        
	A scientist said the missile was launched successfully but went off its pre-set trajectory about a minute after lift-off when it was at a height of about 20km. The missile has a two-stage thrust, the first lasting about 60 seconds and the second about 50 seconds.        
	The possibility is that the second-stage booster did not fire in the way it was expected to. Strangely, the last failure, in May, was also said to be at the second stage. On that occasion, when the missile was fired at 10.06 in the morning, it did not travel the full distance.        
	Visual evidence from last night, said the scientist, suggests the missile fell into the Bay of Bengal off Wheelers Island, near Orissas Balasore.        
	The Agni series of missiles is part of the DRDOs Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) first headed by A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. The Agni III with a range of 3,500km failed a test in 2007.

                                                                                                           Poster threat to police station
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Aug. 1: Deployment of armed police force was intensified at the Kanpur police station, about 70km from here, after Maoists dropped posters vowing to blow it up.         
	One poster was found pasted on the signboard of a shop at Rushipada in Kanpur area of Narsinghpur block in the districts Athagarh sub-division yesterday. It had left the people of the area fearing for their lives.        
	Confirming that the posters had been found, Cuttack (rural) superintendent of police Rajanikanta Mishra said that he had doubts over the Maoist hand in writing those. Maoists have never been seen to use green ink for conveying their message. They usually use red ink, Mishra said.        
	We are conducting a probe. We are not taking any chances. The Kanpur police station has been fortified. Two Orissa State Armed Force sections have already been deployed. Efforts are on to get leads on visits by any stranger to the area, he added.        
	The poster read: We will blow up the police station. The innocent and the poor are being harassed in this police station.         
	On June 23, 2007, several leaflets of Maoist literature were found on Orissa High Court premises in Cuttack.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Air force seeks nod to shoot Maoists in self-defence
                                                                                                           Air force seeks nod to shoot Maoists in self-defence
          SUJAN DUTTA                             An Mi-17 chopper                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 1: The Indian Air Force has asked the government for permission to open fire during the offensive against Maoists when its helicopters will transport equipment and troops.        
	We have asked permission to open fire in self-defence after one of our air warriors was killed by Maoists who opened fire from the ground, Air Chief Marshal Pradeep Vasant Naik said here today.        
	The use of lethal firepower from the air is a sensitive issue. Even in Jammu and Kashmir and in the Northeast, the air force says, it has not done it. But a senior air force headquarters officer said the offensive against the Maoists required separate rules of engagement that are now being drafted.         
	Armoured and armed Mi-17 helicopters of the Indian Air Force will be used extensively during the offensive, as will be pilot-less spy planes, Naik said. He said we do not want to publicise the number of Indian Air Force personnel and equipment to be deployed in the anti-Maoist offensive, because it was up to the ministry of home affairs.         
	We are very, very chary about collateral damage (killing or hurting non-combatants), the air chief said but there is definitely a case for greater use of airpower.         
	The air force sought permission about 45 days back  in August  when the Union home ministry began calling for inputs from multiple agencies in the security establishment to plan its offensive. Defence minister A.K. Antony, asked about the IAFs plea, said: We are yet to take a decision on it. We will take a decision at some point of time. Right now we are providing logistical support.         
	The anti-Maoist offensive has begun unfolding in Chhattisgarh but it is likely to be stepped up later this month after the Maharashtra Assembly elections (October 13).         
	The flight engineer in an IAF helicopter, Sergeant Mustafa Ali, was shot in the head on November 14 last year even as Squadron Leader T.K. Choudhury was desperately piloting the Mi-8 to safety. Suspected Maoists had opened fire with AK-47 rifles damaging the helicopters rotor blades, fuselage and engines but it managed to fly from Pidia, about 500km from Raipur in Chhattisgarh, to Jagdalpur, Bastar district. The helicopter was barely 30m above the ground when it was targeted.         
	Again on April 16 this year, an Mi-17 piloted by Squadron Leader R. Dhobhal and Flying Officer K. Prakash was fired at at Binagonda in Maharashtras Gadchiroli district when it was transporting voting machines and polling personnel to Laheri. The helicopter was being loaded when the attackers opened fire.         
	On the strength of its experience, Naik said, the IAF had made recommendations and sought permission to use the Mi-17 in attack mode if it seemed fit.         
	The IAF tries to ensure that there is minimum threat to the air crew in these areas, the Air Force chief said. The role of the IAF in internal security is going to increase. We are already involved in internal security in different areas of the country, Naik said.        
	The air force has used its helicopters from as many as 13 airbases largely to transport troops and machinery, in search and rescue operations and as air ambulance. In February 2008, however, it deployed two Chetak (two-seater) helicopters to help ground troops track Maoists who had raided police armouries in Orissa.         
	Naik said in the offensive against Maoists that was now on the drawing board, unmanned aerial vehicles could be used to guide and direct ground troops. But he said arming the pilot-less planes for firing on the ground was not likely.        
	He referred to the USs using Predator drones against suspected Taliban militants and said remember, none of this is being done in own-territory, because the risk of collateral damage runs high. He said he believed the air forces primary role was in or near the borders but it was inevitable that it would get involved in internal security duties.         
	The decision to go on the offensive (from the air against in Maoist zones) is a very tricky issue and must be taken at a very very high level, the Air Chief said. It must be based on 120 (sic) per cent intelligence, he said.         
	Pending the permission to open fire in self-defence, the air force was using tactical measures in the naxal areas, Naik said. We pay attention to angle of descent, uniform of the crew and such like, he added. The angle of descent is often a downward spiral because the helicopters do not fly low in these areas. To land, they must descend sharply.         
	The Air Chief Marshal said the UAVs  Israel-made Searcher II and Heron pilot-less spy planes  could be equipped with sensors to see through the foliage even if the forest cover (in the naxal areas) did pose some problems.         
	These aircraft have an endurance of 12 to 16 hours and can be used not only for surveillance but also to guide ground troops. In other words, central police forces in the anti-Maoist offensive will have a kind of close air support.         
	The air force has also asked for helipads to be sanitised in such a way that they are outside the range of the firearms that the Maoists are armed with. It has said the police should have a cordon at a radius of at least a kilometre around the helipads. All air warriors, involved in the anti-Maoist offensive, have been asked to wear body armour and carry revolvers.         
	The Mi-17 helicopters that are deployed for the offensive can carry upto 1,500kg of armaments. A senior air force officer said the helicopters will be armed with machine guns but not with rockets.         
	Though the Mi-17s are used mostly to transport personnel and cargo, they can be configured to attack. In the 1999 Kargil war, the helicopters were used to fire rockets in the heights of Tololing ridge. One Mi-17 of the 152 helicopter squadron with its crew of three was brought down by a shoulder-fired rocket by the intruders.

	Syangboche (Nepal), Dec. 4 (AP): Nepals top politicians strapped on oxygen tanks today and held a cabinet meeting amid Mount Everests frigid, thin air to highlight the danger global warming poses to glaciers, ahead of next weeks international climate change talks.        
	The government billed the stunt as the worlds highest cabinet meeting. The ministers, wearing yellow oxygen masks and purple sashes reading Save the Himalayas, sat at folding tables set up on a plateau with the snow-capped peak of Everest behind them.        
	They posed for pictures, signed a commitment to tighten environmental regulations and expand the nations protected areas  and then quickly flew away.        
	The Everest declaration was a message to the world to minimise the negative impact of climate change on Mount Everest and other Himalayan mountains, Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal later said.        
	Scientists say the Himalayan glaciers are melting at an alarming rate, creating lakes with walls that could burst and flood villages below. Melting ice and snow also make the routes for mountaineers less stable and more difficult to follow.         
	Getting the ministers to the mountain safely required extensive planning. The Prime Minister, his two deputy Prime Ministers and the 20 cabinet ministers were examined by doctors before boarding helicopters to Kalapathar, a flat area at an altitude of 5,250 metres next to the Everest base camp, the jumping point for climbers seeking to scale the peak.        
	The Himalayan Rescue Associations Bikram Neupane said the politicians  bundled in thick jackets, windproof gear and woollen hats  all had adequate oxygen levels in their blood and they were in no immediate danger.        
	The cabinet spent only 20 minutes next to the mountain on a clear, sunny day in an effort to prevent any of the ministers, unused to the heights of the Himalayas, from getting altitude sickness. Several ministers were overweight, some were in their 70s and many came from the low-lying plains in the south. Four ministers declined to attend because of health concerns.

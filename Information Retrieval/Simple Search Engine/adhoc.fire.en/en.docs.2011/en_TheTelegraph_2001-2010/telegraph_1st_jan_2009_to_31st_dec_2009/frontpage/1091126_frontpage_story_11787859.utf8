          PINAKI MAJUMDAR                             Arjun Munda at a guesthouse in Jamshedpur on Wednesday. (Bhola Prasad)                                  
	Jamshedpur, Nov. 25: Former chief minister Arjun Munda believes the BJPs mission is to bring Jharkhand back on track, after it was derailed by a wayward regime propped up by the Congress.         
	Jis Jharkhand ko BJP ne banaya, uska haal ab ek bigrail beta jaisa ho gaya hai. Jharkhand patri se utar gaya hai. Iss rajya ko patri mein laney ki jaroorat hai. (It was BJP which made Jharkhand. But, now it is like a spoilt son. The state has derailed. Its time to put it back on track), he said, looking relaxed and confident even as reports came in about a low turnout in the first phase of voting.        
	Dressed in white trousers and full-sleeved shirt, unlike his usual kurta-pyjama, Munda was out of his Ghorabandha residence by 9.15am and without wasting a moment, he headed for the party office at Sakchi in a gleaming white SUV.         
	Securitymen, who are always around him, were conspicuous by their absence.        
	Three years of UPA rule had derailed Jharkhand, he said. But now, he added, the BJP-JD(U) alliance was sure to form the next government.         
	UPA rule has disappointed people, who now want a change. The trends in the first phase of polling suggest a mandate in our favour, he said while fielding calls on his cellphone.        
	Among the 26 seats where polling took place today, the BJP-JD(U) combine has sitting MLAs in 16. Also, the NDA came into the Assembly election with a distinct advantage, having won eight of the 14 Lok Sabha seats in the state.        
	Mundas confidence seemed to be based on that. The party (BJP) has helped in the creation and development of the state. The UPA government has cheated the people and has thrown the state into financial doldrums. Our government will ensure the people of the state regain their self respect.        
	But he admitted the gravest challenge was the Maoist presence in Jharkhand. Yes, its a challenge which needs to be dealt with properly. The need of the hour is to bring the rebels back to the mainstream.        
	On who would be their chief minister, Munda side-stepped the issue. It will be a consensus candidate.        
	The former chief minister chose to spend the voting day in Jamshedpur. After a round of the Voter Helpline Cell, the partys new initiative for voters, he drove to Mango to a guesthouse.        
	Hamari jeet nischit hai, aap sab daten rahen (We are sure of winning, there is nothing to worry), he told partymen waiting there, before moving to the dining table for lunch. Main aaj aaram se khana chahta hoon (I want to have lunch in peace today).         
	But did we hear voters say bon apetit?

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | On the wagon that carries Bengals sick, he regained desire to live and then died

	Jajpur (Orissa), Feb. 14: The Coromandel Express was to be Lakshminarayan Mannas lifeline out of Bengal, which had denied the 66-year-old retired school clerk affordable treatment for his heart block.        
	His eyes were shining when the train rolled out of Howrah station yesterday; he kept saying his six years of suffering would be over soon, said friend Shyamal Majumdar, who was accompanying Manna and his wife Pratima to Vijayawada, from where they were to catch the Prasanthi Express to Hyderabad.        
	Hyderabads Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Medical Science had offered to do free of charge the surgery for which Calcuttas premier government hospital, SSKM, had demanded Rs 1 lakh.        
	Manna, whose disease had given him a breathing problem, lay gasping in Majumdars arms in a dark train compartment last evening, injured and suffocated under a pile of unconscious passengers, till his ailing heart gave out.        
	Onekdin pore kaal oke hashte dekhechhilam; abar baanchte cheyechhilo (I saw him laugh yesterday after a very long time; he had regained his desire to live), Pratima sobbed softly, staring at the floor of the temple at Jajpur where she sat this morning, barely 500 metres from the overturned compartments.        
	If her personal tragedy is a shame for railway minister Lalu Prasad, its no less so for the people-friendly government of her home state that has presided for three decades over a steadily worsening healthcare system.        
	With government hospitals swamped in indifference, corruption and inefficiency and private clinics beyond most peoples means, sick wagons have for years been ferrying Bengals ailing and helpless to the far south for cheap and good treatment.        
	For thousands in Bengal like Manna, a resident of Nodakhali in South 24-Parganas, the Chennai-bound Coromandel Express has come to symbolise hope and healing.        
	Manna, who had retired as head clerk of Banali High School six years ago, had spent all his savings on his two daughters marriage.        
	In 2003, doctors at SSKM detected a blockage in his heart, said Majumdar, a man in his mid-50s and a teacher at the same school. When the hospital asked for Rs 1 lakh for an emergency surgery, he broke down and gave up all hope.        
	For six years, the emergency patient remained untreated. Then his friends raised Rs 12,000 and insisted he go to the charitable hospital in Hyderabad.I told him I would accompany him. He was not just a former colleague; he was a friend, Majumdar said.        
	The dream ended at 7.40pm yesterday, about 380km from Howrah, near Orissas Jajpur Keonjhar Road station.        
	We had just had a cup of tea each. Manna, with a smile on his lips, sat on the lower berth and gazed outside. Suddenly we felt a jerk. Sensing trouble, I put my arms around him, Majumdar said.         
	He tightened his embrace as he heard the screeching of the wheels.         
	 I realised the wheels were not on the tracks; they were ploughing though the stones beside the rails. The compartment swayed and bumped, throwing passengers off their seats. Suddenly, there was a loud noise. The coach overturned and the lights went out.        
	Groping in the darkness, the schoolteacher realised Manna was buried under several bodies.        
	I held him tight and tried to free him. I yelled for someone to show me the emergency exit. He was gasping. His voice croaked; he kept asking me to take him out of the compartment quickly. Then he fell silent.        
	Ten minutes later Majumdar stood up, his friend in his arms, and stepped off the train.        
	Local people helped me put him on a cycle van which sped off towards the nearest hospital, a 10-minute walk away. I ran behind the van. The doctor came, placed the stethoscope on his chest, checked his pulse and declared him dead.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Sanjay sting claim makes SP-Cong ties difficult
                                                                                                           Sanjay sting claim makes SP-Cong ties difficult
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Sanjay in New Delhi. (Rajesh Kumar)                                  
	New Delhi, April 1: Actor Sanjay Dutt has claimed to have carried out a sting operation on an unnamed Union minister, clouding the prospects of a post-poll rapprochement between the Congress and the Samajwadi Party.        
	Although Sanjay, with Amar Singh by his side, did not name the minister, a statement by law minister Hans Raj Bharadwaj that he had met the actor but did not discuss anything fuelled speculation that he might have been the target of the purported sting operation.         
	The Union law minister is counted as one of the staunchest Nehru-Gandhi family loyalists.        
	The Congress feels that Sanjays claim makes it difficult for the party to reach an understanding with the Samajwadis. It is difficult even if Mulayam Singh Yadav and his lieutenant Amar Singh bend over backwards to reach out and shout from the rooftops that they deeply respect Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi, a source said.        
	Sanjay told NDTV: Yes, I can confirm that I was threatened by a senior aide of a cabinet minister and warned of dire consequences.        
	 Sanjay had purportedly called on the minister around the time he was being wooed by the Samajwadis with the offer of a ticket to contest the elections from Lucknow.        
	Sanjay was told clearly that should he take such a step, even his bail could be cancelled, Amar was quoted by PTI as telling the news channel. There are certain managers of Sonia Gandhi and the Prime Minister who were against Sanjay joining the Samajwadi Party.        
	The film star alleged the minister warned him that his court case  Sanjays appeal against his conviction is pending in the Supreme Court  could go against him if he did not join the Congress.        
	Sanjays father, Sunil Dutt, also a movie star, spent his political career in the Congress and represented Mumbai (Northwest) several times in the Lok Sabha. He was sports minister in the UPA before he passed away in 2005. His daughter Priya was elected from his constituency on a Congress ticket in the by-election that followed his death.        
	For all intents and purposes, the Congress regarded Priya as Sunil Dutts political heir but was sympathetic to Sanjay when he had to serve a jail sentence after his conviction under the Arms Act.        
	Bharadwaj told the news channel he met Sanjay as Sunil Dutts son but had not discussed anything with him. Congress spokesperson Jayanthi Natarajan said: We completely deny the charges. They are vague and self-serving.        
	However, sources said Sanjays claim confirmed the Congresss worst fears about the Samajwadi Party and its unique propensity to do undercover jobs.        
	When the Samajwadis bailed out the UPA government during the trust vote that followed the Lefts withdrawal of support, Congress ministers said they were wary of meeting its leaders or even speaking over phone.         
	On the face of it, Sonia and the Prime Minister went out of their way to be courteous to Samajwadi leaders. Until the proposed alliance snapped, they were given time when it was sought.        
	Rahul Gandhi counts Akhilesh Yadav, the son of Mulayam and a Lok Sabha MP, as a good friend with whom he exchanges text messages.        
	But Sanjays charges against Bharadwaj were too hard to take, said sources.

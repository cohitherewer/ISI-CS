The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Far from glare, lethal blockade 
                                                                                                           Far from glare, lethal blockade 
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Oct. 27: Ganajit Das fell prey to the almost-daily ritual of train blockades in Bengal today, his death causing hardly a ripple in the establishment that was working itself into a frenzy over the Rajdhani Express hostage crisis.        
	The 34-year-old blood cancer patient was not on the Rajdhani but on another train travelling from Assam to Chennai. The Dibrugarh-Chennai Express was held up in Birbhums Sainthia, 200km from Calcutta, for nearly five hours this morning.        
	The difference between the two blockades: one was by Maoist sympathisers or by Maoists themselves. The other was by passengers who were demanding more trains to Howrah and stoppages.        
	Das, who hailed from Barpeta and was on his way to Chennai for treatment, fell sick in the S17 coach after the five-hour wait. He was taken to a hospital in Birbhum but could not be saved.        
	The Chennai train was stopped at Sainthia around 7am because of the blockade at Suri, 20km away, by over 200 people who came together under the banner of the Andal-Sainthia Passengers Association. The train could move only after 11.30am.        
	My elder brother was complaining about discomfort. When we reached Suri around 12 noon, he was extremely critical. My brother was declared dead on arrival at the hospital, said a sobbing Gandhara Das.         
	The question whether the patient would have survived the trip to Chennai can never be settled. But the blockade ensured that even in his final hours, Ganajit had to struggle with the worst man-made torment for travellers in India.        
	The demonstrators should have realised that many patients travel in almost all Chennai-bound trains, said an elderly passenger, Suresh Das.        
	Abir Mukherjee, the secretary of the passengers forum, said: Nobody told us that somebody had fallen sick. We could have lifted the blockade then.

  - Bengal and some other states open to new IPL dates         OUR BUREAU                      Shah Rukh cheers KKR players during IPL 2008                                
	March 17: The second season of the Indian Premier League could still co-exist with the elections with at least five host states, Bengal among them, seemingly agreeable to the new dates submitted today.         
	The revised schedule, put together by IPL organisers after the home ministry rejected the states demand for central forces, omits Delhi, Visakhapatnam and Jaipur as venues, sources said.         
	Matches have instead been proposed at Dharamsala, Nagpur, Ahmedabad and Cuttack, an indication that the organisers are willing to compromise on the home-and-away format to salvage the high-stake tournament. Calcutta, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Mohali and Bangalore  franchisee cities  are the other centres.        
	The ministry has asked the states for their views on security.         
	Under the revised schedule, Calcutta will host seven matches between April 11 and 26, well before polling in the state begins. Bengal home secretary Ardhendu Sen said he had received a revised itinerary from the Centre, but a final decision would be taken tomorrow.        
	Sen did not say in as many words but hinted that security would not be a problem. The chief secretary will take the final decision but it shouldnt be a problem now as the first phase of polls begins on April 30 in north Bengal, four days after the last IPL match. We are aware that paramilitary forces wont be available, but Calcutta police will be able to look after this. If necessary, they can take the help of the state police, Sen said.        
	IPL officials said at least three states  Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka  had cleared the recast schedule.         
	Mumbai police commissioner Hasan Gafoor said a confirmation letter had been sent. We have conveyed we have no objection to matches being held in the city as long as they dont clash with election dates, he said.         
	Punjab principal secretary (home) N.S. Kang confirmed the state had no problem with the new dates  April 12, 19, 21 and 28  for games at Mohali.        
	Gujarat had earlier asserted it was ready to secure matches in Ahmedabad provided they were held after polling on April 30.         
	Of the venues struck off, Delhi had said it could not host matches until counting of votes was over on May 16.

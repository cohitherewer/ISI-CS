  - Court advises hospital on Koda        RUDRA BISWAS CHANDRAJIT MUKHERJEE                            Koda being wheeled into RIMS on December 9                                        
	Ranchi, Dec. 15: The special vigilance court, Ranchi, today asked Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) to strike a balance between caring for undertrials and ensuring that the process of justice was not hampered, even as Jharkhand High Court called the state police incompetent for failing to arrest Vinod Sinha and Sanjay Choudhary, both aides of former chief minister Madhu Koda.        
	The court of special vigilance judge, Binoy Kant Khan, today made the observation while responding to a prayer by RIMS seeking directions of the court on whether Koda and his once ministerial colleague, Kamlesh Singh, currently admitted to the hospitals intensive care unit, could be shifted to the hospitals cottage for advanced treatment.         
	Vigilance public prosecutor Naresh Kumar Sinha told The Telegraph that in response to the RIMS prayer, the court said it was the responsibility of the hospital and the medical team attending to the two undertrials to decide where the patients should be lodged. Sinha added that the court allowed RIMS to take a final decision in the matter.         
	However, the court directed RIMS to report to the court on the medical condition of both Koda and Singh on a weekly basis and to inform how long it was necessary for both the undertrials to remain in hospital.         
	The court further observed that whilst proper healthcare of undertrials was of prime importance, RIMS needed to ensure that the process of justice that involved interrogation of the undertrials was not delayed or impeded with.         
	Vigilance sleuths got to interrogate Koda and Singh at Birsa Munda Jail on December 5 after which the two moved court praying that since they were not well they be admitted at RIMS for medical examination and treatment. The vigilance court ordered their shifting from the jail to RIMS on December 8. The following day, the duo were shifted and admitted to ICU where they continue to be.         
	Following their admission to the RIMS ICU, interrogation of both Koda and Singh has remained suspended.         
	Earlier, in the high court, a division bench of Justice M.Y. Eqbal and Justice R.R. Prasad commented on the state police after it was informed by the income tax department that both Sinha and Choudhary were absconding.                                
	The bench expressed its dissatisfaction over the inaction of the police that had not been able to trace the duo. Both Sinha and Choudharys names have surfaced in the vigilance, ED and income tax investigations against Koda.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Diwali bonus blast by RIL
                                                                                                           Diwali bonus blast by RIL
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                               
	Mumbai, Oct. 7: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), Indias largest private company, stunned the markets today with an offer of bonus shares in the ratio of 1:1 to its 35 lakh shareholders.        
	RIL is coming out with a bonus issue after a gap of 12 years and this is only the third time in its 34-year history that it has rewarded its shareholders with free shares. Back in 1997, it had offered a similar one-for-one bonus.        
	Mukesh Ambani, chairman of RIL, has consistently fobbed off pressure from shareholders to issue bonus shares over the past few years. But he finally came up with a gift-wrapped package of about 164 crore free shares just 10 days before Diwali.        
	The bonus issue will rank among the biggest issue of free shares in Indias corporate history.        
	It (the bonus announcement) was completely unexpected, said Arun Kejriwal, director, KRIS, who is also an RIL shareholder.        
	The RIL announcement was made after market hours. Earlier, the stock had closed lower by 1.6 per cent at Rs 2,099 on the BSE but market mavens expect it to soar tomorrow.        
	Kejriwal said the bonus announcement would provide strong support to the sensex.        
	The offer of one free share for every share currently held was approved by the board of directors less than a fortnight before Mukesh Ambani-owned RIL squares off for the final battle with Anil Ambanis Reliance Natural Resources Ltd (RNRL) in the Supreme Court over gas supplies from the Krishna-Godavari basin.         
	The company said the shareholders of erstwhile Reliance Petroleum Ltd (RPL), which has recently been amalgamated with RIL, would also get the bonus shares.         
	Anil Ambani will not benefit from this windfall since he no longer holds shares in RIL after the group formally split.         
	There was icing on the bonus announcement: RIL shareholders will also get an interim dividend of Rs 13 on every share that they hold. The dividend payout will amount to Rs 2,219 crore inclusive of taxes of Rs 322 crore.        
	The proposal for bonus and dividend continue Reliances tradition of rewarding shareholders on a sustained basis, RIL said.        
	It added that since the demerger in 2005, RIL had created value of Rs 2,47,000 crore in terms of market capitalisation and shareholders had earned a 40 per cent compounded return.        
	We had committed to reward our shareholders Mukesh Ambani said.

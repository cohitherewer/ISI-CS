	Habra (North 24-Parganas), Dec. 21: Priyanka Go-ldar, 9, took a bomb shrapnel in the shoulder in Habra yesterday when gunmen attacked a drawing contest-cum-blood donation camp, killing a Trinamul worker and a Congress activist.        
	But the states peddlers of political violence werent the only people to have made her suffer since yesterday afternoon.        
	The healthcare system too did  having made her wait seven hours for admission yesterday, a Habra hospital today said it had neither the equipment to pinpoint the splinter in her right shoulder, nor the surgeon to operate on her.        
	The political parties too did  todays Trinamul-backed Congress bandh meant she could not be taken to Calcuttas RG Kar Medical College Hospital for what could be urgent surgery to save a nerve or blood vessel.        
	No politician had the time to arrange transport for her despite requests  they were occupied with transporting the bodies of the slain activists from a Barasat hospital after post-mortem.        
	Priyanka, though, had had the heart to think about others even in the traumatic moment when the shrapnel stung her. Hit on the right shoulder and running in panic, she had stopped to pick up a three-year-old, a fellow drawing contestant, with her left arm.        
	Priyanka said her shoulder had suddenly gone numb as she was bent over a sheet of paper, crayons in hand, around 12.45pm.        
	I was planning to draw a landscape when I heard sounds like firecrackers going off. Something hit my right shoulder and I saw Negro kaku (Trinamul activist Ranjit Roy) fall. I started running towards home, Priyanka said from her bed at Habra State General Hospital, her wound covered with a gauze and sticking plasters.        
	Even amid the confusion she noticed her tiny neighbour, Shrabani Das, crying and scampering around. I picked her up with my left hand and ran home, Priyanka said.        
	I am grateful to her for saving my daughter despite her injury, Shrabanis mother Rina, a homemaker, said.        
	When Priyanka reached the thatched hut she calls home, neither her father, a garage hand, nor her mother, who makes jewellery boxes, was in. Priyanka kept mum but brother Akshay, 13, noticed she was bleeding and called neighbours. She was taken to the hospital around 2pm.        
	Her wound was dressed and antibiotics given at the emergency ward but she had to lie on the trolley till 9pm, overtaken by other events. First, Ranjits body was brought to the hospital; next, Congress and Trinamul supporters invaded the compound and smashed car windscreens.        
	As she was being wheeled into the X-ray room around noon today, Priyanka began crying in pain. My right arm is extremely painful and is becoming numb off and on, she sobbed.        
	We need a clearer picture of the foreign body (shrapnel) lodged in her shoulder, which only a digital X-ray can provide. She needs immediate surgery. We dont have any surgeon today and have asked her parents to take her to RG Kar, a doctor said.        
	But shaken by yesterdays vandalism, the driver of the hospital ambulance refused to take it out during the bandh.        
	We tried to contact the local Trinamul councillor and other party leaders for an ambulance, but all of them were busy bringing the bodies back, said Priyankas mother Iti.        
	The girl needs immediate surgery. Well try to shift her to RG Kar tonight, or definitely by tomorrow, said the district chief medical officer of health, Prabhas Chowdhury.        
	Calcutta-based surgeon D.J. Bhaumik said if the shrapnel did not pose a threat to a major artery or nerve, the operation could wait for a few days. The police spoke to Priyanka at the hospital. No one has yet been arrested.

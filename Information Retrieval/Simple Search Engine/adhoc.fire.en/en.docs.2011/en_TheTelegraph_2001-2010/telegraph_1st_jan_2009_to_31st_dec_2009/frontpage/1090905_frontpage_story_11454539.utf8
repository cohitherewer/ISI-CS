The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | CPM axe on land deal with Vedic
                                                                                                           CPM axe on land deal with Vedic
          BISWAJIT ROY                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 4: The CPM today asked the government to scrap its joint venture for an infotech township project with the Vedic Village promoters after examining the legal constraints.        
	At the same time, the partys state secretariat felt the government should purchase land at Rajarhat for Wipro and Infosys, which had been promised plots in the proposed township.         
	Todays meeting of the partys highest decision-making body at the state level had become stormy over fixing responsibility for entering into ventures with unscrupulous land-grabbers and finding a way out of the Vedic mess.        
	IT minister Debesh Das was summoned to explain the implications of scrapping the 1,200-acre township deal between government-owned Webel and companies floated by Vedic Village managing director Raj K. Modi and his associate, Amarnath Shroff.         
	CPM state secretary Biman Bose refused to disclose the decisions. The government will spell out its position, he said.        
	A secretariat member said: The government cant be part of a project where the private partners are unscrupulous realtors. We can come out of the deal since the Vedic people violated the agreement by grabbing land at gunpoint.        
	There was a different view, too, represented by industries minister Nirupam Sen and Das. They implored the government not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. A grim-faced Sen refused to speak as he left the meeting but the chief minister apparently agreed to explore the possibility of purchasing land for the IT companies.         
	Senior secretariat member Benoy Konar said: It will be a disaster for efforts to promote IT if the township project is abandoned completely. Debesh (Das) also told us that big IT companies like Wipro and Infosys will take strong exception if we cant honour our commitment to provide land.        
	Konar added that the two companies had said they wouldnt like to be part of the land deal with the Vedic Village promoters. Nor do they want to buy directly.        
	The government will try to purchase land in the Rajarhat area. In the meantime, legal aspects would be examined before taking the formal decision, he said.         
	Housing minister Gautam Deb, who along with Bose and Md Salim, the former MP, argued for the project to be scrapped immediately to spare the party and government further embarrassment, said: The matter has been left to the chief minister.

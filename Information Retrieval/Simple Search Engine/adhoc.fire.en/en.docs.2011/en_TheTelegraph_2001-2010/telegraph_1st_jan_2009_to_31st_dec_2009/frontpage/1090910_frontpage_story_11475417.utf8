          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 9: Laughter may be an adjunct medicine for patients with diabetes, Japanese researchers have said after a series of studies observing glucose patterns in patients who watched comedy videos after meals.        
	In a review of several previous studies, biologists at the Foundation for Advancement of International Science in Tsukuba, Japan, have said laughing after a meal appears to reduce the post-meal rise in glucose levels.        
	Laughter also appears to decrease levels of a substance in blood involved in diabetic complications such as kidney disease, the researchers Takashi Hayashi and Kazuo Murakami said in the review published on Tuesday in the journal Life Sciences.        
	In one experiment they conducted more than six years ago, Hayashi and his colleagues asked patients with diabetes to listen to a 40-minute lecture after lunch on day one and asked them to watch a 40-minute comedy dialogue show after lunch on day two.         
	Two hours after the meals, blood glucose levels were an average of 123 milligrams/decilitre after the lecture and 77 mg/dl after the show.        
	More recent studies indicate that laughter may influence the activity of genes that help control blood glucose levels. Hayashi has identified a set of genes that show a spike in activity after exposure to a laughter-inducing experience.        
	A majority of these genes are associated with an arm of the immune system that helps in regulating blood glucose. Some of these genes remain highly active up to four hours after the laughter, Hayashi and his colleague wrote in their review.         
	A research team on the other side of the Pacific has also accumulated evidence to suggest that laughter should be considered a preventive adjunct therapy in the management of diabetes.         
	Lee Berk at the Loma Linda University in California and his colleagues have found that laughter, when added to standard diabetes care, lowers the levels of substances related to stress, increases good cholesterol and lowers the risk of cardiovascular disease.

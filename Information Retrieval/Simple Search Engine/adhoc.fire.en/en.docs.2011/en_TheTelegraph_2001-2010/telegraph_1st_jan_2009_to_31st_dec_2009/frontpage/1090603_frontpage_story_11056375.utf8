  - Soft-spoken Meira can still assert her authority          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN AND G.S. MUDUR                        Meira Kumar				                                       
	New Delhi, June 2: Soft-spoken, mild-mannered Meira Kumar faces a challenge in controlling Indias unruly MPs but she can fortify herself by modulating her voice, expressions and body language.        
	Cognitive scientists The Telegraph spoke to suggested tips that Meira, who speaks in a reed-thin voice, might follow to assert her authority in the Lok Sabha when she takes over as its first woman Speaker tomorrow.        
	For instance, a lower pitch is associated with stronger personalities, said Marc Swerts, a researcher at the Tilburg University, the Netherlands.        
	A face displaying relatively few expressions  a poker face, for example  could be interpreted as confidence, but rapid movements of the eyebrows or of the corners of the mouth could be viewed as a sign of frustration or lack of confidence, Swerts, an authority on non-verbal communication, said over the phone.        
	Anindita Chaudhuri, an experimental psychologist at Calcutta University, stressed the right emphasis on words, direct messages, avoidance of fumbling and gestures indicating confidence. A person with a soft voice can still appear assertive the way the voice is used, she said.        
	Not that Meiras male forebears had had a tight grip on the House, except perhaps in the 50s and 60s when huge Congress majorities and a politer political culture had made their job easier.        
	At first sight, the 64-year-old Meira may appear at a disadvantage compared to predecessor Somnath Chatterjee. Yet neither Chatterjees stentorian tones nor his long experience as a lawyer and parliamentarian helped him rein in raucous MPs, and he was repeatedly reduced to issuing frustrated threats of resignation.        
	Congress sources said Meira would have an easier job than Chatterjee who presided over a particularly rancorous House.         
	The BJP and the Left are not likely to be aggressive for the first year or so. By the time they become combative, she will have hopefully grown into the job, a party official said.        
	Meira has on occasions showed she can be tough. In father Jagjivan Rams centenary year, 2008, she had made it clear to a foreign TV channel that interviewed her that she would not countenance a comparison between him and B.R. Ambedkar. Sources close to her said she thought both Dalit leaders were equally iconic.        
	In 2007, when the UPA government decided to convert a Lutyens Zone bungalow into a memorial for another Dalit stalwart, Kanshi Ram, Meira demanded that her fathers residence, 6 Krishna Menon Marg, be given the same status. The government set up a national foundation in Jagjivans name.        
	Meira, however, failed to show the same firmness or clarity on Dalit issues as minister of social justice and empowerment in the previous UPA government. Sources close to her said she was convinced that Dalits deserved reservation in the private sector but backed out in face of opposition within the groups of ministers looking into the issue.        
	As she today became the consensus candidate for the UPA and the BJP a day ahead of the Speakers election, a sense of unease was palpable among some officials in Parliament. She will have Chatterjee and Purno A. Sangma to look up to and someone else for company, an official said somewhat unkindly.        
	Someone, apparently, is the late G.M.C. Balayogi, Speaker from the Telugu Desam during the NDAs tenure. Whenever things got heated, his stock response was a pleading Please, please. But Balayogi was a relative greenhorn --- he was elected to the chair in his second term as MP.        
	P.K. Biju, CPM member of Parliament from Kerala, said five-time MP Meiras long parliamentary stint should see her through. I hope she will put her experience to use, he said. That the Speaker is a woman should not make a difference.        
	Meira, though, may indeed look with hope to Sangma who showed that a smile can sometimes work better than a scowl. Sangma often disarmed MPs with his constant good cheer. Sangmas rapport with some BJP members too helped him, as a lack of it hobbled Chatterjee.        
	One of Meiras jobs will be to make clear rulings on touchy issues. The former diplomat is articulate in interviews but her answers do not always come across as fully thought out.        
	Her contemporaries at Delhi University, where she got a masters in English, and the Lal Bahadur Shastri Institute for civil services probationers do not remember her as an outstanding thinker. To us, she was simply Jagjivan Rams daughter, one said.        
	That, however, was long before Meira debuted in Parliament in 1985 from Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh. She defeated, of all people, Ram Vilas Paswan and Mayavati. Now the Congress has again pitted her against Mayavati, hoping to win over Dalits.        
	BJP member Shahnawaz Hussain did not want to pre-judge Meira. What matters is that the Congress has pulled off a little coup by selecting a woman. It has sent a positive signal throughout the country, he said.        
	With inputs from Charu Sudan Kasturi and Jayanth Jacob

	Baghdad, Feb. 24: Well over half the exhibition halls in Iraqs National Museum are closed, darkened and in disrepair. And yet the museum, whose looting in 2003 became a symbol of the chaos that followed the American invasion, officially reopened yesterday.         
	Thousands of works from its collection of antiquities and art  some of civilisations earliest objects  remain lost.         
	The smell of fresh paint infuses the Room of Treasures, which even now is deemed safe enough for only photographs of the intricate gold and gem-studded jewellery made in Nimrud nearly 3,000 years ago, not the real thing.        
	Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki pushed to reopen the museum, against the advice of his own culture ministry, as a sign of Iraqi progress. Symbol it was, and symbol it remains  not only of how much Iraq has improved, but of how far it has to go. It was a rugged wave and strong black wind that passed over Iraq, and one of the results was the destruction that hit this cultural icon, Maliki declared in a dedication ceremony.         
	Yet the museum is only one institution in a place where little functions as it should  not electricity or even sewerage  nearly six years after the beginning of the war that toppled Saddam Hussein. The museum, like life here, may be more secure than at any other time since then, but it is not normal.

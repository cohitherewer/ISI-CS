The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Third front on the cards in Assam
                                                                                                           Third front on the cards in Assam
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Guwahati, March 10: Assam today appeared headed for a three-cornered contest as non-BJP and non-Congress parties, led by the Assam United Democratic Front (AUDF), stepped up efforts to give form to a third alliance for the two-phase parliamentary elections in the state on April 16 and 23.   
	Though talks have been on for some time to cobble up a front, the BJP-BJD split in Orissa and the seat-sharing arrangement between the BJP and the AGP in the state seem to have acted as a catalyst for the proposed front, which could come into existence any time now.         
	Besides the AUDF, the other parties in talks for the front are the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), the CPM and the CPI.         
	The Bodoland Peoples Progressive Front (BPPF) also inched closer to this group today, seeking unconditional support for its candidate for the Kokrajhar seat. The development comes a day after the AGP announced the candidature of Sabda Ram Rabha for Kokrajhar.         
	That work on the third front was on track was indicated by Akshay Kumar Rajkhowa, the state NCP general secretary and candidate for the Guwahati seat.         
	A morcha is very much on the cards, but we dont know what the number of constituents will be. The only bottleneck concerns a few seats, which will be sorted out anytime now. The AUDF will be the senior partner. The good news is that the BPPF, too, has given its consent to join us today and will participate in seat-sharing talks. The development in Orissa is a welcome one for us. A name for the morcha will be decided by tomorrow, Rajkhowa said.         
	Rabiram Narzary of the BPPF said a seven-member team met NCP leaders in Guwahati this morning and will place their demand before a joint meeting of the AUDF-NCP-CPI-CPM seeking their support.         
	We are sure to get their support as they had earlier resolved that they would support a Bodo candidate unconditionally. We are hopeful of a joint fight, he said.         
	Reports emanating from the four parties suggest that the only hitch are the differences between the AUDF and the CPM over the Tezpur, Barpeta and Silchar seats.         
	The AUDF has authorised its working president, H.R.A. Choudhury, to sort out the differences.         
	Talks so far between the parties have helped them reach unanimity over 11 seats, with Nagaon, Kaliabor, Dhubri and Karimganj going to the AUDF, Guwahati and Diphu to the NCP, Jorhat and Lakhimpur to the CPI and Mangaldoi and Tezpur to the CPM. Kokrajhar is all set to go to the BPPF.         
	The problem surrounds the three seats of Tezpur, Barpeta and Silchar between the AUDF and the CPM. We have offered Tezpur and Mangaldoi to the CPM but they want the others. We will see what we can do. Whatever the outcome of seat-sharing talks, we have decided to take on the BJP and the Congress, Choudhury said.                           
	The Congress will field 13 candidates, leaving Kokrajhar for coalition partner Bodoland Peoples Front (BPF). The AGP-BJP combine, too, will contest in all the 14 seats, with AGP from six and the BJP from eight.

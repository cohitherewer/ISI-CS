                                                                                                           Suspension of 2 MLAs stayed
  - Verdict on three others on Monday        OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Shillong, March 20: The Shillong bench of Gauhati High Court today stayed the suspension of two of the five legislators who had deserted the Meghalaya Progressive Alliance (MPA) ahead of the trust vote.        
	However, an unfazed Speaker, Bindo Lanong, who is a lawyer, made it clear that he would not abide by any court verdict as his suspension order against the legislators was very much within the Constitution.        
	In the interim order, Justice T. Vaiphei today said there was no prima facie case for disqualification against Independent legislator Limison Sangma and KHNAM member Paul Lyngdoh.        
	He said till the final disposal of the two petitions, the ongoing disqualification proceeding pending against the two legislators is hereby stayed.        
	He, however, added, Liberty is granted to the respondent who is the Assembly Speaker or any lawyer on behalf of him to approach the court for any modification or alteration of the order.        
	The judge said Lyngdoh and Sangma were not bound by the anti-defection law as neither had contested the Assembly elections under the banner of the MPA.         
	The petition filed by the other three legislators, Independent Ismail Marak, HSPDP member Adviser Pariong and NCP member Sanbor Shullai, will be taken up on Monday.        
	The Speaker said he would not entertain the court order and added that he had not seen it but would not abide by it even after doing so.         
	The order of all courts against my judgment do not bind me as I had gone by the Constitution, Lanong said.         
	He added that if the court seeks any clarification, he would send his lawyer to represent him.        
	Earlier, quoting Articles 122 and 212 of the Constitution and the provisions of the Tenth Schedule, the Speaker had said the jurisdiction of courts was barred in respect to Parliament and legislature.        
	Lyngdoh told reporters that he was happy that the court had upheld his stand.        
	In other developments during the day, NCP state unit president W.R. Kharlukhi issued a showcause notice to Shullai on why he should not be suspended from the party since he had switched loyalty to the Congress. Shullai has to respond to the party within three weeks.        
	The Congress said they would wait for the courts verdict on the other three legislators, before staking claim to form the next government.        
	We can still claim majority against the MPAs 28 as we have 29 members now.But we will wait till Monday for the verdict on the three other legislators, AICC general secretary in charge of Northeast Luizinho Faleiro said.        
	The MPA delegation, led by NCP leader P.A. Sangma, met President Pratibha Patil in Delhi and urged her to recall Governor R.S. Mooshahary for abetting defection and instability in the state, Independent Manas Chaudhuri, one of the delegates, said over phone from Delhi.        
	He said the delegates also met Opposition leader L.K. Advani and CPM general secretary Prakash Karat, both of whom pledged support to the MPA cause.        
	Chaudhuri claimed that Pariong, who had deserted the MPA, was set to return to its fold in a day or two.        
	The MPA has entrusted senior advocate and former Solicitor-General of India Harish Salve to file a special leave petition in the Supreme Court on Monday, challenging Presidents rule in the state.

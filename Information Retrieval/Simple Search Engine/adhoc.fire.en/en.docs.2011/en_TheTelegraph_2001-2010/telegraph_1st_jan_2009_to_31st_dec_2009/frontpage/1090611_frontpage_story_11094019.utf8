The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Karat to take ache to Basu
                                                                                                           Karat to take ache to Basu
          JAYANTH JACOB                               
	New Delhi, June 10: When in trouble, the party thinks of the patriarch.        
	The CPM high command, grappling with the worst-ever crisis in Kerala, is expected to sound out Jyoti Basu on how to tackle the corruption-cum-factionalism scandal involving the party boss in the southern state.        
	The crisis escalated today with Kerala chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan saying that he was not surprised by the governors sanction to prosecute CPM state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan in a corruption case.         
	The chief minister left enough room for manoeuvre that could help him to claim later that he merely stated a fact as other governors had taken similar steps elsewhere. But his muted statement stood out in sharp contrast with the high-decibel onslaught on the Raj Bhavan by CPM ministers and leaders.        
	A two-day meeting in Calcutta beginning tomorrow to gauge the reasons for the Lok Sabha debacle is expected to offer the occasion for the CPM leadership to raise the Kerala issue with Basu.        
	CPM general secretary Prakash Karat and politburo members Sitaram Yechury and S. Ramachandran Pillai are likely to have an audience with the party patriarch. The meeting is expected to be dubbed a courtesy call.        
	The CPM is divided over whether to remove Vijayan from the party helm and Achuthanandan from the government at one go to strike a balance. But a section has pointed out that attempts to punish the chief minister now would be seen as siding with corruption.        
	Another option being talked about is to have Vijayan step down on his own till the case is settled. But the Vijayan faction is insisting on an assurance that Achuthanandan will also be asked to resign on some other ground such as differences with the party on governance.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Kujju firefight held up   Chemicals, machine to come after two days
                                                                                                           Kujju firefight held up   Chemicals, machine to come after two days
          SANTOSH K. KIRO amp; VISHVENDU JAIPURIAR                                          
	Ramgarh, Aug. 10: It will be another two-three days before the urgent task of dousing an underground coal mine fire  singing and searing the arterial NH-33 near Kujju, 15km from the Ramgarh district headquarters  takes off. Reason: fire-extinguishing chemicals that need to be injected into the earth to contain the blaze are not available in the state.        
	Officials of Central Coalfields Limited (CCL) had expected the chemicals to arrive from Jamshedpur by this evening, but later realised that the same were not available in the steel city. We have placed fresh orders in Calcutta and Hyderabad. The operation will not begin before two-three days, said CCL chairman-cum-managing director R.K. Saha.         
	It is learnt that the coal major has roped in experts from the Central Mining Research Institute (CMRI), Dhanbad, to lead the mission at Lohagate near Kujju.         
	With the help of a machine being hired from Mahanadi Coalfields Limited in Sambalpur, Orissa, they will inject a mixture of sodium silicate, dry ammonium phosphate and nitrogen foam through a hole drilled on the highway to douse the fire. The foam-injecting contraption will also take a couple of days to reach Ramgarh.         
	CCL authorities, however, prepared ground for the operation today. Holes were drilled on the highway and water sprayed through pipes. The chemical mixture will be injected through these channels. Saha said water was being sprayed to keep the ground cool for the next three-four days. When the fire-extinguishing machine is taken to the spot, the tyres of the vehicle may burst if the ground is too hot, he explained.         
	Fissures on the Ranchi-Patna highway began spewing a mix of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide as early as June 29, but the state administration and CCL authorities woke up to the smoke alarm on July 19.         
	First, delay in gauging the damage and, then, inept handling of the situation resulted in the cave-in of a portion of NH-33 at Lohagate yesterday.        
	A 15ft wide crater caused by the collapse is now threatening 48 families who live nearby. The CCL management today served notices, asking them to vacate the area without delay. I do not know where to go. The CCL should find a place for us, said Suresh Oraon, a resident of Lohagate. A CCL official said that the area belonged to the company and the families had been served notices because they were illegal occupants.        
	The area within a 10km radius of Lohagate, meanwhile, remained blanketed by a thick cloud of smoke. Experts said the emission was very hazardous. It is a gaseous mix of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide. It will affect humans and animals alike, besides damaging the ecology of the region, said Nitish Priyadarshi, an environmentalist.         
	Hazaribagh MP Yashwant Sinha held a public meeting at Lakdigate, about 3km from Lohagate, and said that he would demand a probe into the cave-in. Sinha said he would also meet Union minister of state for coal Sriprakash Jaiswal.

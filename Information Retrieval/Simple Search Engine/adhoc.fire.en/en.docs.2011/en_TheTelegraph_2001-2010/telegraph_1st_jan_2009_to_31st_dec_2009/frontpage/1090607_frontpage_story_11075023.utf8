	Recife (Brazil), June 6 (Reuters): Search crews found two male bodies this morning from the Air France flight that crashed into the Atlantic earlier this week, a Brazilian air force spokesman said.        
	The bodies were found along with debris that came from the doomed flight, spokesman Jorge Amaral told reporters in the northeastern city of Recife.        
	This morning at 8:14am, we confirmed the rescue from the water of pieces and bodies that belonged to the Air France flight, Amaral said.        
	Among the debris retrieved today was a seat with a serial number that matched the missing flight, a rucksack and a case with an Air France ticket inside, rescue officials said. Brazils air force has been scouring a swathe of the Atlantic about 1,100km northeast of Brazils coast since Mondays crash, which killed all 228 people on board.        
	Several Brazilian navy ships have also arrived in the area, but fears have grown that many bodies sank or were devoured by sharks.        
	It was the the worlds deadliest air disaster since 2001 and the worst in Air Frances 75-year history.

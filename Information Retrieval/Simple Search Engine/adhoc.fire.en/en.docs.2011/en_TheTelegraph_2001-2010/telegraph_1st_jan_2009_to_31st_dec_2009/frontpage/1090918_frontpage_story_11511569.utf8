  - CM offers plots to Infy,   Wipro but silent on price        OUR BUREAU                            Buddhadeb on Thursday. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 17: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today tried to find a business solution to a political problem by offering 45 acres each to Infosys and Wipro in Rajarhat.         
	The alacrity of the offer  10 days after the controversial IT township project was shelved may silence the CPMs allies and the Opposition for a while, but the solution worked out in haste is expected to do little to fix the chinks in Bengals long-term business prospects.         
	Bhattacharjee skirted questions on land price  the main hurdle.        
	The land is with Hidco and we will to have to change the land use pattern only. There is already a standard price for IT and housing projects in New Town. We wont decide the price unilaterally but negotiate with both the companies, Bhattacharjee said.         
	Hidco  the same agency which will find the land now in Action Area III in Rajarhats New Town  had demanded Rs 2.16 crore an acre in 2005, which the companies had refused to pay.        
	Although Hidco chairman and housing minister Gautam Deb lowered the price to Rs 1.5 crore an acre  at which TCS scooped up 30 acres in Rajarhat  Infosys and Wipro were willing to pay only Rs 50-60 lakh an acre.        
	In the intervening years, the land price has risen further. A private telecom company paid Rs 8 crore an acre last year for three acres. Earlier, a realtor coughed up Rs 4.60 crore an acre.        
	Sources said Deb would find it difficult to scale down the price without an uproar, which has raised the possibility of the government subsidising the cash-rich IT companies and compensating Hidco.         
	A source in the IT department, said that even if Deb agreed to bring down the price he would not quote below Rs 1.5 crore an acre  much lower than the going rate. Any discounted deal at this juncture will not send the right signal to small and medium companies, said a city real estate developer.         
	Infosys and Wipro were supposed to take 90 acres each in the aborted IT township project. But the halving of the area lends credence to suggestions that the IT companies did not need vast stretches of land.        
	The haste with which the latest announcement was made also perplexed some as the IT giants do not have immediate plans to set up campuses in the state. An Infosys spokesperson said as much: When the business environment looks up and if we receive an offer from the state government, we will relook our decision.        
	Wipro, which already has a facility in the state, said: We look forward to hearing from them officially on this matter.        
	A government official termed the land announcement a knee-jerk reaction to wriggle out of the controversy over the IT township.        
	The chief minister appeared to justify the hurry by citing despondency among job aspirants in the state after the IT township was shelved. He said the two companies would create 16,000 jobs in two to three years.        
	We will be able to transfer the land right now. We already have an upcoming township there with the required social infrastructure. The presence of these companies will increase the importance of the township, Bhattacharjee said.         
	His reasoning, however, raises questions against the backdrop of the governments stated IT policy, drafted in 2003. Two targets were set in the policy document  Bengal would be among the top three IT destinations in the country by 2010 and account for over 15 to 20 per cent of IT exports.         
	Six years have passed since the target was set, but the state is nowhere near attaining it. Last year, the states contribution to the countrys IT exports was only 4 per cent.         
	The government has to realise that this target cannot be met by laying out red carpets only for Infosys and Wipro. Infosys has had a campus in Bhubaneswar for around 15 years but that hasnt made Orissa the countrys hottest IT destination, said the CEO of a city-based IT company.        
	We need smaller companies as they are critical in generating volumes. To attract such companies, we need a conducive business environment, said the official.

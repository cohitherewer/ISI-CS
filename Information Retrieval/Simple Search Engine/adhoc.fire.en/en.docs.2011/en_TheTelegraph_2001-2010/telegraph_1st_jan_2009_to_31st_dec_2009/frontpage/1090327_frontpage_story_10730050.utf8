	Ranchi, March 26: The Congress and the JMM tried to salvage their strained alliance by announcing that both would opt for friendly fights in Hazaribagh and Koderma.         
	Desperate after a near-collapse of their pre-poll understanding, state Congress president Pradeep Balmuchu and senior JMM leader and former deputy chief minister Sudhir Mahto shared a platform today to make the announcement but clarified that the seven-five deal for other seats would remain intact.        
	A JMM candidate in Hazaribagh means added problems for the CPIs lone sitting MP Bhuvneshwar Mehta. The JMMs nominee, Shivlal Mahto, son-in-law of JMMs Giridih MP Teklal Mahto, will eat into Mehtas tribal-OBC vote bank. No wonder Mehta, also the state CPI secretary, retaliated by putting up candidates in the Dumka Lok Sabha and Jamtara Assembly seats from where the ailing Shibu Soren would be contesting. Krishna Besra will be the CPI nominee in Jamtara, while former RJD MLA Akluram Mahto will contest in Giridih.        
	The CPI also declared it would contest the other sitting JMM seats, Giridih and Jamshedpur. We will, however, not contest Rajmahal, another JMM sitting seat, Mehta told The Telegraph.        
	Under the seat-adjustment deal struck on March 18, the Congress was to fight Koderma and the JMM Hazaribagh. However, at the instance of Soren, the Congress swapped seats and fielded party MLA Saurabh Narayan Singh to take on BJP heavyweight Yashwant Sinha in Hazaribagh. But Soren went back on his word under pressure from Teklal Mahto and claimed Hazaribagh, too.         
	In Koderma, while the JMM is fielding Vishnu Bhaiya, Sarafraj Ahmad and Tilakdhari Singh are the front runners for the Congress.        
	The JMM today released a list of it 49 Lok Sabha candidates  seven were contesting in Jharkhand, three in Orissa, six in Bihar, eight in Maharashtra, five in Chhattisgarh, seven in Assam, 11 in Bengal and two in Madhya Pradesh.        
	While the NDA allies, the BJP and the JD(U) are still fighting over Palamau and Chatra, the Samajwadi Party declared nominees for six seats  Daud Marandi (Rajmahal), Arjun Pujhar (Dumka), Nandlal Yadav (Godda), Digambar Mehta (Hazaribagh), Hafidin Ansari (Dhanbad) and Ashok Tripathy (Jamshedpur).        
	The SP will support the RJD-LJP in the other seats.

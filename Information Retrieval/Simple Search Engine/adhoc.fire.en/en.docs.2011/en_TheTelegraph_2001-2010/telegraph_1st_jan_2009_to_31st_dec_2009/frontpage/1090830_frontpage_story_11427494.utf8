The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Farmers at Maya door for Anil land
                                                                                                           Farmers at Maya door for Anil land
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Anil Ambani                                  
	Lucknow, Aug. 29: Two hundred farmers walked 400km from Dadri and agitated in Lucknow today to demand return of their land taken over for Anil Ambanis stalled power project, and found sympathy from chief minister Mayavati and the Opposition Congress.        
	The proposed Dadri plant has remained a non-starter because of a gas-supply dispute between the Ambani brothers five years after the government of Mulayam Singh Yadav  Mayavatis arch-rival  acquired 2,500 acres for the project. The Congress-led Centre has rejected Anil Ambanis demand for gas at $2.34 from brother Mukesh on the basis of a 2005 agreement.        
	The farmers, who began their march on August 26 and reached Lucknow last night, said they were happy with the response from Mayavati, who sent principal secretary Shailesh Krishnan to the agitation site 200 metres from the secretariat.        
	We dont want additional compensation but our land back. We want the state government to withdraw the criminal cases against us, farmer leader Rajiv Tyagi said.        
	The Mulayam government had jailed hundreds of Dadri villagers (who are now out on bail) in criminal cases after they had demanded higher compensation and tried to take back their land in July 2006, leading to police firing that injured at least 20.        
	Sources said the Mayavati government had today agreed to withdraw the criminal cases but were tight-lipped on the subject of returning land, which involves legal hassles.        
	They said Mayavati, who alleges the farmers were paid less compensation in 2004 than stipulated by the states then power policy, plans to seek legal opinion whether more compensation can be paid. After that, the state government may initiate a process to ask Anil Ambanis Reliance Energy Generation Limited (REGL) to pay higher compensation.        
	Under the project agreement of June 2004, REGL must complete the project in seven years, failing which it must pay further compensation to the land-losers. If the project misses the 2011 deadline, however, the Mayavati government might argue in court that the land be returned to the farmers, the sources said.        
	The lands character has changed, though, with a boundary wall built, the field demarcations removed, and a lot of earth dug up.        
	Congress legislative party chief Pramod Tiwari, too, met the farmers to express support. Five years have passed but there is no sign of any power plant, he said. The legal battle on gas price involving the Centre and the Ambani brothers looks set to be protracted.

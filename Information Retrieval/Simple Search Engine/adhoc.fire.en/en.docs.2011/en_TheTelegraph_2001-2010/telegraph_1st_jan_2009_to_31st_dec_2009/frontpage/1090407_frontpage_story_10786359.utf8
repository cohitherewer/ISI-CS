  Guwahati blast makes people leap to death
  - Ulfa strikes before raising day but Assam unable to save lives on eve of PMs visit					 					      A STAFF REPORTER                                                          
	Guwahati, April 6: Three blasts have killed eight persons and injured 60 in Assam a day before the Prime Ministers visit as militants renewed with impunity the ritual of bombings timed with VIP visits.        
	Tomorrow is also Ulfas raising day, an annual date for attacks along with Republic Day and Independence Day. But the Tarun Gogoi government, for all its claims about the rebels dwindling strength, failed to prevent the bombings, the goriest of which came in a bustling Guwahati suburb and near a school.        
	Seven persons, including an eight-year-old, died in Maligaon, about 13km from capital Dispur where Manmohan Singh will address his first poll rally after his heart surgery in January.         
	At least two died after jumping off the three-storey Chayaram Building  packed with people paying bills at the electricity board and BSNL counters  as the bicycle bomb exploded in front of it around 1.45pm.        
	As the bomb burst in the parking lot in front of the buildings lone exit, it caught fire, trapping people inside, witness Mrinal Kanti Singha said. We broke open the window grills and ventilators to evacuate over 100 people but two persons jumped to their death.         
	The Maligaon Lower Primary School next door had just closed for the day and several children were injured.        
	The children were coming out when the blast occurred, said Gautam Bharali, who saw weeping parents frantically search for their children amid the smoke and debris. It isnt clear if the slain child, Mousumi Begum, was a student of the school.        
	Maligaon has a cosmopolitan population with Bengalis being the largest community.        
	In the other explosions, a bicycle bomb critically injured three in Dhekiajuli, 150km north of Guwahati, and a grenade killed a police driver in Mancachar on the southwestern Bangladesh border.        
	PMO sources said Singh, a Rajya Sabha member from Assam, would go ahead with tomorrows trip that includes a rally in Dibrugarh, 440km east of Guwahati.        
	Ulfa seems to have added VIP visits to its attack calendar, a police officer said referring to the bombings during the Union home and foreign ministers trips this year (see chart). The elections have given them an added reason.        
	Highlighting the security failure, he said Ulfa would probably have triggered the blasts anyway to greet Singh even if tomorrow were not its raising day. Just two days ago, the police had released photographs of two Ulfa men suspected to have entered the city.        
	The police said a row of parked motorcycles took the brunt in Maligaon, acting as a firewall, protecting people on the pavement. More than a dozen bikes were burnt after their petrol tanks exploded.        
	Forensic officials found similarities with the March 31 blast that greeted Pranab Mukherjee: TNT was used as explosive and cycle ball bearings as shrapnel.        
	Maligaon residents erupted, attacking security forces, firemen and the media and injuring about 10 people, including journalists. The police used mild force to quell the mob.        
	Manmohan Singh condemned the blasts saying the government was committed to thwarting terrorists. Gogoi promised to deal firmly with the bombers. But the blasts have proved that Ulfa can still strike freely despite losing some of its crack cadres when the 28 battalion laid down arms last year.        
	Singh was to arrive yesterday for a rally in Diphu, central Assam, but it was cancelled after a Karbi militant group called a 36-hour bandh from this morning.

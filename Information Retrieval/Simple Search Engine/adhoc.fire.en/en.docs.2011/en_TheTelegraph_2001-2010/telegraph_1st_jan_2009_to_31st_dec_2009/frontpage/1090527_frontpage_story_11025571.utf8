  - Cong MP trained in boxing to stay fit           JAYDEEP BASU                            Rahul: Ready for knock out?                                        
	New Delhi, May 26: Be warned, Mr Advani, whatever you call Rahul Gandhi, dont call him weak.        
	The 38-year-old Gandhi scion is a trained boxer.         
	For two months last summer, Rahul trained three days a week under Om Prakash Bhardwaj, one of Indias top boxing coaches.        
	Given his dedication and eagerness to learn the finer points of the game, he could have easily been a top professional boxer, said Bhardwaj, 70. Its a pity (he isnt).        
	But it wasnt the boxing ring Rahul was readying for. He had his sights set on another bout, and Advani and Mayavati would vouch that Rahul can give his opponents a black eye.         
	The Congress MPs objective was to keep himself physically and psychologically fit, his guru said. That training would have been useful in the gruelling election campaign that has just seen Rahul emerge a winner.        
	Rahulji also wanted to learn the techniques of self defence. He is a very keen student and quick learner, said Bhardwaj, who won a Dronacharya Award  for excellence in sports coaching  in 1985, the year it was instituted.        
	In a career spanning 40 years, the coach has produced 18 Arjuna awardees, four Dronacharya winners, nine Asian championship medallists and countless national champions.         
	But he counts Rahul as his most famous and obedient student.        
	When the offer came last year to train the man the Congress sees as the countrys future Prime Minister, Bhardwaj was in two minds.        
	I have handled professionals all through my career. I was not sure how I would be able to cope with the job of training an amateur. In the end though, I thoroughly enjoyed the assignment, he said.        
	The lessons were held at 10 Janpath and mom Sonia and sister Priyanka would sometimes be around. Main bhi boxing karungi, Bhardwaj quoted Priyanka as saying once, reports PTI.        
	Rahuljis behaviour is impeccable. Never in my life have I come across such a courteous family.... Invariably a car would come to pick me up and then to drop me back home after the training session, he said.         
	Had Rahul not got busy with politics, he would have continued to train under me, said the coach one of whose wards was Hawa Singh, in his time one of Asias top boxers.        
	His body weight was 75kg and I was his lone sparring partner, he said.        
	Congress sources close to Rahul said the first they got a hint the MP, whose Lok Sabha biography lists scuba diving, swimming, cycling, squash and target shooting among his interests, might also be good at the aam aadmi sport was in April 2008.        
	The venue was Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh, where Rahul was leading a dharna, when an athletic looking youth approached him. The MP asked if he exercised and got a yes for an answer. Then he asked if he would be game for punches, and when the youth agreed, landed one on each arm. Those were a boxers punches, the source said.        
	Bhardwaj doesnt remember if Rahul was training with him at the time, but says he already knew a few techniques before they started working together.        
	The coach hasnt met his student since the election win, but says he would certainly like to resume my training if Rahulji decides to don the gloves again.

          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                              
	Mumbai, Feb. 11: The air force helicopter that narrowly missed colliding with an Air India plane at Santa Cruz airport on Monday was carrying the husband of President Pratibha Patil, top sources in the directorate-general of civil aviation (DGCA) said today.         
	The Presidents husband (Devisingh Shekhawat) was in the chopper involved in the near miss. The President was travelling in another helicopter, said the source, who did not wish to speak on record.         
	Shekhawat is a Congress party member.        
	Maharashtra government sources also confirmed that Shekhawat was on the helicopter that landed barely 30-50 metres away from the Air India Airbus A-321, which had come to an emergency halt. Yes, the Presidents husband was on the chopper that was involved in the near miss, said a top bureaucrat, who too requested anonymity.        
	However, Rashtrapati Bhavan said the first couple were flying together. Mr Shekhawat was with the President, said Archana Dutta, the officer on special duty to Patil.        
	Two days after the scare, barbs continued to fly thick and fast amid investigations to fix responsibility.        
	DGCA sources associated with the probe said they were convinced the pilots of the Mi-17 helicopters flouted well-established guidelines.        
	The air force chopper which landed on the runway ignored instructions of the fleet leader, who was communicating with air traffic controllers, said the DGCA source.        
	Air force chief Fali H. Major said the chopper pilots did not err. The inquiry is on but I can tell you that the copters in the Presidents entourage were cleared to land on a frequency on runway 27. I understand that the Air India aircraft was on a separate frequency. Why they were on two separate frequencies, the ATC will have to answer that, he said in Bangalore.        
	Major said the IAF helicopters were on the radar frequency of the Santa Cruz airports ATC. No aircraft, no helicopter or no pilot can change frequency unless asked to change frequency by the ATC, he said.        
	But ATC officials differed. The last communication between the IAF choppers and ATC was on the frequency controlled by the approach radar. The leader of the presidential fleet was told to get in touch with the tower control, on a different frequency, on reaching the Mumbai airport, said a source.        
	The air force pilots were supposed to fly keeping the runway in sight and report to the tower controller on reaching, seeking permission to land before actually touching down, he added.        
	DGCA officials who have access to the transcript of the conversation between the ATC and the chopper pilots say this was not done.         
	In fact, there was no communication. It seems the three IAF choppers did not or could not even communicate with each other, said the DGCA source.

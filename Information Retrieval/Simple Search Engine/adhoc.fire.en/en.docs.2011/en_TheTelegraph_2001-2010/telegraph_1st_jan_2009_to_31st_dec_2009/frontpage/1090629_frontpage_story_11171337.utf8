                                                                                                           Nanny reveals drug secrets of Jackson
          BEN LEACH                            Michael Jackson                                  
	London, June 28: The former nanny of Michael Jacksons three children has told how she regularly had to pump the pop stars stomach to remove dangerous cocktails of drugs.         
	Grace Rwaramba, who flew from London to Los Angeles yesterday in the hope of being reunited with Jacksons children, has described the singers increasingly desperate final months.         
	The 42-year-old revealed how Jackson had led a nomadic life, moving between countries and staying in hotels.         
	The singer is believed to have been taking up to eight different drugs a day, including three narcotic painkillers. Rwaramba said: I had to pump his stomach many times. He always mixed so much of it.         
	There was one period that it was so bad that I didnt let the children see him.... He always ate too little and mixed too much.         
	Rwaramba, who is expected to be interviewed by detectives about whether she helped administer the drugs, also claimed that Jackson sometimes hid his money in black rubbish sacks and under the carpets at the Los Angeles house he was renting.         
	The nanny said she had once called in the singers mother, Katherine, and sister, Janet, to attempt an intervention, trying to persuade the singer to come to terms with his addiction. Instead Jackson turned on her, accusing her of betraying him.         
	He didnt want to listen; that was one of the times he let me go, she said.         
	Rwaramba, who is from Rwanda, worked for Jackson for more than a decade but was dismissed for a final time last December. She said she had been back to see the children since then.         
	She said when she returned in April, Jackson was so short of money that she had to buy happy birthday balloons for one of the children with her own credit card.         
	Rwaramba, who was quoted in the Sunday Times and News of the World, started as an office assistant before becoming nanny to Jacksons children, Michael Jr, known as Prince, aged 12, Paris, 11, and Prince Michael II, 7, nicknamed Blanket.

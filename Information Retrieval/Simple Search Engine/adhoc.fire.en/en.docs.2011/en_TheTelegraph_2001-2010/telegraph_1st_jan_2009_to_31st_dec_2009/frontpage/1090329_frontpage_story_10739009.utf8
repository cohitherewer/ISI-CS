          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, March 28: Veteran Congress leader J.B. Patnaik has not found place in the partys list of candidates released today, even as several senior leaders managed to get tickets for next months elections.        
	Party sources said the 82-year old leader, who was representing Begunia constituency in the dissolved Assembly, was interested to contest again. However, the Congress high command was not in favour of fielding the three-time chief minister this time, apparently to keep him out of state politics.        
	Patnaik said he would campaign for the party. Earlier, I had not contested the polls in 1990 and 1995, However, I had campaigned for the party then too, he said.        
	A few days ago, the AICC general secretary in charge of Orissa, Ghulam Nabi Azad, had indicated that the party would opt for a new face for the post of chief minister, if the Congress came back to power.

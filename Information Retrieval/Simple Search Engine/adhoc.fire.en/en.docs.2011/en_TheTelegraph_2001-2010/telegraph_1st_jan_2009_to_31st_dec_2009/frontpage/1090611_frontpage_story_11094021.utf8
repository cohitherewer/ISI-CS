The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Cars day off? Why not, asks court
                                                                                                           Cars day off? Why not, asks court
  - Judges tell Mumbai corporation to experiment to check pollution          OUR BUREAU                                                    
	Mumbai, June 10: Why cant cars stay off the roads once a week, Bombay High Court asked today.        
	Hearing a PIL seeking measures to curb vehicular pollution and improve traffic flow, the court suggested that the municipal corporation of Greater Mumbai see if it was feasible to keep cars off the roads once a week based on the last digit of their registration numbers.        
	You have to try it out, Justice Bilal Nazki said, supporting the suggestion offered by the V.M. Lal committee appointed by the Maharashtra government to suggest ways to decongest Mumbai in 2000.         
	With cheaper cars coming out, we will have more cars on the roads. Why not experiment? the judge asked, suggesting the corporation could test the idea on an arterial road.         
	The municipal corporation, which had argued against the proposal, then asked the court for two weeks to file a reply.         
	With Nano, the worlds cheapest car, due to be out on the roads next month, the corporation might want to consider the experiment.        
	Several cities across the world, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Jakarta, Portland and Yokohama, have experimented with no-car days.         
	Beijing introduced no-car days for the Olympics last year. Some of the restrictions were brought back last October to cut smog and make traffic smoother. Depending on the last digit of the licence numbers, the cars were divided into five groups and each group was banned for one weekday, with no ban on weekends. The new restriction covered government vehicles and corporate cars. The ban was applicable for 15 hours for private cars and round-the-clock for government and corporate cars.        
	As an incentive, the restricted vehicles are exempted from paying vehicle tax for a month and road maintenance fee for a year.         
	But those who violate the restrictions would have to forgo the relief and pay a fine of 100 yuan (Rs 700).        
	In Calcutta, when Subrata Mukherjee was mayor, he had toyed with the idea of allowing cars with even numbers on the roads on some days and those with odd numbers on others. But the plan never took off because the database wasnt computerised.        
	Why should 90 per cent of the population suffer pollution because of 10 per cent? Justice Nazki asked, referring to petitioner Bombay Environmental Action Groups contention that only 10-15 per cent of the population used cars or two-wheelers.         
	Earlier, the division bench of Justices Nazki and V.K. Tahilramani asked the government what it was doing to reduce dependence on private vehicles.        
	Debi Goenka of the Bombay Environmental Action Group, who welcomed the court directive as a good step, pointed out that 12 per cent Mumbaikars who use private vehicles take up 85 per cent of road space.         
	The BEST buses... travel at an average speed of 12km per hour. If you reduce number of private cars plying on road, buses could move faster.... During taxi strikes in Mumbai, 55,000 taxis go off the road.... it dramatically reduces pollution, and allows BEST buses to ply at a better speed, Goenka added.        
	The petitioner is pushing for restricting the number of private vehicles on the citys roads.        
	Another suggestion the Lal committee had made was to impose congestion tax on vehicles coming into the city from outside, along the lines of the daily congestion charge London introduced in 2003 for cars driving into the centre of the city. But the government lawyer representing the corporation opposed the idea, saying Mumbai has five entry points and the corporation would not have enough manpower to collect such a tax.         
	The first no-car day was observed in the Netherlands and Belgium during the Suez crisis of the fifties. Sundays were car-free days from November 25, 1956, to January 20, 1957.        
	New cars        
	The Union government has ordered 15 new cars for its senior bureaucrats and ministers. Home minister P. Chidambaram got a Ford Fiesta yesterday to replace the Maruti Esteem he had been using during the UPAs last term. All the other 14 cars are Ford Ikons, of which 11 have been delivered, sources said.

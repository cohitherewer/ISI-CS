          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 17: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today flagged the possibility of fresh attacks by Pakistan-based terror outfits, sending a calibrated message to both his domestic audience and to interlocutors in Islamabad.        
	The message: New Delhi wants talks and peace, but that does not mean it has taken its eyes off the terror apparatus which continues to threaten Indias security.        
	Indeed, in calling cross-border terrorism a most pervasive threat at a chief ministers conference on internal security today, the Prime Minister may have indicated to Pakistan his displeasure with the tardy progress Islamabad has made on meeting Indias fundamental demand for resuming composite dialogue  demonstrable, credible and sustainable action to dismantle the Pakistan-based terror infrastructure.        
	There is credible information of ongoing plans of terrorist groups in Pakistan to carry out fresh attacks, Singh told the conference. There is need for continued vigilance. The area of operation of these terrorists today extends far beyond the confines of Jammu and Kashmir and covers all parts of the country.         
	Pakistan tonight said it stood ready to co-operate fully in pre-empting any act of terror if India shared information. In all sincerity, we would request India to share information that they have and for our part we stand ready to co-operate fully in pre-empting any act of terror, the Pakistan foreign office quoted an official as telling Indias acting deputy high commissioner in Islamabad.         
	The Prime Ministers warning comes on the heels of reports that Pakistan-based terrorists are mounting ambitious infiltration bids across the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir ahead of winter.        
	Levels of infiltration which had come down very substantially have seen a surge this year, the Prime Minister said. The infiltrators appear more battle-hardened, better equipped and in possession of sophisticated communications equipment.        
	Singh may even be trying to allay widespread unease over the Sharm-el-Sheikh joint statement with Pakistani counterpart Yousaf Raza Gilani. The Prime Minister has made several statements within and outside Parliament that India will not resume the composite dialogue with Pakistan unless its concerns on terror are addressed.        
	The Indian and Pakistani foreign secretaries are due to meet a month from now on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York and review progress made on the terror front before the two foreign ministers meet.

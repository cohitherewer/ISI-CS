The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Koda waits for UPA call
                                                                                                           Koda waits for UPA call
          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                               
	Ranchi, May 17: If the Congress were to look to Jharkhand for MPs to make up the UPAs numbers to reach the magic figure of 272, the choice would boil down to one new Independent MP.        
	The UPA needs 11 parliamentarians only, and from Jharkhand it already has one avowed supporter in Madhu Koda, the man whom the Congress helped prop up as chief minister and who is now only too keen to join the bandwagon for the greater good of Jharkhand.        
	That Koda emerged victorious by defeating Congress stalwart, the 85-year-old five-time MP Bagun Sumbrui, in Singhbhum is unlikely to come in the way of his induction, as throughout Jharkhands recent political turbulence, he has maintained that his loyalties were with Sonia Gandhi and the UPA.        
	Koda is ready to be a part of UPA but he knows it will be an unreasonable demand to ask for a ministerial berth, said a source close to him, adding that he was going to New Delhi tomorrow to lobby his case.         
	The other Independent is former Assembly Speaker Inder Singh Namdhari, who won from Chatra. But he is an unlikely choice as he won with the backing of the BJP. We fought to install L.K. Advani as Prime Minister. Now, Advani is no more in the reckoning. I will discuss with my supporters and decide my role at the Centre, he said.        
	The UPA has another pressing issue to resolve vis--vis Jharkhand. With JMM still an ally, will it be interested in another experiment in Jharkhand and help Shibu Soren become chief minister now that he has won the Jamtara Assembly seat?        
	The party high command will decide the role of Soren and Koda after a new government is installed at the Centre, said Congress general secretary Shailesh Sinha.                                
	But sources revealed the party wasnt keen on any half-baked measures in Jharkhand, having now been reduced to one MP from Jharkhand as against six in 2004.        
	Former minister Subodh Kant Sahay, the lone Congressman to win this time, said he wasnt averse to dissolving the Assembly  in suspended animation since January 19 when Presidents rule was imposed  and face early elections .         
	Another thought among state congress leaders is to hold elections _ due in 2010 _ under an elected government rather than under Presidents rule.         
	But, the victory of as many as five MLAs in the parliamentary elections has added another dimension to the states problem of installing a stabel government. They are Arjun Munda, P.N. Singh, Karia Munda (all BJP) along with Independents Namdhari and Koda.         
	Two other Assembly seats (Poraiyahat and Simaria) were lying vacant with the resignation of Pradeep Yadav and the demise of Ram Chandra Ram. In all, seven Assembly seats are vacant, for which byelections are to be held within six months.         
	It may not be politically prudent to go for by-elections in these seats in November and then have Assembly elections in February-March, pointed out Namdhari.

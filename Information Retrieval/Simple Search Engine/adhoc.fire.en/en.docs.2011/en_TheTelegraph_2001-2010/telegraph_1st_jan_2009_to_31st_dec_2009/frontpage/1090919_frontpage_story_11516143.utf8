The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | PM sees joke, but party warms grill
                                                                                                           PM sees joke, but party warms grill
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                           (From right) Manmohan Singh, wife Gursharan Kaur, and Sonia Gandhi at the iftar party at the Prime Ministers residence on Friday. (AFP)      
	New Delhi, Sept. 18: The Prime Minister today dismissed as a joke ministry colleague Shashi Tharoors cattle class and holy cows comment even as lesser Congress mortals reached for the cleaver.        
	Asked about the controversy over the junior external affairs ministers Twitter remark, Manmohan Singh said at an iftar party hosted by him and attended by Sonia Gandhi: It was a joke.        
	Rahul Gandhi, asked at the venue, declined comment.        
	Congress spokesman Manish Tewari, though, was not prepared to laugh it off as a Freudian slip. Appropriate action will be taken at appropriate time, he said, ominously.        
	Ashok Gehlot, the Congress leader feted for a famous victory in Rajasthan where he is now the chief minister, demanded Tharoor hoof it out of the ministry.        
	Tharoor, in another entry on the social networking site, has said sorry, trying to explain that the holy cows in his tweet (he will travel) cattle class out of solidarity with all our holy cows stand for sacrosanct issues or principles and not persons.        
	It did not appear that some of his party colleagues were buying the argument because though no one is saying it in so many words, the objection is to holy cows and not to cattle class as was being made out. I want to reiterate what my colleague Jayanthi Natarajan said that we condemn such remarks, Tewari said.        
	To repeated queries about the possibility of Tharoors expulsion from the ministry, Tewari replied: I will neither add nor subtract anything from what I have already said.        
	Does the party support Gehlots demand? Such reactions are natural. People are bound to get upset.        
	Gehlot said Tharoor, being a wise man, should quit voluntarily instead of waiting to be sacked.        
	The dapper minister of state has fallen foul of some in the party who see him as perpetually chasing publicity. His stay in a five-star hotel for three months did not make him any popular either.         
	Tharoor is not the first politician to make a comment with one thing in mind  its hard to imagine he consciously described the Congress leadership as holy cows unless he wished to commit suicide on Twitter  only to find it being interpreted in another way.         
	The BJPs M. Venkaiah Naidu and the Trinamul Congresss Derek Brien would, if they could, sympathise with him for an unfortunate choice of words. Naidu has entered the history books for calling L.K. Advani the iron man, which was seen as another way of saying that Atal Bihari Vajpayee was not.         
	Brien had said on a TV programme that Mamata Banerjee was a changed person, much improved and found himself dumped in the doghouse for daring to imply she was ever less than perfect.        
	Given the examples, Tharoor should not be surprised at all the beef. Its not clear yet, however, if he should begin to expect to be sent to the slaughterhouse.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Guwahati, Nov. 5: Families of Ulfa leaders Chitrabon Hazarika and Sasha Choudhury who last saw the duo over a decade ago are contemplating moving court to ascertain their whereabouts after the outfit last evening said they had been taken away from Dhaka by unidentified persons.         
	An e-mail purportedly sent by Raju Barua, the military spokesman for the outfit, to the media last evening said Hazarika and Choudhury were taken away by unknown persons from a house in sector 3 of Uttara in Dhaka on Sunday night.         
	Barua also appealed to Dhaka to reveal the whereabouts of the two.         
	He even hinted that Indian forces may have abducted the two leaders and appealed to Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to take up the issue as a concern of sovereignty and security of Bangladesh and resolve the issue amicably with India, if they have indeed been abducted to the other side of the border.         
	Sasha is from Helosa village in Nalbari district, while Chitrabon is from Jakhalabandha in Nagaon district.         
	Prosen Choudhury, Sashas brother, told The Telegraph today that they were not aware of anything except for what had appeared in the media.         
	He said the family would wait for the Centre to clarify the reports.         
	Prosen said the family had last seen Sasha in 1996 when he came out on bail from jail.         
	But he never came home... he just disappeared and since then we have not heard from him, he said.         
	Sasha had earlier been arrested in Mizoram.         
	If the government says it knows nothing, then we will plead before the court to ask the external affairs ministry to make inquiries, Prosen said.         
	After all, my brother is an Indian citizen and we must know the facts in view of the reports that have appeared, he said.         
	Echoing him, Chakra Hazarika, brother of Chitrabon, said the family has no information about him.         
	What we know is from the newspaper and TV reports, he told The Telegraph.         
	Chakra, a businessman based in Nagaon, said the family would move the court if required to know about Chitrabon.         
	We have consulted lawyers and if required we will move New Delhi also, he said.         
	We last saw Chitrabon about a decade back, Chakra said.         
	Even as the families awaited a word on the two Ulfa leaders, senior police officials in the state said they had not received any information about them.         
	Like everyone else, we know only what has appeared in the print and electronic media, a senior police official said.

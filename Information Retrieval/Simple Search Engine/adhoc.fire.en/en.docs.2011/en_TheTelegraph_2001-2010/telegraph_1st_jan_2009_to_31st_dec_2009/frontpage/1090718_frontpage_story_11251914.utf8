                                                                                                           Ekka, Rai declared absconders
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Ranchi, July 17: The vigilance court today declared two former ministers  Anosh Ekka and Harinarayan Rai, both untraceable for quite some time  as absconders and directed that they surrender within a maximum period of 30 days.        
	The court further ruled that a written proclamation to this effect and stating that the duo surrender before court within a maximum of 30 days be affixed outside their official residences in Ranchi and native villages in Simdega and Deoghar, respectively.        
	Arrest warrants had been issued against the two former ministers, accused of amassing assets disproportionate to their known sources of income, on June 27. However, since then the duo went underground to evade arrest. Raids in Ranchi, Deoghar and Simdega by vigilance sleuths proved futile after which the vigilance department moved court to declare the two absconders along with a prayer to attach their properties.        
	Meanwhile, both Ekka and Rai have moved the vigilance court, seeking anticipatory bail. While Ekkas prayer has already been rejected, the vigilance court has fixed August 1 as the date of hearing for Rais bail petition.

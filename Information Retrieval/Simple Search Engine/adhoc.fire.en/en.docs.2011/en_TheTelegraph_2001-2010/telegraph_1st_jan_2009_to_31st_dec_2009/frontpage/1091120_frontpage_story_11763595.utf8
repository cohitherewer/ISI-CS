	Ranchi, Nov. 19: Congress has pledged a stable, corruption-free government in Jharkhand where the poll arena seems to have been consumed by one single issue  Madhu Koda and his Rs 2,000 crore empire allegedly built from illegal investments while he was a UPA-backed chief minister.        
	Stressing on its concerns for the aam admi, the Congress managed to project stability along with a people friendly policies. The partys manifesto, released here today by the partys Jharkhand in-charge, K Keshav Rao, promised to create five lakh jobs, hold panchayat polls in 100 days, build pucca houses for BPL families, apart from giving 25 kg wheat/rice at Rs 3 per kg to the poor.         
	 The party also promised holding talks with Maoists to try and wean them away from violence by creating employment opportunities in villages.         
	The party would provide a corruption-free and stable government. Rural development would be our focus and improving the economic situation in villages would help bring back Naxalites to the mainstream, said Rao while releasing the 16-page manifesto along with state party chief Pradeep Balmuchu and Ranchi MP and Union minister Subodh Kant Sahay.        
	Rao said if the Congress and its alliance partner, Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JVM), were able to form the next government in the state, its plans and policies will be guided by the manifesto.        
	Promising to make governance corruption free, the manifesto said that all ministers and MLAs would declare their assets every year. Also, clearing of mining leases, a process tainted by kickbacks that allegedly helped Koda amass crores, would be made more transparent.        
	Just as the BJP promised to provide wheat/rice at Re 1 per kg and salt at 25 paise per kg to BPL families, the Congress also opted for a similarly populist exercise, but at a marginally higher price at Rs 3 per kg. The party also promised free school and university education for students of minority groups along with free coaching for those who opt for competitive examinations.         
	On land for industry, the Congress promised minimum or no displacement due to major projects. It would first ensure rehabilitation of land donors before beginning land acquisition.         
	Accepting the urgent need to generate more power for the state, the party promised to set up two additional thermal power plants.

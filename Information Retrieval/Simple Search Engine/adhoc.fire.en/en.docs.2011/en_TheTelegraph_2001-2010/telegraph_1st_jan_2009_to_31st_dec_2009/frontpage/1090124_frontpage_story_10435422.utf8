The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | PM set for bypass today   Procedure at AIIMS by ace surgeon 
                                                                                                           PM set for bypass today     -  Procedure at AIIMS by ace surgeon 
          G.S. MUDUR                                                
	New Delhi, Jan. 23: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will undergo a bypass surgery tomorrow that doctors say will confine him to a hospital bed on this years Republic Day but is aimed at enabling him to return to active working life.        
	Doctors recommended a bypass surgery after tests at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) here earlier in the week revealed multiple blockages in Singhs arteries that they say will be best tackled with grafts of fresh blood vessels.        
	A team of doctors from AIIMS and the Asian Heart Institute (AHI), Mumbai, will jointly perform the surgery that is expected to begin early morning tomorrow, sources said.        
	Singhs predecessor, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, had knee surgery, but had gone to Mumbai for the operation.         
	The bypass operation, which involves using healthy blood vessels from some other part of the body to create new channels of blood flow to the heart, is expected to be completed in six to eight hours.        
	The AIIMS-AHI doctors are likely to perform a beating-heart surgery which does not require a heart-lung machine. The new channel is created while the heart continues to beat. In a beating-heart surgery, we have lower loss of blood, we need less of (blood) transfusion, and the risk of tissue injury is reduced, said a senior team member.         
	A surgeon can also operate at relative leisure without having to constantly worry about how long a patient is being maintained on the (heart-lung) pump, the doctor told The Telegraph.         
	But some doctors caution that Singh is undergoing what they would classify as a risky procedure. Details of how many vessels will be grafted and whether they can achieve full revascularisation will be clear only during the operation tomorrow, a cardiothoracic surgeon said.         
	The risk increases when a patient undergoes a repeat bypass and when a patient has diabetes which increases the chances of infection and can sometimes lengthen the process of healing, he said.         
	But experienced surgeons can reduce the risk. The team from the AHI is led by Ramakanta Panda, a cardiothoracic surgeon who has conducted the highest number of high-risk bypass surgeries and repeat bypass surgeries in India.        
	Cardiologists had detected the blockages in Singhs arteries after a series of tests, including an angiography, that had been conducted after he reported non-specific symptoms such as fatigue, a senior team member said.         
	This will be Singhs second bypass surgery which makes the procedure technically more complex than a first-time bypass, sources said. But (despite the blockages) his hearts pumping action is intact, which is a good sign, a source said.         
	After the procedure, Singh is likely to be maintained on a ventilator and sedatives for several hours, perhaps up to 24 hours. This gives the heart some period of rest, said a senior surgeon who is not a member of the team.         
	Doctors say patients who undergo repeat bypass surgeries are typically kept in intensive care units for about three days, and discharged from hospital in about seven days with advice to rest at home.        
	The surgery is intended to enable him to return to normal activity, a senior doctor in the AHI-AIIMS team said. But the pace of return to normal levels of activity after such bypass procedures is usually left to patients.        
	Doctors say the time taken for full recovery and return to normal activity can range from six weeks to eight weeks.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Jaswant boot upsets Atal
                                                                                                           Jaswant boot upsets Atal
  - Party bypassed ailing veteran        SANJAY K. JHA                               Jaswant, Vajpayee				                                       
	New Delhi, Aug. 20: The unceremonious exit of Jaswant Singh has saddened his original benefactor Atal Bihari Vajpayee.        
	Jaswant, who returned from Shimla this evening, plans to call on Vajpayee soon to explain his position.        
	Sources revealed that Vajpayee, who communicates through gestures to close aides because of poor health, had conveyed his anguish at Jaswants expulsion for writing a book on Mohammad Ali Jinnah.        
	Jaswant, who said he would certainly meet Vajpayee, declined to say if he had communicated with the former Prime Minister. He said: I would rather not answer this question.        
	Asked if he would have been treated shabbily by the party had Vajpayee been active in BJP politics, Jaswant said: I cannot guess what would have happened then. This is a hypothetical question. Vajpayee is not in a position to change the course of BJP politics at this juncture but the party used to consult him on big decisions.        
	Both L.K. Advani and Rajnath Singh earlier chose to sound out Vajpayee before any major political event, including national executive meetings. But this time, they chose to ignore Vajpayee even though the ongoing chintan baithak at Shimla is being held at the time of a grave crisis in the party.        
	Vajpayee is known for his consensual approach and had yielded to Advanis pressure on the question of removing Narendra Modi after the Gujarat riots but the BJP Parliamentary Board, of which the former Prime Minister is still a member, did not consult him while taking this decision to sack Jaswant.        
	Jaswant also expressed his sense of hurt at Advanis reluctance to defend him. At a media conference in Delhi this evening, Jaswant recalled how he had stood up against the treatment meted out to Advani during the earlier Jinnah controversy in 2005. You should forget the favour you do to others but never forget the favour done to you by others, he said.        
	Jaswant also contested the charge, articulated by Arun Jaitley in Shimla today, that he had attacked the core of the BJPs ideology. Which part of the core I have attacked I dont know. Had they read the book, they would have learnt I refuted Jinnahs philosophy and I said his intractability led to Partition and what is so core about Sardar Patel? He was the first person to ban the RSS. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had banned the RSS after Mahatma Gandhis assassination and cracked down on its leaders  a detail the BJP has chosen to forget while adopting him as an icon to dilute Jawaharlal Nehrus stardom.        
	Asked why a Jaswant Singh cannot have a place in the BJP if the ideology is so stretchable as to accommodate those who demolish mosques, he said: I dont know. Perhaps I am too uncomfortable a presence for some of them.        
	Campaign attack        
	At the BJPs Shimla introspection, many delegates have identified the partys Advani-centric Lok Sabha campaign as the prime reason for the poll defeat.

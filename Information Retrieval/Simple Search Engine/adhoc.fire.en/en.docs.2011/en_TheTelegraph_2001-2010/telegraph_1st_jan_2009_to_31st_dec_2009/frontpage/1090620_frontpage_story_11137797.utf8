          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, June 19: Harish Khare, currently political editor of The Hindu, is to be Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs new media adviser.        
	A respected veteran of the field, Khare, 62, will replace Deepak Sandhu, who graduated into the job after retiring as the governments principal information officer.        
	Sources said Sandhu is likely to move to the Central Information Commission as commissioner once Khare takes over.        
	Khares appointment is being seen as an effort to bring on board not only a more hands-on and connected mediaperson but also someone who will become a fluid bridge between the PMO and the Congress. Khare is an active journalist of long standing and known to be well networked into the Congress, he will be able to conduct the Prime Ministers press office in a way that does not make it appear isolated from political exigencies, sources said.        
	A doctorate from Yale and a widely-read columnist, Khare is also expected to play speech-writer to the Prime Minister and bring his experience to bear on a wide range of policy issues.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | India launches drive for flu vaccine
                                                                                                           India launches drive for flu vaccine
          G.S. MUDUR                               
	New Delhi, June 12: The health ministry is charting a two-track course to acquire a homegrown vaccine against the pandemic H1N1 influenza through Indian companies within the next four to six months, officials said today.         
	The indigenous vaccine effort is likely to use stocks of seed virus from the World Health Organisation, Vineet Chawdhry, joint secretary in the health ministry, said, outlining Indias vaccine plans and pandemic preparedness.         
	Chawdhry said India would continue to seek out and isolate individual patients infected with the H1N1 virus and their close contacts, and treat them with anti-viral drug oseltamivir in an effort to prevent spread within local communities.        
	He said the Centre had also advised states to invoke the Epidemic Act that allows state authorities to restrict the movement of infected patients or detain them in specified health facilities.        
	Health authorities today detected a 16th case of H1N1 in India  a six-year old girl in Hyderabad who had arrived from the US earlier this week. But officials said tonight that there was no evidence of severe disease or cluster of infections in India yet.         
	Researchers believe the pandemic alert from the World Health Organisation gives countries such as India time to prepare for community-level spread. A vaccine effort would increase preparedness for the pandemic that is expected to last months.         
	The WHO has agreed to share the seed virus with us as part of a policy of sharing the virus with countries which have local (vaccine) manufacturing capacity, Chawdhry said. India could make the vaccine available to other countries too.         
	India will pursue the H1N1 flu vaccine through two technologies  conventional egg-based manufacture as well as cell-based production  said Vishwa Mohan Katoch, the director general of the Indian Council of Medical Research. Scientists expect that the cell-based production method would require prior laboratory work but can deliver more vaccines in a shorter time.         
	Two companies  Bharat Biotech, Hyderabad, and Panacea Biotek, New Delhi  have proposed cell-based production. The Serum Institute of India, Pune, may pursue egg-based manufacture, the officials said.         
	They have submitted proposals and have indicated they would like to see assured procurement of the vaccines. Were likely to finalise a programme of action in the next five to seven days, an official said.        
	Wed like to fast-track the regulatory processes for the vaccine so that it is available in the shortest possible time, Chawdhry said. We expect to have a vaccine in four to six months, he said.        
	Health officials and industry scientists cautioned it is too early to say how much vaccine would be available for use. We dont even know the size of the dose yet, so we cannot predict exactly how much vaccine can be produced each month, Sai Prasad, vice-president, business development, of Bharat Biotech, said.        
	An announcement by global pharmaceutical giant Novartis has also bolstered hopes for a vaccine. Novartis said it had produced the first batch of a candidate H1N1 vaccine weeks ahead of expectation using cell-based manufacturing technology.        
	The cell-based strategy allows vaccine production to be initiated once a pandemic virus is identified without the need to adapt the virus strain to grow in eggs as with traditional vaccine technologies, Novartis said. quot;It has cut weeks off the time required to begin vaccine production, quot; the company said in a news release.         
	The cell-based production facility in Germany has the potential to produce millions of doses of vaccine each week, the company said. In the cell-based method, the virus is grown in millions of tiny cells instead of inside eggs and harvested for purification.         
	Prasad said accelerated production process could lead to a candidate vaccine ready for testing in animals in four to six months. But any vaccine would also have to be shown as safe and effective in humans before it is approved for mass manufacture.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Students advised to leave hills
                                                                                                           Students advised to leave hills
          OUR BUREAU                              
	July 10: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha has requested students staying in hostels and tourists to leave Darjeeling hills by Monday noon after which an indefinite strike might be called if the government does not remove the senior-most police officer in north Bengal.        
	This is the first time students are being asked to leave Darjeeling schools, some of which are still counted among the most reputable institutes of the country.         
	However, the Morcha hastened to add that the advice had been issued to ensure that students were not confined in hostels without food if the threatened strike dragged on and not because they hailed from outside the hills.        
	The three hill subdivisions have around 5,000 student boarders, including many from neighbouring countries. But it is not tourist season now.        
	The latest round of unrest unfolded because of a turf battle between the Morcha and the Gorkha National Liberation Front that has largely been ousted from the hills but retains some pockets of influence in the foothills.         
	Tension, building over the past few days over a rivalry to back construction orders, burst forth this noon, triggering clashes between Morcha supporters and police in Panighata, about 40km from Siliguri.        
	The police burst tear-gas shells and baton-charged a Morcha rally after participants allegedly attacked the house of a GNLF leader.        
	The Morcha, which has been accusing the state machinery of being vindictive towards its supporters, called a strike and demanded the transfer of K.L. Tamta, the north Bengal inspector-general of police, and two other officers. Morcha president Bimal Gurung also sought the arrest of Rajen Mukhia, whose house was attacked, for allegedly getting police to beat up rivals.        
	We will give time till Monday noon to the government to fulfil our demands. Even then, I request all tourists, along with school and college students, to leave the hills, Gurung said, relaxing the strike till the deadline. Even if our demands are met, some agitation will continue. That is why I have requested those residing outside the hills to leave.        
	A senior teacher of North Point, Darjeeling, said there were 250 international students in the hostel. We do not know what we will do; we will take a decision at a governing body meeting tomorrow.

	Whittlesea (Australia), Feb. 9 (Reuters): Weary firefighters and rescuers pulled the remains of dozens of people from charred buildings today as the toll from Australias deadliest bushfires rose to 171, police said.        
	Everybodys gone. Everybodys gone. Everybody. Their houses are gone. Theyre all dead in the houses there. Everybodys dead, cried survivor Christopher Harvey as he walked through the town of Kinglake, where most people were killed. A Victoria state police spokesman told Reuters by telephone late today that the toll had risen to 171 from about 135 hours earlier. He said the toll would almost certainly rise further.        
	Police believe some of the fires, which razed rural towns near the countrys second biggest city, Melbourne, were deliberately lit and declared one devastated town a crime scene. There are no words to describe it other than mass murder, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd earlier told local television.These numbers (of dead) are numbing.        
	The bushfires are the countrys worst natural disaster in more than a century, and will put pressure on Rudd to deliver a broad new climate policy.        
	One massive bushfire tore through several towns in the southern state of Victoria on Saturday night, destroying everything in its path. Many people died in cars trying to flee and others were killed huddled in their homes, yet some escaped by jumping into swimming pools.        
	The inferno was as tall as a four-storey building at one stage and was sparking spot fires 40km ahead of itself as the strong winds blew hot embers in its path. Its going to look like Hiroshima, I tell you. Its going to look like a nuclear bomb. There are animals dead all over the road, said Harvey.        
	More than 750 houses were destroyed and some 78 people, with serious burns and injuries, are in hospital.        
	Many patients had burns to more than 30 per cent of their bodies and some injuries were worse than the Bali bombings in 2002, said one doctor at a hospital emergency department. In Canberra, lawmakers fought back tears as they suspended parliament for the day after expressing condolences to the victims on behalf of the stunned nation.        
	It is the beauty and the wonder of our country, National Party leader Warren Truss said. It can also be harsh and cruel. How can these idyllic landscapes also become killing fields?        
	Wildfires are a natural annual event in Australia, but this year a combination of scorching weather, drought and tinder-dry bush has created prime conditions.        
	The fires, and major floods in Queensland state in the north, will put pressure on Rudd, who is due to deliver a new climate policy in May. Green politicians are citing the extreme weather to back a tougher climate policy.        
	Scientists say Australia, with its harsh environment, is set to be one of the nations most affected by climate change. Continued increases in greenhouse gases will lead to further warming and drier conditions in southern Australia, so the (fire) risks are likely to slightly worsen, said Kevin Hennessy at the Commonwealth Scientific amp; Industrial Research Centre.

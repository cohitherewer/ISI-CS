	Ranchi, Sept. 25: Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh have become epicentres of Left-wing extremism and the Centre is committed to end the so-called armed liberation movement, Union Home minister P. Chidambaram said here today.        
	He chaired a meeting to review the security situation in the state and steps being taken by the administration to counter the Naxalite menace. The meeting, held at Raj Bhavan, was attended by Governor K. Sankaranarayanan, his advisers G. Krishnan and T.P. Sinha, director-general of police V.D. Ram and other top police officers.        
	The CPI(Maoist) has already been declared an outlawed organisation. We reject any form of armed rebellion against the state. The Centre will leave no stone unturned to counter and end the menace at the earliest, said the home minister who arrived in a BSF flight around 1pm.         
	Chidambaram, however, categorically denied any plan to involve the army in counter-insurgency operations during a possible major offensive against Naxalites but maintained that the Centre would provide adequate paramilitary forces to the states to curb the menace.        
	Ironically, he hailed the state administration, declaring that it had been able to contain Left-wing extremism at many places. However, he refused to declare possible dates for major strikes against Naxalites in the region, but rather chose to maintain that the fight was on and it would be turned towards a logical end.        
	Chidambaram seemed much impressed on the development front with the performance of the state, currently under Presidents rule. I learnt that 87 per cent of beneficiaries under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) are paid wages through bank and post office accounts. I have advised authorities to raise the level to 100 per cent, he said.        
	Moreover, he said that though the public distribution system was in a sorry state for two years, it had now been virtually re-invented. Those eligible are getting rice, wheat, sugar and kerosene oil either free or at controlled prices. Suvidha shops are offering goods at cheaper prices, while disbursement of old-age pension has been regularised. Administration here has done excellent work for the poor and the needy, said Chidambaram.        
	Apparently forgetting that the state has been under the UPA-supported regime since 2006, Chidamabram said that people here had suffered a lot in the past and now were enjoying better facilities under the current administration.         
	I must say that whichever government comes in future, it will oblige by extending the sops to the poor that were started of late, he claimed.         
	After a hurricane tour, the home minister left for Delhi at 5.30pm.                    
	However, he conceded that the state was facing difficulty in laying roads in Naxalite-affected rural areas. The state is to lay over 3,500km of rural roads under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana and other state and Centre-sponsored schemes.         
	Asked about the arrest of top-rung leaders like Kobad Ghandy in Delhi, Chidambaram said that people like Ghandy and frontal organisations take a romantic view of Left-wing extremism but it was a challenge for our democracy that many studies have proved.

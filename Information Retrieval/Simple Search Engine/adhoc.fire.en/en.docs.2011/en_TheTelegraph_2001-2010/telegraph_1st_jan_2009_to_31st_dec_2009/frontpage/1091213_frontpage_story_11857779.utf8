  - Animal strays out of Orang, cops seek army help to control crowd          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Mangaldoi, Dec. 12: A rhino that strayed out of Rajiv Gandhi Orang National Park charged at a curious crowd of onlookers that ventured near it in Kharupetia town this afternoon, triggering a near stampede. A child was injured and police were forced to seek the armys help to control the situation.         
	The female rhino damaged a police vehicle and a handcart in the town, 50km from Orang, in Darrang district.         
	On being informed by the divisional forest officer of Orang, Sushil K. Daila, a team of experts from the zoo in Guwahati, 100km from the town, rushed to the site to tranquillise it. The rhino will be tranquillised tomorrow, Daila told this correspondent. The animal will then be translocated to Manas National Park.        
	The circle inspector of Kharupetia, Pranab Saikia, said the situation was under control and security forces were keeping a strict vigil in the area. We are keeping five elephants ready to carry out the tranquillising operation.        
	Daila said the six-year-old female rhino strayed out of the park yesterday morning after being chased by a male rhino that was not ready for mating.         
	The rangers were guarding the rhino when it vanished under the thick cover of fog in the wee hours. The rhino was in the Dalgaon area till around 2am. Our guards kept trailing it but it vanished under the thick cover of fog, the official said.        
	The rhino was spotted by Niranjan Banik, a resident of Kharupetia, early this morning in his backyard.         
	As news spread, hundreds of people thronged Baniks residence to see the rhino which then moved towards Hospital Road, the hub of Kharupetia town, with the crowd following it, the official said.        
	The rhino then charged at the crowd and damaged a police vehicle and a handcart. Panic-stricken villagers tried to scamper to safety and in the melee, a minor girl tripped and was injured. When the situation spun out of control, the army was called in and the crowd dispersed.        
	The rhino is now taking shelter in a ditch near a bamboo groove about 200 metres from Kharupetia police station, Daila said. Nearly 20 forest guards are keeping a close watch to ensure that the animal remains safe from poachers till experts arrive from Guwahati.        
	Rhinos straying out of the national park become easy prey to poachers. So we have to keep guard, though trailing a rhino is a tough task, Daila said.

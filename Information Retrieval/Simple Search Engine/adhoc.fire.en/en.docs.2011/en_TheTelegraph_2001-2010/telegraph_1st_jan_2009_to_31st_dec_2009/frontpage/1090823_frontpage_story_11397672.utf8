	London, Aug. 22 (PTI): Two of Hollywoods hottest heartthrobs, Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise, are battling each other for the title of best World War II movie.        
	And the war has been waged by Inglouriuos Basterds actor Brad Pitt who has branded Tom Cruises film Valkyrie as ridiculous.        
	 Pitt teamed up with director Quentin Tarantino for the war drama, which was released just a few months after Cruises 2008 drama about a plot to kill Nazi leader Adolf Hitler.        
	 However, Pitt insists his portrayal of Nazi hunter Aldo Raine in Tarantinos film is no comparison to his rival Cruises character.        
	The second World War could still deliver more stories and films, but I believe that Quentin put a cover on that pot. With Basterds, everything than can be said to this genre has been said. The film destroys every symbol. The work is done, end of story... (Valkyrie) was a ridiculous movie, Pitt told the German magazine Stern.

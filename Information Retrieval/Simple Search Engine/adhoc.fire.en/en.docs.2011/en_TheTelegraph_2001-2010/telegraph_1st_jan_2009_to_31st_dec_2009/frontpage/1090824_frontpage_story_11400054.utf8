	Ranchi, Aug. 23: Six rebels, disguised as pilgrims, were arrested with 1,100 SLR cartridges after a brief encounter near Silli village on Silli-Gola road around 2.30am today.        
	The cartridges, supposed to be handed over to Maoist sub-zonal commander Kundan Pahan, were carried from Munger in Bihar in a car escorted by a motorcycle.        
	Senior police superintendent Praveen Kumar said that the breakthrough had come after someone tipped them about the ammunition supply. I have informed my Munger counterpart who is conducting raids to arrest the supplier, Kumar said.        
	Those arrested were identified as Bholo Shaw alias David, Pradeep Mahto, Rajesh Kumar Mahto, Prafulla Kumar Mahto, Mandal Das and Murari Hussian. Except Pradeep and Hussain, all were dressed as pilgrims visiting Baidyanath Dham during Shravan Mela. Pradeep, riding the motorcycle, was escorting the ammunition-laden car, driven by Hussain, in which the other four were also travelling.        
	Kumar said that Pradeep was arrested first near the village, about 40km from here. After interrogation, Pradeep divulged the information and we targeted the car, he said.        
	Kumar added that seven rounds of firing took place before the six could be arrested. Soon after the police intercepted the car, one of the extremists opened four rounds of fire. We retaliated with three rounds and the extremists, finding themselves in a spot, surrendered, he said.        
	The ammunition seized are suitable for use in self-loading rifles (SLR) and other automatic assault firearms. Kumar said Bholo alias David was a key member of the Pahan group. He has been active in Bundu and Tamar for the past four years and can be called Kundans right hand. He is wanted in at least 12 cases registered in Bundu and Tamar police stations, he added.        
	In another breakthrough, Kundan Pahans area commander Budhram Lohra was arrested and a 10kg can bomb was recovered from Barigarha village under Bundu police station around 3pm.         
	Budhram was wanted in more than six cases, including cleaning out of a cash van of a bank last year, killing of five special task force jawans in Rahe, an attack on Baruhatu police picket. On the basis of information collected from him, we recovered a can bomb planted on the road to blow up police vehicles, Kumar said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | weak isnt meek   Anointed PM candidate, Manmohan strikes back at Advani 
                                                                                                           Weak isnt meek 
  Anointed PM candidate, Manmohan strikes back at Advani           RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                                          
	New Delhi, March 24: From so be it to who is the weakest?        
	Manmohan Singh today eschewed sedate economics for political sword-fight in a performance crackling with stinging barbs at L.K. Advani and the Left and quick retorts to questions on his being a weak PM.        
	Minutes earlier, Sonia Gandhi, sitting by Singhs side at the release of the party poll manifesto, had unequivocally signalled that he was the Congresss candidate for Prime Minister.        
	Asked about party leaders demand for her son Rahul to lead the government, Sonia pointed at the pictures of herself and Singh on the manifestos cover and then cropped herself out with her hand.        
	Then Singh took over. He bristled at Advanis charge of being a weak PM and this time gave back more than he got, calling the BJP leader an opportunist and referring to him as this person.        
	If you look at Advanis record, the only prominent role he played was in the Babri demolition. What else has he done to the contribution of national welfare? When he was the home minister, Parliament was attacked.... He was the home minister who presided over the massacre in Gujarat. The country must reflect whether this person is fit to hold the PMs post, Singh said.        
	He wasnt done.        
	Advani was opportunist enough when he went to Pakistan. There he suddenly discovered new virtues in Jinnah. When he came back, his party disowned him, his masters in the RSS and many of his colleagues disowned him. He is a strong man or a weak man  let the records speak for themselves.        
	As for himself, whether I am a weak or a strong Prime Minister, actions of our government speak volumes about it, Singh said.        
	The Prime Minister then clubbed the CPM and the BJP as retrogressive parties that want the country to go backward, although he made a distinction between the two.        
	He accused the CPM-led third front of lacking a viable alternative and the CPM of a negative mindset on the nuclear deal.        
	Singhs attack comes weeks after a bypass surgery and 19 months after another rare show of belligerence, when he had told The Telegraph: I told them (the Left) to do whatever they want. If they want to withdraw support, so be it.        
	That was over a bigger issue  the nuclear deal  but todays rapier thrusts stunned many in the Congress who see him as a padha-likha (erudite) economist rather than a political warrior.        
	If the outburst contributes towards turning Election 2009 into a US presidential-style contest between two individuals, the Congress is unlikely to mind  given the economic uncertainty and Singhs reputation as the crisis manager who was in the thick of things when the country faced a crisis in the early nineties.        
	Earlier, Sonia had said: There are many claimants to his post but none of them can stand before Dr Singh.        
	Sources underlined the departure from the partys tradition of letting its MPs choose their leader after the polls, and attributed it to Sonias unquestioning trust in Singh.        
	Singh alluded to Varun Gandhis alleged anti-Muslim speech to say that a party that fielded nominees with such a mindset could not take the country forward.        
	Asked about Advanis proposal to debar Rajya Sabha members like him from becoming Prime Minister, Singh said: Indira Gandhi started as a member of the Rajya Sabha, (H.D. Deve) Gowda and (I.K.) Gujral were Rajya Sabha members. So long as the Indian Constitution remains what it is, Advani is not right.        
	He tangentially cited his heart surgery as one reason for not jumping into the election fray.        
	Singh made it clear the BJP was a bigger enemy than the Left: Communalism is the greater challenge today.        
	Would the Congress take Left support after the polls? We will cross the bridge when we come to it.        
	Advani hit back at a rally in Mathura, repeating that Singh was the weakest Prime Minister. If he (Singh) wanted to take a decision, he will send a minister to 10 Janpath and ask for clearance, PTI quoted him as saying.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            An Air India pilot and an air hostess on duty in Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 30: Executive pilots of the loss-making Air India today called off their five-day strike after the Centre deferred pay-cut plans even as it indicated that some sacrifice would have to be accepted.        
	Captain V.K. Bhalla, who led the group of 200-250 striking pilots, said they had decided to return to work after assurances from civil aviation minister Praful Patel that the cuts of up to 70 per cent in productivity-linked incentives, forming the bulk of their pay, would be kept in abeyance.        
	Patel also announced that a panel would be formed to look into cost cuts, but appeared to suggest that the exercise would eventually involve some form of pay cut.         
	The airline is going through a bad patch and everyone has to chip in with sacrifice, he said.         
	Air India spokesperson Jitender Bhargava said the pilots would resume work immediately, adding he expected international flights to become normal by tonight and domestic services by tomorrow.         
	We have already reopened the bookings (which had been suspended for 15 days), he said.         
	Today, 111 flights had to be cancelled before the strike was called off.        
	But relief for passengers, reeling from the cancellations in the middle of the festival season, appeared a day or two away as the pilots have to be moved to airports where planes have been parked. Officials said many of the pilots who had reported sick would have to undergo medical check-up.         
	The pilots decision to return to work came a day after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh intervened to stop the management from activating a shutdown plan even as the top brass of the state-owned airline warned the pilots of unspecified action.        
	Today, strike leader Bhalla took care to highlight Singhs role while declaring the strike was over. We have got an official communication from the minister (Patel) that things will be done according to the assurances given. We thank the Prime Minister for intervening in the issue.        
	Most of the airlines 1,200 pilots are members of the Indian Pilots Guild or the Indian Commercial Pilots Association and didnt join the strike. However, these pilots refused to fly beyond their normal roster duties, making many connections being flown by the striking executive pilots difficult to operate.         
	The airline needs to bring down its accumulated losses of Rs 7,200 crore to get government-backed loan guarantees and fresh capital.

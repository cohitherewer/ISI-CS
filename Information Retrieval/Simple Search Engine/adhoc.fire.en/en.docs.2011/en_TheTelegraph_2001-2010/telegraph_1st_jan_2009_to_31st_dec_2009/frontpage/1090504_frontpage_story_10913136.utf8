The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Karachi bar on Imran 
                                                                                                           Karachi bar on Imran 
                                Imran: Visit stopped                            
	Karachi, May 3 (Reuters): Pakistani authorities stopped Imran Khan from travelling to Karachi today because of fear his trip could trigger violence in the commercial hub.        
	Last week, at least 27 people were killed in clashes in Karachi between rival ethnic-based factions, another security worry for the country already battling a wave of Islamist militant violence.        
	Its shameful, the cricketer-turned-politician told reporters at the airport in Lahore where authorities stopped him from boarding a flight to Karachi. Under what law can they stop a Pakistani citizen going to Karachi? Isnt Karachi a city of Pakistan?        
	The violence in Pakistans biggest city resulted from tension between Mohajirs, the descendants of Urdu-speaking people who migrated from India after the Partition, and ethnic Pashtuns from the northwest. Imran, who heads his Tehrik-e-Insaaf party, is a Pashtun.        
	Tension in Karachi has been building as Mohajirs, who dominate the citys administration, have become suspicious of a Pashtun community that has strong Islamist sympathies, following a surge in militancy in the northwest.        
	Imran said he had been hoping to take a message of peace to Karachi, home to more than 16 million including the largest concentration of Pashtuns outside the North West Frontier Province, where a Taliban insurgency rages.        
	Were trying to forge unity among all ethnic groups but Altaf Hussein considers Karachi his property and stopped us, Imran said, referring to the chief of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) that represents the Mohajirs.        
	The MQM has been the dominant political force in Karachi for years. It is part of a provincial coalition government led by President Asif Ali Zardaris Pakistan Peoples Party.        
	The government of Sindh province, of which Karachi is capital, yesterday issued an order banning Imran from the province for a month.

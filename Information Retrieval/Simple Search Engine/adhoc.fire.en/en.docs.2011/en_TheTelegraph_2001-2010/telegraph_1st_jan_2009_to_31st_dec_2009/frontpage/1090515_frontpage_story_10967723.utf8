   CONG TRIES TO REGROUP ALLIES
				       RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                              
	New Delhi, May 14: Illness, fire or flood  misfortune is providing an excuse for the Congress to reconnect with estranged allies and reach out to potential ones as result day nears.        
	Where calamity did not strike, caffeine came in handy. Sonia Gandhi asked Sharad Pawar over for a cup of coffee at 10 Janpath last evening. Sonia, who has also kept in touch with Lalu Prasad, had called neighbour Ram Vilas Paswan after a fire broke out in the Union ministers 12 Janpath home yesterday.        
	Today, Digvijay Singh phoned Amar Singh to say how extremely concerned he had been to learn that the Samajwadi Party leader had recently been admitted to hospital in Uttarakhand.        
	Digvijay, a Congress general secretary, had attacked his Samajwadi counterpart throughout the campaign. This afternoon he tried to make up over the phone  in the presence of journalists in his room at the Congress headquarters  asking Amar to forget the bitterness of the past few months.         
	Amar appeared to refer to the alleged smutty campaign against the Samajwadi candidate from Rampur, Jaya Prada, and asked Digvijay why Congress nominee Begum Noor Bano had been silent about it. Digvijay told him the canards against the actress had been spread by the Samajwadis themselves. When your party members do this sort of thing, what do you expect me and the Begum to do?        
	Earlier this week, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had spoken to Nitish Kumar  a prime catch as an ally  ostensibly to clear the air over the use of central funds meant for flood victims.        
	The atmosphere in Delhi, however, is such that every meeting or conversation is being given a political twist.         
	A buzz was set off when Amar, a guest at this evenings wedding of Sudhanshu Trivedi, political aide to Rajnath Singh, sat down at the same table with the BJP chief, whether by design or coincidence. Rajnath said it had nothing to do with politics.        
	Pawar spent over half an hour with Sonia after the exit polls were telecast. Congress sources admitted to being shaken by reports from Mumbai that the Shiv Sena was making overtures to Pawar, having already offered to back him for Prime Minister.        
	Pawars party, however, played down the idea of staking claim to the top job. The NCP does not have such numbers where we can say that Sharad Pawar has to be Prime Minister, PTI quoted party leader Praful Patel as saying.        
	After the NDAs unity show in Ludhiana, the Congress has decided the UPA should be re-assembled in case the BJP insists the President invite the largest pre-poll alliance first. For the record, Lalu Prasad, Mulayam and Paswan have declared they are still in the UPA. But sources said it was a tough job to scout for new friends from May 16.        
	We have to get the right mediators to deal with Jayalalithaa and Mayavati, a source said. Ghulam Nabi Azad or Kamal Nath wont do. They (Jaya and Maya) will insist on speaking only to Sonia, Manmohan or Pranab Mukherjee. The problem is, if the talks fail, these leaders stand to lose face.        
	The Congress seems to have reached out to the Telengana Rashtra Samiti, which joined the NDA a few days ago. They are offering to drop Y.S.R. Reddy as chief minister, a TRS official said  a claim that could not be verified independently.        
	The Congress has also tapped actor Chiranjeevis Praja Rajyam Party in Andhra Pradesh. The carrot apparently is that if the Congress does not do well in the Assembly polls, Reddy would be axed in favour of a backward class chief minister.                    WITH INPUTS FROM G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

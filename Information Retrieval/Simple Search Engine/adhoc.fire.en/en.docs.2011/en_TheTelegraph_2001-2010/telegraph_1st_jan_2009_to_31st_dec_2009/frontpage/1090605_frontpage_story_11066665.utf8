  - Israel rebuke, US mistakes in Obama message to Muslims                                Obama in front of the Sphinx during a tour of Giza following his speech on Thursday. (AFP)                                  
	Cairo, June 4: Barack Obama today pledged to seek a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world, delivering one of the strongest condemnations of Israeli settlements in an audacious address that took him further than any US President in recent memory in conceding that America had sometimes been wrong.        
	I have come here to seek a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world; one based upon mutual interest and mutual respect; and one based upon the truth that America and Islam are not exclusive, and need not be in competition, Obama said at Cairo University. Instead, they overlap, and share common principles  principles of justice and progress, tolerance and the dignity of all human beings.        
	America is not and never will be at war with Islam, Obama told a worldwide audience of 1.5 billion Muslims, steering clear of the word terrorism but speaking out against extremism. We will, however, relentlessly confront violent extremists who pose a grave threat to our security, he said.        
	He dwelled upon Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan but reserved some of his sharpest words for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict without offering major initiatives on the West Asian peace process.        
	The speech in Cairo, which Obama called a timeless city, redeemed a promise he made nearly two years ago while running for President. It was, perhaps, the riskiest speech of his young presidency, and Obama readily conceded that not every goal would be easily or quickly achieved.        
	Obama offered few details for how to solve myriad problems and conflicts around the globe. But he referred to his biography  I am a Christian, but my father came from a Kenyan family that includes generations of Muslims  as a credible connection to his audience before which he referred to himself by his full name.        
	While the message touched upon a litany of challenges, it boiled down to simply this: Barack Hussein Obama was standing at the podium as the American President. I am also proud to carry with me the goodwill of the American people, and a greeting of peace from Muslim communities in my country: assalaamu alaykum, Obama said.        
	His message was sweeping and forceful  at times scolding and combative  promoting democracy in Egypt, warning Israelis against building new settlements, and acknowledging that the US had fallen short of its ideals, particularly in the Iraq war.         
	It also evoked a new and nuanced tone, and some of Obamas language drew appreciative applause from his audience of 3,000 invited guests at Cairo University. Several times, for instance, he spoke of Palestine, rather than the more ambiguous term often used by American leaders, future Palestinian state.        
	Obama did say that Americas bond with Israel, the source of much Arab distrust of the US, was unbreakable, and he rejected baseless, ignorant and hateful rants by those who deny the Nazi Holocaust. To underline his point, Obama is due to tour the former Nazi concentration camp at Buchenwald tomorrow.         
	But he also voiced compassion for the millions of Palestinians who have lived for decades under Israeli occupation in refugee camps in Gaza and the West Bank. Let there be no doubt: the situation for the Palestinian people is intolerable, he said.         
	While Israels hawkish government has not accepted a so-called two-state solution, Obama said: The only resolution is for the aspirations of both sides to be met through two states, where Israelis and Palestinians each live in peace and security. That is in Israels interest, Palestines interest, Americas interest, and the worlds interest. Too many tears have been shed; too much blood has been shed.        
	He also acknowledged that Hamas, the Islamic militant group in control of the Gaza Strip and which the US labels a terrorist organisation, does have some support among some Palestinians.        
	The President divided his speech into seven sections, often sounding like the university professor he was before he sought political office.        
	Some of his words are set to raise eyebrows in the US. Despite an uncompromising defence of Americas pursuit of al Qaida and of its invasion of Afghanistan, he went on to cast doubt on US actions in Iraq.         
	Unlike Afghanistan, Iraq was a war of choice that provoked strong differences in my country and around the world, Obama said. Although I believe that the Iraqi people are ultimately better off without the tyranny of Saddam Hussein, I also believe that events in Iraq have reminded America of the need to use diplomacy and build international consensus to resolve our problems whenever possible.        
	By contrast, he described Americas military presence in Afghanistan as a necessity after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.        
	Make no mistake: we do not want to keep our troops in Afghanistan, he said. We would gladly bring every single one of our troops home if we could be confident that there were not violent extremists in Afghanistan, and now Pakistan, determined to kill as many Americans as possible. But that is not yet the case.        
	Other surprising admissions include that in the middle of the Cold War, the United States played a role in the overthrow of a democratically elected Iranian government.        
	Some early response was promising  and not just that several times someone in Obamas audience in the domed hall yelled out, I love you!        
	 It was honest, is the first word that comes to mind, said Hossam Bahgat, an independent human rights activist who attended the speech. I think it was remarkable the speech left out the term terrorism completely, Bahgat said. It may have been a paradigm shift for the US, away from using this politically charged word.        
	However, analysts said, while Obamas strong words may resonate today on the Arab street, his future actions will be far more important.        
	For all the talk right now about how much President Bush alienated the Muslim world, Bush administration officials, from the president on down, publicly said nice things about America and Islam as well. In the early days after September 11  on September 20, 2001, George W. Bush had also delivered a stirring speech reaching out to Muslims.        
	Ultimately, policies matter more than words, many analysts said.

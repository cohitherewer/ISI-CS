The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | The jerk, later the scream
                                                                                                           The jerk, later the scream
                                            
	Ravi Kumar, 30, an engineer from Hyderabad, was travelling on the Coromandel Express from Kharagpur to Vijayawada. He narrated his experience to The Telegraph              
	I boarded the Coromandel Express at Kharagpur at 4.30pm, with a reservation on the sleeper coach S-6. The train left on time and reached Bhadrak on schedule a little after 7 in the evening.         
	I lay down on my side-upper berth as the train moved towards Cuttack, the next station an hour and a half away. It was moving at a fair speed.        
	I fell asleep when, a little after 7.45pm, I felt a massive jerk. Some more jerks followed and then the coach started shaking severely.         
	I jumped down from my berth and clutched the iron rods, as did my fellow passengers. We could not understand what had happened, but we realised the bogie had tilted to the left. We were all leaning on one side.        
	I was lucky I was not hurt. Some others were injured by the impact, hitting fans, rods or the berth frames. Children were crying, some were hurt and bleeding.        
	By now, smoke had enveloped the coach. Fearing that a fire may have broken out, we ran towards the exit, leaving our luggage behind. Getting out of the right door was impossible as the coach was almost touching the ground on the left. Luckily the left door was open, and we slowly moved out. The ground was just about a foot away.        
	It was pitch dark outside.         
	But even in the darkness, we sensed it was sheer providence that had saved us.         
	Our coach had tipped around 60 degrees, part of it was off the tracks.        
	Two bogies trailing us  S-7 and S-8  had met the same fate. Passengers were jumping out, trying to figure out what had happened.         
	The coaches at the rear of the train, mainly the airconditioned bogies, seemed all right.        
	We started moving forward, towards the engine.         
	S-5 had partially derailed, around 50 per cent of the coach was off the tracks.         
	Then the horror dawned upon us.        
	We saw a heap of coaches, one piled on top of the other. They were S-2, S-3 and S-4, the worst affected.        
	We could hear the cries of desperation of the people trapped inside. People were screaming for help, saying they were stuck between berths and luggage was tumbling all over them.        
	Ahead of them lay coach S-1 and two general bogies and then the engine, which had gone off the tracks. But they didnt appear as badly affected as the other three.        
	We were all shivering, wondering what to do. The one saving grace was that the accident had taken place about three kilometres away from Jajpur Road station, which the Coromandel would have crossed in about five minutes had it not derailed.         
	Around 10 minutes later, it seemed an eternity, we heard the shout of people. They were villagers who had heard the noise and had come rushing to help.         
	By then word had reached Jajpur and a rescue team was on its way.         
	Within an hour, ambulances had reached the site, along with police and railway officials who ringed the site.         
	The first lot to be rescued was from the coach on top of the heap. Soon, we heard that at least eight bodies had been recovered and two more had been spotted inside.         
	We trudged back to our bogies and started bringing out our luggage. Then we started walking towards the highway looking for road transport.         
	It was a miracle that had saved us.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Sharad faces Yadav heat
                                                                                                           Sharad faces Yadav heat
          NALIN VERMA                              
	Madhepura, April 26: In bhookh, they speak the same language, but not in vote.        
	The Kosi flood has been a great leveller making people from all castes take the same food  khichdi, chuda, gur  at relief camps for the past eight months. But then, this is a state where caste runs thicker than calibre.        
	Ironically, JD(U) president Sharad Yadav, despite being a Mandal messiah, is facing a tough time simply because Lalu Prasad is better placed in the heart of the numerically preponderant Yadavs in Madhepura.        
	The flood caused by a breach in the embankment of the Kosi at Kusaha (Nepal)  barely 30km from Madhepura  led water gushing into villages, destroying homes, damaging crops and killing cattle in five districts.         
	Now, vehicles ply at 100kmph on the 60km Madhepura-Banmankhi road, and schools, health sub-centres and panchayat buildings glow in solar lights along the road, thanks to the men, material and resources employed by the state government to prove that it believes in development and infrastructure re-building.        
	With all these, the ghost of a rigid caste system has also been resurrected. Voters are talking about caste as the criteria to cast their votes. Rome Pope ka, Madhepura gope ka (If Rome is identified with Pope, Madhepura is with the Yadavs) is dominating the lips of the Yadavs, who feel proud of their clan and for whom Lalu Prasad is the hero.        
	So what if Sharad is a Yadav? He is in Nitish Kumars JD(U), which the Madhepura Yadavs cannot identify with. We will vote for RJDs Ravindra Charan Yadav, former JNU student Jyoti Mandal said, adding: Development is not an issue. The pride of caste is.        
	The Yadavs also have found logic for preferring Lalu Prasad over Sharad. Lalu Prasad was first to reach with relief materials among us, said Sanjay Yadav at Sabeila Chowk village, ignoring better roads, revival of schools and health centres provided by the Nitish government in such a short period.        
	At least 40 per cent of voters in Madhepura  represented by Pappu Yadav in 2004  are the Yadavs, majority of whom prefers Lalu. Sharad is more dependent on the extreme backward classes (EBC), who have consolidated behind the JD(U)s development politics and also the upper castes, including the brahmins and Rajputs who have so far voted against Lalu and his Yadavisation.        
	However, it will not be easy for Sharad to rope in the upper castes this time for the resurgent Congress, which has got the backing of Pappu, has fielded a brahmin  Taranand Sada.

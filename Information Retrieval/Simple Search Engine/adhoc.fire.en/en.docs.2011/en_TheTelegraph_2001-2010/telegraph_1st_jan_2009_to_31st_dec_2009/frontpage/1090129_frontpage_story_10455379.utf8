The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Americans first shadow on H-1B route
                                                                                                           Americans first shadow on H-1B route
          K.P. NAYAR                            Hilda Solis                                  
	Washington, Jan. 28: With three million jobs expected to be scrubbed in the US this year as the economic crisis takes its toll, the H-1B route that brought tens of thousands of Indians to America is facing opposition that may prove terminal for the programme.        
	While the world is transfixed over the hopes springing from Barack Obamas expansive $825 billion economic recovery effort, a battle is raging in the US Senate over the new US presidents choice of a labour secretary who has said that local candidates must be considered for job openings in America before employers can recruit in countries like India.        
	While most of Obamas new cabinet members have already started work, the confirmation of Hilda Solis is being held up in a Senate committee as the result of an anonymous hold on her choice as labour secretary.        
	Solis said at her confirmation hearing in answer to a question posed by a Senator who supports the H-1B programme: I want to look at how certification occurs. I want to look at how the labour pool is identified. Whether it be in the surrounding area where that particular business may be looking and seeking for high tech individuals what extensive availability of information is there so we know, if before we go abroad, we are first prioritising those workers who are in fact capable and ready to fill these positions.        
	She elaborated that such priority in my mind would be fairness. First of all, looking at how we provide fairness for those individuals who are trained and who are here in this country. Put them first.        
	That the H-1B visa programme is quickly becoming a dirty word in the US also became obvious last week after a prominent Senator pounced on Microsoft, investigating if the company had laid off Indians and other foreign staff before getting rid of American workers.        
	After Microsoft announced a cut of 5,000 jobs, the first ever lay off for the computer conglomerate, Senator Charles Grassley wrote asking the companys CEO Steve Ballmer if it will be retaining H-1B workers and putting similarly qualified American workers out of their jobs.        
	I want to make sure employers recruit qualified American workers first before hiring foreign guest workers, Grassley wrote.        
	Last year, Microsoft was here on Capitol Hill advocating for more H-1B visas. These work visa programmes were never intended to allow a company to retain foreign guest workers rather than similarly qualified American workers, when that company cuts jobs during an economic downturn.        
	When Obama was campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, a big worry in India was that if elected president, he may clamp down on outsourcing of American jobs abroad.        
	But with 2.6 million US jobs lost last year and three million more likely to be axed in 2009, the focus has suddenly turned to the continuance of foreign guest workers here while unemployed Americans turn to welfare.        
	The Bush administration labour departments Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2006-2011 explicitly stated that H-1B workers may be hired even when a qualified US worker wants the job, and a US worker can be displaced from the job in favour of the foreign worker.        
	That policy is now under severe attack here. Republican Senator Grassley, along with Democrat Dick Durbin have moved a bill on Capitol Hill that would require employers to advertise job openings on a labour department web site before submitting an H-1B application.        
	In addition, the bill would authorise the labour department to conduct random audits of any company that uses the H-1B program and would mandate annual audits of companies with more than 100 employees that have 15 percent or more of H-1B workers.        
	The hold on clearing Solis, a Senate procedure that allows a single Senator to block action in the chamber, is not solely on account of H-1B. Solis, daughter of poor immigrant parents from Nicaragua and Mexico and the first in her family to go to college, has long been a champion of labour causes.        
	She angered pro-business Senators at her hearing by refusing to answer questions about her approach to the Employee Free Choice Act, a legislation that makes it easier for American workers to form, join, or assist trade unions, a law which she naturally favours.

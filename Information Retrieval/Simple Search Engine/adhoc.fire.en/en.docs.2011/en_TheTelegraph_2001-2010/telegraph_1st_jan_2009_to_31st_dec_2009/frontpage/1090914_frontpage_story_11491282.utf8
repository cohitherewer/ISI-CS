          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                     
	Imphal, Sept. 13: A procession following the hearse of a September 8 encounter victim today faced police teargas shells and mock bombs in Imphal after protesters took the Raj Bhavan route defying police instructions.         
	Md Majibur Rahaman, a Tata Sumo driver, was among six killed by police commandos last Tuesday.         
	Relatives, friends and well-wishers were carrying the body in a fleet of vehicles from the mortuary of the Regional Institute of Medical Sciences towards his home in Imphal East for the last rites when police launched the crackdown, around 2pm.         
	When the convoy reached the gate of Congress Bhawan in Imphal city, a large number of police personnel deployed there blocked the vehicles, asking them not to take the southern side of National Highway 39 that leads to Raj Bhavan and the chief ministers office complex.         
	The protesters were told to take the northern road of the highway which also leads to Rahamans home.         
	The procession, however, forced its way towards the southern road.         
	After driving for around 200 metres, as the vehicles were nearing the northern gate of Raj Bhavan, the police stopped the procession again.        
	When the protesters refused to turn back, the police fired tear gas shells and exploded mock bombs, forcing the convoy to take a U-turn.         
	Five persons, including a woman, sustained injuries after being hit by teargas shells and splinters of mock bombs.         
	The sound of teargas shells sent nearby shoppers into a tizzy.         
	As people began to run for cover, traffic came to a grinding halt for about half an hour.        
	The incident is likely to add to worries at a time when the state is grappling to quell the agitation sparked by th July 23 killings.        
	On September 8, besides, Rahaman, the police shot dead five persons  two riding a motorcycle and three others riding Rahmans Tata Sumo  at Awang Khunou Lamkhai along National Highway 53 in Imphal West.         
	We were taking the body in a peaceful manner. Why should the police act that way? This should be condemned. Though we are accepting the body, we are not calling off our agitation, a spokesman for the Rahaman joint action committee said.         
	The incident came about 45 minutes after the state paid tribute to the four jawans of the India Reserve Battalion who were killed in an ambush by cadres of the Peoples Liberation Army in Imphal East yesterday.         
	Chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh, Speaker S. Budhichandra Singh, ministers, MLAs and senior civil and police officials were part of the ceremony.         
	It was held at the 1st Manipur Rifle complex here, about 600 metres from the area where police turned back Rahamans convoy.         
	The Revolutionary Peoples Front, the political wing of the PLA, said the attack was unintentional. The cadres had mistaken the IRB team for security forces, the outfit said in a statement.

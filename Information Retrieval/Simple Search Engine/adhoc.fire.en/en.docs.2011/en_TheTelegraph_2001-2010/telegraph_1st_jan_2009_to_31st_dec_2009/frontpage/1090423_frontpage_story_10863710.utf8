The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Lalgarh election at a price
                                                                                                           Lalgarh election at a price
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	April 22: The Bengal government has agreed to virtually relinquish control over a 97sqkm swathe in Lalgarh for the time being so that voting can take place there on April 30.        
	Polling will take place in the four designated places instead of the usual 40, according to a compromise formula between the Election Commission, the state government and the Lalgarh tribal leadership which has shut the police out since late last year.        
	Security forces assisting the elections will now be penned up in the four places, which add up to 2.5sqkm, while the rest of the 100sqkm under tribal resistance will be out of bounds for them.        
	Lalgarh has been on the boil since November 6 when a backlash erupted against alleged police atrocities that followed a bomb attack targeting the chief ministers convoy. Fanned by Maoists, the unrest refused to die down.        
	Although the administrations writ had stopped running in the area for several months, the agreement today puts an official seal on the helplessness of a government unable to take any harsh decision for fear of a Nandigram-style backlash.        
	The administrative and security establishment of the state government was represented in strength at the tripartite meeting where it was decided to keep the forces on a tight leash.         
	West Midnapore district magistrate N.S. Nigam, police chief Manoj Verma, home department special secretary R.P. Banerjee, panchayat secretary Dilip Ghosh and backward classes department secretary Sukumar Banerjee attended the meeting.        
	In Calcutta, home secretary Ardhendu Sen said: When a government is faced with extraordinary situations, the response has to be different.        
	The states chief electoral officer said the 40 booths would be split and clustered together in polling centres in five schools  two in Lalgarh and one each in Bhimpur, Pirakata, and Ramgarh.         
	Asked if many of the 50,000 voters in the area would have to travel more, chief electoral officer Debashis Sen said: The booths will be within 5km of voters homes. The government said it would arrange buses for the voters.        
	Resistance leader Chhatradhar Mahato said he was satisfied with the outcome of the meeting.

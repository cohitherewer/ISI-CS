The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Desi dog has his day, with an Om
                                                                                                           Desi dog has his day, with an Om
  - Pat for the unusual pet          G.C. SHEKHAR                                                    
	Chennai, Aug. 30: There were only two conditions to participate in this dog show: your pet should be non-pedigreed and on a leash.        
	The unwritten rules were many, though. You should love them, and not care if they were undisciplined or stopped by to pee on a potted plant before walking up to the judges.        
	In its 25th year, Chennais very own and probably Indias only dog show for mongrels and cross-breeds on Sunday proved a barking hit.        
	The prizes were not for behaviour or breeding but for other loveable attributes, like having the curliest tail or wagging the tail the most, or the great survivor, or the lickiest tongue.        
	Lineage, grooming and kennel registration did not count. Its perfectly okay and even welcome if like Dusty, your dog too had been rescued from a shoebox left on the road.        
	Take the arthritic Whoopie, for example. She could still walk with a proud strut and when the owner asked her to say Om, she yawned producing exactly that sound.        
	The loudest cheers were reserved for Dusty, a seven-year-old brown mongrel, for being the hardiest survivor.        
	We rescued him from the street as a pup after he had lost his right eye in a road accident. Because of the handicap, he met with one more accident and barely survived, disfiguring his jaw. And yet he has proved a hardy guy and survives mostly on love and fresh air, declared Dustys owner Anjali Bhatia.        
	Even Chennais Airport Authority of India sent its candidate, the sprightly and well-trained Asha, discovered by the railway tracks but adopted by AAI officials and trained to be a sniffer dog.        
	Its a misconception that non-pedigree dogs cannot be trained or imparted special skills, said R. Sivashankar, a vet. This is probably the only dog show where the owners will ask each other from which street they had picked up their dog, said Chinni Krishna, chairman of animal welfare charity Blue Cross, which conducts the show.        
	Although we have nothing against the foreign breeds, the sense of pride in owning and loving Indian dogs is what gets recognised in our Well Dog Show. That this is our 25th edition is proof that our people are proud to own the mongrels and display them.        
	Admitting that the judges verdicts were purely subjective, Krishna explained that the idea was not to win but to participate and probably inspire others to adopt a stray mongrel. This edition of the dog show was unique since 30 of the 80 entries were done through Twitter and Facebook.        
	Now that our dog show is known in the cyber world, we expect the next edition to be even more crowded, hoped Narayan Hariharan, a marketing consultant in the blogging sector who has among the highest Twitter followings in India.              
	By the time the prizes were announced, the 20-odd cute mongrel pups kept in baskets by Blue Cross had been adopted by kids who pleaded, cajoled or threw tantrums to get their reluctant parents to take them home. So they will be back next year as participants.

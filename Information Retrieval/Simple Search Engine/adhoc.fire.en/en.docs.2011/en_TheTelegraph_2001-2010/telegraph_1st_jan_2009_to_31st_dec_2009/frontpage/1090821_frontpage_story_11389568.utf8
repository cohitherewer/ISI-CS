	Beijing, Aug. 20: Lead pollution from a newly opened and unlicensed manganese smelter has poisoned more than 1,300 children in southeastern Chinas Hunan province, state-run media said today.        
	This is the second incident of mass lead poisoning in the past month.        
	Officials in Wenping, 1,561km south of Beijing, shut down the smelter, the Wugang Fine-Processed Manganese Smelting Factory, last week and detained two of its owners after about a thousand local residents protested the poisoning, the China Daily reported. The plants general manager remains at large.        
	Tests since then have found elevated levels of lead in the blood of 1,354 children, or about 7 in 10 children who were examined, the official news agency, Xinhua, reported. The severity of the poisoning cannot be measured without further testing.        
	Lead poisoning damages the nervous and reproductive systems and can permanently cripple childrens growth and intellectual development.         
	The report of poisoning in Wugang followed a similar incident in Shaanxi province where state news reports say 851 children living near the nations fourth-largest smelter have tested positive for lead poisoning. More than 170 have since been hospitalised.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Sourav, a better bowler?
                                                                                                           Sourav, a better bowler?
  - Mathematician offers way to judge overall performance at one go          G.S. MUDUR                            Sourav exults after taking Rahul Dravids wicket at a match during the first IPL season                                         
	New Delhi, April 4: Sourav Ganguly may have performed better as a bowler than as a batsman during IPL 2008 matches, according to a South African mathematician who has proposed a new way of displaying cricketers performances.        
	Paul van Staden of the University of Pretoria has combined conventional measures used to evaluate bowling and batting performances to create graphical displays for quick  and relatively easy  comparisons.        
	The graphs provide a simple way of comparing bowling and batting performances and quickly identifying different types of players  offensive batsmen, bowling all-rounders, batting all-rounders or economical bowlers, Staden said.        
	Traditional comparisons use complex tables that list players and their scores on several ratios  bowling average, economy rate and strike rate for bowlers, and batting average and strike rate for batsmen.        
	For bowlers, the ratios depend on the number of balls bowled, wickets taken and runs conceded; and for batsmen, the ratios depend on the number of balls faced, dismissals and runs scored.        
	The tabular method of comparing players has problems. It is simply impossible to order players by more than one ratio in a single table. And there are three ratios for bowlers; just two for batsmen, Staden told The Telegraph.                    
	Staden has proposed a third ratio for batsmen  survival rate, or the number of balls faced per completed innings (or per dismissal)  and used the six ratios to analyse the performance of 12 batsmen and bowlers during IPL 2008.        
	The graphs have thrown up some surprising findings, said Staden, who has described his technique of assessing cricketers in the journal Current Science, published by the Indian Academy of Sciences.        
	The analysis shows that Sourav did better as a bowler than as a batsman in IPL 2008. He was the most economical bowler, conceding the least number of runs per ball he bowled. He gave away only 106.67 runs per 100 balls  a figure even lower than IPL 2008s highest wicket-taker Sohail Tanvirs 107.69.        
	As a renowned batsman in all forms of the game, it would have been expected that he would perform best in terms of batting. However, he performed much better as bowler and ended up as the most economical bowler in the IPL, Staden said.        
	He said Mohammad Asifs poor bowling performance was also surprising, especially since he was an integral part of the successful Pakistani squad in the Twenty20 World Championship in 2007.        
	The graphs have also identified Yusuf Pathan and Virender Sehwag as offensive batsmen, Shaul Pollock as a bowling all-rounder, Yusuf Pathan as a batting all-rounder, and Sourav, Tanvir, Pollock, and Irfan Pathan as economical bowlers.        
	Staden said the graphs, which he had adapted from a proposal first made in 1993 by a UK mathematician, A. Kimber, could be applied to other formats of cricket and not just to Twenty20 matches.        
	If a player whose key task in the team is to bowl performs as expected, he should appear on the lower left-hand corner of the graph displaying bowling ratios. His batting ratios will also appear on the lower left-hand corner of the graph if, as expected, his batting performance is poor.        
	But a player whos selected as a batsman and performs in keeping with that billing should appear on the upper right-hand corner of the graphs showing both his batting and bowling ratios.        
	A top all-rounder should have low bowling ratios and high batting ratios  so he should appear on the lower left-hand corner in the bowling graph and upper right hand corner in the batting graph.

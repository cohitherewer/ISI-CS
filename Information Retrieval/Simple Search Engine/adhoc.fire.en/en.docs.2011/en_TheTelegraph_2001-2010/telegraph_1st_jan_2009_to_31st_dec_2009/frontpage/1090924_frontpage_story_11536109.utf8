          G.C. SHEKHAR                             The Oceansat-2 streaks across the sky after the launch on Wednesday. (AFP)                                  
	Sriharikota, Sept. 23: Indias space scientists had many reasons to celebrate after their ocean satellite was successfully placed in orbit today. So did fishermen.        
	The Oceansat-2, put into space by the PSLV 720km above the earth, is equipped with an eight-band Ocean Colour Monitor, an apparatus that can accurately forecast movement of fish.        
	The 960kg Oceansat-2, which travelled to its destination in what was Indian workhorse satellite launcher PSLVs 15th successive and successful mission, will also help fishermen by relaying information on the distance and direction they must travel. It will also have data on the depth at which they can find their catch.        
	Oceansat, by mapping the movement of chlorophyll in the sea, can figure out the schools of fish that move along with it. At the same time, it can also caution fishermen about toxic algae blooms inimical to fish. So they will be advised not to fish in such areas, S.S. Navalgund, director of the Space Application Centre which is under Isro, said.         
	The success of Oceansat-1, Oceansat-2s predecessor launched in May 1999, in spooling out such crucial information had helped fishermen save a lot in diesel costs and increase their catch.         
	The information relayed by the satellite to Indian National Ocean Information Services at Hyderabad is analysed, translated into local languages and transmitted to fishing harbours across the country. Fishermen get the information on a display board and plan their trips accordingly. Since schools of fish travel fast, this data has to be relayed in real time, said K. Radhakrishnan director of Vikram Sarabahai Space Institute.         
	A survey of 700 fishing vessels in three states revealed that the Oceansat-1 data had helped fishermen save up to Rs 6 lakh in the past three years through lesser diesel use, Radhakrishnan said.        
	Space Application Centres Navalgund echoed him. Even fishermen in a place like Lakshadweeps Kavaratti had reported increased catches going by Oceansat-1s data, Navalgund said.         
	With Oceasat-2, things promise to get better. The satellite has a more powerful monitor that can capture images of a swathe 1,420km wide at a resolution of 360 metres during each pass.        
	The benefits dont end with a good catch, though. Oceansat-2 can also improve the accuracy in weather forecasts thanks to its scatterometer, an instrument to measure wind speeds on ocean surface by monitoring the capillary effect produced by waves. This will help in providing accurate predictions of weather and cyclones, Navaglund added.        
	Similarly, ROSA, the onboard GPS receiver built by the Italian space agency, will measure temperature and humidity on the ocean surface, helping calculate carbon dioxide absorption by the seas and the effects of global warming.        
	Isro chairman G. Madhavan Nair focused on the PSLVs string of successes. Today marks the 16th birthday of the PSLV launch, when the first launch of PSLV-D1 on September 23, 1993, failed. But after that, every mission involving the PSLV has been a 100 per cent success. In this sense, it falls into the same bracket as other launchers like Europes Ariane, Nasas Delta and Russias Soyuz.

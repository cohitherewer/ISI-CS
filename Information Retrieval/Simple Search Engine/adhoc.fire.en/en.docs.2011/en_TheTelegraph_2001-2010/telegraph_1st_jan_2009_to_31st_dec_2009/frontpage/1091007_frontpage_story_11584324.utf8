          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranchi, Oct. 6: Governor K. Sankaranarayanan today ordered a vigilance probe into charges of nepotism and corruption against Jharkhand Public Service Commission (JPSC) chairman Dilip Prasad and two other members  Gopal Prasad Singh and Shanti Devi.        
	Raj Bhavan spokesperson S.N. Jha said that the two faced charges of misusing their official position to make appointments to various posts.        
	Sankaranarayanan ordered the vigilance probe after the Union home ministry sent back his predecessor Syed Sibtey Razis recommendation to the President for investigations by a Supreme Court judgeinto the alleged bungling in appointments.        
	The Centre wanted the state to send evidence to substantiate the charges. However, according to sources, the state failed to do so.        
	Razi had referred the charges levelled against Prasad and member Singh to the President. They were charged with favouring their relatives and friends during appointments of civil servants and lecturers. The vigilance bureau has been asked to probe into the charges and legal action will be taken under the Prevention of Corruption Act if the charges are substantiated, a source said. Notably, Singh retired yesterday.         
	The charges are based on a memorandum of the Jharkhand BET-NET Association, which questioned appointments of 239 civil servants and 1,044 lecturers.        
	Prasad was made the officiating chairman of JPSC on September 22, 2004, after former JPSC chairman P.C. Hembroms term expired.                    
	Singh, a reader in history in Godda College, was made a JPSC member on July 31, 2003. He is alleged to have recommended selection of over a dozen candidates at the JET exams conducted by the JPSC. The beneficiaries reportedly happen to be closely related to him.

	New Delhi, Dec. 27: The final  and dead  one-day international between India and Sri Lanka was laid to rest on a hair-transplant wicket at the Ferozeshah Kotla after match officials and the two captains decided the pitch was too dangerous.         
	The incident is a potential threat to Delhi hosting 2011 World Cup matches because under International Cricket Council rules, it could be banned for 12 to 24 months.        
	Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) officials found no time to duck under the bouncer that flew at them from the Kotla with the entire ground and pitch committee led by former Test player Chetan Chauhan resigning.        
	The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) disbanded its grounds and pitches committee, headed by Daljit Singh, responsible for guiding the DDCA and approving decisions connected with relaying the pitch.        
	DDCA chief and BJP leader Arun Jaitley and other officials found themselves at the receiving end of hai, hai shouts from the capacity crowd that threw bottles and chairs on the ground.        
	Sunil Gavaskar had described the wicket before the match thus: Its a hair-transplant pitch with bald patches and some patches of grass.        
	It turned out to be a hair-raising pitch for Tillekaratne Dilshan, who has tormented India through this winter. He took a nasty blow above the elbow guard. Sanath Jayasuriya, who was struck too, now has the distinction of participating in two abandoned one-day matches.        
	On December 25, 1997, another Sri Lanka-India ODI was called off, in Indore.         
	At 11.20am, after a ball in the 24th over from debutant medium pacer Sudeep Tyagi reared to fly past Thilina Kandamby, visiting captain Kumar Sangakkara rushed to the middle to ask his two batsmen  M. Pushpakumara was the other  to stop playing. Lanka was 83 for 5.                     
	Sangakkara also had a word with M.S. Dhoni and the umpires. Quick to join them on the pitch were match referee Alan Hurst, Kotla curator Vijay Bahadur Mishra, Daljit Singh, Chauhan and the two coaches  Gary Kirsten and Trevor Bayliss.         
	For an hour, efforts were made to resume play without success. In any case, the series was already settled.         
	Later, Hurst said: The decision to abandon the match was taken by myself in consultation with the on-field umpires, Marais Erasmus and Shavir Tarapore, and both captains as it was clear that the pitch had extremely variable bounce and was too dangerous for further play.         
	Gavaskar agreed. Playing was dangerous, and physical safety of the players is important. Players like Jeff Thomson had the natural ability to bounce the ball, but here it was a different case.        
	In Gavaskars time, however, batsmen were not cocooned in protective gear as now and often played on treacherous pitches against express pace.         
	Jaitley promised refund. We regret the inconvenience caused.... We offer our apologies.        
	Chauhan tried to blame the BCCI, saying the parent body was consulted at every step before relaying the pitch. But the DDCA itself was split.        
	While association veterans, including former curator Radhey Shyam, had asked the officials not to use the new pitch, others, like Chauhan, did not agree.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | We will never surrender, say Tigers
                                                                                                           We will never surrender, say Tigers

	Colombo, April 21 (Reuters): The Tamil Tiger rebels will never surrender, the head of the separatists peace secretariat told Reuters today, despite their being outgunned in an apparent final offensive by the Sri Lankan military.        
	Seevaratnam Puleedevan, secretary-general of the LTTE peace secretariat, urged the international community to intervene by forcing a permanent ceasefire, which Sri Lanka has ruled out.         
	The military says around 50,000 people have fled the Tiger-held area so far since yesterday. It had given the LTTE until noon today, a deadline already passed, to surrender or be destroyed. The LTTE will never surrender and we will fight and we have the confidence that we will win with the help of the Tamil people, Puleedevan told Reuters by telephone. He said he was near the border of the no-fire zone in Sri Lankas northeastern coast.        
	The LTTE is surrounded there by around 50,000 troops expected to soon deal a final blow to the Tigers, who have waged war since 1983 to create a separate state for Sri Lankan Tamils. LTTE leader Vellupillai Prabhakaran was inside the no-fire zone, Puleedevan said.        
	He is with us and he is directing the war against the Sri Lankan armed forces and providing a lot of support and assistance to the people, Puleedevan said.        
	The LTTE founder created its culture of committing suicide by taking cyanide in case of capture, and of pioneering suicide bombing as a weapon of war. The latter has landed the LTTE on US, EU, Indian and Canadian terrorist lists.        
	Puleedevan accused the military of using Tamil civilians as human shields, an accusation the UN, a host of western countries and people who have escaped LTTE-held areas have made against the rebels. The time is running out for the international community to intervene, because you know that a bloodbath is going to happen, he said.        
	Military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara categorically rejected the accusation. We have never used civilians as human shields. We were on the other side and the LTTE was shooting and killing people and using them as human shields. We went in and rescued them. How can anyone say we were using civilians as human shields? he said.         
	The UN and witnesses who have escaped Tiger areas have repeatedly said the LTTE was shooting people who try to flee and forcing others including children as young as 15 to fight.        
	People are giving full support to us and they are fighting with us, because the LTTE is fighting for them, Puleedevan said. Thats why they are voluntarily joining and fighting with us. We are not taking any children with us in our armed forces.        
	Sri Lankas air force yesterday released video taken from an unmanned drone showing what it said were people streaming out of the no-fire zone and congregating by the thousands at an army reception centre just outside of it.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Firm in city, lax on fringes
                                                                                                           Firm in city, lax on fringes
  - Cops: 1700, caught: 2 autos        OUR BUREAU                                                    
	The state government has begun a crackdown on old private commercial vehicles, making 11 seizures on Saturday in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area.         
	Over 1,700 police personnel were on the ground, enforcing the ban in most of the city but letting illegal autorickshaws ply unhindered in Tollygunge.         
	The Telegraph answers your questions on how the day unfolded and what lies ahead.                
	Did Saturdays action signal the government is serious about implementing the court order?         
	If the entire Calcutta Metropolitan Area (map on Page 7) is considered, the effort of the government can at best be termed half-hearted. But in the case of Calcutta, it appears that the police made a firmer effort. Very few autos plied in the city, fearing that their vehicles would be seized.        
	In contrast, two-stroke autos openly plied in areas like Tollygunge and Garia in South 24-Parganas, even though they are considered a part of the city. South 24- Parganas police said raids had been carried out, but no banned autos could be found.        
	However, Calcutta police will find it difficult to set aside 1,700 personnel every day to enforce the ban. The weekend, when fewer policemen are required for normal policing duties, also helped. But Monday could be another story.        
	Was there violence?        
	Only sporadic incidents in Tollygunge where auto drivers, mainly belonging to the Trinamul-backed unions, shattered the windscreens of four government buses and threatened some motorists. But Trinamul denied any hand in the violence.        
	Why was it less violent than in January when some autos were seized?        
	It is early days yet. Last time, organised violence had broken out on the third day.        
	But the Trinamul-led Auto Bachao Committee claims that our leader (Mamata Banerjee) has instructed that they desist from any violence.        
	Trinamul leader Sobhande Chattopadhyay said: We do not want a violent confrontation on this issue. We have realised that violence will not solve the problem. Something would have happened if we had forcibly brought out the autos. This ban has to be resisted using democratic methods. That is the message from our leader.        
	The same committee had unleashed violence on the streets of Calcutta in January. Today, Swarnakamal Saha, who heads the umbrella body of all transport unions, is the Trinamul candidate from Bowbazar Assembly seat, said a Trinamul leader. It would hardly send out the right signal if our unions went on the rampage now.        
	But the police are keeping their fingers crossed.        
	Did the government help commuters?         
	The government said 600 more buses were put on the roads. But many buses were bursting at the seams, even though it was Saturday when many schools and offices were closed  a factor that helped avert a crisis.        
	It was not easy for the commuters and many had to pay extra. Several private cars and taxis ran shuttle services, charging sums higher than on other days.        
	Why were the seizures so few?        
	In the city, there were very few banned vehicles on the streets. Banned buses, minibuses and taxis will stay off the roads till a special leave petition comes up in the Supreme Court on Tuesday.        
	In the adjoining areas, police inaction ensured that the number of vehicles seized was confined to five.        
	Why did so many illegal autos ply in Tollygunge?         
	Lax policing. There is an impression that the government wanted to focus its energy on the corporation area, possibly to convince the court that it was doing a good job and where the administration knew it would be difficult to avoid media glare.        
	Even though Tollygunge and Garia are in Calcutta for all practical purposes, they fall under South 24-Parganas police, which treated them as any other remote part of the district. No task force was formed and no special team was constituted to enforce the auto ban.        
	What about Monday?        
	The real challenge for the government will begin then. The administration is planning to deploy another 600 buses (1,200 more, including Saturdays 600 additional vehicles) on Monday, sourced largely from long-distance routes. Buses could be sought from neighbouring states if the situation worsens.        
	Monday will trigger another problem. Around 300 contract carriages  pool cars and school buses  will go off the streets.         
	Students may face some problems, said transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury.         
	The government also fears a prolonged agitation if the Supreme Court rules against the transport lobby. Trinamul is preaching non-violence but it remains to be seen how long it will be able to rein in unions that have been brought up on a culture of lawlessness before which the government has often blinked.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Balco rescue continues
                                                                                                           Balco rescue continues
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Raipur, Sept. 24: It will take experts two more days to clear the debris of a chimney that collapsed at Bharat Aluminium Company Limiteds (Balco) plant in Korba yesterday, killing 24. More than three dozen workers are still feared trapped.        
	District officials believe that it will take four more days to clear the debris. However, we have asked them to finish the work in two days as the victims are running out of time, said Chhattisgarh home minister Nankiram Kanwar.        
	Rescue teams are struggling to cut and clear the mangled metal and iron rods. We are cutting through metal and that is slowing us down, said a senior official, supervising the rescue. Once the debris is cleared, the final toll can be assessed. People are trapped in what remains of the two storerooms on which the chimney fell, the official said.         
	Experts from Southeastern Coalfield Limited have joined the mission. After experts came in, the debris was moved in a systematic fashion, said Korba collector Ashok Agrawal.         
	The toll today unofficially rose to 32 though officials still maintained that it was 24. It will be premature to talk of casualty, said chief minister Raman Singh.         
	Singh inspected the site today. He criticised company officials for fleeing the spot and not helping in the rescue operation. This point will be included in the judicial probe, he added.        
	Balco officials, however, denied the allegation. Senior company officials are present at the site and helping the administration, said chief of corporate communications B.K. Sriwastava.

	Ranchi, April 21: Sonia Gandhi today reiterated that the country faced threats from forces within, trying to divide it in the name of religion.        
	The country not only faces a threat from outside terrorists but also from communal forces trying to divide the people in the name of religion, the Congress president said, addressing a well-attended election rally here on the last day of campaigning for the second phase of the Lok Sabha polls on April 23.        
	The Congress talks about the welfare of all sections of society but there are some people who are trying to break the country in the name of religion. Hindus, Muslims, Christians want to live in peace and want two square meals a day, she said.        
	A similar statement by her in Khunti on April 11 had created a controversy. The BJPs prime ministerial candidate, L.K. Advani, sought an apology from Sonia for saying that the country faced a threat from within.        
	Sonias renewed stand was not unexpected as Congress nominee Subodh Kant Sahay was locked in a direct contest with BJPs Ramtahal Chaudhary in Ranchi.        
	In her 15-minute speech, she, however, was soft on growing Naxalism, saying some youths were misguided. Violence only hurts society and the country; it is no solution to any problem, she said, appealing to youths to shun violence and join the mainstream.        
	Sonia sought a fresh mandate for Sahay for having fulfilled her promise to revive the ailing Heavy Engineering Corporation (HEC). I had promised to revive HEC and the company is on its way to becoming a mini-Navratna, she said to a cheering crowd of over 10,000  comprising a good number of HEC employees and their family members  at Shahid ground on the HEC campus.         
	The revival of ailing HEC is an example of our industrial policy, which said that no company would be put on sale, she maintained. HEC, called the Mother of Industries, happened to be the dream project of Jawaharlal Nehru. She also reiterated that development projects would take off only after the displaced were rehabilitated.         
	Sonia also tried to connect with first-time voters and reminded them that it was her late husband Rajiv Gandhi who reduced the age of voting to 18. Youths can contribute to development of the nation and creating social harmony.        
	As expected, Sonia was silent on the functioning of the states UPA governments  those led by Madhu Koda and Shibu Soren  the Congress supported for three years. If the Congress and JMM nominees are facing anti-incumbency ire, it is because of the misdeeds of several ministers in the Koda and Soren cabinets.        
	She only said that the Centre had sanctioned huge funds for various projects in Ranchi, like the ring road, traffic and slum development. The Centre also sanctioned Rs 250 crore to set up an Indian Institute of Management.

  - Surrendered rebel of Daimary faction reveals hideout location in Kokrajhar        OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Kokrajhar, Nov. 15: Confessions by two surrendered militants led security forces today to a huge cache of explosives, arms and ammunition inside Ripu Chirang reserve forest bordering Bhutan in Kokrajhar district suspected to belong to the Ranjan Daimary faction of the National Democratic Front of Boroland.        
	The arms include 15 grenades of different makes  one made in Pakistan  timers, two IEDs, three FM radio receivers, 156 detonators, a US-made auto pistol and three country-made pistols, besides ammunition.         
	A police source said security personnel carried out the operation after two NDFB cadres, Jaikhlong Gwra Brahma and Suren Basumatary alias Sudem, who surrendered before Kokrajhar superintendent of police P.K. Dutta last Friday revealed about such a consignment hidden in the area.         
	The two had also disclosed about the presence of a camp in the area but it was not found during the operation. The militants might have shifted the camp and moved to some other area. We, however, managed to recover the consignment, a senior police official said.         
	The Kokrajhar superintendent of police said there was information about NDFB rebels ferrying consignments of arms and explosives from Bangladesh into the district to carry out strikes.         
	There is a possibility of presence of more such consignments in the Tipkai area bordering Dhubri district, he said.         
	Todays recovery was the second in the district in recent times.         
	On October 20, security forces recovered an AK-47 series rifle, two Bulgarian-made 9mm pistols, one 7.65 US made pistol, one country-made carbine, 15kg IED, 2kg gun powder, 120 live ammunition, including 28 rounds of AK, 47 rounds of 9mm pistol, 23 rounds of 7.65, eight rounds of 7.62, six magazines, 28 gelatine sticks and 11 metal arrows from Shoshanghutu near Mornai tea estate under Gossaigaon police in the district.         
	Even as security forces kept the pressure on the NDFB, the outfits president, Ranjan Daimary, alias D.R. Nabla, today extended support to the Maoist rebels who are fighting against oppression.         
	In a statement on the occasion of the foundation day of Boroland Army, Daimary said: The NDFB would like to congratulate the Maoists for fighting for their legitimate rights and on behalf of the exploited Bodo people I would like to extend every possible help to fight the ruling cliques of India.         
	Everywhere there is hue and cry that India is shining and developing. But are shining and development a reality in India? Who are the beneficiaries of shining and development? he said, asking whether development was only for the privileged class.         
	Daimary also cautioned his men to discharge their duties carefully, saying: The Boroland army must be very careful so that innocent civilians, particularly children and women, do not become the victims of our liberation war.

                                                                                                           DSP guard killed in rebel encounter
          SHAHNAWAZ AKHTAR                              
	Giridih, March 18: Deputy superintendent of police Rajendra Singhs bodyguard got killed in a late night encounter with Maoists yesterday,         
	Superintendent of police A.V. Minz had received a tip-off at 8.30pm that 30-35 Maoists are camping in Bhaluwahi, Birni, about 20km from the district headquarters.         
	Minz, along with Singh and a company of CRPF, rushed to the spot to take on the Maoists. But before police could reach the exact location, the rebels opened fire and Minzs bodyguard Surendra Mahto, who was walking ahead of the team, received a bullet on his head and died on the spot. Singh, who was moving behind Mahto, received minor injuries on his leg.        
	Mahto was a resident of Sinduri, Hazaribagh.         
	The encounter lasted for an hour and we fired around almost a hundred rounds. But the Maoists managed to escape, said Minz. The police could only recover some food-grain and utensils from the rebel hideout.        
	Sources said that it was ironic that the police had planned to trap the rebels and instead lost their own man. Minz does not feel that the incident was a trap laid out by the rebels. I dont think that is possible, as the information was right, he said. Later the police took five persons into custody for interrogation.         
	As the incident has taken place before the 15th Lok Sabha elections, it has raised security issues and concerns over Maoist presence in the district.

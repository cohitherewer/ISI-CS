  - Cricketer campaigns for others, Moradabad Cong leaders in token show          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN IN MORADABAD                            Azharuddin with wife Sangeeta at a Moradabad party meet. (PTI)                                        
	Politics has taught Mohammad Azharuddin, him of the wristy elegance, something he hardly ever did with a bat. Slog.        
	Azhar hasnt watched a single Indian Premier League match this season  not even the games featuring his favourite and home team, the Deccan Chargers of Hyderabad. Instead, the former India skipper is diligently keeping to a 7am-to-midnight campaign schedule, punctuated only by lunch and  unlike cricket  dinner breaks.        
	It has helped the Congress achieve a part of its objective in fielding him from Moradabad.        
	He has become the partys star campaigner in Uttar Pradesh. Hes in demand everywhere and the Congress is gaining a lot from his presence, claimed Khalique-ur-Rehman, Azhars brother-in-law and election agent.        
	However, Rehman, who is also general secretary of the Andhra Pradesh Congress, is a trifle worried about Azhars out-of-town forays to campaign for other party candidates. It might hurt his own campaign in Moradabad, a predominantly rural constituency, Rehman believes. Teamwork is fine but dont throw your wicket away, he seems on the verge of suggesting.        
	As Jamal Nasir, the former Moradabad Congress president, explained: Every minute is precious because Azhar has to cover more than 1,200 villages. Our partys grassroots committees are defunct because 1980 was the last time we had our MP here. These cant be revived overnight. So Azhar must slog it out on his own to register himself on the peoples minds.        
	The cricketers celebrity status and his unaffected manner has won over audiences at public meetings and roadshows. But like the Moradabad Congress, Azhar himself is sceptical whether the adulation would translate into votes.        
	A regularly repeated line in his speeches is: You will have to prove your love for me through your votes. Then I shall be convinced that all this is for real.        
	Azhars only big political dilemma has been sartorial. The party suggested he wear only kurta-pyjamas but the cricketer  once known for his expensive tastes -- made it clear he would stick to his jeans, T-shirt, sports shoes and dark glasses.        
	At a meeting at Tanda in the neighbouring Rampur seat, where he was canvassing for Begum Noor Bano, he forgot to remove his dark glasses till the crowd asked him to.        
	He, however, makes it a point to switch to kurta-pyjamas when he prays at the mosque every Friday. He is also careful to sign autographs in Urdu, especially when the seeker is a maulana.        
	But Azhar, his friends said, is circumspect about projecting himself as a Muslim leader.        
	We wanted to consolidate the Muslim votes, and we have done it. Now we are focused on the Hindu and Christian votes. Azhar addressed a meeting in a church, said Saeed Jamal Naseer, a businessman friend from Delhi.        
	He is reaching out to Hindus, and Sangeeta (Bijlani, his former-actress wife) is mainly going to the Hindu areas. He is stressing on the Ganga-Jamni culture of this area.        
	Like many big-leaguers ambling into politics, the cricketer had at first been reluctant to contest, Azhars biographer and aide Anas Baqai claimed. But he was persuaded by his friends and well-wishers, who cited how Uttar Pradesh had been a happy hunting ground for him as a batsman.        
	He made his highest Test score in Kanpur (199 against Sri Lanka in December 1986), and played three good Test matches there. He has had a fan following in the state ever since, said the Kanpur-born Baqai.        
	Saeed said he convinced Azhar about how important it is for young, progressive Muslims with an iconic status to be in the national political mainstream so that the community becomes aspirational instead of staying hidebound.        
	Once Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi offered the seat, Azhars mind was made up. Saeed said Azhar had wanted Meerut or Tonk in Rajasthan but the local units werent keen. A public meeting the cricketer addressed in Meerut, 112km from Moradabad, received lukewarm response, a Congress member said.        
	The people of Meerut are into hard-core politics. Even Muslims vote on caste lines and would have first convinced themselves that Azharbhai belonged to the right caste before endorsing his candidature, said Imran Ali, a local journalist.        
	We Moradabadis are simple folks. We are mostly labourers in the brassware units. And if someone is a bit responsive to our problems, we are ready to worship him for life.        
	Azhar has apparently not been found wanting on sympathy. But, Saeed said, the apolitical cricketer has over the past weeks acquired enough savvy to tell a genuine petitioner from a favour-seeker, as he once read a googly from a leg-break.        
	He has met delegations of rickshaw-pullers who sought low-cost housing and medical insurance. He has promised health insurance to the brassware workers who are prone to TB. But he politely declined to entertain brass exporters, Saeed said, although Azhar and his family have been staying in the guesthouse of a city businessman.        
	Many Moradabadis are thrilled that they have a candidate who came without baggage or an agenda. Except for the citys Congress. Many local leaders had been eyeing the party ticket and know that if Azhar wins, their future is sunk.        
	Azhars campaign is being run by a non-local team of Rehman, Saeed, Baqai and Faiz. If local Congressmen were spotted in his office, it was more to register an appearance than get involved in the nuts and bolts of electioneering, sources said.        
	Azhars closest rival, Rajiv Channa of the BSP, is playing up the local versus outsider factor and claims that maths is on his side.        
	The 2.25 lakh Dalit votes and the 70,000 Punjabi votes (Channa is one) and 40 to 50 per cent of the Muslim votes give him a 1.5 lakh lead over Azhar, said Humayun Qadir, his main strategist. Azhar has goodwill galore and lots of Muslim support.

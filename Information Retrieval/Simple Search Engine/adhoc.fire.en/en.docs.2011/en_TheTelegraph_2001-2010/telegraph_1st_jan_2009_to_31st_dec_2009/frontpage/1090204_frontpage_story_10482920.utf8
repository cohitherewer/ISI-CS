	New Delhi, Feb. 3: Sound out Jitendra Kumar Molas friends and relatives, and none can believe he could have changed so much as to keep the capital on high alert for almost six hours.        
	Described by neighbours as someone with a perpetual smile on his face, Mola shocked all who knew him on Sunday when he was shown on TV being led away from Delhi airport for threatening to hijack Indigo Flight 6E334.        
	Mola is in judicial custody till February 16 and could be given life imprisonment, if convicted.        
	A chartered accountant by profession, Mola lives with his parents and wife in flat No. 662 in the Air Force-Naval Officers Enclave for retired officers in Dwarka Sector 7. In the three years he has stayed there, residents have not once heard of him being aggressive or seen such acts by him.        
	His father, Air Commodore (retired) Ashok Kumar, appeared shocked when he visited his son in jail today.         
	He was too shocked to say anything. He just kept repeating that he had never seen his son like this before, said an officer who met Kumar.        
	The family, according to neighbours, has kept themselves locked in through most of yesterday and today, not responding to phone calls or the occasional doorbell.         
	Retired Flight Lieutenant S.S. Yadav, one of the few neighbours of Mola who agreed to speak, said he couldnt believe the nice young man could have done such a thing.        
	The family is well known and very well liked in the colony. There have been no complaints against Jitendra ever, said Yadav, also the vice-president of the colonys Residents Welfare Association.        
	Molas aunt initially refused to speak but later said: Its all a mistake. Someone just misunderstood him on that flight.... He is a normal guy with a calm head on his shoulders.        
	One of Molas friends who did not wish to be named said: We have been friends for a long time. Never have I seen any problem with him. Yes, he joked around but he was sensitive enough to understand where to draw the line.        
	Police officers, too, are foxed. He doesnt seem too perturbed. Even when in jail, he behaves as if it is a regular thing for him. He has shown no panic or remorse. Its as if he doesnt understand how a prank can get him into deep trouble, an officer said.        
	Psychiatrist Harish Shetty, however, said: He is definitely unstable. Its not a prank. A bomb scare can be called a prank when the prankster... knows he might get away with it. In this case, this was an attack by someone who is frustrated and needs to show off his aggression.

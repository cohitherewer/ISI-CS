The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Delhi stalls Bulldozer 
                                                                                                           Delhi stalls Bulldozer 
  - Kashmir out of US special envoys reach           K.P. NAYAR                            Holbrooke, Clinton                                        
	Washington, Jan. 23: In the scorched battles under way in Washington to sway the Obama administrations policies on everything from Afghanistan to Israel, India has won the first round.        
	Barack Obamas secretary of state Hillary Clinton strode into the US state department yesterday after her unexpectedly contentious Senate approval and immediately announced the appointment of Richard Holbrooke as Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan.        
	The appointment of Holbrooke, one of Americas top-most diplomats who has also variously worn the hats of magazine editor, author, professor, Peace Corps official, and investment banker, was long expected, but there has been an intense effort here after the terrorist attacks in Mumbai to name him either special envoy for India and Pakistan or special envoy for South Asia.        
	India quietly lobbied with the Obama transition team and with Hillary and Vice-President Joe Biden to ensure that the new administrations special envoy would have nothing to do with Kashmir  at least on paper and for now.        
	Holbrooke, whose vaulting ambition is the stuff of legends in this city, himself would have preferred the South Asia designation: it would have enabled him to typically insert himself into the Kashmir issue and seek the Nobel Prize in case he could claim to have solved India-Pakistan disputes.        
	Holbrooke desperately wanted Hillarys job. Apart from the need to accommodate Hillary, no drama Obama would have been wary of someone like Holbrooke heading the state department.         
	Holbrooke has the nickname the Bulldozer because of his reputation in getting quarrelling world leaders to negotiate. He has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize seven times and solving Kashmir would have probably earned him this long, unfulfilled ambition.        
	Because of this and his reputation as the Bulldozer, Pakistan had lobbied hard here to get Holbrooke named special envoy for South Asia.        
	Such a designation would have been a slap in the face of India, which has consistently maintained that under the Simla Agreement, disputes between India and Pakistan must be resolved bilaterally.        
	The success in influencing Holbrookes designation is an indication that despite the omission of New Delhi from the Obama administrations priorities announced on Tuesday, India has the clout in the new White House, state department and the US Congress to protect its key interests.        
	All the same, it will have to be wary of Holbrooke, who will not hesitate at the first opportunity to insert himself into Indo-Pakistan matters, if only for his own sake.        
	Underlining the US security interests at stake in Afghanistan and Pakistan, one of the first things Hillary did yesterday after taking charge at Foggy Bottom was to telephone Pakistans President Asif Ali Zardari.        
	Flanked by the new President and the Vice-President, Hillary said: Holbrooke will co-ordinate across the entire government an effort to achieve US strategic goals in the region. This effort will be closely co-ordinated, not only within the State Department and, of course, with USAID, but also with the defence department and under the co-ordination of the National Security Council.        
	She gave a peek into the new administrations South Asia regional strategy when she said that dealing with the situation in Afghanistan requires an integrated strategy that works with both Afghanistan and Pakistan as a whole, as well as engaging Nato and other key friends, allies, and those around the world who are interested in supporting these efforts.        
	In his inimitable style, Holbrooke indicated that much of what he will do in Islamabad will be done in secret and away from any publicity. In Pakistan the situation is infinitely complex, and I dont think I would advance our goals if I tried to discuss it today. I wish to get out to the region and report back to the secretary, the Vice-President and the President.        
	In an implicit challenge to Indian diplomacy in Afghanistan, Holbrooke said: I will say that in putting Afghanistan and Pakistan together under one envoy, we should underscore that we fully respect the fact that Pakistan has its own history, its own traditions, and it is far more than the turbulent, dangerous tribal areas on its western border. And we will respect that.

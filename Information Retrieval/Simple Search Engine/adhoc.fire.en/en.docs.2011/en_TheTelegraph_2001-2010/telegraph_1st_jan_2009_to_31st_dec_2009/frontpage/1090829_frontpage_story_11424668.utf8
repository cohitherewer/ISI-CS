          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 28: Seven of the eight marmosets stolen from Alipore Zoo on August 9 were recovered by a crime branch team of Durg in Chhattisgarh tonight.        
	One person has been arrested and is being questioned by Chhattisgarh police.         
	The newly elected director of Alipore Zoo, Raju Das, said: We have just received the news that seven out of the eight Common Marmosets stolen from Alipore zoo have been recovered from Raipur in Durg district of Chhattisgarh. The seven Common Marmosets have been handed over to the conservator of forests of Durg. It has been confirmed to us that these are the same marmosets that were stolen from Alipore Zoo. One marmoset is reported to have died.        
	The rare monkeys of Brazilian origin of the size of large rats are worth around Rs 1 lakh each in the illicit wildlife market.        
	Chief conservator of forests Atanu Raha said: It seems to be the handiwork of an organised gang and it involves a lot of money.        
	A team of the detective department, along with forest officials, is leaving for Chhattisgarh tomorrow.        
	We had alerted police in all states. Searches were being carried out at all the entry and exits points of these states. Our counterparts in Chhattisgarh have informed us that they have arrested somebody by the name of Rajesh Saintia in whose possession the marmosets were found, said an official of the detective department.

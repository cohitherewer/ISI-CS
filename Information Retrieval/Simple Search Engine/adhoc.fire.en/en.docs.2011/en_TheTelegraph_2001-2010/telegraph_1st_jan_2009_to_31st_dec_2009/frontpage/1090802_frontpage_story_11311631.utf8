	Aug. 1: A gang picked out three AC chair cars of a popular Janshatabdi Express bound for Howrah and robbed 200 passengers of laptops, mobile phones and jewellery, boarding and leaving the unguarded train with the ease usually seen in Wild West movies.        
	The heist on the Barbil-Howrah Janshatabdi Express, a favourite with those travelling between Calcutta and Jamshedpur, took place near Gidni in East Singhbhum in Jharkhand this evening.        
	According to some passengers, the robbers, three of whom have been arrested and some valuables recovered, said they were Maoists but police said the claim had not been verified till late tonight.         
	The police said some of the robbers had boarded a non-AC compartment in Jamshedpur. Then they pulled the chain to stop the train so that others could join them. After the dacoity, they again pulled the chain and got off near Gidni, said Pranab Kumar, senior security commissioner of the railway force in Kharagpur.        
	The first instance of chain-pulling should have alerted the train officials but passengers said there were no security personnel on the express.        
	Asked about the absence of security personnel, Kumar said: We are suffering from an acute shortage of manpower. That is why we are unable to provide security to all trains.         
	Sources said railway minister Mamata Banerjee, who has been announcing a slew of projects for Bengal, had been informed of the robbery.        
	According to passengers, the gang, armed with pipe-guns, revolvers and bhojalis, stepped into the three AC chair cars through the vestibule around 6.30pm. The gang members  the police put their number at four but some passengers said they counted 15  divided themselves into three groups, roughed up a few men and ordered the travellers to hand over valuables.        
	The dacoits in their thirties, spoke in Hindi, and Bengali. They landed blows on four passengers and ordered us to hand over our cash, jewellery, watches, laptops and mobile phones, said Manish Verma, a businessman from Howrah. Verma said the robbers took from him Rs 2,000, a laptop, gold chains and a mobile phone.        
	The passengers said the gang wrapped up the looting in 20 minutes. Amit Kedia, a businessman based in Howrah and returning from Jamshedpur, said: Talking to other passengers, we calculated that about Rs 20 lakh in cash and valuables were looted.         
	At Kharagpur, the next scheduled stop, the passengers got down and went to the railway police station to protest.         
	Three of the robbers were later arrested from a local train. The police said a fourth was absconding.

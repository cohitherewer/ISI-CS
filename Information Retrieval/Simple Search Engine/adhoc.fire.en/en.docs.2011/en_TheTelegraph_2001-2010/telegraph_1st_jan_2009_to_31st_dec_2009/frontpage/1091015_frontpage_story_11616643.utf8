	Oct. 14: Rahul Gandhi began his two-day trip to Jharkhand addressing youths in Sahebganj, Dumka and Hazaribagh, but saved his only message for the day for Ranchi where he warned squabbling partymen to end infighting and prepare for a war against bigger foes.        
	The state Congress, riddled with dissension, was eagerly waiting for the AICC general secretarys visit, primarily aimed at rejuvenating the party and overseeing the launch of a massive Youth Congress recruitment drive in Jharkhand before Assembly elections were announced.        
	There is nothing wrong with Congress ideology. But, yes, infighting in the party organisation does lead to erosion of mass support base, he told partymen at a conference hall in the MLAs Hostel in the state capital.        
	I sincerely advise you to stop fighting among yourselves and unitedly fight out the bigger foes.         
	He argued that a political party lost elections mainly due to three reasons  if its ideologies were wrong, its cadres were fighting among themselves and the party had drifted away from the masses. Therefore, it is high time for all Congress members to introspect.         
	Rahuls address, lasting barely five minutes, seemed to have had the desired effect with senior leaders agreeing that the message was loud and clear. Rahul Gandhi has correctly diagnosed the real problems being faced the party in Jharkhand, admitted senior Congress leader Aloke Dube.         
	On his plans to make the Youth Congress more effective, Rahul said the membership drive first began in Punjab where the number had gone up from 35,000 to 3.5 lakh.         
	In Jharkhand, too, the response is positive. It is your army. Now, it is your responsibility to strengthen it, he said.        
	Rahul started the day in Sahebganj were he interacted with tribal youth asking them to rise to the challenge of changing the fate of Jharkhand.        
	In India, there are two classes. Garib India (poor people) and amir India (rich people). We have to unite the two different communities by virtue of our effort, dedication and hard labour and then only can we dream of a great India, he told a gathering of around 400.        
	You should take it as a challenge and the party will always support you, he said.         
	In Dhanbad, he endeared himself to the students of Indian School of Mines University when he assured a delegation of 20 that he would take up their demand of getting IIT status for ISMU with the Union human resource development ministry.         
	Over 3,000 students who had gathered outside Penman Auditorium greeted the announcement with thunderous applause.        
	In Hazaribagh, Rahul interacted with tribal women and asked them not to take a backseat in politics, even as he clarified that the Congress would ensure the womens reservation bill was passed in Parliament.        
	When some women ward commissioners complained they were being sidelined and not allowed to function in the municipal board, he asked them to fight for their rights.        
	If you remain quiet and dont mount pressure, then things will remain the same. You will have to fight against all situations, he told them.        
	But strict security arrangements at the Town Hall, the venue of the meeting, meant that many had to be turned away.         
	I have served this party for more than 20 years and I came from Koderma, said Leelawatiu Devi in anger. But I was denied entry as I wasnt in that age group (18-35).        
	Among the senior leaders who accompanied Rahul today were Union minister for food processing Subodh Kant Sahay, Congresss Jharkhand in-charge K. Keshav Rao, state unit chief Pradeep Balmuchu, legislature party leader Manoj Kumar Yadav, National Youth Congress president Ashok Tanwar and party leader Jitendra Singh.

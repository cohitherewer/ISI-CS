The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Sir, spouse club calling
                                                                                                           Sir, spouse club calling
          JAYANTH JACOB                            Sudhakar and Nirupama Rao                          
	New Delhi, July 26: As Karnataka chief secretary, Sudhakar Rao devotes his days to every aspect of governance, from law and order to disaster relief. He could soon find himself also heading an erstwhile wives club in Delhi, planning charity sales and book club meetings.        
	If things go by the book, Rao should become president of the External Affairs Spouses Association early next month when his wife Nirupama Rao takes charge as foreign secretary.        
	The association used to be a sort of wives club from its inception in 1971 till March 2001 when Chokila Iyer became Indias first woman foreign secretary. With her husband Giri Iyer becoming the associations president, it was renamed from External Affairs Wives Association to External Affairs Spouses Association.        
	By then, Giri Iyer had retired from the Indian Audit and Accounts Service and could devote himself to the associations twice-a-month meetings and its social, cultural and humanitarian programmes. Sudhakar Rao, an IAS officer from the 1973 batch, will not get that kind of free time in his current post.        
	Association treasurer Neelam Prakash wasnt sure whether the state chief secretary would indeed take up the presidents post.        
	We havent come to know about the future arrangements yet. Giri Iyer, who was the first gentleman to become president of the association, was very active in the working of the association, Prakash said.        
	Another office-bearer said it made sense to have the foreign secretarys spouse as the president, as he or she would have the maximum influence among the members.        
	The association, whose members are the spouses of serving and retired gazetted officers in the Indian Foreign Service, usually holds two meetings every month. Almost all its office-bearers, and most of its about 400 members, are women.        
	The association provides financial and educational aid to poor students and with the help of Indian missions, holds bazaars abroad to raise funds for charity. It organises lectures  such as one on astrology last March  as well as heritage walks and cultural events.        
	Association rules say the foreign secretarys spouse shall be the president. In his or her absence, the vice-president shall officiate. Poonam Surie and Anuradha Ravi, wives of secretary (west) Nalin Surie and secretary (east) N. Ravi, are the current vice-presidents.        
	Among the other office-bearers are the secretary, co-secretary, treasurer, treasurer of the charitable trust, and chairperson of the magazine committee.

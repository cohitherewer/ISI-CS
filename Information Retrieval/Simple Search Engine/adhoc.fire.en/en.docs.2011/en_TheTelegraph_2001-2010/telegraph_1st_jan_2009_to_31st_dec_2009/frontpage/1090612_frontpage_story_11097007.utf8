The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Chiria to be SAILs pride, others envy
                                                                                                           Chiria to be SAILs pride, others envy
          AMIT GUPTA                              
	Ranchi, June 11: A day after Union steel minister Virbhadra Singh made it clear that the Centre would persuade the state to renew the Chiria mines lease in favour of Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) within 100 days, private players  ArcelorMittal, JSW Steel and JSPL  who had signed MoUs with the state for setting up industries have started frowning.        
	Singh had in New Delhi said that the state had almost accepted the ownership of SAIL over Chiria mines. Jharkhand has decided to change the ownership title of the Chiria iron ore reserve in SAILs favour, he was quoted as saying in news reports. The lease of Chiria was earlier held by Burnpur-based IISCO, which later merged with SAIL.         
	Senior JSW Steel officials in Ranchi said it would be an Herculean task for them to meet future requirements as the state had granted control of the two biggest iron ore reserves  Chiria and Ghatkuri (West Singhbhum)  to PSUs.         
	The decision will affect our prospects. If Chiria goes to SAIL, then the state should ensure that Ghatkuri goes to a PSU like National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC) that ultimately sells the ore to private players, said R.P. Singh, the chief executive officer of JSW Steel. He, however, maintained that captive mining was cheaper for companies when it came to overall production cost.        
	 JSW Steel has been allotted the Ankua mine reserve in West Singhbhum, where it recently carried out a public hearing for environmental clearance for 1,000 hectares. But authorities feel that given the proposed production capacity of over 10 MTPA, it will be impossible to meet the requirement from Ankua alone.         
	Global steel behemoth ArcelorMittal had also applied for a 1.25 square mile of Chiria when the state came out with a gazette notification amid talks of cancellation of lease to erstwhile IISCO. Chiria has very good and proven deposits. It would have been nice if we got a share. But the state it seems has decided to transfer the ownership in favour of SAIL, said an official of ArcelorMittal, requesting anonymity.        
	ArcelorMittal has been allotted a 65MT reserve in Karampada, in West Singhbhum. The state is in the process of granting an adjoining mine in favour of the company as a 65MT deposit is not enough to meet the companys future demands.         
	JSPL officials conceded that they had applied for Chiria and were yet to know the states stand officially.         
	State mines department sources said the paper work for the mutation (change of ownership) had already been done and the governor had also given his nod.         
	It will be a mutation and renewal per se. However, 75 per cent deadlock over SAILs ownership over Chiria has now ended. The states locus standi is now clear  it wants to give Chiria to SAIL, said R.N. Prasad, the deputy director of the mines department. SAIL, a state PSU, has plans to expand its production capacity beyond 26MTPA by 2011-12.        
	The steel major has 11 iron ore mining leases in the state including the merged subsidiary, IISCO (Burnpur). Out of these, two lease of Chiria (Ajitaburu and Sukrilatur) and one lease of Gua (Jhilingburu-I) are under litigation. The other leases, which are under deemed extension and awaiting renewal from the state, are lease-I, II and III of Kiriburu-Maghataburu, Budhaburu and Dhobil of Chiria and Jhilingburu and Topailor of Gua.

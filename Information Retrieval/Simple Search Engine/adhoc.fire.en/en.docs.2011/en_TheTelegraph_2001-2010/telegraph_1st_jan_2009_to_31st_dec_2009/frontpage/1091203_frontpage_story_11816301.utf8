                                Monroe smoking what appears to be marijuana in the video. (AP)                            
	London, Dec. 2: A home video of Marilyn Monroe allegedly smoking cannabis has been sold for 180,000.        
	The film was shot around 50 years ago at a private home in New Jersey but has only recently surfaced. Keya Morgan, who collects the Hollywood legends memorabilia, tracked down the footage.        
	This is the late Fifties so she is already very famous  but this is a personal side of her weve never seen before. People have never seen her in such a relaxed pose, said Morgan.         
	The video shows Monroe looking relaxed and laughing, before inhaling what appears to be a marijuana cigarette, sniffing her armpit and giggling. Morgan bought the reel-to-reel silent colour film from the man who filmed it.         
	That man has asked to remain anonymous. But the footage will be put up for sale again when it is auctioned off on eBay later this week.         
	The man who shot the film said that the cigarette contained marijuana, saying: I got it (the pot). It was mine. It was just passed around. It wasnt a party.

                                                                                                           Soren dumps Jamtara
          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                              
	Ranchi, May 30: Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) chief Shibu Soren has finally made his choice. Deciding to retain his Dumka Lok Sabha seat, he quit the Jamtara Assembly seat today.        
	With this, the effective strength of the Jharkhand Assembly has been reduced to 72.         
	But the JMMs hopes of forming an alternative government in the state still exist.        
	The formation of a JMM-led alternative government in the state is imminent. The party will decide the chief ministerial candidate. We are confident of proving our majority in the Assembly, said JMM central committee member Supriyo Bhattacharya.        
	After the Tamar debacle (when Soren lost the crucial bypoll that would give him a berth in the Assembly while chief minister), the JMM had suggested several chief ministerial candidates who had been turned down by the Congress and other alliance partners.         
	Assembly Speaker Alamgir Alam told The Telegraph over telephone today that he was in Delhi to congratulate his old friends who had been given berths in the Union cabinet, and not because the Congress was mulling his candidature for chief ministership as had been speculated. He will return to Ranchi tomorrow.        
	During my informal interactions with several senior leaders here, the Jharkhand issue did figure prominently. But the Centre is yet to decide whether the state Assembly should be dissolved or whether the formation of an alternative government should be explored, he added.        
	But former deputy chief minister and JMM leader Sudhir Mahto claimed that the power equations had changed and the Congress were once again looking at JMM to form an alternative government.         
	He, however, remained tightlipped over the chief ministerial candidate.

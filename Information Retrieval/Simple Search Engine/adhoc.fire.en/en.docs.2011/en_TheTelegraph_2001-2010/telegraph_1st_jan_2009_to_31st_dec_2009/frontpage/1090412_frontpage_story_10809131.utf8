	Ranchi, April 11: Five CRPF jawans were killed today by Maoist rebels in a meticulously executed ambush in Khunti about 40km from Kutcheri Ground where Congress president Sonia Gandhi addressed her first rally in Jharkhand.        
	The ambush, pulled off by CPI(Maoist) rebels on patrolling CRPF jawans, took place inside Jalko forests of Khunti district under the Arki police station around 4am.        
	It appears the rebels had already taken positions on the hills of the forests, said IG (provision) and state police spokesman S.N. Pradhan. While the jawans were passing through, they opened fire.        
	He said five CRPF jawans were killed and three others were injured. The injured, Jayram Ramdhi (35), Abhay Kumar Singh (30) and R.C. Das (30) have been brought to Apollo Hospital in Irba in Ranchi. They are all out of danger.        
	The dead have been identified as Hoshiyar Singh, Majhar Ali Khan, Sunil Rai, Sahadilip Singh and NN Sharma  all in their mid-30s. Their bodies were later brought to RIMS in Ranchi.        
	Pradhan said the CRPF men, who had information about rebels planning a strike in the forests, had been told to scour the area. The CRPF men had been assigned to cleanse the area of Maoists after this information came in.        
	Pradhan explained that it became difficult for the CRPF to engage the Naxalites in a counter-attack as they were atop the hill while the jawans were below. As Khunti superintendent of police Prabhat Kumar was tied up with security arrangements at the venue of Sonias rally, Ranchi SSP Praveen Kumar Singh rushed to the spot along with his men.        
	The policemen continued sanitisation operations in the Arki region well after the ambush got over and the rally at Kutcheri Ground had come to an end around 12.45pm.         
	We have recovered a large number of bullets and empty cartridges from the venue. We have also recovered the body of a Naxalite, Singh said over phone from Jalko and added that the CRPF men had killed another Naxalite too, but his body was yet to be located.

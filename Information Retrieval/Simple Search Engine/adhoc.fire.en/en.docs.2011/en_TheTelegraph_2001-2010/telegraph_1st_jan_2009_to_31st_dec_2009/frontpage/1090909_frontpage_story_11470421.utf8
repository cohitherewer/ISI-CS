  - Why Buddha skipped politburo          OUR BUREAU                            Karat, Bhattacharjee                                       
	Sept. 8: Politicians are not unknown to use an illness to send out a political message. It now looks certain that Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee did the same by staying away from last weeks meeting of the CPM politburo.         
	Officially, the party attributed his absence to his illness. Not that it isnt true  it is known that the chief minister has not been keeping well for some time. But what is now known but cannot be officially stated by the party is that Bhattacharjee chose not to attend the politburo meeting to send out a message to general secretary Prakash Karat.        
	It is not that the absence is a sign of the chief minister wanting to quit; it has more to do with the tension in his current relations with Karat.         
	That this was the case was confirmed in a way by his visit to Siliguri today to address a Left Front rally there as part of the partys campaign for the Siliguri municipal polls next week. Coming within a few days of the politburo meeting, Bhattacharjees Siliguri visit has exposed the holes in the partys official line that he couldnt make it to New Delhi because of his illness.         
	Party sources said that Karat made an attempt to dissuade Bhattacharjee from going to Siliguri as the visit would bring the questions about his absence from the politburo meeting out in the open. But the chief minister ignored the counsel, thereby further driving his point home to the party boss.         
	Bhattacharjee has been unhappy with the way Karat has continuously blamed the partys debacle in the Lok Sabha polls in Bengal on poor performance by the state government, especially in areas such as poverty alleviation schemes and health.        
	Recently, while disagreeing with Amartya Sen on his views on the Left, Karat had ended an article by endorsing the economists references to the Bengal government. He (Sen) was right in pointing out that the Left Front government of West Bengal needs to do more in the spheres of primary education, literacy and health, Karat had written.                                
	Although the CPM general secretary went on to say that at the national level, too, the Left needed to do much more, the public endorsement of the references to shortcomings of a government ruled by the party had raised eyebrows in the CPM. Some leaders also felt that the sustained criticism of Bengal was meant to deflect attention from the mistakes made by the central leadership.        
	The chief minister  and most other leaders in the Bengal unit of the party  on the other hand, think that Karats decision to sever links with the Congress and withdraw Left support to the UPA government led to the partys defeat by facilitating the alliance between the Congress and the Trinamul Congress.         
	True, the decision to withdraw support to the UPA government was taken unanimously at the central committee, said a senior party leader, but the timing of it was Karats decision. And we thought it was wrong and was the primary reason for our defeat.        
	That many leaders in Bengal endorsed Bhattacharjees argument was evident at the first meeting of the partys Bengal state committee after the polls. Sensing the mood of the Bengal comrades, Karat chose to stay away from it. In the CPMs scheme of things, it was unusual for the general secretary to skip such an important meeting.        
	Of course, there were some leaders in Bengal, particularly Nirupam Sen and Biman Bose, the other politburo members from Bengal, who supported the Karat line. But although he is seen as Bhattacharjees number two and his principal ally in the industrialisation campaign, Sen does not have the leadership profile of either Bhattacharjee or Bose and is not particularly popular with state-level leaders.        
	There have been problems in relations between the two, but not all of these relate to ideological issues. The Vedic Village episode and the Stop (Abdur Rezzak) Mollah campaign within the party seems to have now brought the two on the same side, despite persisting personal differences.         
	With Karat, however, its different for Bhattacharjee. According to a leader close to Bhattacharjee, Karat has not only been critical of the former on the poll reverses, he has also sought to use the politburo in his campaign. Buddhada cant be happy to see the PB used against him. We agree that there are problems with the way the government functions and we need to solve them. But Prakash Karat seems to be bent on fixing the blame on him (the chief minister), he said.         
	Bhattacharjee will attend the next politburo meeting, scheduled on October 10, and the central committee meeting thereafter. But, by staying away from the last meeting, he wanted the politburo to know that he was peeved with Karats ways.

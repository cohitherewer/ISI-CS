          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                              
	New Delhi, May 28: The Congress has skimmed off the cream of the infrastructure and social sector portfolios and while ceding some important ministries to ally DMK, has attached to them its own junior ministers.        
	It has also put Rahul Gandhis nominees in the rural development ministry, which implements the UPAs flagship aam aadmi project, the job guarantee scheme.        
	The party held its own at the end of serial meetings over seven days between Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh despite the DMK and the Nationalist Congress Party pressing for larger shares of the economic pie.        
	The Congress claimed road transport and highways as well as shipping from the DMK, retained power, petroleum and natural gas, steel, heavy industries and public enterprises, commerce and industry, and food processing. It yielded textiles, communications and IT, and chemicals and fertilisers to its Tamil Nadu ally.        
	As the portfolios for 72 ministers were announced late in the night, it was evident that those that impinged more directly on the lives of disadvantaged people had been allocated with Rahul in mind.        
	The Amethi MP has often indicated that rural infrastructure, health and education are his top priorities. C.P. Joshi, the debutant Rajasthan MP whose induction had surprised many in the party, has been put in charge of rural development and panchayati raj.        
	The previous rural development minister, Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, had transformed the ministry, once known mostly for its dull documentaries, into one that provided a lifeline to the rural poor through the job guarantee scheme.        
	The Congress, however, had been upset that a project conceived by Sonia and her erstwhile National Advisory Council team had virtually been usurped by the RJD to which Raghuvansh belonged. Even the Left kept claiming credit for the scheme.        
	This time the Congress was determined to get the ministry. There was a tug-of-war among the big names, such as Kamal Nath and M. Veerappa Moily, but eventually the portfolio went to Joshi who had apparently impressed Rahul with his knowledge and understanding of the rural job programme.        
	That one of the three ministers of state attached to Joshi is Pradeep Jain underscores how important the ministry is to Rahul. Jain is apparently the only candidate Rahul had directly recommended because of his commitment to farmers in drought-stricken Bundelkhand, among the first issues Rahul had chosen while taking on Mayavati.        
	Kapil Sibal has got human resource development because, sources said, the Prime Minister, Sonia and Rahul felt he was the right candidate to pull the ministry out of the controversies Arjun Singh had enmeshed it in.        
	Sibal has a contemporary and futuristic vision of education that is rooted in ground realities , a source said.        
	Sibal, science and technology minister in the previous government, had spiritedly defended the Indo-US nuclear deal, on which Manmohan had staked his prestige, at a time many Congress leaders had been tentative about it.        
	Kumari Selja stays housing and poverty alleviation minister. Sources said Sonia had insisted she should be promoted to a cabinet post. The government is expected to unveil big schemes for affordable urban housing.        
	The Prime Minister and Sonia have also ensured the allies would not have free run of the infrastructure ministries.        
	So the DMKs Dayanidhi Maran, A. Raja and M.K. Azhagiri have the Congresss Panabaka Lakshmi, Gurudas Kamat, Sachin Pilot and Srikant Jena as juniors.        
	Congress cabinet ministers with infrastructure portfolios too have got deputies from their own party: Vilasrao Deshmukh (heavy industries and public enterprises), Sushil Kumar Shinde (power) and Nath (road transport and highways) will work with Pratik Patil, Bharatsinh Solanki, Mahadev Khandela and R.P.N. Singh.

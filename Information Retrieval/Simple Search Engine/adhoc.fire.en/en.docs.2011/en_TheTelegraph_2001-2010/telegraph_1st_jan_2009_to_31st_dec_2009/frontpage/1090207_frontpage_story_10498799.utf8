                                                                                                           Ulfa peaceniks spill beans 
  - Pro-talks group confirms outfits links with ISI amp; Bangla          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                                          
	New Delhi, Feb. 6: Ulfas pro-peace leaders today spilled the beans on chief whip Paresh Baruas links with Pakistans Inter Services Intelligence (ISI), training camps in Bangladesh and the outfits relationship with the state Congress and the AGP.        
	Mrinal Hazarika, the lieutenant heading the ceasefire-bound companies of Ulfas 28th battalion, today told reporters in New Delhi about his outfits training in Bangladesh, beginning with his own.        
	He described how he was trained in the neighbouring country and said until two years ago Ulfa sent its men to the Pakistan-Afghan border to train with help from the ISI.        
	Post 9/11, Hazarika said, in a bipolar world of Christians and Islamics, Ulfa had decided to go with the latter and has paid dearly, as no one listens to them at international fora.        
	Along with deputy Probal Neog, Hazarika is in Delhi to explore ways to negotiate with the Centre the possibility of turning Assam into a completely autonomous council.         
	They have spoken to chief minister Tarun Gogoi to facilitate the talks with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.         
	The top Ulfa leadership has close links with the ISI, Directorate General of Field Intelligence (the Bangladeshi intelligence agency) and some Islamic organisations. Without their support, it is not possible for anyone to have bases in Bangladesh, Hazarika said.         
	Ulfa has several camps, offices and shelter places in Bangladesh, including a few in the cities, he added.        
	All these have been running with the consent of the official agencies of that country.        
	Barua and Arabinda Rajkhowa, along with Anup Chetia, are still in Bangladesh and have been sucked deep into the ISIs network, prompting them to not only deny their role in the October 30 serial blasts but also deny the role of Islamic outfits from Bangladesh.         
	What was the need to deny the Islamic outfits role? They have not come to Assam since the nineties and are currently hiring young people to trigger blasts, Hazarika told The Telegraph.         
	Hazarika also did not deny links between Ulfa and leaders of the Congress and the AGP at different points of time.         
	Without Ulfa, it was not possible for political parties to survive in Assam, he said.         
	Hazarika also spoke about Ulfas relationship with the Peoples Liberation Army and the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Khaplang) group.         
	Neog went on to relate stories in perfectly accented Nagamese about the years spent in the company of NSCN (K) leader S.S. Khaplang, in Myanmar.         
	Outlining the groups demands, Hazarika said they wanted autonomy for Assam in which an Upper House would grant equal representation to all indigenous people.         
	The leadership, he said, had erred in declining Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs proposal to discuss all core issues in 2007.         
	It is because of unequal representation under the Indian Constitution that the Misings, Bodos or Karbis were all asking for either separate federal entities or complete independence. What if the government does not agree? Then we will be back to our struggle, another Ulfa leader, Jiten Dutta, said.         
	Dutta was not present for the interaction.        
	Hazarikas comments came at a time when Pakistan was oscillating between outright denial and sheepish acceptance of its involvement in the Mumbai attacks on November 26 last year and India was awaiting its investigation report.         
	But Ulfa is not the only group which has sent men to the badlands in Afghanistan for training. Vikiye Sema, an NSCN (I-M) activist in 1994-95, had once claimed of undergoing training in the Tora-Bora mountains and related his experiences with men, he thought, belonged to al-Qaida.         
	Sema along with another rebel first went to Bangladesh and flew to Karachi on Bangladeshi passports more than a decade ago. He had said they were taken to Peshawar by their contacts before being respectfully escorted to Afghanistan to undergo a three-month course.

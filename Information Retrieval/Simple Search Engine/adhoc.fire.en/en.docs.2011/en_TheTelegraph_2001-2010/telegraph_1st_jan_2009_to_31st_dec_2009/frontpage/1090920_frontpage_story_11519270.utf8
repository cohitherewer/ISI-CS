  - Tharoor may save job with leash on twittering          MANINI CHATTERJEE                                                    
	New Delhi, Sept. 19: Shashi Tharoor, who returns to the capital from his African sojourn on Monday, may retain his day job as minister of state for external affairs for the time being but will have to give up his 24/7 vocation as unofficial ambassador of twitter.com, well-placed sources indicated today.        
	He will also be advised not to shoot off his mouth every time a television microphone is thrust towards him.        
	Under sustained fire from Congress spokespersons for his tweet on travelling cattle class in solidarity with holy cows, Tharoor received something of a reprieve last evening after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh sought to downplay the controversy as a trifling matter. The Prime Ministers exact response to a question from some reporters at his Iftar was: Nok jhok toh hotee rahtee hai (such sparring/banter happens).        
	But even that throwaway line came as a great relief for Tharoor, especially after Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot had publicly called for his resignation and Congress spokesman Manish Tiwari made it clear that the party was in no mood to accept Tharoors half-hearted apology (again, in the form of a tweet) at face value.        
	The Prime Ministers remark was an attempt to put a lid on the controversy but only after Tharoor got the message loud and clear that it would not be business as usual once he returns to South Block next week. Like an errant schoolboy, he has been let off with a severe public reprimand from his party but the school principal has decided to keep him on the rolls provided he does not transgress the rules again, sources said.        
	These unstated rules are not confined to his twittering tendencies alone. The Congress may be up in arms over his latest holy cows tweet, which many see as an outrageous dig at Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi (since Sonia travelled by economy class and Rahul by Shatabdi chair car just days before).        
	But many Congress old-timers are also jealous of Tharoors quick rise in the party and government  getting a prestigious Lok Sabha ticket out of turn and then getting a high-profile portfolio despite being a first-time MP.        
	But Tharoors problem is that even his erstwhile backers are more than a little disappointed with his lack of gravitas which they did not expect of a gentleman of his avowed erudition and experience in international diplomacy.        
	According to sources, much before he fell foul of the party for staying in a five-star hotel (because he needed a gym and privacy) and then twittering about the austerity drive, his bosses in South Block had begun to harbour misgivings about his suitability for the job that was given to him.        
	Two instances stand out. In an interview to a TV channel on July 1, Tharoor described the decision of China to block the $60 billion Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan for a project in Arunachal Pradesh as outrageous. That wasnt a word the mandarins in the MEA would ever use and a lot of back-channel diplomacy had to be employed to soothe Chinese nerves.        
	South Block insiders point out that it isnt as if India has not protested Chinas move at the ADB but a Union minister has to choose his words a lot more carefully. Replying to questions in the Rajya Sabha a few days later, external affairs minister S.M. Krishna did just that. India had conveyed to all ADB member nations, including China, that Arunachal Pradesh is an integral part of India and its status is not negotiable, he said.        
	Similarly, Tharoors comment to TV reporters outside Parliament that the India-Pakistan joint statement released after a meeting of the two Prime Ministers at Sharm-el Sheikh was not a legal paper also went down badly at a time the Prime Minister was under fire from all sides for signing that statement.        
	Tharoors intention was to deflect the flak and he said: It is a diplomatic paper that is released to the press  different from legal papers. Ultimately, what matters is not the perception of words on paper, it is the conduct of government. But it ended up sounding like a devaluation of the Prime Ministers initiative in Egypt.        
	At the same time, even his detractors concede that Tharoors experience and learning make him a valuable asset, if only he had not succumbed to the insidious charms of celebrity-hood that the world of television and twitterdom provide.        
	The unkindest cut, though, come from his fellow Stephanians both in and outside the government who feel that Tharoor  like many NRIs caught in a time warp  has not really outgrown the St Stephens brand of humour that is entirely inappropriate in the world of realpolitik.        
	For all his Wodehousian wit, they feel, Tharoor has lately resembled a bumbling Bertie Wooster than a cerebral Jeeves. His friends hope he will realise that stiff upper-lipped silence is often a better virtue to negotiate the slippery slopes of Raisina Hill.

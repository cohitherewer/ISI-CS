The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Federer Fifteen in fitting finale 
                                                                                                           Federer Fifteen in fitting finale 
                                Roger Federer kisses the trophy on Centre Court at Wimbledon. It was the longest mens Grand Slam final in history at 77 games  breaking the previous record of 71 from 1927 in Australia. (Reuters picture)                          
	July 5: Pete Sampras, Rod Laver and Bjorn Borg sat in the Royal Box and watched. Roger Federer stood alone, on centre stage.        
	A heart-stopping 5-7, 7-6, 7-6, 3-6, 16-14 Wimbledon victory over American Andy Roddick, and the Swiss had become the first man to win 15 Grand Slams, his claim to being the greatest now propped as much by arithmetic as by the art from his racket.        
	The big moment was set up beautifully  coming at the end of the longest Grand Slam final and the longest fifth set  for which Federer must thank his opponent, who played out of his skin only to fall short at the death.        
	Few could have imagined todays match coming anywhere close to last years epic when Federer lost to Rafael Nadal in near-darkness and broke down in tears.        
	Nadals absence this year had robbed the field of palpable charisma at the outset, but the exceptional play of Federer, Roddick, Briton Andy Murray and Australian Lleyton Hewitt more than compensated.        
	The final was decided by razor-thin differences in talent, fortitude and luck. It was marked by sportsmanship, with neither player uttering a word in anger or feigning injury to wangle a momentary time-out.        
	Andy I want to say youre going to come back and win one, Im sure, Federer said on court to a shattered Roddick.                  Pete Sampras watches the match. (Reuters)      
	The American had said that after losing the 2004 final to Federer, he threw the kitchen sink. This was the sink, the bathtub, even the shower everything.        
	Today I was on the lucky side. It was a crazy match, my heads still spinning, Federer said.        
	The outcome may yet not fully settle who is the greatest of all time  tennis historians say there are simply too many variables, such as the evolution of the rackets shape and composition and the revolution in string technology.        
	What is undisputed is that this was the longest mens Grand Slam final in history at 77 games, though a few minutes shorter than last years. Why dont they just agree to share it? someone asked as Federer and Roddick went toe-to-toe at 14-all in the final set.        
	But suddenly it was all over. Federer jumped, punched the air and whacked the net. Roddick tossed his racket away and the two men hugged. Federer held up the trophy and kissed it.        
	Man, its been quite a career and quite a month, said Federer, who also reclaims the No. 1 ranking from Nadal. But this is not why Im playing tennis, to break all sorts of different records. But its definitely one of the greatest ones to have.        
	Turning to Sampras, Federer said: Thanks very much for coming. I know its a long way (from America), but youre a member, man, we like to see you here. Its such a pleasure to play in front of such greats legends.        
	Roddick said: Sorry Pete, I tried to hold him off.                    WRITTEN WITH AGENCY AND LAT-WP REPORTS

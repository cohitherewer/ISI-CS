          SANTOSH K. KIRO                              
	Ranchi, Aug. 12: In tune with the urgency set in motion by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to tackle the spiralling effects of drought, the Jharkhand administration today formed a task force of state officials and bankers to ensure payments for social security schemes  like NREGA  werent delayed.        
	To be headed by development commissioner, the task force would have as members representatives of Nabard, State Bank of India, Allahabad Bank and Bank of India, apart from secretaries of various departments, including rural development, disaster management, institutional finance and agriculture.        
	The task force, formed at a meeting held today on the orders of Governor K. Sankaranarayanan, will be meeting at least once in a week to review ground realities and monitor levels of cash and credit flow among the rural poor.        
	The state administration asked banks to ensure that local branch managers did not hold up payments to beneficiaries of social security schemes such as NREGA and old age pensions.         
	Though the money for social security schemes gets credited in the personal accounts of villagers, they get the cash from banks only after several days. This is happening in NREGA and the old-age pension scheme, said S.K. Choudhary, the development commissioner.         
	He said the state had recently distributed Rs 200 crore under old-age pension scheme. But, several deputy commissioners arent sure when the cash would actually reach the beneficiaries even though the money had been credited to their accounts, he added.         
	The state government also asked banks to give consumption loans of Rs 10,000 each to families that were poor but not categorised as BPL. Unlike BPL families, these families werent entitled to free foodgrain.        
	As this category of families would also be effected by drought, they have to be supported by consumption loans, Choudhary said.         
	Union minister of food processing Subodh Kant Sahay, who was present at todays meeting, asked bankers to ensure village branch managers followed instructions of senior officials to ensure cash flow and timely disbursal of credit.         
	Sahay feared that if the state failed to deal with drought effectively, left wing extremists would use it as another tool to capitalise on the frustrations of villagers.         
	The state is already Naxalite infested. And if the drought is not managed properly, the rank and file of villagers would join them, he feared.        
	He said banks had to play a pro-active role to ensure villagers were able to buy foodgrain. There will be plenty (of foodgrain) in markets even during drought. But, famines occur when the purchasing power of people gets weak, he said.

                                                                                                           Start state work: Morcha to govt
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Darjeeling, Sept. 6: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha today said the state and the Centre should get down to work instead of sweet talking and announced a slew of agitation programmes to keep up the pressure of conferring statehood on the Darjeeling hills.         
	Rallies, demonstrations, wearing of traditional dresses and the resignation of chairpersons and vice-chairpersons from the boards of administration of the hill municipalities will be part of the fresh agitation that will extend over three months. However, the party refrained from calling any strikes that could hamper business during the tourism season that is set to start within a fortnight.         
	It is time for the state and the Centre to act instead of indulging in sweet talking. Dissolve the DGHC as promised and dump the Sixth Schedule bill officially. We want to see these things done, thundered party president Bimal Gurung at a public meeting at the Motor Stand here.         
	Political observers believe that the Morcha does not want another round of talks without anything to show to its supporters.         
	The Morcha, state and the Centre had agreed to dissolve the DGHC, scrap the Sixth Schedule bill and appoint an interlocutor during the last tripartite meeting held in New Delhi on August 11. During his visit to the hills a week ago, home secretary Ardhendu Sen had said an arrangement to replace the DGHC would be made as soon as proposals came from the Morcha. The process to repeal the act will begin then, he had said.         
	In an obvious pressure tactics, Gurung said unless the governments acted, the party would not feel nice about attending the fourth round of talks in Darjeeling on December 21. I have, however, kept in mind the Centres request (to maintain peace) while announcing the agitation.         
	This time, the agitation is largely centred on dissolving the DGHC. From tomorrow, employees associated with the Janmukti Karmachari Sangatan will wear black armbands to support the contractual workers (who number around 7,000) of the DGHC in their demand for regularisation of jobs. On the cultural movement, Gurung said: No one should be forced to wear traditional dresses. However, I will construe that those who dont (wear) are against Gorkhaland.         
	Gurung was also unhappy with the state governments decision to open an additional Regional Transport Authority counter in Siliguri. He dared the state to transfer all government offices (from Darjeeling to Siliguri).        
	On allegations levelled against the Gorkhaland Personnel for indulging in moral policing, Gurung said: One or two mistakes might have been committed But I have reports that the particular couple hauled up on Wednesday were found in an unacceptable position.         
	The GLP highhandedness on Wednesday had met with protests from the local people  the first against the uniformed brigade of the Morcha. It was good to see the GLP slink away, a witness had said.

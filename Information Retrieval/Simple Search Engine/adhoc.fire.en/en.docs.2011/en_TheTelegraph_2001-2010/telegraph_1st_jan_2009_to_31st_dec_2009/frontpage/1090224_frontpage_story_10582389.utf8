          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Sen at the lecture. Bishwarup Dutta                          
	Calcutta, Feb. 23: Amartya Sen today chided the Left for making too big a deal of the nuclear deal.        
	The pact with the US, the Nobel laureate said, was not a great deal but was not a terrible deal either, and so should not have been reason enough to withdraw support and create a situation where the UPA government could fall.        
	 The job of the Left parties is to spend much more time on hunger, lack of education and deprivation of women, Sen said.        
	Speaking at the Pratichi Public Lecture at Rabindra Sadan, Sen iterated that politics in Bengal must focus on bringing about all-round development of the state.        
	He urged all parties to rise above partisan politics on the issue of industrial development. There will be differences among political parties. Without such differences, democracy will not work. But if the Opposition hurts the common peoples interest, it is not a desirable situation, Sen said.        
	He rued that Bengal was again acquiring a bad reputation on the industrial front, a blight from the past when activism by unions had driven industry away. This would make it difficult for the state to attract investment, he warned.        
	I dont see Bengals future at all bright without industry, he said.        
	Underlining the need for a collaborative approach to sustainable economic development, Sen asked the ruling party to take a more consultative approach and the Opposition to renounce the path of disruptive politics, such as calling bandhs.        
	 Bandh is a threat. You do not need the support of a majority to call a bandh. But it curtails freedom of the common man, he said.

	New Delhi, Oct. 15: India and the US are planning to create a joint panel of academicians and industry representatives to catalyse collaboration in education as New Delhi prepares to welcome American universities.         
	US undersecretary of state William Burns today met human resource development minister Kapil Sibal to discuss the proposed panel that may be formally unveiled during Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs Washington visit next month. Singhs trip will be the first state visit by a foreign dignitary to the US since Barack Obama moved into the White House.         
	Collaboration in education is expected to be a significant component of the discussions between the two delegations during the Prime Ministers visit.         
	Sibal is scheduled to go to the US in early November to meet senators and academicians who may be invited to the proposed India-US Education Council. The minister is also expected to try and convince foreign universities that the Indian government will not interfere in their growth prospects.         
	A government statement said Burns told Sibal that many American universities were interested in Indias future plans for its expanding higher education market  a reference to the proposed law allowing entry of foreign varsities.         
	Burns met external affairs minister S.M. Krishna, foreign secretary Nirupama Rao and will meet national security adviser M.K. Narayanan tomorrow in connection with Singhs visit. The leaders are also expected to discuss their concerns over terrorism, especially last weeks attack outside its embassy in Kabul, with Burns.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | HC rap on midday meals
                                                                                                           HC rap on midday meals
          CHANDRAJIT MUKHERJEE                              
	Ranchi, Aug. 21: Jharkhand High Court today pulled up the state administration for the near-collapse of the midday meal scheme and asked it not to absolve itself of overall responsibility by merely punishing lower-rung officials.        
	Pointing to the high frequency of children falling sick or dying after eating contaminated food, by taking suo motu notice of yesterdays incident in Seraikela where 48 students fell ill after a lizard was found in their meal, the court summoned advocate-general P.K. Prasad and asked him to ensure strict action against those responsible.        
	A division bench of Justice M.Y. Eqbal and Justice D.K. Sinha directed the Seraikela deputy commissioner to hold accountable those who were in charge of ensuring hygienic food was served to students of Urguttu Primary School in Rajnagar block. The court directed the Seraikela deputy commissioner to file an affidavit to explain what happened.        
	The court also observed that government schools were working amid pathetic conditions and there was no separate building for cooking and storing foodstuff. The court also noted the frequency of such incidents and pointed to the tragedy in March when five students a Bero school died after drinking poisonous milk served in school.        
	Each time such an incident happened, the administration suspended the principal of the school and the cook and the matter was laid to rest, the court observed. Justice Eqbal asked why no official of the HRD department or deputy commissioners had been suspended whenever such incidents were reported.         
	At the Urguttu Primary School, five-year-old Tara Gope found a dead lizard in her meal. Soon, many students started vomiting and were rushed to a primary health centre. Three are said to be serious.        
	The Seraikela deputy commissioner ordered a probe and suspended the principal and sevika of Mata Samiti, the organisation in-charge of cooking the meals.

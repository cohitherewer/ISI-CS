The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Agatha to be minister of state
                                                                                                           Agatha to be minister of state
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Shillong, May 23: The Northeast is likely to get another representation in the UPA government with NCP MP Agatha Sangma tipped to be inducted as a minister of state on Tuesday.        
	Agatha confirmed the development, saying she was told about Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs decision after Sharad Pawar sealed the deal for her.        
	 Agatha told The Telegraph over phone from Delhi today that it was the party presidents wish to see her inducted as a minister of state.         
	I am the only party MP from the region and the NCP needs representation from the Northeast. Hence my name was proposed, Agatha said, adding that Maharashtra would have two representatives, Pawar and Praful Patel.         
	Agatha is likely to get the portfolio of DoNER ministry, once held by the former Congress MP from Shillong, P.R. Kyndiah.        
	The Tura MP, however, said irrespective of the portfolio, she would do her best to serve the interests of the region.        
	Agathas brother and NCP legislator in Meghalaya, Conrad Sangma, said the party leader has told him that both Agatha and Patel would be inducted into the ministry on Tuesday.         
	Congress MP from Jorhat Bijoy Krishna Handique, sworn in on Friday, is the only MP from the Northeast to have taken oath of office till now.        
	Conrad said while one cabinet berth was given to Pawar, Patel would be made a minister of state with Independent charge.         
	Ever since the election results were declared, Agatha and her father P.A. Sangma have been camping in Delhi.         
	Sangma has been pressuring the NCP central leadership to accommodate his daughter into the ministry as she is the lone NCP MP from the east.        
	Agathas induction is one way of checking the growth of the Congress in the Garo Hills. Her victory margin this time was quite meagre.        
	The 28-year-old Agatha first contested a byelection from Tura last year after her father Sangma returned to state politics.        
	Since the NCP could not form a coalition government with the Congress in the state even with the best efforts of Sangma, the ministry berth to Agatha will bring joy to the state, Sangma had argued.

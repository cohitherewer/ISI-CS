  - Siloni, Indias first gibbon released in forest, dies young           OUR BUREAU                            Siloni, the female hoolock gibbon, at the Panbari reserve forest. File picture                                        
	Jan. 13: Siloni found freedom and love in the wild but lost her life at the dawn of her youth.        
	Indias first gibbon released into the wild died on Monday in Assams Panbari reserve forest near Kaziranga in a setback to conservation efforts aimed at pairing primates rendered mateless by forest destruction.        
	Forest officials and wildlife scientists had introduced the captive-reared hoolock gibbon, named Siloni after the place from which she was rescued, into the Panbari reserve forest, about 120km from Guwahati, in May last year in an attempt to unite her with a single wild male living there.        
	During her nine months of freedom, Siloni had explored the forest and mated with the male, but a wildlife attendant tasked with monitoring her daily found her lying dead near the base of a tree on Monday morning.        
	She was a little over six years old, a few months past sexual maturity and in the spring of her life. Hoolock gibbons have an average life expectancy of 25 years.        
	Meningitis could be the cause of the death, Prasanta Boro, a veterinarian at the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC) at Kaziranga, said after a post-mortem was conducted at the College of Veterinary Sciences in Guwahati.        
	This was our first attempt at experimental pairing of gibbons, said N.V.K. Ashraf, the director of rehabilitation at the Wildlife Trust of India, a non-government agency that has been tracking the return of Siloni into the wild.        
	The hoolock gibbon is an endangered species. Forest fragmentation has isolated gibbon populations, reducing the numbers in each forest fragment. Some fragments  like the one in Panbari where Siloni was introduced  have solitary gibbons.        
	Siloni was a year old when she was bought from a temple priest in Golaghat district in 2003. She was reared in captivity at the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation, a joint initiative of the Assam Forest Department and the Wildlife Trust of India.        
	Lakhiram visits the forest every morning to watch Siloni. Yesterday, he was surprised when he heard the shrill cries of Silonis mate. Finally, Lakhiram found Silonis carcass under a tree, Boro said.        
	The Kaziranga director, S.N. Buragohain, who had rescued the gibbon from Silonijan in Golaghat district, said Siloni was the first captive hoolock gibbon to have been released in the wild as an experiment on May 25 last year. We need to understand what went wrong and take corrective steps  if needed.        
	Siloni was found chained in a temple at Silonijan in 2002. The Kaziranga director had purchased the animal for Rs 500 and raised her in his official quarters.         
	She watched TV with me often and had also developed a habit of leafing through books and magazines. She became my constant companion since I stayed alone. She had shown signs of intelligence and had almost learned to feed with a spoon, Buragohain said.        
	After keeping her for over a year, Buragohain handed the animal to the Kaziranga authorities. Siloni was then raised at the CWRC near Kaziranga, where she was taught to live in the wild.        
	She learnt the ways of the wild very quickly. She was kept in a big enclosure which was camouflaged to resemble a forest. The enclosure was shifted to the Panbari reserve forest in 2007 and was kept under constant observation, Boro of the CWRC said.         
	After she was released in the wild, she found her mate very quickly and they made Panbari their home, he added.        
	The union of Siloni with her new mate was a major achievement in the strategy for management of single gibbons living without mates in Assam, the Kaziranga director said.         
	In the past, gibbon species have been successfully introduced into the wild in Indonesia and Thailand, Ashraf said. Apart from India, hoolock gibbons are found in Bangladesh, Myanmar and parts of Southeast Asia.        
	Conservationist Anwaruddin Choudhury, who was also involved in the rehabilitation process, said the idea behind releasing the gibbon in the wild was to learn more about the endangered species.         
	She was probably the first of her kind in the world to have been released in the wild after being raised in captivity for study purposes, he said.

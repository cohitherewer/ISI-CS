                                Azharuddin: Cong buzz                            
	New Delhi, Jan. 20 (PTI): Mohammad Azharuddins name was today doing the rounds as a possible Congress candidate for the Lok Sabha elections but the former Indian cricket captain made it clear he had no immediate plans to join politics.        
	As TV channels flashed the news of his possible entry into politics, Azhar expressed surprise at the speculation.         
	As of now, I dont know from where this story has come. If I join Congress, you will come to know that, he said.        
	The reports, quoting sources, claimed that Azhar had recently met Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and expressed his wish to contest the Lok Sabha polls.        
	Azhars meeting with Telengana Rashtra Samiti president K. Chandrasekhar Rao in February last year had sparked similar speculation about the possibility of his joining the TRS.        
	A veteran of 99 Tests, Azhar scored 6,215 runs at an average of 45.03. He also played 334 ODIs and scored 9,378 runs at an average of 36.92. He was banned in 2000 for his alleged involvement in the match-fixing scandal that rocked world cricket.        
	Along with wife Sangeeta Bijlani, Azhar runs an event management company and has set up a health club in Hyderabads Banjara Hills area.

          CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE                            Bula Hore with daughter Meghbarna after returning to Howrah. (Pradip Sanyal)                                  
	Calcutta, Feb. 14: As the train shuddered to a halt, Ramesh Mondal jumped out.        
	In the darkness ahead, he saw bogies scattered on the tracks like matchboxes. It was only then that the Rubber Board employee found out what had happened.        
	Hundreds of miles away in Barasat, Mousumi Roy, too, came to know about the late-evening accident around the same time Ramesh realised how close he had come to death.        
	Her son Subhankar, who was on the Howrah-Chennai Coromandel Express, had called her from his mobile phone to say he was safe. Still, Mousumi was at Howrah station early this morning. She wanted to be sure.        
	With her was Sameer Das, father of Subhankars friend Soumajit who also was on the train that derailed near Jajpur Road station in Orissa.        
	The first train that arrived from the accident spot was a relief special that lumbered in around 10.22 this morning. Five passengers, unscathed but shaken, stumbled out. We are all right. We are safe, said Sudhir Chandra Saha.        
	Saha and his wife Purnima, who were in coach HA-1 of the Coromandel Express, were headed for Bangalore.        
	The other passengers included Rubber Board employees Ratan Sarkar and Ramesh. We felt a series of jerks. After the train stopped, we got out and saw bogies scattered on the tracks like matchboxes, Ramesh said.        
	Some two-and-a-half hours after a medical team had checked the five passengers, a second train arrived with 42 passengers of the derailed express. Twenty-three had minor cuts and bruises.        
	Bula Hore, on her way to Salem with her husband, emerged comforting her wailing one-year-old daughter Meghbarna. Around 7.45, the train suddenly started lurching from one side to another. Some of our co-passengers broke a window and pulled us out, Bula said.        
	A special train carrying the bodies of two victims, Pawan Pillai and Lakshminarayan Manna, and 18 injured passengers arrived tonight at Howrah station.        
	Engineering student Nikhil Dalmia, who was in coach S-2, said he heard a strange noise. Then the compartment tilted. Some of us broke a window and climbed out, the 20-year-old recalled.        
	Subhankar and Soumajit, engineering students in Salem, still looked dazed. Our compartment lurched from side to side and then tilted, Subhankar said. His relieved mother couldnt stop crying.        
	But Preetam Gangulys wait isnt over yet. The Burdwan resident had last heard about his niece Suparna Ray from a friend around 11 last night. All he knew was that she was badly injured.        
	But Suparna wasnt on any of the trains that arrived today from the accident spot. Her cellphone is not reachable and her name is not on the list of injured, Preetam mumbled. I dont know what to do.

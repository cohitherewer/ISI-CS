	Jamshedpur, Sept. 30: Days before its national bandh, unarmed CPI(Maoist) rebels posing as villagers abducted a police intelligence official from a market, barely 500 metres from Arki in Khunti district today.        
	An inspector with the special branch, Francis Indwar was on duty at Hembram market when the rebels first surrounded him before dragging him away in full view of the public.        
	The Khunti superintendent of police, Jatin Marwal, who confirmed the incident, said six rebels, some of them posing as villagers, were involved in the operation. While the inspector was moving about in the Hembram market, the rebels apparently surrounded him and then started beating him up.        
	Subsequently, they took him away.         
	We gathered from eyewitnesses that the rebels, who were carrying no weapons, surrounded him instantaneously. They then caught hold of him and dragged him away from the market place, Marwal said.        
	Located along Kharkari river, the Arki police station area is considered to be a Maoist-stronghold. About 100km from Ranchi and 85km from Jamshedpur, the area is said to be under the operational command of the dreaded Naxalite leader, Kundan Pahan.        
	The SP said the abduction was carried out around 4.30pm and the police swung into action soon after getting the information. The police, along with intelligence officials, began a search across Arki, but hadnt met with any success so far.        
	The rebels did not raise slogans. Nor did they leave behind leaflets or posters claiming their hand in the abduction, Marwal said, but as Indwar is an intelligence official and the area is rebel-infested, we are sure its the handiwork of CPI (Maoists).         
	He said local residents claimed that those who abducted the official had been loitering around the market since this afternoon. They seemed to be waiting for Indwar, who stays near the market.

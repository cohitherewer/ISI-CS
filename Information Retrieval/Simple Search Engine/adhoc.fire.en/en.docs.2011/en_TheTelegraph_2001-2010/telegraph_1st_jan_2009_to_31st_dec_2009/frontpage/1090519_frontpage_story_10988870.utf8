  - CM skirts questions on offer to resign and Delhi meeting          OUR BUREAU                            Bhattacharjee leaves Writers Buildings on Monday. (Sanat Kumar Sinha)                                        
	Calcutta, May 18: Is it true that you have offered to resign?        
	No reply.        
	Will you step down as chief minister owning moral responsibility for the partys debacle?        
	No reply.        
	Why didnt you go to Delhi to attend the CPM politburo meeting?        
	No reply.        
	Silence has rarely been so eloquent in the corridors of Writers Buildings as when a grim-faced Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee walked out at 1.30pm for lunch at home.        
	Faced with a volley of questions whether he had offered to resign, the Bengal chief minister left without replying. The Telegraph had reported that the chief minister had offered to resign but CPM boss Prakash Karat had been trying to make him change his mind.        
	This is not the first time Bhattacharjee has faced tricky questions, and he usually deflects them by saying I dont reply to questions flung at me from the corridors.         
	But this afternoon, he opted for silence.         
	At 4.30pm, the chief minister returned to his office as usual. At 5.25pm, when policemen snapped to attention and got ready to escort the chief minister out, finance minister Asim Dasgupta, Bhattacharjees friend since their college days, walked into the chamber.        
	Seconds later, the two walked down the corridor, busy conversing with each other and ensuring that no more questions were asked. As soon as Bhattacharjee left Writers, Dasgupta headed back to his office.        
	The official reason Bhattacharjee did not go to Delhi also came under stress with the chief secretary saying he had briefed the chief minister on the days developments but there hadnt been any specific meeting on overall law and order. Yesterday, state industries minister Nirupam Sen, said to be close to Karat, had said the chief minister skipped the CPM politburo meeting because of post-poll violence in the districts.        
	If theres any major incident, we certainly keep the chief minister posted on that. But today, there was no specific meeting with the chief minister to discuss violence or law and order as the situation didnt warrant it, chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said.        
	At Jyoti Basus house during a 35-minute meeting, the patriarch is learnt to have described the poll debacle as a huge setback to the Left movement in the country. Sources said Basu was critical of the party leaderships decision to snap ties with the Congress on the nuclear deal and its subsequent association with parties like the BSP.        
	Politburo shields leadership        
	In Delhi, the CPM leadership appeared to be laying the ground to shield itself by veering towards a conclusion that decisions were taken collectively, not by individuals. This suggests the party leadership is not keen to see any heads roll at a time many leaders in Bengal are openly putting the blame on Prakash Karats line of burning bridges with the Congress.        
	CPM state secretary Biman Bose referred to the ineffectiveness of the third front plank but was outnumbered in the politburo by those who felt that local factors were responsible for the debacle. The 15-member politburo has three active members representing Bengal  Bose, Bhattacharjee (who skipped todays meeting) and Nirupam Sen. Mohammad Amin is also from the state but he represents Citu.        
	The feud in Kerala, where the Congress is the CPMs main enemy, also ensured that Bose found few supporters in the politburo as local issues hogged the limelight.

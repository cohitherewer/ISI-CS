The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Flu view: Do not overdo it
                                                                                                           Flu view: Do not overdo it
          G.S. MUDUR                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 10: India may be wasting resources and placing children at risk of side effects without good reason by giving the antiviral drug oseltamivir to every child infected with pandemic influenza, research suggests.        
	Medical experts also cautioned that India may be using up antiviral drug stocks without being able to clearly assess the severity of the pandemic in India because of decades of neglect of viral fevers.        
	A study released by Oxford University scientists today indicates that while oseltamivir can shorten the duration of seasonal flu in children by up to a day, it is unlikely to prevent flu complications. The study suggests that the antiviral has little effect on asthma flareups, increased risk of ear infections, or the need for antibiotic treatment among children with seasonal flu.         
	The Indian health ministry has been providing antiviral therapy to every patient -- child or adult -- infected with the pandemic H1N1 virus. Family members with no signs of flu symptoms have also been asked to take the treatment.        
	Health officials have argued that this treat-every-case policy is intended to prevent the spread of H1N1 into the community.         
	But the Oxford review of several previous trials of flu involving 1,766 children shows that antiviral therapy has only a small effect on preventing the spread of the virus. The review appears today in the British Medical Journal.        
	Its not very good in preventing spread, said Matthew Thompson, senior clinical scientist at Oxford University and a research team member. You need to treat 13 children to prevent one child from getting flu, Thompson told The Telegraph.        
	The review showed that the antiviral is linked to an increased risk of vomiting.         
	Sections of Indias medical community have also expressed concern about the governments policy of treating every patient, pointing out that the majority of patients have mild symptoms that can be treated just as any other flu.         
	Patients with mild symptoms may not need antiviral therapy, said Randeep Guleria, professor of medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi.        
	Most patients with flu only need to take bed rest, keep themselves well-hydrated, and use paracetamol to reduce fever -- while keeping watch for signs of serious illness such as breathlessness or high fever that doesnt go away or coloured sputum.        
	A meeting of medical experts called by the government today decided that India should stockpile an additional 20 million doses of oseltamivir. It had bought 10 million doses in May this year.         
	An official told The Telegraph that the issue of treating every case has been debated during meetings of experts, but there is no change in the antiviral drug treatment policy yet. More than 200 children have received the antiviral in India so far since the arrival of H1N1 in India in May this year.         
	Indias pandemic flu death count rose to seven and the number of infections climbed to 959 today, but doctors and virologists cautioned that an effort to assess the severity of this flu in India is handicapped by the lack of baseline flu mortality data.         
	Were groping in the dark, said Thekekkera Jacob John, former head of virology at the Christian Medical College, Vellore. Is this virus causing lower or more mortality than seasonal flu viruses in India? We dont know.        
	The US, which maintains a strong surveillance network for flu estimates, that about 36,000 people die from seasonal flu in that country every year. Over the first three months of the 2009 pandemic, 302 people had died from H1N1 infection.         
	The numbers from the US suggest that H1N1 is not any more virulent than seasonal flu viruses. India has no such numbers to compare. It is the price India is now paying for dismissing viral fevers for decades, one expert said.         
	Limited surveillance over the past five years and accounts from hospitals suggest India also has peak flu seasons and some patients have severe illness and pneumonia, said V.K. Vijayan, director of the Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute, New Delhi.         
	The Indian Council of Medical Research plans to this year launch the countrys first ever study to assess death rates from seasonal flu. A senior scientist at the ICMR told The Telegraph that influenza was not viewed as a public health problem in India. We have had to worry about dengue, malaria, Japanese encephalitis, diarrhoeal diseases -- they all claim far many more lives every year.

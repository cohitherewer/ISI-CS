          G.S. MUDUR                      Environment minister Jairam Ramesh                          
	New Delhi, Nov. 18: India has offered to submit a communication of all its domestic actions to combat climate change to the UN once every two years, environment ministry sources said today.         
	The country is prepared to submit a national communication about such actions, whether supported or unsupported by foreign funding, sources indicated today, outlining Indias latest position in global climate change talks.         
	Delegates from about 190 countries will converge in Copenhagen, Denmark, next month for talks on actions to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases beyond 2012.         
	Developing countries have been asking industrialised countries to adopt legally-binding cuts on emissions by 2020, while industrialised countries want India and other large emitters such as China to quantify how they will contribute to climate change mitigation and subject it to global scrutiny.         
	Brazil has announced it would cut 38 per cent of its emissions by 2020, mainly by reduced deforestation.         
	Indian officials have in the past asserted that domestic action that is not supported by foreign funding will not be subject to monitoring, reporting and verification  a process of international scrutiny to determine the progress a nation has made.         
	The sources said the proposed national communication describing supported and unsupported actions, their outcomes and their impacts on emissions will more than meet the demand for internationalisation of domestic commitments and obligations taken on unilaterally.         
	India has also offered to convert nationally appropriate mitigation actions into nationally accountable mitigation outcomes, specifying performance targets in industry, energy, transport, agriculture, buildings, and forestry for the period between 2020 and 2030, the sources said.

	Calcutta, May 24: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today virtually admitted that discontent related to land played a crucial role in the Left parties poll debacle and made it clear land acquisition would be put on the backburner for the remaining two years of his term, sources said.         
	The chief ministers specific observations before the CPM state committee did not find mention in the official party release which sought to strike a balance between both national and local reasons  the subject of a raging debate  behind the drubbing.        
	It is true that the all-India voting trend has also influenced the outcome in Bengal. Having said that, we cant ignore our shortcomings in the functioning of the government, the party, the Left Front, panchayats, municipalities and our mass organisation as well as in public relations. Accepting the peoples mandate, we will take corrective measures, the statement said, without making a direct reference to the land controversy.        
	However, sources told The Telegraph that several members raised the issue at the meeting, following which the chief minister responded. The sources said Bhattacharjee did not delve into the national issues as they were highlighted in an initial note distributed by state party secretary Biman Bose.        
	Bhattacharjee accepted the criticism against the state government and said that henceforth, he would proceed by accepting the peoples mandate.        
	The chief minister made it clear that he would abide by the peoples verdict which had gone against us on the land issue. From now on, he will take a flexible and cautious approach in pursuing the governments development goals, particularly those involving land acquisition. No major land acquisition will be carried out if the local people do not want it, a committee member said.        
	Bhattacharjee also stressed on what some members called a course correction. He spoke of time-bound implementation of rural development projects, including job-generating schemes, rural electrification, public health and education packages to win back voters who had deserted the Left, the sources said.         
	Bhattacharjee admitted that the governments style of functioning has to change to make it more accountable to poor people. He said the cabinet core committee would meet on May 28 to set guidelines to implement the governments priorities.        
	The state committee did touch upon the issues raised by the politburo last week  such as the failure of the third front and the voters perception that the Congress could provide stability.        
	Although the pro-Prakash Karat faction in the politburo had insisted that the withdrawal of support to the UPA and the vote against its government were ratified by the politburo and central committee unanimously, it was clear that the Bengal leadership wanted to debate both issues.        
	However, in line with its composition, the state committee utilised most of the latter half of the session to discuss local factors  the first time a party forum attempted to dissect such issues after the results were announced.        
	The criticism against the state party and the government largely revolved around disenchantment among the rural poor, which was blamed on the land acquisition programme. A committee member said the state governments hasty and forcible land acquisition and subsequent violence in Singur and Nandigram had alienated farmers.         
	Some leaders carried to the meeting the public criticism of the central leaderships decision to withdraw support to the UPA  articulating the deep divisions within the CPM  but others did not spare the local leadership either.        
	The state leadership is trying to absolve itself of responsibility. They must answer why the so-called Congress wave stopped at the border of Bihar and Orissa, a veteran member said        
	This section pointed out that the urban middle class, both Bengali and non-Bengali, did not come out overwhelmingly in support of the Left Front, belying the partys hope to cushion the loss elsewhere.        
	Todays meeting did not settle the question which factor was decisive in the poll debacle. The committee will wait for feedback from booth-level campaign committees as well as district committees before meeting again on June 11 and 12 for a full-fledged review.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Paris pearls vie with Palin lipstick
                                                                                                           Paris pearls vie with Palin lipstick
  - Oxford Book of Quotations features duo among great thinkers                                                  Paris Hilton (top) and Sarah Palin      
	Words of wisdom from Paris Hilton are to be immortalised alongside remarks by some of the greatest thinkers of all time in the latest edition of the Oxford Book of Quotations  and she reckons its so cool.        
	Hilton, the socialite turned reality TV star and retailing phenomenon, is listed in the latest version of the 65-year-old dictionary, released this week, with Confucius, Oscar Wilde and Stephen Hawking.        
	Her contribution? Dress cute wherever you go, life is too short to blend in.        
	Hilton, 28, was delighted to be featured in the book, which is a renowned list of memorable sayings.        
	So cool that I have a quote in the dictionary, she wrote on her Twitter page.        
	Another new entry in the seventh edition of the Oxford University Press publication is Sarah Palin. The former vice-presidential candidate makes the cut for her most famous quip: Whats the difference between a hockey mom and a pitbull? Lipstick.        
	More than 20,000 new quotations have been added to the dictionary but its compilers do not appear to have heard of Mamata Banerjee or Mallika Sherawat. One quote is credited to President Barack Obama, echoing words spoken by Martin Luther King Jr.: The arc of history is long, but it bends toward justice.        
	But, said Oxfords university linguists, it was also similar to a line from the US preacher Theodore Parker as long ago as 1853. Hesaid: The arc is a long one... and from what I see I am sure it bends towards justice.        
	Others came from British author Terry Pratchett  using embuggerance to describe his Alzheimers  and from Fay Weldon whos written over 20 novels: Guilt is to motherhood as grapes are to wine.                                
	The dictionary also publishes, for the first time, several quotes from the past, even a new one from Confucius.        
	This may be because they have been used or referenced by others in recent years or that the researchers have, after years, managed to source and verify them as genuine.        
	Some have taken on a whole new relevance, such as former US President Thomas Jefferson who died almost 200 years ago but said: Banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies.        
	The books editor, Elizabeth Knowles, said: Events may give an older utterance very topical significance  for example, Thomas Jefferson has for obvious reasons been quoted quite widely in the last year.        
	She added other quotes from the past sometimes become familiar to new audiences and much more widespread because of the internet.        
	She said: Anything quoted today, verbally or written in electronic form, can be and probably will be encountered by people all over the globe.        
	And as more data is added to online sources, more voices from the past find a route to us today. The new edition of the dictionary reflects the impact of these changes.        
	The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations probably did not consider Indian entries. Sherawats being a sex symbol is a lot of hard work hasnt made it.         
	Rakhi Sawant, alas, has also been missed. Poore earth par maine kabza kar liya hai. Mera dimaag jo hai na woh kuch alag hi sochti hai (All the world is in my grip. This mind of mine comes up with something different).        
	Written with Daily Telegraph and Reuters reports

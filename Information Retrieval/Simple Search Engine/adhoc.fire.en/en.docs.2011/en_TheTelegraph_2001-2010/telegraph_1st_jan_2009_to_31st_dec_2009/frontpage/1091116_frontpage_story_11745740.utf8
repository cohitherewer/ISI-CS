	Ahmedabad, Nov. 15: A burst in demand for the glitter has left the Surat diamond hub gasping.        
	A drop in the supply of rough diamond, caused by reduced production at downturn-affected companies, has hit the cutting and polishing industry in Gujarat, which has been showing signs of revival after almost a year of depression.         
	The high prices of rough diamond is bound to affect the profit margin. It is definitely a dampener for those awaiting a good season, said Rohit Mehta, president of the Surat Diamond Association.        
	BHP Billiton, among the largest mining companies in the world, has already increased rough diamond prices by 5 to 10 per cent. DTC, a leading distributor and a part of the De Beers family of companies, is about to follow suit, said industry sources.         
	The increase in prices has been triggered by the huge demand. Owners of large units are flush with orders for supplying polished diamond before Christmas and are on a shopping spree. It is a simple demand and supply principle which, unfortunately, does not apply to polished diamonds, said Mehta.         
	With demand ebbing from the US and Europe, diamond traders have started looking for newer markets: 70 per cent of the cut and polished diamonds are now being exported to Hong Kong, China, UAE, Israel and Australia.        
	Mehta explained that volatility in prices was nothing unusual, but our problem is that the prices of cut and polished diamond remains steady, even as rough prices go up.         
	Affected by the global meltdown, especially in the US and Europe, leading mining companies decided to cut down production around JanuaryFebruary this year.         
	Industry sources estimate that De Beers had slashed production by almost 90 per cent, and even now, it is producing at 40 per cent of its capacity.         
	Other companies such as BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto also reduced production substantially. Only Russian mining company Alrosa was an exception  it continued production but did not sell rough diamonds when the prices were low, the sources said.        
	However, Mehta hopes the rise in prices will be a temporary phase. The market is growing and the sentiments are strong and positive, he said.         
	As proof of this buoyancy, Mehta pointed out that the industry had announced 20 per cent bonus to workers, most of whom have started returning to their units which reopened yesterday after the Diwali vacation.         
	Adding to the cheer is the return of workers, who had switched to embroidery units following the downturn. One attraction is the bouquet of welfare schemes diamond units offer workers and their families, prime among them educational and healthcare aid.         
	The numbers, given out by the Gems and Jewellery Exports Promotion Council, also suggest a positive story. Although the export of polished diamond from India to the US  the worlds biggest market (60 per cent in the halcyon days)  decreased by 30 per cent in the first six months of the current fiscal and stood at $1,791 million compared with $2,527 million in the corresponding period of 2008, exports to Hong Kong and China grew nearly 9 per cent.        
	Polished diamond exports to Hong Kong in the first half of this financial year stood at $3,126 million compared with $2,853 million in the same period last year. In September alone, exports increased by almost 10 per cent to $1,762 million compared with $1,589 million in the corresponding month last year.

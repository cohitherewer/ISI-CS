The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | More flu-fight doses in a week
                                                                                                           More flu-fight doses in a week
          G.S. MUDUR                               
	New Delhi, April 30: India has decided to increase its stockpile of the antiviral drug oseltamivir ten-fold to brace itself for a possible swine flu pandemic that the World Health Organisation has said is now imminent.         
	The health ministry will increase its stocks from one million doses to 10 million doses  sufficient to treat about 714,000 people  within seven days, and distribute the medicine among the states, a senior official said.         
	The stock will be completely decentralised, strategically located in every state, Vineet Chawdhry, a joint secretary in the ministry, said.         
	Oseltamivir is one of two antiviral drugs that have been found to be effective in reducing the severity of the disease caused by the swine flu virus when used early. India had been stocking on it since the outbreak of bird flu three years ago.         
	The ministry has activated passenger screening at six international airports and alerted a nationwide disease surveillance system to look out for people with influenza symptoms, and will seek the assistance of private doctors to intensify surveillance. India remains free of swine flu so far, Chawdhry said.         
	The Centre will send guidelines for swine flu diagnosis to the Indian Medical Association tomorrow and ask it to circulate them among its members. But oseltamivir is not available for retail sale and treatment will be available only in public hospitals.         
	We want doctors to report suspicious cases to us, an official said. We want the public to take the simple precautions  washing hands with soap and water frequently and covering coughs and sneezes.         
	Officials said a 27-year-old passenger from Texas who had arrived in Hyderabad on April 28 had developed a cold, but had no symptoms of influenza. However, his clinical samples have been sent for laboratory testing.         
	Health officials said they have estimated that about 50,000 people have arrived in India over the past 10 days from countries affected by swine flu. But specific numbers  such as the number who arrived from Mexico  remain unavailable.         
	A senior drug industry official told The Telegraph that local manufacturing capacity may be able to deliver up to 140 million doses of oseltamivir per month  equivalent for treating up to 10 million patients a month.         
	Indias antiviral stockpile is relatively low compared to its population. But public health officials point out that unlike in North America and Europe, seasonal flu has never been viewed as a major health problem in India so a large stockpile becomes impractical.         
	Whether our capacity is sufficient to meet demand would depend on how this epidemic evolves in the coming months, the industry official said.         
	The US Centers for Disease Control has sent protocols  a set of rules  to develop biological material that will be used to detect the new strain of swine flu that appears to have first struck in Mexico and has now spread to four continents.         
	The National Institute of Communicable Diseases, New Delhi, and the National Institute of Virology, Pune, have been tasked with confirming swine flu infections through validated tests  if patients with suspicious symptoms are detected.

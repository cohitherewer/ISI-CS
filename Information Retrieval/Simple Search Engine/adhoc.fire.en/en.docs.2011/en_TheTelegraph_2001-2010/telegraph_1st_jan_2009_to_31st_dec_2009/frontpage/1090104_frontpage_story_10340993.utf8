                                                                                                           Sorens chopper, Peters punch     On last day, a rush of promises 
          AMIT GUPTA                      I am like your son and have been in your service for long. I will be here for you whether I win or lose. The chief ministers primary tormentor and Jharkhand Party (Anosh) nominee Raja Peter is all humility on the last day of campaigning in Tamar on Saturday.

	Bundu-Tamar (Ranchi), Jan. 3: Shibu Soren used a chopper, Raja Peter was on a padyatra and Vasundhara Devi preferred to go door-to-to door on the last day of campaigning for the January 5 Tamar by-election that is set to make or break the chief ministerial career of Guruji.        
	The contest has as many as 15 candidates but the moot question is whether Soren can make it to the Assembly to remain chief minister till Jharkhand faces the next Assembly elections in 2010.         
	In this quest, he has now to contend with Peter  fielded by one-time cabinet colleague Anosh Ekka and Vasundhara, the widow of former MLA Ramesh Singh Munda, whose death has necessitated the byelection.        
	Today, Soren used a hired chopper to make a whirlwind trip to address rallies in the three blocks of the Naxalite-hit constituency  Arki, Tamar and Bundu; his primary contender Gopal Krishna Patar, alias Raja Peter, of Jharkhand Party (Anosh) preferred to walk through densely populated areas to show off his Robinhood credentials; while Vasundhara met voters at their doorstep and addressed a public meeting at Bhuiyandih with JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav by her side.        
	Former home minister Sudesh Mahto decided the best way to round off his partys campaign would be to have 550 bikers zip through busy rural haats to garner support for Ajsus Vijay Singh Manki.         
	At Purana bazaar toli in Bundu, Peter was at his humble best. I am like your son and have been in your service for long. I will be here for you whether I win or lose, he said, with folded hands.         
	But others will leave you in both the circumstances. So please vote for me as I really care for you, he told Birendra Prasad Bhagat, an elderly person who said he was once a ward commissioner in the Bundu notified area committee.        
	Raja Peter hi jitega (It is Peter who will win), Bhagat belted out soon after. Peters charm seemed to have worked.        
	About a kilometre away was the venue of Sorens third meeting of the day. It was the Bundu football ground along NH-33 where a waiting crowd of around a thousand was busy discussing what changes a chief minister could possibly bring in one year.         
	An exhausted Soren reached the grounds along with HRD minister Bandhu Tirkey around 2.40pm.         
	He made the most of the 20 minutes he had for campaigning to end.        
	I urge you people to vote for a chief minister. You have to take an important decision, so think twice before casting your vote. Other candidates might entice you with several things, but do not fall prey to their tactics. If I fail to perform within your expectations, you have every right to throw me out in the next elections which is not far away, he said.         
	Congressmen like Barhi MLA Manoj Yadav, NSUI activists and local functionaries were there to pledge support to Soren.         
	At Adelhatu village nearby, Vasundhara was in a hurry. Looking confident in her green cotton sari, she wanted to knock on as many as doors as she could.         
	Do not forget me. My husband has sacrificed his life for the people of Tamar. Please give me a chance to develop the area, she said before rushing to Bhuiyandih to share the dais with Sharad Yadav.         
	Yadav played his part. He took on Soren and said he had failed to deliver during his stint as chief minister during the last four months. His (Sorens) soft corner for extremists has been proved by his statements. People do not want a leader who cannot protect them, he added.         
	At the Bundu market area, Ajsu bikers zipped passed waving their party flags. We will create history by winning these polls as we did in Silli. We have the support of youths and Mahtos, said Sudesh Kumar Mahto, who emerged as the dark horse and won the Silli seat as an Independent.        
	District sub-election officer C.K.Singh told The Telegraph that a total of around 1,500 government officials had been sent today to Bundu and Tamar, from where they will be shifted to the 247 polling booths by tomorrow afternoon.         
	With 15 candidates in fray, a single control unit and ballot unit of EVMs will be used at each booth.

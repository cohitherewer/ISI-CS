The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Assets notice to ex-ministers
                                                                                                           Assets notice to ex-ministers
          CHANDRAJIT MUKHERJEE                            Sahi, Tirkey                                 
	Ranchi, May 12: Jharkhand High Court today slapped showcause notices on five former ministers in the disproportionate assets case registered against them.        
	A division bench of Chief Justice Gyan Sudha Misra and Justice D.K. Sinha directed former ministers Dulal Bhuiyan, Bhanu Pratap Sahi, Kamlesh Singh, Bandhu Tirkey and Chandra Prakash Choudhary to explain why a CBI probe should not be ordered into their assets, alleged to be more than their known sources of income.        
	The sudden decision of the court was sparked off by a state report, which revealed that their assets were not disproportionate to their known sources of income. The state, in its affidavit, told the court that it had not received any information or data from the income-tax department that could indicate that the ministers had amassed disproportionate assets.        
	The court has given a 10-day deadline to the former ministers to file their reply.        
	The affidavit of the state was, however, thwarted by the income-tax department, which refuted the stand.         
	The counsel for the state income-tax chief commissioner told the court that despite several applications and notices, none of the former ministers had filed any reply or furnished details of their assets and income to work out their individual assets profile and to check whether those were more than their revealed sources of income.        
	The I-T department has to follow the statute, which makes it mandatory for the office to issue notices to income-tax assessees and allow them an opportunity to explain acquisition of their assets with regards to their incomes.         
	The ministers have been sent notices more than once and no one has bothered to come out with data. In the absence of details, the department cannot work out an assets sheet of individual ministers, the counsel said.        
	The matter had come up in a PIL filed by one Durga Oraon who has alleged amassing of enormous assets by the ministers through illegal means.         
	The PIL filed in September 2008 had opened a can of worms for the then government, which has had a rather difficult time trying to safeguard the former ministers.         
	The petitioner has sought a CBI inquiry into the matter for impartial investigation before which the court had directed the state and the income-tax department to inquire independently and inform the bench whether the former ministers were actually guilty of amassing assets more than their incomes.

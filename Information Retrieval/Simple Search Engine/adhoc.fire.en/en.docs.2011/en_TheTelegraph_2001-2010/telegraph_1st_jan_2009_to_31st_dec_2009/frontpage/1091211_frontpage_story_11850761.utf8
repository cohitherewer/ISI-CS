										      Amit Roy                                     
	Stockholm, Dec. 10: Big questions of life and death were tackled today when President Barack Obama received the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo while Venkatraman Ramakrishnan accepted the Nobel Prize for chemistry in Stockholm.         
	The two events were separated by only a few hours and yet there was a link.         
	Referring twice to Mahatma Gandhi, Obama rose to the occasion, addressed not only the assembled distinguished gathering but also citizens of the world and insisted that in the midst of death life must persist.         
	Ramakrishnan, meanwhile, who received his medal along with two other Laureates in chemistry, three in physics, 3 in physiology, one in literature and two in economics, was honoured for his research into ribosomes  the complex proteins that turn inert DNA genetic codes literally into life.         
	The work into ribosomes is considered the most profound since Crick and Watson unravelled the double helix of the DNA.         
	In the audience at the concert hall in Stockholm was Venkis sister, Lalita Ramakrishnan, who caused a stir by wearing a green sari.         
	Over in Norway, Obama, with wife Michelle in a gold outfit, arrived by motorcade at Oslo City Hall to a fanfare of trumpets. Seated at the front were King Harald of Norway, Queen Sonja, Crown Prince Haakon and his glamorous blonde wife, Mette-Marit.         
	It is estimated that tight security in Oslo cost, at least, 10 times Obamas Dollar1.4m prize money.         
	Keenly aware that many think that giving the peace prize to Obama so early in his presidency was, at best, premature, the US president tempered his justification for war with an appeal to the philosophy of Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr (who had also received the Nobel Peace Prize).         
	The non-violence practised by men like Gandhi and King may not have been practical or possible in every circumstance, but the love that they preached  their faith in human progress  must always be the North Star that guides us on our journey, Obama urged.         
	Earlier, he had spoken of the power of non-violence: We must begin by acknowledging the hard truth that we will not eradicate violent conflict in our lifetimes. There will be times when nations  acting individually or in concert  will find the use of force not only necessary but morally justified.         
	He went on: I make this statement mindful of what Martin Luther King said in this same ceremony years ago, Violence never brings permanent peace. It solves no social problem: it merely creates new and more complicated ones. As someone who stands here as a direct consequence of Dr Kings lifes work, I am living testimony to the moral force of non-violence. I know there is nothing weak, nothing passive, nothing naive in the creed and lives of Gandhi and King.         
	Obama was introduced by Thorbjrn Jagland, chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, who gave a long speech defending the decision to recognise Obama on October 9 for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.         
	The committee has attached special importance to Obamas vision of and work for a world free from nuclear weapons, the citation had added.         
	Jagland, a former Norwegian prime minister and foreign minister, launched into a detailed analysis of the international situation: This years award must be viewed in the light of the prevailing situation in the world.         
	Jagland did Obama no favours by appearing to be almost a cheerleader for a Democratic presidential contender.         
	He said others had received a peace award when their work had just begun and was applauded when he compared Obama with King. Many have been awarded the Peace Prize for their courage, even when the results for a long time seemed modest: Carl von Ossietzky, Andrej Sakharov, Lech Walesa and the Dalai Lama, to name a few. When Albert Lutuli received his Peace Prize, the struggle against apartheid was in its infancy.         
	When Martin Luther King Jr received his award, Jagland also said, he had proclaimed his dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the colour of their skin but by the content of their character, but there was still a long way to go from dream to reality. Mr President, we are happy to see that through your presence here so much of Dr Kings dream has come true.         
	Central to Jaglands argument was the assertion: The question was actually quite simple. Who has done most for peace in the past year? If the question is put in (Alfred) Nobels terms, the answer is relatively easy to find: it had to be US President Barack Obama.         
	In the days, months and probably years ago, Obamas Nobel Prize speech, which he had drafted himself with the help of his senior advisers, will be analysed into what he said and what he might have said but didnt.         
	It will be recognised as one of his most compelling performances, perhaps his best yet, for he tackled the fundamental questions of war and peace and the apparent contradiction in a recipient of the peace prize sending young men into battle.         
	I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the considerable controversy that your generous decision has generated, he told those who had given him the prize.         
	In part, this is because I am at the beginning, and not the end, of my labours on the world stage. Compared to some of the giants of history who have received this prize  Schweitzer and King; Marshall and Mandela  my accomplishments are slight. But perhaps the most profound issue surrounding my receipt of this prize is the fact that I am the Commander-in-Chief of a nation in the midst of two wars. One of these wars is winding down. The other is a conflict that America did not seek, he said.         
	He was candid: Still, we are at war, and I am responsible for the deployment of thousands of young Americans to battle in a distant land. Some will kill. Some will be killed. And so I come here with an acute sense of the cost of armed conflict  filled with difficult questions about the relationship between war and peace, and our effort to replace one with the other.         
	He addressed the notion of a just war: The concept of a just war emerged, suggesting that war is justified only when it meets certain preconditions: if it is waged as a last resort or in self-defence; if the forced used is proportional; and if, whenever possible, civilians are spared from violence.         
	The organisations that had held the peace in the last century were now being tested. A decade into a new century, this old architecture is buckling under the weight of new threats. The world may no longer shudder at the prospect of war between two nuclear superpowers, but proliferation may increase the risk of catastrophe. Terrorism has long been a tactic, but modern technology allows a few small men with outsized rage to murder innocents on a horrific scale.         
	His solution?         
	I do not bring with me today a definitive solution to the problems of war, he said. What I do know is that meeting these challenges will require the same vision, hard work and persistence of those men and women who acted so boldly decades ago. And it will require us to think in new ways about the notions of just war and the imperatives of a just peace.         
	Again he was direct. There will be times when nations  acting individually or in concert  will find the use of force not only necessary but morally justified.         
	Where force is necessary, we have a moral and strategic interest in binding ourselves to certain rules of conduct, he argued. And even as we confront a vicious adversary that abides by no rules, I believe that the United States of America must remain a standard bearer in the conduct of war. That is what makes us different from those whom we fight. That is a source of our strength. That is why I prohibited torture. That is why I ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed. And that is why I have reaffirmed Americas commitment to abide by the Geneva Conventions. We lose ourselves when we compromise the very ideals that we fight to defend.         
	There were reference to events such as Mumbai 26/11. We see it in the way that religion is used to justify the murder of innocents by those who have distorted and defiled the great religion of Islam, and who attacked my country from Afghanistan. These extremists are not the first to kill in the name of God; the cruelties of the Crusades are amply recorded. But they remind us that no Holy War can ever be a just war.         
	In Stockholm, Professor Mans Ehrenberg, a member of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry, said that the prize was being given for studies of the structure and function of the ribosome.         
	He said: Venkatraman Ramakrishnans crystal structures of the small ribosomal sub-unit in functional complexes led to atomic level understanding of how ribosome assisted reading of the genetic code can be so accurate that virtually all proteins are made error free in accordance with the blueprints of their genes.         
	Ramakrishnan and fellow winner Thomas Steitz, an American, looked elegant in tails, while the third member of the group, Ada Yonath of Israel, wore black.         
	Then came the critical moment as though the three were back at a school prize giving with Ehrenberg saying: Professors Ramakrishnan, Steitz and Yonath, you are being awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the crystallographic determination of ribosome structures at high resolution and for the skilful use of the structures to clarify fundamental and medically important aspects of ribosome function. On behalf of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, I wish to convey to you our warmest congratulations and I now ask you to step forward to receive your Nobel Prizes from the hands of His Majesty the King.         
	Ramakrishnan beamed as he was the first to step forward to shake hands with King Carl Gustav of Sweden. He bowed twice as his sister was seen applauding enthusiastically.         
	Ramakrishnan was followed by Thomas Steitz and Ada Yonath.         
	The ceremony was followed by what the Nobel committee members like best  an elaborate royal banquet.

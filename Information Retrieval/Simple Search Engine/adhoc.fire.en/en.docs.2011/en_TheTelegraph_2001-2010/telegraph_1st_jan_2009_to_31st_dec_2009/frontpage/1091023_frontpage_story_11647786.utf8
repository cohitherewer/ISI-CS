                                                                                                           Congress sweeps Arunachal     Apang, son lose, Trinamul   debuts
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                                 
	Itanagar, Oct. 22: The Congress today retained power in Arunachal Pradesh though some of its stalwarts, including former chief minister and seven-time MLA Gegong Apang, had to bite the dust.         
	The ruling Congress won 41 seats, including the three it had won uncontested in the 60-member Assembly till 7.30pm, the Election Commission said. Debutant Trinamul Congress won five.         
	The BJP, the NCP and the Peoples Party of Arunachal won two, five and four seats respectively.         
	Only one Independent could wrest a seat.         
	The Apangs suffered a double blow as the former chief ministers son, Omak Apang, a former Union minister and sitting MLA, also lost.         
	It could well be termed as the waterloo for veteran Apang who secured 3,457 votes to lose to NCPs Alo Libang, who secured 4,827 votes, from Tuting Yingkiong segment.         
	Omak, who secured 4,868 votes, was defeated by the BJPs Tangor Tapak who secured 5,529 votes.         
	Some of the leading Congress names who were defeated include education minister Tatar Kipa, PHE minister Lombo Tayeng, the advisor to the chief minister, Tsering Gyurmey, former deputy chief minister Kameng Dolo and former MLA T.L. Rajkumar.         
	But this hardly bothered the Congress, which gloated over its victory by terming it the peoples victory. Euphoric supporters burst crackers in front of the Congress headquarters at Rajiv Bhavan here this evening.         
	Chief minister Dorjee Khandu and PCC president Nabam Tuki said in a joint press conference that the victory was the result of all the good work done by the Congress-led UPA government at the Centre and the Congress government in the state.         
	We are reaping the benefits of the people-oriented policy formulated by the Congress-led government at the Centre and its timely and proper implementation by the Congress government in the state, Khandu, who had won uncontested, said.         
	Even before the polls, we had declared that the Congress was certain to form the government without any hassle. The peoples mandate went in our favour because of our all-out effort to implement welfare schemes in less than three years, he added.         
	Khandu said only the Congress had fielded candidates for all the 60 seats. No other party could even dream of this.         
	Tuki, who defeated his NCP rival Tad Tana from Sagalee, said the Congress would continue the good work with the Centre continuing to shower its bounties on the state. We are crossing the 40-seat mark and this is the result of the cohesive effort of party workers to steer the party to an almost effortless win, Tuki said.         
	He added that the Opposition parties, which had talked big before the polls by saying they would give the ruling party a tough fight, had proved to be no match.         
	We are not bothered about the losers as our job is to strengthen the hand of the Congress and to steer Arunachal towards progress in the years to come. Our win is the result of a cohesive effort and the good work will continue, Nabam Rebia, who won from Doimukh, said just after the press conference.

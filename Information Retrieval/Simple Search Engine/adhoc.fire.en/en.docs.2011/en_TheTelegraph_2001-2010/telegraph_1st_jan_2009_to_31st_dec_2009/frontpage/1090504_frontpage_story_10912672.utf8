  - Supreme Court orders Ranchi Womens College to vacate Katras House          AMIT GUPTA amp; PTI                                           
	Ranchi/New Delhi, May 3: Ranchi University has lost a legal battle of a Rs 20-crore property in the heart of the state capital.        
	Katras House, taken over by the government 70 years ago for military purposes when the World War II broke out, will now be handed over to its owners following a Supreme Court directive.        
	A division bench of Justices Dalveer Bhandari and H.S. Bedi directed the current tenant, Ranchi Womens College, which has a hostel in the dilapidated structure, to vacate the premises within two months, failing which the authorities will have to evict the occupants.        
	The apex court passed the order while allowing the appeal filed by the owners and estate management firm, Roy Estate, seeking possession of the building, which, it said, could collapse any moment endangering lives of the occupants.        
	About 60 humanities department students of Ranchi Womens College stay at Katras House.        
	Ajit Kumar Sahay, the co-ordinator of college development council of Ranchi University, told The Telegraph that they would abide by the Supreme Court order. But I must say that land mafia are behind the scene. They want to grab it by hook or crook, said Sahay, the custodian of immovable properties of the university.        
	The courts decision came after a 14-year struggle by the owners to get possession of the disputed building spread over 1.7 acres  which costs at least Rs 20 crore now  in upscale the Circular Road area.        
	The building was initially owned by late Ganesh Chandra Dey who purchased the same by a registered sale deed dated January 26, 1933. It was requisitioned after the World War II broke out on September 3, 1939, to house part of the armys eastern command. Then Viceroy promulgated the Defence of India Ordinance, 1939, empowering the central government to take over any property necessary for securing the defence of British India and other related matters.        
	However, after Independence, the property was transferred in 1958 to the principal of Ranchi Womens College. In July 1995, the owner of the property through his attorney, Roy Estate, filed an eviction case against the college.                                
	On November 23 last year, Ranchi Municipal Corporation issued an inspection report that the building was in a dangerous and uninhabitable state and a direction was issued under Section 247 (1) of the Ranchi Municipal Corporation Act, 2001, that the building, which had been declared as dangerous, should either be demolished or subjected to extensive repairs to make it habitable.         
	However, as the college refused to vacate the premises, the dispute lumbered for over 14 years before it reached the apex court. The Supreme Court, after examining relevant provisions of rules relating to the buildings requisition by the government during World War II, said the authorities had no right to allot the same to a college as the original intention behind the requisition was for official purposes.        
	In other words, since the official purpose no longer existed and as the building was handed over to a college without any authority, the same was illegal, the bench said. Hence, it directed the college to hand over the property to the present owner along with Rs 1 lakh cost towards litigation.        
	The university registrar, Jyoti Kumar, said he was yet to see the details of the court verdict but he had been informed by its counsel Gopal Prasad about the same. The universitys next course of action would depend on the exact verdict of the Supreme Court, Kumar said.        
	Interestingly, Katras House has been illegally occupied by over 100 families who stay on the periphery of the main building at makeshift and permanent huts. It would be a Herculean task to evacuate the premises from the illegal occupants, said a university official.

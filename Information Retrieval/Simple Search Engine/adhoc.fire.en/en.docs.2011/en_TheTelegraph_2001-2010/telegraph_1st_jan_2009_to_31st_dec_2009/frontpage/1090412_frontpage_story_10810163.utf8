	Underhill (Vermont), April 11: At sea he is intense and resolute, so when Captain Richard Phillips tried to escape his pirate captors yesterday by leaping off their slow-moving lifeboat, some of his closest friends did not blink.        
	But at home, friends and relatives said, Captain Phillips, 53, is a consummate regular guy who worships Boston sports teams, particularly the Celtics, plays basketball at the YMCA, plays golf with retirees and faithfully picks up muffins for Sunday brunch with his family.         
	When he is away, plying dangerous ocean waters as a merchant ship captain, the image his neighbours here remember is of him placidly riding his lawnmower.         
	Now he is at the centre of an extraordinary international incident. When he went for that swim today, it didnt surprise me at all, said Peter Wakefield, who grew up with the captain outside Boston and visited him last month. Hes got good intuition, and hes a very determined guy.         
	A few weeks ago, Captain Phillips was wrapping up three months of downtime with ordinary fun. He snowboarded during Wakefields visit, filled out brackets for a college basketball tournament pool and had a quiet farewell dinner with his extended family before heading back to sea.        
	He has never been into big goodbyes, said Tom Coggio, his brother-in-law, who lives nearby. For Richard, its just a job.        
	As Captain Phillips spent a fourth day as the lone hostage of Somali pirates who attacked his cargo ship on Wednesday off the Horn of Africa, friends and relatives here in Underhill and around New England spoke of the two sharply contrasting sides of the man: the professional one, meticulous and highly competent; and the off-duty one, affable, humourous and content to play basketball, go snowmobiling and do chores around the house.         
	He was a different guy when he was out to sea, Coggio said yesterday. He was very by-the-book.         
	Captain Phillips grew up with seven brothers and sisters in Winchester, Massachusetts, a close-knit town where his father coached high school basketball. He played varsity football, lacrosse and basketball, said Donald Carey, a childhood neighbour who recalled him as modest and wryly funny.        
	Never any fanfare out of this guy, said Carey, who has not seen the captain in years. If you went to a picnic and forgot your lunch, hed give you half of his.        
	While Captain Phillipss family hunkered down yesterday, the standoff near the coast of Somalia intensified as American naval reinforcements moved in. There were also reports that the four pirates, desperate to reach shore with their captive, also had called in additional vessels and men.        
	The French authorities, meanwhile, said they had sent forces to end a separate hostage-taking by pirates elsewhere off Somalia, one of the most notoriously lawless stretches of international waters.         
	The operation left one hostage and two pirates dead.        
	American defence officials have so far been reluctant to take such an aggressive approach to rescuing Captain Phillips, who was seized when the pirates commandeered his American-flagged container ship, the Maersk Alabama.

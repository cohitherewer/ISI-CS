The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Advani signal in Raje exit
                                                                                                           Advani signal in Raje exit
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              Raje, Advani				                                 
	New Delhi, Oct. 23: Vasundhara Raje today stepped down as leader of the BJP legislature party in Rajasthan, possibly portending the early exit of L.K. Advani as Opposition leader.        
	The resignation of Raje, who had defied party chief Rajnath Singhs quit directive for months on one pretext or another  from viral illness to a flawed planetary configuration and the Assembly elections  was promptly accepted by the parliamentary board.        
	Till yesterday, Raje had hoped to buy more time using the November 7 Rajasthan bypolls as a plea. But Advani, who is said to have protected her all along, threw up his hands when Raje called on him this morning and advised her to quit without fuss.        
	Sections of the BJP are convinced that Rajes exit would pave the way for Advanis departure as leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, and that this could happen before Parliament sits on November 19. The RSS is keen that the veteran quit before that, though none would confirm this on record.        
	The national executive, earlier scheduled for October 28-29, is now expected in the first week of November. It is likely to set in motion a process that will culminate in changes at the top, the exercise acquiring a sense of urgency after the latest poll reverses.        
	The RSS and sections of the BJP are convinced that unless a central command of authority is reinstated and leaders become stakeholders in the partys survival and growth, instead of being partisan and ego-centric, the state leaders and cadres will remain unmotivated.        
	Sources said that if things were allowed to drift, the party should be prepared for reverses also in Jharkhand, where elections are scheduled in November-December.        
	The objective conditions are ripe for an NDA victory. But if our leaders in Delhi keep squabbling, there is no way they can put the house in order in Jharkhand where Arjun Munda and Yashwant Sinha are baying for each others blood, a leader said.        
	Even as she resigned, Raje challenged Rajnaths authority. She despatched a one-line letter to him and sent a copy to Advani to which she appended a personal missive, asking why she alone was held culpable for the BJPs defeat in the Lok Sabha polls in Rajasthan.        
	Without attacking Rajnath by name, she asked if accountability would be fixed on the leaders in charge of the Maharashtra and Haryana polls.        
	Sources said Raje played the gender card and alleged she was humiliated because she was a woman.

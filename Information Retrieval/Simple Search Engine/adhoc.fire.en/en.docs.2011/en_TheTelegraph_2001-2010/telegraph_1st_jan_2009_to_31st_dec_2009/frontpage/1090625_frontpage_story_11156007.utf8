          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Shillong, June 24: The new DoNER minister, B.K. Handique, today admitted that procedural problems were the culprit for the slow project sanctioning method in the Northeast, where funds worth over Rs 1,000 crore have remained unutilised under the non-lapsable central pool of resources since 1996.        
	The DoNER ministry takes care of the non-lapsable central pool of resources  a pool of 10 per cent funds each from every ministry earmarked every fiscal for the Northeast  and disburses it.        
	Since 1996, Rs 5,400 crore have been released by the Centre to the seven states of the Northeast, Handique told reporters at the end of a meeting of all the chief ministers of the Northeast.        
	So far, Rs 4,400 crore have been utilised and efforts are on to implement these projects in a time-bound manner.        
	The Union minister said the meeting expressed the need to ensure proper and speedy utilisation of funds.         
	We want the states to utilise the funds in a transparent manner so that the people at the grassroots reap the fruits of development, Handique said.         
	DoNER is still examining the hurdles which stand in the way of implementing projects in the Northeast, he said.         
	Of the procedural problems, the prime one was rejection of projects proposed by the Northeast by central departments.        
	A technical committee has been formed under DoNER to see that the project proposals from various northeastern states are not rejected by the central government departments, Handique said.         
	We will strengthen the technical wing of the DoNER department with more experts to help the states, Handique said, adding that the states can even seek help from at IITs to prepare the detailed project reports.        
	The number of projects approved by DoNER for the Northeast is 1,025, of which 460 projects have been completed, including those under the Bodo Territorial Council (BTC).         
	While the chief ministers of Manipur, Meghalaya, Tri-pura and Nagaland attended todays meeting in Shillong, other states were represented by cabinet ministers.

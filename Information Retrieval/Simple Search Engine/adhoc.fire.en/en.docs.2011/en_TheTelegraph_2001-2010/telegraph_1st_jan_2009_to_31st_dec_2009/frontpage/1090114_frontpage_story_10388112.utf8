          A STAFF REPORTER                       The retired army driver                          
	Calcutta, Jan. 13: A cross-border courier of Lashkar-e-Toiba militants and explosives was picked up last night from the Malda home of a retired army driver who was arrested today.        
	Shafiqul, a Bangladeshi accused of smuggling men and RDX into India through the Murshidabad border, was celebrating the wedding of the former naiks daughter when the CID arrived to make what police are terming one of the biggest arrests in recent times in Bengal.        
	We saw four persons in plainclothes arrive at the house around 11pm, a witness said. They strode in and asked for Shafiqul. Some people called him and as he came out of the house, the four arrested him. It was then that we realised they were policemen.        
	The bride and the groom had left, but guests were still milling around at the home of Haji Akhtar Hussain when the CID team arrived.        
	Hussain, a naik in the Indian Army who retired in 1992, was taken for questioning and released around morning. But he was summoned to the police station again in the evening, where he was first questioned and then arrested.         
	The former soldier, whose last posting was in what is now Uttarakhand, is accused of providing Shafiqul, 32, shelter and helping him set up a tyre shop in Siliguri from where the Bangladeshi wanted to keep track of army movements in north Bengal.         
	Both men have been charged with waging war against the nation and criminal conspiracy. If the charges are proved, this will be a rare instance when a former Indian Army soldier would be found involved in cross-border terror.        
	Hussain claims he met Shafiqul only on Sunday afternoon at Harishchandrapur station, where the younger man asked him for money saying his pocket had been picked.         
	The former army driver told the police he asked Shafiqul to come and work at his house for a few days as his daughter was getting married. He could earn money and return to Murshidabad, where Shafiqul said he lived, Hussain claims to have told him.        
	We dont buy his story, deputy inspector-general (operations) S.N. Gupta said. We have enough evidence to prove that the two were in close contact for the last few years.        
	The CID was looking for Shafiqul since July 2008, when they learnt he had taken shelter in a Murshidabad hideout while transporting two Pakistani Lashkar militants to Lucknow on way to Jammu and Kashmir the previous May. The hideout was raided and Shafiqul declared an absconder.         
	Gupta said that after the Mumbai attacks in November, Shafiqul visited Siliguri but failed to set up shop there. He then got in touch with Hussain and asked for his help. The two were to leave for Siliguri tomorrow, the officer said.

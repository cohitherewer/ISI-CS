The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Govt sets terms for Sulfa cases
                                                                                                           Govt sets terms for Sulfa cases
  - 5-phase move to sieve   non-heinous crimes        A STAFF REPORTER                                           
	Guwahati, Feb. 5: Dispur has set tough guidelines for the withdrawal of criminal cases pending against surrendered Ulfa (Sulfa) cadres, dashing any hopes they might have harboured of putting their past behind them at the earliest.         
	The move is essentially aimed at non-heinous criminal cases. Yet the government has initiated a five-phase process, indicating that it would be a long haul for the former rebels as Dispur does not want to be seen as being soft towards them.         
	The government is yet to take a call on the withdrawal of heinous cases. Nevertheless, it has asked for a list of such cases registered against any Sulfa cadre for perusal.         
	The Sulfa cadres, numbering around 13,000, have been demanding the withdrawal of cases pending against them just as it was done in the case of former rebels of the Bodo Liberation Tigers.         
	A Sulfa delegation had called on Governor S.C. Mathur last month to request the withdrawal of cases pending against them and to seek a rehabilitation package of Rs 1.5 lakh and a monthly stipend of Rs 2,000 each till the package was granted. They also appealed for early talks between the government and Ulfa.         
	The request came after the cabinet decided late last year to set tough guidelines for withdrawal of cases pending against Sulfa cadres. The home department prepared the guidelines subsequently and sent it to the district administrations recently, sources said.         
	In the first of the five phases of the guidelines the home department has asked the district administrations to prepare a list of heinous and non-heinous crimes registered against Sulfa cadres and send them to the director-general of police and the additional DGP of the CID along with details of the cadres, date of surrender and their conduct since.         
	The CID will examine the list and send its recommendation to the home department, which will constitute a committee to go through the non-heinous cases.         
	The committee will then direct the district administration to move the courts through the public prosecutor for withdrawal of the non-heinous crimes.         
	After that the home department will constitute another committee to look into the heinous cases.         
	It will also refer cases, in which properties and personnel of the Union government have been affected, to Delhi for approval.         
	Lastly, the government guidelines state that only those cases, where a former rebel completes three years of surrender and whose conduct is found to be satisfactory, will be recommended. This clearly shows that the government is treading cautiously vis--vis withdrawal of even non-heinous cases. From all accounts, the former rebels will be disappointed if they had harboured hopes of any early let-off. There are still a lot of ifs and buts, a source in Dispur said.         
	The president of Ex-Ulfa Co-ordination Committee, Sunti Saikia, who surrendered in 2000, is keeping his fingers crossed.         
	We are hopeful going by the assurance of the governor. But if we go by our earlier experiences, we are keeping our fingers crossed. This is the first attempt to get the cases withdrawn by the government. What we want to impress upon the government is that we surrendered to become a part of the mainstream. But now most of our cadres have to make the rounds of courts fighting cases. I myself had four cases, of which three have been settled so far. But most of our colleagues find the process very frustrating and cant lead a normal life, he said.

	Midnapore, Nov. 7: Overzealous police have handed a victory to the Trinamul Congress on the first day of the chief ministers visit to the Maoist belt of West Midnapore.        
	The police were forced to release four college students who were arrested for waving black flags at the convoy of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee after Trinamuls women members marched right up to the gate of the circuit house where the chief minister is camping and sat on dharna.        
	At 4.40pm, as the chief ministers convoy swept into Midnapore town, a group of Trinamul students waved the black flags and asked him to go back.        
	Bhattacharjee is on a two-day visit to discuss development projects as well as development in the Maoist-affected districts of West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia.        
	The four youths were arrested on charges of obstructing a public servant and wrongful restraint. Calm prevailed after the arrest, probably because the police  4,000 personnel are on duty in the town since last night  had cordoned off a part of the road to the circuit house.        
	However, at 6.45pm, the cordon was withdrawn. Taking advantage of this, the Trinamul women activists reached the gate. Some CPM activists joined the fray, raising slogans in praise of the chief minister and berating the police for compromising his security.        
	With the situation threatening to spin out of control, the police agreed to free the four youths on bail. The women said the four should be brought from the police station to the circuit house gate and freed  a demand that was conceded.

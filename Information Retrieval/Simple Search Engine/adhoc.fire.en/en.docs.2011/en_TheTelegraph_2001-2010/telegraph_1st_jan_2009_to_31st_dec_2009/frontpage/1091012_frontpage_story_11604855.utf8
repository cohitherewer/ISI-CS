The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | PM returns Pakistans Baloch fusillade
                                                                                                           PM returns Pakistans Baloch fusillade
          OUR BUREAU AND PTI                            Manmohan Singh in Mumbai on Sunday. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, Oct. 11: Pakistan has alleged that India is arming militants in Balochistan, prompting Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to issue a blunt rebuttal laced with a swipe that the government and the people there jolly well knew the accusations are false.        
	The Prime Minister delivered the sharp response in Mumbai hours after Pakistans interior minister Rehman Malik claimed in Lahore that his government had asked the US administration to use its influence to stop India from allegedly interfering.        
	Without mentioning either Balochistan or India, Malik said: How can the militants get such heavy weapons? This can only be provided by one state.        
	However, in the next sentence, he referred to both. The Americans must make efforts to stop Indian intervention in Balochistan, Malik told a TV channel late last night.        
	Maliks comments were seen in Delhi as an attempt to raise the pitch in the event of India blaming Pakistan for the bomb attack on the embassy in Kabul. India has so far refrained from directly blaming Pakistan but has dropped hints that point at the usual suspect.        
	Prime Minister Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani mentioned that Pakistan has some information on threats in Balochistan and other areas, the joint statement of July 16 had said. India later clarified that it was a unilateral observation made by the Pakistani side.        
	Prime Minister Singhs unusually blunt reply is being interpreted as an effort to pre-empt the revival of the controversy over the joint statement in Sharm-el-Sheikh in Egypt. The statement made a mention of Balochistan for the first time in a bilateral statement, triggering a furore in India, in Parliament and outside.        
	Replying to a question on Maliks allegation, Singh said: This is entirely wrong. We are not in the business of spreading terror in Pakistan or in any other country. We are not in that business. And the government of Pakistan and the people will jolly well know that their accusations are false accusations.        
	The Prime Minister made an indirect reference to the terrorist attack on the Pakistan army headquarters, which had ended a few hours before he spoke, suggesting that the neighbour learn from its mistake of nurturing terror groups.        
	We have to make adequate preparations to deal with the consequences of this overflow of terrorism from the neighbourhood to our country. We are taking all necessary steps in that direction but it is still my belief that particularly Pakistan and the people and government of Pakistan should realise the great harm (that) patronisation of terror groups has done to the South Asian region, Singh said.        
	We need a neighbourhood of peace, friendliness and I will be the last one to say that, I think, if these conditions prevail (like) today in our neighbourhood in Pakistan and in Afghanistan, the situation is not what it should be.        
	Funds leak        
	The Prime Minister admitted leak of funds earmarked for development, but said it was not as big as was mentioned by Rajiv Gandhi.        
	Leak of funds earmarked for development does exist. But I do not admit that these leaks are as big as was mentioned by Rajivji, Singh told reporters.        
	Former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, during a visit to the drought-affected Kalahandi in Orissa in 1985, had said: Of every rupee spent by the government, only 17 paise reached the intended beneficiary.         
	Last year, Rahul Gandhi had said even five paise of a rupee spent by the Centre was not reaching the intended beneficiaries.

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Guwahati, Aug. 9: An inter-state alert has been issued a day after the abduction of an engineer of the Northeast Frontier Railway as police, grappling for clues, picked up more than 20 people for interrogation since last night.         
	Suspected militants of the Ranjan Daimary faction of the NDFB abducted Sanjay Kumar Lama yesterday around noon near Batasipara close to Dhekiajuli station in Sonitpur district where he had gone to supervise a rail bridge repair.         
	A massive rescue operation had been launched in Sonitpur, its adjoining districts and neighbouring Arunachal Pradesh with the help of the army and the Assam Rifles, police sources said.         
	So far no group has either claimed responsibility for the abduction or demanded ransom.        
	The police, quoting eyewitnesses, said four youths were involved in Lamas abduction.         
	Twenty-one people had been picked up from Batasipara under Dhekiajuli police station for interrogation since last night but no lead could be obtained, Dhekiajuli police said.         
	The chief public relations officer of the NFR, S. Hajong, confirmed that no ransom had been demanded for Lamas release.        
	Hajong said the NFR was keenly following the development and was in constant touch with the security forces to ensure the safe release of its employee.         
	The superintendent of police, Sonitpur, Surinder Kumar, told this correspondent over phone that a massive rescue operation had been launched since last night by the police with the help of the army and the Assam Rifles to secure Lamas safe release.         
	He, however, refused to divulge details on ground of secrecy of operations.         
	As of now I can say we are on the job and all efforts are being made to rescue the hostage, Kumar said.         
	Other police sources said the police and security forces in Arunachal Pradesh too were alerted and the border with the neighbouring state had been sealed.         
	The NDFB militants often take shelter in the dense forests of Arunachal Pradesh. Search operations were also continuing in Udalguri and Darrang districts, police sources said.         
	On Friday evening, suspected NDFB militants abducted Subhas Das, an employee of a grocery shop in the remote Rakshakmari area under Dhekiajuli police station bordering Arunachal Pradesh.         
	 Col S.M. Perumal and his driver were killed when the NDFB rebels blew off their vehicle in Sonitpur recently. The outfit has intensified its activities in the district where the armys 4 corps is deployed.

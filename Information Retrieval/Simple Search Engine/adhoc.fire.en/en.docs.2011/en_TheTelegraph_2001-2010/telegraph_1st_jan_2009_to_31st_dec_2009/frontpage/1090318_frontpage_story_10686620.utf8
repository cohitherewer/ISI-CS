  - UP replay in Bihar, some see strategy          NISHIT DHOLABHAI AND NALIN VERMA                             Lalu Prasad, Sonia Gandhi                                       
	New Delhi/Patna, March 17: UPA allies Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan have worked out a sweet seat-sharing deal in Bihar but left the Congress flaming with a paltry share of three in the states 40 Lok Sabha seats.         
	The Congress was quick to rebuff the arrangement as unfair and made it clear that it would contest as many as we like.         
	Much like Uttar Pradesh, where the field is likely to be replete with friendly fights against the Samajwadi Party, Sonia Gandhis party has been left by allies to fend for itself in Bihar.         
	Aware that the deal would leave the Congress not only upset but also suspicious over their post-poll intentions, both Lalu Prasad and Paswan were at pains to underline their commitment to the UPA at a joint news conference this morning.         
	There are no differences in the UPA, we are part of it and we will remain part of it. We shall have no truck with others, Lalu Prasad asserted.         
	Lalu Prasads RJD will contest 25 seats and Paswans LJP 12 as part of the deal, which leaves open the prospect of UPA allies indulging in friendly fights in a large number of constituencies.         
	It is of little comfort to UPA partners in Bihar that the Lalu Prasad-Paswan announcement stirred an immediate rebellion within the ranks led by Lalu Prasads stormy brother-in-law Sadhu Yadav.         
	Denied a ticket because his Gopalganj constituency has become a reserved seat after delimitation, Sadhu threatened to contest from both East and West Champaran, seats that have gone to the LJP.         
	Sadhu found support from other disgruntled RJD leaders like Ramai Ram, Jainarain Nishad and Pappu Yadav. All of them went to lobby support with the Congress general secretary in charge of Bihar, Sushil Kumar Shinde.         
	All but Pappu went on record to say that the RJD was not doing social justice and they would contest from various seats either on their own or under some other partys banner.         
	Lalu Prasad avoided answers to questions on why the Congress was absent from todays united show of strength where he and Paswan repeatedly embraced for photographers.         
	The RJD chief made it clear that it was the Congress which had offered the theory of not having a national alliance and only sharing seats in states if possible. Paswan pleaded ignorance, arguing it was up to the RJD as a bigger partner to have decided on co-opting the Congress.         
	Some Congress leaders in Patna, however, are putting the veneer of deeper strategy on the short shrift handed to the party.                    
	They argue that the agreement brings to the fore a tacit understanding among the Congress, LJP and the RJD to win maximum seats for the UPA  the Congress will engage in friendly fights mainly on seats dominated by upper castes and minorities in order to wean crucial votes away from the Nitish Kumar-led JD(U)-BJP alliance.         
	Their calculation, they say, is simple. The Congress will field its candidates on over 16 more seats which have predominantly Muslims and upper castes voters with BJP nominees on most of these seats. In case they fail to emerge clear winners, the Congress candidates will surely cut into the upper castes and Muslim votes causing damage to the BJP-led NDA on such seats, said a senior Congress leader.         
	The anger of Congress leaders at the unilateral announcement by Lalu Prasad and Paswan, however, did not offer any hint that the party was in on the deal and was merely playing its part of the strategy.

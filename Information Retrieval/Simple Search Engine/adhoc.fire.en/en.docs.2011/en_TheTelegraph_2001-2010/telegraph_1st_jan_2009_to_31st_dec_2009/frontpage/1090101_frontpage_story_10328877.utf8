The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Engineer R dares to belong
                                                                                                           Engineer R dares to belong
  - Kashmir candidate who swam against tide and won          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                            Rasheed in Langate. (Sankarshan Thakur)                                        
	Langate (North Kashmir), Dec. 31: He flung a simple notion into Kashmirs fiery crucible, all too aware that it could get charred to cinders in its volatile swirl. To a people torn between such high-voltage choices as aazaadi and self-governance, bullet and ballot, he merely decided to say: I belong to you. No party, no flags, no manifesto, not even a promise beyond the lofty simplicity of I belong to you.         
	They bought the line. Against all the highfalutin of the formidable boycott brigade in north Kashmir. Against all the power and resources of parties like the National Conference, PDP and the Congress. Against all public forecast and personal foreboding.         
	On December 28, Abdul Rasheed, known to his constituents as Engineer Rasheed, became the only member of the new Jammu and Kashmir Assembly to have got there throwing a dare rather than offering lure.         
	Zurrat logon ko karni thhi. (The people had to have the courage.) I had no means to make promises to people and my big opponents had not left any promises in the book for me to make anyhow. All I could tell them was, I am with them. They took the challenge and now victory is theirs, not mine, he says, his grin baring an eroded set of teeth but at once lighting up a face worn well beyond his 38 years.         
	Nobody gave me a chance, but perhaps they didnt reckon with the people. I challenged them to begin with, now their hopes have become my challenge.         
	He hasnt had time to get used to the trappings that have suddenly descended on him  the honorific of MLA, half a dozen gunmen, a crowd milling in the wood-and-mud two-storey house he inhabits in the remote hamlet of Qaziabad, a journalist taking notes and flashing a camera that has left him over-conscious. Every time it clicks, he halts mid-sentence.         
	Keep that thing to the side for a bit please, it makes me nervous. Its a coy protest, made in broken English and a rough-hewn Urdu; hes most comfortable speaking Kashmiri but thats no good with his visitor.         
	Village elders and mates sitting circled on the wooden floor around him  my council of people, he calls them  laugh at the discomfiture of their hero, the policemen are merely amused by the novice antics of the VIP theyve been tasked to protect; theyve probably never seen a camera-shy neta.         
	But Engineer Rasheed may be a man of more courage and conviction than a flashbulb can daunt. Two days before he decided to file his nomination papers, he was still an anonymous civil engineer in the state governments employ. Two days before he took the most important decision of his life, he was yet to fight the most critical battle on the way to getting there  he had still not confronted his mentor and separatist leader Sajjad Lone of the Peoples Conference.         
	I was convinced people needed to be represented, there are higher battles to be fought but there are our daily battles too, of poverty and deprivation and need, I had to part ways with Sajjadsaheb.         
	He isnt quite sure when the penny of revolt dropped in his head, but contesting elections has subconsciously been in the works for a while. A couple of years ago, he donated an acre of ancestral land to a primary school project. Then, he began launching rhetorical attacks on separatists like Syed Ali Shah Geelani in the Srinagar press; the unknown Engineers pieces got immediate notice. But he was still to emerge from the shadows of Lone.         
	It eventually became an angry scene with him and the rest of the party. But faith and fervour gave the Engineer the guts he needed to get up and call his leader wrong. I quit there and then, in all humility and sadness, but I believed they were wrong and I was right, people need representation, nobody needs to ask why.         
	Langate, a near-arid rural stretch wedged between Kupwara and Baramulla, is not unlike other victims of protracted political and administrative dereliction in other parts of the country  a cold, mud-caked scar that has only ever been fed unkept promises. It is perhaps metaphoric enough that Langates sheep are better clad than its children this harsh winter.         
	Aap dekhiye yahan logon ke paas kya hai, Engineer Rasheed says, roving his eye round the bereft village square. Waise mere paas bhi kuchh nahin, ummeed ke siva. (You can see for yourself what people have here. By the way, I dont have too much either, other than hope.)         
	He withdrew Rs 5,000 from his lifetime savings of Rs 60,000 to file his papers and then pulled all of that money out to put into his campaign. But that sum was gone even before he could begin to count on it, so he went to the people.         
	Maine woh Barack Obama ke baare mein suna thha, kaise usne paisa jama kiya, maine socha try karke dekhen. (I had heard about that Barack Obama, how he raised money bit by bit, I thought lets give it a shot.)         
	By the time he was into his second week of campaigning, Engineer Rasheeds coffers were filling up with fivers and tenners, the odd hundred-rupee note, too. I had no means to run this campaign, looking back I think it was a totally mad decision to contest. But then, as I went around talking to people, something happened and the money came.         
	The father of three then adds with a mischievous wink: I have even begun telling them they have to raise the Rs 60,000 I gave out of my personal savings and return to me. If I am working for them, why should I be using up my own savings, my family has needs too.         
	For the moment though, the man who many have begun to call Kashmirs Obama, must begin to confront the burden of his peoples needs. Its huge and his prematurely balded head has a fair measure of it. Gadbad kiya to log maarenge, unhe haq hai. (If I commit mistakes, people will beat me up, they would have every right to.)

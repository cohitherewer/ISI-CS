The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Not everyone needs to wear masks: Govt
                                                                                                           Not everyone needs to wear masks: Govt
          OUR BUREAU                      Unscientific: Bikers wear masks. (PTI)                          
	New Delhi, Aug. 13: Facemasks may prevent the spread of flu within an infected household, but wearing them in public spaces is unscientific, health officials said today, asking people to stifle an emerging frenzy over facemasks.         
	The public demand for facemasks has spiked across several Indian cities in recent weeks as the footprint of the H1N1 flu has expanded in the country. The death toll touched 22 today.        
	The facemasks issue emerged at a cabinet meeting where, sources said, one minister asked for a clear message from the government saying there was no need for panic and no need to chase masks.        
	Senior health officials this evening issued an advisory. Masks are for patients and their caregivers, said Rakesh Srivastava, the director-general of health services. They are also needed by doctors and hospital and laboratory staff who handle patients and test samples, he said.        
	A person riding a scooter does not need a mask, he said. This is unscientific.        
	Research released earlier this month suggests that the use of facemasks combined with hand-washing hygiene can reduce the spread of the flu virus in a household if practised within 36 hours of flu symptoms appearing in the first patient at home. But the study could not determine which of the two interventions  facemasks or hand-washing  was more important.        
	Experts also caution that while facemasks are available in different layers or thickness, they are not ideal protection against viruses. A US Food and Drug Administration document says a facemask does not filter or block very small particles in the air that may be transmitted by coughs or sneezes.        
	The US FDA document says a respiratory protective device  the N95 respirator  is designed to prevent a person from breathing in even very small particles in the air. The 95 denotes that in tests, it was able to block 95 per cent of very small test particles but, the US FDA cautions, even N95 cannot completely eliminate the risk of illness.        
	An official at the National Institute of Communicable Diseases said respiratory etiquette  covering coughs and sneezes with tissue paper or hands  and frequent hand-washing with soap are key messages for the public.        
	People should avoid touching their eyes, nose, mouth with their hands, the official said. Caregivers in a household should also try and stay at least six feet or farther away from an infected person.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Presidency freedom collective decision
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Presidency freedom collective decision
          OUR BUREAU                             Presidency College                                  
	Calcutta, Dec. 6: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee may have tried to earn brownie points by trying to free Presidency College from CPM shackles but the party is now busy doing damage control having annoyed one of its key constituents  college and university teachers.         
	Realising that the decision has left a section of the West Bengal College and University Teachers Association (WBCUTA) unhappy, higher education minister Sudarshan Ray Chaudhuri tried to offer a justification today. The decision wasnt taken overnight. We have gone about the autonomy issue step by step and it was done after weighing all options. We didnt decide it in a hurry, said the minister, a former leader of the teachers body with over 9,000 members.         
	Former CPM state secretary Anil Biswas, who had wielded near-absolute power in the WBCUTA, was against Presidencys autonomy. The committee appointed by the government in 2006 to decide on the colleges future, is also known to have voted against autonomy under WBCUTA pressure.         
	But the situation has changed since. While only a small section of academics was clamouring for Presidencys autonomy in 2006, the number of people pushing for it swelled and, in 2009, Mamata Banerjee threw her hat into the ring.         
	Many believe Bhattacharjee fast-tracked Presidencys unitary university status after Mamata wondered at The Telegraph-Calcutta Club National Debate on November 7 why the Left government could not do so in over three decades.        
	However, to smoothen ruffled feathers, Ray Chaudhuri tried to tell the teachers that the decision was not the chief ministers alone. The decision to allow unitary university status to Presidency College was collective. Individual preferences were not considered, said the minister, who spent 20 minutes justifying the move in his 45-minute speech.         
	According to a WBCUTA member, Ray Chaudhuris emphasis on autonomy and collective decision was an attempt to bridge divisions. With the party trying to regroup ahead of the Assembly polls under Bhattacharjees leadership, it does not want a split in the teachers lobby, where Trinamul has already made inroads.         
	By calling it a collective decision, he is trying to send out a signal that the party has rallied around the chief minister on this. Now, he wants us to fall in line, he explained.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Indians are Americas best friends in world
                                                                                                           Indians are Americas best friends in world
          REUTERS AND OUR BUREAU                                              
	Jan. 18: A poll has revealed that India and Poland are the only two countries with major economies, apart from America itself, that view the US favourably.        
	Indias score of 72  the percentage of its people who approve of America  leaves Poland (53) far behind and runs the US (74) close.        
	India was the lone country other than the US where a majority said America does contribute to international peace and co-operation.        
	The findings were made public ahead of Barack Obamas inauguration. But the online survey was conducted in late November after Obamas election, which makes it difficult to conclude whether the results endorse Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs statement to George W. Bush in September that the people of India deeply love you.        
	If the Prime Minister, as the head of the government, meant that India as a nation loves the US as another country, which happened to be represented by Bush then, the poll results do vindicate Singh.        
	But the outcome cannot be delinked entirely from Bush. Although his presidency had slipped into the lame-duck phase in November, the opinions reflected would have had a lot to do with his policies, with the US drawing the harshest criticism in the survey for its foreign policy.        
	The findings come at a time India is witnessing a burst of political incorrectness, with some industrialists hailing the riot-tainted Narendra Modi as a model.        
	The poll was conducted on behalf of Reuters by Ipsos Global Public Affairs, a market research and polling company. It surveyed 22,000 people from 22 countries that account for 75 per cent of the worlds GDP.        
	Although Reuters said that only in India and Poland did a majority back America, it added that pro-US respondents outnumbered anti-US ones in six other countries. It did not clarify whether a large number of dont knows kept the America backers under 50 per cent in these six.        
	It was a tie in Britain and South Korea. Israel was not surveyed; nor was any Muslim nation other than Turkey.        
	Asked what they thought was important for a country to be respected, most respondents put human rights at No. 1, followed by citizens rights and contribution to international peace.        
	The US standard of living  the probable reason for a steady flow of immigrants even from the America-bashing countries  and contribution to the global economy drew good reviews, but those surveyed ranked those values far lower in importance.

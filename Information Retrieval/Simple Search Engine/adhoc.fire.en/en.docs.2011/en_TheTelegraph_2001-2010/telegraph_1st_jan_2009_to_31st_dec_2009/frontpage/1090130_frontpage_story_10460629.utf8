          OUR BUREAU                                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 29: Calcutta has benefited the least from last nights fuel price cut because the Left Front government had already activated an unpublicised plan to roll back a concession it had granted last year.        
	The Centre last night reduced the prices of petrol by Rs 5 and diesel by Rs 2 a litre but in Calcutta, the cut translated into only Rs 3.11 and 71 paise, respectively. In all the other metros, the reduction ranged from Rs 5 to Rs 5.42 for petrol and Rs 2 to Rs 2.24 for diesel.         
	The Calcutta damper occurred because the Bengal government decided to revert to sales tax rates that prevailed before June 2008. This means consumers in Calcutta will lose Rs 1.89 out of the Rs 5 reduction offered by the Centre on each litre of petrol. Similarly, diesel buyers stand to lose Rs 1.29 from the Rs 2 concession on every litre.        
	On June 4 when the Centre had raised prices, the Left government had cut the sales tax on petrol and diesel in a magnanimous gesture to lessen the peoples burden.        
	The June 4 price increase had triggered a flurry of activity in full public view with the CPM and the Trinamul Congress announcing bandhs within hours of the central decision and state finance minister Asim Dasgupta proclaiming the relief by the evening.        
	This time, the state government chose to act away from the public eye and through proper channel. Anticipating a central price concession, the state government informed oil companies as early as January 14 that the sales tax would be readjusted the moment a fresh reduction kicked in.        
	Unlike last time when it shouted the good news from the Writers rooftop, the state government did not find it necessary to tell anyone else, especially those who buy petrol and diesel, the bad news till this afternoon.        
	The result was frayed nerves and brawls at several petrol outlets where customers confronted dealers for not passing on the full relief of Rs 5 and Rs 2.        
	The finance minister should have made us and the public know that his government had decided some time back that it would go back to the original sales tax rates. Our dealers were harassed throughout the day because of the confusion, Tushar Sen, the West Bengal Petroleum Dealers Association president, said.        
	Asked why the government did not make the decision public, finance minister Dasgupta said: I am told there was some inconvenience to oil dealers because of a little bit of confusion about the revised rates. But the government had nothing to hide. Our estimated revenue loss in the current financial year (from the earlier relief) was Rs 480 crore. With yesterdays fall in prices, we had no option but to revert to the rates.        
	Maharashtra and Left-ruled Kerala, which too had cut tax rates last June, have passed on to consumers the full benefit of the latest cut.

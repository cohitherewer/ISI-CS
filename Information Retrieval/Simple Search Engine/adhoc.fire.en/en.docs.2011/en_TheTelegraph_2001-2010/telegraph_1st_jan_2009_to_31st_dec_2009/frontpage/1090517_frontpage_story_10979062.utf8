The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | 2 winners, 2 losers   Mrs G amp; Mrs G: same score 
                                                                                                           2 winners, 2 losers     Mrs G amp; Mrs G: same score 
          RASHEED KIDWAI                            Indira Gandhi                                        
	New Delhi, May 16: The original Mrs G delivered a second successive election victory for the Congress but before that she had to win a war in 1971. The reigning Mrs G has also led the Congress to a consecutive poll success but hasnt had to go so far as to fight an external war, though there might have been many domestic battles.        
	At least on one count, Mrs G equals Mrs G. Both have now won elections back to back. Indira Gandhi never won a third one running.        
	Given the culture of worship in the Congress, no one would openly weigh Field Marshal Sonia against Indira but comparisons are inevitable if only because they share the name. And if only because theyre both women leading the countrys oldest party in circumstances very different but also similar in that each has had to skipper the ship in stormy waters.        
	Sonia considers Indira to be her role model with whom comparisons are by definition not possible. But her style is also sharply different from that of the late Prime Minister who was not known to be democratic in the way she ran the party.        
	Since 1998, when she was a reluctant entrant into politics, Sonia has been anything but a control freak, a term often used for the Congress high command under her mother-in-law. With the exception of J.B. Patnaik in Orissa and Vilasrao Deshmukh in Maharashtra, Congress chief ministers have seldom been shunted out by Sonia.        
	Even her core team, consisting of Ahmed Patel, Oscar Fernandes, Janardhan Dwivedi, Digvijay Singh and Ambika Soni, has remained intact with minor fluctuations. Unlike in Indiras days, the team of advisers has not grown into a cabal at whose feet the party and the nation have to worship.        
	Sonias respect for regional leaders like Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, Sheila Dikshit, Bhoopinder Singh Hooda, Ashok Gehlot and other chief ministers has resulted in the Congress consolidating its gains in Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana and Rajasthan.         
	Some Congress leaders find Sonias task of reviving the party more daunting than in the Indira era when there were no powerful regional parties to battle, nor any compulsions of coalition politics.         
	For most part of her tenure, Indiras Congress had a strong social base of Brahmins, Dalits and minorities and her standing among the scheduled tribes was unchallenged. Once she had established her authority after the Congress split, Indira didnt have to worry about winning elections until she lost her head and declared Emergency.        
	Sonia, on the contrary, had everything going against her when she took charge with the BJP growing in power. Congress leaders refer to Sonias own 1998 remark that she was not Jawaharlal Nehrus daughter to illustrate the difficulties she had to face till 2004 when she led the party to power. She had said that when Sharad Pawar, P.A. Sangma and Tariq Anwar had raised the issue of her foreign origin.        
	When power was waiting at the door of 10 Janpath, she made Manmohan Singh the Prime Minister, a step which might not have been expected of Indira who in her time did not allow what she considered parallel centres of power to develop. For five years, Sonia tried to stay in the background while Singh ran the country amid loud whispers of conflict that never developed into anything serious.        
	Now, another election has been won  and with such flourish, too, with the Congress rediscovering its national character by stamping its presence again in Uttar Pradesh and taking its tally beyond 200 to general amazement. Ten years ago, when she took the helm, the doubt was if it would push past half that number.         
	Congress leaders said the grooming of the heir apparent, meaning Rahul, is also being done in contrasting fashion. Indiras critics said she had given Sanjay too much power too quickly and, to a lesser extent, to Rajiv, too.         
	Rahuls climb has been slow and steady. Before this election, he was only an MP with a famous surname who led the partys babalog. He was not made a minister, nor given a disproportionately large role in the party set-up.         
	Now that he has proved his worth  the implications of the partys stunning Uttar Pradesh comeback possibly going farther than anything else that has happened this election  no one will question Rahul earning a large reward in government or in the party or both.        
	The current Mrs G has done many things differently from her larger-than-life predecessor. But, since numbers are what decide polls, the winner of Mrs G vs Mrs G can be called with certainty only in 2014 if Sonia can deliver a 3-2 score by winning three consecutive elections.

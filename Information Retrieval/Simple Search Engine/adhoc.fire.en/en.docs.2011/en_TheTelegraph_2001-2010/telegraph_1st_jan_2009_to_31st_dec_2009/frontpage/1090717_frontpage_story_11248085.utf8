                                                                                                           Dada becomes Fellow
          AMIT ROY                            Sourav (extreme left) at the university ground                                  
	London, July 16: Sourav Ganguly was yesterday awarded an honorary fellowship, the equivalent of an honorary degree, for his contribution to the world of cricket by the University of Central Lancashire which wants to strengthen its links with India.        
	 The former Indian captain, who has a local link because he played county cricket for a season with Lancashire nine summers ago, was honoured at the convocation in the Guildhall in Preston watched by 2,000 parents and students who had come for their own graduation ceremony.        
	 The university said that Sourav, now 37 and on the threshold of a new direction in his life, is acknowledged as Indias most successful cricket captain, having led the side in 49 Test matches which included 21 Test wins.        
	 After the formal part of the ceremony, university officials had a bit of fun by ushering the more than willing Sourav into the Preston Sports Arena, the universitys multi-million pound sports complex. There, dressed in gown and mortar board, he posed for photographs with a bat while the academic staff lined up in the slips.         
	Commenting on the fellowship, John Minten, head of the universitys School of Sport, Tourism and The Outdoors said Souravs distinguished international career and his reputation for having played cricket with such commitment and tenacity would be of great inspiration to Lancashire students.         
	Our students and staff take great pride in their association with honorary fellows and were delighted that Sourav has accepted our Honorary Fellowship, Minten said.         
	The award also reflects our excellent reputation for sport-related courses and research, which includes new, cricket-related programmes, and a growing collaboration with partner educational institutions in India, Minten added.         
	In his response, Sourav today told The Telegraph: I thanked everyone, I spoke about my time in Lancashire. My first One Day International was at Old Trafford (the home of the Lancashire County Cricket Club) which was a coincidence.        
	He was not intimidated by having to get up before a huge academic gathering in an unfamiliar setting. I feel good, its a new experience, I feel good about it. Khoob bhallo legeche, students der sathe (I liked being with the students very much). I felt very comfortable. This is my first honorary degree in the UK.        
	He is now in the process of establishing the Wissen (its a German word  it means knowledge) International School in Salt Lake in Calcutta, with an adjoining college of the same name. The school will begin next year and the college in a year or two.        
	He had received an email from the university asking him he would accept the fellowship earlier this year. He had responded positively.        
	The university had earlier pointed out in a statement: Sourav has set up his own cricket academy in Calcutta and the economically underprivileged with talent are given priority. He is also in the process of setting up a school and a college, which will be linked to sports facilities making a unique contribution to Bengali society as no such facility exists in the state. He is actively associated with raising funds for NGOs and uses his fame in creating awareness about social problems that continue to plague contemporary Bengal. Sourav, who is a deeply religious person, is married to Dona and they have a daughter Sana.        
	As to whether he would have time to attend university functions in the future, Sourav today promised: Of course, I will.        
	Souravs candidacy was proposed in January this year by a member of the universitys staff, Boria Majumdar, a senior research fellow in Mintens department.        
	Majumdar explained that the university was looking for someone of sufficient stature in India who could represent Lancashires growing links with the country.        
	The University of Central Lancashire (UCLan), which was formed in 1992, now has 35, 000 students, including 350 international Indian students. The latter study in India for two years under a franchise programme and come to Lancashire for their final year.        
	A further 1,100 students are Indian origin students resident in the UK.        
	Lancashire has been working in partnership with Padmashree Dr D.Y. Patil University for 10 years teaching Biomedical Sciences and Molecular and Cellular Biology. From September 2009 it will work in partnership with Manav Rachna Educational University to offer franchised programmes in Digital Design for Fashion as well as Business Administration.         
	The university has also signed a partnership with the IMS Design and Innovation Academy to offer Fashion and Brand Promotion.        
	Majumdar said he could have gone for someone like Sachin Tendulkar but Souravs links meant he just fell into place. Only once before has a cricketer been honoured  that was (the former West Indian captain) Clive Lloyd in 1986.        
	Majumdar had to submit a formal proposal, setting out the reasons for his submission, which was scrutinised by the universitys academic board and then considered and ratified by Professor Malcolm McVicar, Lancashires Vice Chancellor.        
	The university accepted Majumdars view that Sourav stood tall  he has been an icon who has inspired cricketers not only in India but across the world.        
	Dharma Kovvuri, Lancashires acting dean of its management faculty, confirmed that the university wanted to build on its relationship with India. Its a great honour for the university that we have been able to nominate Sourav and its great he has accepted. He has been a great ambassador for Indian cricket and as we all know, he has been the most successful Indian cricket captain and for him to accept the award from the university is a great honour for us.        
	 The Lancashire Evening Post has described Sourav as Indias equivalent of David Beckham  a sports superstar who achieved greatness by scoring more than 11,000 runs in one-day cricket and captaining his nation to a record 21 Test victories.        
	But despite all the staggering sporting honours and successes, it is Sourav Gangulys latest achievement has brought him special pride.        
	Sourav told the paper: It is a huge honour. When I came to know about this a few months ago, I felt proud and Im happy to be here. I have a long-term association with Lancashire  I had my first one-day international at Old Trafford 13 years ago and had a stint with Lancashire County Cricket Club.        
	 Sourav also recalled: The best thing I remember about Lancashire was in April 2000 when I turned up with the temperature being 10 degrees. I was standing in the slips and couldnt take my hands out of my pockets as it was so cold. Luckily, Michael Atherton asked me to go at mid-on where I put some hand warmers in my pockets and kept myself warm.        
	Sourav was a cricket legend, the paper said.

  - Govt asks watchdog to raise limit        CITHARA PAUL                                                    
	New Delhi, Nov. 12: The Centre has asked the insurance watchdog to raise the upper age limit for health policies and ensure that senior citizens are not scared off by huge premiums.        
	The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) has been advised to lift the age limit from 65 to 70. The directive is non-binding but such advisories are usually not rejected unless a valid reason can be cited.        
	Most insurers are now reluctant to issue new health policies to those aged above 50-55, and the policies of those who purchased them at a younger age usually lose validity once they reach 65.        
	The state-owned National Insurance Company is a rare  if not the sole  insurer that now offers new health policies to people between the age of 60 and 70 under its Baristha Bima scheme. These policies remain valid till the policy holders turn 80.         
	A panel set up by the insurance authority had last year recommended the issuance of medical insurance policies till 65, and validity till 75-80, but so far the IRDA has not acted.        
	The central proposal, made by the social justice ministry, scales down the limit proposed by the panel  perhaps offering leeway to the watchdog to accept the advisory.        
	If the insurance authority raises the upper age limit from 65 to 70, it will apply to all insurers, government-run or private. The ministry recommendation relates only to the age limit till when policies should remain valid; it does not say till what age new policies should be issued.        
	An official of the Union social justice ministry said: We have asked the IRDA to raise the age bar. The National Council for Older Persons (NCOP) wanted the bar raised to 75, but the ministry and the IRDA have agreed on 70. The claim could not be confirmed independently with the IRDA.        
	The government feels that the current age limit is not realistic since there has been a sharp increase in longevity. The average life expectancy in India was 64.7 in 2007, up from 62.5 in 2000 and 59 in 1990.        
	The ministry has also asked the IRDA to put a stop to insurers charging senior citizens exorbitant amounts as premiums.         
	Once you are on the wrong side of 50, it is very difficult to get health insurance. Either the insurance company will flatly deny you insurance or it will charge very high premium so that you will back off, said K. Jacob Roy, a member of the NCOP, a body under the social justice ministry that is in charge of framing policies related to the elderly.        
	The ministry official said the directive was conveyed to the insurance authority in end-October at the NCOPs annual meeting. The IRDA was told that no insurance company should be allowed to deny health cover to a senior citizen who is under 70 without officially citing the reasons and furnishing documents. The IRDA has also been asked to ensure that senior citizens are not denied overseas mediclaim cover, the official said.        
	An NCOP suggestion had earlier prompted the finance ministry to make the Senior Citizens Savings Scheme more flexible by allowing depositors to transfer accounts from post offices to banks, and the other way round, without any strings attached. Till then, such transfers were possible only if the depositor had changed his residence.

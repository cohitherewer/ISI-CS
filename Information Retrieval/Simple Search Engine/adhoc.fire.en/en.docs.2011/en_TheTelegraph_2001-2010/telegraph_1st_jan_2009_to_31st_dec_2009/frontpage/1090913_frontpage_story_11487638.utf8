The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Assam offers land to IT majors
                                                                                                           Assam offers land to IT majors
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Guwahati, Sept. 12: The Assam government today offered 100 acres of land each to IT giants Infosys and Wipro to execute projects that were shelved in West Bengal.        
	State information technology minister Himanta Biswa Sarma told reporters here that the government was ready to give 100 acres of land each to the two companies to set up IT hubs in the state capital.        
	Since the Bengal government has rejected the projects of both companies due to land problems, Assam, being a neighbouring state, welcomes the firms. A high-level delegation of the state government will travel to Bangalore next week to meet the top brass of Infosys and Wipro, Sarma said.         
	The delegation will be led by IT commissioner V.S. Bhaskar.        
	He said the government had identified the plots of land situated along the national highway, close to the Lokapriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport at Borjhar.        
	The ministers offer comes within days of farmers rising in protest against the state governments move to acquire farmland on the outskirts of the city for a project by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).        
	Sarma said the government had already acquired 100 acres and was in the process of acquiring the remaining 100 acres. He, however, did not say whether the plots would be contiguous.        
	The state government has already acquired 100 acres of land near LGB International Airport for an IT park. We are going to acquire another 100 acres soon. If Wipro and Infosys come to the state, the government will go the extra mile to provide all kinds of support to them to successfully execute the project, the minister added.        
	Chief minister Tarun Gogoi had been wooing IT stalwarts like S. Ramadorai of Tata Consultancy Services, N.R. Narayana Murthy of Infosys and Azim Premji of Wipro, to the state, over the past few years.        
	 Murthy, however, had categorically told Gogoi that unless a five-star hotel was set up in the city, the chances of IT companies coming to the state were bleak. Two five-star hotels will also be ready in the city by the time the IT companies complete their project. Power supply will not be a problem and captive power stations will be created for the IT projects, Sarma revealed.        
	The minister said he would also go to Bangalore to meet Murthy and Premji next month to convince them.                    
	and impress upon them about Assam being the right destination for a major investment in IT.         
	Our new IT policy is focused on making Assam a strong case for potential investors as their new destination. The policy is packed with strong investment promotion clauses. The IT policy was finalised and drafted after extensive discussions with Ramadorai, Murthy and Premji. We are confident that Murthy and Premji will reciprocate positively to the Assam governments invitation, Sarma added.

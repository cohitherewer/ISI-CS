The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Upset Two: Lalit loses in Rajasthan
                                                                                                           Upset Two: Lalit loses in Rajasthan
          RAKHEE ROY TALUKDAR                              
	Jaipur, March 1: Indian Premier League boss Lalit Modi was bearded in his den today, losing by five votes the election for Rajasthan Cricket Association president, a post he had held since 2005.        
	The high-profile Modi blamed the defeat, a blow to his rising stature in the national board, on the alleged machinations of the states Rajasthan government and insisted he would stay on as IPL chairman and commissioner.        
	My loss has nothing to do with the IPL (and will not) affect my standing in it. The RCA and the IPL are two entirely different things, Modi said after the defeat by Sanjay Dixit, fielded by his rival and outgoing secretary Subhash Joshis camp.        
	This is technically true since the IPL is run by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), where Modi is a vice-president. His term as IPL boss runs till 2013, and as board vice-president till 2011. But many in the cricket community believe Modi should step down as IPL chief on moral grounds.        
	BCCI chief Shashank Manohar, however, asserted that Modis position in the board and the IPL would not be affected, a PTI report said. Modi also holds a vice-presidents post in the Punjab Cricket Association.        
	I paid the price of being close to (former BJP chief minister) Vasundhara Raje. The state government did whatever it could to defeat me, Modi, entangled in fraud cases and contract probes since the Congress came to power late last year, said.        
	He said he was disappointed but denied the election was a prestige battle.        
	Modi said the Rajasthan Royals home matches would continue to be played in Jaipur when the next IPL season starts in April. He had earlier threatened to pull the games out of the city in retaliation to the politically motivated cases against him.        
	Modi lost 13-18 to Dixit, an IAS officer who heads the state tennis association and the Barmer district cricket association. Modi loyalist Ameen Pathan lost the election for secretary 12-19 to Ashok Kumar Ohri, the Churu district cricket chief.        
	The state has 32 district associations but the vote of Sriganganagar, a Modi backer, was put in a sealed envelope on a decision by the Supreme Court, which is hearing a case against the district body.        
	Joshi had yesterday withdrawn his candidature for president, paving the way for Dixit, a Modi loyalist turned critic, to contest. Sources said Joshi had been promised a BCCI post as Rajasthans representative. Whatever has happened has been for the good of cricket. Yes, I am going to the BCCI, Joshi said after the victory.        
	Dixit alleged that Modi gave him a life-threatening warning this morning and had tried to bribe voters. He has lodged a police complaint.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, March 20: The Meghalaya unit of the NCP will open dialogues with all the non-Congress parties in the Northeast on Sunday and the MPA will file a petition in the Supreme Court against the imposition of Presidents rule in the state on Monday.        
	The NCP leaders will meet the AUDF, the AGP, the BJP and the BPPF in Guwahati, NCP state unit president P.A. Sangma said here today.        
	He claimed there was tremendous anger against the Congress for recommending Presidents rule, so much so that party workers want to fight the Lok Sabha polls on the cowdung symbol instead of the NCPs. Unfortunately there is no cowdung symbol on the list, he quipped.        
	Sources said NCP workers in Meghalaya even told Sangma to ask the partys national president, Sharad Pawar, why he attended the cabinet meeting that decided on Presidents rule.        
	An MPA delegation, led by Sangma, rushed to Delhi yesterday to meet various party leaders to garner support against the imposition of Presidents rule in the state.         
	Today, Sangma and his team called on Opposition leader L.K. Advani and CPM general secretary Prakash Karat.        
	Sangma said Advani assured the NCP of his partys support. Advaniji said the Northeast unit of the BJP will be with us in the agitation against the Presidents rule in the state.

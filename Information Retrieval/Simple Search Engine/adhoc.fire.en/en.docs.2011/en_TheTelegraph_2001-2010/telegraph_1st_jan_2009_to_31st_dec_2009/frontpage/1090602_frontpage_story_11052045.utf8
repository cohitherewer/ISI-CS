The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Why CM had to face the backlash
                                                                                                           Why CM had to face the backlash
          ZEESHAN JAWED                                               
	Gosaba, June 1: A kilometre-long corridor paved with little else other than red tape conspired with other attendant ills symptomatic of the Bengal administrations decay to saddle the chief minister with his worst day in office on Sunday.        
	Lethargy, red tape, poor or non-existent infrastructure and lack of officers capable of taking rapid-fire decisions in the face of a crisis  you name it and Gosaba has seen it after Cyclone Aila struck last week.         
	An on-the-spot assessment by The Telegraph in Gosaba, where the chief minister ran into an unparalleled backlash by enraged cyclone victims, suggests relief materials are held up as long as 12 hours just to meet bureaucratic requirements.        
	Tight monitoring is required in a country notorious for pilferage but a full week after the cyclone hit, the administration has been unable to streamline the process.        
	The entry-making system in Gosaba is so convoluted that the relief materials are ferried by cycle vans over a 1km stretch from a ghat to a godown, only to be brought back to the same riverbank after faithfully recording the contents in a file. (See chart)        
	The journey of a relief consignment from Godkhali ghat to the godown and back captures everything that is wrong with the way Bengal is being run. Motorable roads do not exist beyond the ghat and the Bidhyadhari river. On the other side of the bank, there are only trails navigable by cycle vans.        
	For an administration that stirred out of stupor on Thursday  three days after the cyclone wreaked havoc  the requirement of entry-making was another diversion that devoured time.        
	We are distributing government relief materials and so we have to follow a set of processes, which may often take time, admitted a block official standing next to the 1,000sqft godown of the Gosaba block office this afternoon.         
	Out of over 5 lakh people in the Gosaba block, over 2.5 lakh people were affected after Aila struck the Sunderbans last Monday.         
	Soon after the chief ministers departure, some residents chased and beat up Gosaba BDO Amiya Bhushan Chakraborty, blaming him for the delay in relief delivery. An individual cannot be blamed for this. It would have been the same with a different official, said another block office employee, blaming the system and the slow initial response.         
	He was overseeing the unloading of cycle vans ferrying relief materials from the Gosaba ghat to the block office, around 1km from the Bidyadhari. The sacks of rice and pulses and tarpaulin sheets had reached Godkhali ghat, on the other bank, early this morning. The relief materials were unloaded from the trucks and our men there made the entries before loading them into steamers to be ferried to this side of the river, he added.         
	A fleet of 20 to 25 cycle vans brought the materials to the Gosaba block office godown from the Bidyadharis banks and a middle-aged block official was tallying the list before allowing them to be stored in the godown. At the block office, officials, in consultation with gram panchayat members, were deciding on the quantity of materials to be sent to places like Sajnekhali, Bally I, Bally II, Choto Mollakhali and Kochukhali.         
	Now the materials will be loaded in cycle vans and taken again to the Gosaba ghat, to be loaded into steamers or mechanised boats. Then the boats will sail for the affected areas, the official said. If a relief consignment arrives at Godkhali at 7am, it cant leave Gosaba ghat for distribution before at least 7pm.        
	Relief experts said the process helped prevent pilferage but multiple transhipment points delayed delivery. When the crisis is so grave, some of these processes can be tweaked to ensure efficient, speedy distribution, said Tanaji Sen, humanitarian services manager, REDR India, an NGO that specialises in disaster management.         
	Setting up a temporary godown either at Godkhali ghat  known as Singhadwar or the main entrance to the Sunderbans  or the Gosaba ghat to stock relief materials could have saved time, Sen said.         
	Such decisions need officers who have the ability and freedom to take quick decisions  virtues in short supply in the Bengal administration. BDO Chakraborty said setting up temporary godowns was impossible. There is hardly any place along the ghats to build a temporary godown.        
	But he conceded: Our main problem is transportation of relief material after it reaches the Godkhali ghat.        
	That is where the lack of another requirement of governance  foresight and planning  comes into play. Everybody knows the Sunderbans is a disaster-prone area. The most important part of disaster management is preparedness. Its clear the administration didnt have the preparedness to tackle a crisis like this, Sen said.

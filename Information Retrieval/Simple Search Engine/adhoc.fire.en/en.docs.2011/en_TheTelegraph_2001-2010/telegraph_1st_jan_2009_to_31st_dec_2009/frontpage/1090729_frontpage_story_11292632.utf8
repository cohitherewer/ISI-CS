	Ranchi/Ramgarh, July 28: The state road construction department has decided to construct a 765-metre diversion at Kujju to bypass the area on the Ranchi-Patna highway (NH-33) where a raging underground fire has sparked fears that the stretch might collapse any day now.        
	The state road construction secretary, N.N. Sinha, reviewed the dangerous stretch at Kujju today along with the chief engineer of the national highway wing, Murari Bhagat, and the executive engineer, Rajesh Gupta, and announced that the Central Coalfields Limited (CCL) management had agreed to fund the project that would cost around Rs 2.5 crore.        
	We are undertaking the survey work on a war footing in association with CCL. The new alignment (of the diversion) will be fixed in the next couple of days before work on the ground begins, Sinha said.        
	Commuting on the Ranchi-Patna stretch of NH-33, especially near Loha Gate of Kujju, has become extremely dangerous since last months underground fire that engulfed the abandoned mines alongside with CCL experts warning of a road cave-in any moment.        
	As many as eight boards have been put up to warn commuters and the district administration is trying its best to ensure that work on the diversion  between Lakdi Gate and Singh Hotel  could begin soon. And if the fire cannot be controlled and there is an eventual cave-in, the district administration has decided to divert traffic  a 15km detour  from Naya More of Kujju to reach Charhi on the highway via Ghato.        
	Ramgarh deputy commissioner Arun Kumar Singh said he was helpless. Only the secretary (road) is responsible for taking decisions related to the highway, he said earlier in the day, before word reached him about the state road construction departments inspection today.                                      
	Commenting on the underground fire, which recently flared up again on June 19, a senior CCL official claimed that for the last 10 years, the PSU had tried very hard to seal the abandoned mines. But villagers, backed by coal mafia, prevented such moves and continued to pilfer coal unscientifically, leading to cracks on the road surface.        
	The leader of Bhartiya Colliery Majdoor Sangh (BMS) in Kujju, Ganesh Singh, refuted the CCLs claim and blamed it and the district administration for ignoring the fire threat.        
	He said the areas BMS leader, Basant Kumar Rai, had raised the issue a number of times but no action was taken.         
	Sources said CCLs open cast mines, numbering 8, 9, and an inclined mine, number 10, had been abandoned in 1996. But the PSU did not seal the areas effectively, residents of nearby villages of Hesagarha, Banwar, Topa, Shibutola and Pundi have alleged all along.        
	This acted as an open invitation to the coal mafia, they added. If you decide to keep roti in front of a hungry man, then you cant fault him if he eats it. The same thing happened with the mines here, said Rakesh Kumar, a local resident.        
	Mining experts said when CCL was using the mines, it ensured that pillars were built inside to prevent any collapse. But ever since the PSU left and the coal mafia stepped in, indiscriminate mining led to huge caves being created within, thereby endangering the road above.        
	The CCL management knew about the fire for the past two years but they neglected it, alleged BMS leader Singh. This is not the time to accuse each other, said deputy commissioner Singh. Our priority should be to save the lives of commuters passing through this stretch, he added.

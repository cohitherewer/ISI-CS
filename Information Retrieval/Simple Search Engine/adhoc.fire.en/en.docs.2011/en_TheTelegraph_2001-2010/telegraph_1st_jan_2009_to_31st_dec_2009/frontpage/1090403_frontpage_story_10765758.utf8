	Berhampur, April 2: Congress president Sonia Gandhi today lashed out at the third front for its opportunism and lambasted the BJD-led government for allowing a peaceful state (like Orissa) to be taken over by violence.        
	Kaun jaane ye log chunav ke baad kiske saath jayenge (God only knows which party it will strike an alliance with, post-polls), she said, addressing her third rally in the state today. The country cant progress with such kind of opportunist alliance, said Sonia, while launching her partys election campaign in Orissa by addressing a series of rallies today  Bargarh and Koraput being the earlier venues.        
	Although she lashed out at the BJD, the Congress president avoided naming chief minister and BJD chief Naveen Patnaik. It was unfortunate that a peaceful Orissa was taken over by communal violence. Time has come to liberate the state and bring it back to the path of progress, she said referring to the violence that rocked Kandhamal.         
	She accused the Opposition of singling out terrorism as an issue  for the want of a better agenda. Those parties crying hoarse over the issue of terrorism could not protect Parliament when they were at the helm, she said. In order to drive home the point, she asked the crowd which party was in power at the time of the Parliament attack, to which she received a deafening cry: It was the BJP.         
	Clad in a Sambalpuri sari, Sonia played on sentiment by mentioning her late husband. When any Congress leader puts his feet on the Berhampur soil he feels proud, as the people here have given their undying support to us she said.         
	Congress has won the Berhampur Lok Sabha seat since Independence  except twice in 1951 and 1999.

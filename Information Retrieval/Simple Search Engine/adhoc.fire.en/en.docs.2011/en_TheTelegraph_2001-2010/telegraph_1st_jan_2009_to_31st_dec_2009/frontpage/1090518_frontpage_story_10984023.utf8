The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Why BJP could not connect
                                                                                                           Why BJP could not connect
          SWAPAN SETH                              
	When you make a great beer, you dont make a fuss  Carlsberg         
	As a trainee in the Thompson company, one was taught the basic rule of communication: the stimulus-response theory. The example cited was that of a plane going through an air pocket with the pilot saying dont panic  evidently every passenger would panic.        
	Among the many things the BJP got wrong in these elections was communication. Strong leadership. Decisive governance should have been the consumer response. Not the brand stimulus.        
	The second thing we were taught was the why buy me? theory. Not the why not buy them theory. The BJP communication insinuated weak leadership and indecisive governance on the part of the Congress.        
	Brands are built on the back of attributes and benefits. A cub communicator knows that. Brands are not built on finger-pointing and competitive deficiencies. The BJP got both its math and messaging horribly wrong.         
	Contrast it with the Congress communication. No marks for excellence there either but a tick for its tack  aam aadmi.        
	The Congress did not prop up a Gandhi. Instead it put people on the pedestal.         
	And in a magical marketing moment, the Congress pulled the carpet from under the Hindutva flooring by usurping Jai Ho.        
	Marketing, in my estimation is about carpe diem. With Jai Ho, the Congress did just that.        
	It is odd that the campaigns from both the BJP and the Congress camps derived divine inspiration from the Obama campaign.        
	While the BJP adopted the tactics of the Obama campaign (read Internet, social networking sites), the Congress adopted the strategy (Yes, we can  aam aadmi) Not, Yes, Me Can.         
	My years in advertising and marketing have taught me that great brands are participative. They are inclusive.        
	The BJP campaign smacked of arrogance and an understanding that was completely unfounded.         
	In his astoundingly wonderful book, From Good To Great Jim Collins talked about leadership. Good leadership looks at itself in the mirror after a job well done. Much like the BJP in spite of a job badly done.        
	Great leadership, on the other hand, opens the window to find out who it must give credit to.        
	Finally, the mirror pronounced its verdict in these elections.        
	The people were the fairest of them all.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            An activist in Delhi demands passage of the original HIV/AIDS bill.                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 25: The law ministry has truncated a proposed bill intended to protect the various rights of HIV-infected people in a manner that will leave them vulnerable to harassment or exploitation, lawyers and activists have said today.         
	The HIV/AIDS bill after revisions by the law ministry fails to address several issues including relief to HIV-infected persons during health care, emergency situations and the vulnerabilities of children, they said.         
	The law ministry has gone beyond its mandate and deleted substantive provisions  the work of the law ministry was only to check whether the provisions of the bill are legally workable, said Anand Grover, a lawyer with the HIV/AIDS unit of Lawyers Collective, a non-government organisation that had helped draft the bill after consultations across the country.         
	Activists protesting against the revisions have cited the law ministrys deletion of provisions relating to a proposed health ombudsman who would help ensure that health care services are not denied to HIV-infected persons.         
	Under the draft bill finalised by the health ministry, the health ombudsman would have to issue orders to make available health care services in 24 hours in case of an emergency. The law ministry has deleted the emergency clause.         
	Denial of health care services is a continuous problem  it happens routinely with HIV-infected persons. This 24-hour provision would be crucial in emergencies, said Anushree Kini, an advocacy officer with Lawyers Collective.         
	The law ministry has deleted sections that provided civil penalties in case of breach of health ombudsman orders.         
	While the health ministry version left it to the discretion of a health care provider whether to disclose the HIV status of a client to a partner, the law ministry has replaced the may with a shall  making HIV status of partners mandatory.         
	The law ministry has also deleted provisions to allow an older sibling to act as guardian to other siblings even if the older was a minor and to protect the property of children of parents infected with HIV.         
	The original bill as drafted by the health ministry had articulated the need for pricing medications and diagnostic tools in an open and transparent manner. The law ministry has deleted the words  in a manner that is transparent, accountable, and open to public scrutiny.

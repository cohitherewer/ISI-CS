  - Congress workers speech stuns ministers           RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                            Sonia in Delhi. Picture by Ramakant Kushwaha                                        
	New Delhi, Feb. 8: When Ubaid Sheikh ended his hard-hitting 10-minute speech, Congress foot soldiers erupted in thunderous applause while the leaders on the dais squirmed and Sonia Gandhi looked grim.        
	These people, floating around in red-light cars, imagine its beneath their dignity to mingle with the party workers. But they should know the red light will shine only when the workers rise and shine because these people become leaders and ministers only on the strength of the zindabad, murdabad slogans that the workers raise, said Sheikh, whose words were echoed over and over at the national convention of the Congress which swears by the aam aadmi.        
	The targets of attack  ministers and party office-bearers  looked stunned and embarrassed as the sugar mill contractor and district Intuc president from Maharashtras Ahmednagar tore into them.         
	The workers who made up the gathering of Congress district and block presidents could not stop clapping  Sheikh, 42, got the most applause after Sonia and Rahul Gandhi.        
	Sheikh stole the show but he wasnt the only worker to tell it like it is to self-anointed leaders. Rajesh Tiwari, a block president from Chhattisgarh, accused state leaders of being in cahoots with the BJP during the recent state elections and working to defeat the official candidates. Ajit Jogi, the former chief minister, later avoided eye contact with the media.         
	Our heart and soul belongs to the Nehru-Gandhi family and not any other neta. But we cannot get ahead unless we do Ganesh parikrama of these state leaders. They should emulate Soniaji who rebuffed the highest post and set an example with her sacrifice, Tiwari said.        
	Senapati Venu of Keralas Idukki district wondered why the Congress rewarded time-servers with tickets without taking the views of district and block functionaries.        
	Digvijay Puri of Himachal Pradesh slammed a central minister from the state  though Puri did not name him, Anand Sharma is the only central minister from the state  for not inviting a single Congress worker to an official function he presided over recently. In an Opposition (BJP)-ruled state, it helps if our minister interacts with the workers on such occasions, it boosts their morale, he said.        
	The theme running through the speeches was that while the workers looked up to the Gandhis as the Congresss first family, they had no time for parivarvaad by any other family.         
	The message seemed to have got through to Sonia and Rahul. In her concluding remarks, the Congress president said merit would be the sole criterion in ticket distribution and not privilege or quota.         
	Quota in the Congress lexicon is about family, not gender or caste  a person privileged to belong to a Congress family of vintage has the first right over a ticket, if other things are equal, sources explained.        
	Sonia also warned the party against inducting Aaya Rams and Gaya Rams.         
	Even in her inaugural address, the Congress president had brought up the family-equals-privilege syndrome in the party.        
	 We have lakhs of youths in our organisation. There are some among them who have been the beneficiaries of their family lineage. But those who have no such background are many more in number. All these youths are our partys future. I want to congratulate the Youth Congress and NSUI, which under Rahuls leadership has held free and fair elections in Punjab and Uttarakhand. This is a new and hopeful beginning, she said.        
	Rahuls words would have been music to the ears of Sheikh and others like him. The Congress general secretary spoke of harnessing the countrys abundant youth power but admitted this was tough unless the wall of doubts between politics and young people was brought down.         
	I met young people who asked if there was no principle of accountability in politics, how would merit be rewarded. How can they serve common people if their work goes unrecognised? Who understands this better than the block and district presidents who toil for years but when it comes to getting a ticket, someone from the top walks away with it? Rahul asked.

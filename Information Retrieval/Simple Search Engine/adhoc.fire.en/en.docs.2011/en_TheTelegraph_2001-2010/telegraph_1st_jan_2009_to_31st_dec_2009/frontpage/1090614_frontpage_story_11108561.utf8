          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Imphal, June 13: Panic-stricken Bengali migrants today decided to leave Manipur even as the bodies of the four labourers killed on the campus of Central Agricultural University in Imphal West district on Thursday night were flown to Calcutta.         
	Two gunmen had called out six labourers, all from West Bengal, from their hut on the university campus, asked them to sit in a row in the universitys football ground and had shot them from behind. Four of them were killed while two escaped, one with a minor injury. The labourers were engaged in construction work on the university premises.        
	The terror-struck migrant workers today said they no longer felt safe in the state. The government has opened two relief camps for their protection. The police have assured them of protection but the workers are not convinced.        
	We do not want to work here any longer. We have decided to return home. We are waiting for the arrival of our contractor from Calcutta. As soon as he comes we will take our dues from him and go home, a middle-aged Bengali labourer, who refused to disclose his name, said.        
	A large number of Bengalis working in different parts of the state They are in a state of terror after the killings and want to go home, P. Mondal, a BSNL employee, who visited a relief camp, said.        
	We came here to make daily earnings so that we can feed our family. What will happen to them if I am killed here? I can earn money but cannot get back my life once I am dead, Sahanur Mitta, a labourer said.        
	The bodies of the four labourers killed in the incident were today taken to Calcutta by an Air India (IC 211) flight. Sambhunath Mondal, a relative of Binod Mondal, the contractor who had taken the labourers from West Bengal to Manipur for the construction work, escorted the bodies to Calcutta.        
	The contractor is at present in Calcutta, his native place. He had sent Sambhunath to the construction site to supervise the work.         
	The bodies were allowed to be taken out of Imphal after the West Bengal government put strong pressure on the Ibobi Singh government. An official source said this was the first time that the government had allowed migrants bodies to be taken to their respective homes.         
	Earlier, the state government, fearing a backlash on Manipuris living in other states, had persuaded the relatives of the victims to cremate their bodies here.         
	With Thursdays incident, the number of migrants killed this year has gone up to 22.         
	The police are yet to name any group behind the latest killings though in two earlier incidents, they had named the UNLF.         
	The Manipur government has opened two relief camps in the city to shelter the migrants and has posted officials to take care of the needs of the labourers.        
	We are giving them a sum of Rs 100 each daily for their fooding. But we cannot say how long the camp will continue, a government official at a camp said.

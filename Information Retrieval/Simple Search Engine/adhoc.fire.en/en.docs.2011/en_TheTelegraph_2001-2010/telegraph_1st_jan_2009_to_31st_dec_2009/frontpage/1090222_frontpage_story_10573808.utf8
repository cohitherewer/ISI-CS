                                                                                                           Modi springs top cop surprise
          BASANT RAWAT                              
	Ahmedabad, Feb. 21: Narendra Modi has sprung a surprise ahead of the elections by naming a Muslim officer the Gujarat police chief.        
	S.S. Khandwawala was today appointed director-general of police in place of P.C. Pande, who was under a cloud over his role in the 2002 post-Godhra riots. Pande was Ahmedabad city police commissioner at that time.         
	Khandwawala, a 1973 batch officer, will be the first Muslim to occupy the police chiefs chair in the state. Pande will take charge of the anti-corruption bureau that Khandwawala was handling.        
	Although Khandwawala is the senior-most IPS officer after Pande, his appointment has taken bureaucratic circles by surprise. An IPS officer said Muslim officials were generally sidelined in Gujarat.         
	Muslim leaders termed the decision unusual and unbelievable. Rights activist Hanif Lakdawala said: We call it very unusual because we never expected it, given the chief ministers image and track record.         
	Sources said the decision was in keeping with Modis calculated image makeover ahead of the elections.        
	A government official said the chief minister had killed two birds with one stone.        
	One, by appointing a Muslim as head of the states police force, he had sent the message that he wished to make amends for the past.        
	Two, by easing out Pande, he had pre-empted the Election Commission, which had removed him ahead of last years Assembly polls. Pande was brought back after Modi was re-elected.        
	Pande was the Ahmedabad city commissioner in 2002 when a mob attacked Gulbarg Society in Meghaninagar, less than 2km from the police hub, and burnt alive former Congress MP Ehsan Jaffry and 38 others.         
	The officer, due to retire on March 31 this year, also faces the prospect of arrest. The special investigation team probing the riot cases afresh has recorded his statement.        
	Sources said Pandes chances of getting away were limited. DSP K.G. Erda, who was inspector of Meghaninagar police station when the Gulbarg Society massacre took place, has been arrested for dereliction of duty.         
	The sources said Modi was carefully reaching out to the Muslims. On Thursday, the Gujarat government told the high court in an affidavit that state minister Maya Kodnani had instigated a mob and distributed weapons to carry out the 2002 Naroda riots that left 95 people dead.         
	She was the leader of a mob and an MLA. The allegation against her is she was instigating the mob to commit a crime and, therefore, she was playing the main role, PTI quoted the affidavit as saying.         
	Citizens groups said Modi was donning a liberal mask as the riot cases had returned to haunt the government.         
	Modi can sense what is coming. In order to save face, the chief minister has appointed a Muslim as DGP and removed the controversial P.C. Pande, which he should have done long ago. It is nothing but a panic reaction, said social activist Fr Cedric Prakash.

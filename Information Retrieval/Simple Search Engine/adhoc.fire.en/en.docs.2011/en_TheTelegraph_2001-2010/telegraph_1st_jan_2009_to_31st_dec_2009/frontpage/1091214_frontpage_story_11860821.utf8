The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Soccer joins chorus to save jobs
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Soccer joins chorus to save jobs
  - Players wear SOS T-shirts to appeal to Tata-owned company          AMIT ROY                            Middlesbrough players Isaiah Osbourne and Julio Arca wearing T-shirts in support of workers from the Teesside Corus Steel plant                                        
	London, Dec. 13: Plans by Tata-owned Corus steel to mothball its factories in Teesside with a loss of 1,700 jobs in the new year have provoked opposition from soccer stars from Middlesbrough Football Club who wore Save Our Steel T-shirts last night.        
	Fans and trade union members who are trying to stave off the closure of the Redcar plant were given strong support by the footballers who wore the shirts when warming up ahead of their fixture against Cardiff City at the Riverside Stadium.        
	Middlesbrough Football Club, known affectionately as The Boro, is an English football club based in Middlesbrough which now plays in the Football League Championship for the 2009-10 season following relegation from the Premier League. Formed in 1876, the team has played at the Riverside Stadium since August 1995.        
	The steel workers, who are pressing for a meeting with Ratan Tata, are facing a bleak Christmas following the Corus decision, announced on December 4, to stop manufacturing steel slabs in Redcar. This is expected to have a devastating effect on the whole community because generations of workers have depended on the steel industry, the main employer for more than a century.        
	The unions have already said that Tata Steel, whose acquisition of Corus they had backed, has a moral and social obligation to protect the livelihoods of the workers.        
	Corus has blamed an international consortium which it alleges has broken a 10-year, legally binding agreement to buy the slabs.         
	According to Kirby Adams, the chief executive of Corus, the consortium members should hang their heads in shame.        
	 Given the difficulty in protecting jobs in recession-hit UK, union leaders have told The Telegraph that we just cannot understand how Tatas plans to open a car plant was rejected by politicians in India. This is barmy. We wish we had the chance.        
	Last night, nearly 100 steel workers and their families marched around the Riverside Stadium ahead of kick-off, parading banners before lining up to welcome the teams on to the pitch.        
	Middlesbrough chairman Steve Gibson spoke for the community when he said: We were devastated to hear this potentially catastrophic news for Teesside and we will do all in our power to continue to support steel workers in their fight to get government intervention. The issue is of huge importance to the whole area and we want our local MPs to fight not just to get cash for training but to save these jobs.        
	The Middlesbrough mayor Ray Mallon added his voice: The people of Teesside simply do not accept the governments position to let the steel industry in this region die without a fight with the loss of so many jobs and the human cost that brings. I know the people want action from this government to keep the furnace open. Along with Steve Gibson and the unions, I will be relentless in my pursuit of that action.        
	Michael Leahy, general secretary of the Community union, which represents steel workers, will meet business secretary Peter Mandelson next Tuesday to call for further government support for the campaign. To make matters worse, Cardiff won 1-0 last night.

	New Delhi, Aug. 17: Union home minister P. Chidambaram today made a pointed reference to the absence of political representation from Bengal at a security meeting, the observation coming at a time the operation in Lalgarh runs the risk of turning listless.        
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee could not attend the session of chief ministers in Delhi because of fever but he did not depute any other minister to the meeting, which meant that the state was represented by bureaucrats who were not allowed to speak.        
	Bengals speech was tabled at the venue, unlike some other states whose chief ministers could not attend but ensured that they were heard by sending other ministers.        
	Chidambaram referred to Bengal at a media conference. West Bengal was not represented by any minister. So, the chief ministers speech was considered read, the home minister told reporters this afternoon, soon after a meeting on internal security and before the start of another to specifically discuss Left-wing extremism.        
	Chidambaram added that the officials present did not get a chance to speak. Union home ministry sources said Bengals turn came up towards the end of the meeting on internal security but neither chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti nor home secretary Ardhendu Sen were allowed to speak.        
	They cannot make a policy decision nor a commitment and when we consider time constraints (in delivering speeches), they do not stand anywhere in the hierarchy, a government spokesperson said.        
	In Calcutta, officials said Bhattacharjee did not nominate anyone in his place because officially, no one enjoys the Number Two slot in the cabinet.        
	Normally, the Bengal officials pointed out, when the chief minister is out of the country, he nominates an acting chief minister who officiates on his behalf. But since Bhattacharjee is in the city, the question of appointing one did not arise, an official added.        
	A note has been handed over by the chief secretary to the central government, an official said in Calcutta. So, that is effectively conveying the governments views. The chief minister is much better though a slight fever persists, the official added.        
	Union home ministry officials, while acknowledging the chief ministers health impediment, pointed out that states like Uttar Pradesh, Kerala and Puducherry did send other ministers, not necessarily the Number Two, because their chief ministers could not make it.         
	Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavatis speech was read by parliamentary affairs minister Lalji Verma while the two southern states were represented by home ministers Kodiyeri Balakrishnan and E. Valsaraj, respectively.        
	The veiled criticism came on a day the security services were fooled in Lalgarh by a Maoist-backed group to hold a meeting. The state government has already admitted that Phase II of the Lalgarh operation was a failure.        
	The Bengal government is keen on a joint operation in Jharkhand  a reference to which was made in Bhattacharjees speech that was considered read today.

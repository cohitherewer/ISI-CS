          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                      
	Calcutta, Aug. 2: The CPM has confined itself to superficial changes in the Left Front ministry, belying assertions to inject dynamism after the Lok Sabha poll debacle and desisting from dropping ill and infirm veterans.        
	A notable feature in the shuffle is the transfer of panchayat and rural development from Surjya Kanta Mishra but he is still left with another crucial ministry in health.        
	Another factor was a claim that the governments second-in-command, industries minister Nirupam Sen, wanted to give up his berths and opt for organisation work.        
	Sen has been persuaded to stay back but the revelation will add grist to suggestions of strain in the relationship between him and chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee following differences of opinion over the reasons for the poor performance of the Left in the Lok Sabha polls. Sen was seen as tilting towards the central leaderships stand that local factors, not national issues as claimed by several Bengal leaders, were primarily responsible for the drubbing.        
	Sen has reluctantly retained his three portfolios  industry and commerce, industrial reconstruction and public enterprises as well as planning and development.         
	He had expressed the desire to the politburo and secretariat to leave the government and devote more time to rejuvenating the party organisation in this hour of crisis. But we refused to let him do so, said a central committee member.         
	The CPM state secretariat finalised the shuffle in the presence of party general secretary Prakash Karat and politburo member Sitaram Yechury after orchestrating a demand for changes in the government from the floor of the state committee meeting.         
	Party leaders cited compulsion to restrict the number of ministers as well as political-organisational factors as the reasons behind the limited exercise.        
	Chief minister Bhattacharjee, despite drawing flak from his comrades on the police failure to protect the CPM workers from Maoist and Trinamul onslaught, retained the home portfolio, along with other responsibilities.         
	According to some secretariat sources, Bhattacharjee wanted to offload a few responsibilities but others persuaded him not to do so. He may later give up science and technology.        
	On Mishra losing panchayat and rural development, some leaders claimed he volunteered to shed his additional burden. But others said he was under pressure from the leadership as the party central committee had listed health, rural development and malfunctioning panchayats as areas of poor performance.        
	The allocation of panchayat and rural development to Anisur Rahman may have been prompted by the partys keenness to win back minority voters who had deserted the Left in substantial numbers.        
	One reason that forced the partys hand on unwell ministers is the hospitalisation of Subhas Chakraborty who is on ventilator ( ). No change has been announced on Chakrabortys portfolios  transport, sports and youth affairs  in view of his illness.         
	Another secretariat member, Gautam Deb, retained housing and public health engineering as he was not counted among the seriously ill and old. The unwell Mrinal Banerjee and the aged Sailen Sarkar were not dropped. They have been relieved of their additional portfolios.        
	Banerjee lost labour but retained the power department despite the party citing the dismal power situation, including failure in rural electrification, as a big factor behind voter alienation.         
	Sources said decisions would be taken later about some other junior ministers, including Sushanta Ghosh, the western Bengal development minister.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Siliguri, July 28: A 32-year-old man was today killed for no apparent reason other than questioning the need to close a shop during an annual but largely ignored bandh in Bengal, the second such death in 48 hours in a state where the administration has done little to deter shutdown-related lawlessness.        
	Ananda Das was hacked to death this morning in Jalpaiguri for raising questions during a bandh to commemorate the death anniversary of Naxalite leader Charu Mazumdar. On Monday, 21-year-old Arghya Samanta died of shock after he was threatened at sword-point for refusing to close his hardware shop in Burdwan during a bandh called by another outfit. ( )        
	In both cases, law-enforcers could offer little help, though police later arrested three youths for the Jalpaiguri incident. Referring to todays murder, state home secretary Ardhendu Sen said he was awaiting an official report.        
	Ananda Das, a farmer associated with the CPMs youth wing, was attacked while he was sipping tea at 7.30am at the lone stall, barring a paan shop, that opened in the neighbourhood.        
	A group, allegedly owing allegiance to a Naxalite faction that enforces a bandh every year to observe the death anniversary of Mazumdar who died in police custody in 1972, asked the owners to shut the shops.        
	When Ananda and two friends wanted to know why they were forcing the shops to shut down, they were instantly attacked with sharp weapons. There was no provocation. The three were left bleeding, while the attackers just walked towards a nearby forest, an eyewitness said.        
	The two survivors have been admitted to hospital.

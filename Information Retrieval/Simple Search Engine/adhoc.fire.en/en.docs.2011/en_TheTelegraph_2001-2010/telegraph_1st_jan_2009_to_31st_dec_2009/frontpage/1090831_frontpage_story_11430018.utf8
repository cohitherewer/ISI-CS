	London, Aug. 30: Naomi Campbell has accused the advertising business of using the recession as an excuse to drop black models.         
	The 39-year-old supermodel claims that major companies are refusing to use non-white women to promote their products.         
	This year, we have gone back all the way that we had advanced, she said. I dont see any black woman, or of any other race, in big advertising campaigns, Campbell (in picture) said.        
	Unfortunately, we are the same as before, she said. People, in the panic of the recession, dont dare to put a girl of colour in their campaign, full stop. Nor of any other race. Its a shame. Its very sad.                    THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Mittal shocker puts state on backfoot
                                                                                                           Mittal shocker puts state on backfoot
  - Steel maker may move if land issues persist        OUR BUREAU                                    
	Oct. 5: ArcelorMittal, the worlds largest steel maker, has threatened to abandon its $20-billion steel projects in Jharkhand and Orissa over delays, but will look for new sites within the country for the plants.        
	The company continues to work on its two greenfield projects in Jharkhand and Orissa. However, in the event that land acquisition continues to prove difficult, we will start to search for alternative sites in India..., ArcelorMittal chairman and CEO Lakshmi Mittal said in a statement.        
	The statement followed a report in the Financial Times, which carried an interview of Mittal, stating: Lakshmi Mittal is close to pulling out of a $20-billion plan to build two large steel plants in India.        
	In the statement, Mittal said: ArcelorMittal has no plans to quit its investment plans for India... is an important country for steel demand growth and... important part of ArcelorMittals long-term strategic plans.        
	Shortly after the merger of Mittal Steel with Arcelor in 2006, Mittal had announced plans for a 12-million-tonne-per-annum steel plant in Orissa and, thereafter, an identical project in Jharkhand. But work on acquiring land for the projects hit a wall of opposition from locals.        
	The Jharkhand industries department reacted cautiously. We have not been communicated anything officially. We are certainly concerned about Mittals plans as we value every partner, industries secretary N.N. Sinha told The Telegraph in Ranchi.         
	He, however, clarified that the worlds largest steel-maker had to acquire land by instilling confidence among the people. The process to acquire the government land of around 1,000 acres is almost complete, he added.         
	The government can facilitate a dialogue between villagers and ArcelorMittal and for that matter anything within the limits of resettlement and rehabilitation policy. But the company has to purchase land from villagers by winning their confidence, he said.        
	Mittal told the Financial Times that people in India had to be educated into supporting gradual industrialisation, including the need to build new steel plants on agricultural land.        
	Although Mittal said he was still committed to building at least one steel plant in India, abandoning his plan to have two sites producing between them about 24 million tonnes of steel a year by around 2015 would be a big blow, the Financial Times said.        
	The newspaper quoted Mittal as saying that the delays in persuading farmers and others to sell the land required for building the plants were unacceptable to the company.        
	It seems there is a big communication gap between ArcelorMittal and the villagers of Khunti and Gumla where the steel major has identified land, industry director Aradhana Patnaik said in Ranchi.        
	She cited examples of Tata Steel, Electro Steel, Jindal Steel and Power Limited (JSPL) for having acquired private land on their own initiative.         
	The company has to weed out middlemen and come forward and convince the villagers that the plant will bring jobs, hospitals, educational institutes, roads and development of their villages, Patnaik said.         
	Adviser to governor Wilfred Lakra, who is in the charge of the industries department, said the administration had decided not to take decisions regarding land acquisition, or to grant any mining and prospecting licences under Presidents rule. All such decisions have to be taken by an elected government, he pointed out.

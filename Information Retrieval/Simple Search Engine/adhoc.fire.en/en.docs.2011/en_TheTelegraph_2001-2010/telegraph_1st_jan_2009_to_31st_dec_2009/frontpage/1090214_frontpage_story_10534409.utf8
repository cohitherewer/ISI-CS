                                                                                                           Coromandel tragedy on day of budget boast on safety
  - 16 killed in Orissa mishap          LALMOHAN PATNAIK AND SUBRAT DAS                                                    
	Jajpur Road and Bhubaneswar, Feb. 13:At least 16 passengers were killed and 50 injured when 14 coaches of the Chennai-bound Coromandel Express from Howrah derailed near the Jajpur-Keonjhar Road rail station, 120km from Bhubaneswar, this evening.        
	The tragedy came a few hours after Lalu Prasad unveiled a voter-friendly interim railway budget that proposed cuts in fares and underscored the declining trend in accidents during his tenure.        
	Sources said the Coromandel Express, one of the most popular trains in the east that ferries countless patients to better healthcare facilities in the south, got derailed between 7.45pm and 8pm when it was approaching Jajpur-Keonjhar Road station.        
	The first four coaches from the engine jumped tracks, dragging along 10 others that overturned. Eight to nine coaches in the rear were unaffected.         
	Several passengers are feared to have been trapped either under the bogies or within compartments. Rescue operations were affected by the darkness, the sources said.         
	Three of the dead have been identified as Pawan Pillai, Laxmi Narayan Manna and A.R. Sinha. Grieving relatives thronged Howrah station where several south-bound trains have been cancelled or re-routed. The disruptions are expected to continue for a few days. (Reports on Page 4)        
	A witness said he heard a bang before the derailment but it was not clear what the cause was.        
	Injured passengers have been admitted to the Jajpur Road hospital, the Jajpur district headquarters hospital and the SCB Medical College and Hospital at Cuttack, official sources said. The Orissa disaster rapid action force has reached the spot with gas cutters and ambulance.        
	Special arrangements have been made for treatment of injured passengers at the SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack, the chief ministers office said.        
	Ironically, in the afternoon in the Lok Sabha, railway minister Lalu Prasad had held aloft the utilitys safety record.         
	In the last five years, there has also been a significant improvement in railway safety and a steep reduction in the number of railway accidents. The number of consequential accidents came down to 194 in 2007-08, as against 325 in 2003-04. I am happy to report to the House that this declining trend is continuing in 2008-09 also, the minister said in his interim budget speech.        
	After the accident, Lalu Prasad said: I will try to make Indian Railways accident-free in the coming days and years. The number of accidents during my tenure as railway minister has been minimal.        
	He announced Rs 5 lakh compensation and a job to the next of kin of those who were killed. The seriously injured will be given Rs 50,000 and those who suffered minor wounds Rs 10,000. Free medical treatment will be provided to all the injured.        
	Veterans said they could not recall any other big train accident on a rail budget day. I think this is the first time such an accident has occurred on a rail budget day, said R.C. Acharya, a former member of the Railway Board. The Godhra carnage had happened a day after the railway budget in 2002.        
	A central team, including medical experts, has rushed to the spot, a Railway Board spokesperson said tonight in Delhi. Junior railway minister R. Velu and Railway Board chairman S.S. Khurana have been asked to proceed to the site.

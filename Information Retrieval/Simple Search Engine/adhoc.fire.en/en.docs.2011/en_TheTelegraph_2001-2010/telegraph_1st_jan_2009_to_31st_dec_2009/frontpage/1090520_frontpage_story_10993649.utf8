The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Off to a decisive half decade
                                                                                                           Off to a decisive half decade
  - Regular monitoring of ministries in Manmohan blueprint           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Singh at the Congress parliamentary party meeting. (Rajesh Kumar)                                         
	New Delhi, May 19: Manmohan Singh today listed his priorities for the decisive half decade that lies ahead of the new government and appeared to suggest that he would take an assertive role to ensure that poll promises were implemented by each ministry.        
	I will ask every minister to set time-bound targets for implementation of our election promises and the various programmes and policies of each ministry, he said, laying down his blueprint for improved governance.        
	We will undertake a quarterly review of programme implementation by each ministry, added Singh, whose clean and generally efficient governance is also being credited for the UPA victory.        
	The Prime Minister- designate was addressing a party meeting soon after being elected Congress parliamentary party leader today.        
	Singh and his Prime Ministers Office (PMO) had tried to tie ministers to time-bound implementation of policies over the last two years of the outgoing government too. But several senior ministers, including human resource development minister Arjun Singh, had quietly resisted the effort, officially agreeing to the concept but effectively doing little to ensure speedy implementation.        
	Quarterly reviews of each ministry are now conducted from the limited perspective of utilisation of allocated funds to keep a check on bureaucratic bottlenecks and minimise idle funds.        
	Singhs statement today, however, suggests that the PMO will not just monitor funds utilisation but also set up a mechanism to keep tabs on the implementation of election promises.        
	The plan risks running into allegations of over-interference by the PMO, a charge several bureaucrats across ministries had levelled against the outgoing unit.        
	Singh, however, said: This mandate comes with the challenge of rising expectations.        
	He said the youth, who had voted in large numbers for the party, were impatient by nature. They will not tolerate business as usual.... They expect the government to cater to their aspirations. We have to make the government more efficient and effective, more responsive and active.        
	Singh said the decisive half decade could be used to reduce poverty, create employment and promote industrialisation if the growth of the last five years could be sustained. The period ahead could be decisive. We must grasp the nettle firmly and forge ahead, he said.        
	Singh made it clear the policy of inclusive growth would continue. This election verdict is a verdict for inclusive growth. It is a verdict for equitable development. It is a verdict for a secular and plural India.        
	The government, he said, would work closely with the states to ensure better implementation of welfare schemes like the rural employment guarantee scheme and the national rural health mission.        
	He added that the success of social-sector measures required the economic growth of the past five years to be maintained, and this entailed new investment and better management of government finances. This also requires reform of the economy... revitalisation of agriculture and acceleration of industrial development.        
	Singh spoke of the need to reverse the effects of the global economic crisis, which he said has hurt us.        
	There is some slowing down of investment and employment generation. We have to reverse this.        
	The world, he said, was witnessing a shift in growth from the West to the East. We cannot afford to miss this bus now. We cannot afford to lag behind the rising economies of the East.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Lapang dares MPA to quit
                                                                                                           Lapang dares MPA to quit
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Shillong, April 5: The Meghalaya Progressive Alliances threat that it would resign en masse if the governor invited the Congress-led coalition to form the government failed to cut ice with D.D. Lapang, who said no one would be able to prevent them from returning to power.         
	Lapang, in fact, dared the MPA members to resign and even said they did not have the guts to do so.         
	The contradictions within the MPA will prevent its effort to go ahead with a mass resignation, Lapang said.         
	The MPA at a meeting last night decided to wait for a while before taking a final decision on the resignation keeping in mind the sentiments of the new legislators.         
	The alliance members said since the new MLAs had completed just one year, any hasty step at the moment would hamper their poll prospects if there were fresh elections.         
	Of the 14 NCP legislators supporting the MPA, eight are new, while the UDP has four newcomers in its total of eight.         
	One of the two HSPDP legislators is a newcomer as is one of the Independents.         
	The meeting tried to respect the sentiments of the newcomers to prevent a revolt and decided to wait for an opportune moment before taking the final plunge.         
	Moreover, they discussed the financial constraints of fighting the elections again.         
	Lapang, on the other hand, said the Congress was determined to form the government even if there was stiff opposition from the MPA.        
	The governor examined the relevant papers and went through the Constitution and only after that did he recommend the withdrawal of Presidents rule in the state, Lapang said.         
	Asked if there is a legal hurdle to government formation, with the disqualification proceedings pending against four legislators who had deserted the MPA, Lapang said: The Speakers ruling against the four legislators is unconstitutional and illegal. We hope that the Speaker will not act in such a way, which would bring bad reputation to the Assembly, known all over the country for its dignity and decorum.         
	Asked about a case pending in the Supreme Court filed by the MPA against Presidents rule, Lapang said this does not prevent the formation of government by the Congress-led group.

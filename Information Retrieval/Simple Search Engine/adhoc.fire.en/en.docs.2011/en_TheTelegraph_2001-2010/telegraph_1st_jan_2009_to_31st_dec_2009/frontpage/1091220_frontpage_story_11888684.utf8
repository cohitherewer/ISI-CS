  - Pakistans Parveen offered job after holiday umpiring           AMIT ROY                      Parveen Kausar Shah. Picture courtesy: Oldham Evening Chronicle                                
	London, Dec. 19: A Pakistani woman who officiated as a cricket umpire in a mens league match in England while on a months holiday did so well that she has been told she can have the job permanently if she returns next season.        
	Parveen Kausar Shah, 50, who had come to see her relatives in Oldham in Lancashire, was fully conversant with the lbw law and other complicated rules of umpiring because she has herself played womens cricket for Pakistan.        
	Her efforts should improve the image of Pakistani umpires in England, where they have historically been the butt of jokes.        
	Parveen was given the chance to stand in the Shaw versus Friarmere second XI fixture at Holebottom Clough in the Saddleworth and District Cricket League on July 18. This was after Asif Lohdi, a local Pakistani known to her relatives, had intimated she was keen to do a spot of umpiring.        
	In an area of England where Pakistanis have enthusiastically taken up cricket, Lohdi, who himself plays for a club called Glodwick, approached Peter Lilley, the chairman of the umpiring panel in the local league.        
	Being a generous sort of man, 71-year-old Lilley saw no reason why Parveen should not stand  though we have not had a woman umpire before, he admitted to The Telegraph.         
	Bolton (a nearby league) has had women umpires but we havent. Just to make sure everything went well, I decided to stand with her in the game at the other end.        
	Everything did go swimmingly well. The men treated her like a lady. The men behaved impeccably, he said, hinting this was not always the case.        
	There is a shortage of umpires, Lilley explained, adding that many do not want the job because players can get abusive when decisions do not go their way.        
	Lilley fetched a small piece of paper carefully preserved in his wallet. She has written her name, Parveen Kausar Shah. If she comes back next year, she can stand every week, he promised.        
	This will depend, of course, on visas and work permits and British immigration officials in Pakistan, but it looked today as though the Third Umpire in the sky was smiling benignly on Parveen.        
	Pakistani umpires can do with all the good advertisement they get in England.         
	The on-field slanging match between Shakoor Rana and England captain Mike Gatting in 1987  and the dousing of Idris Beg by English players in their hotel decades earlier  are legend though the likes of Aleem Dar have recently improved Pakistani umpires image.        
	Parveen has developed something of an international Internet fan following  and not just in Pakistan. Kevin Richardson, an enterprising reporter on the Oldham Evening Chronicle, wrote that Parveens debut amounted to a slice of history.        
	She broke new ground by becoming the first woman to umpire a competitive game, he reported in the paper on July 21.        
	Lilley told him: The players were very courteous towards her and there was no bad language  not even directed at me, which was unusual.        
	Richardson noted that Parveen has been umpiring since 2006 and has taken charge of mens and womens games in Pakistan, and she has represented her country at cricket, playing for the national one-day international team.        
	In theory, there is no bar against women standing in mens cricket or vice versa.        
	Only they have to be of a sufficient standard, commented Rhian Evans, media manager of the England and Wales Cricket Board.        
	A Pakistan Cricket Board official said that thanks to Parveens achievements, more women will be encouraged to increase their involvement with cricket. She is making great strides in an area previously dominated by men and is a great advertisement for equality in Pakistani sports.              
	On the Oldham Evening Chronicle blog, Parveen has stimulated a lively debate. Its fair to say she will have been of a better standard than some, was one observation.        
	Another considered her a breath of fresh air! though there was not much leniency shown for anything (at all) down the leg-side!        
	It was not clear whether this was an example of Northern humour.

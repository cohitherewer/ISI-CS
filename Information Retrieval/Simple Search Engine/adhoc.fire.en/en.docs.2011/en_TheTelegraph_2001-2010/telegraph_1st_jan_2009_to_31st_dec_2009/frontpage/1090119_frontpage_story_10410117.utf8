          G.S. MUDUR                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 18: The Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, plans to release soon Indias first-ever guidelines aimed at reducing complications and 30-day mortality among patients after cancer treatment.        
	The guidelines will prescribe preventive and corrective actions to tackle likely adverse events that cancer patients may experience after treatment with surgery, radiation or chemotherapy, hospital director Rajendra Badwe told The Telegraph.        
	The guidelines, to be finalised at a special annual meeting of top Indian and foreign cancer specialists on February 27 and 28, will be distributed to medical colleges and nearly 150 private hospitals and clinics across the country, he said.        
	The health ministry estimates that India has about 700,000 new patients with cancer each year and about 1.5 million are in need of diagnosis or treatment at any point in time. We want the management of cancer to be, as far as possible, uniform across the country, Badwe said.         
	The treatment guidelines are being released after a dynamic process the Tata hospital initiated in 2002. Guidelines released in previous years had covered treatment practices that could improve long-term survival in breast cancer, gastro-intestinal cancers, oral cancers and uterine cervical cancer.         
	This year, for the first time, were focusing on complications, Badwe said.         
	Some of the riskiest adverse effects occur within four weeks of therapy, Badwe said. The goal is to reduce both morbidity and mortality in the 30 days after treatment.        
	Cancer therapy is associated with a range of complications, from hair loss to changes in the immune system to death, after a surgical procedure.        
	One serious, and potentially fatal, complication can be failure of surgical fusion of tissues after surgery. A few years ago, this complication was observed to occur in about 15 per cent of patients who had undergone surgery of the oesophagus, a cancer surgeon at the Tata hospital said. But it (the complication) has been reduced to 5 per cent. This shows that appropriate practices can reduce the rate of complications, the surgeon said.        
	Doctors monitoring healthcare standards have long been arguing that standard treatment protocols need to be circulated among medical practitioners. The absence of such protocols for many diseases provides vast scope for doctors to self-determine how to treat their patients, said Amar Jesani, coordinator of the Centre for Study of Ethics and Rights, Mumbai.         
	Such protocols are a must. They will provide proper guidance to doctors, even educate them. And, above all, they will provide us a tool to judge the extent to which doctors are practising irrational care, Jesani said.        
	Badwe said the guidelines prescribed action in a hierarchical format: one set for urban hospitals, one for semi-urban institutions and another for rural centres. Such a division allows doctors in different institutions to act according to available infrastructure. But a hierarchy in guidelines will also enable policy-makers to determine the facilities that need to be added in poorly equipped clinics.

  Cong critics fall in line          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                                    
	New Delhi, July 29: Asked if Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had managed to silence the Opposition today, Rahul Gandhi said: He is always convincing.        
	Singh drew a long applause from the Congress with what was described as an extremely persuasive speech by party colleagues who were critical of the Egypt statement.        
	Over the past couple of weeks, the Congress had been polarised between those who opposed the statement and those who backed it.         
	The churning after the jo- int declaration with the US in July 2005 that led to the nuclear deal was being replayed with a difference: at that time, those who saw merits in the memorandum of understanding were vocal from Day One. The dissenters covertly disseminated their reservations.        
	This time, Singhs opponents were a little less discreet. Whoever met them came away with the impression that the critics were unhappy with the Prime Minister because he had not consulted the Congress while effecting what some described as a paradigm shift in Indias Pakistan policy and ignored senior ministers and the bureaucracy.         
	Some leaders who did not make it to the ministry also took the opportunity to take potshots at the Prime Minister.         
	Asked if they had taken up the matter with the Congress president, the opponents said she would have to keep the Maharashtra elections in mind because the last big terror strike happened in Mumbai.        
	All the while, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul were figuring out the statements implications for themselves. Sources said they were told that in Maharashtra, which goes to polls in September, what mattered was how effectively the Congress-NCP alliance worked on the ground and used Raj Thackerays Maharashtra Navnirman Sena to its advantage.        
	Rahul was convinced that each time Singh challenged the certitudes the party clung to, he faced problems from the status quoists.        
	The party had criticised his economic reforms when it lost the 1996 polls but now celebrates it as a path breaker. Sonia and Rahul realised he was attempting to snap out of the frozen mindset on Pakistan and thinking in an unorthodox way. Perhaps they thought if he was willing to take the risks inherent in such a move, they should support him all the more, a source said.        
	An imponderable in the script is another terror attack. If that happens, Singh will have to revisit his peace blueprint, the source said.        
	Pak reaction        
	Pakistan Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani has reciprocated the sentiment for peace expressed by Singh, saying dialogue is the only way forward for the two countries.        
	Gilani commended Singh for his bold vision of peace and prosperity in South Asia and the statesmanship that he has demonstrated.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | No holidays for leaders: Poll

          JOHN C. FREED                            Merkel: Opinion divided                                  
	Paris, June 26: As the global economic crisis heads into the summer vacation season, westerners have some advice for their political leaders: Keep on working.        
	Even people in Spain, Italy and France, famous for jealously guarding their vacation time, strongly agreed with that sentiment in a new survey conducted by Harris Interactive for the International Herald Tribune and the cable news channel France 24.         
	By a ratio of two to one, people in those countries as well as the US and Britain said their leaders should reduce or eliminate their vacation time this year in response to the economy. Germans were split on whether Chancellor Angela Merkel should take her normal time off.         
	The opinions about national leaders reflected sentiments within each country. In Germany, for instance, about half of those surveyed said the economy would have no impact on their vacation plans. In the other five countries, one-third of the respondents or fewer said so.        
	One of the respondents who agreed to a subsequent interview, Sam Muir of Bracknell, England, wrote in an email message that he and his family would take their normal two-week vacation and that if anything, Prime Minister Gordon Brown should take a longer one.         
	I believe him taking a shorter break could be worse, as he will be around to impose more of his madcap schemes upon us, Muir said. His initial reaction with the financial stimulus package to sort out the banks was good for the short term, but he is deliberately hiding the cost of his ongoing spending plans and plunging the country into debt.        
	On average, people are looking at spending about 15 per cent less time on vacation this summer. The highest average is in Spain, with 14 days off, down from 17.3 last year, a decline of 19 per cent. Americans have the fewest vacation days, averaging 5.8, a decline of 20 per cent from last year.         
	I think Americans are overworked and, in many cases, cannot afford to take a summer vacation, another respondent, Tammy Andrew of New Ipswich, New Hampshire, said.        
	She added that her husband recently found a job after many months of unemployment and was not even eligible for time off.         
	We will take a weekend or afternoon here and there during July and August to go for a hike, visit a museum, catch a minor league ball game or camp overnight, but will not be able to take a summer vacation involving multiple days, she said. Europeans seem to have figured out that rest and relaxation are necessary for happy employees.

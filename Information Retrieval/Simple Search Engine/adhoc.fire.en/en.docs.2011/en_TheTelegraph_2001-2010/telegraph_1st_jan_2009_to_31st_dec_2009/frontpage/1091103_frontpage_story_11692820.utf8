          MUZAFFAR RAINA                              
	Srinagar, Nov. 2: A scientist has joined the scores of Kashmiris prevented from visiting China because of a stapled visa.        
	Shakeel Ahmad Romshoo, an associate professor at the University of Kashmir, was stopped by Indian immigration authorities at New Delhi airport on Saturday from travelling to Beijing, where he was scheduled to receive an award today.         
	I was virtually offloaded. I was cleared by immigration only after I could convince them that I was receiving a high-profile award. But they had some afterthought and I was informed at the eleventh hour that I cannot board the aircraft, said Romshoo, who is with the universitys department of geology and geophysics.        
	The scientist said the reason he was stopped by immigration officials at Indira Gandhi International Airport was the stapled visa issued to him by the Chinese embassy in New Delhi. China disputes the citizenship of Kashmiris holding Indian passports and issues visas on a separate document that Indian immigration authorities refuse to accept.        
	The 44-year-old scientist was to receive the Kasumigaura International Award for his work, Pollution Modelling of Himalayan Lakes, at the 13th World Lake Conference in Beijing. Romshoo got his doctorate in space technology and remote sensing from Tokyo University.        
	Scores of Kashmiris have been prevented from travelling to the neighbouring country in recent weeks after China started issuing a stapled visa to people from the state instead of a printed one. India sees the move as Chinas acceptance of Kashmir as a disputed territory.         
	I was scheduled to fly on China Southern Airlines two days ago to receive the award, which includes a cash prize of US$5,000, a medal and a citation, he said, pointing out that he has travelled to 30 countries, including China, in the past, but has never faced such a problem.        
	The scientist said he later took up the issue with the Chinese embassy and was told that the visa was valid despite Indias protests. The issue is adversely affecting business and career prospects of hundreds of Jammu and Kashmir citizens, Romshoo said.         
	Two other Kashmiris wanted to board the flight. Though I got a boarding pass, they were not even given that, he said. Romshoo said he had informed the organisers in China about the development. I expect them to send the award by post now.

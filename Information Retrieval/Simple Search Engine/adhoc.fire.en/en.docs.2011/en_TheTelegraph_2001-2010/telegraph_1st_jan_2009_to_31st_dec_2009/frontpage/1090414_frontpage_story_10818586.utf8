	New Delhi, April 13: Infants exposed to two languages gain select high-level brain abilities earlier compared to babies from single-language households, says a new European study that scientists say is relevant to Indias multilingual milieu.         
	Researchers at the International School for Advanced Study in Trieste, Italy, have found that a multilingual environment enhances infants abilities connected to the mental tasks of discrimination, directing attention and error detection.         
	The gains in cognitive abilities may be emerging from the challenge that infants encounter when they have to discriminate or process two languages, said Jacques Mehler, professor of cognitive neuroscience at the Trieste school.        
	The study suggests that perceiving and processing sounds from two languages even during the first few months of life may improve specific cognitive abilities before the onset of speech.        
	These cognitive gains could become apparent in infants only seven months of age, Mehler told The Telegraph. The findings will appear this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.         
	Mehler cautioned that the results should not be interpreted to suggest that infants from multilingual environments turn out smarter than infants from single-language homes. The study spotted gains in only a small set of brain abilities.        
	It is also possible that infants from single-language homes will pick up similar capabilities over time through other challenges that they encounter, such as discriminating between toys, he said.         
	In their experiments, Mehler and co-worker Agnes Melinda Kovacs provided audio and visual cues to multilingual and monolingual infants, and tracked eye movements as the infants looked for a reward  coloured puppets with a tinkling sound.        
	Earlier research studies had shown that habitual use of two languages could improve cognitive abilities in young adults, school-age and pre-school children. The Italian study extends the observation to infants.        
	The findings are very relevant to India where more and more infants are being brought up in bilingual homes or where very young children are exposed to more than one language, said Akila Sadasivan, a child neuropsychologist in Bangalore. Parents sometimes worry whether it is okay to expose their infants to two or more languages, she said. There was a belief that exposure to multiple languages could delay language development.

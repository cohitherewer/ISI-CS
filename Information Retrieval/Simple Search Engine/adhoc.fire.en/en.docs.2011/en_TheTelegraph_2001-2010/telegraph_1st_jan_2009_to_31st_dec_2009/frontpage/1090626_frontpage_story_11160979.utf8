The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Under the sky a month after Aila
                                                                                                           Under the sky a month after Aila
          ZEESHAN JAWED                             Water accumulated in a Sunderbans village flows into a dam damaged by the Aila. Amit Datta                                   
	Calcutta, June 25: The cyclone had swamped their land and blown away their homes. A month on, thousands still live under the sky in Aila-swept Sunderbans.        
	And every sunrise means a fresh ordeal because high tides flood villages twice daily despite chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees assertion during his visits to the cyclone-hit areas that repairing embankments would be his administrations top priority.        
	Bengal irrigation minister Subhash Naskar conceded that there had been little progress in repairing the breached embankments since the cyclone struck on May 25.        
	Around 1,200km of the 3,500km-long embankment in the Sunderbans got swept away because of Aila. We have been able to do some work on 40 per cent of the embankments but that is not permanent. We have just been able to put some support by using bamboo poles and soil-filled sacks, Naskar said.         
	Irrigation officials say about Rs 1,400 crore would be needed to repair the embankments and paucity of funds was one of the biggest challenges facing the state government, which asked for Rs 1,000 crore for rehabilitating the Aila-affected villagers of the Sunderbans.        
	Till now, the Centre has released Rs 100 crore and sources in the state government said the amount was insufficient to carry out proper relief work.        
	The Union ministry of water resources has constituted a task force to assess the damage to the embankments and suggest remedial measures. A decision on the amount of money needed for the repairs will be taken after the task force submits its report, said a source.        
	But money is not the only constraint, Naskar agreed.        
	We have not been able to convince a single contractor or agency to take up the embankment repair work, he said, admitting that whatever repairs could be carried out was only because of the villagers.         
	The Sunderbans are staring at eight more spring tides (bhora kotal) this year, and Naskar didnt have a clue to how the government would tackle the situation.        
	If repairing breached embankments is turning out to be a big bother, the district administration is still trying to figure out how to ensure peoples livelihood and provide them with drinking water and a roof over their heads.         
	As both farmlands and fisheries got flooded with saline water, the government will have to help people involved in these vocations. A detailed rehabilitation plan has to be prepared, said Tushar Kanjilal of the Tagore Society for Rural Development, an NGO working in the area for over 50 years.         
	A senior district official told The Telegraph he was not aware of any such plan being worked out. It seems the developments in Lalgarh have taken the focus away from the Sunderbans, he said.         
	The official said the Gosaba block office had prepared a detailed report on Ailas effect on homes  40,195 were destroyed and 6,672 were partially affected  to distribute compensation among the villagers.         
	The report was sent two weeks ago but we are yet to hear anything from Writers Buildings, he said.         
	So, living under the sky is still the only option for thousands.        
	I fled the day after Aila struck and decided to go back after the worst was over. But I dont know how long it will take for things to get back to normal, said Biswajit Mirdha, a resident of Bagnapara on Kumirmari island.        
	Kanjilal said the public health engineering department used to supply piped drinking water in Gosaba block. But the entire pipeline got damaged and it hasnt been repaired yet.        
	The failure to provide clean drinking water has resulted in an outbreak of diarrhoea in several parts of the Sunderbans. The hospital run by the Tagore Society has registered over 11,000 cases of severe diarrhoea in the past three weeks.

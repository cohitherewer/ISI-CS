          SUJAN DUTTA                            Mamata at a rally in Calcutta on Sunday. Picture by Amit Datta                                         
	Genteel CPM activist Abdul Rehman Khan is cut short in this colony of zari workers at his village, Goja, in South 24-Parganas Diamond Harbour constituency. He is explaining why business is bad these days.         
	Why, after the terror strike in Mumbai, orders are running low from Burrabazar and from the five-star hotels.        
	Oh, just shut up, an indignant worker interrupted. Enough of your speech. Just what have you done to get us some relief? Get lost.        
	Times have changed, says Khan, a soft-spoken man hurt by the rude behaviour. CPM workers were used to more reverential treatment. But now his party affiliation goes against him, even here in Goja, a village we are directed to because the party office in Amtala cited it as an example of a village of Bengali Muslims who had gone the Trinamul way in the 2008 panchayat poll but has now returned to the party fold.        
	On the strength of that visit, and the public ire against the CPM that we experienced because we were being escorted by a partyman, the claim  that the village is back with the comrades  can be contested.        
	The public exhibition of ire against the CPM is a best-case scenario for the Trinamul-led alliance. Mamata Banerjee can ride the crest of mass emotion if anger substitutes organisation across East Midnapore, South and North 24-Parganas and Nadia.        
	Rarely have people been more vocal against the Left Front. Mamata does not have the organisation to harness this outburst of anger. For her, anger must overcome her lack of organisation. That translates into votes for Trinamul.        
	CPM leaders, such as Ratan Bagchi, the party convener for the Diamond Harbour Lok Sabha constituency, admit that people are more vocal but that this is very good for us. None but the CPM can boast a sophisticated party organisation and an electoral machinery to go with it.        
	It is the silence that we fear. The silence of the kind that was there before the 2008 panchayat elections or the silence that was there before the 1984 Lok Sabha elections, he adds.         
	In the 1984 Lok Sabha polls, the Congress won 16 of Bengals 42 seats in the aftermath of Indira Gandhis assassination.        
	Bagchi argues that with the kind of organisation the CPM has, it is able to address the dissent that was in evidence in the panchayat polls.        
	Trinamul finds this an unhappy state of affairs for itself. Without a booth-level organisation we have little hope, the partys candidate in Tamluk who lights up Mamatas eyes, Subhendu Adhikari, admits.        
	In Tamluk, East Midnapore, he concedes, his case is different. There has been a popular consolidation of Trinamul support through the Nandigram movement.        
	But the worst-case scenario is in West Midnapore.        
	In the villages here, says a local journalist in the district town, they say we have a choice between the party (the CPM) and the Committee (the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities).        
	That goes to show how irrelevant electorally Trinamul is in West Midnapore, Keshpur, in Ghatal constituency, being its worst-case scenario  where the CPM dominates the entire belt with such force that it is able to dictate who will vote and how.        
	It is also the example of a lack of organisation being unable to net the anger that seethes in the villages there where people still speak in hushed undertones against the CPM.        
	Anger and organisation compete for Mamatas attention, depending on where one has an upper hand over the other.        
	Across East Midnapore and the 24-Parganas districts  Mamata country with a stretch of the imagination after the 2008 panchayat elections  she has reason to hope that anger will overcome her lack of organisation.        
	For Mamata, the quotient of public anger has to increase in volume. Bishnupur West in South 24-Parganas held a promise of that. In the bypoll in February, Madan Mitra sprung a surprise victory. What is more, he also swung 8,000 traditional Left votes the Trinamul way. It is not enough for Mamata that a people angry with the Left Front should be angrier. It is important that more people are angry.        
	Before the elections and during the three-phase polling, one way of measuring that is whether the Trinamul-led alliance is able to structure the anger. The booth-level committees that Adhikari refers to show an effort to channel the anger. Even if the effort is limp, the alliance is benefiting because it is largely forced from the ground level.        
	Adhikaris booth-level committees for Trinamul were largely amorphous bodies, loose, undefined gatherings. In Diamond Harbour constituency where Somen Mitra, once Mamatas adversary and now her candidate, says: You have to understand that things are different this time  the anti-Left forces are united. Booth-level committees are coming up spontaneously.        
	There is some evidence of this in Goja, the village the CPM claims it has turned around. Zari worker Mazahar Khan, who says he will vote for the CPM because his family has always voted for the party, says things are a little difficult this time because they (the anti-Left forces) are all together now.        
	The Trinamul councillor in Maheshtala, Dulal Das, says a typical booth-level committee of the alliance in the urban areas comprises between seven and 11 workers. These would include at least two boys who would be election agents, one to relieve the other when voting actually takes place. Gone are the days when we could not ensure the presence of our election agents in booths, Das claims.        
	In Amtala, inside the electoral office of the CPM, Ratan Bagchi, rubbishes these figures. In many booths, Trinamul cannot even make sure that they will have election agents, he says.        
	The CPM booth-level committee, explains Aveek Lahiri, elder brother of the CPM candidate Samik Lahiri and party activist, comprises political and organisational workers drawn from voters of the locality where a booth is situated. The partys election agents are separated from this committee. The CPM booth-level committees task is to canvass for votes, urge voters to cast their ballot and join in the propaganda campaign.        
	If the booth-level committee is the basis of the famed/notorious CPM electoral machinery, collective indignation is what the Trinamul-led alliance wants to hurl.        
	There is the possibility that this election will be a no vote against the Left Front rather than a yes vote for Mamata, says a political scientist based in Calcutta. He does not want to be named.        
	Anger can take that shape. It is important not to devalue public anger. Had it not been for anger overcoming organisation, there would not have been a 1977 (the year Indira Gandhi was defeated after the Emergency), he adds.        
	It is this possibility that petrifies the CPM. In Mathurapur, the constituency bordering Diamond Harbour, party workers admit we have made mistakes, there were problems in our rank and file but we realise that and we have said sorry to people.        
	A contrite CPM is an image that is new to Bengal and is most in evidence in this belt where Mamata hopes to make her biggest gains.        
	She did in the panchayat polls  in South and North 24-Parganas and in Nadia. She made whopping gains and the combined Opposition votes were more than that of the Lefts. The alliance and the anger pose a danger to the Left and its sophisticated election machinery the likes of which Bengal has never experienced before.        
	This cannot be a stalemated freeze of irresistible force meeting immovable object. Somethings gotta give.

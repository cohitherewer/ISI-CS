The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Singh in Bushs shoes
                                                                                                           Singh in Bushs shoes
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Hitesh Chauhan, who threw the shoe, being detained. (PTI)                                  
	Ahmedabad, April 26: The Prime Minister became the latest target of this election seasons footwear fashion when a young engineering student hurled a sneaker at him at a rally here today.        
	The shoe fell 20 feet short of the dais, from where Manmohan Singh was outlining his governments achievements.        
	Hitesh Chauhan, 21, had been sitting in the front row, some 60-70 feet from the dais, peppering Singh with jeers such as: How long will you politicians fool us?        
	When Congress workers asked him to shut up, the computer-course student got up and launched his shoe. He was immediately overpowered by security and was being questioned by police this evening.        
	Singh looked distracted for a moment but continued with his speech. He later told state Congress leader Shaktisinh Gohil not to lodge an FIR since he had forgiven the attacker.        
	The police said Hitesh wanted cheap publicity but state Congress spokesperson Arjun Modhwadia claimed he was an activist of BJP student arm ABVP and had been sent by his political masters.        
	Hitesh, an Ahmedabad resident, allegedly told the police that attending political rallies was his hobby. He apparently said he wanted the instant fame that a shoe throw brings.        
	Singh is the third world leader to witness a shoe hurled at him. Last year, then US President George W. Bush was targeted at a Baghdad news conference, and last February, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao was attacked at a Cambridge University lecture. Each time, the thrower missed.        
	The Congress said todays incident reflected the BJPs hate culture and demanded an apology from chief minister Narendra Modi. This is reflective of the law and order situation in the state. Modi should apologise, Congress media cell chief Veerappa Moily said in Delhi.        
	The BJP pointed out that home minister P. Chidambaram had faced a flying boot in Congress-ruled Delhi, but condemned todays incident saying: It is not part of democratic politics.        
	Three Indian politicians  Chidambaram, Congress MP Naveen Jindal and L.K. Advani  were attacked earlier this month but none took a hit.        
	Modi, nevertheless, has chosen to cut out all risk by addressing rallies from behind a two-foot-high plastic net even in his home state.

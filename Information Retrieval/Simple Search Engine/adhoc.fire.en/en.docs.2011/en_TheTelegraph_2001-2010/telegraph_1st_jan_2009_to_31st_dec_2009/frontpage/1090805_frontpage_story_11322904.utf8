The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Education right scales last big peak
                                                                                                           Education right scales last big peak
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 4: India today took the last big legislative step required to gift millions of its children the fundamental right to demand subsidised elementary education from the government, ending a 72-year-long wait to fulfil a dream of the father of the nation.        
	The Lok Sabha this evening passed the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Bill despite concerns raised by MPs from across the political spectrum.        
	Once notified  the process involves a chain of bureaucratic steps  the law will hand citizens a legal tool they can use against the government, its officials and school authorities who prevent a child aged between 6 and 14 from receiving and completing elementary education.        
	This is a revolutionary step that will help our children walk ahead with their heads held high. This is for our future, Kapil Sibal, the human resource development minister, told the House.        
	Nodding vigorously and thumping her desk in agreement was Sonia Gandhi, seated next to Sibal. Sonia had only yesterday quizzed the HRD minister on concerns raised over the bill.        
	Mahatma Gandhi had first spoken about the need for universalisation of elementary education in 1937.        
	The bill was passed by the Rajya Sabha earlier in this Parliament session, eight years after a constitutional amendment that made the right to education a fundamental right pending a law for its implementation.        
	Parliaments sanction for the landmark law triggers a chain of bureaucratic procedures that must be completed before children and their parents can hope to practically benefit from it, officials said. The law is implementable only after notification.         
	The human resource development ministry and the Finance Commission need to finalise the funding required to implement the law. The norms for sharing the financial burden between the Centre and states also have to be evolved. For this financial year, the Centre will need to obtain Parliaments sanction for revised budget allocations.        
	The law requires states and the Centre to set up a slew of agencies responsible for implementation and monitoring.        
	Only after all these procedures are over can parents and children really hope to successfully enforce the right to education, a senior official said. But today is a day to celebrate. This is a champagne moment, the official added with a smile, minutes after the bill was passed.        
	During the debate, several MPs drew attention to inadequacies voiced by educationists and civil society groups.        
	Hyderabad MP Asauddin Owaisi  a UPA ally  accused the coalition of reneging on its pledges towards minorities and violating a Supreme Court order. The right to education bill does not exempt minority institutions from a 25 per cent quota for the disadvantaged.        
	Article 30 of the Constitution grants minorities the right to start and manage educational institutions without government interference except in cases of corruption. The UPA, in its first term, had used this article to exempt minority institutions from OBC quotas in higher education.        
	Almost every member who spoke felt that the bill should have included children below 6 and till 18, instead of restricting its ambit to elementary education.        
	The Biju Janata Dals Tathagata Satpathy criticised the absence of any specific measures to convince children working for a living to join school. Quoting Jamaican reggae legend Bob Marley, he said: A hungry man is an angry man.        
	Former cricketer Kirti Azad (BJP) said the government was effectively demanding a blank cheque from Parliament by seeking approval for the bill without making its financial implications clear.        
	What happens if the norms that the Centre devises for sharing finances with states are unacceptable to some states which are poor? What happens to the bill then? he asked.        
	Responding to concerns raised by Jayaprada on the provisions for differently abled children, Sibal said the government would ensure that such students benefited from the 25 per cent quota. This, he said, will be specifically articulated in the rules.        
	Satpathy and the CPMs Saidul Haque accused the government of rushing the bill to claim success in its first 100 days.

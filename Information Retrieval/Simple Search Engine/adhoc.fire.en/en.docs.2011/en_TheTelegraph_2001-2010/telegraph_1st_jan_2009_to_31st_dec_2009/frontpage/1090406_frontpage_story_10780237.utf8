          JON PARELES                                              McCartney and Starr perform in New York. (AP)      
	New York, April 5: The surviving half of the Beatles came together here last night, with a little help from their late Indian friend, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.        
	Paul McCartney was headlining Change Begins Within  a benefit concert for the David Lynch Foundation  and Ringo Starr was also on the bill. It was clear something was up when McCartneys band appeared onstage with a second, empty drum kit set-up.        
	McCartney let the anticipation build with an exuberant set of songs from the Beatles, Wings and his solo albums. He then said: At this point we would like to introduce somebody to you who you know, youve heard his name. Hes going to come out here and play you a little song this joyful night. Ladies and gentlemen: Billy Shears!        
	Shears, of course, was the fictional character mentioned in the title song of the Beatles album Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band and, implicitly, as the singer of With a Little Help from My Friends  actually sung by Starr, the bands drummer.        
	And there was Starr onstage to sing the song, sharing a microphone with McCartney and embracing afterward.        
	What cause could summon that elusive event, a more-or-less Beatles reunion? Peace, human rights, poverty, AIDS, the environment? Well, no, it was transcendental meditation  invented by the Maharishi  which the David Lynch Foundation supports teaching to a million students at its schools. McCartney deepened that connection by unveiling a song, Cosmically Conscious, which he had written during the Beatles 1968 sojourn to the Maharishis ashram in Rishikesh.         
	Maharishi would always say he wanted everyone to be cosmically conscious and hed do his little giggle, McCartney reminisced. Hed also say, Its such a joy.        
	The lyrics went: Come and be cosmically conscious, cosmically conscious with me/Its such a joy joy.        
	Although the Beatles Rishikesh trip ended in disarray, Starr and McCartney prized their meditation mantras and have said they continue to use them. Starr wasnt done after the one song with McCartney. As the concerts entire line-up  including Donovan, Sheryl Crow, Eddie Vedder, Moby, Bettye LaVette and Ben Harper  filled the stage, Starr took his place at the second drum kit.

                                                                                                           Abducted railway engineer rescued
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Guwahati, Aug. 26: Security forces today rescued abducted railway engineer Sanjay Kumar Lama from a village, 3km north-east of Batasipara in Sonitpur district.         
	Inspector-general of police, northern range, S.N. Singh, said Lama was in good health and has been reunited with his family.         
	Lama, 43, was abducted from Batasipara under Dhekiajuli police station where he had gone to supervise the construction of a bridge on August 8. He was whisked away by four youths suspected to belong to the Ranjan Daimary faction of the NDFB.         
	The outfit had demanded Rs 1.5 crore and suspension of operations by security forces in the area for his release. Police claimed that no ransom was paid.         
	After tracking mobile calls between the abductors and Lamas family members and even railway officials Rangapara and Dhekiajuli, the police traced their location and the area was cordoned off with the help of the army, Assam Rifles and the CRPF on Monday evening.         
	This morning around 9.30, six to seven search parties were deployed to comb the area, Singh said. He said one of the teams found Lama abandoned at a village in the forest area near Batasipur. The abductors had fled leaving Lama behind after realising that the police were closing in, he said.         
	During the 18 days in custody, the abductors had shifted Lama from one place to another. Only recently, security forces raided a makeshift camp located on a hilltop near the place from where the railway engineer was rescued today. But the camp was abandoned just before the police team could reach there.         
	After the abduction, an inter-state alert was sounded and a joint operation by the police, the army and paramilitary forces was launched on the north bank of the Brahmaputra and Arunachal Pradesh.         
	A police source at Dhekiajuli said the abductors could not sneak into Arunachal Pradesh with the hostage as the border was sealed.         
	The Ranjan Daimary faction of the NDFB of late has stepped up its subversive activities in Sonitpur district.         
	Only last month, it triggered a powerful blast killing an army colonel and his driver in the district. The police said the outfit has also served extortion demands to several businessmen and tea gardens located in the district forcing several traders to flee.

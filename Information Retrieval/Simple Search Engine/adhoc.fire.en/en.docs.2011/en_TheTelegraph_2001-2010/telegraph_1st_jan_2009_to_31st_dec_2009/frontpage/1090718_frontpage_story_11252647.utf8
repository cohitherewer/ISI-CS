	Calcutta, July 17: A government that had started its stint with the slogan of Do It Now has adopted as its undeclared policy Dont Do Anything Now.        
	From the besieged hills of Darjeeling to bandh-bound Calcutta, the government appears to be unable, or even unwilling, to act. Chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti explained the position thus: The government has to weigh the pros and cons of every administrative action. The costs of such action will have to be considered too. If police march into a troubled territory and fire at people, theres always the chance of some innocent people getting killed. In that case, the government has to face the music. So the administration has got to be patient.        
	It seems its patience has such longevity that the administration will stand and watch public property being burnt one after another, which happened yesterday when so-called Congress supporters torched buses, and will do nothing to protect private property either.         
	In Broad Street in south Calcutta, a group of bandh supporters ransacked two eateries for daring to open their doors. Mohammad Rafique, the owner of one, said: I told them that all the food we made last night was perishable but they threw it away and broke my earthen stoves.        
	There were three of them (police) but they just stood aside and watched. What kind of protection is that? he asked.        
	When citizens dont feel secure in a situation there is a description for it: collapse of law and order and, by extension, of government. In such circumstances, resigning is an option, the one Mamata Banerjee wants Delhi to force on Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.        
	The CPM, however, is hoping  just as the administration is  that merit lies in being patient, that the Opposition will dig a hole for itself and creep in.        
	CPM state secretary Biman Bose said: Let the people realise who these elements are and what their real character is, when he was asked why the administration had failed to stop the Oppositions acts of vandalism he had listed.        
	That the official party line is to wait and watch and hope for the best became evident at the CPM state secretariat meeting this evening. The peoples recent mandate (Lok Sabha polls) didnt empower us to take strong action to ensure peace and normality. Let voters now judge the worth of those they have invited to replace us, a secretariat member said.        
	Bose said: The lawlessness of the last two days underlined the advent of the forces of anarchy of the seventies.        
	The chief secretarys helpless comment today demonstrated the governments surrender to these forces of anarchy. Having promised yesterday that publicly owned buses would run during the bandh, he was reduced to apologising: I am really sorry for people who left their homes today because of my assurance.        
	The CPM and its government have their compulsions in not causing conflict with the Congress because hope lies in encouraging distance between that party and its new ally Trinamul. But Citu, its labour wing, helped implement the bandh by calling a transport strike of its own ostensibly in protest against the torching of state buses.        
	If the Citu was protesting, the administration was expressing fear. The result was the same: the absence of transport. Sumantra Chowdhury, transport secretary, said: Yesterday, so many buses had been damaged and set on fire. So we decided not to bring out state transport buses today. There was insecurity.        
	When a government itself is afraid, can it protect citizens? A senior home department official said: What will happen to law and order and public security? Public property is being damaged or being set ablaze. Political killings are being reported from the districts. The government is in no mood to act and is a mere spectator. If this is the trend, people will go berserk at every minor provocation.        
	They are: from Nandigram to Lalgarh to Sealdah and Howrah.        
	The policy of Dont Do Anything Now goes back to when Mamata blockaded a national highway for a fortnight. It led to the Tatas walking out.        
	If that is the lesson, continuation of this strategy till the 2011 Assembly polls, as many have come to expect, could provoke voters into doing something.

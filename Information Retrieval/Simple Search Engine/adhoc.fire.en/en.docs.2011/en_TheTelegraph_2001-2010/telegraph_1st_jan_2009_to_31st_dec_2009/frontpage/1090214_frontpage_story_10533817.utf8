	Jaipur, Feb. 13: On the day of love, Ram will be pitted against Parashuram.         
	The Rajasthan chapter of the Sri Ram Sena, whose boss Pramod Muthalik was taken into preventive custody this evening in Karnataka, has warned couples against venturing out of home on Valentines Day tomorrow.         
	If they do, couples should be prepared to confront its activists armed with mangalsutras and rakhis. The activists would either force the couples to exchange rakhis or get married, the outfit warned.        
	But young lovers appear to have found their protectors in the Parashuram Sena, an organisation that carries out social work in the state.         
	The organisation, named after the sixth avatar of Vishnu who in mythology had to accept Rams superiority, has vowed to protect the couples. It has announced that at least 350 of its activists would fan out across Jaipur to keep vigil and come to the rescue of couples being harassed.         
	Mitroday Gandhi, the state president of Parashuram Sena, said: We will be ready to confront the Sri Ram Sena activists and beat them if we find them harassing youngsters. We do not want violence but if they create trouble, we will surely not sit back and watch one cannot remain passive any more.        
	Gandhi said his organisation, which conducts mass weddings, helps dowry victims and carries out welfare work, had decided to take on the Ram Sena because there is a limit to everything.         
	Where are they when marriages break down because of dowry demands? Have they ever campaigned against illicit liquor or provided succour to blast victims? Instead, they want to strike out at innocent people over flimsy reasons. We will not allow this to happen this time, Gandhi said.        
	State Ram Sena chief Kishore Singh said he was not aware of the Parashuram Sena.         
	Our fight is not against love but against the onslaught of western culture. Why do we have to embrace a non-Indian festival, we have enough Indian ones to celebrate love. We would advise young couples not to venture out of home.        
	Even if they do, our men will advise them not to exchange flowers and chocolates as a first warning, asking them to gift each other on any other day. Our first targets will be restaurants and pubs. If they do not relent we will ask them to choose between mangalsutra and rakhi, whichever they prefer.        
	Reports said Ram Sena workers had been given lathis and told to keep watch.

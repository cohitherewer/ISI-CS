The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Leicester lights up for once-unwelcome Indians 
                                                                                                           Leicester lights up for once-unwelcome Indians 
  - Diwali extravaganza illuminates how attitudes have changed since the flight from Uganda in 1972          AMIT ROY                            Diwali lights on Belgrave Road, Leicesters golden mile                                         
	Leicester, Oct. 6: As 6,500 Diwali lamps strung 1,000 metres along Belgrave Road were switched on in Leicesters golden mile on Sunday night, the contrast with 1972 could not have been more dramatic.        
	Then, 30,000-35,000 of the 90,000 Indian refugees expelled by Idi Amin from Uganda had flown into a cold, windswept Britain, with the majority making their way to the East Midlands city of Leicester despite appeals from the Leicester Mercury and the unwelcoming Leicester City Council not to do so.        
	At 7.30pm on Sunday, priest Dilip Doshi recited Sanskrit shlokas as the lights were switched on to loud cheers. Back in Gujarat, from where many of the Indians have come, mostly via Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania and Malawi, it would have been the midnight hour.        
	The Queens representative, Jennifer, Lady Gretton, the Lord-Lieutenant for the County and City of Leicester, spoke of the deep spiritual meaning of Diwali, before handing over to Leicesters Lord Mayor, the Right Worshipful Councillor Roger Blackmore, who read out his greetings in phonetically-written Hindi.        
	Keith Vaz, who has been Leicester Easts MP since 1987, declared: We are a unique city. There is no other city like it in the world.                     Indian refugees arrive from Uganda in Britain in 1972      
	His wife, Maria, who was up on stage with her children, Luke, 14, and Anjali, 12, after the local girls had done a Jai Ho turn from Slumdog Millionaire, said later: From the stage, you can see a sea of faces going down Belgrave Road  I could not see where it ended.        
	Estimates for the crowd varied from 20,000 to 60,000. How many? mused a policewoman. A lot!        
	Today, the Leicester Mercury is no longer the racist newspaper it admits it once was, employs Asian journalists and provides sympathetic coverage of the citys ethnic minority population.         
	As for the Leicester City Council, which is twinned with Rajkot in Gujarat, 18 of its 54 councillors are Asians belonging to the Hindu, Muslim and Sikh faiths.        
	The prediction is that within a few years, more than half the citys population, currently edging close to 300,000, will belong to the ethnic minorities. Figures are a little vague but Hindus reckon they number between 65,000 and 70,000, Muslims total 28,000-30,000 and the Sikhs around 20,000.        
	Ugandas loss has transformed the British economic landscape.        
	Ross Willmott, leader of Leicesters Labour-controlled Council who has been to India on a trade delegation to seek investment, told The Telegraph that things have changed hugely (since 1972). A lot of Leicesters prosperity has to do with the influx from Uganda.        
	No one has done a proper survey but one resident, Sunil Morjaria, said over a masala chai and a samosa at the Thali that the number of Indian jewellery, food, grocery, sari, garment, travel shops and other stores on Belgrave Road and its extension, Melton Road  they were visibly in a state of decay before 1972  easily exceeded 300.        
	Apart from a short break, the Diwali lights will come on every evening until well into the new year. The Alliance amp; Leicester building society is contributing 40,000 of the 70,000 it will cost.         
	The lights are on from dark until midnight every day. The Councils proposed energy saving with a 10.30 switch-off has been waived for Diwali.         
	These are the biggest Diwali celebrations outside India, said Ramanbhai Barber, the president of the Shree Sanatan temple, about the lights which have become bigger and brighter with each passing year and reflect how well Leicester is doing. They will be switched off for a couple of weeks at the end of November but come on again a fortnight before Christmas and stay on till mid-January. The Diwas are replaced with stars.        
	Leicesters temples are places for worship, gossip and business. Earlier on Sunday, at the Shree Sanatan Mandir, for example, Barber received a number of councillors, community leaders and John Townsend, the vice-president of the Leicestershire Chamber of Commerce who had taken a couple of trade delegations to India.        
	Leicester has not escaped the effects of the recession but people are carrying on business much as usual, said Townsend. It is a large community of small Asian businesses  knitwear, clothing, apparel, packaging. Having family businesses makes it easier for them to pull together. Lots of businesses are still very successful.        
	He would be happier, though, if Indian businesses made more of an effort to employ whites.        
	Some white people would have preferred a statue of the former footballer Gary Lineker, who once played for Leicester City, rather than of Gandhi, which is behind bars and needs security.

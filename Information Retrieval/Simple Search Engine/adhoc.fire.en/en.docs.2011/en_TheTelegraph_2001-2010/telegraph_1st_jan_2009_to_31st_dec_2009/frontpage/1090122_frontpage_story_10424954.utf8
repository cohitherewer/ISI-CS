	Washington, Jan. 21: The US Constitution is clear that the 35 words of the oath of office must be spoken exactly before a new President can execute his powers.        
	Which is what makes the oath President Barack Obama took so interesting. Because of a noticeable gaffe by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr, Obama transposed the words.        
	He should have said he will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States but instead said he will execute the Office of President of the United States faithfully.        
	Constitutional law experts agree that the flub is insignificant. Yet two previous Presidents  Calvin Coolidge and Chester A. Arthur  repeated the oath privately because of similar issues.        
	Lawyers said Obama and his supporters need not be worried about the legitimacy of his presidency, but they also said a do-over couldnt hurt.         
	Charles Cooper, head of the Justice Departments Office of Legal Counsel under President Ronald Reagan, said that an incorrect recitation should be fixed and that he would be surprised if the oath had not already been re-administered.        
	Jonathan Turley, a professor of constitutional law, said: He should probably take the oath again. (But) I dont think its necessary, and its not a constitutional crisis. This is the chief justices version of a wardrobe malfunction.

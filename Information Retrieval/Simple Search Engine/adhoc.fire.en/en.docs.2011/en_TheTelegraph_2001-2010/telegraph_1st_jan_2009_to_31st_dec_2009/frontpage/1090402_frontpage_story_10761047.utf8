The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Dispur seeks peaceniks help
                                                                                                           Dispur seeks peaceniks help
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Guwahati, April 1: Ulfas pro-peace group may help security forces with news on rebel movements in the run-up to the elections after Dispur sought the factions help to boost security arrangements.        
	Though the talks group, which declared ceasefire in June last, has sworn never to train their guns on their former colleagues, the killing of a peacenik last week appears to have brought about a change of heart.        
	Besides, they wish to barter their help for a positive response from the government on their charter of demands.        
	Dispur said it has indeed sought support from the pro-talks group of Ulfa and also other groups in ceasefire to help bolster security arrangements.         
	A source in the home department said help has been sought from the former rebels to provide information regarding militant movements.         
	Since these cadres have come overground only recently, they have more information than security personnel, a senior home official said.         
	Confirming the home departments request, a leader of Ulfas pro-talk group said there was nothing official about it but senior police officials had been contacting the leadership seeking help.         
	We are thinking of helping security forces on condition that the government will reciprocate positively towards our demands, he said.         
	The group recently placed a charter of demands before Prime Minister Manmohan Singh through chief minister Tarun Gogoi. The demands include full autonomy for Assam within the framework of the Constitution.         
	The assassination of pro-peace leader Robin Gogoi in Sadiya last week also changed their minds about their former colleagues.        
	Although the killers have not been identified, the pro-talks group claimed that an Ulfa leader had admitted to having awarded a death sentence to Gogoi and executing him.         
	We are thinking positively about helping security forces in counter-insurgency operations because Ulfa has started attacking our cadres. We cannot remain a mute spectator, the leader of the pro-talks group said.         
	Home department sources said cadres of the pro-talks group, especially from the 709 battalion, would be of great help to security forces since the battalion has been quite active till recently.         
	About 60 cadres of the pro-talks group, mostly hailing from the 709, are currently staying at a designated camp at Nalbari.         
	We are not very concerned about Upper Assam, since most of the dreaded cadres have become a part of the pro-talks group. We are concerned more about lower Assam, where quite a few cadres of the 709 battalion are still very active, the home department official said.

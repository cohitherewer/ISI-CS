                                Mark Zuckerberg, Facebooks founder, has tightened privacy controls on the site                            
	London, Dec. 7: Panic buttons may be installed on social networking sites to enable children to alert website operators when inappropriate material is posted on the sites.        
	Some 140 firms and other groups are considering Internet standards drawn up by the governments adviser on online safety, Tanya Byron.         
	The groups would act as a consultative group to the networking site on issues related to online safety.        
	The panic button system is similar to one that the networking site Bebo has already announced and involves a prominently displayed means for children to report offensive, obscene and other inappropriate material. The standards should also give parents greater control over childrens use of the Internet with controls that enable them to prevent access to pages with offensive content. Sites will also have to offer a safe search service that stops children from inadvertently accessing unsuitable sites.        
	According to research by industry regulator Ofcom, about 35 per cent of children are able to access the Internet in their bedrooms without parental supervision.        
	The Sunday Times reported that Ed Balls, the schools secretary, and Alan Johnson, the home secretary, would unveil the voluntary code tomorrow and that British Prime Minister Gordon Brown might also attend the launch.        
	Websites which are moderated by staff are the focus of the new guidelines, particularly Internet chatrooms, search engines and instant messaging services.        
	Further details are being working on by the UK Council for Child Internet Safety and these are due be published next summer.         
	The government also plans to launch an advertising campaign about using the Internet safely. Parents will be advised to keep computers in areas where they can monitor their childrens use.

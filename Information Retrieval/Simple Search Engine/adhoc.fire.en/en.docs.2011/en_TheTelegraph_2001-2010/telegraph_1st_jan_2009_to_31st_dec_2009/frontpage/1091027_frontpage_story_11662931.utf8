          BISWAJIT ROY                            Atindranath Dutta, the police officer taken hostage and released by Maoists, being helped out of a jeep by another officer (not in picture) to be debriefed at Bhabani Bhavan, the CID headquarters, in Calcutta on Monday. Based on Duttas nearly six-hour account, the CID is making portraits of Maoist leader Kishanji and the woman who led the Sankrail raid.

	Calcutta, Oct. 26: The Centre may defer a planned anti-Maoist offensive because of differences in the Congress and the partys preoccupation with the November-December elections in Jharkhand, CPM sources have quoted chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee as telling his colleagues.        
	A CPM central committee source said Bhattacharjee had learnt this from Union home minister P. Chidambaram during their weekend meeting in Delhi.        
	Chidambaram, though, assured the chief minister that the central forces numbers in Lalgarh would not be reduced because of the Jharkhand polls, the source quoted Bhattacharjee as telling a Left Front meeting today.        
	The source said: Chidambaram has aired a lot of sound bites on his planned offensive to mount pressure on the Maoists and build public opinion. But we got the message that the crackdown will not start before the Congress resolves its internal differences on how to deal with (the rebels).        
	The Prime Minister recently spoke of a holistic approach to the Maoist threat with an agenda for inclusive growth, apparently to accommodate the concerns of Rahul Gandhi who has said the rebels thrive in areas where the government has failed to deliver. Party leaders such as Digvijay Singh have publicly differed with the crackdown-first-development-later policy attributed to the home ministry.        
	CPM leaders said Chidambaram had earlier hinted that the decisive campaign would start after the October 13 polls in three states to leave enough time till Presidents rule expires in Jharkhand on January 18.        
	Presidents rule would have facilitated the central forces action. But the Congress has decided to sail in favourable weather after winning the polls in three states, a CPM leader said.        
	Chidambaram and Bhattacharjee have, therefore, agreed to keep up the pressure on the Maoists, the CPM sources said. In this context, the sources drew attention to the chief ministers statement that he would teach them (the rebels) a lesson.        
	The Jharkhand polls end on December 18, after which the offensive could start unless unforeseen events force the Centre to advance the operation.        
	Some CPM leaders fear that the Congress and the JMM may strike local-level deals with the rebels before the elections, which could hinder security operations in Jharkhand, crucial for containing the Maoists in Bengal.        
	In Bengal, the joint forces campaign will continue, CPM state secretary Biman Bose said.        
	The Maoists efforts to drive a wedge between the CPM and its allies came to the fore today when RSP minister Kshiti Goswami said Kishanji had called him up three months ago. It prompted Bose to quip he hoped Goswami had reported the matter to the chief minister.        
	Kishanji also contacted CPI minister Nandagopal Bhattacharya this month and wrote to Bloc leader Ashok Ghosh recently, other sources said.

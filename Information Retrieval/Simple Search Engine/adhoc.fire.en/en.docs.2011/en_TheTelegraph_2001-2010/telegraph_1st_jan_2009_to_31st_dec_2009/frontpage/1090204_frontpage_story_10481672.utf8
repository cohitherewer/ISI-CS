          G.S. MUDUR                             Efficiency scan                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 3: The search for terrorists through profiling on ethnic or community-based identities is flawed and unlikely to be more efficient than screening entire populations, a new mathematical analysis has shown.         
	A statistical model developed by a computational biologist in the US has shown that profiling by ethnicity or nationality is an inefficient way to catch a potential terrorist and no more likely to identify a potential perpetrator than random screening.         
	His research was aimed at analysing the efficiency of secondary screening  the process often followed in airports in which some individuals are selected from a large group for detailed baggage scrutiny and personal search to a greater degree than others.         
	Despite the social and ethical controversies triggered by ethnic or racial profiling, its effectiveness at identifying possible terrorists had remained unexamined.         
	Now, William Press, a professor of computer sciences and integrative biology at the University of Texas, Austin, has used a mathematical approach, first developed to search for gene sequences, to analyse the mathematics of profiling.         
	His research shows that strong profiling is no more efficient than uniform random screening because of repeated selection of the same individuals potentially at every security checkpoint.         
	Our tolerance of profiling comes from our being told that it makes us significantly safer by somehow siphoning off the most dangerous people, said Press. But this calculation shows that if you do this, you are actually less likely to find the terrorist.         
	The catch efficiency through profiling is lower because the terrorist might happen not to be in the highest profiled group and because you are wasting resources on repeated testing of innocent individuals, Press told The Telegraph.         
	His study, published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, might rekindle the moral and ethical debates on whether profiling based on ethnic or national identities is worth the social cost at all. The mathematics could actually lead one to a decision not to profile at all, Press said.         
	Virtually everyone has to undergo primary screening  passing through metal detectors and having their baggage screened through an X-ray machine. But security agencies in several countries are believed to be using profiling strategies based on ethnic, racial or national identities to select individuals for secondary screening. The secondary screening is often visible in airports.         
	Press has shown that a different strategy called square-root based sampling that distributes the screening more broadly may reduce unnecessary, repetitive screening and allows effective use of scarce security resources.         
	Square-root sampling lies in between the options of selecting an individual who fits a profile more often than the average passenger and of not applying the profile at all, and picking an individual only as often as average.

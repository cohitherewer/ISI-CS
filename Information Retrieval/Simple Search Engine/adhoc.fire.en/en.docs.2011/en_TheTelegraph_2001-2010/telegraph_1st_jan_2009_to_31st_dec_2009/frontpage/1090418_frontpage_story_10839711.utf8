          KATE DEVLIN                            good for heart                                  
	London, April 17: Laughter really could be the best form of medicine  because it is good for the heart, a new study shows.         
	Doctors found that they could potentially cut the risk of people suffering a heart attack by encouraging them to watch comedy programmes.         
	Patients prescribed the mirthful laughter went on to increase the amount of good cholesterol, which protects against heart disease, in their blood stream.         
	The researchers say that the findings could point to laughter as a useful treatment for a number of conditions. Lee Berk, from Loma Linda University, California, who led the study, said: The best clinicians understand that there is an intrinsic physiological intervention brought about by positive emotions such as mirthful laughter, optimism and hope, he added.         
	Using laughter as a form of medicine has been suggested for decades. However, there has been little hard evidence of its health effects on patients. For the latest study, patients were asked to select whichever comedy programmes or films that they found the funniest.         
	There were then asked to watch them for at least half an hour a day over the course of 12 months. The findings, presented at the Experimental Biology conference in New Orleans, show that after one year the group prescribed laughter saw a 26 per cent rise in their good cholesterol. The findings show that after one year the group prescribed laughter saw a 26 per cent rise in their good cholesterol.         
	Patients who took the medication without any extra laughter had just a 3 per cent rise. The group watching comedy programmes also saw a drop of 66 per cent in the amount of harmful C-reactive proteins, which increase the risk of heart disease, in their bodies.

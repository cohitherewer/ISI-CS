	Chandigarh, Jan. 31: Five newborn babies were burnt alive in a state-run Punjab hospital when the incubators they had been kept in caught fire early this morning minutes after their mothers had fed them.        
	The two girls and three boys, all between three and seven days and under treatment for jaundice, were among 10 infants admitted to Patialas Rajindra Hospital.        
	Two of the babies were injured while three are safe. One injured infant has been referred to the PGI in Chandigarh, hospital superintendent Surinder Singh said.        
	Patiala police chief Gurmeet Singh said initial investigations pointed to a short-circuit.        
	Police sources said they were looking into the haphazard electrical wiring inside the unit and whether the incubators were being maintained properly.        
	The door to the room was also believed to have been locked from outside, leading to a delay in rescuing the infants.        
	Hospital authorities said the fire broke out around 3 when very few employees were on duty. Relatives of patients admitted to the hospital helped rescue the other infants by breaking open the incubators and taking the babies out wrapped in blankets.        
	It was just five minutes earlier that my wife had fed our daughter, said Manjit Singh. There were some noises like crackers bursting. By the time we could reach the room, five children, including my daughter, had perished.        
	Sanjay, an eyewitness, said flames were leaping out of the incubator room. At first, no one went inside. But when someone shouted there were infants inside, some of us rushed in and broke the glasses of the incubators to get the infants out. Getting inside the room was frightening with flames touching the roof. Even breathing was difficult.        
	Some of the rescued infants had glass splinters on them, Sanjay added.        
	Chief minister Parkash Singh Badal has ordered a magisterial probe. The government has announced a compensation of Rs 1 lakh for the families of the dead infants.

          OUR BUREAU                                    
	Silchar/Guwahati, May 30: Police today arrested the chief executive member (CEM) of the North Cachar Hills Autonomous Council, Mohit Hojai, for allegedly paying Rs 1 crore to two persons for purchasing arms for a militant outfit.         
	The cash was recovered from the duo in Guwahati nearly two months ago.        
	R.H. Khan, a liaison official of the district council and a former deputy director in the social welfare department, was also arrested along with Hojai from Halflong in the wee hours today.        
	The police remained tight-lipped on the CEM after he was brought to Guwahati.         
	Sources said Hojai had been kept at an undisclosed location and would be interrogated in connection with the recent recovery of Rs 1 crore from Brojen Hojai and Babul Kemprai.         
	The duo were arrested from the Assam-Meghalaya border in Guwahati on April 2. They were travelling in a Scorpio vehicle when the police intercepted them in the Jorabat area.        
	Apart from the cash, two small weapons and stationery of the militant Dima Halam Daogah (Jewel Garlosa), were also recovered from their possession.        
	The duo alleged that the CEM had given them the money to purchase weapons for the DHD (J) from an international arms dealer.        
	The police said they managed to gather vital clues regarding the involvement of international arms dealers who supply weapons to the militant outfits of the Northeast, from the arrested duo.         
	Chief minister Tarun Gogoi today ruled out a ceasefire with the DHD (J) if it did not abjure violence and surrender arms.        
	When asked as to whether the NC Hills Autonomous Council would be dissolved, Gogoi said it needed to pull up its socks, otherwise it would face appropriate action. The council has been facing allegations of diversion of funds to the coffers of militant outfits.        
	Hojai, 50, had gone underground for over two months after the incident, but surfaced in Haflong town last month in a dramatic manner and took charge of the council.        
	The police said the arrest was aimed at uncovering the money trail from government departments and district council coffers to the militant outfits, particularly the DHD (J).        
	Hojai will be produced in a court in Guwahati tomorrow.        
	Official sources in Haflong, the district headquarters, said Hojai had been escorted to Guwahati by the police in a convoy early this morning.         
	A police team from Guwahati reached Haflong around 3am and after arresting Hojai rushed back to the capital city by 5am.Sources said Hojai had paid the amount (Rs 1 crore) to the DHD (J) as protection money.               
	The state cabinet on Saturday evening authorised chief minister Tarun Gogoi to take appropriate action vis-a-vis NC Hills Autonomous Council to streamline its functioning and restore normalcy in the disturbed district. The development suggested that the council could be dissolved anytime given the all-round pressure from Centre to get things back to normal at the earliest. A source said the councils fate would be known by tomorrow. Raj Bhawan sources said they have not received any recommendation from Dispur vis-a-vis NC Hills but quot;tomorrow quot; is another day, adding to the suspense. The Cabinet was also briefed about the new Guwahati master plan. It cleared a few cases pertaining to service rules.

	Jamshedpur, Nov. 19: At least three people were killed and 40 injured when a Maoist-triggered blast caused eight coaches of the Tata-Bilaspur passenger train to derail near Posaita station, 120km from the steel city, on the Jharkhand-Orissa border, this evening.         
	Senior railway officials said rebels blew up a portion of the tracks between Manoharpur and Posaita, which led to the derailment. The train had left Manoharpur in West Singhbum at 9.15 pm.         
	Reports said three of the eight derailed coaches of 321Up Tatanagar-Bilaspur Passenger were badly damaged. Intelligence sources said three bodies had been recovered.        
	Senior divisional commercial manager of Chakradhapur railway division Vivek Srivastava said: Relief trains have been rushed from Rourkela and Chakradharpur.         
	A medical van left for the accident site from Tatanagar at 10.40pm. A special train carrying West Singhbhum SP Akhilesh Kumar Jha and DRM, Chakradharpur, Ravindra Gupta to the site was, however, forced to a halt by another blast near Mahadevshal station around 11pm.        
	The incidents occurred hours before a Maoist-sponsored bandh starts in Jharkhand. Security has been beefed up at all the stations in Chakradharpur division. Movement of trains on the Howrah-Mumbai line has been hit.        
	In a separate incident, two can bombs, one weighing 25kg and another 35kg, were recovered this evening from Tamba village in Khunti.

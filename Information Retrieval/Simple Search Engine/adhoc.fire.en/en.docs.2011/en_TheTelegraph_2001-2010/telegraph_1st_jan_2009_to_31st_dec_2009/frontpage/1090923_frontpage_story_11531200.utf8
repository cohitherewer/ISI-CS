  - Trinamul minister exits dais graced by state duo; CPM leaves Puja space for rivals         OUR BUREAU              LOOK WHO'S NOT SMILING            Trinamul minister Mukul Roy (standing with file) on the dais a few feet from CPM ministers Nirupam Sen (centre) and Asok Bhattacharya.

	Calcutta, Sept. 22: A Trinamul Congress central minister today stunned a business chamber by leaving the dais of its annual general meeting because of the presence of two CPM ministers.        
	But Meera Bhattacharjee, the chief ministers wife, denied Trinamul leaders the pleasure of a repeat walkout by staying away from a favourite Puja in north Calcutta.        
	Mukul Roy, the Union minister of state for shipping and a close aide of Mamata Banerjee, was designated the chief guest at the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BNCCI) meeting this afternoon. The 122-year-old chamber represents many small and medium industries.        
	Bengal industries minister Nirupam Sen and urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya were on the dais when the Union minister appeared 30 minutes after the meeting had started.        
	Roy went up to the dais, received a bouquet and sat down beside BNCCI president Sandip Sen. On the left of Sandip Sen were Nirupam Sen and Bhattacharya.         
	Within minutes, Roy got up and left the hall. Later, an announcement was made that the central minister had left on an urgent call.         
	But word soon spread that Roy had left because of a little-known Trinamul decision not to share a platform with CPM ministers or leaders at private events.        
	The Union minister later said the chamber meeting fell into the private category and he was not told that CPM ministers would be present.        
	The organisers said they did not mention the identity of the other participants when the minister was invited because confirmations came in late and Roy did not specifically ask for such information.

	However, BNCCI chief Sandip Sen said Roy was told the two state ministers were waiting when a call was made to the Union minister at 12.15pm.        
	I called the Union minister and said the other ministers had arrived and whether we should start the meeting. Roy said to go ahead and he would join later. So I began the programme, Sandip Sen said.        
	Roy contested this version. The chamber never told me that the two state ministers were already there. Why will I go after learning about the presence of CPM ministers and then walk out?        
	He added: Todays BNCCI programme was a private one and not a government one. Hence, there was no question of maintaining protocol by staying put even if I didnt want to. When I was invited, I had asked whether anybody else was attending and they replied in the negative.        
	Business circles, however, termed the walkout immature and childish. Politicians are failing to rise above petty issues for the larger cause of the states development, said an industrialist.        
	It is not Bengals culture. The BNCCI presidents speech said Bengals problems would be heard more at the Centre as there is high cabinet representation. Is this the example? Bhattacharya asked after the meeting.        
	We have worked with so many governments at the Centre. Most of the time, the Left parties were in the Opposition. But we never had a problem, Nirupam Sen said.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee seized the opportunity to stress co-operation for development. In a letter to be read out tomorrow at the annual general meeting of the Merchants Chamber of Commerce, the chief minister said: The state government seeks support and co-operation from all concerned for all-round development of West Bengal.        
	Puja push        
	If Roy exited the business dais, the CPM gave a walkover  or robbed Trinamul of a chance to walk out again  by staying away from the Puja platform.        
	The Manicktala Chaltabagan Lohapatty Puja was inaugurated today without the usual presence of Meera Bhattacharjee and CPM leader Mohammad Salim.         
	They decided not to come so that the Puja organisers were not faced with an awkward situation, and maybe even a walkout by the Trinamul MP, said a source.        
	Local MP Sudip Bandopadhyay of Trinamul held centrestage at the Puja. Pujas are getting politicised these days. Till last year, this was Md Salims Puja. When the organisers came to invite me this time, I told them I would only come if they promised to ensure that Md Salim would not be there, Bandopadhyay said.

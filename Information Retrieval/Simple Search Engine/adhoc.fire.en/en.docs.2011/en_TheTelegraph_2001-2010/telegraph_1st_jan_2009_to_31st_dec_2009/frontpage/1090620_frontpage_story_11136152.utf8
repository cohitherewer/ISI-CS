          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Kohima, June 19: The great show of unity by warring Naga factions early this month has been dismissed by a top militant leader of the Khaplang faction, who ruled out any possibility of reconciliation as long as Isak Chishi Swu and Thuingaleng Muivah continued peace talks with Delhi.        
	Kughalu Mulatonu, the emissary to the collective leadership of the NSCN (K), said: Reconciliation and unity is impossible till Swu and Muivah are in dialogue with the government of India.         
	Between June 2 and 7, the warring Naga groups met for the Covenant of Reconciliation at Chiang Mai in Thailand and signed a joint declaration to resolve all outstanding issues among themselves for an early solution to the nearly 65-year-old Naga political imbroglio.        
	The covenant was signed by chairman of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim Isak Chishi Swu, chairman of National Socialist Council of Nagaland S.S. Khaplang and president of the breakaway group of Federal Government of Nagaland, S. Singnya.        
	Mulatonus dismissal of the rapprochement effort came amid fears that hardliners in the Naga militant outfits may derail the peace agreement.        
	The Khaplang emissary claimed that the Centre had invited the NSCN (K) for talks to resolve the protracted Naga political issue.         
	Mulatonu, who is currently in Delhi, said the NSCN (I-M)s proximity to the Forum for Naga Reconciliation, led by Baptist preacherRev. Wati Aier, was an airy-fairy drama and cautioned the Naga people of the evil that lies beneath the fangs of the rival group.         
	Singson Kuki, one of Mulatonus comrades and foreign kilonser (minister) in the NSCN (K), however, said the common desire of the people is for reconciliation and unity between Naga groups.         
	But the paradox is, there are still hardliners in both the NSCN groups who have become a barrier in the process, said Kuki, who was part of the Naga reconciliation meet at Chiang Mai.         
	Without taking any names, Kuki said, Some people in both the groups dont want reconciliation, which is against the wishes of the Naga people.         
	Kuki, however, said the NSCN (I-M) must come out with a clear picture of the ongoing talks with the Centre to avoid mistrust and doubts.         
	They should come out with the details about the talks, he added.         
	He admitted that there was a larger mistrust among Naga groups notwithstanding the covenant of reconciliation and these have to be cleared cautiously.

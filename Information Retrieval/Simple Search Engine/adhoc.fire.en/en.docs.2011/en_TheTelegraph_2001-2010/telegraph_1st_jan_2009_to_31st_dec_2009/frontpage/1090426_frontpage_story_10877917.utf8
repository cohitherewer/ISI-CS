          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Rahul in Calcutta. (Pradip Sanyal)                          
	Calcutta, April 25: Rahul Gandhi today ruled out becoming Prime Minister if the Congress returned to power, saying he was not experienced enough.        
	He continued his criticism of the Lefts performance in implementing rural schemes, and compared parts of Bengal with Orissas Kalahandi and the heartlands Bundelkhand  areas known for extreme poverty, backwardness and migration.        
	At his news conference here, several of the questions related to the way certain Congress lobbies were projecting him as the candidate for Prime Minister.        
	I would refuse for two reasons. One, I am working on the Youth Congress organisation as I believe that a pro-poor youth wing is required in our country. We have got results in Punjab and Gujarat and I will try to set up elected bodies of the youth wing in every state, Rahul said. Secondly, I dont think I have the experience to become the Prime Minister of our country right now. I am just a party campaigner.        
	Rahul, flanked by foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee and the Congress general secretary for Bengal affairs, K. Keshava Rao, was asked if he was being projected as the next Prime Minister since he belonged to the Gandhi family.        
	Is Manmohan Singhji a part of the Gandhi family? Whether its anybody from the Gandhi family or from outside, my feelings and principles about what I say will remain the same. It so happens that I belong to the Gandhi family, Rahul said.        
	On Bengal, he took up from where had left off yesterday, when he had said the situation in the state was far worse than in Uttar Pradesh. Today he said: I was shocked to see the status of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme work in Purulia. Lakhs of job cards have been issued but families are not getting work.        
	I find no difference between Purulia and Kalahandi, or for that matter with Bundelkhand. UP has caste dynamics, violence and lots of things. I dont think Bengal can be equated with UP. The ground situation here should have been better.        
	Rahul added: If there is an allotment of Rs 100 crore for housing, 50 per cent is remaining unspent. If we (the Congress and the Left) end up joining each other (after the polls), my views will not change as the ground reality wont change.        
	Asked directly whether the Congress might keep its door open for the Left after the polls, he would not be drawn.        
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee dismissed Rahuls statements as those of an immature politician. He needs to educate himself more before commenting on Bengal. Before equating Purulia with Kalahandi, he should know the difference in the ground realities of the two districts and what is the per capita income of local people there, the chief minister said.

	Calcutta, April 20: They look aggrieved at the question but know it is being asked. The Bahujan Samaj Party candidates from Bengal deny that their Lok Sabha candidature was bought with cash.        
	No, no! The question doesnt arise. The allegations are baseless and insulting, said Ashok Sonkar, BSP candidate from Barrackpore and a resident of Howrahs Malapara.        
	The question about a price tag attached to BSP tickets is underpinned by several smaller queries: Why would a party field candidates in all 42 seats in a state where it never polled even one per cent of the votes? Why are most of them affluent businessmen?        
	And then: How many of her candidates would Mayavati recognise when she arrives tomorrow to address a rally near the Shahid Minar?        
	Ten of the 42, apparently, had met Mayavati when she came to Calcutta in 2004 and 2005 and one of them, Ramavatar Gupta, is a party veteran of 23 years and has met her many times.        
	Gupta, contesting from Howrah, was asked if his ticket came at a price. Absurd question. The answer is, No, said the retired marine engineer from Shibpur who has travelled to 100-odd countries.        
	Dum Dum candidate Dulal Chandra Das, a telecom engineer who retired as a general manager with Calcutta Telephones, said: I cant comment on this. Behenji has instructed us not to flirt with controversy.        
	Allegations, however, have come from various parts of the country about BSP tickets going for as high as Rs 75 lakh.        
	Shailesh Varma, candidate from Sagar in Madhya Pradesh, quit the party on April 7 to join the BJP alleging the BSP high command was selling tickets. Earlier, Gayadin Ahirwar, BSP candidate from Tikamgarh in the same state, was expelled for alleging the leadership had demanded Rs 25 lakh from him.        
	The Telegraph asked the partys Bengal leadership if the allegations were indeed baseless.        
	Youre digging for unnecessary controversy, a senior party official smiled, sitting in his 15-foot-by-10-foot ground-floor chamber in the party headquarters at Sodepur.        
	The two-storey buildings outer walls are painted an electric blue, Mayavatis party colours. So is most of the furniture. Five party activists are busy sorting flags in a corner.        
	Dada, the BSP has no realistic chance in the state. Why would anybody pay to contest? an activist asked. He was promptly asked to leave the room.        
	Is it a coincidence that more than 50 per cent of BSP candidates are affluent businessmen?        
	Yes, a simple coincidence, the official said.        
	Sonkar, who came from Mirzapur in Uttar Pradesh, said his sons ran flourishing businesses in agricultural products and saris. He had joined the BJP in 1994 and became vice-president of its Scheduled Caste morcha in Bengal. What prompted the sudden, pre-poll switch?        
	Joining the BJP was a mistake; it doesnt do anything for the SCs. I want to have a role in the development of the SCs and want to see Behenji as the next Prime Minister, Sonkar said.        
	Doesnt the switch have anything to do with his chances of getting a ticket? No, not really, Sonkar said.        
	The BSP has an explanation for fielding so many candidates  it wants to increase its vote share to try and retain its national party status. But what do the candidates gain from near-certain routs?        
	No poll contestant will ever acknowledge this, but the tag of Lok Sabha candidate -- even a failed one  can boost ones prestige and influence, at least in ones immediate locality. Its a bonus that few, let alone businessmen, can ignore.        
	Some of the BSP candidates may even have reasoned that with Mayavati almost certain to wield immense clout after the polls  no matter who comes to power -- they would be in a position to gain.        
	In the 2006 Assembly polls, the BSP had fielded candidates from 128 of the 294 seats. All lost their deposits and the party polled 0.70 per cent of the votes. In the 2004 Lok Sabha polls, it had fielded 38 candidates and won 0.21 per cent of the votes.        
	The party has set a target for its candidates, a senior leader said: Try and get 5-10 per cent of the SC/ST votes to make a difference in poll equations.        
	Among Mayavatis 42 candidates this time, 37 are SCs, one is an ST and three are Muslims, with only one from outside this group. The Scheduled Castes make up 23 per cent of Bengals population. In the 10 Lok Sabha constituencies and 68 Assembly constituencies reserved for them in the state, they had generally voted Left for the past three decades.        
	Mayavatis biggest rival, the Samajwadi Party, is fielding 10 candidates in Bengal. Many are Muslims and nearly half are businessmen. State president Vijay Upadhyay, a businessman from Uttar Pradesh domiciled in Bengal, said the party was putting up candidates to prove our political existence.        
	Actors Sanjay Dutt and Jaya Bachchan will address three Samajwadi meetings in Birbhum, Krishnagar and Howrah on April 26.

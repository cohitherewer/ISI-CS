                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                KSU disrupts holiday exam 
  - Invigilators slapped, papers snatched        OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Shillong, Dec. 30: The Khasi Students Union today roughed up invigilators and forced cancellation of the BTech fifth semester examination at Nehu to protest against the test being conducted on a state holiday.        
	The KSU took umbrage as the examination was being held on the death anniversary of Jaintia freedom fighter and martyr U Kiang Nongbah. The day is observed as an official holiday in Meghalaya.         
	Police said a group of KSU volunteers barged into three centres at Nehu to stop the BTech examination, barely 15 minutes after it had started at 9.30am. Nearly 120 students from the Northeast were taking the exam.         
	The KSU volunteers, who reached the Nehu campus in three local taxis, entered the examination halls, snatched away question papers and answersheets from the examinees and tore and burnt the same after coming out of the halls.         
	They also roughed up the invigilators, who were all faculty members of Nehu. Some examinees alleged that the activists slapped an invigilator and caught another by the collar after an altercation in the presence of the examinees.        
	Expressing concern over the incident, the staff blamed the universitys authorities for conducting the exams on an official holiday.         
	The Nehu authorities had fixed the BTech exam for today after it was cancelled in the first week of December because of the agitation by teachers following the cancellation of the hills area special allowance.         
	Nehu vice-chancellor Pramod Tandon told this correspondent that the examination has been postponed following todays incident. We regret holding of the examination on a holiday. This happened because of a communication gap, he said, adding that the students would not suffer as the examination had been rescheduled.         
	Asked whether Nehu had lodged any official complaint, Shillong (city) superintendent of police Claudia Lyngwa said the university had just informed them that KSU volunteers were behind the incident.         
	The Nehu authorities had not informed us that they were holding the examination today. The Nehu has separate private security guards and they were unaware about the entry of the KSU activists, Lyngwa said.

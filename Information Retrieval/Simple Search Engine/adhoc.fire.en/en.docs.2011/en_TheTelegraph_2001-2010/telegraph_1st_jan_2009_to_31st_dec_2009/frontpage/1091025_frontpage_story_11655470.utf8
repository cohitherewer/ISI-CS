          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Shillong, Oct. 24: A homeguard today foiled a jailbreak attempt in West Garo Hills district of Meghalaya by firing at a gang of undertrials, injuring one as another made a suicide bid to evade arrest.         
	The 13 undertrial prisoners of Tura Jail, however, were not as lucky as the gang of seven led by Full Moon Dhar that pulled off a sensational escape from Shillong Jail on May 31.        
	On finding that the warders were out to collect firewood, the undertrial prisoners crossed over to the jails outer ring  that houses the offices of the jail staff  through the small gate around noon today, police said.         
	The gate to the outer ring was open and the prisoners overpowered the two warders who were on duty at that main gate.        
	On hearing their cries for help, the homeguards posted in the watchtowers came rushing. One of them shot at the gang, injuring Gamseng Sangma who sustained bullet injuries in his right leg.        
	The scared prisoners quickly entered the inner ring and hurried to their cells. One of them, Uttam Sangma, stabbed himself in the stomach to avoid being caught.        
	 He is accused of killing his pregnant wife Nirupa and dumping the body in a cashewnut plantation at Gambegre, 12km from Tura, in February this year.         
	Gamseng is a member of Atong Liberation Army and was arrested from South Garo Hills in May this year.        
	The injured duo were rushed to Tura Civil Hospital. Their condition is stable.        
	A total of 183 prisoners, including a woman, are lodged in Tura Jail. Of them, 58 are convicts and the rest undertrials.        
	The deputy commissioner of West Garo Hills, Sanjay Goyal, ordered a magisterial inquiry. Goyal said additional district magistrate, T.G. Momin, had been asked to complete the probe within a week.         
	Goyal said a preliminary inquiry report had ruled out the involvement of any jail staff or prolonged planning by the prisoners.        
	The spurt in incidents of jailbreak prompted the jail department to order a departmental inquiry.         
	The police are also conducting a separate probe into the incident.        
	The inspector-general of police (law and order), B.L. Buam, who is in Tura on official duty, has completed a preliminary inquiry into the incident. Buam said the report had been submitted to the authorities concerned for necessary action.

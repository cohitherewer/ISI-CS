  - Friend burns boy to death after a minor argument at their mess           OUR BUREAU                                          
	Dimoria/Guwahati, Sept. 8: A first year student of Dimoria College was doused in kerosene and burnt to death by his friend and sophomore from the same college after an argument over a T-shirt yesterday.        
	Nitumoni Das apparently went to Prafulla Dass room at Sankargog, about 30km from Guwahati, yesterday, following which they quarrelled bitterly over a T-shirt Prafulla wanted to borrow.        
	When Nitumoni refused to part with the T-shirt, Prafulla poured kerosene on him and set him on fire.        
	The first-year student succumbed to his wounds at Dispur Hospital in Guwahati around 10.30pm.        
	 Before he expired, Nitumoni told his mother, Moon Das, that Prafulla set him on fire after he refused to give him his T-shirt, a police official of Khetri police station said.         
	When the incident took place, Maram Boro, who is Prafullas roommate and also a second year student of Dimoria College, was also present. We are investigating whether he is also involved in the crime, the official said.         
	Prafulla is absconding and a hunt has been launched to arrest him.         
	Maram, however, surrendered before police this morning and is being interrogated at Khetri police station.         
	The police have recovered liquor bottles and cigarette packets from the room and it is suspected that the boys may have been drunk.         
	Incidentally, it was Maram and Prafulla who rushed the victim to Gauhati Medical College and Hospital in an ambulance, the police official said.         
	The victims father, Anil Das, said Prafulla called them up around 4pm and informed them that Nitumoni had met with an accident and asked him to come to Gauhati Medical College and Hospital.         
	Prafulla and Maram disappeared from the scene soon after the victims parents arrived at the GMCH.         
	The police have registered a murder case at Khetri police station.        
	They also questioned three youths, Ashim Hira, Chandan Goala and Pallab Jyoti Nath, who live in rooms next to Prafullas.         
	The three said they rushed out of their rooms after they heard a cry and were shocked to see Nitumoni in flames.        
	They tried to douse the fire by wrapping a gunny bag around his body and also by pouring water but have no idea how he caught fire.        
	I know that my son will never come back. I wish that what happened to my son should not happen to anyone else, a grief-stricken Anil said.        
	I want a thorough probe into it, as there might be a bigger conspiracy behind the murder, he said.        
	Prafulla and Nitumoni were friends and Prafulla used to frequent our house. I cant believe that he could kill my son. Now I have left it to God and hope that justice will prevail, said the inconsolable mother.         
	The principal of Dimoria College, Ram Charan Bharali, said he was shocked to hear about the incident.         
	Based on the preliminary report about the incident we have received, both Prafulla and Maram have been expelled from the college, Bharali said.        
	Psychiatrist Jayanta Das termed the incident as a dangerous sign of unhealthy mental health in the younger generation.         
	Even though it will be difficult for me to clinically analyse the incident without knowing the causes and circumstances, it shows growing intolerance among us. It is also evident of erosion of value system, Das said.

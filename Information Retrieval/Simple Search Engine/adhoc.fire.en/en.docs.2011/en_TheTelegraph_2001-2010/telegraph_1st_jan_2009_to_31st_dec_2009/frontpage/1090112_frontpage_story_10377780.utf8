The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Name stalls school showpiece
                                                                                                           Name stalls school showpiece
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 11: Success, scorned once, is playing hard to get with Arjun Singhs ministry.        
	The governments biggest new education scheme, aimed at secondary schooling for all, is stalled because the human resource development (HRD) ministry had gone and changed its original name.        
	That name was Success, short for Scheme for Universalisation of Access to and Improvement of Quality of Education at Secondary Stage. The Union budget for 2008-09 allocated funds for the project under this name.        
	However, the ministry later dumped the English name for a Hindi one, renaming the scheme Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan before getting it cleared by the cabinet last week.        
	Despite the cabinet nod, however, finance department officials have misgivings about releasing funds for the scheme, The Telegraph has learnt. The governments finance arm is only authorised to release money sanctioned in the budget.        
	The budgeted money is for Success, not RMSA. Releasing money would mean funding something not provided for in this years budget, a finance official explained.        
	The HRD ministry had already fought a two-year war over the projects funding with the Planning Commission and the finance ministry before the cabinet approved the Rs 20,120-crore scheme.        
	After working for two years, staying up countless nights and battling with government colleagues to get the plan approved, it is names that are now holding us back, an official rued.        
	HRD mandarins have assured finance officials that the scheme would be cited as the RMSA in the next budget, and have requested the release of funds for the couple of months left in this financial year.        
	They are arguing that the matter is urgent: the general election is approaching and the poll panel may ban the implementation of any new scheme that could be seen as a sop.        
	Finance officials have scanned the cabinet note that proposed the RMSA  and was cleared by the countrys highest executive panel  to try and spot any mention of Success. They have only met failure.        
	However, earlier documents attached to the note as annexures do carry the acronym Success, which was coined by a former ministry official. The HRD ministry, sources said, is hoping to convince the finance officials that since the annexures contain the original name, the cabinet had enough clarity that the scheme approved as RMSA was actually Success.        
	Success was first announced in the 2007 budget speech by the then finance minister, P. Chidambaram. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had conceived the scheme as a lasting contribution by the United Progressive Alliance to the countrys efforts to improve education at the grassroots.

	Darjeeling, Feb. 15: The ABGL office here was ransacked this evening, the second time this year, and a garage with cars belonging to the outfits president Madan Tamang set on fire. The party has raised accusatory fingers at the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha.        
	Police said while one vehicle was burnt, another was partially damaged. However, Mohan Sharma, the general secretary of the ABGLs trade union wing, said over the phone from Siliguri that three cars had been completely burnt. Madan Tamang is in Nepal and the caretaker, Bikram Rai, called me up and gave me the details. The vehicles burnt were a mini-truck, a Land Rover and a Maruti Esteem, Sharma said. We suspect it to be a Morcha job.        
	On Friday, Tamang had said the Morcha should review its agitation in the plains, as it was not heading nowhere.        
	The garage is located along INA Bypass on the outskirts of Darjeeling town and is barely 400 metres from Tamangs residence. One fire tender had been sent to the garage to put out the flames.        
	At the party office on Ladenla Road in the centre of the town, a gang of 15 youths broke into the premises around 7.30pm. They tore out posters from the walls before setting them on fire along with documents and two benches.        
	Darjeeling police superintendent Rahul Srivastava said the attacks were simultaneous. The party office has been ransacked and one vehicle has been burnt. Another was damaged partially. We have started two cases, one at the Darjeeling Sadar and the other at Jorebungalow police station under whose jurisdiction the garage falls.         
	Asked about the policemen supposed to have been posted at the party office, Srivastava said he would have to check with the circle inspector to find out of there had been any changes in the duty roster.        
	The ABGL office was ransacked on January 1 too. The ransack had followed the lynching of Morcha leader Subodh Pradhan in Rohini.        
	Morcha general secretary Roshan Giri has denied the involvement of his party in todays incident. We have no time and interest in going after Madan Tamang. he said.

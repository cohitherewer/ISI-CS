The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Gogoi walks out of college
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Gogoi walks out of college
          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	Guwahati, Dec. 1: Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi today walked out of Jorhat Engineering College after students booed him during his speech.         
	The students also squatted on the road near the main gate of the institute not allowing Gogois convoy to leave and forcing it to make a detour.         
	An aide of the chief minister said Gogoi had promised not to return to the institute ever again. I was never insulted like this before, he quoted Gogoi as saying.         
	The students were protesting against the governments move to bring the two engineering colleges and polytechnic institutes in the state under the Societies Registration Act. The move would mean virtual privatisation of these technical institutions.         
	JEC principal Atul Bora said such an act by the students could not be accepted. The chief minister was our guest and the students should not have resorted to such tactics. There are other ways to protest.         
	Gogoi arrived at the institute at 10am to lay the foundation stone of a new building. After the ceremony, he was escorted to the dais. The gathering comprised mainly students of the institute.         
	Things were fine until the chief minister made a minor goof-up in his speech by referring to the Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) as Indian Institute of Technology (IIT). Every block in the state will have an IIT very soon, he said to boos and guffaws from the gathering.         
	Gogoi became angry but continued to put forward the governments proposal to privatise the engineering colleges and the polytechnic institutes soon. If the privatisation does not work out, we will change again to the present system, he announced before ending his speech halfway.         
	The JEC students became agitated over the chief ministers announcement and when he denied permission to the general secretary of the students union, Rajib Duori, to read out the copy of a memorandum, they gathered in front of the main gate and squatted on the road, not allowing the convoy to leave.         
	They demanded that the chief minister immediately announce that the move to bring the institute under the act be shelved. After several requests to the students to vacate the road failed, the security personnel took another route out of the institute before things could turn worse.         
	The JEC students were later joined by the students of Prince of Wales Institute of Technology as they marched to the circuit house shouting slogans against Gogoi before being stopped by security forces.        
	There have been protests from the students of the two engineering colleges and polytechnic institutions over the past fortnight over the governments move.         
	Rajib said over phone that the students were still in the dark about the governments move to bring the technical institutions under the Societies Registration Act.         
	We have to know what kind of changes would be there when this new move is implemented. Will the government completely stop funding the institutions? The government cannot take a unilateral decision on such a vital issue.         
	The principal of the institute said the faculty had not offered support to the government move.         
	Bora said the institute had received a letter from the directorate of technical about a fortnight ago, seeking its view regarding the move to bring the institute under the act.        
	Gogoi told reporters at the circuit house in Jorhat this evening that the move to bring the two engineering colleges and the polytechnic institutes under the Societies Registration Act had been initiated to give more autonomy to these institutes.         
	A delegation of students of JEC, led by Bora, met Gogoi at the circuit house later in the evening and expressed regret over the unfortunate incident.

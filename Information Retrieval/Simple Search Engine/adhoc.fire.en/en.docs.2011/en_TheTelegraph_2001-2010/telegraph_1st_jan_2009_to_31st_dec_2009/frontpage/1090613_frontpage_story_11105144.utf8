The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Amar abroad for treatment
                                                                                                           Amar abroad for treatment
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	New Delhi, June 12: Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh was flown to a hospital abroad this week for a kidney transplant.         
	Singh has been keeping unwell through the election campaign. His situation worsened in the past few weeks and he was shifted to Batra hospital here and then to the Dhirubhai Ambani hospital in Mumbai where he was under the care of nephrologists.         
	Both his kidneys are badly damaged and if there is no other element in his condition, there will be no problem after a transplant. There are no more details about his condition, said a government source. Whether the donor is Indian or from abroad is not known.         
	Former Prime Minister V.P. Singh survived with damaged kidneys for several years.         
	The venue of the surgery could not be independently confirmed. While some Samajwadi leaders said Amar Singh was in a Singapore hospital, others said he had been moved to a London hospital four days ago. A close aide said Amar Singh would be in a Singapore hospital for a month.         
	But a senior leader from Uttar Pradesh said: He will be in a hospital in London for a month and a half. Doctors will decide when the transplant will be done and then party leaders will visit him.        
	Transplant surgeons in India said it would be extremely unusual for a patient to consider having a transplant outside India because kidney transplants are routinely done in several Indian cities.         
	But its possible a patient who travels abroad for a transplant may have a perception that you can get better quality surgery there, said a transplant specialist.         
	Its also possible that in some countries, obtaining a kidney from an unrelated donor might be easier than in India, the doctor added. Indian laws make it difficult for a patient to take a kidney from an unrelated donor.

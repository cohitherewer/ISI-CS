The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Polls indicated a Congress victory
                                                                                                           Polls indicated a Congress victory
										                              
	New Delhi, Oct 22 (PTI): As trends indicated a Congress victory in all the three states which went to polls, AICC headquarters here reverberated with drum beats and bursting of crackers as party supporters started celebrating the 'win'.
    Impromptu dance to the tunes of drum beats by Congress supporters carrying party flags could be seen since morning in front of the headquarters on Akbar Road and the adjoining 10 Janpath, the residence of party President Sonia Gandhi.  
	The ruling Congress in Haryana won 11 of the 23 seats declared and led in 29 others, leaving INLD at the second spot with seven seats.  
	 INLD, which had yielded power to the Congress five years back, appeared set to improve its 2005 performance as the party was leading in 22 other constituencies. 	  
	Among the places where Congress registered its win are Hisar, Ambala city, Kaithal, Tosham, Garhi Sampla-Kiloi, Pehowa, Panchkula and Rewari. Prominent winners include Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and some state ministers.  
	 SAD led by Parkash Singh Badal will make its debut in the Haryana assembly with its candidate Charanjit Singh winning from Kalanwali defeating his nearest Congress rival Sushil Kumar Indora.  
	 BJP nominee Anil Vij, who was an Independent nominee five years back, was elected from Ambala Cantt defeating his nearest rival former Agriculture Minister Nirmal Singh by a margin of 6338 votes.  
	 BJP nominees were leading in three other constituencies even though the party after breaking its alliance with INLD had contested all the 90 seats.  
	 Independents have won three seats and were leading in five others while HJC-BL and BSP nominees were leading in five and three constituencies respectively.  
	 Haryana Congress President Phool Chand Mullana lost to Rajbir Barara (INLD) from Mullana by a margin of 2938 votes.  
	Congress today exuded confidence it will form the government for the third time in a row in Maharashtra and for the second consecutive time in Haryana, where the party is scrambling for numbers to get a majoirty.
    "Our government is being formed for the third time in a row in Maharashtra and second consecutive time in Haryana after 40 years. This is an achievement," AICC General Secretary B K Hariprasad told reporters here.
    Asked abut the party getting fewer seats in both the states, he said the government was being formed for the third time in Maharashtra. "Some anti-incumbency was there in both these states," Hariprasad said.
    To a query about the strategy of the party in Maharashtra if it fell short of the numbers, he said, "independents are in touch with state and central leadership".  
	By afternoon on Wednesday, the ruling Congress had won 22 Arunachal Pradesh seats and was leading in 12 others, enough to give the party its only clean sweep on Thursday.
    The party won three seats uncontested. Chief Minister Dorjee Khandu was declared elected unopposed from Mukto, besides Jambey Tashi from Lumla and Tsewang Dhondup from Tawang.

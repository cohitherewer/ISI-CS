          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 6: Four additional secretaries at the Research and Analysis Wing have gone on protest leave amid suspicion that plans are afoot to merge Indias external spy agency with its parent, the Intelligence Bureau.        
	The show of discontent comes after a 1975-batch IPS officer, Avdhesh Mathur, was recommended for the rank of director-general, superseding seven senior officers of the Research and Analysis Service, RAWs own cadre.        
	Sources said the superseded officers belonged to the 1973, 1974 and 1975 batches. The four disgruntled officers, they added, had conveyed their disappointment to Verma and cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar.        
	Mathur had been transferred to RAW in 2007 from the Intelligence Bureau (IB), the countrys highest agency for internal intelligence. After his promotion, he would become the second-highest ranked officer in the spy agency.        
	Although current RAW chief (secretary) K.C. Verma retires only in January 2011, sources speculated that the process of succession had already begun, with Mathur being promoted to clear the decks for him to become the next secretary. They said the promotion was ordered by the Union cabinets appointments committee.        
	Many see a pattern in this. Verma himself had been in the IB for 30 years, and had been promoted as RAW secretary over the then senior-most officer in the spy agency, P.V. Kumar. That move, some feared, reflected a policy to gradually change the culture of RAW, paving the way for a merger.        
	But never before had seven RAW officers been superseded at one go, the sources said, or the agency seen such a protest.        
	The development, sources said, was almost a throwback to the Janata government days of the late 1970s, when Prime Minister Morarji Desai had clipped RAWs wings, slashing its funds and ending its plans to expand its sphere of influence to Africa. It was only after the return of Indira Gandhi in 1980 that the agency regained its strength and stature.        
	RAW had been carved out of the IB in September 1968 and given the primary functions of collecting external intelligence related to counter-terrorism and conducting covert operations. Till then, the IB had handled both internal and external intelligence.        
	It was an IB officer, R.N. Kao, RAWs first chief, who expanded the organisation to what it is today.        
	A former RAW secretary said that from time to time there is this sort of talk about a merger. Many senior members of various governments have apparently felt that having one agency would streamline intelligence-gathering, avoiding co-ordination problems and needless rivalry. But it would be a retrograde step, he said.        
	Some sources warned that it was premature to conclude that a merger had already been decided, or that Mathur was bound to be made RAW secretary.        
	They, however, added that the four officers decision to go on leave was being discussed at the highest level of the government, and the officers would get a hearing in mid-September.

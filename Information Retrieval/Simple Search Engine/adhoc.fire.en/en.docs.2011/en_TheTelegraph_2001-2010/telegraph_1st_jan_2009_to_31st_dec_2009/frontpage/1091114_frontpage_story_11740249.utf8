          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                       Taj Mahal                           
	New Delhi, Nov. 13: The Monument to Love seems to be struggling to keep the romance going.        
	Taj Mahal has been eclipsed by Rajasthans palaces and forts and Keralas backwaters in an international survey that rated the worlds top 133 must-see sites.        
	The survey by National Geographic Societys Center for Sustainable Destinations has ranked Taj Mahal, Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri, all put together, 30th on its list of dream destinations, way behind Rajasthan at 19th and the Kerala hotspots at 23rd.         
	Occupying the top spot is Norways Fjords region, followed by British Columbia and Quebec in Canada.        
	The survey said Rajasthan had a strong sense of cultural identity and remarkable appeal and mystique.         
	Keralas lakes, rivers and canals present a unique travel and cultural experience for visitors when they sail through them on houseboats, the survey says.         
	The study addresses fears of environmental degradation in the backwaters because of the visitor rush, saying the number of boats is not so large to cause damage.        
	On Agra, the survey sounds a wake-up call: the three World Heritage sites of the Taj, Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri are in dire need of environmental planning.        
	The survey says the townscape lies in utter neglect, suggesting poor management by the civic authorities and the Uttar Pradesh government, though it points out that some things are getting better at the sites because of the hard work of heritage activists.

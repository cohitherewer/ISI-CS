          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT      
	Mumbai, July 21 (PTI): The lone surviving gunman of the 26/11 terror attack, Mohammad Ajmal Kasab, has said in his confession that he and nine other slain terrorists were confined to a house in Karachi for 45 days where Lashkar-e-Toiba operative, Abu Hamza, gave them lessons in navigating a boat. 	  
	Kasab also said that the house in which they were confined was the same that was shown on a Pakistani news channel, Geo TV, after the terror attack. 	 rdquo;Geo Tv ne jo dikhaya tha na 'Aatank ka Ghar' kehkar..humko wahi par rakha tha dedh mahine ke liye. (The house shown by Geo TV addressed as the 'House of Terror' was the same one where we were kept for one and a half months), rdquo; Kasab told special Judge M L Tahilyani. 	When the judge asked Kasab how he knew that the house was shown on Geo TV, he said, ldquo;Mujhe pata hai sir. (I know sir). rdquo; 	  
	Kasab said that Hamza and one more LeT operative Abu Kaahfa gave them lessons in navigating a boat and how to survive on a boat for a week. 	 rdquo;The house was near a creek and we were also given ammunitions, pistols and guns there in a bag, rdquo; he said. 	  
	After 45 days, Kasab and the others were taken to the creek and were made to board the 'Al-Hussaini' boat. 	Kasab further said that LeT operatives, Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, Kaahfa and Hamza were present to see them off at Karachi.  
	The 26/11 terror attack trial may not conclude soon despite the confession by prime accused Mohammed Ajmal Kasab in the court as he has only ldquo;partially rdquo; admitted to his guilt, special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam said.  
	Also, there are many other important aspects of evidence which prosecution has to adduce to expose terrorist infrastructure of perpetrators of the crime, he said, adding they will not let Kasab succeed in his ldquo;motive rdquo; of escaping with lesser punishment. 	 rdquo;What Kasab has told the court is not the entire story. He has partially admitted his guilt, rdquo; Nikam told reporters.

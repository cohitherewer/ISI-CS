The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | West on lips, Mamata stalls pension bill
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                West on lips, Mamata stalls pension bill
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                       Mamata                          
	New Delhi, Dec. 3: Mamata Banerjee tonight stalled a pension fund regulatory bill that would have let in foreign capital and let out a part of domestic savings for investments abroad.        
	Seeking to snatch from the Left the mantle of chief economic vigilante, the railway minister contended at a cabinet meeting that allowing foreign investment into the financial sector at this stage would send wrong signals.         
	She cited the example of the meltdown in the West to argue that many foreign funds, by investing in toxic assets, had failed in their fiduciary role of managing other peoples assets.        
	The economic argument, which the UPA government that swears by the aam aadmi will find difficult to contest in public, came in the middle of political tension between the Trinamul Congress and the home ministry over the refusal of a central team to visit violence-hit areas in Bengal. Mamata, whose MPs created a furore in the Lok Sabha today, is scheduled to meet the Prime Minister tomorrow to lodge a complaint about Bengals lawlessness.        
	The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority Bill provides for a 26 per cent cap on foreign direct investment, similar to that in insurance firms. The draft bill also has a provision that allows the pension fund to invest abroad a part of the money it collects from subscribers.         
	The two provisions had been opposed by the Left and some hardliners within the RSS, though they have found support in sections of the BJP which brought in insurance reforms.         
	The Left based its opposition on suggestions that pension funds would siphon off savings from local arms to offshore firms. Trade unions also have been feeding the fear, though the pension schemes have to offer subscribers an option under which their money will be invested exclusively in government bonds.         
	However, labour unions backed by Trinamul have been appealing to Mamata to oppose the bill to outgun the Left and spread their reach. A keen contest is on in Bengal over control of unions between Trinamul and the Left, and both wish to be seen as pro-labour.        
	Besides, the Trinamul leadership feared that unopposed passage of the bill would have armed the CPM and the CPI with a weapon to attack Mamata.         
	Mamata is believed to have already made it clear to the Congress leadership that while she would not oppose sale of small stakes in public sector units, attempts to transfer ownership of the PSUs to the private sector would not be acceptable.         
	She has already stalled the land relief and rehabilitation bill over a provision that allows partial government role in acquisition.        
	The pension fund bill has been in limbo since it debuted in 2005. The bill, held hostage by the Left in the previous government, had lapsed with the end of the 14th Lok Sabha on February 26, 2009.         
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee wanted to table the bill in this session to signal to western investors that India was ready to do business at a faster pace.        
	Pension regulators say the promotion of such funds is also necessary in a country like India where average life expectancy is going up.        
	Anti-riot bill nod        
	The cabinet tonight cleared a bill to check communal violence. The bill will enable the Centre to declare an area communally disturbed on its own and send security forces without the states request.

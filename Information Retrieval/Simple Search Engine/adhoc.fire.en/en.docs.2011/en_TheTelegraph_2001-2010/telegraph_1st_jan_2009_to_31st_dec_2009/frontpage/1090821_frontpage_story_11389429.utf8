          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                     
	Imphal, Aug. 20: Salam Bidyarani, the minor girl who was kept at a police station after her parents were found missing, was today admitted to the clinical psychology department of the Regional Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) for mental trauma.         
	The 11-year-olds relatives had brought her to the casualty department of RIMS last evening as she fainted frequently on reaching her home at Nongmaikhong under Mayang Imphal police station in Imphal West in the afternoon. The casualty department referred her to the clinical psychology department this morning for tests and treatment for mental trauma.         
	We have put the girl on observation. We will observe her for some time before carrying out a series of psychological tests to ascertain what caused her trauma. At this stage we cannot say anything about her mental condition, M. Akshaykumar, the head of clinical psychology department, told The Telegraph.         
	A psychologist attending on the girl said she could speak but could not complete a sentence. She is in a state of shock. We are observing her constantly.         
	Akshaykumar said he would like to keep the girl in hospital for some days for the tests and treatment.         
	Childrens rights activists in the state are up in arms against the picking up of and detention of a minor girl at a police station. They are likely to take legal action against the police.        
	Senior superintendent of police L. Kailun, however, maintained that the police took the girl for medical treatment after she fainted when a police team arrived at her house looking for her parents. She was kept at the police station as no responsible family member came forward to claim her.         
	A police team had come to her house on August 14 during the course of an operation launched in the area. Finding her father Salam Dewan and mother Memocha absent, they took her away and kept her at Mayang Imphal police station along with her grandmother. They left the police station on August 18 evening after local residents raised a hue and cry about the detention of a minor.         
	The police picked up her parents yesterday morning on charges of helping cadres of the Peoples Liberation Army. They recovered a huge quantity of ammunition and gre-nades from near their house.         
	A team of childrens rights activists visited the girls house yesterday. A team from the Childline also visited the hospital this morning. We will hold a meeting with the Child Welfare Committee, Imphal West, and officials of the social welfare department to take a decision on what is to be done in the case, Mala Lisam, the state co-ordinator of Childline, Imphal, said.        
	Residents of Nongmaikhong, under the banner of joint action committee, took out a rally here today, demanding release of the girls parents. Police allowed a four-member delegation to meet local (Hiyanglam) MLA E. Dwijamani Singh.         
	The delegation urged him to take up the matter with chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh for the release of her parents. A woman protester said the girls parents were innocent.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | India echo in Obama N-thunder
                                                                                                           India echo in Obama N-thunder
  - US signals ambitious shift, accepts moral responsibility to eliminate arms        K.P. Nayar                            North Korea on Sunday sought to upstage Barack Obamas European tour with the launch of a long-range rocket that apparently fizzled in the Pacific Ocean but theoretically could carry a warhead. But in Prague, Obama (in the foreground in AP picture) worked crowds into a frenzy with Sametova Revoluce (Velvet Revolution, a reference to how the former Czechoslovakia peacefully shook off communism in 1989) on his lips. Not everyone in Prague was pleased when Obama waded into a ticklish issue: plans to build a US missile defence shield in the Czech Republic and neighbouring Poland as long as Iran posed a threat to America and its allies. Many Czechs oppose the plan to station radar dishes outside Prague, fearing it could make their country a terrorist target.                                            
	Washington, April 5: US President Barack Obamas landmark declaration in Prague today to lead the world into a future without nuclear weapons borrows heavily from an Indian working paper to the UN General Assembly in 2006 calling for exactly the same goal.        
	In the most ambitious foreign policy initiative yet of his presidency that is still short of 100 days, Obama set a new milestone in the history of global nuclear disarmament by promising to make civilian nuclear co-operation not just India-specific, but a pillar of US foreign policy.        
	Obamas populist speech outlining his administrations approach to nuclear issues before a cheering, flag-waving crowd of 20,000 plus in 12 degrees temperature in the picturesque Czech capital swept clean by light early morning showers, revived memories of Jawaharlal Nehrus similarly raucuous visit to Josip Broz Titos Belgrade in 1961 where India made a historic call to the world to stop all testing of nuclear weapons.        
	Obamas speech in Prague left the clear impression that his nascent administration and the Indian government had discussed nuclear disarmament both at prime minister Manmohan Singhs meeting with the US President and during other recent occasions when New Delhi and Washington engaged each other.        
	But Indian officials would not comment on this, obviously not wanting to steal Obamas nuclear thunder today and because of the UPA governments reluctance to inject the US or the controversial nuclear deal into the election campaign any more than they have to.        
	At the first encounter -- albeit informal and part of a large gathering -- between India and the Obama administration in Munich exactly 24 days after the new US president was sworn in, national security adviser M.K. Narayanan spoke extensively on the subject: The future of nuclear weapons: is zero possible?        
	Narayanans speech at the 45th Munich Security Conference on February 13 received little attention in India because the subject appeared esoteric.        
	Narayanan, in fact, was privately criticised in South Block for having wasted an opportunity offered by the highly-rated conference to make out Indias case against cross-border terrorism when the attack on Mumbai in November was still fresh in the minds of the Munich audience.        
	The Obama administration and Capitol Hill were represented in Munich at very high levels and it is clear from Obamas speech that Narayanans inputs in Munich were noted in Washington.        
	The national security adviser was specific and unequivocal in outlining Indias case on non-proliferation, obviously keeping in mind a new administration in Washington, whose commitment to the Indo-US nuclear deal and attitude to Indias atomic weapons were then in doubt.        
	Narayanan said in Munich: We do not envisage it (disarmament) as replacing existing arsenals by new categories of nuclear weapon systems. Our perception of arms control is that by addressing the issue piecemeal it merely tends to perpetuate nuclear weapons in the hands of a few chosen nations.        
	Until now, US policy has been just what Narayanan was complaining about. Obama today changed it, in effect, to what the national security adviser said in another part of his speech: We view disarmament as referring to concrete reductions in nuclear arsenals with the ultimate objective of achieving a nuclear-free world.        
	Indias working paper to the UN General Assembly in October 2006, among other things, called for an unequivocal commitment by nuclear weapon states to completely eliminate all nuclear weapons, steps to reduce the salience of nuclear weapons in national security doctrines and for negotiations on a Nuclear Weapons Convention prohibiting the development, production, stockpiling and use of nuclear weapons and on their time-bound destruction, leading to the global, non-discriminatory and verifiable elimination of nuclear weapons.        
	Obama pledged in Prague today that to put an end to Cold War thinking, we will reduce the role of nuclear weapons in our national security strategy and urge others to do the same.        
	He added: As a nuclear power -- as the only nuclear power to have used a nuclear weapon -- the United States has a moral responsibility to act. So today, I state clearly and with conviction Americas commitment to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons. This goal will not be reached quickly -- perhaps not in my lifetime. It will take patience and persistence. But now we, too, must ignore the voices who tell us that the world cannot change.        
	Obamas words today clearly had shades of what Nehru wrote in 1956 in the foreword to the worlds first study that Indias first Prime Minister asked Homi Bhabha, the then chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, and Indian physicist D.S. Kothari to conduct on the fallout of nuclear explosions as a sequel to the US nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.        
	Notwithstanding the seeming identity of views today between India and the US on nuclear issues, there is biting irony in the positions of Washington and New Delhi.        
	Nehru outlined his case for the elimination of nuclear testing at a peace venue: the first non-aligned summit in Belgrade. Obama is in Europe expanding the Nato military alliance and today he pledged to proceed with his predecessors provocative plan for a missile defence system in Europe.        
	Also, Obama said: My administration will immediately and aggressively pursue US ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, an action that could put New Delhi and Washington at odds.        
	He said: We will strengthen the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty--something India does not like.        
	But he also said what New Delhi has been waiting to hear from the new US President: We should build a new framework for civil nuclear co-operation, including an international fuel bank, so that countries can access peaceful power without increasing the risks of proliferation.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Lady thieves, spurred by Dhoom:2
                                                                                                           Lady thieves, spurred by Dhoom:2
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                            Aishwarya in a poster of the movie Dhoom:2                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 13: Geeta spent her mornings cleaning and cooking and preparing her three children for school, just like hundreds of young mothers in her lower middle-class neighbourhood.        
	At night, she sang the kids to sleep with a lullaby.        
	But a little past midnight, the 30-year-old turned Aishwarya Rai.        
	She would steal out of home and walk to the same spot every night for a tryst. Waiting for her would be not a young lover but four other women, all homemakers.        
	Or thieves, if you believe Delhi police who picked up all five last night on an informers tip. Geeta was the leader of the all-women gang, the master thief  perhaps a little like Sunehri, the smart thief played by Aishwarya in Dhoom:2, she has apparently told the police.        
	The women had been raiding warehouses in the industrial Mundka locality, stealing whatever they could find and carry, the police said.        
	But they had a (bias) for battery cells. They would pick up boxes that contained at least 50 batteries each and sell them to a junk dealer, said Raj Kumar, inspector (special staff), west district.        
	On an average, the gang made Rs 1 lakh a day  that is, Rs 20,000 each. We are yet to find out how many robberies they have committed.        
	Four of the women are married and three are in their 40s. All have young children. They are from the Sansi tribe, which is spread across north India and claims its lineage from Raja Sanswal Sansi, who died fighting the Mughals with Rana Pratap,        
	The Sansis were tagged a criminal tribe by the British, a slur the Indian government removed by an act of Parliament in 1952. But the community still struggles to find jobs. The women  all hailing from Nanakpura in Rohtak, Haryana  have blamed grinding poverty for their life of crime, officers said.        
	Geeta allegedly told the police the womens husbands were either jobless alcoholics or drug addicts, so they needed to steal to feed their children.        
	Geeta had started out as a rag-picker after settling down in Nangloi, west Delhi. Soon, she and Kela, 32, a widow with children, began stealing iron and wooden items from a local furniture market, the police said. A chance meeting with Krishna, 40, allegedly led to the idea of raiding godowns.        
	Krishna apparently motivated Geeta and Kela by citing Sunehris example. The trio drafted Sheela, 20, and Ompati, 40. Two of the women would lure the guards away while the rest would clean out the warehouse, officers said.        
	They enjoyed relatively good lifestyles with their earnings and even bought luxury items. None of them has shown remorse, Kumar said.

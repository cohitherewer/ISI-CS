          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Sen, Shankar: Change of guard                          
	New Delhi, Feb. 19: A case of political impropriety, or is it a matter of critical diplomatic necessity? The UPA governments decision to clear Meera Shankar, currently ambassador to Germany, as New Delhis envoy to Washington barely weeks before its term runs out, has set the capitals power circles rippling with speculation.        
	Clubbed with Shankars is the decision to post Sharat Sabharwal, currently special secretary in the foreign office, as high commissioner to Islamabad, replacing Satyabrata Pal, who retires on February 28. Could South Block not have waited till a new government takes office in June?         
	Sure enough, the term of the current incumbent, Ronen Sen, expires at the end of March, but that, many argue, is a mere technicality. A political appointee of the UPA dispensation who was persuaded to extend his stay in Washington in order to see through the Indo-US nuclear deal, Sen could easily have been asked to hold the fort until the general elections.        
	However, foreign office circles underlined, rather sharply, the urgent need for a change in Washington. In the words of one diplomat: The reasons for the change lie not at home but in the US. Ronen Sen was too closely identified with the Bush administration and we must understand that Bush is there no longer. There is a new government in Washington which wishes to usher a radical change to the Bush era. It is a thoughtful move to post a new envoy there, they will probably feel better dealing with a person not so deeply twined into the Bush dispensation. (Ronen) Sen has done his job for the country with his role in seeing the nuclear deal through, it is time for him to move on.        
	Shankar, a 1973 batch IFS officer, served in Rajiv Gandhis PMO and is seen in some quarters as close to the Gandhis. Indeed, to some, her appointment by a government that has virtually run its course, smacks of political favouritism, a reward so to speak before it goes out of office.        
	The chief Opposition, the BJP, has not reacted officially to the move, but asked if it smacked of impropriety, lead spokesperson Arun Jaitley said: I havent followed it closely, but it is true that the government should avoid such code of conduct-eve appointments to such key positions.        
	Keen to avoid any such insinuation, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is believed have favoured the idea that appointments to key diplomatic posts be left to the new government.        
	However, external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee is understood to have argued that since these involved career diplomats and not political appointees, the Centre should go ahead with them. His argument was that these posts were too crucial to be kept vacant for any length of time, or to be handed to deputy chiefs of mission.         
	Shankar, who has previously headed Indias counter-terror dialogue with important countries, has until October 2010 in service. It is anybodys guess how Shankar will get along with the Barack Obama administration. She is seen by peers in the IFS as a staunch nationalist who does not believe Uncle Sam can do no wrong.         
	But opinion among New Delhis mandarins seems to favour a change in the Indian embassy in Washington following the change of guard in the White House.

          OUR BUREAU                                    
	Imphal/Chumukedima (Dimapur), Feb. 3: Union home minister P. Chidambaram today talked tough, whether it was against militancy in Manipur or pursuing peace within the ambit of the Constitution in Nagaland.        
	During a meeting of the Unified Command in Imphal, he minced no words while asking chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh and the security forces to take stringent measures against militant activities, including extortion. He promised to send additional forces for the purpose.         
	The command reviewed the prevailing situation and briefed Chidambaram on the steps being taken to bring militancy under control.         
	I asked the chief minister and the officials to come down heavily on extortion. Funding militancy is also a crime, Chidambaram told reporters before boarding a chopper at Imphal airport at the end of his three-hour visit to the state.         
	He said extortion was eating away a significant amount of development funds for schools, colleges, hospitals, roads and other infrastructure. If firmer and stronger measures are taken, extortion can be checked and the system can come back, he added.         
	The clear policy of the Centre and Manipur government is not to tolerate violence. Violence will not pay. This message should go to the militants, he said, indicating intensified counter-insurgency operations in the coming days.         
	Chidambaram also discussed the situation in the state with Governor Gurbachan Jagat.         
	The ministers visit has come at a time when a militant group is holding three senior officials of the state food and civil supplies department hostage, allegedly for ransom. The three were abducted on January 30.         
	The family members of the officials and meira paibis (women activists) staged a sit-in at Soibam Leikai in Imphal East, demanding their safe release, even as police conducted raids to rescue them.         
	The visit also came a day after the NSCN (Isak-Muivah) cadres vacated Siroy camp in Ukhrul following a 14-day standoff with the Assam Rifles. However, the minister did not make any comment on issues concerning the militant outfit. Evading a question on peace talks with the NSCN (I-M), he said, I will not discuss this (with you).         
	He thanked the state police and the security forces for their tremendous achievement.         
	Ibobi Singh demanded raising of more India Reserve Battalion and additional paramilitary forces for effective counter-insurgency operations. I have taken note of the demands and I will address it, he promised.         
	The home minister flew from Imphal to Chumukedima near Dimapur, where he reviewed the security scenario in Nagaland.         
	He said any solution to the Naga political problem would have to be found within the Constitution and warned that the government and the security forces will not tolerate violation of ceasefire ground rules by NSCN cadres.         
	The minister said if the NSCN (Isak-Muivah) submitted an interim proposal, the Centre was prepared to examine it, provided it was within the ambit of the Constitution.         
	The NSCN (I-M), however, had sought an interim proposal from the Centre during the December 7-9 talks at Amsterdam. The outfit has already submitted a 31-point charter of demands, including a special federal relationship with New Delhi, but on the condition that Naga integration would be the basis for taking forward the peace process.         
	The minister said the Constitution gave ample scope to hammer out a solution to the Naga problem. The Centre was sincere about resolving it and would pursue the matter with the NSCN (I-M).         
	Both the state government and Opposition Congress requested him to expedite the peace process. They said 11 years of talks were too long and had tired the Naga people.        
	Chidambaram also said the government was determined to enforce the ground rules in toto and violators would be punished.         
	At two separate meetings  one with chief minister Neiphiu Rio and his cabinet ministers at the police guest house here and the other with top security officials  Chidambaram directed both the government and the security forces to act tough withcadres violating ground rules.        
	Chidambaram, who was visiting the states for the first time after assuming charge of home, left for Delhi in the evening.

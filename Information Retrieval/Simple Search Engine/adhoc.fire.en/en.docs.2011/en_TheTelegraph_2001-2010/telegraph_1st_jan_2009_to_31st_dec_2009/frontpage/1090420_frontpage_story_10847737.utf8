The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Knights start with nightmare
                                                                                                           Knights start with nightmare
          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                              
	Cape Town, April 19: For the Kolkata Knight Riders, defeat (an eight-wicket thrashing really at the hands of an inspired Deccan Chargers) in their IPL 2009 opener came at 8.43pm local time, but things had started to go wrong from the afternoon.        
	Some, of course, may go back four weeks when John Buchanan, the franchises head of cricket operations, went public with his confusion-creating concept of multiple leaders.         
	However, to cut to the present...         
	Principal owner Shah Rukh Khan, for example, was to have attended the team meeting before the Knights left their hotel for Newlands. He reached late and, so, could only speak to five of them. Later, though, Shah Rukh did spend a few minutes in the team bus.        
	So, if the Knights journey got off to an unsynchronised start, it just didnt get any better as the rain-hit day progressed.        
	A few hours later, the Knights were on the mat, done in as much by new captain Brendon McCullums decision to bat as by an awful response, collectively, to a situation which called for judicious play.        
	While a change in captaincy worked for the Chargers, where Adam Gilchrist has replaced V.V.S. Laxman, it didnt for the Knights.        
	McCullum lasted three deliveries; predecessor Sourav Ganguly did no better. He was around for a dozen of them, but managed no more than one run and was repeatedly beaten by Fidel Edwards pace.        
	Its one thing to be playing international cricket, quite another to have quit even at the first-class level.        
	Souravs footwork wouldnt have been like this, say, six months ago, former India captain Ravi Shastri told The Telegraph.        
	To be fair to Sourav, he was under pressure to show that he deserved to have been retained as captain. But, then, right through his India career, hed proved a point when it had to be made.        
	It wasnt to be here, a venue where Sourav registered two hundreds in the 2003 World Cup. Three veterans --- Sachin Tendulkar, Anil Kumble (who too has quit first class cricket) and Rahul Dravid --- had a great opening day, yesterday, but that number didnt swell.        
	The Knights managed 101, bowled out with two deliveries remaining. At the half-way stage, their total had been as little as 31 for three.        
	With the explosive Herschelle Gibbs (a Capetonian, by the way) and Gilchrist starting at a frenetic pace, the target had to be overhauled sooner rather than later.        
	The second-session script held no surprises and the Chargers, after being 69 for two at the end of 10 overs, won in only 13.1 overs.        
	After a series of negative headlines in the lead-up, an entirely avoidable occurrence that, the Knights have earned one more. Well deserved, again.        
	We didnt play to our strengths and the Chargers utilised the conditions very well... However, its a long tournament and weve got opportunities to lift ourselves, McCullum said.        
	The Chargers Rudra Pratap Singh got the MoM award for an excellent effort upfront. He finished with four for 22.

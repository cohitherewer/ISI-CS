  - Untiring Nadal marches on, federer fourteen elusive                                Nadal puts an arm around Federer to console him. (AFP)                                
	Melbourne, Feb. 1: Rafael Nadal had the legs, and Roger Federer the tear ducts  all of which made sport grander tonight.        
	Nadal also had caring arms, one cradling the silver cup and the other draped around the neck of his vanquished opponent who had minutes ago blubbed and blinked into the microphone and was still wiping tears.        
	Just as Federer needed another go at his runner-ups speech at the Rod Laver Arena after his first attempt ended in sobs, his five-set defeat to Nadal in the Australian Open final means he is going to have to return to the Grand Slam court before he draws level with Pete Samprass 14 majors.        
	Federers tears showed just how badly he wants to make tennis history, so when the sport sees the completion of Federers Fourteen, the Swiss is unlikely to be standing there with dry eyes.         
	Largely an emotional flat-liner during his matches, Federer shows his softer side after the last ball has been struck, and this was not the first time he had cried.        
	And whats wrong with Federer letting it all out on court? But it was the first occasion that he had done so after receiving the beaten finalists plate.         
	God, its killing me, Federer said during his first try, and his girlfriend, Mirka Vavrinec, looked on from the entourages box with her hand over her mouth.        
	When Federer stepped away from the microphone, Nadal stepped in with his consoling arm. It was a touching moment after a final that ended after midnight.         
	I love this game. It means the world to me, so it hurts when you lose, the 27-year-old said, after returning to congratulate the world No. 1.        
	You deserved it, Federer told the victorious 22-year-old who added the Australian Open to his French and Wimbledon with an epic 7-5, 3-6, 7-6, 3-6, 6-2 at the Rod Laver Arena in a match that lasted nearly four-and-a-half hours. You played a fantastic final.        
	Roger, sorry for today. I really know how you feel right now, the dry-eyed Nadal said during his one-take on-court speech in an epitaph befitting the momentous confrontation, the first five-setter in an Australian Open final in 21 years.         
	Remember, youre a great champion, youre one of the best in history. Youre going to improve on the 14 of Sampras, added Nadal, capable of a Grand Slam this season, 40 years after Australian great Rod Laver last won all four majors in one season.        
	The gesture and the words underlined their friendly rivalry despite the power and spin the two well-mannered young men put into their game when they face each other.        
	As Nadal gradually began to grasp the degree of Federers emotional distress, his moment of triumph also became a moment of reflection.         
	Of course it can happen to all of us, he said of Federers breakdown. It was an emotional moment, and I think this also makes sport grander, to see a great champion like Federer expressing his emotions. It shows his human side. But in these moments, when you see a rival who is also a comrade feeling like this, you enjoy the victory a little bit less.        
	Barring injury, it is surely still a matter of when, and not if, Federer reaches the Sampras number.         
	Federer didnt play his best tennis during this final, and his first serve let him down. But Federer and Nadal are now in the habit of producing long-running, late-finishing contests, as this followed last summers Wimbledon final of four hours and 48 minutes.         
	Given that Nadals semi-final victory had been the longest recorded match in the tournaments history, at five hours and 14 minutes, you had to wonder whether Nadals legs were going to hold up in the closing stages.         
	But those worries were misplaced. Yet again, Nadal demonstrated what an extraordinary competitor he is, as this victory was achieved in four hours and 23 minutes, meaning his last two matches lasted over nine-and-a-half-hours.        
	Maybe the final was not quite another tennis masterpiece but it was certainly epic entertainment.                    WITH THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AND NYTNS

                                                                                                           Drought tag for 7 more districts
  - Relief plans for Giridih, Santhal Pargana; crop insurance extended          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                                          
	Ranchi, July 29: Governor K. Sankaranarayanan today declared seven more districts as drought hit, taking the total number of parched zones to 11.        
	According to Raj Bhavan spokesman S.N. Jha, the new districts on the drought list are Dumka, Deoghar, Pakur, Godda, Sahebganj and Jamtara in Santhal Pargana and Giridih. Sankaranarayanans predecessor Syed Sibtey Razi had declared four districts  Palamau, Chatra, Garhwa and Latehar  as drought hit.         
	The governor is said to have taken the decision to cover these districts under drought-hit zone, as it was found that the state was facing over 40 per cent rainfall deficit, severely affecting paddy plantation. Till July 27, the state had received only 255mm rainfall as against the normal 440 mm.         
	The situation in the districts, which were declared drought hit, is all the more worrisome. The paddy transplantation has not covered more than 3 per cent of the target, agriculture secretary A.P. Singh told The Telegraph.         
	Singh said that the official machinery would find out what alternative crops could be grown with the available moisture in soil in drought-hit districts. We will also prepare the farmer to go for early rabi crops if there is rain in future, he added.        
	Moreover, the agriculture director has been asked to get in touch with the public sector seed companies to procure required seeds, which can be immediately distributed among distressed farmers free of cost or at a nominal rate, he said.                                             
	In normal season, we supply seeds to farmers at 75 per cent of the cost. Besides, the deputy commissioners have been asked to send a status report of the damage to standing crops to provide compensation to affected farmers, he added.        
	We have also asked the banks to stop recovery of agriculture loan from the farmers in these districts. The crop insurance scheme has been extended for one more month, Singh said.        
	Based on these reports, the disaster management department will send a memorandum to the central government to get financial assistance and relief for the state farmers, a Raj Bhavan official said.        
	The sources said that other departments too were asked to scale up their efforts to implement the welfare schemes, including Nrega, old-age pension and strengthen the public distribution system.        
	The DCs have also been asked to take effective steps to check migration of labourers, quality of drinking water, especially in the drought-hit areas and adequate power supply for irrigation purposes across the districts.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | HSBC frees up employees
                                                                                                           HSBC frees up employees

	Calcutta, March 25: Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC), whose association with Calcutta dates back to 1855, has freed up some employees in India, including the eastern city, and asked them to find internal opportunities within the group.        
	At least 35 employees in Calcutta are among the 500 said to have been freed up for redeployment in the wake of the economic downturn. Sources said the shortlisted employees could be considered redundant if suitable positions were not found before, in some cases, April-end.        
	HSBC, which today announced that 1,200 jobs would be cut in Britain, is one of the oldest foreign banks in India and the countrys second largest multinational bank in terms of total assets. The bank has an employee base of 7,500, while its other ventures account for 27,500 jobs.        
	The bank has not opted for layoffs in India but the sources said if the freed up employees were unable to find internal slots, they would have little option but to resign.        
	An HSBC official said: The ever-changing external business environment requires every organisation to continually analyse the way it functions, to ensure an optimum efficiency level across all its businesses. Our business strategies have to be flexible to adapt to emergent challenges. We have evaluated our businesses and, as a result, some staff have been freed up from their current activities. We are currently doing a pan-India exercise to redeploy these staff to other businesses within the group.        
	However, the official declined to say how many employees have been freed up, saying the process was still on. But he added that no one had been laid off since January 1, this year.        
	The source who put the number of those affected in Calcutta at 35 said: Many of the employees have been asked to redeploy themselves in other sections of the office by the end of April.        
	The source said most of those shortlisted were young, middle-level employees. They know there are far fewer internal opportunities than the number of employees applying for them. Only a fraction will be absorbed, another source said.        
	Some of the employees are also wondering whether they would be given any compensation if they fail to find an internal position and have to quit.        
	The current account section, which deals with small and medium businesses, and the personal finance division are said to be among those hit hard by the downturn. However, the evaluation exercise covers most departments.        
	The sources said unionised and old workforce has been left out of the exercise.        
	The roots of HSBC, which set up Indias first ATM, in the country can be traced back to 1853 in the then Bombay and, by 1855, it had spread its reach to Calcutta.

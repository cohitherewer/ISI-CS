                                Richardson: Actress alert                            
	Los Angeles, March 27 (PTI): Natasha Richardsons tragedy has helped save a little girl in Ohio, who would have died if her parents had not read about the reason behind actresss demise and taken her to the doctor.        
	Seven-year-old Morgan McCracken was hours away from death, two days after she was hit by a baseball during a game, when her father Donald decided to call doctors for advice after realising his daughters injury was similar to the one which killed Richardson, the www.CNN.com reported.        
	Because of Natasha, we called the paediatrician immediately. And by the time I got off the phone with him, Morgan was sobbing, her head hurt so much, the girls father Donald McCracken said.        
	He took Morgan to hospital where doctors conducted tests and she was immediately shifted to a hospital in Cleveland. Doctors told us that if we hadnt brought her in Thursday night, she never would have woken up, McCracken said.

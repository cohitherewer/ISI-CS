The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Star shoulder holds up, hope for IPL
                                                                                                           Star shoulder holds up, hope for IPL
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                                              
	Mumbai, Feb. 16: The shoulder that has propelled the dreams of a billion people and more underwent a long-overdue surgery this evening.         
	Shah Rukh Khan, who has been on a whirlwind tour to promote his home production Billu, landed from London and kept his date to repair a tear in the rotator cuff of his left shoulder at Breach Candy hospital.        
	The surgery started about 4.45pm and lasted over two hours. He was given general anaesthesia. The surgery was successful and he is expected to be discharged latest by Wednesday morning, said Major General Vijay Krishna, the chief executive of the south Mumbai hospital known for its VIP patients.        
	The star, recuperating in one of the hospitals top- end sea-facing suites on the fourth floor, is due to resume shooting on March 14. By the time the IPLs second season gets under way, from April 10, the Kolkata Knight Riders owner should be in the stands to cheer, though fans may have to do without his impromptu jigs.        
	The 43-year-old actor went through a planned shoulder arthroscopy  a minimally invasive surgical procedure.         
	Dr Sanjay Desai, consultant orthopaedic surgeon at the hospital who specialises in arthroscopic operations, conducted the surgery.        
	We repaired the tear by making two tiny incisions  one for the arthroscope (a video-fitted surgical device) and one for the surgical instruments. We decided to use general anaesthesia after discussion with the patient, said a doctor in the team that operated on the star.         
	Doctors said Shah Rukhs tear is in the supraspinatus, a rotator cuff muscle where tears are common. The star will have to go through physiotherapy sessions for a week after his release. Within two to three weeks he should be fine. But he will need to be gentle with his shoulder for the next six-eight months, said the doctor.        
	Accompanied by wife Gauri and friend Karan Johar, Shah Rukh checked into Breach Candy around 3.30pm after landing in Mumbai in the morning following an 11-hour flight from London.        
	We were in touch with him all through. Although we were ready for him to check in since noon, we were told he would be a bit late, said the doctor.        
	Shah Rukh wanted to freshen up at Mannat, his Bandra Bandstand home, and meet his children (Aryan and Suhana) before leaving for the hospital, 15km away.        
	Shah Rukh was away in London (for the Billu premiere) when some criminals attacked his house on Friday. He was keen to go home first, said a source close to the actor.        
	The source said SRK has already promised Karan Johar he would be back to shoot for My Name is Khan by March 14.        
	That may be a bit close, but all depends on his physiotherapy, said the doctor.        
	Even then, the usually energetic star will have to be cautious. Shah Rukh, they pointed out, is extremely animated in his discussions and would have to be a bit careful.         
	Doctors pointed out that virtually any movement of the arm involves the use of the rotator cuff and the risk of injury is high among people who repeatedly use their arms and shoulders.         
	However, nine in 10 patients in India with rotator cuff tears are above 45 years of age with little physical activity. They develop the injury after engaging in abrupt shoulder-related activity such as lifting heavy objects, said Pushpinder Bajaj, an orthopaedic surgeon in New Delhi.         
	A typical symptom of rotator cuff tear is acute pain or progressively increasing pain in the shoulder. Minor rotator cuff tears may be treated with medication, but persons with severe tears that do not respond to therapy may need surgery.         
	Shah Rukh had injured his shoulder while shooting for Dulha Mil Gaya with Sushmita Sen in November and was advised surgery. But he shelved the plan as he had to shoot for a schedule of My Name is Khan in Los Angeles.        
	The LA cold worsened the injury and then he got busy with the release of Billu on February 13. So the surgery got delayed. My Name is Khan still has unfinished work which requires Shah Rukh. That will happen once he is out of hospital, said a source in Johars Dharma Productions.                    WITH INPUTS FROM G.S.

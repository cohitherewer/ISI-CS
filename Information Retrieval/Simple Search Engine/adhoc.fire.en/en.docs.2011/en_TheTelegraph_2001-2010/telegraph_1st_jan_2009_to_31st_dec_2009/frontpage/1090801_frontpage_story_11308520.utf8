          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 31: The Congress surrendered to Mamata Banerjee tonight by deciding to pull its candidates from two central Calcutta Assembly seats with less than 24 hours to go for withdrawal of nomination.        
	State Congress president Pranab Mukherjee announced the withdrawal of the Congress nominees from Sealdah and Bowbazar, due for by-polls on August 18.        
	In the larger interest of anti-Left unity, the Congress has decided to withdraw its candidates. We have just been told by Delhi to do so, said Subrata Mukherjee, the partys working president for Bengal, who had earlier expressed complete lack of knowledge of which way the talks were going in Delhi.        
	While Sonia Gandhi would have given ground to Mamata to keep the alliance that worked so well in the Lok Sabha polls on an even keel, the decision is a blow to the local Congress, which had seen glimmers of a revival after the protests and bandh last month.        
	The surrender is of a piece with the outcome of the negotiations for Lok Sabha seat-sharing earlier where the local Congress had felt shortchanged. But this time the Bengal partys hopes had been raised as the high command had stuck to its demand for at least one seat until it backed down at the last minute.        
	Last night, the talks appeared to have almost collapsed with Mamata refusing to budge from her demand for both seats.        
	A Congress MP from Bengal said: Mamata has been doing all the agitation in south Bengal and hence she will certainly take the cake. But this proves she will have the last laugh when candidates are selected for the 2011 Assembly polls. That will not augur well for the Congress.        
	Even in the hours immediately preceding the announcement, Keshava Rao, the AICC general secretary in charge of Bengal, had kept the local Congresss hopes up by saying: The party has to stand on its own feet in Bengal.        
	His (Raos) statement that the Congress should stand on its own feet meant a revival of the party in Calcutta at the cost of Trinamul. How can Mamata tolerate that? Trinamul MLA Jyotipriya Mallick said.

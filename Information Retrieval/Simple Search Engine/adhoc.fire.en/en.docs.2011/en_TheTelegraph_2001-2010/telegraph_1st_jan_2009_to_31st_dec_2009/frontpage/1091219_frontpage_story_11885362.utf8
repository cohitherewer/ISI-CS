The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Advani steps up, so does loyal Sushma
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Advani steps up, so does loyal Sushma
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 18: Sushma Swaraj took over as the Opposition leader in the Lok Sabha after L.K. Advani stepped down today and assumed a new position as chairman of the BJP parliamentary party.         
	The BJP constitution was amended at a meeting of its MPs to create the post.         
	Unlike in September 2005, when the RSS pushed him out as the BJP president for praising Mohammed Ali Jinnah, the changeover this time, scripted by new Sangh sarsanghachalak Mohanrao Bhagwat, seemed less painful for Advani. Not only was he rehabilitated, his proteges were promoted or left untouched.        
	The show at the Parliament annexe was choreographed to dispel the perception of a party at war with itself and its paterfamilias in Nagpur.         
	Some in the BJP had been spreading the word for the last five months that Advanis exit would see the Dilli Four cabal of Arun Jaitley, Sushma, M. Venkaiah Naidu and Ananth Kumar, considered his loyalists, scurry to the boondocks. But Sushmas elevation and Jaitleys renomination as the Opposition leader in the Rajya Sabha was the RSS way of saying it had no intention of overturning the hierarchy or playing factional politics.        
	When Advani admitted to a sense of relief and satisfaction today, it was construed to mean that he believed the parliamentary party would function exactly the way he wanted.         
	Sushma said she was not worried about her new job because Advani was around as a guide. Arun (Jaitley) is like my brother, she said to quell speculation over their alleged rivalry.        
	In the past, Advani has said the Lok Sabha leader is the BJPs prime ministerial candidate, but Sushma is not being seen as one.         
	The real drama will unfold closer to 2014 when we expect some of our regional satraps like Narendra Modi and Shivraj Singh Chauhan to reveal their hands, a functionary said.         
	Advani recalled his association with the Sangh, going back to when he was a 14-year-old in Karachi. I was an RSS pracharak (propagandist) then and if I had not been one, I would not have come into politics when the Jan Sangh was formed.         
	The tangential acknowledgement of the Sanghs role was in contrast to the bitterness that marked his speech at the Chennai national executive five years ago.         
	He had then asked Sangh leaders to stick to their greater mission of man-making and nation-building instead of telling the BJP what to do.

          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                                          Some of the Indian Mujahideen suspects outside the MCOCA court in Mumbai on Tuesday. (PTI, Fotocorp)				                                 
	Mumbai, Feb. 17: The software engineer accused of drafting terror emails militant group Indian Mujahideen sent minutes before a series of deadly bombings last year today withdrew his application to turn approver after city police decided to try all arrested suspects.        
	Joint commissioner (crime) Rakesh Maria said Mohammed Mansoor Asghar Peerbhoys decision wouldnt affect the case.        
	We dont need any approver. We have a tight case. His turning approver would only have helped him to lighten his sentence. He played a very crucial part on his own volition and not under any coercion. So he deserves the harshest sentence due to him, Maria added.        
	The police today filed a 1,800-page chargesheet against 27 IM members for alleged involvement in bombings and terror attacks across India in the past three years, including those in Bangalore, Ahmedabad and Delhi in 2008.        
	Peerbhoy, 31, who worked as principal software engineer in a multinational firm on a salary of Rs 19 lakh a year, is one of the 21 in custody. Six are absconding.        
	All 27 have been accused of waging war against the country and charged under the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA). The accused have also been charged under the Indian Penal Codes Arms Act, Explosives Act, Explosives Substances Act, Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and the Information Technology Act, Maria said.        
	Minutes before the July 26 serial blasts in Ahmedabad and the September 13 bombings in Delhi, the militant group had sent out warning emails to media houses.        
	Peerbhoy is accused of drafting the mail sent before the Ahmedabad blasts.

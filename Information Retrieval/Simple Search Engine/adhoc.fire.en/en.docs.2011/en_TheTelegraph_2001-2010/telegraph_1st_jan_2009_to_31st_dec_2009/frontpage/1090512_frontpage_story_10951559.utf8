  - Five bodies fished out of Loktak         OUR CORRESPONDENT                                     
	Imphal, May 11: Suspected militants today killed five Hindi-speaking people inside Keibul Lamjao National Park in Manipurs Bishnupur district where security forces had launched a flushout operation on the eve of the second phase of Lok Sabha elections on April 22.         
	Four other Hindi-speaking people were also feared killed inside the park. Police are searching for their bodies.         
	Sources said the bodies were recovered by a team of villagers and mediapersons who scanned the floating park this afternoon following reports that some armed persons had taken nine non-Manipuris inside Loktak this morning.         
	Four bodies were found on a phumdi (floating biomass). Three were lying together while another was found a little distance away on the same phumdi. The fifth body was found lying on another phumdi nearby.         
	A member of the search party said the bodies bore gunshot wounds and multiple stab injury marks. Their hands were tied.         
	The phumdis, where the bodies were found, are located about 2km inside the park from Khordak Awang Leikai, from where the park can be approached.         
	The villagers and the media team reached the site before the police could. A police team left the Bishnupur district headquarters late in the afternoon after the bodies were recovered.         
	Rumours had started around 1pm today that suspected militants had killed nine Hindi-speaking people in Loktak lake earlier in the day. The rumours started after some villagers living on the fringe of the lake saw armed persons taking nine Hindi-speaking people, with their hands tied, inside the lake around 11.30am.         
	It is believed that the assailants abducted the nine persons from elsewhere and brought them to the park with the intention of killing them. All nine are feared dead.        
	Though the police could not name any group, they suspected a militant group to be behind the massacre.         
	They could not give any clues to the motive behind the killings.         
	Neither could they say whether todays killings and the recent flush-out had any link.         
	The site of todays killing was one of the battlegrounds during Operation Summer Storm launched by the 57th Mountain Division last month. The troops had killed 12 militants, busted five rebel camps inside the park and recovered 10 weapons including AK rifles. The operation began on April 11 night and was called off on April 21 morning.         
	The killings are the latest in a string of attacks on non-Manipuri people in the state. Five migrant labourers were killed in five separate strikes in Imphal West and Imphal East districts between February 28 and March 22. Imphal West was the worst affected.         
	The attacks forced a large number of migrants to flee Manipur while many others working in different parts of the state took shelter in a relief camp at Dharmasala, a lodging centre managed by the business community of the state.

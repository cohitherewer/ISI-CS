  - Nobel ends a male domination, picks Ostrom for economics prize           OUR BUREAU                                                
	Oct. 12: Elinor Ostrom of the US has become the first woman to win the Economics Nobel, raising the number of women winners this year to a record five and averting an anti-climax after the astounding choice of Barack Obama for the peace prize.        
	Ostrom defied conventional wisdom and proved that communities can trump state control and corporations. Her studies showed that user-managed properties  such as community fish stocks or woodland areas  more often than not were better run than standard theories predicted. The previously accepted view was that common property was poorly managed and should be either regulated centrally or privatised.        
	Ostrom shares this years prize with fellow American Oliver E. Williamson who was recognised for his analysis of conflict resolution by firms and markets. The 76-year-old Ostrom teaches at Indiana University while the 77-year-old Williamson works at the University of California, Berkeley.        
	The governance issues the economists have raised have present-day relevance because of the economic crisis in the West but Ostroms gender also became a talking point, not least because the field is dominated by men.        
	I hope that it will be inspiring for women researchers that you dont have to be a male in order to win the economics prize, said professor Tore Ellingsen of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which announced the award.         
	The economics prize, announced last in the Nobel series and officially called the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, was established in 1968. It is not part of the original group of awards.        
	You have to look back and notice how few women have reached senior professor positions in economics, and also given the prize is awarded for work at least 20 years old, Ellingsen said.        
	Till now, the prize had eluded even economists like Joan Robinson. The effect of politics in the selection process and an imbalance in women representation in the subject have remained topics of debate among economists.         
	One cannot actually go overboard with her winning the prize. But I must also say this is a little interesting. I will have to read up on her, said Jayati Ghosh, professor at the Centre for Economic Studies and Planning in Jawaharlal Nehru University.         
	According to Ghosh, there is something in the system that restricts women economists even in the US and the UK to the lower reaches of academics. You will find more women in the so-called softer areas in subjects like energy, health or gender, said Ghosh.         
	Perceptions exist of a bias against women in mainstream economics, often criticised for its obsession with esoteric mathematical models.         
	For some, the recognition for Ostrom is significant not only because she is a woman but also because she defied conventional wisdom in her research. She has written extensively on functions of institutions. The award is significant as it recognises institutional economics, instead of usual analytical economics, said Suresh Tendulkar, former chairman of the Prime Ministers Economic Advisory Council.         
	But Tendulkar added: There always remains an element of subjectivity in peer reviews and, at times, it may go against some individuals irrespective of the gender.        
	Five women have won Nobels this year  the biggest haul yet. The previous record was in 2004 when three women received the prizes -- Linda Buck from the US for medicine, Austrias Elfriede Jelinek for literature and Kenyas Wangari Maathai for peace.        
	The leap from three to five reflects another change: in 2004, only one prize was in science. This year, out of the five Nobels, four are in so-called male-dominated research subjects: chemistry, medicine and economics.         
	That statistical nugget may hold a lesson for economist Lawrence Summers, former Harvard University president and now director of the National Economic Council under the Obama administration.         
	Summers had offended many in academic circles four years ago when he suggested that one reason why women are under-represented in sciences could be the different availability of aptitude at the high end.         
	Among the 41 women who have received the prizes since 1901, 10 have received it for physiology and medicine, 12 for literature and 12 for peace. The patterns appear to be consistent with surveys that suggest women continue to be under-represented in faculty and research positions across the sciences.        
	A report earlier this year from the US National Research Council found a stubborn and persistent under-representation of women at all faculty ranks.         
	The report found that the representation of women who hold positions of full professors in biology at leading US academic centres had climbed from 14.7 per cent to only 20.8 per cent between 1995 and 2003. The proportion of women who are full professors in physics crawled from 4.3 per cent to 7.6 per cent.        
	Another unusual feature of this years Economics Nobel is that Ostroms background is in political science, not economics.        
	It is part of the merging of the social sciences, said Robert Shiller, an economist at Yale. Economics has been too isolated and these awards today are a sign of the greater enlightenment going around. We were too stuck on efficient markets and it was derailing our thinking.        
	With reports from Devadeep Purohit, G.S. Mudur, Reuters and New York Times News Service

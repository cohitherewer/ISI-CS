The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Land hurdles stall roads
                                                                                                           Land hurdles stall roads
  - State puts new projects on hold        AMIT GUPTA                            Widening project has hit the national highway near Ranchi                                        
	Ranchi, July 17: At least 40 road projects, ideated to improve travel experience and trade prospects within Jharkhand, are held up because of nagging land acquisition problems, prompting the departmental secretary, N.N. Sinha, putting a stop on new projects without mandatory land clearances.        
	The list of stalled projects include the ambitious Ranchi Ring Road project, the widening of Ranchi-Chaibasa national highway, the Asian Development Bank (ADB)-supported Govindpur-Sahebganj road and several other roads designated as state highways.        
	The engineer-in-chief of the road construction department, Vijay Kumar, told The Telegraph that Sinhas directives to clear land acquisition bottlenecks for ongoing projects and stop issuing tenders for new stretches to be widened had been passed on to district administrations.        
	The Rs 155 crore Ranchi Ring Road project  begun in June 2007  was stuck midway even though Rs 40 crore had been paid to contractors  a joint venture of Shrinet amp; Shandilya and Somdutt Builders  as advance.         
	But engineers associated with the project confided that not more than Rs 20 crore to Rs 25 crore had been spent so far as villagers of Nagri had prevented construction work, claiming rights to the land the proposed road was to pass through. Now, its unlikely to be completed by the June 2010 deadline.        
	The land in question was acquired by the then Bihar government in late 1950 for Birsa Agriculture University, but the varsity failed to take official possession during last five decades, leading to problems for the road project.        
	This meant that public funds were being locked up in an incomplete project, while district authorities did precious little to ensure that land needed for the road was freed up.        
	In case of the ADB-assisted Rs 1,064 crore Govindpur-Sahebganj road project, the state budget has earmarked Rs 250 crore, but officials admitted it could begin only when land acquisition issues were sorted out as per the banks norms. Last year, Rs 55 crore was set aside in the budget for the 311-km thoroughfare.        
	Other road projects held up included the Ranchi-Bariatu road, the Satsangnagar-Baijnathpur, the Ranchi-Chaibasa road and the Kumardungi road near Chaibasa.        
	A road department engineer pointed out that there existed an unholy nexus of contractors and a section of government engineers because of which tenders were rushed through to enable a few contractors to draw government funds in crores. After that the timely execution of the project is hardly their worry.        
	Several projects of the rural works department, especially those under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana being executed in Hazaribagh, Khunti and Latehar districts, were also held up because of land issues.         
	The departments engineer-in-chief, Jai Prakash, put the onus on the forest department, alleging it held up clearances. Also, the forest department tells us to lay kutchha roads instead of bituminous ones, he said.

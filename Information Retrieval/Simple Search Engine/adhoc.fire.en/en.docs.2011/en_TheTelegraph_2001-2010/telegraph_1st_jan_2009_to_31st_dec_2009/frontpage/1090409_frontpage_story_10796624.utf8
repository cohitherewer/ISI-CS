The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Sonia heaps shame on Singh-baiters
                                                                                                           Sonia heaps shame on Singh-baiters
          JOHN MARY                             Sonia Gandhi at a rally in Vadakara, Kerala. (PTI)                                  
	Thiruvananthapuram, April 8: Sonia Gandhi today said the Congress was fortunate to have Manmohan Singh as Prime Minister, a veiled dare to the BJP and the Left to show someone as capable.        
	We are fortunate to have a man like him as our Prime Minister, she said in remarks targeted at the BJPs candidate for Prime Minister, L.K. Advani, who has often taunted Singh as being weak.        
	The Congress chief hopped across rallies in Kerala, where crowds braved summer humidity to hear her speeches that had Singh as the key theme.        
	Setting off in a chopper from the northern constituency of Vadakara to Thrissur, Kottayam and Thiruvananthapuram in the south, Sonia addressed crowds with a single appeal: vote for Manmohan Singh.        
	The pitch for the Prime Minister made, it was time to remind people about Advanis record as home minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government.         
	They (the NDA government) released a dreaded terrorist and escorted him to Kandahar. He went back to Pakistan and launched the attack on our Parliament. Whereas, in the aftermath of the 26/11 attack in Mumbai, our government mounted a diplomatic offensive on Pakistan, making it admit the terrorists were its citizens, she said.        
	It is a shame that the BJP and the Left attacked our Prime Minister, Sonia said. While he belongs to the Congress, he is the Prime Minister of the country, of all people, she added.        
	The Lefts record in power, too, came up during the speeches.         
	What have they (the Left) done in the past three years? The state (Kerala) has suffered stagnation because of their internal bickering. They are prisoners of an outdated mindset. They trampled on constitutional guarantees to minorities, she said in Thrissur, the seat of feuds between the CPM and the Catholic Church.        
	Sonia dismissed the Lefts claims to the good work done by the Centre when the comrades backed the UPA. She pointed out that the popular rural job scheme, the information act and other welfare plans were part of the last Congress manifesto.        
	Also mentioned at the rallies was an issue state Congress leaders havent forgotten to rake up in recent times: alleged corruption in the states Left-led government.        
	Sonia said even a state functionary of the CPM was not free from charges of corruption.         
	The allusion was to the alleged irregularities by Kerala CPM secretary Pinarayi Vijayan in a 1996 deal with Canadian power company Lavalin when he was power minister.

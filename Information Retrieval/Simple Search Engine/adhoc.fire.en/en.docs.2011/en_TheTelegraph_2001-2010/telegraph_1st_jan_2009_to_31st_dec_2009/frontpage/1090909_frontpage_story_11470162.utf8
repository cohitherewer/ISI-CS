	Sept. 8: Over 13,000 passengers were affected today as nearly half of the pilots of Jet Airways reported sick and grounded 184 flights to protest the dismissal of two colleagues for forming an association.        
	The airline struck back by sacking three more pilots, securing a high court order against the flash strike and sending doctors to the homes of pilots who said they were unwell. Jet claimed 70 per cent of the examined pilots were found fit to work.        
	However, till late tonight, the pilots had refused to withdraw their agitation.        
	Jet has cancelled 31 domestic and international flights scheduled for Wednesday. Among the 31  several are linked to Mumbai  is a Bangkok-Calcutta flight.        
	The pilots had last night said they were withdrawing the call for a strike but had warned of mass leave. The threat was activated this morning with devastating effect: 163 captains and 198 first officers or co-pilots reported sick, prompting the cancellation of 184 flights, including 32 international services.        
	Around 25 per cent of our domestic flights operated, a Jet executive said. Contract crew, mostly made of expats, operated the flights. The sick pilots represent over 47 per cent of Jets 760.        
	Air India accommodated several Jet passengers, the state-run airline earning some goodwill after months of financial turbulence and last weeks fire in a plane.        
	In Calcutta, several passengers were affected. Inderjit Singh Saini, a businessman scheduled to take a Jet flight to Delhi, said: All other flights were almost full and the rates were very high. I had to cancel an important business meeting in Delhi.

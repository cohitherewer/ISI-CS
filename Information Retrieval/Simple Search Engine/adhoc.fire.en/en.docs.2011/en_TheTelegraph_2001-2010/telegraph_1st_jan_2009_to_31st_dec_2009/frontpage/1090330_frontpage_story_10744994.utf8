  - Debate in Kashmir on legitimacy of hurling stones          MUZAFFAR RAINA                       A youth hurls a stone at police in Srinagar. (File picture)                                
	Srinagar, March 29: Stone-throwing, for long a potent weapon for anti-India demonstrators in Kashmir, is being put through a legitimacy test in the Valley.        
	Separatists belonging to the moderate and hardline camps are locked in a debate on whether stone-throwing has religious sanction.        
	Stone-hurling, the weapon of choice against tanks in West Asia that evokes Biblical connotations of David taking on Goliath with the sling, had found favour with protesting youths in Kashmir long before armed insurgency started in 1989. Even after guns became a part of the culture here, the stone did not lose its relevance.         
	The readily available missile gained prominence and became routine after last years Amarnath land agitation, which has now prompted separatists from the moderate camp to come out openly against its use.         
	Maulvi Showkat Hussain, chief of the Jamiat-e-Ahli Hadees, an influential religious group, has emerged as the most vocal opponent of stone-throwing, which has left hundreds injured over the past nine months.         
	How can we declare a thing lawful when our revered Prophet has declared it unlawful? I will tender an apology and take my words back if anybody proves otherwise, said Hussain, who is seen as a moderate.        
	The Jamiat chief quoted a saying of the Prophet from Sahi Bukhari, the most authentic Islamic book after the Quran. The Prophet forbade the throwing of stones and said it neither hunts a game nor kills an enemy but only damages the eye or teeth.         
	Hussain already has the support of Mirwaiz Umer Farooq, the chief priest of Kashmir, who has urged people to refrain from such acts.         
	But hardliners among the separatists are throwing stones, till now metaphorically so, at the moderate stand.         
	Leading this camp is Dukhtaran Milat chairperson Asiya Andrabi and Islamic Students League president Shakeel Ahmad Bakshi. Andrabi, a conservative who advocates the wearing of burkha by all women in Kashmir, heads the Milat, a separatist group for women.        
	On Sunday, Bakshi organised a group discussion, Haath Main Hain Pather Har Ek Ke (There is a stone in every hand), to prove his point.         
	No dissenting voice rose from among the 100-odd participants who felt that the stone was a legitimate weapon to carry forward what they called a freedom struggle. They said government agencies were not letting them hold peaceful protests and the use of stones was a natural fallout.         
	Bakshi said people who were opposing the seminar were collaborators of the government, and cited the trauma of Aamir Ayub, 13, who was arrested in February and allegedly sodomised. What is the way out for people like him who are abused and harassed? Bakshi asked.         
	The seminar is a part of our resistance and those who are issuing statements against it are supporters of killers and murders. The outcome of the meeting will be put before the people, he said.         
	Hurriyat hardiner Syed Ali Shah Geelani, who has in the past urged youths not to resort to stone pelting, now says this is a reaction to a very strong presence of security forces in Kashmir.         
	Stone pelting was bound to happen in the presence of an excessive number of troops. It will vanish perpetually once there are no troops, he said.        
	The issue has split the Kashmiris. It is the weapon of the weak. The Kashmiris have no other weapon to fight for their rights with, said Mohammad Arif, a businessman.         
	Aijaz Ahmad Beig, a shopkeeper at Bohri Kadal, however, said stone pelting should be put to an end. This is madness and how can it be approved by Islam. This has disturbed our peace and damaged our economy as well, he said.

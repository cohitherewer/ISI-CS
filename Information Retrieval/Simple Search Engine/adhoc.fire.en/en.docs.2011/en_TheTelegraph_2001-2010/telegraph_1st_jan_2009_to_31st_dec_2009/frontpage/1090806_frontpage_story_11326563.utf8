                                                                                                           Private flu-fight dilemma
  - Fear of excessive tests   versus govt limitations        G.S. MUDUR                             A child waits outside Naidu Hospital, Pune, to be tested for H1N1. (AP)                                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 5: Indias first death from pandemic flu has accentuated a public health paradox the country faces  an inherent danger and the inevitable need to involve the private sector in pandemic management, experts said today.         
	The death of 14-year-old Rida Sheikh in a private hospital in Pune on Monday after a delay in sending her throat swab samples for H1N1 diagnosis has amplified concerns about capacity within the private sector for pandemic flu management.         
	The health ministry has signaled its intention to regulate all diagnostic tests and treatment for the H1N1 virus by asking everyone with flu symptoms to visit government facilities in its revised guidelines issued yesterday. Medical experts believe the track record of Indias private medical sector in managing public health issues leaves the government with no other option  for now.         
	Public health experts are worried about the potential abuse of tests and treatment. There appears to be nothing else India can do at this point in the pandemic, said a senior specialist at the World Health Organisation in New Delhi.         
	Medical studies in the past have indicated that the widespread irrational use of drugs in India has contributed to the emergence of resistance to several infectious diseases including cholera, tuberculosis and typhoid.         
	A senior doctor in a government hospital in New Delhi recalled how during a dengue outbreak in the capital three years ago, he learnt about patients who had slightly depressed platelet counts who were admitted by private hospitals and monitored. They could have been asked to stay home and come back for a platelet count test a day later, said the doctor who asked not to be named.         
	The entry of the private sector in pandemic flu management without adequate training is likely to lead to widespread testing without real reason and the abuse of the antiviral drug (oseltamivir), another government doctor said.         
	But health officials and their medical advisers concede India will be compelled to turn to the private sector if the numbers of patients burgeon. The government facilities could be overwhelmed quickly, said a public health officer in Bangalore.         
	This is still a low virulence organism that is easily transmissible, said K. Srinath Reddy, the president of the Public Health Foundation of India. We have to be careful that high panic response does not erode health resources.        
	Medical experts also warn that the longer Indias private sector is out of the flu management loop, the greater the risk to public health. Private doctors need to be trained to screen people for serious illness so they can selectively recommend tests for those who appear to need them, said Randeep Guleria, a professor of medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi.         
	A senior doctor who has been consulted by the government on flu policy said he has told the health ministry that it should identify select private institutions and help them prepare their doctors and paramedical staff for a larger pandemic.         
	There are also non-trivial issues  the virus spreads through air and contact. Hospitals may have to prepare special areas for people with respiratory infections. You cant let them mingle in outpatient departments where the virus may spread.        
	The doctor said Ridas death in Pune suggested that sections of doctors in the private sector were still oblivious to signs of serious illness and the urgency to test for H1N1. He said the doctors treating her at the private hospital should have suspected H1N1 when she showed signs of pneumonia on the second day of her hospital stay.         
	(But the hospital claims it tried to send the girls throat swab samples for testing to Punes designated hospital  Naidu Hospital. Based on criteria for testing and the patients history of no contact (with an infected person), Naidu Hospital asked us not to send the samples, its medical superintendent Prasad Muglikar said.         
	All H1N1 cases in India have been mild. She had rapid spread of infection into her lungs  which mimicked atypical viral pneumonia and was not like the H1N1 infection observed in India until now, Muglikar said.        
	The number of cases of H1N1 today rose to 596 with 22 new patients confirmed as infected in 12 cities across the country. Almost all have had mild symptoms.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Another bailout for Vedic Modi
                                                                                                           Another bailout for Vedic Modi
          OUR BUREAU                                          
	Calcutta, Sept. 13: The Bengal government approved overnight a residential complex being built by the Vedic Village promoter on protected wetlands after pursuing till the Supreme Court a case against the same project, documents with The Telegraph reveal.        
	The approval for Sanjeeva Town, a residential complex of bungalows and apartments on the East Calcutta Wetlands, was given within a year of the land department reaching an out-of-court settlement on handing over vested land to the same promoter for building Vedic Village.        
	The promoter in both cases was Raj K. Modi, now in judicial custody on charges of links with criminals following the Vedic Village flare-up.        
	The clearance was given despite the state government objecting to Sanjeeva Town before a single bench and a division bench of Calcutta High Court. (See chart)        
	The governments opposition was based on two points: the land was part of East Calcutta Wetlands on which conversion and construction are prohibited by a Calcutta High Court order of 1993; the residential project had applied for  and been refused  permission to convert and construct on the wetland. East Calcutta Wetlands is designated a Ramsar site, which grants international environmental status.        
	However, on October 23, 2006, the authority meant to protect the wetlands held a meeting chaired by then chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb and gave post-facto (after the event) sanction that reversed the governments earlier position in the courts. A condition of creating compensatory water body was included.        
	With the state no longer opposed to the construction, the apex court, which had sought the Bengal governments opinion, cleared the project. Sanjeeva Towns Phase I is complete with the first few residents having moved in while the second leg is under construction. As many as 160 bungalows and 224 three- and four-bedroom duplex apartments are scheduled to be built.        
	Asked what made the government change its position, a pollution control board official said: The project area of Sanjeeva Town was first shown (in official records) as urban/rural settlement. Later, it was changed to substantial water bodies. We considered the original status and gave the clearance.        
	The official could not explain why the old entry was chosen when the project continues to be in an area designated substantial water bodies.        
	Modi and his legal counsel were present at the meeting of the East Calcutta Wetland Management Authority  set up to save the ecologically sensitive wetlands  that gave the approval. Then chief secretary Deb had chaired the meeting as the chairman of the authority. Other senior officials of the government and the state pollution control board, too, attended the meeting.        
	Deb, now retired from government service, declined to comment on the meeting he had chaired. I will not be able to say anything on that matter now, he said on Sunday evening.        
	Land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah, whose department had filed the FIR that led to the case, washed his hands of the issue.        
	I was never consulted when the East Calcutta Wetland Management Authority gave the approval to the project. In fact, I came to know about the development after the project was cleared by the Supreme Court. It was a completely wrong thing. It is clear that somewhere corruption played a role but I do not know exactly who to blame, Mollah told The Telegraph.        
	But the secretary of the land and land reforms department is a member of the East Calcutta Wetland Management Authority. For some reason, he was not present at the October 23 meeting.        
	Modi had approached a single bench of Calcutta High Court first when the land department filed an FIR alleging construction was being carried out without permission. The FIR had termed a panchayat clearance illegal and specified that the character of the land had been classified a wetland with fishery where construction would imply change of land use.        
	Modi received a favourable verdict from the single bench, following which the state government moved a division bench and got the sanction quashed. The promoters then moved the Supreme Court.        
	However, like the forgotten smallest detail that led Hercule Poirot to many a breakthrough, the original FIR had survived the twists and turns. It kicked back to life on Friday when Modis wife and son  part of the Sanjeeva board  sought and obtained bail.

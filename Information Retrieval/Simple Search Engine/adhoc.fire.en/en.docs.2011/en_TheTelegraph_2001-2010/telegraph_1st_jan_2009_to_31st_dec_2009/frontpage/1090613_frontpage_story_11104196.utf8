	London, June 12: Cristiano Ronaldo celebrated his world record 80million transfer from Manchester United to Real Madrid by partying in Hollywood with Paris Hilton.         
	Entertainment news website TMZ.com reported that Ronaldo and the socialite met at an exclusive Los Angeles nightclub, My House, before moving on to the home of Hiltons sister Nicky early yesterday.         
	Only hours earlier, Manchester United had confirmed it had accepted a 80-million bid from Real Madrid for the 24-year-old Portuguese winger.         
	The deal ends Reals two-year pursuit of Ronaldo, who learnt of Uniteds acceptance of the bid while in Los Angeles, where he is currently on holiday.         
	Hilton had previously been dating Doug Reinhardt, who has played baseball for Anaheim Angels and Baltimore Orioles, for six months but reports said they had split up 24 hours earlier.         
	Ronaldo is on holiday in California after the end of the English football season, which saw him win the Premiership with United but lose to Barcelona in the Champions League final in Rome.

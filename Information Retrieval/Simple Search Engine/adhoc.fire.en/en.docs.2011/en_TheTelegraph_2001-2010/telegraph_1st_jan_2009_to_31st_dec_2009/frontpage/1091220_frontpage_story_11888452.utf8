	London, Dec. 19: Around 2,000 passengers were trapped in the Channel Tunnel overnight as four Eurostar trains broke down amid freezing temperatures that have brought travel chaos to Britain.        
	It is thought trains  all headed to London from Paris  failed as they left the cold air in northern France and entered the warmer air inside the tunnel. Some passengers were stuck for 11 hours and two of the trains had no heating or lighting.        
	All the stranded passengers have since been taken out of the tunnel but services are not expected to resume, causing further chaos for cross-Channel passengers already hit by a strike by border officials that has forced the cancellation of some ferries.        
	The ports of Dover and Calais have also been closed due to the extreme weather conditions and Kent police issued an urgent warning for drivers to stay away from the Folkestone and Dover areas of the M20 highway. A cold weather front has caused major problems in parts of the UK in the last couple of days and further snow is forecast.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Engineers, brushed up in lab
                                                                                                           Engineers, brushed up in lab
          G.S. MUDUR                              
	New Delhi, May 31: The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, unhappy at conventional engineering education in India, will venture into formal education this year with a postgraduate engineering programme.        
	Eight CSIR laboratories will introduce an education and research programme for engineering graduates who will be paid while they pursue the course and receive a postgraduate diploma at the end of two years.        
	The initiative aims to create a new cadre of postgraduate engineers who have learnt from working scientists and live projects, said officials at the CSIR, a government-funded network of 38 laboratories.        
	It is also intended to tackle a severe shortage in India of engineers skilled enough to take on ambitious research goals. And it reflects the CSIRs dissatisfaction at the current quality of PG engineering training.        
	We need doctorates (PhD holders) in engineering to plan and execute large and ambitious research targets, but were not getting enough of them, said Samir Brahmachari, CSIR director-general.        
	About 280 engineers with PhDs now do research in various CSIR laboratories. Some 20 to 25 of them retire each year without replacements coming in.        
	The shortage of engineering PhD-holders is a nation-wide affliction. Indias universities and engineering institutes, including the IITs, produce only about 1,000 PhDs in engineering each year. Technology analysts estimate the country needs at least 6 to 10 times that number to support its myriad technology development programmes and serve as faculty in private engineering colleges.        
	Scientists are also worried at the calibre of PG engineers. Typically, theyre not up to date and thus not equipped for research careers, said Chandra Shekhar, director of the Central Electronics Engineering Research Institute, Pilani, one of the eight CSIR labs that will launch the PG diploma programme.        
	The programme, open to BTech and BE graduates, will have a tuition fee of Rs 48,000 a year, but each student will receive a monthly stipend of Rs 24,000. It will touch multiple engineering areas, from aerospace and electronics to materials sciences and petrochemicals. The first batch is expected to join by September.        
	Since the CSIR is not authorised to grant degrees, it will award a diploma. Some of the (successful) students will be absorbed into the CSIR; the rest will be available for industry or other organisations, Brahmachari said.        
	Laboratory directors believe the market will accept the CSIR diploma. (Some) prestigious management institutions also award diplomas, Shekhar said. These students will be exposed to cutting-edge research, equipment and facilities not available with many universities or engineering colleges.        
	Some academics have criticised the initiative. Nowhere in the world has science progressed without universities, said Kasturi Lal Chopra, former IIT Kharagpur director.         
	Most of the work in such laboratories is highly focused. Will the engineers receive a broad enough education that will make them acceptable to other institutions?        
	Chopra said the introduction of education by government research labs might contribute to the erosion of Indias universities.

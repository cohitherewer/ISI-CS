The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Eat, pray, love, with Julia
                                                                                                           Eat, pray, love, with Julia
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                            Crew members at Hari Ram Ashram, where Eat, Pray, Love is being filmed. Prem Sigh                                  
	Pataudi (Haryana), Sept. 24: Few names could be more apt than Eat, Pray, Love for the film Julia Roberts is shooting in this village, 60km from Delhi.        
	Roberts eats with the crew; the villagers can pray in the temple at Hari Ram Ashram, where she is shooting; and as for love, the Hollywood star seems to have won over everyone, from the Indian unit hands to the villagers.        
	A group of crew members taking a short break outside the sets yesterday contrasted Robertss down-to-earth dignity with the airs and tantrums they claimed to have witnessed while working with leading Bollywood ladies.        
	She (Roberts) sticks to the schedule given by the temple (so that local devotees arent inconvenienced). Her children never come on the sets when she is shooting, said one of them, asking not to be quoted.        
	She eats with the crew members and has just one bodyguard with her when she is on the sets.        
	He contrasted it with the reports of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt  while shooting for A Mighty Heart in Pune three years ago  dining upstairs with the films foreign crew while the Indian members ate downstairs.        
	I worked for Bride and Prejudice (featuring Aishwarya Rai), and the star there made us sweat. This lady (Roberts) throws no tantrums; she is concerned only about her work. She does her homework thoroughly a day before she is to act a scene, said an Indian production hand.        
	Another production hand said he had seen Roberts move around barefoot within the ashram, and that she often refused her car and walked the 500 metres to the Pataudi Palace, where she is staying with her children.        
	Villagers denied reports that the temple had been closed to worshippers for the shoot. I have a grocery just outside the ashram. The devotees come and go as always theres been no problem, said Sant Dev.        
	The Telegraph saw how the ashram, which draws at least 200 visitors daily, stayed open to everyone all day. Prayers were held at the temple as usual, attended by devotees, from 4am to 8am and from 6pm till 8pm.        
	If there were 350 guards, bullet-proof cars and a helicopter, they did a good job of hiding themselves. This reporter saw only one foreign security guard on the sets, and was told there is another who stays away from the site of the shoot.        
	There were two bouncers  both Indians  who kept a low profile and about 10 policemen, only two of whom were on the sets.        
	The school on the ashram premises held classes as usual. Students trooped in and out of the gates even as filming was on.                    Julia Roberts on the set of the film in Rome in August. (AP)       
	The sets are in an enclosed area; we arent allowed to go there. The school is on the other side, so we go straight there, said Sundari, mother of an eight-year-old pupil, adding that she would return with her entire family for the evening prayers.        
	Today, we had been called to a parent-teacher meeting. I saw a firang woman; she walked past me and smiled, and I smiled back.        
	It was possibly Roberts herself  and the fact that she would be less recognisable in an Indian village than, say, a Bollywood actress may have helped keep her security less obtrusive.        
	In the city of Pune, however, Sindh Society, where Jolie and Pitt stayed in 2006, was turned into a fortress by an army of foreign guards and local police. Residents of the complex and their school-going children had to use passes to leave and enter the premises.        
	While journalists were not allowed anywhere near A Mighty Hearts sets, this reporter was given full access to the entire ashram with just a polite request not to click photographs of the sets or give away the scenes being shot.

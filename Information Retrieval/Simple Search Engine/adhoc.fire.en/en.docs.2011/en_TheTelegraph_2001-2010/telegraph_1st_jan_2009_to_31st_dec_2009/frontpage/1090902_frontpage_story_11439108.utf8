The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | 8 courts to curb corruption
                                                                                                           8 courts to curb corruption
  - Ranchi, Dhanbad get two each to expedite CBI cases          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA      
	Ranchi, Sept. 1: Building on the governors zero tolerance for corruption mantra, the state will play host to eight more special courts to expedite hearing of anti-corruption cases pending for years.        
	Ranchi and Dhanbad, plagued by piling cases, will get two courts each. These will exclusively try and decide cases lodged by the CBI.         
	The remaining four  coming up at Jamshedpur, Daltonganj, Dumka and Hazaribagh  will attend to cases lodged by the state vigilance bureau.        
	The four new CBI courts will be among the 71 sanctioned by the law ministry for speedy disposal of anti-corruption cases across the country.         
	State law secretary P.R. Das said he had already forwarded a government notification for setting up of the special courts to Jharkhand High Court. Adviser to the governor, G. Krishnan, confirmed this.        
	Currently, there is one CBI court in Ranchi to conduct anti-corruption trials and two more in Dhanbad.         
	There are also seven special CBI courts in the capital to hear fodder scam cases.         
	For vigilance trials, two courts function in Ranchi and Dhanbad.         
	Besides, the state has already decided to set up six special courts to try power theft cases in Dhanbad, Hazaribagh, Ranchi, Jamshedpur, Dumka and Daltonganj.         
	According to a CBI officer, at present, over 500 CBI cases are pending in Ranchi and Dhanbad alone. We file chargesheets on time, but trials drag on, he said, adding that verdicts of corruption cases often came after 18 years.         
	On an average, investigation takes two years. Eight years are spent on trial and another eight passes by before the high court or the Supreme Court pronounces the verdict, he added.                          
	No wonder the 17th biennial conference of the anti-corruption bureau and CBI on August 26-27 resolved to ask the state to establish adequate number of special courts for prevention of corruption cases.        
	Tardy pace of work has hit fodder scam cases the hardest, particularly because the number of special judges conducting trials has been reduced to four from seven.         
	The special courts are also manned by officers of additional district judge rank.         
	Inadequate number of judges has slowed down trials. We hope the high court will fill up vacancies soon, said CBI lawyer Ravi Shankar.        
	Records show that out of 53 fodder scam cases, which are under investigation and trial in Jharkhand, 33 have been disposed of. But these are the ones in which only animal husbandry officials and suppliers were involved.         
	The pending include five that involve high-profile accused, including Lalu Prasad, Jagannath Mishra and half a dozen IAS officers. These are still at an early trial stage.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Aniston life follows her films
                                                                                                           Aniston life follows her films
          MATTHEW MOORE                            Aniston: Looking for a stable male                                  
	London, June 15: Jennifer Aniston joked that she wants to star in a film called Everlasting Love With An Adult Stable Male, after noticing that her off-screen love life mirrors the titles of her films.         
	The Friends actress, 40, has been through a series of failed romances since her divorce from Hollywood heart-throb Brad Pitt in 2005  which came around the time she was filming Derailed and The Break-Up.        
	While she was failing to find happiness in relationships with actor Vince Vaughn, musician John Mayer and model Paul Sculfor, Aniston was working on Hes Just Not That Into You.        
	Now the actress wants her next film to have a more positive title and help her find long-term love with a reliable man.        
	Speaking to reporters while accepting an award at the Women in Film ceremony in Los Angeles, Aniston made light of her rocky relationship history.        
	Its funny, I kinda noticed a couple of years ago that there seemed to be this strange parallel to the movies I was doing and my life off screen, she said.        
	It started with, well The Good Girl. That evolved into Rumour Has It, followed by Derailed and The Break-Up.        
	So if any of you have a project thats titled Everlasting Love With An Adult Stable Male...        
	Pitt left Aniston after falling in love with Angelina Jolie on the set of Mr And Mrs Smith in 2004. They have always denied having an affair, insisting that their relationship only began after Pitt and Aniston were divorced.        
	Aniston reportedly ended her relationship with Mayer earlier this year because he became obsessed with Twitter.        
	Replying to a question on whether she wants to direct more films, Aniston said she wants to don the directors cap again as she enjoyed the process while making the short film Room 10.        
	Aniston, who was honoured for expanding the role of women in the entertainment industry, said that she would love to direct again.        
	Aniston co-directed Room 10, an 18- minute short movie with filmmaker Andrea Buchanan starring Robin Wright Penn and Kris Kristofferson last year.        
	 When asked if she had any future goals after so much success the actress jokingly said: None! Im done!.         
	But she soon added that she is hoping to try her hand at helming a full length feature film now. I want to direct again, very soon, she said. I had so much fun doing that short film, and Im really ready to do it again, the actress said.                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

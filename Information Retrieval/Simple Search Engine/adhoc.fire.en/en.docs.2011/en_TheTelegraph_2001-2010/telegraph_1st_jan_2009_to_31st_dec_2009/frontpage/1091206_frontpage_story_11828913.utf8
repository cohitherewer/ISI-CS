          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 5: India may unconditionally exempt globally reputable universities from almost all provisions of a proposed law to regulate foreign varsities under fresh modifications recommended by the Prime Ministers Office to attract these institutions.         
	The latest draft of the law, which will be vetted by a panel of bureaucrats, exempts select foreign institutions from all but one provision, under alterations based on the PMOs suggestions, The Telegraph has learnt.        
	The select institutions  like all other foreign universities  will not be allowed to repatriate surplus revenues to their home country, and will have to reinvest any profits into institutions within India.        
	But the select institutions  mentioned under a separate clause of the bill  can be exempted from any other provisions of the act without a condition that the earlier draft imposed, officials said.        
	The earlier version of the bill granted exemption to reputable institutions from its provisions only if they invest not less than 51 per cent of the total capital investment for setting up the institution in India. But the latest draft of the human resource development ministrys bill  under consideration of a committee of secretaries  omits this condition.         
	This modification is the result of apprehensions from the PMO that the 51 per cent condition would deter top institutions from collaborating with Indian entities.        
	Government sources said there may be world-class institutions of high repute who may not like to control institutions but merely collaborate for improving the quality of Indian institutions.        
	Imposing provisions of the proposed act on such institutions of repute would hurt public institutions in India which may not require investment by world class institutions while collaborating with them, an official said.        
	Exemptions from the proposed law will be granted on a case-by-case basis by a panel of experts which will scrutinise applications from foreign institutions and evaluate the merit of their demand.         
	The government sources said the move was aimed at benefiting only renowned institutions  like Oxford, Cambridge or the Ivy League universities. But the bill does not lay down any specific parameters on the basis of which an institution will be categorised as one of repute.        
	Based on the recommendations of the PMO, the government has also made other modifications to the bill  starting with its name. The words maintenance of quality and prevention of commercialisation are being dropped from the name of the bill.        
	Earlier called the Foreign Educational Institutions (Regulation of Entry and Operations, Maintenance of Quality and Prevention of Commercialisation) Bill, the draft legislation is now titled the Foreign Educational Institutions (Regulation of Entry and Operations) Bill.        
	Maintenance of quality and prevention of commercialisation  bedrock of the Indian education policy  will be taken care of by the regulation of entry and operations, the government sources said.        
	The University Grants Commission or its successor  the proposed National Commission for Higher Education and Research  had powers to inspect foreign institutions here under the earlier draft.        
	Under the draft before the committee of secretaries, Indian regulators will no longer have the power to inspect foreign institutions. But it will be mandatory for foreign institutions to disclose details of their fees and admission process.        
	The earlier draft named the central government as the appellate authority to which foreign institutions could complain. Under the new draft, education tribunals  proposed under a separate law  will act as appellate authorities.        
	Since the bill specifies that all other domestic Indian laws will be applicable on these institutions, clauses referring to national security interests and linguistic sensitivities are being dropped from the earlier draft.

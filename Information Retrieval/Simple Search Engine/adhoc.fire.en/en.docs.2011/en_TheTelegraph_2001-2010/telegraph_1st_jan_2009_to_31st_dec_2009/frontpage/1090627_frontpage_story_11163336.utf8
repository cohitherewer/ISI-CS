The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | CPM backs Buddha on ban, with riders
                                                                                                           CPM backs Buddha on ban, with riders
          BISWAJIT ROY                                              
	Calcutta, June 26: The CPM state secretariat today endorsed the chief ministers decision to enforce the central ban on Maoists, ending the ambiguity over the party stand.        
	However, it hastened to clarify that there would be no widespread arrests, nor would the decisions be left in the hands of police on the ground.        
	Yes, we have endorsed the chief ministers decision, but the law (ban) will be implemented not at random but selectively as required, secretariat member Benoy Konar said.        
	The chief minister has made it clear that the decision to use the ban, and the subsequent arrests, will not be left to police station constables but will be dealt with at the highest level. The Centre has been told we are cautious since such laws have been misused in the past, said Mohammad Salim, another secretariat member.        
	The clarifications are meant to allay the opposition to the ban from Left Front allies and the uneasiness among many CPM leaders about being seen to be too close to the Centres stand on suppressing the Maoists. Even yesterday, CPM state secretary Biman Bose had been equivocal about the ban.        
	The Left Front, of which Bose is the chairman, had yesterday decided the bans implementation would be discussed at Mondays core committee meeting between senior ministers from the CPM and its partners.        
	Konar and Salim denied any differences within the party over the ban but their comments betrayed the CPMs fears of the political costs of conforming to the Centres prescription.        
	We are still saying that a ban is no solution to the Maoist problem. Neither are we offering any blanket support to the ban. But the state is bound to enforce the ban since its applicable all over the country, Salim said.        
	The secretariat made up its mind after discussing opinions and counter-opinions at a meeting where Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee explained his stand.        
	He said the forces had been warned against indiscriminate firing, which could claim innocent lives as in Nandigram.        
	We have to be patient since it will take time to achieve area domination and bring back normality through non-police activities, Bhattacharjee was quoted as saying. He cited how people in Lalgarh were being supplied foodgrains and said his government was gearing up for development projects in the area.        
	He asked the party to restrain its local leaders from trying to immediately regain the turf recovered by the forces.        
	Sources said the secretariat did not discuss changes to the ministry, but a shuffle was on the cards as part of efforts to regain lost support.        
	The sources said Sushanta Ghosh, the West Midnapore strongman and minister for development of the tribal districts, was likely to be replaced.        
	Bhattacharjee has decided to visit the districts regularly to sharpen the administrative delivery mechanism.         
	Party units have been asked to launch campaigns highlighting popular grievances  for instance, over ration cards and the rural job scheme  while mostly blaming babus and bureaucrats.        
	Caution on artistes        
	The secretariat has cautioned Bhattacharjee against arresting the artistes led by Aparna Sen who allegedly violated Section 144 by visiting Lalgarh.        
	Although they ignored the chief secretarys request not to visit Lalgarh, we dont want to open a second front in the war against the Trinamul-Maoist combine by arresting them, a secretariat member said.        
	Chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti, who had yesterday said the law was the same for everyone, today clarified he wasnt hinting at arresting the artistes.

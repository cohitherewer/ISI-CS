The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Same strokes but sign of hope
                                                                                                           Same strokes but sign of hope
                                            
	An 8ftx8ft wall fencing a two-storeyed house on Pratapaditya Road in south Calcutta tells the tale of the helplessness of tenants.        
	This wall has a history of being defaced during every election but some occupants had thought this time it would be spared because the landlord does not stay in the neighbourhood and the Election Commission has specified that consent should be sought from owners, not tenants.        
	One of the tenants of the building is a widow whose husband used to oppose slogan-writing on walls but had been humiliated.        
	This time also, the wall was defaced in front of her. Six days ago, she noticed two youths painting the wall in favour of Rabin Deb in the presence of a local party leader.         
	I asked them to stop but they didnt listen. Considering that I have to stay in the locality, I chose to keep mum, the lady said.         
	The owner of the house lives in Bhowanipore. The tenants cannot give permission but they  like any citizen  have the right to file a complaint        
	But like her fellow tenants, the widow, whose daughters live with their husbands elsewhere, does not want to court the wrath of party activists.        
	I have realised that such protests dont work. My husband used to object to wall graffiti, but no political party ever cared about such objections, she said.        
	Her husband, who died six years ago, had to face humiliation for raising his voice against wall graffiti, she said. We had got used to the fact that some party or the other would deface walls with political messages, the lady added.        
	But she saw a ray of hope when officers of Tollygunge police station visited her last week to enquire whether she or anyone in the house had given permission for the graffiti on the wall.         
	I was pleasantly surprised and told them that no one sought any permission. I requested them to take stringent action against the violators, she added.

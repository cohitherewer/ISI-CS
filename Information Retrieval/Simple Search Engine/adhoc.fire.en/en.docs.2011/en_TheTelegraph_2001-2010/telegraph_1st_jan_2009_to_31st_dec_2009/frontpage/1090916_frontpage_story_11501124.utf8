	Washington, Sept. 15: Patrick Swayze, 57, the actor who enjoyed success in Hollywood as the snake-hipped charmer of Dirty Dancing and a romantic lead from beyond the grave in Ghost, died yesterday, his publicist reported from Los Angeles. He had pancreatic cancer.        
	A former ballet and Broadway dancer, Swayze rarely received more than tepid reviews for his onscreen emotional range. But he found enduring mass approval for a handful of movie roles that took advantage of his muscular build, tousled hair and charismatic swagger.        
	Rita Kempley, a former Washington Post film critic, once described Swayzes appeal as a cross of Brando and Balanchine. From the neck up, he looks like a guy who could fix your carburetor; from the neck down he has the body of an Olympian.        
	Swayzes best-remembered movies  Dirty Dancing (1987) with Jennifer Grey and Ghost (1990) with Demi Moore  were unexpected hits that relied more on terrific soundtracks and appealing performances than dramatic plausibility.        
	Dirty Dancing featured Swayze as a dangerously hunky Catskills dance teacher named Johnny Castle who teams with a guests shy daughter for a dance performance at a neighbouring hotel. They also fall in love.        
	Swayze co-wrote and sang a hit song from the film, Shes Like the Wind. Film critic Vincent Canby, writing in the New York Times, said Swayze was at his best  as is the movie  when hes dancing.        
	Dirty Dancing made a fortune at the box office, a fact largely attributed to female ticket-buyers wowed by Swayze. Eleanor Bergstein, the films writer and co-producer, told Parade magazine: I wanted a hooded quality in the eyes  someone a father would never want for his daughter.        
	When she saw Swayze, Bergstein said: I told him I couldnt imagine doing the movie without him.        
	After several action films, Swayze eagerly accepted the role of an investment banker in Ghost. His character, killed during a robbery, helps his lover (Moore) solve the crime with the aid of a psychic played by Whoopi Goldberg. A signature moment showed Swayzes dead character embracing Moore as Unchained Melody swells.        
	Despite brief success as a heartthrob, Swayzes career remained uneven. He was a philosophy major turned bouncer in Road House (1989); a Chicago police officer avenging his brothers murder in Next of Kin (1989); and a disillusioned Texas doctor in City of Joy (1992).

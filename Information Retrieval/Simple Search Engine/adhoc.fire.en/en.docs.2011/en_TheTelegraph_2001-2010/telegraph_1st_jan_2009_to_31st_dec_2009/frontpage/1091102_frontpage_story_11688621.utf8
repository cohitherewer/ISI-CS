The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | IIT cell faces power loss
                                                                                                           IIT cell faces power loss
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 1: The Centre plans to strip the IITs apex decision-making body of its powers to select institute directors less than a year after Madras High Court indicted the government for bypassing this authority.        
	The proposed amendment to the IIT Act runs counter to government claims of providing greater autonomy to the institutes, because the appointments  the domain of the IIT Council  will now be handled by the Centre itself.        
	The move is controversial because the high court had last December stalled the reappointment of IIT Madras director M.S. Ananth for a second term on the ground that the appointment had not been approved by the IIT Council.        
	Documents accessed subsequently by The Telegraph revealed that the human resource development (HRD) ministry had not approached the council for the appointment of any IIT director over five years, as was reported on December 25 last year.        
	Then HRD minister Arjun Singh had used his position as chairman of the IIT Council to pick the bodys nominees without even informing the other council members.        
	The documents had cast a shadow over the appointments of all IIT directors, which the government tried to rectify by hurriedly calling a council meeting where these appointments were approved post facto.        
	Section 17 of the IIT Act, 1961, says: The director of each institute shall be appointed by the council with the prior approval of the Visitor (the President of India).        
	The proposed amendment to the section will delete the role of the council and will read: The director of each institute shall be appointed with the prior approval of the Visitor (the President of India).        
	The HRD ministry argues the amendment was proposed because it is unrealistic to call frequent meetings of the council to approve selections. But the move and this argument contradict new HRD minister Kapil Sibals stated desire to increase the autonomy of the IIT system.        
	At present, the HRD ministry appoints a search-cum-selection committee each time the post of a director falls vacant. This committee shortlists candidates, interviews them and indicates its nominee. Under current law, this nominee must be approved by the President and the IIT Council to become director.        
	To try and end allegations that the search process can be doctored by the government  as it appoints the selection team  Sibal has proposed creating a collegium of experts. The collegium will search out candidates and recommend names to the government.        
	However, through the proposed amendments to the IIT Act, the ministry will effectively take on powers that under the present law rest with the council  the authority to accept or reject any collegium proposal.

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Guwahati, Dec. 10: Suspected Bodo militants carried out two blasts in Assams Sonitpur district this afternoon, leaving a 12-year-old boy dead and 36 injured.        
	The first explosion at Garubandha weekly market, 100 metres from Missamari police station, at 2.30pm left one dead and 34 injured while the second one at Rakshasmari under Dhekiajuli police station at 6pm left two injured.        
	Preliminary investigations suggested that both the blasts were carried out by suspected militants of the National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB).         
	At the Garubandha market, which was milling with people at that time, the rebels exploded a grenade. The market is located 5km from the army cantonment at Missamari and is adjacent to the Garubandha primary health centre. The 12-year-old who died in the explosion was identified as Anuj Kumar Gaur. He died on way to Kanaklata civil hospital in Tezpur. Of the injured, 31 were admitted to the civil hospital while three were rushed to the Gauhati Medical College and Hospital.         
	At Rakshasmari, a low intensity bomb was exploded near a grocery shop owned by Montu Nandi. The police said it was probably kept inside a bag near the shop. The two injured, identified as Saidul, 25, and Nur Islam, 35, were admitted to Dhekiajuli hospital.         
	Sonitpur deputy commissioner Rajesh Prasad told this correspondent, Today was the day of the Garubandha weekly market. The police have told me that it was a Chinese grenade. We have intensified operations in the area that borders Arunachal Pradesh. It could be the handiwork of NDFB militants.         
	Bireswar Kalita, the joint director of health services, Sonitpur, said, Of the three rushed to the GMCH with eye, chest and neck injuries, a 13-year-old boy, Dipankar Sahu, may lose an eye. We will have to carry out the post-mortem of the deceased who did not suffer any external injuries.        
	Doley, Prasad and deputy inspector-general S.N. Singh rushed to Garubandha market to take stock of the situation.         
	AGP leaders Apurba Bhattacharjee and Padma Hazarika also visited the site and wondered where the government was.         
	The twin blasts shattered the lull in the district following the October 4 Bhimajuli massacre and came a day before the conclusion of the five-day Assembly session tomorrow.         
	Chief minister Tarun Gogoi condemned the blasts this evening and ordered strengthening of security measures in the state.         
	Incidentally, the blasts come just days after Jitmal Doley took charge as Sonitpur superintendent of police. He was among the several police officers transferred in the recent reshuffle and was the Nalbari SP when twin blasts claimed seven lives in the district on November 22.

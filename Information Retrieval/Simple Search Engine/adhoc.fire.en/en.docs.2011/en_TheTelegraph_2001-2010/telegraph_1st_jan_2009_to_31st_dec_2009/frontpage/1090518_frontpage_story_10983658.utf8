The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | AICC opens up communication line with Gogoi baiter
                                                                                                           AICC opens up communication line with Gogoi baiter
  - Ajmal will not only help Cong cross majority mark but aid party to reach out to Muslim voters, feels insider          A STAFF REPORTER                                           
	Guwahati, May 17: The bete noire in state politics is now poised to be the friend in need at the Centre.         
	A day after chief minister Tarun Gogoi admitted that the Assam United Democratic Front (AUDF) had become a factor to reckon with, AICC leaders sent feelers to its chief, Badruddin Ajmal, to support the coalition and be a part of the next government to be headed by Manmohan Singh.         
	The AUDF, which held its own despite pressures to merge with the Congress, won one of the nine seats it contested in the Lok Sabha elections but spoiled the prospects of the Congress in as many as four. Ajmal is the AUDFs lone winner but the party led in as many as 27 Assembly segments, confirming its growing clout within just three years of existence.         
	The party also has 10 legislators in the Assam Assembly.         
	Though the state Congress leadership  PCC president Bhubaneswar Kalita and chief minister Tarun Gogoi  has not said anything much beyond AUDF becoming a factor and that it was welcome to support the UPA, Congress insiders here said a line of communication was opened with Ajmal once the party think tank suggested getting Independents and smaller parties on board to cross the magical majority mark of 272 instead of having bigger and more demanding parties as part of the coalition.         
	Ajmal is the type of candidate we are looking for. An MP like him will not only help us cross the majority mark but would also help us reach out to the Muslim voters who have been moving away from us, an insider said. This explains why the Congress was so keen to woo a man who had openly said he would support a Third Front government.         
	Ajmal was unavailable for comment, being busy discussing the results and future course of action with the AUDFs core committee members, MLAs and candidates here. But AUDF youth president Aminul Islam claimed that at least one senior AICC leader had called up Ajmal requesting him to support or join the government. Islam did not name the leader at this juncture.         
	Ajmal saab himself told me about the development. Others from Delhi are also calling since parties with fewer MPs or Independents are being sought after yesterdays results as they will not be as demanding. However, a decision to this effect by our decision-making body is expected by tomorrow, he said.         
	AUDF working president H.R.A. Choudhury confirmed that senior state Congress leaders had called up Ajmal. Though we want to play a positive role, a decision will be taken by the party, he said.         
	That ties between the two parties were on the mend was indicated by Islam when he said if the AUDF supported or joined the next government, one should not be surprised because it had been supporting the UPA  whether it was backing Manmohan Singh for a Rajya Sabha seat from Assam or Pratibha Patil for presidentship  earlier too.         
	AUDF sources said a senior party leader today mooted an alliance with the Congress in both Delhi and Dispur because it was imperative in an era of coalition politics. However, the AUDF would in no case give up its identity, they added.

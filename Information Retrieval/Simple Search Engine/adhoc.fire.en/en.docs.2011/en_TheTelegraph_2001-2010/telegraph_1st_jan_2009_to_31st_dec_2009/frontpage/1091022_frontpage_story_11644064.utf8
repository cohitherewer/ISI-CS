	Calcutta, Oct. 21: As the elderly man placed a gentle hand on her head, the little girl looked up through tear-puffed eyes.        
	Dont cry, your father will come home soon, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee comforted Oindrakshi.        
	The two-year-old hadnt stopped crying since Maoists took her police officer father hostage yesterday.        
	Today, when she went with her mother, grandparents and uncle to meet the chief minister, Bhattacharjees first words to abducted officer-in-charge Atindranath Duttas wife was: Ma, chinta koro na.        
	Have a little patience, he told Indrani. We will not do anything that could harm your husband.         
	Then he had put his hand on Oindrakshis head.        
	My daughter has been crying all day, Indrani said at her parental home in north Calcutta after the meeting with Bhattacharjee at Writers. He gave us a patient hearing and said everything would be fine.        
	Her father-in-law Ashok Dutta said the chief minister had told them he would ensure the case is handled sympathetically.        
	It is a sensitive case and he said it would be handled in a manner that will cause no harm to my son, Dutta said.        
	Since last night, the family has been huddled at the Joy Mitra Street house, Indranis home before her marriage. Every time the phone rang, their hearts leapt.        
	But the sole solace so far has been Maoist leader Kishanjis offer to let one member of the family visit the 35-year-old officer.        
	Kishanjis offer indicates my son is still safe, Dutta said. We respect his assurance.        
	But the family, the retired bank employee added, hadnt decided who would go.        
	Atindranaths brother-in-law Sanjib said they told Bhattacharjee the family would be shattered if the kidnapped officer was not released.         
	He said he would keep the situation arising out of the abduction in mind and take steps accordingly. My sister also told him what Kishanji told us over phone. We are satisfied after talking with the chief minister, Sanjib said.        
	His sister, he said, has been inconsolable. But we forced her to have some dal-bhat (pulse and rice) today.        
	Dutta said his son was a brave and honest officer. When other police officers have been trying to get transfers out of Midnapore, my son kept shifting from one police station to another, be it Belpahari, Sabang, Moyna or Sankrail. He never shirked work but at the same time maintained cordial relations with local people, he said.        
	We request Kishanji to run a check in police stations where my son has been posted to find out if he ever indulged in cruelty or atrocity. He even used to fund a school in Belpahari. Since Kishanji is also a peoples leader, I wonder if capturing a person who also does good for people would serve his purpose.        
	Indrani stood in a corner, silent, eyes fixed on the floor. A little while later she left the room.

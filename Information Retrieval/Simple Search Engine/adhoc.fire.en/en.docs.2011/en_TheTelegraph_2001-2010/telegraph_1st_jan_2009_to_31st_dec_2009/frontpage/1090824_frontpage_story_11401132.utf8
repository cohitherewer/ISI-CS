The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Summit of discontent
                                                                                                           Summit of discontent
  - Joint statement upsets IFS          K.P. NAYAR                            Singh, Gilani                                
	Washington, Aug. 23: The first assertion of comprehensive no-confidence in the new UPA governments foreign policy will take place in New Delhi during five days from Monday when Indian ambassadors and high commissioners from all over the world gather in the capital for their second annual meeting.        
	There will, of course, be no resolutions expressing no-confidence. None of those who are attending the five-day meeting will even make a formal speech, on the record, criticising the government.        
	But in the bars and dining halls of the India International Centre, the Habitat Centre and other similar places in the capital that ring with synergetic discussions on current affairs, forthright disapproval of the Sharm-el-Sheikh Indo-Pakistan joint statement began during the weekend itself as Indias senior diplomats arrived ahead of their conference.        
	Such disapproval will continue to be expressed in private throughout the week from Monday in the drawing rooms of the Indian Foreign Service (IFS) Apartments in east Delhi and the governments D-1 and D-2 flats across the capital as Indian envoys on headquarters consultations are hosted by their colleagues in the diplomatic service.        
	In the five weeks since the controversial joint statement was issued on the sidelines of the non-aligned summit in Egypt, this correspondent has talked to scores of IFS officers, from ambassadors to counsellors to third secretaries across the world.        
	Speaking on background and assured of no attribution, not one  yes, not one  Indian diplomat approved of the joint statement which was issued in the name of Prime minister Manmohan Singh.        
	Every single IFS officer that this correspondent spoke to believes that Indias foreign policy interests were seriously damaged in Sharm-el-Sheikh.        
	Without even a solitary exception, they believe that the country will pay a price in the long run for the serious errors of judgement that were made during Singhs meeting with Pakistans Prime Minister, Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani, on July 16.        
	In the last several weeks, in many cities across the globe, Indian journalists have asked their ambassadors and high commissioners on record about the joint statement.                                      
	Uniformly, every envoy who was asked that question for attribution has simply referred to the prime ministers subsequent statement on the matter in the Lok Sabha on July 29.         
	No one was prepared to defend the statement beyond that. No further comment on the record, but a bland please read the Prime Ministers statement in Parliament.        
	Reporters all over the world are used to getting such answers from Chinese diplomats. Talking to a Chinese envoy in Berlin is the same as talking to another at the Chinese embassy in Canberra. They give the same standard answers by rote.        
	But in recent weeks, it was as if the IFS Association had circulated this please read the Prime Ministers statement in parliament directive to its members worldwide.        
	For only the second time in the history of the IFS, talking to an Indian diplomat was similar to seeking a response from a Chinese diplomat.        
	The first was when Rajiv Gandhi got rid of his foreign secretary, A.P. Venkateswaran, on television. Then too, like now, the entire IFS was of one view and was against the Prime Ministers decision.        
	Then again, like now, nothing was said in public against the government even though the IFS seethed in anger against the graceless removal of Venkateswaran.        
	The only speeches on record that were made then were within the closed doors of the IFS Association, but even there, the powers that be managed to water down the resolution which most of its members originally favoured.        
	That standard resolution became the response of the IFS. Like the please read the Prime Ministers statement in Parliament response today.        
	Does it matter that the entire body of Indian diplomats -- going by this correspondents informal survey, even allowing for a margin of error -- is opposed to what took place in Sharm-el-Sheikh? It does.        
	The unanimous view held by Indias diplomatic service on Pakistan will be significantly different in its fallout from the uniform view which the IFS had on Venkateswarans removal. After all, it is the Prime Ministers prerogative to take a final view on who the foreign secretary should be.        
	However, now, if Manmohan Singh intends to move forward in any big way on Pakistan on the lines of the Sharm-el-Sheikh statement, it is the IFS which will have to implement that policy.        
	Some 12 years ago, the Gujral doctrine of diluting Indian power in the sub-continent and going an extra mile to be nice to neighbours while those neighbours whipped New Delhi with impunity was comprehensively undermined by then Prime Minister I.K. Gujrals own diplomats, working in concert with those in the home ministry, the defence ministry and the intelligence agencies who shared a common view that the so-called doctrine was a recipe for disaster.        
	History may be about to repeat itself if the present Prime Minister believes that the country is ready to make a big leap into changing the course of Indo-Pakistan relations.

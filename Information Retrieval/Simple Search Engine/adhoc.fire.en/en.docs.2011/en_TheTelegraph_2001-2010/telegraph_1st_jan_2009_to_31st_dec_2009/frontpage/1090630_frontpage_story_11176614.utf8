	Ramgarh, June 29: An ill-prepared posse that set out to hunt down Maoists ran into a hail of bullets and was forced to fall back today  the first instance of a tactical retreat by central forces in Lalgarh and a portend of the pitfalls in letting the guard down.        
	The force that pulled back after coming under fire in the Godamouli forest in Sijua (see map) included 10 members of the Cobra, the unit that specialises in combating Maoists.        
	Caught in a series of explosions and sustained gunfire, the force  made of 10 Cobras and 50 BSF and state troopers  called off the mission for the day. On June 20, a state police team was beaten back at Kadashole. But the group that fell back today did not have jawans of the CRPF, which has more experience in battling the Naxalites.        
	The Cobra team had gone inside the forest in the morning looking for 30 to 35 bruised and beaten Maoists who, according to a tip-off, had left a hideout last night.        
	The Cobra team spotted the Maoists around 10am and alerted the Ramgarh camp. A 50-member team left for the jungle, said an official. A traditional CPM stronghold, Sijua is a forest-covered belt nestled between Pirakata and Goaltore.        
	As the forces were in a hurry to reach the forest, they did not wait to pick up mine sweepers. Two anti-landmine vehicles were being used by another group that was advancing towards Kantapahari.         
	Soon after entering the dense Godamouli jungle, the forces realised their mistake as five improvised explosive devices went off one after another. While the forces scurried to take cover, the Maoists used the smokescreen to take position and opened fire.         
	A central force source said the Maoists had ringed the forest hideout with inter-connected explosive devices that were detonated when they saw the forces approaching.        
	The Maoists detonated IEDs and then started firing at our men. We also fired and the gun battle continued for around an hour. After that, our men called off the mission and returned to the camp, said S.N. Gupta, DIG (operations), CID.         
	According to sources, although some state and central force officers wanted to launch an attack on the Godamouli forest with reinforcements this afternoon, the plan was shelved.        
	It was too late into the day and it had started raining as well. We would have got trapped in the forest had we proceeded this afternoon, said a state officer who added that a fresh plan was being drawn up to launch an assault on the forest.        
	He, however, admitted that todays guerrilla attack came as a surprise. The security establishment was hoping to outrun the Maoists in the forest by sending small Cobra teams to lie in wait for fugitives being pursued by other forces.        
	But the Maoists turned out to be smarter. While we had planned to wait for them in the jungle and attack them, they reached there ahead of us and caught us off guard, an officer conceded.

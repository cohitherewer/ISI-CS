	New Delhi, June 5: Where the BJP failed to convince Mamata Banerjee during its tenure at the Centre, the Congress and Sonia Gandhi appear to have succeeded.         
	Mamata has decided to leave her Delhi apartment of over a decade and move into a bungalow in Lutyens zone  an option she spurned during her tenure as railway minister in the NDA government.         
	A gentle request from the UPA chairperson may have proved a catalyst.        
	Sources close to the Trinamul Congress chief said Mamata had overcome initial reluctance to move out of her MPs apartment under pressure from her parliamentarians  and a nudge from Sonia.         
	The urban development ministry has been informed of Mamatas decision but it may take a few weeks before a bungalow is allocated, the sources said.         
	Senior MPs are entitled to bungalows along the broad boulevards of Lutyens Delhi. Mamata, as a cabinet minister and a six-time MP, is a senior member of the government.        
	Mamata lived in a bungalow at 5 Ashoka Road during Narasimha Raos premiership. She was initially a minister of state for human resource development, sports and youth affairs under Arjun Singh.         
	After her break from the Congress in 1997, Mamata was asked to move to her current apartment  C-4, MPs flats, Baba Kharag Singh Marg.         
	Under the NDA, Mamata was offered a ministerial bungalow but the Trinamul chief refused.        
	The partys housing stock fell further between 2004 and 2009, when, with Mamata as its sole MP, Trinamul had to make its leaders home its Delhi office too. Sources said that this time too, she was initially not too keen to shift, although her number of MPs had gone up.        
	But now Didi probably did not have much of a choice, especially after the Congress high command requested her to shift to a house appropriate for the office she holds, an aide said.         
	Trinamul MPs, including some of the six ministers of state from the party, also pleaded with their leader to heed the Congress request.        
	The ministers of state are themselves eligible for bungalows, but both the Congress and Trinamul are uncomfortable with a scenario where the junior ministers enjoy better accommodation than the party chief.         
	Unlike under the NDA, here Mamata also has to consider the aspirations of leaders who hold minister of state ranks and have applied for bungalows, an official said.        
	Trinamul has applied for a party office in Lutyens Delhi, sources said. The partys increased size in the Lok Sabha means Trinamul is likely to be offered a bungalow, allowing it to vacate Mamatas current apartment.         
	The party has also written to the Lok Sabha secretary-general requesting a large room inside Parliament for its office within the House.

	New Delhi/Ranchi, May 4: Three Maoists, wanted by the Jharkhand police, were arrested by a Delhi police special cell from the Badarpur area in the south of the national capital.        
	The three have been identified as Satish Kumar (20), Sheetal Kumar (20) and Yogendra Bhagota (26), all members of the banned CPI(Maoist) outfit. The three, among whom Yogendra was allegedly a zonal commander, operated from Jharkhand for the past 10 years.         
	Upon interrogation, they revealed they were in Delhi for Yogendras treatment for a bullet injury he had suffered in 2007.         
	The police claimed the trio had at least 16 cases registered against them in Jharkhand. Police said Yogendra and Satish were from Chatra, while Sheetal belonged to Bihar.        
	Jharkhand police spokesperson S.N. Pradhan said that a police team had been sent to the national capital to take the three rebels on remand to Jharkhand.        
	In February this year, Delhi police received a tip-off from their Jharkhand counterparts that Yogendra was hiding there. Intelligence inputs indicated Yogendra and his associates were living somewhere in the Badarpur area.        
	Accordingly, sources were deployed in Badarpur to locate Yogendra. Yesterday, acting on specific information, a raid was conducted at a house in and the three were arrested.         
	Post-interrogation, the police realised Yogendra was involved in several attacks on them in Jharkhand. After his injury, he assumed a fake identity  that of one Shiv Kumar  and was undergoing treatment at a hospital in Delhi. He also revealed that his associates Satish and Sheetal were involved in many criminal activities.         
	Meanwhile, around nine suspected Maoists abducted JVM(P) leader Mithilesh Kumar Srivastava (45) from Bhaluahi Middle School under Hunterganj police station of Chatra district around 9am today. The police said no ransom call had been received so far.

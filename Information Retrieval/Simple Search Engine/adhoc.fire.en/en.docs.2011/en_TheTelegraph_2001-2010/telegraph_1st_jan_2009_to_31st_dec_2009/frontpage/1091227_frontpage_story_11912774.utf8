          PAUL RODGERS AND RICHARD ALLEYNE                            Switch off pill                                  
	London, Dec. 26: An alcohol substitute that mimics its pleasant buzz without leading to drunkenness and hangovers is being developed by scientists.        
	The new substance could have the added bonus of being switched off instantaneously with a pill, to allow drinkers to drive home or return to work.        
	The synthetic alcohol, being developed from chemicals related to Valium, works like alcohol on nerves in the brain that provide a feeling of well-being and relaxation.        
	But unlike alcohol it does not affect other parts of the brain that control mood swings and lead to addiction.         
	It is also much easier to flush out of the body. Finally because it is much more focused in its effects, it can also be switched off with an antidote, leaving the drinker immediately sober. The new alcohol is being developed by a team at Imperial College London, led by Prof. David Nutt, Britains top drugs expert who was recently sacked as a government adviser for his comments about cannabis and ecstasy.        
	Nutt envisions a world in which people could drink without getting drunk, he said. No matter how many glasses they had, the drinkers would remain in that pleasant state of mild inebriation and at the end of an evening out, revellers could pop a sober-up pill that would let them drive home.        
	Nutt and his team are concentrating their efforts on benzodiazepines, of which diazepam, the chief ingredient of Valium, is one. Thousands of candidate benzos are already known to science. He said it is just a matter of identifying the closest match and then, if necessary, tailoring it to fit societys needs. Ideally, like alcohol, it should be tasteless and colourless, leaving those characteristics to the drink its in.        
	Eventually it would be used to replace the alcohol content in beer, wine and spirits and the recovered ethanol (the chemical name for alcohol) could be sold as fuel. Nutt believes that the new drug, which would need licensing, could have a dramatic effect on society and improve the nations health.

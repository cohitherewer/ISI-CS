The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | More Mumbai: Qaida
                                                                                                           More Mumbai: Qaida
          AMIT ROY                              
	London, Feb. 10: The blood of innocent victims is not even dry in Mumbai but India can expect more of the same if it attacks Pakistan, an al Qaida leader warned today in a chilling video handed to the BBC.        
	The threat has come from Mustafa Abu al-Yazid, who has risen Phoenix-like from the ashes because only last summer the Pakistani military, anxious no doubt to get the Americans off their back, announced that the al Qaida leader had been killed in fighting on August 13, 2008, in the Bajaur tribal area along the Pakistani-Afghan frontier.        
	Referring to Indias humiliation over Mumbai, Yazid, according to the BBCs translation of the Arabic, says in the video: India should know that it will have to pay a heavy price if it attacks Pakistan. The mujahideen will sunder your armies into the ground, like they did to the Russians in Afghanistan.        
	Yazid may not be familiar with the works of Mark Twain but the Egyptian-origin Islamic militant sent a message that had the touch of the reports of my death are greatly exaggerated.        
	The BBC report from Islamabad pointed out that Pakistani officials had thought that Yazid  or Mustafa Ahmed Muhammad Uthman Abu al-Yazid when the militant, born on December 17, 1955, affects his full name  may have died in August in the Bajaur tribal region. But in the new video he reappears to warn India it will be targeted in future Mumbai-style attacks.        
	Sources in the BBC said they were more interested in the sudden revelation that an al Qaida leader, thought to have been killed, had emerged into the land of the living. In the video, Yazid had threatened to use suicide bombers in India, just as al Qaida had done against the Pakistani army.        
	Believed to be al Qaidas military commander in Afghanistan, Yazid is said to have been involved in a number of terror attacks in Pakistan. They include last years Danish Embassy bombings in Islamabad and the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in December 2007, the BBC said.        
	It is not that Yazid is any great friend of Asif Ali Zardaris Pakistan but the prerogative of attacking the country is exclusively his, it seems.        
	Yazid also calls on the people of Pakistan to rise up and overthrow the government and president, the BBC said. Yazid is said to be in charge of al Qaidas operations in this region and is ranked behind No 2 Ayman al-Zawahiri. Last year he claimed that al Qaida was responsible for the assassination of Mrs (Benazir) Bhutto. Yazid was last heard in August 2008 when he confirmed the death of al Qaida chemical-weapons expert, Midhat Mursi al-Sayid Umar.        
	On December 27, 2007, Yazid is said to have claimed responsibility for Benazirs assassination, telling a magazine: We terminated the most precious American asset which vowed to defeat [the] mujahideen.        
	The magazine revealed that Yazid had said that the assassination had been ordered by Zawahiri.        
	There were suggestions today that Yazid has also sent his video to the Indian authorities but there is no confirmation of these claims.        
	President Barack Obama may have some views of his own on Yazids video.        
	In his first news conference in Washington last night, Obama said his administration would not allow safe havens for militants in Pakistans tribal region bordering Afghanistan.        
	Obama stressed that his envoy to the region, Richard Holbrooke, who has just arrived in the region, would convey his message to Islamabad.        
	My bottom line is that we cannot allow al Qaida to operate, declared the president. We cannot have those safe havens in that region.        
	Obama was more concerned about al Qaida attacks on America but he added: Were going to have to work both smartly and effectively, but with consistency in order to make sure that those safe havens dont exist.        
	Obama emphasised that he had appointed Holbrooke as a special envoy for Pakistan and Afghanistan to give a new focus to dealing with terrorism.        
	Ive sent over Richard Holbrooke  one of our top diplomats  to evaluate a regional approach, he said. We are going to need more effective co-ordination of our military efforts with diplomatic efforts, with development efforts, with more effective co-ordination with our allies.

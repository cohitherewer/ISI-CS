The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | BJP looks to future, with five-year-old thoughts

          SANJAY K JHA                                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 10: The agenda of the BJPs chintan baithak this month is exactly the same as the one that had dominated its last such meeting in 2004, signalling the partys stagnation.        
	The focus of the meeting, to be held from August 20 in Shimla, will be on restoring the primacy of ideology, strengthening the organisation and expanding the partys appeal in the south, east and the Northeast.         
	These issues are hardly different from those that the chintan baithak of August 2004, held after the Vajpayee government was voted out, had focused on and debated.         
	Other issues on the agenda this time are attracting youths, Dalits and minorities, exposing the UPA governments failures, and taking steps to consolidate the BJPs traditional support base. These themes, too, go back to 2004.        
	Although the party has moved forward on one account, by forming its government in Karnataka last year, all other vital concerns remain unchanged after five years.        
	On several fronts, the crisis has become deeper, ostensibly because the leadership worked in violation of the promises made at the 2004 baithak.        
	While the party failed to break fresh ground in Bengal, Orissa, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and the Northeast, fresh doubts about Hindutva as an electoral weapon, and disunity among top leaders, indicated the last brainstorming session was largely a futile exercise.        
	Task Ahead, the discussion paper approved for the 2004 baithak by the national executive, had made it clear that the party should not be defensive or apologetic about projecting its distinctive ideological identity and its relationship with other nationalist organisations (read the RSS, VHP, Bajrang Dal and others).        
	It was decided that the party would mount a powerful counter-offensive against political forces that rejected Hindutva as the basic identity of the Indian nation and perverted the ideal of secularism for their narrow political ends.         
	Ironically, many party ideologues and close associates of L.K. Advani had blamed Hindutva soon after this years Lok Sabha poll defeat, even suggesting the need to distance the party from the RSS.        
	The 2004 document said the party would ensure that positions and responsibilities were given to persons whose primary commitment was to ideology. But Advani rejected this doctrine and ran his campaign through personal loyalists who were not products of the Sangh parivar.        
	The document laid emphasis on the principles of collective responsibility, mutuality and communication. It lamented that there had been some erosion of commitment to these principles, allowing individualism, lack of consultation and co-ordination, and absence of camaraderie to take root.        
	The 2009 campaign vindicated the partys fears. The top leadership was so fragmented that key strategist Arun Jaitley and party president Rajnath Singh were not on talking terms. The 2004 document appeared to have foreseen the problems, talking of self-centred behaviour, indiscipline, lack of mutual trust and lust for power, and stressing the need to guard against these tendencies.        
	The period between 2004 and 2009 witnessed unprecedented internal bickering, conspiracies and mutual distrust among top leaders. This baithak is being held in an atmosphere completely vitiated by factionalism and intrigue.         
	The document criticised the growing culture of indiscipline and said one manifestation of this was the tendency to use the media to air personal grievances.

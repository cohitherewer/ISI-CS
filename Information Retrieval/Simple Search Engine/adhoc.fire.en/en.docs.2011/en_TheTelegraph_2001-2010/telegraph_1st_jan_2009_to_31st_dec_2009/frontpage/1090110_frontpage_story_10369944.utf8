	Ranchi, Jan. 9: So desperate is Shibu Soren to remain chief minister, that he is even considering fighting another election on the trot and secure his place in the state legislature.        
	And lending credence to this desperate measure was suspended BJP MLA from Jamtara Vishnu Bhaiya, who resigned from the state Assembly today, to help Soren try his luck again.        
	Speaker Alamgir Alam has accepted his resignation.         
	In New Delhi, soon after meeting Congress general secretary Ajay Maken, Soren spoke out. I will go (to the) peoples court again. We are trying our best to avert imposition of Presidents rule in Jharkhand. The decision of the UPA high command will be final, said Soren.        
	But, as soon as word spread about his plan, his rivals were quick to rebuke him. JVM (P) chief and Koderma MP Babulal Marandi, who has defeated Soren at the hustings before, said he was ready to walk into Jamtara to teach Soren a lesson. Advising his rival to uphold the dignity of democratic values and step down immediately, he said: He (Soren) should have quit yesterday soon after the Tamar results were out. But, he chose to lobby with UPA leaders in Delhi to somehow save his chair.        
	I have defeated both Shibu Soren and Rupi Soren in Dumka. I am well acquainted with every village of the Jamtara Assembly constituency. I will be forced to teach him a lesson if he does not mend his ways, Marandi told The Telegraph over phone.        
	However, Bhaiyas sacrifice at this juncture is unlikely to benefit Soren, whose exit now looks imminent. The election commission cannot be compelled to hold by-election for the Jamtara seat within two months.        
	According to states chief electoral officer Debashish Gupta, the poll procedure requires less than three weeks time. The Constitution only says that vacancies ought to be filled within six months. There is no minimum time-frame, he said.        
	Bhaiya was elected to the Assembly for the first time in 2005. Marandi, who was then with the BJP used his discretionary powers to grant him a party ticket. Even after Marandi parted ways with the BJP, Bhaiya continued to champion his cause within the party. He was suspended from the party and an anti-defection case was lodged against him after he started hobnobbing with Soren to topple the Madhu Koda government in August, last year. Consequently, the Speaker suspended his voting rights in the Assembly.

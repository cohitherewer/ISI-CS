  - Explosive goes off in firing range          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Dergaon, March 4: A rifle-fired grenade went off and killed a jawan when he was instructing 154 Assam police recruits how to unload the explosive during a training session at Kaliyani firing range near Numaligarh in Golaghat this evening.        
	Five others were also injured in the accident.         
	Around 5pm, when darkness fell on the firing range atop Deopahar under Assam Police Training College, deputy superintendent of police Akhil Chandra Das, in charge of the training session, asked the team to call it a day.         
	The jawans of the 12th Assam Police Battalion, based at Jamuguri in Sonitpur, were in the middle of the grenade training session under lance naik Dilip Barhoi when the pack-up orders came.        
	However, about 10 grenades had already been primed (a technical term used to describe a grenade being fitted to the rifle before firing). When Barhoi was un-priming one of these, it exploded, injuring four jawans, including Barhoi, commandant of the 11th Assam Police Battalion, Abu Sufian, said.         
	Barhoi was rushed to Vivekananda Hospital in Numaligarh Refinery township where he was declared dead on arrival.        
	Havildar Montu Ahmed, constables Kamal Buragohain, Gagan Baishya and Dimbeswar Bora were also injured in the explosion. The commandant said the DSP and a constable were injured when they fell down as recruits began a mad rush away from explosion site. The batch was in the last stages of training and they were camping at the firing range for the past four days for training in heavy weapons, grenade firing and field firing, he said.         
	About 40 recruits were still waiting for the training on grenade firing today when the accident occurred.         
	The recruits, the commandant said, had marched for about 20km to the range on March 1 from the 11th Assam Police Battalion headquarters in Dergaon. The 12th Assam Police Battalion jawans were undergoing training under the 11th Assam Police Battalion.        
	The commandant termed the accident very unfortunate but ruled out any lapses on Barhois part.        
	 Barhoi had been providing training to new recruits for several years now and was a very good hand, he said.

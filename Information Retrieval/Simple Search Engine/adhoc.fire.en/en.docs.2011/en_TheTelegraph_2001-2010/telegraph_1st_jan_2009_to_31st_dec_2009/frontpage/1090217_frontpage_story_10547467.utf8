The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Oops! An IIM one too many
                                                                                                           Oops! An IIM one too many
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 16: An error in the interim budget speech has left the human resource development ministry worried that it may be saddled with the task of fulfilling a promise made inadvertently.         
	Stand-in finance minister Pranab Mukherjee mentioned that an Indian Institute of Management was being set up in Rajasthan under the XIth Five Year Plan.         
	Under the Plan, however, there is no provision for an IIM in Rajasthan.        
	Surprised bureaucrats confirmed that there was no move to set up an IIM in that state. This is an error, but it creates problems for us. The speech may be wrongly interpreted as a promise to Rajasthan, winced an official at the HRD ministry.         
	Mukherjee is not responsible for the mistake  he is expected to read out the text structured from inputs provided by various ministries, a retired bureaucrat said.         
	HRD ministry officials said the error was in all likelihood committed by a member of its team tasked with briefing the finance ministry.         
	If Rajasthan officials or any citizen were to quiz the HRD ministry over the promise, the ministry will find itself in a quandary. We could be accused of going back on a promise, when there never was a conscious assurance. Such a scenario will hardly be desirable ahead of the elections, an official said.         
	Political compulsions may force the government to ask us to start an IIM in Rajasthan as well. We are already overburdened and this could mean a headache for us, a junior official said.         
	Under the XIth Plan, the government has promised IIMs in Meghalaya (Shillong), Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand, Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir.        
	The Shillong IIM started classes last year. Haryana, Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have acquired land for the IIMs and transferred it to the Centre.         
	The HRD ministry is yet to receive approval from the expenditure finance committee (EFC) for starting the six new IIMs other than the one at Shillong. The EFC clearance is mandatory for approaching the cabinet for approval. Only after the cabinet clears the project can the six IIMs be registered as societies.        
	Some officials feel that most or all of the promised IIMs may only come up under the next government.         
	Mukherjee, in his speech today, however, chose to suggest that four of the planned IIMs can start offering classes this year. The idea behind the suggestion, an official explained, is to allow the government to claim, if it does start any of the new IIMs this year, that the institutes were announced before the poll model code kicked in.         
	The chances are that any cabinet clearance will come only after the model code is announced. If we do decide to go ahead with the new IIMs this year, we can claim the move was announced in the budget prior to the code, the official said.         
	The budget documents contain typographical errors, too. The decimal is wrongly placed in several allocations for the ministry of social justice and empowerment listed in the first volume of the expenditure budget. The errors create the false impression that the budget has sharply reduced funds slotted for the ministry.

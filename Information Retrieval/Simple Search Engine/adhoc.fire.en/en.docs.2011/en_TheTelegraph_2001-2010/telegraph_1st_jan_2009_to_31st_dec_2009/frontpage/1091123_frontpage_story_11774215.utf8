  - CM cracks Haldia whip,   Mamata for jute talks        OUR BUREAU                                                      
	Calcutta, Nov. 22: Mamata Banerjee and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today ran an unusual race on different platforms but to settle the same question: who swears by governance more.        
	In the process, both leaders more or less disowned strikes and stressed the need for consensus, and Mamata dropped hints that she could find some room for manoeuvre on issues over which she had taken seemingly inflexible positions earlier.         
	There was no dramatic turnaround but the thrust on matters of governance came at a time Bengal is going through one of its most divisive political phases and most inactive administrative seasons.        
	The strike at Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd (HPL) provided a telling backdrop. Responding to the chief ministers charges earlier in the day at Tamluk that the Opposition was obstructing development, Mamata told STAR Ananda in the evening that her party was against the HPL strike.        
	It was a pointed jab at the chief minister, whose partys labour arm  Citu  is sponsoring the strike, which is being seen as an attempt by toppled CPM strongman Lakshman Seth to gain lost ground. If the captain is bad, so will be the team, Mamata said.        
	Her reference was to the Left Front government but later in the evening, officials of East Midnapore disclosed that the chief minister had told them to ensure that those who wanted to work at HPL were not prevented from doing do by others.         
	The reported directive came on a day striking Citu supporters clashed with members of a Trinamul union who tried to force their way in. But Seth has vowed to resist the administration, saying let there be bloodshed. ( )        
	Spying some space on the high pedestal, Mamata, who has shown that she can match the CPMs willingness and ability to cripple Bengal with bandhs, held forth on the virtues of dialogue.        
	Mamata said she was opposed to strikes and bandhs and that disputes between workers and the management could be resolved through talks, keeping the factories open.        
	She also set up another litmus test for Citu, referring to an indefinite strike the union has called in 54 jute mills across Bengal from December 14 demanding wage dues, PF and gratuity for 2.5 lakh employees.         
	We would like to get over the crisis in jute mills through discussions with the management. Our minister Dinesh Trivedi has been assigned to talk to jute mill owners to consider the demands of the mill workers, she said. Mamata today chaired a meeting of Trinamuls trade union cell at which it was decided to oppose the strike.        
	On divestment  an issue on which Trinamul and the CPM share near-identical views  Mamata appeared to give some leeway to the Manmohan Singh government that wants to shed up to 10 per cent shares in several public sector units.        
	Mamata said that though she was in principle opposed to divestment, the proceeds were necessary to implement welfare schemes like the rural job scheme.        
	The railway minister said the government should float one to two per cent shares and sell those to the employees of the company. But she added that she would say no to divestment in Air India and Ircon (Indian Railways Construction Company).

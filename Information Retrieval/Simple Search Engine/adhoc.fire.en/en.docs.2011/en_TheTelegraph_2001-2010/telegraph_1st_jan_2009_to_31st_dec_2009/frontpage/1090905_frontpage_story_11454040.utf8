                                Neil Armstrong on the surface of the moon on July 20, 1969                            
	Sept. 4: Two Bangladeshi newspapers have apologised after publishing a story taken from the satirical US website The Onion that claimed Neil Armstrongs 1969 Moon landing was faked.        
	The Daily Manab Zamin reported that Armstrong, the first man to set foot on the Moon, had admitted at a news conference that the historic landing was part of an elaborate hoax.        
	Neither they, nor The New Nation, which also ran the story, realised that The Onion, which also prints a parody newspaper, was not a genuine news site.        
	The story, which first ran in the US on Monday, said that Armstrong had been convinced by a conspiracy theorist that the Apollo 11 mission had been orchestrated by the US government.        
	The satirical article claimed Armstrong said: It took only a few hastily written paragraphs published by this passionate denier of mankinds so-called greatest technological achievement for me to realise I had been living a lie.Armstrong continued, in the made-up quote, by explaining that, although the journey had felt real, in fact the entire thing was filmed on a sound stage, most likely in New Mexico.        
	I suppose it really was one small step for man, one giant lie for mankind.        
	The report has drawn a lot of attention. Weve since learned that the fun site runs false and juicy reports based on a historic incident, Daily Manab Zamin, a tabloid newspaper, said in a printed apology.        
	The moon landing one was such story, which received numerous hits on the Internet.        
	The truth is that Neil Armstrong never gave such an interview. It was made up. We are sorry for publishing the report without checking the information. The New Nations associate editor Hasanuzzuman Khan told AFP news agency: We thought it was true so we printed it without checking. We didnt know The Onion was not a real news site.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             Pranab Mukherjee cuts a cake to celebrate Congress president Sonia Gandhis 63rd birthday with Babulal Marandi (left) and Subodh Kant Sahay in Ranchi on Wednesday. Picture by Prashant Mitra                                        
	Ranchi, Dec. 9: Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today declared that investigating agencies would look into all aspects of the corruption case against Madhu Koda, indicating the probe would not bypass any of the senior politicians whose names allegedly figure in the former chief ministers diary.        
	Whatever information has been made available will be worked out by the probe agencies, he told reporters here after addressing election rallies in support of Congress candidates in Singhbhum.        
	Asked specifically about Kodas diary, which according to investigating agencies contained names of several prominent Congress as well as RJD leaders, the Union minister said: All these aspects are being looked into and the culprits will be brought to book.        
	Insisting that the law will take its own course in the investigations of the Enforcement Directorate and the income tax department, Mukherjee clarified that there was no question of giving a long rope to Koda in view of the elections, thereby trying to counter Opposition BJPs claim that the Congresss actions against the former chief minister so far was mere eyewash.        
	The motive of making too much money in too short a period due to unbridled greed is the root cause of corruption, he said when asked about the reasons behind the Koda scam.        
	Mukherjee, however, deftly sidestepped a question on the Congresss choice of chief minister and why it hadnt projected one person as the prospective leader of the state.         
	We project only the Prime Minister, he said, trying to make light of an issue that may turn out to have a serious bearing on the way the partys fortunes play out in the Assembly elections, even as he was flanked by cabinet colleague Subodh Kant Sahay and JVM leader Babulal Marandi  both claimants to the top post in case the alliance secured a majority.        
	Mukherjee promised to fulfil the partys promises made in the election manifesto and spoke on the Congresss ability to provide political stability in Jharkhand.        
	He admitted that price rise was a serious concern and went on to elaborate the reasons behind it, not forgetting that the BJP was successfully using it as a campaign stick to beat the Congress with.        
	There is no denying (that) certain essential commodities are having high prices... but fortunately for the last one-and-a-half weeks, we have been noticing a downward trend. But it will take some more time, Mukherjee said.        
	He added the country was facing a huge shortfall of 4MT of pulses. We have not been able to bridge the gap by import as a very few countries are producing surplus pluses, he pointed out.         
	Mukherjee said the government had allowed private traders to import these commodities without import duty under the open general license scheme, but lamented the collapse of PDS in Jharkhand.         
	When prices are moving upwards, weaker sections of society can be provided food security through the public distribution system. Unfortunately, PDS has collapsed in the state, he said.

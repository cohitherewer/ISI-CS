The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Nitish plays for Bihar monopoly
                                                                                                           Nitish plays for Bihar monopoly
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                   
	New Delhi, May 15: Dont read too much into what I said, but do please read  thats the message Nitish Kumar sent out today.         
	The key thing about the alarm bells the Bihar chief minister triggered in NDA precincts this morning by seeming to open himself to political polygamy was neither the alarm nor the cautionary note he quickly put on it. The key thing was something thats got drowned in the swelling din for power in Delhi  its a bid for sole proprietorship of Bihar, Delhi can wait.         
	Nitish, with his big projected numbers, could well swing this way or that in Delhi, but for him that will merely be collateral consequence; the central theme of his unravelling game plan remains Bihar. Hes done enough, he believes, to make a grab for what Lalu Prasad was for a decade and a half  only and unchallenged king of the realm.         
	Lalu Prasad should worry, and not merely about getting drubbed in the Lok Sabha stakes. What Nitish set in motion this morning by championing the cause of special status for Bihar is a strategy that will unravel over a much longer period. It could well put all his competition out of the market.         
	Because what Nitish Kumar brought to the show this morning was not just his 80-page manifesto for a new Bihar and economist Meghnad Desai to release it; he brought to it the credibility of a man who has gained acceptance with friend and foe alike.        
	Far weightier than endorsements from the likes of Rahul Gandhi will be the pile of ballots Biharis hand him as reward  there was, through the campaign in Bihar, a rare and almost tactile incumbency mood prompted by the positive change the Nitish years have wrought over Lalu raj.         
	The Bihar chief minister may probably be entitled to feel a little pampered once the verdict is out: both sides of his bread appear buttered and he wants to make that reward stick.         
	Should the NDA, his avowed allies as of tonight, be in a position to take Delhi, Nitish will have played a critical role in taking the alliance there; he will demand his named price  special status for Bihar.         
	If the UPA looks like retaining power, Nitish could well switch sides claiming his main interest is the greater interest of Bihar. He will probably lose his government instantly, but he appears quietly prepared. He is on a high, he may well want to ride it now  in the name of Bihar.         
	The Congress is, of course, no natural ally to Nitish. He has been schooled a Lohiaite Socialist, smelted in anti-Congressism. But if he could have the BJP on his shoulders, he must be a man capable of employing more tactical ploys than he has revealed to us.         
	Indeed, this may suit his long-term politics better. The BJP is a compulsion for Nitish, not comfort. He has dominated the alliance in Bihar by sheer dint of persona  wooing Muslims even if the BJP ranks snigger and complain and punishing the guilty of Bhagalpur even if it inflicts local damage on his ally.        
	He knows he can achieve an almost Lalu-like grip on the Muslim vote if he jettisons the BJP. He also senses somewhere that he has made personal roads into the upper caste/urban middle class vote bank of the BJP with his no-nonsense development agenda.         
	The BJP needs him far more today than he needs the BJP. But in the time to come, Nitish will seek to accentuate this imbalance of power in his favour. He would, at some point, want to dismount and run the course alone. But when? Most certainly before the next Assembly elections in Bihar, because Nitish wants less and less to share his plate.         
	If proof were required, he offered it this morning. He wasnt an NDA protagonist espousing Bihars betterment at that book release, he was Nitish Kumar, it wasnt a concert performance, it was a solo act  if Bihar has a spokesperson its me, Nitish Kumar.        
	Todays statements  a craftily timed act in the uncertain zone between the vote and the verdict  were probably the initiation of that new ambition blazing in Bihar. Keep watching.

          GAJINDER SINGH                            SPS Rathore (top), Om Prakash Chautala                          
	Chandigarh, Dec. 25: Ruchika Girhotras family and friends want Sonia Gandhi to intervene for sterner punishment to a former top cop who molested the girl and harassed her family, pushing her to suicide.        
	The Bhupinder Singh Hooda-led Congress government in Haryana has been mum so far  S.P.S. Rathore, the accused in the case, is a former Haryana director-general of police  which has further made Subhash Girhotra as well as the parents of witness Aradhana Prakash feel that only the Congress president can get them justice.        
	Ruchikas father Subhash Girhotra is in New Delhi. We are going to Hoodas residence tomorrow with CPM leader Brinda Karat to plead for justice. The Haryana governments silence on the matter is worrying, said Anand Prakash, Aradhanas father.        
	We will be knocking on everyones doors in New Delhi for justice. We are pained at the quantum of sentence for Rathore and hope Sonia intervenes and delivers justice like she reportedly did in the Jessica Lal case, he said.         
	A Haryana Congress leader said Sonia intervened to make Venod Sharma quit the Haryana state cabinet after a sting operation showed him bribing witnesses to save his son Manu from being convicted in the Jessica Lal murder case.        
	Former Haryana chief minister and Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) leader Om Prakash Chautala, whom Subhash has blamed for his daughters suicide, today iterated that he had not promoted Rathore as police chief of the state and the case file was never placed before him when he was chief minister for 15 days.        
	The INLD also released a date-wise chronology of the events that followed in the Ruchika case, absolving itself from all blame.        
	The Union home ministry is considering stripping Rathore of his police medal and slashing his pension, sources said. The ministry may showcause him, reports PTI.        
	The sources said the ministry may advise the Haryana government to start an internal probe to find out who helped Rathore scuttle the judicial process.        
	Law minister Veerappa Moily said the 19-year delay was unpardonable. The minister said he had discussed the case with the CBI and the solicitor-general but did not say if it would be reopened.

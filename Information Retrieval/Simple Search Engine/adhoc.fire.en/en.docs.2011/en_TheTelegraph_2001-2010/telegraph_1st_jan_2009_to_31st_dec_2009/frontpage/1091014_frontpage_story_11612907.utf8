	New Delhi, Oct. 13 (PTI): Nobel laureate Venkatraman Ramakrishnan has expressed disenchantment with people from India bothering him and clogging his email inbox and dubbed as strange their sudden urge to reach out to him.        
	All sorts of people from India have been writing to me, clogging up my email inbox. It takes me an hour or two to just remove their mails, he said. He said the deluge of emails had buried important communications from colleagues or from journals.        
	Do these people have no consideration? It is OK to take pride in the event, but why bother me? the scientist wondered in an email interview. There are also people who have never bothered to be in touch with me for decades who suddenly feel the urge to connect, said Ramakrishnan, who shared the Nobel for chemistry with two others.        
	He expressed anguish over all sorts of lies published about him. People I dont know, for example a Mr Govindrajan, claim that they were my teachers at Annamalai University which I never attended since I left Chidambaram at the age of three.

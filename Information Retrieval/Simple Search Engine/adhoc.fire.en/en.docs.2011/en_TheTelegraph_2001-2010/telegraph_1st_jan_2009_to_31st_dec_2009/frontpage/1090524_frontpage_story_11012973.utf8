          MIKE HARVEY                            Natalie Cole: Direct donation                                  
	San Francisco, May 23: The soul singer Natalie Cole is recovering in hospital after her appeal for a kidney donor was answered by a dying fan.        
	The 59-year-old star talked about the queue for a life-saving organ transplant in a television chat show appearance. There are nearly 80,000 people on kidney transplant waiting lists in the US.        
	The daughter of Nat King Cole has suffered ill health since she had hepatitis C diagnosed in early 2008  a condition she attributed to her past drug addiction  which affected her liver. She also suffered severe kidney problems and has been on a dialysis machine three times a week since last September.        
	She made an appearance on the Larry King Live show in March, saying that both her kidneys had failed and how she desperately needed a kidney transplant. Im on a very long list, which is why we are looking to donors, she said. She was immediately overwhelmed by emails from viewers offering their own kidneys.        
	On Tuesday she went into hospital in Los Angeles when news came through that she had been given a direct donation by a dying 22-year-old. OneLegacy, the charitable agency in Los Angeles that facilitated the match, said that it was rare for donors to specify who should get their kidneys.

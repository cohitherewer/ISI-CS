          A STAFF REPORTER                                          
	Calcutta, Dec. 12: The city witnessed its first major fog-related disruption of the season this morning, with delayed or cancelled flights and trains leaving thousands of passengers stranded for hours.        
	Twenty-five aircraft taking off from Calcutta airport were delayed by three to four hours on an average and three were cancelled. Two incoming flights were diverted to other cities. Several long-distance trains arrived late in Howrah and suburban trains too were hit late last night and early this morning.        
	Airport officials said takeoffs and landings stopped completely between 5.30am and 8.50, and the chain reaction caused delays through the day. No takeoffs or landings were scheduled between 2am and 5.30.        
	The Met offices airport bureau said visibility began dropping early in the morning as fog enveloped the runway, falling to 50 metres around 5.30. Visibility improved to 400 metres around 8.45.        
	The category-II instrumental landing system (ILS), installed last year, can help flights operate only if visibility is 350 metres or above.        
	Emirates flight from Dubai was the first to land, at 8.50, after hovering for nearly an hour. IndiGos Delhi flight was the first to take off, at 9.20.         
	Three flights  JetLites to Dibrugarh, Air Indias to Imphal and Kingfishers to Bagdogra  were cancelled. Air Indias special Haj flight from Jeddah could not land at 8am, was diverted to Mumbai, and returned in the afternoon.         
	Met officials said moisture from the Bay of Bengal had caused the fog in and around Calcutta. It is also preventing the temperature from dropping below normal, an official said.        
	Businessman Lekhraj Kumar was flying Kingfisher to Mumbai. The flight was to take off at 9.15am but moved out of the parking bay at 10.15. It stood on the taxiway for nearly another hour, Kumar said.        
	The delays continued because of runway congestion, an airport official said.        
	Dense fog in north India and the city delayed train arrivals in Howrah.         
	The Lal Quila Express, Sipra Express, Poorvanchal Express, Amritsar Mail, Danapur Express and the Doon Express were all delayed by two-and-a-half to three hours. Suburban trains were delayed by an average of 30 minutes between 1am and 9.50am.

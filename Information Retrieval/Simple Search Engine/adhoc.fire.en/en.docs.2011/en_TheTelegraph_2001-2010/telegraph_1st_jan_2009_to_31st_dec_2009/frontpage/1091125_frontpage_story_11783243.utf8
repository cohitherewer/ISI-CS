	London, Nov. 24: Security experts have identified a new worm which is re-directing iPhone users from a legitimate banking website to a fake one potentially run by cybercriminals.        
	The worm has been identified by security experts at F-Secure (www.f-secure.com), and appears to be predominantly affecting Dutch iPhone users attempting to log on to their ING bank accounts on the device.        
	Users visiting the legitimate home page of the bank are unwittingly redirected to an imitation site by the worm, leaving them vulnerable to cybercriminals, who could capture their username and password and use this information to commit fraud.        
	Only jailbroken iPhones  a hack that allows the device to run software and services not approved by Apple  are affected by the worm.        
	For example, Apple prevents users from switching service providers to unauthorised carriers and limits users to the approximately 100,000 programmes that the company has vetted for installation on the device.         
	The vast majority of customers do not jailbreak their iPhones, and for good reason. These hacks not only violate the warranty, they will also cause the iPhone to become unstable and not work reliably, said Apple spokeswoman Natalie Harrison.        
	Security experts at F-Secure warned that the worm could effectively turn infected iPhones into a botnet, a network of compromised computers at the mercy of hackers or cybercriminals that can be accessed and controlled without the permission of the user.         
	The worm can be transferred from one jailbroken iPhone to another if they are using the same wireless internet connection or hot spot.        
	The discovery of the latest worm comes just weeks after the first ever iPhone worm was discovered.         
	That worm, written by Ashley Towns, rickrolled the iPhones owner by changing the phones wallpaper to show a picture of pop singer Rick Astley and displaying the message ikee is never going to give you up. Mikko Hypponen, a research director at F-Secure, said the newest worm was the first malicious virus for the iPhone. Theres a clear financial motive behind it, he told the BBC.

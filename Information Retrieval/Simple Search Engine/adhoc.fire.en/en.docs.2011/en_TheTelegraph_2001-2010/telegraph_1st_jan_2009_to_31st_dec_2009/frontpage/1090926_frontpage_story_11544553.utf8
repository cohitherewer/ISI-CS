The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Campaign snub to Varun
                                                                                                           Campaign snub to Varun
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Varun: Role reversal                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 25: A star five years ago, almost shunned this time.        
	Maharashtra BJP leaders have conveyed to their Delhi bosses to keep Varun Gandhi off the campaign, fearing his presence may cause Muslims and other minorities to back the ruling Congress-NCP.        
	The move marks a reversal from 2004, when Varun was a star campaigner in the state polls, having addressed nearly as many rallies as top state leaders, the late Pramod Mahajan and Gopinath Munde.        
	Ironically, then his campaign  which helped him make his presence felt on the national scene  theme was how the Congress-NCP government had short-changed Muslims. Shortly thereafter, he was inducted into the BJPs national executive.        
	Officially, BJP spokesperson Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi maintained that Varun would join the road shows if asked to. But party sources stressed he was unwanted.        
	One hint Varun will be here and we will find the CDs of his infamous Pilibhit speech against Muslims all over, a source said, adding his presence could queer the pitch in the battle against the ruling combine.        
	Muslims, the source claimed, are rather disenchanted with the Congress-NCP government as it has done nothing on the Srikrishna Commission report on the 1993 riots, adding not a single accused has been convicted. Another sore point is 26/11. Muslims feels innocent boys were rounded up in the name of terrorism, the source said. They will not vote us (BJP) but if they are indifferent, we stand to gain, he added.        
	Narendra Modi, also known for his hardline views on minority matters, is wanted, especially after his success in the recent by-elections. But the state BJP unit wants him to move only in the Gujarati-speaking areas of Mumbai and other cities, said sources. Also the state leaders have let it be known that he should only stick to development and governance issues and not say a word of minority-related matters.

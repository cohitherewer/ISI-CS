	Ranchi, Jan. 23: Three retired bureaucrats were appointed advisers to Governor Syed Sibtey Razi today, indicating Presidents rule may continue longer than it was expected.        
	In a late evening communiqu to Raj Bhavan, the Union home ministry said G. Krishnan, Sunila Basant and T.P. Sinha were appointed advisers, and their appointment would be effective when they assume charge.        
	Razi, who returned today after his two-day stay in New Delhi, is also reported to have sounded the Congress-led UPA government at the Centre that formation of a popular government in Jharkhand is difficult under the present political situation. He hosted a dinner today in honour of the members of parliamentary committee on wakf.        
	Jharkhand was put under Presidents rule on January 19 with the Assembly being kept in suspended animation.        
	Two of the advisers are retired IAS officers from the state  Krishnan and Basant. Krishnan is a former chief secretary, while Sunila retired as secretary in the Union drinking water and sanitation ministry.         
	Krishnan and Sunila are 1967 and 1970-batch IAS officers, respectively. Sinha, a 1966-batch IPS officer, was the first director-general of police of Jharkhand.        
	The appointment of the advisers has confirmed that the UPA high command is not in a hurry to end Presidents rule. They are more or less reconciled that the formation of government is now a remote possibility with Shibu Soren remaining firm on his nominee to lead the cabinet in Jharkhand.        
	Railway minister Lalu Prasad, a kingmaker in Jharkhand, has also ruled out the possibility of installation of a government in the near future.         
	Right now, there is Presidents rule in Jharkhand and nobody is in a position to form a government, he said in Patna yesterday and reiterated it in Gomoh today.        
	Krishnan, who had succeeded V.S. Dubey as chief secretary during the Babulal Marandi regime, retired in 2003. After his retirement, Krishnan was appointed the chairperson of the state finance commission and, subsequently, the state election commissioner for three years.         
	Basant, after retirement, was appointed special rapporteur in National Human Rights Commission. The Madhu Koda government had recommended her name as the states chief information commissioner.        
	Sinhas appointment has come as a surprise, as he was not supposed to be in the good book of the RJD. Sinha had sent a letter in 2001 to then chief minister Babulal Marandi, accusing the RJD-led Bihar government of using police for harassing his Patna-based family soon after Lalu Prasad was remanded in jail in Ranchi in the fodder scam. At present, he is the chairperson of the Deoghar temple management committee, constituted by Jharkhand High Court.

  - Revolver, laptops in seizure list        RUDRA BISWAS                       Policemen guard the residence of former minister Kamlesh Singh during the vigilance raid in Ranchi on Friday. Picture by Prashant Mitra                                
	Ranchi, July 24: Gold, silver, a revolver and laptops  these and much more were recovered from the residences of former chief minister and Singhbhum MP Madhu Koda and three of his former cabinet colleagues in raids conducted across the state by the vigilance department probing disproportionate assets cases against all.        
	The raids began simultaneously at nine locations since early morning after separate teams were constituted by the state vigilance department with district and women police officers joining in search operations at official residences of Koda, former human resource minister Bandhu Tirkey, former health minister Bhanu Pratap Shahi and former water resources minister Kamlesh Singh at Ranchi, Daltonganj, Bhavanathpur in Garhwa and Chaibasa.        
	The state vigilance department had lodged FIRs against Koda and three others on July 2 for possessing assets disproportionate to their known sources of income.        
	All four have been charged under the Prevention of Corruption Act as well as under various provisions of Indian Penal Code relating to cheating, criminal conspiracy and criminal breach of trust.        
	The exact worth of todays seizures, vigilance officials said, would be assessed only after careful scrutiny of all the items and documents.        
	At Kodas Ranchi residence, vigilance sources claimed, several kilograms of gold and silver ornaments along with several laptops were recovered. Gold was also seized from Shahis Bhavanathpur residence in Garhwa.        
	At Tirkeys residence at Banhora in Ranchi, vigilance officials were taken aback to find a revolver along with several rounds of ammunition. This apart, six mobile phones were also seized from his residence that is opposite the Ranchi deputy commissioners house.         
	But, no sooner had officials zeroed in on the revolver, than Tirkey rushed to the vigilance headquarters at Audrey House to claim that he was being framed by vested interests.         
	There, he claimed that a country-made single shot revolver was found at his home.        
	Earlier in the day, when a vigilance team was on way to search Kodas house at Chaibasa in Singhbhum they ran into a wrong address. Director-general of police (vigilance) Neyaz Ahmad later explained that a wrong address was given in the FIR filed against the former chief minister that led to the confusion.                          
	The official address of the former chief minister at his native village in Chaibasa is different from what has been stated in the FIR. We shall approach the court once again for orders to search Kodas residence at his native village, he said.        
	Ahmad confirmed todays raids threw up a credit cards, laptops, and a revolver. Also, a number of documents detailing investments of the former ministers had been seized.        
	 Our teams have not yet returned. The revolver seized from Bandhu Tirkeys residence is subject to examination before we can come up with details. We can give details once all the evidences seized are examined, he said, refusing to give further details.        
	The DG also appealed to citizens to co-operate with the vigilance department and pass on any information people may have relating to the assets of the four former ministers.        
	 On July 2, the vigilance court ordered filing of FIRs against Koda, Tirkey, Shahi and Kamlesh Singh after taking cognisance of a complaint filed by one Rajiv Sharma, a resident of Ashoknagar in Ranchi.        
	Sharma had alleged that the former chief minister and three of his cabinet colleagues had amassed huge wealth illegally and by misusing their official positions.         
	He alleged that Koda, through his close associate, Vinod Sinha, and others had siphoned off huge sums of money which were used to launch more than a dozen manufacturing and trading companies in various parts of India and Dubai .         
	Kamlesh Singh, he claimed, spent crores in the marriage of his two daughters, besides buying assets worth Rs 50 crore in the names of his wife and daughters.         
	As for Tirkey, Sharma alleged he had used his official position as minister to grant favours to a construction company to get a flat worth Rs 8 crore in Delhi, besides buying hundred acre land at Banhoura in Ranchi .         
	Shahi, he alleged, had bought 30 acre land at several places near Ranchi .         
	Surprisingly, the state Congress came out in defence of the ex-ministers and described the raids as politically motivated. PCC chief Pradeep Balmuchu said, The raids prove that government officials are now unbridled and are virtually out of control.         
	At a hurriedly convened press conference along with former deputy chief minister Stephen Marandi, he said the raids were unwarranted when the ex-ministers were co-operating with the vigilance bureau.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Death sets stage for play on Dubai plight 
                                                                                                           Death sets stage for play on Dubai plight 
          BASANT RAWAT                            Mallika Sarabhai                                  
	Ahmedabad, Oct. 14: The young man had just got married but left his wife back home in Bengal. Dubai was far away, but the salary of Rs 40,000 was too good to refuse.        
	A few months later, he was dead. He had hanged himself.        
	He had tried but couldnt convince his family that all that he was getting was Rs 8,000, not the money the agents and touts had promised him before he left.        
	The young Bengalis tale mirrors the despair of many of the 1.5 lakh labourers from India who live in concrete barracks in Dubai, sometimes six to eight in a room, taking turns at cooking.        
	Many of them break down, unable to take the stress and loneliness of separation, says dancer Mallika Sarabhai, who has just returned from a visit to some of these labour settlements and has been invited to stage a play in Dubai next month.        
	The workers are extremely unhappy and frustrated as they feel lonely in the concrete barracks where six to eight people share a room and cook food for themselves, she says.        
	They see their families every three years unless they want to break their contract. But its hard to raise money to pay for a trip home.        
	Mallikas play, which her group is rehearsing, is about the plight of these labourers  most of them from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat  who work for big construction firms in the Gulf sheikhdom, a dream destination for many of Indias poor.        
	A counsellor told her about the Bengali youth who hanged himself from a ceiling fan a day after he had requested his supervisor to talk to his family back home and tell them that he wasnt lying.        
	The young man wasnt the only one who felt cheated of his due. When a first-time job seeker lands in Dubai, he is told by company officials that for six months he will get only his basic salary, which comes to around Rs 8,000.        
	Many of them suffer from stress and depression. Sometimes they break down and even become violent. Reason: they hardly open up and socialise. They dont make friends, says Mallika.        
	The only time they get to socialise is when they are taken to a mall every Thursday evening and during occasional visits to dance bars where they splurge their hard-earned money.        
	Back in their cramped barracks, loneliness takes over again.        
	But through our play, which our group is rehearsing, we are going to tell the workers that it is OK to feel lonely, it is not a sign of weakness. Whatever the situation we are in, we can face it. Life is bigger than our problems, anxieties and situation. Alcoholism definitely is not an answer to loneliness, Mallika says, talking about the theme of her yet-to-be-named play, a request from Indias consul general in Dubai Venu Rajamony, who had seen some of Mallikas stage performances.        
	Concerned about the condition of Indian workers, Rajamony had invited Mallika to stage a play on their lives  but with a message of hope.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Stop immersion in rivers: PIL
                                                                                                           Stop immersion in rivers: PIL
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                            A Durga idol being immersed in Calcutta                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 9: A public interest litigation filed in the Supreme Court today called for an immediate halt to immersion of idols in natural water bodies.        
	However, a bench headed by the Chief Justice said it would hear the PIL in the due course, ignoring activist and trader Salek Chand Jains plea for an urgent hearing.        
	The PIL, filed by activist lawyer Sugreev Dubey on behalf of Jain, said immersion in rivers and ponds after festivals like Durga Puja and Saraswati Puja contaminate the water with harmful chemicals and other non-biodegradable substances that go into making the idols.        
	It suggested that idols be buried after festivals in specially created ponds and bunds constructed near natural water bodies, and urged the court to step in and protect the countrys dying rivers and ponds.         
	The PIL also drew the courts attention to recent large-scale immersions that played havoc with potable water supply in several parts of Delhi after the pujas. It added that the quantity of offerings dumped in the Yamuna was so much that several canals were blocked.        
	The PIL said the right to practise, profess and propagate any religion was the fundamental right of every citizen, but it does not give anybody the untrammelled right to pollute rivers with idols.

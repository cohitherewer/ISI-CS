                                                                                                           Kasab lawyer seeks time for rethink
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Kasab (top); Waghmare                                 
	Mumbai, March 31: Lawyer Anjali Waghmare today sought a day to decide whether she would stick to her decision to represent Mumbai attack gunman Ajmal Kasab.        
	Her request to the special court, which had appointed her to defend the only Pakistani caught alive during last Novembers strike, came a day after reports said she had given the Shiv Sena a letter saying she would withdraw.        
	Today, she didnt mention the letter, only saying she was under lot of pressure after hundreds of Shiv Sena activists laid siege to her home and shouted slogans late last night.        
	The 40-year-old, looking shaken, alleged before judge M.L. Tahilyani this afternoon that some people in the mob were drunk and had used filthy language. The protesters had asked her how she could agree to represent Kasab despite being a policemans wife. How can the mob decide whether the trial will go on or not? asked Waghmare. The trial in the case is to begin on April 6.         
	She also pointed a finger at the media. The media said I have taken up the case voluntarily. Why has the media not gone to Uddhav Thackeray (Shiv Sena executive president) over the attack? said Waghmare, who was chosen from the state legal aid cell only yesterday.        
	When Tahilyani tried to calm her down, she snapped. I am under a lot of pressure. Please give me a day to decide and think about it. The judge agreed and asked Waghmares co-lawyer K.P. Pawar to tell the court tomorrow whether he would continue with the case.         
	Tahilyani sought a police report on the protests outside Waghmares house in the Worli police staff quarters, where she lives with her husband, assistant police inspector Ramesh Waghmare, and their teenage daughter.        
	The judge said he would decide whether to launch contempt proceedings against the nine persons who have been arrested for the siege. Among those held is Shiv Senas Worli leader Madhukar Dalvi. All those held have been booked on charges of unlawful assembly and trespass.        
	The activists of the Sena, which has been demanding that Kasab be hanged in public, had dispersed only after Waghmare reportedly gave their party a written undertaking saying she would withdraw from the case. I respect the sentiments of people and will withdraw from the case. I am sorry, the letter purportedly written by her says.        
	Some of Waghmares neighbours seemed unhappy that she had agreed to be Kasabs lawyer. As a policemans wife, we expected her to understand how we feel. We were shocked to hear she has taken up the case, said one of them.        
	Earlier in the day, Waghmare met joint police commissioner (crime) Rakesh Maria, who promised her security as long as the trial went on. Policemen have already been posted at her house after last nights protests.        
	Lawyers expressed shock at the threats, given that three advocates had pulled out earlier after initially agreeing to represent Kasab. Sudeep Pasbola, president of the Bar Association of City Civil and Sessions Court, said protests like the one last night would only jeopardise a fair trial. If this continues, he (Kasab) could be taken out of Maharashtra. Waghmare has not taken up the case on her own. She has been appointed by the court.        
	Criminal lawyer Majeed Memon dubbed the incidents distressing. (When previous incidents happened) Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut had said the party was opposing advocates voluntarily taking up Kasabs case and that they will not obstruct a lawyer named by the court. In spite of this, the incident happened.        
	Sena leaders, including Raut, werent available for comment.

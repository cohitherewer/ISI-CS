                                                                                                           Restful battle for Jaswant
  - Desert to Darjeeling, coolest month for guest candidate          ASHIS CHAKRABARTI IN DARJEELING                            Jaswant Singh playing golf in Kalimpong                                        
	An hour of golf in the picturesque army cantonment course in Kalimpong. An occasional game of chess in the lounge of his quaint, nice hotel in Darjeeling. And, early morning walks in the cool mountain air with breathtaking views of Mount Kanchenjungha on a cloudless day.        
	For Jaswant Singh, Indias former defence and external affairs minister, and a veteran of 11 Lok Sabha contests, an election battle has never been so restful. This April has been the coolest month for him in a very long time.        
	Its been such a change of scene from the scorching desert of Jaisalmer where he was campaigning for son Manavendra until a few weeks ago.        
	Advaniji called on the phone on March 30 in the middle of my campaign in the desert and said the party wanted me to contest Darjeeling, he says, sitting under the wooden portico in his hotel compound.        
	So from the blazing desert to cool Darjeeling in the Himalayas he came to contest the polls as the BJP candidate supported by the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, the reigning political force that banished Subash Ghisingh both from local politics and from the hills.         
	As is known, the dethroned king of the queen of the hills now lives in exile in hot and dusty Siliguri at the foot of the mountains.        
	Its been nearly 46 years since Singh was last in Darjeeling as a commissioned officer in the tank division that was based at Hasimara in the foothills.         
	I decided to come for two reasons. First, I love the Gurkhas. Second, here was an opportunity for me to travel an untrodden path. Remember that Robert Frost poem?         
	Singh goes on to quote a well-known Hindi poem which, he says, is popular in his native Rajasthan and in parts of Uttar Pradesh. Leekey leeke gaadi chaley, leekey chaley kapud; leekunhe chhorey teeno chaley, singh shayer sapud. And he translates it into English, Carts move on beaten tracks, so do the unenterprising; three kinds move off the trodden path  the lion, the poet and the enterprising.        
	He laughs at the phonetic similarity between his surname and the Hindi word for lion.        
	But the Gurkhas plight is no laughing matter. They do so much for our country, even giving their lives. And see how they live here.        
	Of course, Singh blames the Bengal government for Darjeelings decline  look at the pathetic state of the roads, the rapacity of the water mafia that exploits the water scarcity here, the reckless multiplying of cars, the plastic everywhere  but he thinks we all are guilty.         
	As we speak, microphones blare from Chowbazar below to announce the first CPM meeting in the hills in more than a year. See how CPM is destroying the peace of Darjeeling.        
	The solution lies in giving them Gorkhaland, he says as he resumes the conversation inside the hotel lounge where we move to make it sound-proof against the CPMs offensive.        
	He doesnt quite understand why Bengalis, who have such intellectual abilities and a wonderful cultural tradition, should be so obsessed with a territorial claim over the Darjeeling hills.        
	After an hour and a half with Singh, I walk down to the CPM meeting, where Sitaram Yechury explains to a small group of party supporters gathered from other areas and knots of curious onlookers that these elections are not about Darjeeling or even Bengal but about forming the next government in New Delhi.        
	A member of the Rajya Sabha, Yechury says he knows Singh, the BJPs leader in the House, well. He may be a heavyweight in Delhi and Rajasthan. But Darjeeling is at a higher altitude and science tells us that even a heavyweight becomes a lightweight at higher altitudes because of the law of gravitation, he quips.        
	He then reads out from the statement of the Bengal unit of the BJP, which opposes the Gorkhaland demand. You decide whom to believe  Jaswantji or his party in Bengal, he tells the small gathering.        
	From the CPM meeting, I trudge down to what was once the partys district committee office and has been the central office of the Communist Party of Revolutionary Marxists (CPRM), which was formed by rebel party leaders who revolted against the CPMs opposition to Gorkhaland.        
	Isnt it the ultimate irony that this revolutionary Marxist party is supporting the BJP candidate in these polls? No, quite the contrary, CPRM leader and once CPMs Rajya Sabha member, R.B. Rai, argues, its the Marxists who always believe in the dynamics of change. CPM now is more conservative than even the BJP.         
	But Rai, an old warhorse in the hills, says something several other local politicians, including Madan Tamang, the charismatic president of the Akhil Bharatiya Gorkha League, and old Ghisingh loyalists, had also told me.         
	I ask Rai if it is yesterday once more in a Darjeeling poll. For 20 years, Darjeeling voted as Ghisingh wanted it to vote. Will it be the same this time  itll be as the Morcha wants it.        
	Its different this time, Rai answers. There are many imponderables  changing moods of the people, the hidden agenda of the GNLF following Ghisinghs poll boycott call and the presence of his followers who have a score to settle with the Morcha, its electoral inexperience and, as Tamang puts it, the organisational weakness of the Morcha compared with that of the GNLF in the latters heyday.        
	Theres the last elections result which shows that, despite Ghisinghs support to Congress candidate Dawa Narbula in 2004, the CPM still managed to get nearly 40,000 votes in the three hill Assembly segments of Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Kurseong. Overall, the party polled 2,95,000 votes and lost to the Congress by 1 lakh votes.        
	This should tell the Morcha leaders that their writ may not run in all corners of the mountains. But then, the GNLFs best days were nearing their end, while the Morcha now is a fresh force, although made of old GNLF leaders and supporters.        
	It certainly will not, Narbula tells me later in the evening when I arrive at his home down a narrow, unlit and steep mountain path, made slippery by a brief spell of rain.        
	He banks on two factors  one, he is the lone local candidate (Jaswantji is twice removed from the people  first as a Rajasthani, then as a raja  and the CPM candidate hails from Cooch Behar); and two, there is a resurgence of support for the Trinamul-Congress even in north Bengal (four Assembly segments in the Darjeeling constituency  Siliguri, Matigara-Naxalbari, Chopra and Phansidewa  are in the plains).        
	Even the Congress supports smaller states, he tells me, almost as an add-on, which betrays his uncertainty about his partys position.        
	If the two factors together help Narbula, that will also mean cutting into the Morchas votes in the hills and the CPMs votes in the plains. And, that confirms Rais  and others  argument that the outcome of the Darjeeling poll this time, unlike in the last 20 years, is somewhat misty like the weather in the mountains now.        
	The Morchas general secretary, Roshan Giri, sees no mist or cloud on Jaswant Singhs poll prospects. The Morcha is the voice of Gorkhaland and Jaswantji will lend his  and his partys  voice to the peoples voice, he exudes confidence.         
	One question, though, seems to be on everyones mind here. Most politicians here agree that the NDA is unlikely to form the next government in Delhi. So what happens to the Gorkhaland demand even if Jaswant Singh wins?

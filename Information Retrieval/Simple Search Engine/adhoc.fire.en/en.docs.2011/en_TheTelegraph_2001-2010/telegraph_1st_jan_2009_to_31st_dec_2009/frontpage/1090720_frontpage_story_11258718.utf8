          ANANYA SENGUPTA                            A jawan outside Hillarys Delhi hotel. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, July 19: Below the radar of policy wonks scanning the horizon for even a minute shift in Indo-US ties, a strategic relationship has changed without much fanfare.        
	Hillary Clinton is staying in the capital at Taj Palace Hotel, not at ITC Maurya that had hosted her husband Bill Clinton and daughter Chelsea during the charm-charged visit in 2000 when the then US First Lady could not accompany her family.        
	For some years, the Maurya had been a favourite of the Americans: it also hosted Bill Clintons successor George W. Bush in 2006 and Hillarys one-time predecessor in the state department, Colin Powell.        
	This time, the pendulum has swung towards the Taj. The hotels are situated adjacent to each other in the diplomatic enclave in central Delhi  so location could not have been much of a deciding factor.        
	The card rate  the actual tariff could be lower  for the most expensive suite at the Maurya is Rs 2,90,000 a night, while the Tajs top slot goes for Rs 1 lakh, according to their official websites. American-baiters may not miss the opportunity to draw attention to the recession and cite the change of hotels as an instance of the superpowers newfound austerity.        
	Officials from both hotels declined comment. But a source pointed out that Hillary had started out in Mumbai by staying at the Taj to express solidarity with the victims of the 26/11 terror strikes and she may have wanted to stay on the same course in Delhi, too.        
	Hillary enjoys a good rapport with Ratan Tata, whose Indian Hotels runs the Taj group of hotels. The two had interacted closely when Hillary was New York Senator and Tata headed the Indo-US CEO Forum. The head of the Tata corporate office in the US, David Good, has also had a long association with the American foreign service.        
	But alls not lost for the Maurya. Hillary today turned up at the Bukhara, a restaurant at the Maurya, for dinner and sat at the same table (No. 64) made famous by her husband.        
	Bukhara was so taken in by the charm of the then most powerful man in the world that its menu has a Presidential Platter named in Bill Clintons honour and a Chelsea Platter.         
	Hillary did not let Bill down tonight, opting for the Presidential Platter: dal Bukhara, paneer tikka, murgh malai kebab, sikandari rann, seekh kebab and mixed raita. For dessert, she chose kulfi and ras malai.        
	Asked whether a platter would be named after Hillary, too, a hotel employee refused to comment. But he added: Its a pity she isnt staying here. But the table is always ready for her.        
	One occupant at the Maurya may have stoked Hillarys interest. Foreign minister S.M. Krishna, whose official bungalow has been allocated but is not yet ready, has been mostly staying at an apartment in the Maurya complex. Hillary is scheduled to meet Krishna tomorrow.

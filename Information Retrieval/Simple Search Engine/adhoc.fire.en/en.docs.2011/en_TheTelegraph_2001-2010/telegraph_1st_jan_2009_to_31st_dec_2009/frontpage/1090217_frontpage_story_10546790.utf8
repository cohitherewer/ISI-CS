The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | IIM plans stuck over land row
                                                                                                           IIM plans stuck over land row

	Ranchi, Feb. 16: Jharkhand hasnt yet been able to convince the Centre about the site it has chosen to set up an Indian institute of management and hence Pranab Mukherjees announcement today that classes would begin in four of the six proposed IIMs in 2009-2010 doesnt hold good for the politically volatile state now under Presidents rule.        
	The site, identified by the state government at Nagri beside the Birsa Agriculture University, 20km from here, is mired in controversy. The 202-acre government plot had been acquired in the 60s and was lying unused. But now that theres talk of an institute coming up there, local residents began voicing their protest.        
	Today, during the presentation of the UPA governments vote-on-account in the Lok Sabha, Mukherjee, while speaking on higher education, said: Teaching is expected to commence in four of the six new IIMs, proposed for the 11th Plan period, from the academic year 2009-10. These are in Haryana, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Tamil Nadu.         
	But that looks uncertain now. A selection committee of the Union human resource development ministry, which visited the area in December 2008, had found local villagers to be vehemently opposed to a takeover  a scenario mega investors waiting to set up steel and power plants in Jharkhand are all too familiar with.         
	The team had also visited a 200-acre of site in Dhanbad near Dhangi village.         
	Upset at the apparent casual approach of the state government, the ministry has shot off a letter to chief secretary A.K. Basu to get immediate possession of the land or identify some other piece of land for the proposed IIM.         
	In fact, a high-level team headed by Amit Khare, joint secretary in the ministry, was supposed to visit Ranchi after February 10 to finalise sites for the proposed IIM as well as a central university. Now, it has deferred plans till such time the state is able to identify land that will ensure the educational projects arent dogged by controversy from start.         
	The government had shorlisted a 300-acre site in Khunti district, 18km from the state capital, for the proposed central university .         
	According to sources, committee members had suggested to state officials to consider the feasibility of handing over land located in Hotwar where Khel Gaon was being constructed for the National Games.         
	Higher education director Anjani Kumar Srivastava, however, said that the states request had not been turned down. I am not aware if the Centre has asked for alternative arrangements for the proposed IIM, he said.         
	The Centre would appoint a director who will make an ad-hoc arrangement for beginning courses. Earlier, there was a proposal to begin classes temporarily in the administrative building of the National Games. But I think the building will not be available till July, Srivastava said.         
	In fact, Union human resources development minister Arjun Singh was keen on opening the 15 central universities before the elections. Singh is also understood to have ordered his ministry to finalise sites for all the new universities by February. But, Jharkhand seems to have put the brakes on his plan.

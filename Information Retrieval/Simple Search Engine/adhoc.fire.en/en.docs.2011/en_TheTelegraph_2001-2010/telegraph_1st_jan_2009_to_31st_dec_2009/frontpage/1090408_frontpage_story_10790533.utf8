The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Durga in Delhi, keeps Cong, JMM guessing
                                                                                                           Durga in Delhi, keeps Cong, JMM guessing

	Ranchi/Dumka, April 7: Durga Soren today kept the Congress and JMM on tenterhooks by not withdrawing from the Godda fray, but abruptly leaving for New Delhi where his father Shibu Soren has been hospitalised.        
	While senior JMM leader Hemlal Murmu claimed Durga had gone to Delhi to discuss his pullout, speculation was rife within the Congress, too, about Soren Juniors real intentions since he now had time only till 3pm tomorrow to formally withdraw his candidature.         
	On the last date of filing nominations on April 4, Durga stunned his party by filing papers to contest the Godda Lok Sabha seat, violating the JMMs agreement with the Congress to leave it for its UPA ally.        
	This forced JMM chief Shibu Soren to fax a message to the local DC clarifying that Durga wasnt the official party nominee and that action should be taken against him if it was found that the signatures of the party president had been forged in forms (A, B) submitted by him.         
	But, Durga remained adamant today, even after senior party leaders Hemlal Murmu, Haji Hussain Ansari and Prasant Mandal visited him in Dumka to try and convince him about withdrawing.         
	Sources in Dumka said Durgas younger brother Hemant, however, told them that bhaiya will certainly withdraw his candidature tomorrow.         
	Both the JMM and the Congress know that if Durga remained in the fray, it would be the end of the seat-sharing agreement they had so painstakingly worked out.         
	Sitting Congress MP and party candidate from Godda Faruk Ansari was visibly upset. I dont know what he is up to. His action is beyond comprehension, he said.        
	The immediate fallout would be in the Jamtara Assembly segment from where Soren is set to contest to stake claim to the states leadership. But, Jamtara is an Assembly segment of the Dumka Lok Sabha seat, which the JMM chief is also contesting. And Furkan happens to be a five-time MLA from Jamtara, a constituency dominated by minorities.        
	Ironically, Durgas said he was contesting against his partys wishes to avenge his fathers defeat in the Tamar byelection. There was no UPA unity in Jharkhand. Had it been so, my father would not have lost in Tamar, he argued.        
	The Congress left the Jamtara seat for Guruji with the understanding that if he won, he would get another shot at forming the government _ that the Assembly was in suspended animation was the carrot he left dangling.        
	Initially, the Congress sealed a seven-five deal with the JMM for the Lok Sabha polls. Later, after much wrangling, they agreed upon friendly contests in Hazaribagh and Koderma.        
	Now both parties feel the deal would sink. State Congress president Pradeep Balmuchu said: Its all over for the UPA in Jharkhand if Durga remains in the fray. This is not the way coalition partners behave.

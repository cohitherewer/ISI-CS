The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Order to end varsity confusion
                                                                                                           Order to end varsity confusion
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 20: The human resource development ministry has ordered the University Grants Commission to withdraw a controversial notification allowing deemed universities to confuse students by calling themselves full-fledged universities.        
	The ministry has also dissociated itself from the UGC notification  reported by The Telegraph on April 28  in a written deposition submitted to Delhi High Court.        
	The HRD ministrys move comes in response to a case filed by a senior professor in Delhi High Court against the UGC notification, based on this newspapers report.        
	The UGC should withdraw its notification and communicate the same to all institutions deemed-to-be universities so that the latter refrain from using the word university with their names, states the ministrys order to the commission, dated August 10.        
	These institutions have traditionally had to call themselves deemed-to-be universities to allow students to distinguish them from universities.        
	But the UGC, through a notification, allowed these institutions to drop the prefix and call themselves universities.        
	The HRD ministrys order asking the UGC to withdraw this notification is the result of direct intervention by minister Kapil Sibal, sources said.        
	Sibal had already, on June 4, ordered a probe into the working of all deemed universities.        
	Now students will once again be able to differentiate between full-fledged universities and deemed universities, many of which are sub-standard, said Professor Kapil Kumar of the Indira Gandhi National Open University, who had challenged the notification.         
	Universities  public or private-run  can be set up in India only through acts of Parliament or a state legislature. Deemed university status is not granted to institutions through any law but through recognition under Section 3 of the UGC Act.        
	These institutions, unlike universities, are allowed to specialise in just a single stream, can set any fees they wish and cannot affiliate colleges. They are also out of the ambit of direct scrutiny from Parliament or state legislatures.        
	Under Sibals predecessor Arjun Singh, deemed universities mushroomed like never before, their number jumping by over a 100 between 2004 and 2009. India today has 129 deemed universities.        
	The UGC notification allowing deemed universities to call themselves universities required them to carry a proviso that they were recognised under Section 3 of the UGC Act.        
	UGC officials had argued that the proviso helped distinguish deemed universities from full-fledged universities. But few officials even in the HRD ministry know the significance of such a proviso.

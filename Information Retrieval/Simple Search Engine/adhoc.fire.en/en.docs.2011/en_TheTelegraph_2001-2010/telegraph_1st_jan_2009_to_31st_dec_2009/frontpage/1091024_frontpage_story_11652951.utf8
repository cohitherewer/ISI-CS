          OUR BUREAU                            Arunachal Calling: The Dalai Lama at Dharamsala. (PTI)                                        
	New Delhi/Itanagar, Oct. 23: The Dalai Lama, the supreme spiritual leader of the Buddhists, will visit Arunachal Pradesh for seven days from November 8 though China continues to oppose his trip to the Himalayan state.         
	The deputy commissioner of Tawang district, Gamli Padu, today confirmed the spiritual leaders visit. Dalai Lama will arrive at Tawang on November 8. He is scheduled to fly from Guwahati and reach Tawang at 10am, he said.         
	His itinerary includes inauguration of the OPD block of a super-speciality hospital in Tawang, preaching sermons and planting trees at the Yidgha Choezin ground during his stay at the district headquarters till November 13.         
	He will return to Itanagar on November 14 after a brief stopover at Bomdila. The Tibetan leader is expected to visit Theravada monastery at Vivek Vihar and Itanagar Gompa during his daylong stay at the state capital before leaving for Guwahati on November 15, Padu added.         
	This will be the Dalai Lamas fifth trip to Tawang, through which he had found an escape route while fleeing from Tibet at the height of Chinese aggression in 1959.         
	In the face of Chinas persistent protest against the spiritual leaders visit to Arunachal Pradesh, his trip had to be cancelled last year.         
	China has opposed his visit again this year, but following New Delhis assurance that the government had no plans to revert his trip plan, the monks at Tawang monastery are gearing up to welcome their spiritual leader.         
	Hundreds of monks and devotees of the Dalai Lama are holding prayers and special rituals every day to make his trip smooth.        
	China had also condemned the visit of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who went to Arunachal Pradesh for election campaign, without naming him on the day the state went to polls. However, Singh today pledged to deepen wide-ranging relations with East and Southeast Asia, the assurance coming on the eve of the India-Asean summit and the fourth East Asia summit.         
	Singhs statement came ahead of his departure for the summits in Thailand, where he will also hold talks with his Chinese counterpart Wen Jiabao tomorrow, sources said. This will be their first meeting since the strain in ties over the past month over issues surrounding the border dispute.        
	Speaking about the summits, Singh said he would discuss greater economic integration, people-to-people contacts, agriculture, science and technology and information and communications technology with the leaders of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).        
	Indias enhanced engagement with Asean is at the heart of our Look East policy. The conclusion of the India-Asean trade-in-goods (free trade) agreement in August was a major first step in our objective of creating an India-Asean regional trade and investment area, Singh said.         
	With the free-trade agreement clinched, India and Asean are now looking at inking a similar pact in the field of services and investment.        
	Trade with Asean has grown at a healthy rate and was around $48 billion in 2008, Singh said, adding he would inform the leaders in Thailand about the initiatives India had taken to qualitatively enhance its partnership.         
	The East Asia Summit brings together the Asean countries as well as Australia, New Zealand, India, China, Japan and South Korea. It will discuss Asias response to the global economic slowdown, food security, energy and climate change.

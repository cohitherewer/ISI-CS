The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Korea ex-President commits suicide
                                                                                                           Korea ex-President commits suicide
                                Roh Moo-hyun                            
	Seoul, May 23 (Reuters): South Koreas former President Roh Moo-hyun, hounded for weeks over his links while in office to a widening corruption scandal, appears to have jumped to his death in the mountains near his home today, a top aide said.        
	Local media quoted a note left by Roh which seemed to confirm his intention to commit suicide, asking for his body to be cremated and saying the rest of my life would only be a burden for others.        
	The likelihood of suicide could boost public sympathy for opponents of his conservative successor President Lee Myung-bak, whose hardline policies have largely overturned the more accommodating approach of Roh in key areas such as dealings with prickly North Korea and strike-prone labour unions.        
	Former President Roh left his house at 5.45am and while hiking on the Ponghwa Mountain, appears to have jumped off a rock at around 6.40am, Moon Jae-in, who was Rohs presidential chief of staff, said in a statement.        
	The 62-year-old former human rights lawyer, whose five-year term ended in February 2008, had recently become embroiled in a mounting graft inquiry, the result of confessions by a wealthy shoe manufacturer that he had bribed dozens of officials and politicians, as well as Rohs wife when she was First Lady.        
	This is a truly unbelievable, lamentable and deeply sad event, President Lee said in a statement issued by the presidential Blue House.        
	An official with the Busan University Hospital, in the southern port city near Rohs home, said the ex-leader had died from massive head injuries. Yonhap news agency quoted police as saying Roh had fallen some 20 to 30 metres to his death from Owl Rock.

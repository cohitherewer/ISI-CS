                                                                                                           Party mans alliance jab at Pranab 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Krishnagar, March 22: A Bengal Congress general secretary today said it was unbecoming of a senior leader like Pranab Mukherjee to threaten action against party workers unhappy about the deal with Mamata Banerjee.        
	Shankar Singh said: Congress workers are not being given the respect they deserve. We shall not surrender to the Trinamul Congress. If an alliance has to be forged, it has to be on the basis of mutual respect.         
	It was unbecoming of a senior leader like Pranabbabu to warn workers for speaking against the alliance. If they are unhappy, they can express their resentment, he added.         
	Nadia party president and MLA Ajoy De justified the anger in the party. Our workers have genuine grievances against the alliance. Mamata did not give us a seat here despite our strong presence.         
	After a meeting to discuss the alliance, De said: Our workers are unhappy at the way the alliance was struck.

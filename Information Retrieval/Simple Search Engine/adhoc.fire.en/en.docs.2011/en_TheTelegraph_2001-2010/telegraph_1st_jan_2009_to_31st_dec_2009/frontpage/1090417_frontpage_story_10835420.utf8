                                                                                                           Varun walks free, Maya keeps watch
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AND AGENCIES                            Varun after his release from Etah jail. (PTI)                                  
	Lucknow, April 16: Varun Gandhi walked out of jail this evening after the Supreme Court ordered his release on parole for two weeks.        
	The order was passed on the condition he would give a fresh undertaking not to disturb communal harmony.        
	Varun was booked under the stringent National Security Act last month for allegedly making anti-minority speeches in Pilibhit, from where he is contesting as a BJP candidate.        
	Before he left Etah jail around 5pm and drove away with mother Maneka Gandhi, the 29-year-old gave an undertaking to the jail superintendent that he would not make inflammatory speeches that threatened public order.        
	Earlier in the day, a bench headed by Chief Justice K. G. Balakrishnan said a similar undertaking would have to be given to the apex court. Varuns lawyer said it could be done by Monday.        
	We are inclined to release him on parole for two weeks on condition that he will give an undertaking that he will not make such speeches during the parole which are likely to cause communal disturbance, the judges had said.        
	Uttar Pradesh counsel Harish Salve objected to Varuns release, saying the authorities still saw him as a threat to public order.         
	The bench was not satisfied with the affidavit Varun had submitted earlier this week as a condition for his release, saying the contents could not be of his choice.        
	This is not sufficient. You should indicate what sort of undertaking you are giving. We will give the nature of the undertaking to be filed, the bench said.        
	Late in the evening, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavati said she did not trust he would honour such court undertakings.         
	She tried to draw a parallel with Kalyan Singh who, she pointed out, had furnished an affidavit saying he would protect the Babri Masjid but had failed to prevent its demolition in December 1992.        
	I dont trust Varuns undertaking. He could act like Kalyan Singh. Varun, after all, belongs to the same political party, the BJP, she said in Lucknow.        
	The chief minister left little doubt that her government would keep a watch on Varun while he was out on parole.         
	 Even after his release, if he dares to do anything that may cause law and order problems, my government would not hesitate to act even tougher than (it did) last time, she warned.        
	Mayavati did not specify whether the tougher action meant a re-arrest, but some state BJP leaders feared it was possible.         
	Varun is likely to file his nomination for the May 13 elections in Pilibhit on April 21, the leaders said.        
	The Congress argued that Varuns undertakings were a virtual admission that he had made the hate speeches.

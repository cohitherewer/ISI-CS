	Ranchi, Nov. 23: In the Kolhan region, Madhu Koda is drawing huge crowds. Milking his home turf advantage dry, the former chief minister is brazen. Mocking even his detractors who have put him at the centre of a Rs 2,000cr scam that has a whiff of everything from hawala to nondescript mines in Liberia.         
	Thanks to the media for making me more popular all for free, he declared in front of a cheering crowd, some of whom perched atop buses that brought them to the Gandhi Maidan in Chaibasa.         
	Irrespective of whether the seven nominees of his fledgling Jharkhand Nav Nirman Morcha win or not, Koda has managed the impossible. He has deftly manoeuvred his campaign to turn a personal disadvantage into a virtue  something only possible in a politically unpredictable state like Jharkhand.         
	And so, on the eve of the states five-phased Assembly elections beginning Wednesday, Koda is basking in the glory of having successfully made himself the pivot of this campaign. No matter how much they try, both Congress and BJP dont quite know what to do with this adivasi, a former RSS man who is not only undaunted by the nation-wide raids on him and his associates, but displays the gall to attain king-maker status.         
	When Rahul Gandhi came to campaign in Ranchi last week, corruption wasnt part of his discourse. The BJP, too, even though it has come into this election as favourites  it won eight of the states 14 Lok Sabha seats  is wary of going all out to pin the Congress for having propped up the Koda regime.        
	Mining lease kickbacks, income tax and Enforcement Directorate officials believe, was one of the ways in which Koda and his clique amassed wealth. But before becoming chief minister in September 2006, Koda was mining minister during BJP chief minister Arjun Mundas tenure from March 2005. May be thats why the BJP has fallen back on the aam admi and designed a manifesto that talks of free rice/wheat at Re 1 per kg and farmers loans at 2 per cent interest.        
	The Koda association has forced the Congress to strike an alliance with Babulal Marandi, the most credible face of Jharkhand politics today. The Jharkhand Vikas Morcha is contesting 19 of the 81 seats on its own according to the deal that many believe is the only hope for the Congress to try and shake off the baggage of having supported a regime of independents that turned out to be inefficient and corrupt.         
	So nervous is it about an emboldened Koda, who is painting himself as a martyr, that the Congress is despatching a host of senior leaders to convince a suspicious electorate of its good intentions. If the likes of Ajay Maken, a former party in-charge for Jharkhand affairs, went ahead and promised to bring back the money looted from the state if they were voted to power, the Congress leadership failed to showcase the administratively sound tenure of Governor K. Sankaranarayanan.        
	The BJP-JD(U) alliance on the other hand is time-tested. Initial hiccups on seat-sharing notwithstanding, the NDA combine has more to lose in the first phase of voting for 26 seats, 14 of which are in the Santhal Pargana region where the JMM is struggling to retain its hold.         
	Among the 26 seats, the BJP-JD(U) combine has sitting MLAs in as many as 15. Strategically, it is more concerned about Marandi, once the face of the BJP in Santhal Pargana before he quit the saffron combine in 2006. Realising the JVM has the potential to damage its prospects most, the BJP has gone to the extent of fielding weak candidates (in Jama, Jamtara) to make it easier for the JMM.         
	As far as the two alliances go, the BJP-JD(U) combine has managed to project a united face. BJP stalwarts like L.K. Advani and Rajnath Singh have campaigned together with JD(U)s Sharad Yadav and Nitish Kumar. So far, the Congress has had one joint rally by Sonia Gandhi and Marandi in Dumka.         
	Outside of Santhal Pargana, both NDA and the Congress are running neck and neck. In the South Chhotanagpur region, both parties are locked in straight fights in Ranchi, Hatia and Kanke. In the Singhbhum region, state BJP chief Raghubar Das doesnt seem as confident as before in Jamshedpur (East), while sitting BJP MLA Sarayu Roy has trouble on his hands in the form of a Banna Gupta, a Samajwadi Party turncoat the Congress has fielded in Jamshedpur (West).         
	The real test of this election is to see if the Congress-Marandi alliance works. It will, Marandi told The Telegraph in a conversation a week ago.         
	The numbers may seem heavily weighed in favour of the Congress, and it may well be so. But keeping the ultimate objective (of forming a government) in mind, we agreed to such a deal, he said at his new party office, explaining the rationale behind the 19 seats the JVM agreed to contest.         
	Its do or die for Marandi and his JVM. The Congress can only hope for the best.

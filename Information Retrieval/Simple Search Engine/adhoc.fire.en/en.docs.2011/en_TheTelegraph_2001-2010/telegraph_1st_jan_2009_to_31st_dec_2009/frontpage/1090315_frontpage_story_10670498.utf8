The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Couples can tie knot on Juliets balcony
                                                                                                           Couples can tie knot on Juliets balcony
          NICK SQUIRES                            Juliets balcony in Verona, Italy                                  
	Perugia (Italy), March 14: Romantic couples searching for the perfect wedding spot can now tie the knot on the Verona balcony immortalised by Shakespeare in Romeo and Juliet.         
	Verona officials hope the move will make the northwest of Italian city one of the worlds wedding capitals.        
	Well be offering tourist packages which include weddings, just like Las Vegas does, said Daniele Potalo, the citys councillor for tourism. Its a way of using the citys artistic heritage to boost tourism.        
	But the privilege of getting hitched in the courtyard where, legend has it, Romeo wooed his young lover, will not come cheap. Britons and other EU nationals will be charged 800 euros (740). Couples from outside the EU must pay 1,000 euros.        
	Locals will have to pay a comparatively cheap 600 euros, although that is still expensive when compared with an ordinary marriage certificate in Italy, which costs just 50 euros.        
	The scheme, which will be formally launched in the next few days, will be known as Sposami a Verona  Marry Me in Verona.        
	The balcony is part of a 14th century building known as Juliets House, which was once the home of the Cappello family  possibly the model for the Capulets of Shakespeares play.        
	It had to be closed a year ago so that it could be scrubbed clean of graffiti messages and blobs of bubble gum left on its walls by tourists.        
	The balcony is a big tourist draw for Verona, but historians say there is little evidence linking it to Shakespeares tragic love story.        
	Although the Capulet and the Montague families did exist, there is no record of them engaging in a feud, and Romeo and Juliet are entirely fictional characters.        
	Notwithstanding the lack of historical fact, the courtyard beneath the balcony contains a bronze statue of Juliet. It is the custom for visitors hoping to be lucky in love to stroke her right breast, which is now highly polished.

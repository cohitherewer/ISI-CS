          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Shillong, July 11: Union minister of state for rural development Agatha Sangma today expressed concern over leakage of funds meant for development in the rural areas and promised strict monitoring of the schemes.        
	Speaking to reporters after the felicitation function organised by the North East Co-ordination Committee of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), Sangma said both the Union and state governments needed to strictly monitor the central rural development schemes for their effective implementation.        
	Reacting to a question on the leakage of funds to militants groups in the Northeast, she said it was the duty of every state government to check law and order problems so that funds meant for development reached the right hands.        
	Law and order is a state subject and every state government in the Northeast should pull up its socks to contain anti-development elements, she said.        
	Sangma said she was committed to ensuring more vigilance and monitoring on the part of both the Centre and state governments so that the people were not deprived of the fruits of development.        
	She also asked the state governments to ensure proper utilisation of allotted funds so that more funds could be availed for development in the rural areas.        
	She said since there were complaints from many quarters about loopholes in the implementation of rural development schemes, she was ready to analyse reports suggesting such irregularities in order to take corrective measures.        
	We do receive reports regarding irregularities in the implementation of schemes and we need to constantly follow up the recommendations of the reports so that there is effective implementation of schemes, she added.         
	She said the Union rural development ministry would stress on convergence of rural welfare schemes, including the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY), the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) and the Indira Awas Yojana (IAY) so as to reap the benefits of these schemes.

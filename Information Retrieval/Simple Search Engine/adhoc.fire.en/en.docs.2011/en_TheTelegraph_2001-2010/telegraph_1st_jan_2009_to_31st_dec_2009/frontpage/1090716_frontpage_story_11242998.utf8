                                Darwin: Fresh look                            
	London, July 15 (PTI): The University of Cambridge has announced a ground-breaking new study to examine the impact of Charles Darwins ideas on attitudes to gender and sexuality.        
	The Darwin and Gender project will make available for the first time, in a single resource, the naturalists private and largely unpublished writings relevant to all aspects of gender. In particular, a large body of Darwins own letters.        
	The research for the three-year project will be conducted by the Darwin Correspondence Project at Cambridge University Library.        
	It is anticipated that the project will illuminate such private relationships as that of Darwin with his elder daughter, Henrietta.        
	Too young to be involved in the writing of the Origin of Species, her influence is likely to be seen in the writing of The Descent of Man, Darwins first public statement on human evolution, a university release said. The naturalist had a surprisingly large number of female friends with whom he exchanged letters throughout his life.        
	The initiative will provide accurate transcripts of the letters and research and provide matter for contextual material to make them accessible to both scholars and the general public.        
	Project director Prof. Jim Secord said: These are extraordinary letters that deserve a wide audience. Differences between the sexes played a key role in Darwins thinking, which in turn had a major impact on Victorian society.

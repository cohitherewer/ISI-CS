The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | How smooth was our Metro ride 
                                                                                                           How smooth was our Metro ride     -  Calcuttas pride is turning into a shame. The Telegraph looks at what ails the system
          OUR BUREAU                                                    
	Sept. 6: If a ridiculed little brother could cry mere paas ma hai, an ignored city could always retort we have our Metro.        
	Not any more.        
	Metro Rail, the system that could bail out Calcutta when everything else failed, has suddenly become a problem child.        
	Metro Rail officials had blamed birth pangs in the face of commuter complaints soon after the 5.83km Tollygunge-Kavi Nazrul (Garia Bazar) stretch was opened on August 23. A fortnight later, the commuter system seems to be in prolonged labour.        
	On Sunday, sparks flew beneath the compartments after a loud thud, the fault escaping a preliminary round of inspection and the train allowed to proceed to the next station. (See chart above)        
	Technicians eventually tracked down the problem  a broken tie-rod that links braking appliances to a set of wheels. Officials insisted that the rod that wriggled free was one among many and it would not have led to a disaster.         
	The chain reaction affected other trains, too. Officials said two trains got delayed by 20 minutes but many Metro commuters said they were held for an hour.         
	Although no one was injured, the dramatic events underscored how Metro Rail has been slipping and losing the trust of Calcuttans day by day. With the Puja shopping season slipping into its busiest leg, even a delay of 20 minutes means stifling chaos on what was once the only thing that works in Calcutta.        
	On weekdays, too, a Metro journey no longer symbolises what it stood for once: reliability, reassuring comfort and a remarkable sense of order beneath the disorder overhead.        
	The Telegraph lists complaints repeated over the past two weeks by commuters, the victims of Metro Rails lack of planning and common sense.                     
	The Dum Dum-Garia Bazaar running time is meant to be 41 minutes. The gap between trains in peak time is meant to be six minutes. But trains are slowing down on the new stretch because of lack of route familiarisation among drivers. Doors are often not closing properly because of overcrowding. Use of the old block signalling system is forcing one train to wait two stations behind the earlier one. The Metro timetable has gone haywire, with delays of 10 minutes and more.                      
	Passenger count has gone up by around 40 per cent, taking Metro officials by surprise. What else did they expect when Metro extended itself to an area that witnessed explosive growth in the past decade?        
	The number of rakes has gone up from 14 to 17, which is inadequate. Till new rakes hit the tracks sometime in October, crowd crush is unavoidable. Beware of more Metro madness in the run-up to and during Durga Puja.              
	Till the route extension happened, Metro was operating 134 booking counters in 17 stations with 325 employees. That was inadequate at peak hours. Now, the same number is manning counters in 21 stations. The results are there for all to see and be scared off by  serpentine queues, often reaching the stairs, while roughly half the ticket counters are open. Confusion over tech upgrade of turnstiles is adding to the chaos.                    
	Lack of proper announcements, with display boards as mere decorative props, especially when trains are running late.        
	The Metro public address system is either silent or vague, with words like soon being used repeatedly to signal arrival of a train running late. The system of alerting commuters entering the Metro tunnel about delays, snags or overcrowding is not activated. On Sunday at Jatin Das Park, no train reached from Tollygunge for more than 45 minutes since 3.26pm because of the spark scare. But the first announcement was made at 4.01pm, the content of which was revised till 4.11pm.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Transparency blow to CJI 
                                                                                                           Transparency blow to CJI 
  - Information act applies: High court        SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                            Balakrishnan                                        
	New Delhi, Sept. 2: Delhi High Court today said the office of the Chief Justice of India was a public authority under the transparency law and would have to disclose any information it holds, including judges assets, except maybe for their break-up.        
	The ruling came as a personal blow to CJI K.G. Balakrishnan, who had last week declared he would resist tooth and nail any attempt to share confidential information about appointments and transfers of judges and insisted that his office be kept outside the purview of the Right to Information Act.        
	Some information we can share, he had told reporters at a media conference in the Supreme Court. But not all.        
	But high court judge S. Ravinder Bhatt said the CJI was a public authority under the act.  The CJI holds the information pertaining to asset declarations in his capacity as Chief Justice; that office is a public authority under the act and is covered by its provisions, the judge said in his 72-page ruling.        
	There is no clue in these provisions (RTI Act) that the office of the Chief Justice of India is exempt; on the contrary, internal indications in the enactment point even to the President of India being covered by the act Justice Bhatt said.        
	The judge, however, added that contents of declaration of assets  break-up and investments of judges and their dependants  would be treated as personal information and divulged only if public interest outweighed private interest of a judge in a particular case.        
	The judgment came against the backdrop of intense debate on the issue and last weeks decision by all Supreme Court judges to make public their assets on the courts official website.        
	The ruling followed an application filed under the information law. The applicant had sought information on whether all judges disclose their assets to the CJI in accordance with a 1997 resolution of the apex court.        
	The Supreme Court central public information officer (CPIO) had refused to part with the information and appealed to the high court against a Central Information Commission order that had declared the CJIs office a public authority and directed it to share the information.        
	Justice Bhatt directed the CPIO to release the information within four weeks. The judge dismissed the officers contention that the in-house exercise was voluntary and the disclosures made to the CJI were made not in his official but personal capacity and were confidential, a view espoused by the CJI.        
	The CJI does not hold information about asset declarations in a fiduciary capacity or relationship, Justice Bhatt said.        
	On the CPIOs contention that declaration of assets by judges was voluntary, Bhatt said it would be highly anomalous to say that in the exercise of legitimate jurisdiction that impacts peoples lives, judges had no obligation to disclose their personal assets to someone in authority.        
	All power  judicial power being no exception  is held accountable in a modern Constitution, he said.        
	Legal experts welcomed the verdict though activist lawyer Prashant Bhushan said the part on not disclosing the asset break-up was the only catch in todays ruling, expected to trigger a flood of applications for information unless, of course, the apex court immediately challenges it and gets a stay.        
	Attorney-general G.E. Vahanvati, who represented the Supreme Court in the high court, said the apex court would appeal against the ruling.        
	I think the judgment is a superb example of judicial independence. The fact that the Supreme Court registrar was in effect representing the entire body of judges representing the Supreme Court did not deter the judge from dealing with a highly sensitive and controversial issue is wholly correct, constitutional lawyer K.K. Venugopal told PTI.        
	But critics of the judgment said information demand from the public would bring judges under considerable pressure and erode the independence of the judiciary in the long run.

          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY IN KANDHAMAL                        Kamita Nayak with one of her four children in the Raikia camp in Kandhamal. Kamita, a Christian, said her husband died of shock after the family was thrown out of their village, Chanchedi in Ranipada, during the riots. She has no source of income and nowhere to go if the relief camp is shut down as the inmates fear. Kamita said she would not be allowed back into the village unless she converted to Hinduism.

	The battle for the hearts and souls of tribals, deep inside Orissa, has turned this once idyllic place 2,000 feet above sea level into a killing field.        
	Much is at stake for the BJP  the outcome in the Kandhamal parliamentary seat will decide whether the party can replicate its Gujarat model of Hindutva here.        
	For the peace-loving Kuis, the heady mix of religion and politics has meant violence and tension.        
	The community is split right down the middle, into Kui-speaking Kondh tribals and Kui-speaking Scheduled Castes.        
	The tribal Kondhs resent recent attempts by the Scheduled Caste Pana converts to Christianity to claim reservation benefits. All hell broke loose when a BJD minister, Padmanabha Behera, demanded Scheduled Tribe status for the converts on the ground of linguistic affinity with the Kui tribals. In the clashes that followed, 50 died and dozens were injured.        
	Burnt-down huts and churches stand testimony to the violence that scorched the zone.        
	The entry of missionaries meant more schools  theres a Carmel convent and a Saint Catherines in the area  and orphanages.         
	Now, for every missionary institution, theres a satsang kendra.        
	Tribal identities used to be primal here, religion came next. In the land of the poor, it was all about doles, not souls.        
	After years of neglect, the tribals lined up for whoever was offering them anything. Even if some of them went to church, there was never a formal switch to Christianity. Religious identities were nebulous.        
	Half of a family could be Hindu, the other half Christian. It helped them claim reservation benefits as tribals. All this changed after the riots.        
	Today, theres deep and simmering anger among the tribals, who make up 52 per cent of the local population, against what they see as usurpation of their rights.        
	The Christians have been helping themselves to reservation benefits, says Kui leader Bhabani Pradhan.        
	He blames the community for Swami Laxmanandas killing last August which triggered the riots. The swami opposed both conversion and cow slaughter. Who stands to benefit from his death? The Christian community.        
	Andrews Digal, whose home now is a relief camp in Raikia, Kandhamal, says: Five Christians were murdered. We fled in the middle of the night when we realised a mob was coming our way. Our houses were burnt down with diesel and petrol.        
	Digal had just an acre of land. Now that is gone. The riots have made him poorer.        
	His tribal counterpart is just as poor. Thats what makes the fight for votes in the name of religion ironical.        
	Officially, the BJP is cagey about admitting this. Party in-charge of the state Chandan Mitra would only say the BJP  which shared power with the ruling BJD before chief minister Naveen Patnaik walked out  wants to replicate the Karnataka model in Orissa, where elections to the Assembly will be held along with those to the Lok Sabha.        
	Our strategy is to get as many seats as possible so that we can force re-election and come back to power on our own, he says. Thats what happened in Karnataka. We aligned with somebody, got betrayed, but came back to power on our own.        
	The BJP is focusing all its energies on using the emotive issue of Laxmanandas murder to polarise voters.        
	One of the many ads placed in major Oriya dailies urges self-respecting Oriyas to vote for the BJP. Laxmananda was killed because he was leading the tribal struggle to retain their culture, land, water and forests, it says.         
	The party has fielded controversial Hindu Jagaran Sammukhya leader and former IPS officer Ashok Sahu from Kandhamal. Sahu was taken into custody on Tuesday for an alleged hate speech.  
	Kandhamal votes today

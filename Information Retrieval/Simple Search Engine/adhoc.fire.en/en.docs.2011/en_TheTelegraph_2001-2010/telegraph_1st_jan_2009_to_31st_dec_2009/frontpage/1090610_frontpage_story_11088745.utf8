                                                                                                           Kabul pat for terror lawyer
  - Commendation letter for defending alleged Afghan militants        ANANYA SENGUPTA                            Shanwar Khan                                        
	New Delhi, June 9: Shanwar Khan, a Delhi lawyer who is defending 44 terror suspects, has got a pat on his back from Afghanistan.         
	Shanwar, 35, popularly known as terror lawyer among his peers, will receive a commendation letter from the Afghan embassy appreciating his efforts to defend alleged terrorists from that country who are in jail in India under the Arms Act.        
	He was invited to the embassy today to receive the honour, but because of an error in the official letter, the ceremony was postponed.        
	The embassy here said the letter, written in Persian and signed by the deputy foreign minister of Afghanistan, will be handed over to Shanwar as soon as it is translated into English and the error rectified.        
	The letter, written in Persian, says Kabul appreciates Shanwars efforts at defending its citizens arrested on Indian soil and thanks him for providing his services for free. It adds that the commendation comes as per the oral directive of the President of Afghanistan.        
	I am very happy and honoured. I will get the letter in a day or two. My name was spelt incorrectly, so they wanted to change it, Shanwar said.        
	The lawyer, who is defending some of the accused in the recent Delhi blasts, received an official request from the embassy two months ago asking him to take up the case of eight Afghans arrested in Jammu and Kashmir under the Arms Act in 1997.        
	Shanwar complied.         
	The case was shifted to Jodhpur on the special intervention of the Supreme Court, which also directed the court to settle the matter in one year. But for six months the case is stuck because the original chargesheet was filed in Urdu and needed to be translated first. Now, after I was appointed by the embassy, I am getting the translation done at my end. The process is still on and hearing will begin shortly, he said.        
	An Afghan embassy official said Shanwar was appointed the counsel of the eight alleged terrorists after families of the accused requested the Afghan Presidents office to take up the matter with India.        
	These people have been in custody for more than 14 years while the punishment in the Arms Act is less than that. Everyone has the right to fair trial and I am here to ensure that. Its my duty to defend the Constitution of my country. I do hope I will be able to help plug the loopholes in our legal and crime investigation process, the lawyer said.         
	His name first came into the limelight when he offered to represent the 26/11 accused Ajmal Amir Kasab.        
	Out of the 20 cases that have gone to trial, Shanwar has been able to get six acquitted.

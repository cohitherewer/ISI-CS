                                                                                                           Social sector pitch in state budget
  - Stand-in finance minister tables vote-on-account        SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                                    
	Ranchi, Feb. 17: Stand-in finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today tabled Jharkhands interim budget in the Lok Sabha, seeking to continue with the theme of connecting with the aam aadmi by allocating a whopping Rs 4,263 crore to the social sector.        
	A day after he presented the Centres interim budget capping almost five years of UPA rule, Mukherjee pumped in more than half of Jharkhands annual plan size of Rs 8,200 crore to schemes that would hopefully see new roads being carved out in Naxalite-hit regions in addition to rural development projects.        
	In keeping with convention, Mukherjee proposed no new taxes for the next fiscal as he sought a vote-on-account of Rs 9,014.96 crore for the first four months of the financial year. It included Rs 5.82 crore for the governors secretariat, Rs 2,428.51 crore for paying interest on loans and Rs 88.08 crore for holding Lok Sabha elections.        
	The budget size has been pegged at Rs 22,000.06 crore.        
	Jharkhand has been under Presidents rule since January 19 when the state was plunged into a political crisis after then chief minister Shibu Soren lost the Tamar by-election that would provide him a berth in the Assembly.         
	But since the Assembly has been kept under suspended animation  a move widely opposed by the Opposition BJP  it was imperative the state budget was approved by both houses of Parliament.        
	Union minister of state for finance P.K. Bansal presented the budget in the Rajya Sabha.        
	Social welfare, food and civil supply, rural development, energy received the highest priority with an allocation of Rs 840 crore, Rs 290 crore, Rs 750 crore and Rs 725 crore, respectively.        
	G. Krishnan, the adviser to Governor Syed Sibtey Razi, said the states focus was on rural development and social welfare. We are also focusing on making approach roads in Naxalite areas, he said.        
	Besides, Krishnan said this time development schemes would be cleared in the first two months of the fiscal so that field executives were able to get a full working season  from September to March  to execute the schemes.        
	The Planning Commission today agreed with the state governments plan size of Rs 8,200 crore after a meeting chaired by plan panel member B.K. Chaturvedi and attended by, among others, chief secretary A.K. Basu. Development commissioner S.K. Chaudhary said from New Delhi that the plan would be approved after the governor held a meeting with deputy chairperson M.S. Ahluwalia.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Dumka, Nov. 13: In a pre-poll jolt to the JVM(P), at least three trusted lieutenants of Babulal Marandi today deserted the party and joined the BJP.        
	Vinod Sharma and Som Marandi, vice-presidents of JVM(P)s central committee, and Mira Thakur, general secretary of the partys women cell, severed ties with Marandi who they claimed had little concern for grassroots workers. The trio, once BJP turncoats, returned to their old party with more than 200 JVM(P) workers in tow. Its Dumka convener Gourishanker Yadav, too, entered the BJP fold.         
	Som, who had represented the Rajmahal Lok Sabha seat on a BJP ticket in 1989, was promised candidature from Littipara Assembly seat this time. But the JVM(P)s pre-poll arrangement with the Congress has scuttled his chances and this is believed to be the main reason behind his exit.         
	Marandi seemed unfazed by the development. I was expecting this to happen as we signed a deal with the Congress, he said. The former chief minister contended that he could not have given ticket to everybody even if the JVM(P) had chosen to go it alone.         
	A buoyed BJP, meanwhile, commemorated what it called ghar vapasi (homecoming) of leaders. State party president Raghubar Das and Godda MP Nishikant Dubey were present on the occasion. Das said more would join his party. Desertion will finish the JVM.

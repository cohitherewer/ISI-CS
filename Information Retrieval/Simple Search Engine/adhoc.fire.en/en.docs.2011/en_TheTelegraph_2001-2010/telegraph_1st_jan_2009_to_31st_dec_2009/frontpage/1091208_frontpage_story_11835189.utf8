          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 7: On the eve of tomorrows third phase of voting, home minister P. Chidambaram has appealed to the people to come out in large numbers and spoil the Maoists plans of boycotting the polls.        
	I recall with satisfaction that in the first phase the turnout was 53.1 per cent and in the second phase the turnout was 58.8 per cent, Chidambaram said in a statement, the third since elections began in the state on November 25.        
	Chidambaram said the high turnout was due to administrative and security measures taken by the Election Commission and was confident the third phase would also witness an impressive turnout.        
	Let us remember that elections constitute the foundation of a democracy and it is important that every voter plays his/her part in strengthening this foundation, he said, echoing the same line of thought he expressed in the Rajya Sabha last week.         
	 Jharkhand is a test case as much for the government as for the Congress. If polling percentage is high  and this time many from the Party Unity faction of the CPI(Maoist) are also contesting polls  the Centre would have a moral victory over Maoist propaganda.

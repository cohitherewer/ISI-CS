The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | IIMC sticks to retest demand 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                IIMC sticks to retest demand 
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI       
	New Delhi, Dec. 14: IIM directors bickered at length yesterday over whether to scrap this years glitch-ridden computerised Common Admission Test and re-conduct a pencil-and-paper examination.        
	The tense meeting was held ahead of talks with the human resource development ministry on Wednesday.         
	The chiefs failed to reach a consensus after IIM Calcutta director Shekhar Chaudhari refused to agree to accept the results of the computerised test without consulting his faculty.        
	As tensions rose at the meeting, some even suggested that those IIMs seeking a retest officially break with the rest and conduct their own examination, sources said. The IIMs have always admitted students through a single examination -- the CAT.         
	Chaudhari today convened an emergency meeting with his faculty association. But the teachers refused to drop their demand for a re-conducted pencil-and-paper test, echoed by the faculty of the IIMs in Ahmedabad and Bangalore.        
	The split among the directors may now show up at a meeting on Wednesday between the IIMs and the HRD ministry to evaluate options to restore the credibility of the CAT.        
	Faculty associations at IIMs in Ahmedabad, Bangalore and Calcutta have passed resolutions demanding that the directors -- the executive authorities -- scrap this years computerised test and re-conduct a traditional version.         
	Such a move alone would help assure thousands of IIM aspirants that they received a fair opportunity at selection this year, the faculty associations have said.        
	But the meeting among the directors in Mumbai yesterday began with Ahmedabad and Bangalore demanding that the IIMs stick to the already conducted test, the sources said.         
	Directors of Ahmedabad and Bangalore indicated that scrapping this years computerised test was not an option, and could lead to greater embarrassment for the institutes, the sources said.        
	The directors keen to accept the computerised test felt that the number of complaints had reduced over the 10-day period of the test.         
	But Prometric, the US-based company that conducted the examination, has accepted in its latest statement that apart from over 8,000 students who could not take the test at their scheduled slot, at least another 20,000 were adversely affected by the glitches.         
	The directors have been considering a retest proposal this year ever since technical problems affected thousands of candidates over the first few days of the computerised examination.         
	The proposal, first reported by The Telegraph on December 2, was backed at the time by the directors of all IIMs -- Calcutta, Lucknow, Indore, Kozhikode and Shillong -- other than Ahmedabad and Bangalore.         
	But at the meeting yesterday, IIM Shillong director Ashoke Dutta suggested that the demand for the retest in a pencil-and-paper format be dropped. Chaudhari, however, said that given the sentiments of the faculty in Ahmedabad, Bangalore and Calcutta, reconducting the test may be wise, the sources said.         
	After the seven directors failed to agree on a common position, Chaudhari sought a day to consult his faculty.         
	But the failure to convince his faculty means the IIMs will enter their Wednesday meeting with the HRD ministry as a divided house.

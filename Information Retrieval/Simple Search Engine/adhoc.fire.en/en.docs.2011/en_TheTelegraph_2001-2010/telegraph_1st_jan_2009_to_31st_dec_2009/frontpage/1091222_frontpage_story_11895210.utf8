  - Speaker asks Lok Sabha TV bosses not to beam unruly behaviour           ARCHIS MOHAN                            Meira Kumar                                        
	New Delhi, Dec. 21: If you cant stop a nuisance, hide it.        
	Speaker Meira Kumar has instructed Lok Sabha TV bosses to show less of unruly behaviour by MPs and more of her, sources associated with the channel said.        
	She wants the cameras to focus on the Chair when the House turns chaotic with the members, say, storming the well.        
	One official, however, said: This has less to do with protecting the prestige of the House than with a strategy to conduct business in an effective manner.        
	The Speaker, he explained, felt that showing MPs creating bedlam fuels further bad behaviour.        
	The members are conscious that their actions are being filmed and these visuals would later be repeated on private channels. This spurs them on to get unruly more often, the official said.        
	Meiras instructions, however, are in stark contrast to predecessor Somnath Chatterjees desire to let the world see what MPs do inside Parliament.         
	Chatterjee had been the prime mover behind Lok Sabha TV becoming a separate channel and telecasting the entire days proceedings instead of just question hour.        
	There are strict guidelines, though, on how House proceedings can be covered. For example, the cameras are not allowed to linger on the media or the visitors galleries. The Speaker can exercise his or her discretion on the amount of time the cameras can devote to the spots of disorder inside the House.        
	In recent times, therefore, Lok Sabha TV has focused more on the Chairs efforts to get the House in order than on members shouting at one another.        
	To all appearances, viewers love the ugly bits. During the July 2008 trust vote debate, when wads of notes were waved inside the House, the channel had become one of Indias most watched.        
	At a shoestring budget of barely Rs 7 crore a year, the kind of TRPs (television rating points) we get are brilliant, an official said. Of course, there are hidden subsidies like getting a transponder and the premises free of cost.

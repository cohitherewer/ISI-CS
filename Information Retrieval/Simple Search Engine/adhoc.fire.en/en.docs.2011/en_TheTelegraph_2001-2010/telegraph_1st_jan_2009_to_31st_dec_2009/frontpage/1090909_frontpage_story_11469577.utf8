          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranchi, Sept. 8: After three days of incessant rain, this late burst of monsoon showers has weakened as the deep depression that had its centre in Jharkhand has now shifted to Madhya Pradesh.         
	 Met office predicted dry days for the next few days, beginning tomorrow. It has, however, not ruled out the possibility of scattered rainfall in a few places across the state during the next 24 hours.        
	 The centre of deep depression has shifted to Madhya Pradesh. But, some areas around Jharkhand may get some rainfall due to local weather developments, said G.K. Mohanty, the director of Ranchi Met office.         
	During the past 24 hours, Jharkhand received scattered rainfall.         
	While Ranchi recorded a rainfall of 6.7 mm, in Jamshepdur it was 14.4 mm, while even the rain shadow region of Daltonganj received 22.6 mm.         
	Life in the state capital, which had been thrown out of gear due to the rains in the last three days, was slowly limping back to normalcy.         
	Residents, whose homes were flooded by gushing waters, particularly in low lying areas, saw some hope once the sun emerged from the clouds after a span of 72 hours.

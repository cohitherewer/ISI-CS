                                                                                                           Morcha team ready for talks 
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Jan. 20: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha will send a seven-member delegation to meet the chief minister in Calcutta tomorrow.        
	The Morcha leaders today agreed to the bilateral talks unconditionally, budging from the stand taken earlier. Party president Bimal Gurung had yesterday linked the acceptance of the chief ministers talks offer to police permission to hold rallies in the Dooars.        
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had wanted to talk to Gurung immediately to avert ethnic clashes in Jalpaiguri and other parts of north Bengal, home secretary Ardhendu Sen had said at Writers Buildings yesterday.        
	In the Dooars, nine gram panchayat members resigned today. Yesterday, the Morcha had given them a deadline of 3pm today for putting in their papers. The hill party, however, had not said what would happen if the members did not resign.        
	Three companies of the SSB have been deployed in Malbazar, Nagrakata and Banarhat to maintain law and order. More than 3,000 Morcha supporters had started for Nagarkata for a rally today, but were stopped at Meen Glass More where they demonstrated, media and publicity secretary of the party Binay Tamang said. He added that an all-party meeting may be held in Jalpaiguri tomorrow.

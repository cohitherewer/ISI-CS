The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Golliwog? Not a jolly good joke
                                                                                                           Golliwog? Not a jolly good joke
  - BBC removes Thatchers daughter for racist remark on tennis player          AMIT ROY                                                    
	London, Feb. 4: Carol Thatcher, the 55-year-old daughter of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, was yesterday sacked by the BBC from her role as roving reporter on a television programme after she compared a tennis player in the Australian Open to a golliwog.        
	Carol described her remark, made not on air but in a private conversation in the green room, as a light-hearted joke but the BBC deemed the comment racist and dismissed her after she apparently refused to issue an unconditional apology.        
	Although the tennis player has not been identified, the Daily Mail speculated that she had referred to a black tennis player, understood to be Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, noted for his physical resemblance to Muhammad Ali.         
	Carols sense of humour was not shared either by Adrian Chiles, co-presenter of The One Show where her job was to report on a wide variety of issues and interview a range of people throughout Britain.        
	It is understood that when Carol made her remark, Chiles immediately took her to task and some of the production staff and a guest who was present also felt she had been guilty of a lapse of taste.        
	It is not clear whether Carol, who sometimes reviews newspapers for the BBC on a flagship Sunday morning show, is now banned from all other programmes.        
	A statement from the BBC said: We will no longer be working with Carol Thatcher on The One Show. The BBC considers any language of a racist nature wholly unacceptable.        
	A BBC source pointed out: There were a number of complaints from people in the room about this particular remark; it did cause offence. A number of people were quite taken aback by the language.        
	Carol herself said she was baffled by the dismissal while her spokesperson told one newspaper: Carol never intended any racist comment. She made a light aside about this tennis player and his similarity to the golliwog on the jam pot when she was growing up.        
	Theres no way, obviously, that she would condone any racist comment  we would refute that entirely. It would not be in her nature to do anything like that.        
	The spokesperson added Carol was mortified that the content of an off-air conversation had been disclosed by a BBC employee and that anyone should take offence at a silly joke. She has summarily apologised.        
	There will now inevitably be conflicting opinions on whether the BBC has reacted in an entirely defensible manner or whether it has overreacted.        
	The former chairman of the Conservative Party, Lord (Norman) Tebbit, a right-winger and a loyal follower of the Thatcher doctrine, said: It is probably a bit of a way for the BBC to get back at Carols mother.        
	Another Conservative MP, Phillip Davies, who sits on the Commons media select committee, said: Carols comments are indefensible and if she has caused offence then it is the BBCs right to remove her.        
	But, it does seem to me to be the height of double standards. Are the BBC saying that Carols comments are more offensive than when (BBC presenter) Jonathan Ross called up a 78-year-old and shouted lewd messages detailing sexual acts with his granddaughter? It does seem there is one rule for Ross and another for others.        
	Compared with her twin brother, Mark, who has been a controversial character for his numerous dodgy business dealings and for getting involved in an attempted coup in Africa, Carol has been the sensible one in her family.        
	Though she has had a few romances, notably with former Tory MP and later jailbird Jonathan Aitken, she has never married. She worked as a feature writer on The Daily Telegraph but was sacked by the editor, Max Hastings, while her mother was Prime Minister.        
	Her career revived after she was crowned queen of the jungle after winning the 2005 series of Im A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!, which was filmed in the Australian outback.        
	No one would seriously entertain the notion that Carol is racist, but she may have absorbed some of her values from her mother who once made the notorious remark that many in Britain feared the country was being rather swamped by people of a different culture.

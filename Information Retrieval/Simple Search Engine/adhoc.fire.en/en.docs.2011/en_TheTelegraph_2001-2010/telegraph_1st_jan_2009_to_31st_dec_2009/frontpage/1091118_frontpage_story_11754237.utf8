          OUR BUREAU                                      
	New Delhi, Nov. 17: A US government task force has opposed routine mammography for women in their forties. It has recommended the breast cancer screening procedure only for women above 50 years once every two years  a practice followed in India but apparently coming under strain with the advent of new-age hospitals and overtreatment.        
	The new recommendations (see chart), which do not apply to a small group of women with unusual risk factors for breast cancer, reverse longstanding US guidelines and are aimed at reducing harm from overtreatment, according to the US Preventive Task Force.        
	While many women do not think a screening test can be harmful, medical experts say the risks are real. A test can trigger unnecessary further tests, like biopsies, that can create extreme anxiety. And mammograms can find cancers that grow so slowly that they never would be noticed in a womans lifetime, resulting in unnecessary treatment.         
	The American Cancer Society has challenged the new recommendations. But senior cancer specialists in India have sided with the task force, citing evidence of limited benefits from this breast cancer screening technique in women below 50.         
	Some doctors have said the debate is relevant to India where the breast cancer incidence appears to be rising. They estimate that about 100,000 new breast cancer cases are diagnosed each year and 30,000 women die each year.         
	Mammography is a technique that uses X-rays to examine the breasts which are compressed under a machine for uniform distribution of tissues which helps obtain sharp images.         
	Probably because of increased awareness about breast cancer, more women in India are also now opting for mammography, which costs between Rs 1,000 and Rs 1,200 in Calcutta.        
	Several women in their forties, especially mid-career professionals, go in for the test as part of their annual medical check-ups, a Calcutta-based hospital adminstrator said. quot;Mammography is becoming quite popular now as awareness of breast cancer spreads. Many women do it as a part of their annual health check-up. It is done in most of the major city hospitals, quot; he said.        
	But a doctor near Delhi said mammography was not yet quot;routine quot; in India. Others said some private hospitals do quot;gently persuade quot; women to take the test even when they were in their forties, although publicly most such establishments frown on below-50 mammograms. Charges of excessive tests as well as treatment are often levelled against some hospitals in India.        
	The US task force has cited over-diagnosis among potential harms. If the screening procedure detects a slow-growing cancer that would otherwise not have caused symptoms during a womans normal lifetime, she would be exposed without justification to the risks of treatment, including chemotherapy.         
	A Canadian study published in 2002 had indicated quot;clear excess death rates quot; among mammography screened women in the 40-to-49 age group during the first four years after diagnosis.         
	 quot;The medical evidence for lack of benefit of mammography in women below 50 has been crystal clear for long, quot; said Rajan Badwe, director of the Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, who was not associated with the US analysis.         
	The new US recommendations follow a large analysis of screening strategies, including cases in England and Sweden, that has shown that mammography in women between 50 and 74 helps reduces the breast cancer deaths much more than in women between 40 and 49. There is no evidence of mortality reducing benefits of mammography in women above 75 years.        
	The findings, which appear today in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, have political implications in the US where researchers worry the report will be interpreted as an effort by the Barack Obama administration to save money on healthcare costs.        
	The American Cancer Society has said although mammography has quot;limitations quot; in women in their forties, these limitations do not change the fact that quot;screening for mammography starting at age 40 saves lives quot;.        
	Badwe and his colleagues at TMH, Mumbai, have for more than a decade cited research studies suggesting that mammography has a significant effect on reducing the number of deaths after early detection only in women above 50.        
	 quot;The US is the only country in the world where women in their forties still get routine mammography screening, quot; Badwe said. quot;The availability of this technology may have contributed to its widespread promotion, quot; he said.        
	But some doctors caution there is not enough epidemiological data from India to determine the relevance of the new recommendation. quot;It is unfortunate, we dont really know the age range in which breast cancer incidence is highest in India, quot; said Sidharth Sahni, a breast cancer surgeon at the Artemis Health Institute near Delhi.        
	 quot;Besides, mammography is not a routine screening technique in India  even among affluent sections, quot; Sahni told The Telegraph . quot;We still need to build more awareness and introduce routine breast self examination, quot; he said.

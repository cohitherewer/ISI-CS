  - Producers and plexes resolve differences, new films next Friday        PRATIM D. GUPTA                                                  
	Calcutta, June 5: Bollywoods back after nine Fridays.        
	After 62 days of no-show, marathon meetings, starry kiss-and-make-ups, the United Producers and Distributors Forum (UPDF) and the national chains of multiplexes have decided India can watch new Hindi films again.         
	Before daybreak on Friday, after yet another lets-get-it-over-with meeting, the two warring parties shook hands.        
	At first it seemed only Big Cinemas had signed the dotted line with the UPDF, but the other national chains (PVR, Inox, Fame, Fun, Cinemax) confirmed they too had agreed to the new terms.         
	Deepak Asher, director of Inox and president of the Multiplex Association of India, said: Everyone has signed the papers. Both sides are happy and new films will start releasing from next Friday at all multiplexes.        
	The row was over the revenue-sharing percentage. Earlier the producer-plex ratio would be 50:50, 40:60, 30:70 and 25:75 (the producer gets 50 per cent of the revenues in Week One, 40 per cent in Week Two, 30 per cent in Week Three and 25 per cent in Week Four) for a star-powered film. The ratio could be 45:55, 35:65, 30:70 and 25:75 for a small film.        
	The producers wanted that all films have a 50:50 revenue ratio for the first four weeks. This is to protect the fraternity from the uncertainty faced every Thursday before a release, the UPDFs stand.         
	The multiplexes didnt agree and since they account for around two-third of the total revenue earned by a film and single screens alone can never bring in the numbers (Aa Dekhen Zara tried and failed), producers stopped releasing new films from April 4.         
	The revenue-sharing numbers were discussed and dissected in the eight weeks that followed. While the figures agreed upon would officially be issued in a joint statement on Monday, The Telegraphs sources say the new producer-plex ratio would be 50:50, 42.5:47.5, 37.5:63.5 and 30:70 in the first four weeks.         
	There is a rider: If the film does well  more than Rs 17.5 crore net collection across all multiplex chains  the producers would get 2.5 per cent extra in the first two weeks making the ratio 52.5:47.5 and 45:55. And if the film does badly  less than Rs 10 crore net collection the producers share would come down by 2.5 per cent in the second and third weeks making the ratio 40:60 and 35:65 in Weeks 2 and 3.         
	Therefore a Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi or a Ghajini will fall in the first category while a Drona or a Love Story 2050 will fall in the second category.         
	The flop-hit rider doesnt apply for smaller films like Mithya or Firaaq because under the revised agreement it is a prerequisite for the film to release for more than 500 screens.        
	In effect, the UPDF has agreed upon what the multiplexes were doing anyway  determining the producers share on the merit of the film. Only this time, the bargaining wont continue till the release date because the figures are on paper and the benchmarks have been ascertained.         
	Neither can a big producer now want an extra 5 per cent before handing over the prints to the multiplexes nor can the other side strangle a small film by lowering the revenue share.        
	Mukesh Bhatt, chairman of the UPDF, revealed that as many as 45 films got held up in the last nine Fridays, but multiplex officials were quick to point out that the releases were entirely hypothetical.         
	With the IPL happening, I am not sure how many of those films would have actually released. So the number is a mere speculation, said Shravan Shroff of Fame Cinemas.

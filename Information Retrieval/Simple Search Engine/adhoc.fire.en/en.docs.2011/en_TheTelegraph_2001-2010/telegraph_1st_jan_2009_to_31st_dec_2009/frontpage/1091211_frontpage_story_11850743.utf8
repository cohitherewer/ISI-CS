The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Study sees India roots in most Asians

	New Delhi, Dec. 10: The most detailed family tree of Asias diverse populations suggests that virtually all eastern and southeast Asian populations, including the Chinese, have their ancestral roots in India.        
	The tree, constructed by a consortium of Asian scientists, has shown that the most recent common ancestors of Asians arrived from Africa to India, then travelled southeast first, before branching northward to populate the rest of Asia.        
	The researchers from India and nine other Asian countries analysed variations in genetic sequences from 1,928 people representing 73 populations from across Asia. Their study indicates that all Asian populations branched out from a single primary wave of entry of humans into the Asian continent tens of thousands of years ago. The findings will appear in the journal Science tomorrow.        
	We now have a family tree that tells us how Asians are related to each other and to populations in other parts of the world, said Mitali Mukherjee, a team member at the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, New Delhi.        
	Earlier studies based on physical differences between Asian populations and less sophisticated biochemical tests had indicated that Asia was populated by two waves of human migrations.         
	The first wave out of Africa, which some scientists believe occurred about 70,000 years ago, brought people into India and southeast Asia. In the second wave, humans trudged across central Asia into northern and eastern Asia.        
	Our data point to a single wave into Asia, Edison Liu, executive director of the Genome Institute of Singapore, the coordinator of the study, told The Telegraph.        
	But a Calcutta scientist who was part of the consortium said the available data did not conclusively establish that all eastern Asian populations had roots in India.        
	Well need more data from populations from the Middle East and central Asia for definitive assertions about eastern Asian origins, said Partha Mazumder, a senior scientist at the Indian Statistical Institute, Calcutta.

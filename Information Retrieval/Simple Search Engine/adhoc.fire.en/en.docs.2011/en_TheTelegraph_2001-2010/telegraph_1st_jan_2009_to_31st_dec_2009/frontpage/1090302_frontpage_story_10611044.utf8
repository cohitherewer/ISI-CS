          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                            Clearing hurdles                                  
	Ranchi, March 1: The environment appraisal committee of the Union ministry of environment and forests today accepted that the coal industry needed fast green clearance to increase production and meet growing demands. But changes are needed in the environmental laws, it observed.        
	The 15-member committee, which attended an interactive session with the chiefs of coal companies from across the country at IICM here, asked the ministry of coal to approach the ministry of environment and forests to move the proposal for bringing in statutory changes.        
	Central Mine Planning amp; Design Institute Ltd (CMPDIL) director (technical) A.K. Debnath said that there was a consensus on removing the statutory hurdles for giving fast environmental clearance to the expansion plans of some 100 existing coal mines across the country, most of which are in Jharkhand.        
	Under the set guidelines, fresh environmental clearance has to be taken of existing mines if the coal companies want to expand them. We want cluster concept. There should be one clearance for various mines projects operating in a particular area, said a senior coal company official.         
	At the meets inaugural address, A. Balraj, the committee chairman, said the important role being played by coal in energy security of the country and stressed on the need for mitigating environmental damage because of coal mining.         
	He added that public sector units, whose operations are not solely guided by profit making, have to play important role in promoting environmentally benign mine design and operations.        
	CMPDI chairman and managing director A.K. Singh presented the work carried out by CIL and CMPDI in the field of environment and social uplift of community in the coalfields.         
	The meet is being attended by more than 15 members of the committee, chiefs of CMPDI and CCL and directors of CIL subsidiaries, including MCL, ECL and BCCL.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             Amartya Sen with Barkha Dutt at Nandan on Wednesday. Picture by Aranya Sen                                   
	Calcutta, Aug. 5: Who were denied justice more in Singur  farmers who lost their land or workers who lost potential jobs with the pullout of the Tata car factory? And, if reasoned public discussion is the basis for justice, what hopes for a society if people are bigoted and incapable of reasoning?         
	Amartya Sen had no reason to answer  or even face  such questions at the launch of his new book, The Idea of Justice, at the London School of Economics last month. In Calcutta, though, Singur and land acquisition or the recent electoral debacle of the Left in Bengal, attributed largely to the land question, had to find a place in a discussion that followed his Penguin Annual Lecture on Wednesday evening.         
	Barkha Dutt of NDTV, with whom Sen had the discussion after his lecture on Justice  and India, may have missed Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in the audience, especially because the venue, Nandan, is known to be a favourite with Bengals culture-loving chief minister.        
	He was said to have been keen to attend, but was forced to stay away by an annual party programme that assumed greater political significance this year because of the post-poll crisis of the CPM.         
	Sens answer could have pleased Bhattacharjee, but only partially. He iterated that the Tata factory could have gone a long way in reviving hopes for Bengals industrialisation and reducing its level of poverty. But he also said land acquisition should be the last resort, a point he had made earlier in a signed article in The Telegraph last September, and that investors should buy land from the market.        
	The Singur story, in his view, illustrates the need for a public debate on what is the way forward.         
	Between his lecture and the discussion emerged what Aveek Sarkar, Penguin India chairman and editor-in-chief of the ABP Group, had called the two Amartya Sens. While introducing Sen, he was unsure of what to say of the man without sounding trite and obvious.        
	 But he found his way to do that, introducing the two Sens  one a great academic and thinker and the other a concerned citizen of the world and a great humanist who offered roadmaps for elected governments and for the real world. He recalled the description of Sen as a sophisticated intellectual campaigner by Sunil Khilnani, the author of The Idea of India.         
	But he also set the tone for Sens lecture, recalling Kenneth Arrow and wondering how one would define injustices if one couldnt define justice.         
	Sen began by saying that though justice was a hugely appealing idea, the search for it could look hopeless like looking for a black cat in a dark room when the cat isnt there.         
	But a society has no escape from searching for justice. Philosophers and political theorists down the ages have done it in two ways. One way is to look for the perfectly just society and the transcendental institutionalism that can form the basis for this not less or not more, but absolutely just society.         
	Sens own approach to the question of justice is different. It is comparative rather than transcendental. He talked of the difference in his approach from that of John Rawls, author of A Theory of Justice. Rawls, he said, identified perfectly just institutions. But Sen argued that the way people lived in a society was influenced not just by institutions and laws but also by their behaviour, their actions, reactions and their movements. The question is one of the impact of institutions on peoples lives.         
	Transcendentalists wouldnt do anything about battling injustices until their world of perfectly just institutions came into existence. But Sen cited the historic campaigns against slavery, womens subjugation and other social evils by thinkers such as Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, Mary Wollstonecraft and Karl Marx to argue that the world cannot wait for the perfectly just society to campaign on such issues.         
	For him, life would be unbearable if you did nothing, socially or politically, until you knew what an ideal state was. Preventing manifest problems of injustice is more important than looking for a perfectly just society. It isnt a matter of only political philosophy, but also of political practice. And the institutions of niti (policies and principles) have to be submitted to the demands of nyaya (justice). Avoiding matsyanyaya, in which big fish devour the small fish, is a crucial part of justice.        
	Sen was concerned that in India, patent injustices such as child malnutrition, poor peoples lack of entitlement to basic medical education, primary health care or gender inequality were crowded out of political discourse and practice.         
	The answer  and that also is the road to justice  is to engage more and more people in public discussion.

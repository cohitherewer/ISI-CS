	New Delhi, July 10: A 20-year study in the US involving rhesus monkeys of Indian origin has shown that cutting calories slows ageing and reduces the risk of cancer, diabetes and heart disease.         
	The study by scientists at the National Primate Research Centre at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, also appears to corroborate suggestions by a team of scientists in Hyderabad about 12 years ago that eating less can delay ageing.         
	The Wisconsin team allowed a group of 38 rhesus monkeys to eat freely from a nutritional diet of protein and fat, and restricted calorie intake by 30 per cent for another group with an equal number of monkeys, maintaining them on a low diet for years.         
	The study results, published in the US journal Science today, suggest that calorie restriction delays the onset of certain age-related diseases and promotes survival in primate species.         
	The monkeys appear to have longer and healthier lives, said Ricki Colman, lead author of the study. Restricting calories reduced the risk of diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular diseases  which are sometimes seen in aged monkeys.         
	The incidence of both cancer and cardiovascular diseases in the calorie-restricted monkeys was 50 per cent lower than among monkeys allowed to feed without restrictions. The study also showed protection from diabetes.         
	The study on monkeys adds to mounting evidence for the idea that cutting calories increases longevity of mammals  an observation first made in rodents by Cornell University scientists in 1935. Many studies on rodents have replicated the findings since then. But the research at Wisconsin is among the longest observations of a primate species on calorie restriction.         
	The calorie-restricted monkeys which, Colman said, were all born in the Wisconsin Primate Centre but are of Indian origin, also appear to be biologically younger than the monkeys that consumed food without restrictions.         
	But Colman cautions that the calorie restriction strategy may not be ready as an option for humans yet.         
	Were still exploring the mechanisms of this process in a species closely related to humans, she said over the phone.         
	The experiments involved maintaining the monkeys on a low calorie diet for a significant part of their lifetime, she said. We restrict calories but do so in a very healthful manner through a highly nutritious diet.         
	Twenty years after the study started in 1989, the death rate from age-related diseases is three times lower among calorie-restricted monkeys  37 per cent of monkeys on the free diet had died, compared to only 13 per cent in the calorie-restricted group.         
	The scientists also found that regions of the brain responsible for functions such as memory and problem solving seem to be better preserved in monkeys that had been on calorie-restricted diets.        
	This is a completely new observation, said Richard Weindruch, professor of medicine at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, in a statement issued through the university.         
	In 1996, Kalluri Subba Rao, a biochemist at the University of Hyderabad had shown that slightly undernourished people have higher levels of activities of certain enzymes that act against the normal process of ageing.         
	I dont think theres any doubt now about whether dietary calorie restrictions can slow ageing... the unresolved questions are the mechanism for this process, Rao, who retired from the university and is now an emeritus elsewhere, said.         
	But how much longer the calorie-restricted monkeys live than the other monkeys would become clearer over time, Colman said. Rhesus monkeys have a lifespan of about 27 years and the oldest animal in the current study is 29 years old.

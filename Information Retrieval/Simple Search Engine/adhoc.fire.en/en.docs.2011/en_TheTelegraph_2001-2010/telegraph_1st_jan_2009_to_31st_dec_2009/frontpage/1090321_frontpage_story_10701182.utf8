	Bhubaneswar, March 20: Union home minister P. Chidambaram today asked the Orissa government to ensure peace and order in Kandhamal, especially keeping in mind the coming elections.        
	Its the responsibility of the state government to maintain peace during the polls, which I hope will be conducted peacefully in Orissa, he told reporters after reviewing the state security.        
	Orissa faces twin threats  from Maoists and communal conflict  the minister said, adding that the state had witnessed constant tension since the Christmas of 2007.         
	The longest period of conflict was after VHP leader Swami Laxmananda Saraswati and four of his associates were killed on the night of August 23 at the Jalespeta ashram. The strife that followed claimed 41 people, mostly Christians, and more than 25,000 people had to flee their homes.         
	We discussed what steps need to be taken and what more can be done. The government has asked for central paramilitary forces. We will try our best to provide more forces, Chidambaram said. He promised to provide two helicopters to use in the polls.        
	Chidambaram said todays review was a follow-up of the decisions taken at the chief ministers conference on January 6 and 7 on internal security and the Maoist menace. On its part, the Orissa government assured the Centre about the measures it had taken on internal security.         
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik, who attended the review meeting, said the state had initiated moves to fill up vacancies in the police force, modernise the force to counter rebel threat and upgrade coastal security.         
	He said the state was raising a special commando force to tackle extreme situations. The state also sought the Chidambarams intervention to raise more Indian Reserve Battalion and augment grants under police modernisation scheme, as well as inclusion of five districts under the security-related expenditure reimbursement scheme.         
	We also asked for more central paramilitary forces, Naveen added.        
	The Union home minister also assured the state that the government was looking at upgrading training facilities as well. As a part of the improvement, the Centre has sanctioned five new marine police stations, of which, two have been established.        
	Later, director-general of police M.M. Praharaj said the state had sought 50 companies of central paramilitary forces over and above 20 companies already deployed in Kandhamal.         
	Earlier, the Union home ministry had agreed to provide only 10 companies of central paramilitary forces, he said.

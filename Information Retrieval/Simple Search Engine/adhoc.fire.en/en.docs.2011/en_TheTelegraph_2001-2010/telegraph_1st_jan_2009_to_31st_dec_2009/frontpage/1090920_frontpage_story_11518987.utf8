  - Files set ablaze at Imphal hospital administrative block q Militants fire lethod bombs        OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Imphal, Sept. 19: Students set fire to two government schools in Thoubal district while unidentified persons set ablaze a room of the Regional Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) in Imphal city in three separate incidents last night.        
	Sources said students set on fire the Kakching Khunou Govt High School at 9.30pm last night using petrol-soaked clothes and coarse materials.        
	The arsonists broke open the door of the principals room and threw in petrol-soaked materials before setting them on fire.        
	The fire destroyed a large number of chairs, tables, cabinets and files.         
	Ten computer sets kept in the staff room, near the principals room, were also destroyed.        
	Intervention by the local residents saved the library room.        
	Sources said the school was having regular classes though most of the schools in the district were suspended following the class boycott call by three student organisations  the All Manipur Students Union, Manipuri Students Federation and Manipur University Students Union.        
	The class boycott was in support of the Apunba Lup-spearheaded campaign to oust chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh in the wake of the July 23 firing incident in Imphal, in which a pregnant woman, Rabina Devi, and former militant Ch. Sanjit were killed.        
	In another incident, students set ablaze the office of Wangjing Higher Secondary School late last night. Some furniture and files were destroyed in the arson.        
	In the third incident, a fire damaged most of the files kept in the head clerks office in the administrative block of RIMS, shortly after midnight. The office of RIMS director L. Fimate is located in this block. Two fire tenders doused the fire at 2.30am.        
	Medical superintendent of the institute Y. Mohen Singh told the police that suspended employees could be behind the arson.        
	He said 16 employees were suspended in April this year for misappropriation of funds.        
	We suspect that the suspended employees are behind the arson. Most of the files kept at the head clerks office were damaged in the fire. The motive was to destroy the records and the files, Mohen Singh said.        
	In a related development, the Congress Legislature Party meeting presided by chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh today decided that every MLA should campaign in their constituencies to restore the academic atmosphere in the valley districts.        
	The academic scenario was discussed seriously. We agreed to campaign in our respective areas for normalisation of the situation, a member of the CLP said.        
	The burning of the two government schools came shortly before the Apunba Lup sponsored 60-hour general strike began at midnight yesterday.        
	The Apunba Lup called the general strike as a part of its agitation demanding the resignation of Ibobi Singh and punishment for the police commandos responsible for the death of the two persons in the July 23 firing incident.        
	The general strike had little impact on the first day in and around Imphal city. Most of the shops were open and transport services continued. There was no report of any violence.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                              
	Patna, Dec. 10: Bihar police unearthed four illegal gun factories set up in the notorious Munger district to supply arms to Maoists in Jharkhand today, 48 hours before fourth phase of voting is to be held in the ongoing Assembly polls.         
	The police arrested five gun mechanics from the site at isolated Bardai village in Ganga diara in Munger, 190km from here, and seized two 9mm pistols, 17 country-made guns, besides 30 rounds of live cartridges, in the raids conducted after the interrogation of two hardcore Maoist leaders, Kundan and Chetlal.         
	Wanted by both Bihar and Jharkhand for the last two years, the rebel leaders were nabbed in Jamalpur by the Munger police who were reluctant to reveal the exact date of the duos arrest.         
	Chetlal is a veteran guerrilla and head of the CPI(Maoists)s clandestine arms procurement and supply committee. Kundan is his accomplice and also a guerrilla trained in armed warfare, said the Munger SP, M. Sunil Nayak.        
	Kundan, he added, was from Chatra district of Jharkhand, while Chetlal was from Khadagpur in Munger district.         
	The arrested gun mechanics, who have revealed they learnt their craft at a Maoist training camp in a forest near Bokaro, were identified as Md Saddam, the 25-year-old ring leader, and Tanvir, Md Shakeer, Md Parvez and Md Heera, all of whom are below 18.        
	According to the police, during interrogation, Chetlal and Kundan had provided vital information on the mode of Maoist operations in Jharkhand and bordering areas in Bihar.        
	They confessed they had smuggled several machine guns from insurgency-hit Nagaland for supply to Maoist guerrillas in Jharkhand. Their interrogation is in progress. We will get to know more later, said Nayak.        
	Security forces were continuing their search in Bardai village, not ruling out the possibility of stumbling upon more such arms factories.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Stars to shine on poll pitch
                                                                                                           Stars to shine on poll pitch
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Patna, March 6: The Election Commission has decided to engage film stars for educating voters about the importance of the right to vote and motivate them for exercising that right, chief election commissioner N. Gopalaswami announced here today.         
	We are working on the modalities of using film stars to popularise the importance of casting votes, Gopalaswami said.        
	You will see the stars shining in the electoral battle field this time.         
	Asked if the EC would engage Amitabh Bachchan or Shah Rukh Khan, Gopalaswami said: I will not name any star as of now. But you will surely see the stars dazzling around you this time.         
	Gopalaswami, who arrived here today for a two-day review mission, had election commissioners Navin Chawla and S.Y. Qureshi for company.         
	But he dismissed questions about whether the differences between him and Chawla persisted, triggered off by the fact that they arrived in different planes. Blame the UP government for sending us in two different planes. There is no difference among us. The Election Commission is duty-bound to hold free, fair and transparent polls, for which we are together, he said.         
	Forget about the fact that we landed separately. We will return together in the same flight, Chawla chipped in.        
	On BJPs partisan allegation, Chawla said: We are busy preparing to hold the first phase of polls in a fair and transparent manner together. You can see we are together as a team before you.         
	Gopalaswami also asked the state government to furnish a list of officers imported from other states and deployed in various districts and names of those transferred only a few days prior to the announcement of the polls and introduction of the model code of conduct. He also sought the lists of complaints from certain political parties about the misuse of state power in deploying officials.         
	Gopalaswami said that the Election Commission would consider the demand of certain parties not to allow the state government to field newly appointed contract teachers on poll duty.         
	He said that the commission would keep a close watch on criminal-turned-politicians, who had been released on bail recently in the state. Certain political parties have expressed their fear about these people, he said.

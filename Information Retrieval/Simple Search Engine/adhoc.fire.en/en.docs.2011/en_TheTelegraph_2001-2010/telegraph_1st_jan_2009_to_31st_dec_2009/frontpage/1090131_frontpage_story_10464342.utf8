	London, Jan. 30: Angelina Jolie wore her dress back to front at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, prompting fierce debate in the fashion world over whether the move was deliberate.         
	The actress wore a striking ball gown from designer Max Azrias spring collection to the event in Los Angeles on Sunday.         
	The 560 cornflower blue dress had kimono-style sleeves and waistline and a plunging neckline. But pictured at the awards, Jolies chest was completely covered while the tatoos adorning her back were clearly exposed.         
	Her stylist Jen Rade later confirmed to Usmagazine.com that she wore the dress backwards deliberately to make it more blouson and to show off her body art.         
	When Jolie discussed the garment in a red carpet interview with TV show E! on Sunday, she said: I just like to be comfortable, I see what comfortable options are out there.         
	Some leading fashion experts apparently failed to spot the dress was the wrong way round.         
	A Los Angeles Times critic wrote: Jolie is one of the few celebrities who has developed a signature red carpet look: drapey, goddess-like dresses that show off her tattooed shoulders, natural hair, minimal make-up and jewellery.        
	Some have criticised the look as dowdy, but I would call it self-aware.         
	That alone sets her apart from the starlet pack, giving her integrity as an actress and mother, instead of just a mannequin.                     THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

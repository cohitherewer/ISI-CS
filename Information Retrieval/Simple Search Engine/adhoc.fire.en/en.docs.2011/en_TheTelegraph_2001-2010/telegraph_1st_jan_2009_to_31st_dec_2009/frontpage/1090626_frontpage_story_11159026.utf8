          AMIT GUPTA                               
	Ranchi, June 25: The Union Cabinet secretary and a battery of senior officials from New Delhi will be visiting Jharkhand on Sunday to review ongoing development programmes and the prevailing law and order situation in the backdrop of an anti-Maoist operation in neighbouring Bengal.        
	Cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrashekhar, who last visited the state in 2007, was being accompanied by a host of Union government officials, including secretaries of seven to eight departments, to hold day-long meeting the next day on June 29, probably at Indian Institute of Coal Management (IICM).         
	Cabinet co-ordination secretary P.K. Jajoria, who received a communiqu on Chandrashekhars visit today, maintained a decision was yet to be taken on who all would represent the state_it could either be limited to departmental secretaries and senior police officials or be extended to deputy commissioners and district superintendents of police.         
	State government sources said the Union cabinet secretariat, that also looked at internal security, would review the problem of Naxalism that had gained fresh momentum in spite of the imposition of presidents rule about six month back.         
	Chandrashekhar will also review ongoing central schemes whose implementation in Jharkhand has been dismal. Schemes like the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM), Rajiv Gandhi Gramin Vidyutikaran Yojana (RGGVY), Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) and, most importantly, progress in the special programmes supposed to have been initiated in the 10 districts worst affected by Naxalism will come under his scanner.         
	The cabinet secretary would also review progress in road and infrastructure projects and issues related to tribal welfare.        
	The achievement in the sadak yojana has been so poor that the Governor has now stopped execution of fresh projects pending completion of the over 600 rural road projects launched between 2001 to 2007.         
	The rural electrification programme has also made little progress with only about 12,000 among 32,000 villages electrified so far. The target is 2012.

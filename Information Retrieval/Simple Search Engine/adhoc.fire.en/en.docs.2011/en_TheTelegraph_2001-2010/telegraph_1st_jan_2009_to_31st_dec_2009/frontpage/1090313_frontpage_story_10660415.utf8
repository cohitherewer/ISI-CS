          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Naveen leaves the House after trust vote. (PTI)                                  
	Bhubaneswar, March 12: All eyes are now glued to the Raj Bhavan after Congress and BJP leaders met Governor M.C. Bhandare yesterday and accused chief minister Naveen Patnaik of tweaking the law and winning the trust vote.        
	At the meet, the parties sought the imposition of Presidents rule in Orissa, leading to speculation that the governor may order a fresh vote or, indeed, recommend the imposition of Presidents rule.        
	However, Raj Bhavan sources are tight-lipped regarding the matter, even as the governor summoned the Speaker to discuss the allegation. Speaker Kishor Kumar Mohanty, while talking to reporters, confirmed that he was summoned by the governor yesterday. I briefed him, said Mohanty. Raj Bhavan sources said Bhandare reviewed all House documents and video and verified details with the Speaker regarding the trust vote where the BJD-led government won.         
	Yesterday, groups from both the Congress and the BJP met the governor separately to lodge their protest and demanded the dismissal of the government.         
	The deputy leader of the state Congress, Narasingha Mishra, alleged the Speaker adopted a voice vote route and did not go for division of votes that is mandatory for a trust motion, even as he (Mishra) and his party legislators demanded it. The leaders also protested that his motion was put to voice vote without conducting a debate on the trust motion. An argument also erupted regarding violation of code of conduct after which the Opposition Congress demanded the disqualification of a few BJP legislators, who had quit the party. Talking to the media today, Mishra labelled yesterdays proceedings as the blackest day in Orissas history in which both the Constitution and Assembly rules were violated.        
	Orissa Pradesh Congress Committee president K.P. Singhdeo, who led the Congress delegation, accused the government of winning the vote without going in for any voting process. Slips were not issued to members, nor were voting machines used, he alleged. Speaker Mohanty, however, stressed that the adoption of voice vote was neither illegal nor unconstitutional. He added that the Opposition had not made any demand for a division later.         
	BJP legislature party leader Biswabhusan Harichandan, however, stressed that despite his repeated demand for a division, the motion moved by Naveen was pushed through and the Speaker announced that it was adopted (by voice vote).                     
	Naveen also added today that the Opposition opposed the debate arguing that it would violate the model code of conduct and that when the motion was put to vote, nobody sought a division. Speaker, Mohanty also added that the motion was adopted by a majority of votes.        
	BJD secretary general Damodar Rout claimed the government had the support of 81 members.        
	After the motion, the Congress and BJP staged a walkout, leaving behind 81 members, including the Speaker. Deputy Speaker Prahallad Dora (of BJP), former BJP members Sananda Marandi and Brundaban Majhi, who left the party to join Samruddha Odisha, did not walk out.        
	Naveen was required to show the support of at least 74 members to prove his partys majority in the 147-member House. While his party (BJD) has 61 members, four legislators of the JMM, two MLAs from the NCP and one from the CPI and the CPM, as well as seven Independents, had pledged their support to the BJD government.         
	Besides, three BJP legislators (Dhaneswar Majhi, Mahesh Sahoo and Brundaban Majhi) had quit the party and announced their decision to join the BJD. The Speaker also rejected two petitions filed by the BJP for the disqualification of those MLAs.

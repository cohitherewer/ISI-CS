	Ranchi, June 15: Jharkhand seems to be headed for a constitutional deadlock with six months of Presidents rule coming to an end on July 19 even as the state Assembly continues to be in suspended animation.        
	The crux of the debate centres around Article 174(1) of the Constitution that essentially rules that consecutive assembly sessions cannot be held more than six months apart.        
	The last session of the Assembly was held on December 22. Hence, in Jharkhand either the Assembly has to be dissolved or a new government formed by June 22.        
	Legal experts pointed out that a violation of the provisions of Article 174(1) meant the governance of the state could not be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution within the meaning of Article 356(1).        
	Such an issue was thrown up in Gujarat after the 2002 riots. The governor had dissolved the House on the advice of chief minister Narendra Modi on July 19. The last sitting of the dissolved House was held on April 3, 2002.         
	Immediately after the dissolution, the Election Commission, while acknowledging that Article 174(1) was applicable to a dissolved Assembly, declared it was unable to conduct elections before October 3, 2002, the last date of the six-month deadline.        
	The Election Commission referred the issue to the Supreme Court after the BJP cried foul. And the apex court ruled that Article 174(1) of the Constitution did not apply to a dissolved Assembly.        
	In Jharkhand, however, the issue was different as the Assembly was in suspended animation with UPA partners were clamouring to form an alternative government.        
	Constitutional expert and former Lok Sabha secretary general Subhash Kashyap iterated Article 174 (1) applied to a House in suspended animation. Referring to the Gujarat case, he pointed out that the Supreme Court ruling said the six- month period, as stipulated in Article 174 (1), was not mandatory between the last sitting of the dissolved House and the first session of the new House which was to be constituted after holding elections.         
	But in Jharkhand the suspended House is still the same House. So, the six-month period is mandatory, he explained.                                            
	According to Kashyap, the Centre had three options. First, it could dissolve the House before June 22 and pave the way for fresh elections. Second, it could revive the Assembly after somebody stakes claim to the form an alternative government. And the third option is that the Centre amend Article 174 to save it from embarrassment, he pointed out.         
	Former advocate-general Anil Sinha agreed with Kashyap. In Jharkhand the House is under suspended animation. So, Article 174 is very much applicable, he maintained.         
	Noted lawyer and senior BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad, however, disagreed. How can the functions of a House and the presidents rule go hand in hand, he asked.        
	So far, Raj Bhavan has been silent on this question. Governor Syed Sibtey Razi is camping in New Delhi for the last five days amidst reports of an impending Governors reshuffle. Yes, we have not yet discussed this issue, admitted a source in Raj Bhavan.                                 
	What is Article 174        
	The Governor shall from time to time summon the House or each House of the Legislature of the State to meet at such time and place as he thinks fit, but six months shall not intervene between its last sitting in one session and the date appointed for its first sitting in the next session.

  - Scientists solve 88-year-old locust mystery          G.S. MUDUR                                                     The two avatars: Green signals the benign  phase, and brown the crop-ravaging one        
	New Delhi, Jan. 29: Scientists have unravelled the mechanism that turns harmless solitary desert locusts into gregarious crop-ravaging swarms, solving an 88-year-old Jekyll-and-Hyde mystery.         
	A team of British and Australian scientists has shown that a single brain chemical called serotonin is responsible for the dramatic change in behaviour that can turn locusts into devastating pests capable of wiping out vast areas of vegetation overnight.         
	Swarms of desert locusts have often struck cultivated crops and vegetation across North Africa, West Asia, China, and western parts of the Indian subcontinent. Billions of locusts make up a typical swarm which can extend across several kilometres.         
	Locusts start out solitary creatures, content at being alone, but undergo an extreme transformation in appearance and behaviour that makes them seek the company of other locusts and cluster into swarms.         
	Now, in a series of laboratory experiments, researchers in Cambridge, Oxford and Sydney have shown that an increase in levels of serotonin drives this change  from mutual aversion to swarm-formation and gregarious behaviour.        
	We have a solitary and lonely creature. But just give it a little serotonin, and they go join a gang, said Malcolm Burrows, a team member from the University of Cambridge. The findings will appear on Friday in the journal Science.        
	Until 1921, entomologists had thought that the solitary and gregarious locusts were separate species because of differences in appearance and behaviour. But observations over the decades have suggested that it is crowding that triggers the change in locusts behaviour. The insects stay close to one another, change colour, and develop large muscles for long flights as members of swarms.        
	The new study has shown that gregarious locusts had three times more serotonin in specific parts of their nervous systems.         
	Until now, while we knew the stimuli that cause locusts amazing Jekyll and Hyde-style transformation, nobody had been able to identify the changes in the nervous system that turn anti-social locusts into monstrous swarms, said Michael Anstey at the University of Oxford.        
	Entomologists with Indias Locust Warning Organisation (LWO), a network of surveillance stations in western India, have often encountered swarms of locusts flying in from western Asia into Rajasthan and Gujarat.        
	LWO scientists had battled a small locust flare-up in 2007 in Jaisalmer and Jodhpur districts and in Bikaner, Jaisalmer and Jodhpur in 2005. In 1993, they had to use aircraft to shower locust-killing chemicals across western Rajasthan.        
	Locust control is tough -- we get a chance to strike them only in the night, said a senior scientist at the Plant Protection and Quarantine divion of the Ministry of Agriculture. They fly through the day and rest on vegetation during the night, he said.        
	If we dont act against the locusts during the night, they will eat up all the vegetation, and the next morning the swarm begins flying towards its next target, the scientist who requested not to be named told The Telegraph.        
	Researchers believe the new study by the British-Australian team may lead to new strategies to control locusts. One possible option would be to use a chemical that acts against serotonin which could prevent them from forming swarms.

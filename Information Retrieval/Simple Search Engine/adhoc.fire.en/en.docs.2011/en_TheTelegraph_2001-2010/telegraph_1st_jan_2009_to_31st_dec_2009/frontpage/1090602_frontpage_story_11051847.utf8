The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Dowry demon? Just hang him
                                                                                                           Dowry demon? Just hang him
  - Those who burn brides deserve to be given death: Supreme Court        OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                            Law to rescue                                        
	New Delhi, June 1: A Supreme Court judge who once said the corrupt should be hanged from the nearest lamppost created another flutter today when he told a life convict that people who burn young women over dowry deserved nothing less than death.        
	You poured kerosene over a young woman and set her on fire. You have got life (sentence)? You should have got death, Justice Markandey Katju thundered at Prem Kumar Gulati from Bhiwani, Haryana.        
	Gulati, in his mid-fifties, had been convicted by a lower court and the high court for burning his younger brothers 28-year-old wife Rajni on December 9, 2003.        
	In her dying declaration before a judicial magistrate, Rajni blamed her husband Mahender, then 31, her brother-in-law and his wife, Bimla, then 46, for pouring kerosene on her and setting her on fire.        
	Since their marriage in January 1995, Rajni and Mahender also used to frequently squabble over his alleged illicit relations with Bimla. He also beat her when drunk.         
	Although one of Rajnis daughters, Kumari Manshu, 8, who was present in the house, claimed it was an accident, a trial court jailed all three for life in April 2006. Bimla has since passed away.        
	Rajnis father Agyapal, who identified her body, claimed that his daughter was being continuously harassed for dowry. He said she once left her in-laws house in Jamalpur village but returned after the village panchayat intervened.        
	He also said his daughter had dropped a divorce case against Mahender after he apologised.         
	Today, when Gulatis lawyer Jasbir Malik argued for bail, Katju lost his cool.        
	Young women are being burnt to death. Is this the behaviour of civilised people? This is the behaviour of barbarians, junglees, he said. These things are happening on a large scale these days. This will stop only if some people are hanged.        
	A couple of years ago, the judge, while hearing a corruption case, had observed that the only panacea to rid the country of corrupt elements was to hang a few of them from the nearest lamppost.

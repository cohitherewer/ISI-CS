The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Maoists kill at will, govt a spectator 
                                                                                                           Maoists kill at will, govt a spectator 
          OUR BUREAU                      A deserted CPM local committee office in Dharampur                          
	June 14: Maoists used as cover a vigilante procession from Lalgarh and engaged CPM activists in a gun battle that killed at least three people, staining in blood the Bengal governments hands-off policy in the liberated belt.        
	The march by those protesting police atrocities had started from Lalgarh, large parts of which have been out of bounds for police since late last year, on Thursday and covered 11km to Dharampur in West Midnapore by Saturday afternoon when the killings occurred. Dharampur is a CPM stronghold on the outskirts of Lalgarh.        
	However, in keeping with the governments reluctance to enforce the law and risk a backlash, the police stood by as the procession crossed village after village, trailed by a band of armed men suspected to be Maoist guerrillas.        
	The government has been treating potential flashpoint issues with kid gloves since the March 14 firing in Nandigram that made the land controversy a national issue. However, caution gave way to excesses late last year when Maoists exploded a bomb on the chief ministers route in Salboni in West Midnapore.        
	The police torture of teenagers in a crackdown had triggered a backlash that was exploited by the Maoists to carve out a liberated zone. The government, wary of bloodshed in the run-up to the elections, played along and left the area to the guerrillas mercy. So eager was the government to dodge any difficult decision that it accepted the protesters conditions to hold polls.        
	Last night, the CPM paid a price for the governments inability to act  in an almost identical replay of the events in Khejuri where the administration reduced itself to a spectator while the Trinamul Congress targeted CPM supporters. ( )        
	The organiser of the procession  the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities  denied any Maoist hand and blamed CPM goons.        
	Sources who refused to be named for fear of retribution said the 700-strong procession marched towards Dharampur yesterday afternoon. CPM activists opened fire and shot arrows to block the procession that had apparently put at its head women, forced to join in from villages on the way.        
	The marchers then retreated and Maoists, who were at the rear, stepped forward and opened fire, the sources said.         
	The guns fell silent by 6pm but firing resumed at 3am today, apparently after the Maoists returned with reinforcements. Around 10 this morning, the bodies of Asit Samanta, Prabir Mahato and Keshab Manna were found. The three  in their 30s  are said to be CPM supporters.        
	After the battle was over, the administration imposed prohibitory orders which few believe the police can enforce, given the way the government has let matters come to a head over the past few months.        
	Dharampur has a police camp 500 metres from where the shootout took place, but the 20-odd policemen did not venture out. Police reinforcements could enter the village only at 5pm today  over 24 hours after the shootout started. A CRPF team has also headed to the village.        
	One reason for the delay was the fear of mines on the way but the bigger impediment was the depth of the administrations isolation from the ground.        
	The administration tonight withdrew a police camp at Koima, 10km from Lalgarh police station. One reason could be the 90-odd personnel are being called to join efforts to flush out Maoists if the government gives the go-ahead. Or the camp could have run out of provisions, sources said.        
	Till this evening, no senior official in Calcutta was either able to or willing to give details on the attack. Inspector-general of police (western range) Kuldiep Singh would only confirm the three deaths. We are investigating, he said.        
	This evening, chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said: I am yet to know the details. I have heard about the incident but could not make enquiries because of preoccupation with Aila relief and todays all-party meeting.

          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                               
	Ranchi, Dec. 6: Realising that it would not be possible to reach the magic figure of 41 in the state Assembly without some outside help, both BJP and Congress today ended campaign for the third phase of elections by softening their stance towards Shibu Soren and his Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM).        
	JVM leader, Congress ally and former chief minister Babulal Marandi, who has made it his agenda to replace Soren in state politics, too refrained from making any acerbic remarks against Guruji.        
	Four of the 11 seats going to polls on December 8 are in Sorens stronghold, Santhal Pargana, and two of them  Dumka and Jama  have Sorens son Hemant and daughter-in-law Sita in the fray, respectively.        
	According to political observers, the change in stand of both national parties follows reports that they would not be able to bag 41 seats in the 81-member House on their own steam. Also, the JMM, which initially was expected to come a cropper, seems to be holding its own and is expected to win a few seats, thereby putting Soren in the kingmakers seat.         
	When asked about a post-poll alliance with JMM, Union minister of state for home Ajay Maken replied that it would be decided by the Congress-JVM alliance after the elections.        
	Though BJP state president Raghubar Das too refused to admit that his party would have any truck with the JMM, the fact that the party fielded a weak candidate like Manoj Kumar Singh against Sita, instead of sitting MLA Sunil Soren, spoke volumes about its strategy as far as JMM was concerned.        
	Both parties will no longer be able to criticise Soren after their poor performance in the last two phases, said JMM central organising secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya.         
	Among the seats going to polls in the third phase, JMM holds two  Sikaripara and Chandankiyari. BJP has four seats  Jama, Jamua, Dhanwar and Bermo. While Congress has Bokaro and Hazaribagh, Independents have two, Dumka and Jarmundi.         
	However, though he may hold the key to who would form the next government, the going will be tough for Soren in Dumka. The seat has been former deputy chief minister Stephen Marandis since 1980. Initially with the JMM, Marandi won it last time as an Independent and is now in the fray as a Congress nominee.        
	Sita is contesting from Jama, earlier represented by Shibu Soren himself and Sitas late husband Durga. The BJP wrested the seat in 2005 from Durga.         
	Party nominee and former agriculture minister Nalin Soren is trying his luck for the fourth time from Sikaripara. As the area borders Bengal, the Trinamool Congress is trying to get a foothold. Nalin thus faces a tough contest from Munni Hansda of Trinamool.        
	Other than the Soren factor, parties have also gone quiet on the corruption issue after Madhu Kodas arrest.         
	BJPs Das said political stability had emerged the biggest poll plank for the third phase. The issue has really caught the fancy of voters as they have realised that political instability is the root of all the ills like corruption, poverty and illiteracy plaguing the state, he said. Incidentally, Rahul Gandhi, while campaigning a couple of days ago, avoided raking up either the Koda or rebel issues.         
	In the third phase, the battle to watch is in Bokaro where Congress is locked in a friendly contest with JVM. Marandi has fielded old warhorse Samresh Singh, while the Congress has renominated sitting legislator Izrail Ansari.                                
	Dhanwar is also ready for a direct contest between BJP and CPI(ML). The CPI (ML) is also struggling to hold its forte in Bagodar against RJD state chief Gautam Sagar Rana. In Hazaribagh, former external affairs minister Yashwant Sinha is burning the midnight oil to ensure victory of BJP nominee Dev Dayal against sitting Congress MLA Saurabh Narayan Singh.

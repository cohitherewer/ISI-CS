          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                   (From top) Amar Singh, Jayaprada, Azam Khan: Infighting                          
	Lucknow, May 8: Amar Singh today renewed his threat to quit the Samajwadi fold after simmering tensions with Azam Khan spilled on to the streets of Rampur with a mob smashing cars belonging to party candidate Jayapradas cavalcade.         
	Party general secretary Amar has been at loggerheads with senior colleague Khan over the invitation extended to Kalyan Singh to campaign for Samajwadi candidates.         
	Khan, the most recognisable Muslim face of the party, is also opposed to Jayapradas candidature from Rampur, his hometown from where the former actress won in 2004.        
	The clashes began around 10am when a group of people attacked the convoy of Abu Azmi, the Samajwadi strongman from Mumbai who is campaigning for Jayaprada in Rampur, a former princely state 400km from Lucknow.         
	The mob focused its attack on the four SUVs of Azmi, who claimed he was hit with a stone and two of his men injured. Amars flock retaliated, leading to a pitched battle.         
	We were campaigning for Jayaprada. It was a kind of a roadshow. Some youngsters came and told us they would be voting against Jayaprada. I was not provoked. But after some time they began hurling stones at my car, said Azmi.        
	Azmi, who was instrumental in bringing actor Sanjay Dutt into the party, accused Khan of engineering the attack. An FIR has been lodged against unnamed persons.        
	Amar requested Azmi to campaign for Jayaprada last week after Khan openly exhorted people to defeat her. This intensified hostilities, with Khan alleging that mafia leaders had been brought in from Mumbai to justify Kalyans friendship with the party.         
	Amar informed Samajwadi chief Mulayam Singh Yadav about the attack and blamed Khan for it. I will decide over continuing in the party after the end of the final phase of polls. I know if I want to be in the Samajwadi Party I will have to keep Azam Khan happy, Amar said.        
	Azam Khan is a favourite of Mulayam Singhji. In spite of his (Khan) intolerable utterances against me, I was being asked to keep silent, he added.         
	I am impatiently waiting for the moment when Mr Khan will insult me by hurling a shoe at me.... If it comes, I would first decorate this precious gift and then place it in a museum, said Amar, who had last month spoken of quitting the party only to retract the statement later.        
	Mulayam said in Lucknow the party would take disciplinary action against Khan after the polls.        
	Khan alleged Amar was trying to kill him. He has been openly threatening me. He has brought in hundreds of anti-socials and unleashed them in Rampur. They have threatened to kill me. I am scared. Now to scare me more, he is trying to trap me in cases, he said.         
	These are the people who are giving a clean chit to Kalyan Singh who, I still hold, is responsible for the Babri demolition, Khan said.         
	Caught in the crossfire is Jayaprada, who won in 2004 largely with Khans help. She is now telling voters that whatever happens, she will never leave Rampur.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | City goes to Chennai
                                                                                                           City goes to Chennai
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Sept. 9: What Chennai thought up yesterday, Calcutta is doing today  undeclared, out of sheer necessity.        
	Investors in search of land in Bengal have been trying out a formula finetuned in the southern city in the early eighties, its acceptability gaining ground in the wake of the collapse of the Singur model and when the risks of the Gaffar model became apparent.        
	The Chennai model, in realty parlance, is the zero-friction formula that keeps all parties happy.        
	Anyone setting up a project in Chennai knows that if Rs 10 is being spent to buy political peace, sections associated with those in power, whichever party they may belong to, get roughly Rs 6 and the principal Opposition gets around Rs 4, said a Calcutta-based businessman with associates in the southern city.        
	Calcutta had seen its first experiment with on-ground political coalition for land acquisition by the Gautam Deb-led Hidco for Rajarhat Megacity. The inclusive model there involved giving Trinamul Congress leaders in Rajarhat key posts in land procurement committees and allowing them to appoint hands in the suppliers syndicates.        
	But what happens when the government or a government agency is not directly involved?        
	It is very clear now that the government will not lift a finger to help in land acquisition, after burning its hands over Singur and Kolkata Link (the scrapped IT township project), said a businessman with projects in Rajarhat.        
	So, the only way out for private developers is to take a pragmatic two-pronged approach of over-compensating landlosers and keeping the two principal political forces happy on the ground, he added.        
	Enter, the Chennai model, marking the birth of realpolitik for business in Bengal. The balancing act of keeping both sides happy must be replicated in a defined manner on the ground for business projects to enjoy a smooth passage in Bengal, said a chamber of commerce veteran.        
	Land acquisition is not a major part of the project cost for any big business, especially in this part of the world where land rates are still low. So, business ventures must learn to pay landlosers above the prevailing market rate to minimise chances of protests and keep the CPM and Trinamul happy so that they either facilitate the process or at least do not oppose it, said an industrialist.        
	In Tamil Nadu itself, local sources said, the Chennai model is no longer as apparent as it used to be when it debuted in the early eighties.        
	 Decisions to raise bus fares and lift prohibition then had attracted charges that both the ruling party and the Opposition were handled well by those who stood to benefit from the decisions.        
	However, with the rivalry between the current principal opponents M. Karunanidhi and Jayalalithaa turning bitter and personal, the scope for such arrangements has narrowed, sources in Chennai claimed.

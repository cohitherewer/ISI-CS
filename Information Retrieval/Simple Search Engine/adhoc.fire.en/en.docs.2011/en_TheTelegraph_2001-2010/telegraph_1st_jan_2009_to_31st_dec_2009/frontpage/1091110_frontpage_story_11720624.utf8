          AMIT GUPTA                               
	Ranchi, Nov. 9: Investigating agencies are now focussing on mining leases awarded during Madhu Kodas tenure as chief minister of Jharkhand in their effort to unravel various sources of his allegedly ill-gotten wealth, estimated to be around Rs 2,000 crore.        
	Koda, who was released from hospital yesterday, has now been asked to appear before the Enforcement Directorate on November 15  the ninth anniversary of Jharkhand attaining statehood  when he is likely to be questioned on his alleged business interests and investments in illegal money laundering rackets.        
	Today, according to additional director (investigation) Ajit Kumar Srivastava, the IT department interrogated former district mining officer of West Singhbhum R.N. Prasad along with key associates of Koda, namely Bhim Singh, Arun Shrivastava and Devendra Mukhiya, a Delhi-based fixer, who was so far evading questioning.         
	Keeping the focus on mining leases, awarded to companies interested in setting up projects in the state, IT officials have had long meetings with state mines director B. B. Singh to understand the official procedure involved in allotting mining leases.        
	The state mines and geology department is also preparing a list of mines allotted during the tenure of Koda, first as mines minister and then chief minister. Yes, we are preparing a list of mines allotted during Kodas regime, admitted Singh.         
	 According to IT sources, Koda and his associates concentrated on allotment of virgin leases for which they werent required to put out public notifications in newspapers inviting proposals.         
	The IT department now claims it was aware of the whereabouts of Vinod Sinha and Sanjay Choudhary, the two key associates of Koda who have been evading questioning ever since the IT operations began in October.         
	Now, the department has set November 11 for their questioning, failing which, officials hinted, they would be brought in using legal means.         
	Srivastava said they did not question Koda today as he requested a days rest on health grounds. We will start interrogating Koda from tomorrow (November 10), he said.        
	During todays interrogation, Mukhiya is said to have told IT officials that he feared for his life. Sources said he admitted he had met Koda twice in the past, but claimed he wasnt part of any ongoing scam.         
	During raids IT officials have found nothing in my premises. Besides, I will share everything with IT officials, whatever I know, he apparently told IT officials.         
	The ED will begin interrogating Koda on November 15.         
	This is the third time it has rescheduled the former chief ministers appearance before it. Earlier, he was slated to appear before the ED on November 9, which was later shifted to November 11 after he was admitted to hospital.        
	The next stop for the investigating agencies, Srivastava said, would be Mumbai where they would be probing Kodas alleged hawala nexus. We have completed the better part of our interrogation and investigation here. Now, things are shifting to Mumbai, he said.

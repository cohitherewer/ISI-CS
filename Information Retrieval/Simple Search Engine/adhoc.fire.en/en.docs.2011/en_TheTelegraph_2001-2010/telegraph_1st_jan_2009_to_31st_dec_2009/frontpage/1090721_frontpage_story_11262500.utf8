The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | UK confused by flu advice
                                                                                                           UK confused by flu advice
                                A pedestrian in London. (Reuters)                            
	London, July 20 (AP): Health officials in Britain have issued a torrent of conflicting advice on swine flu, telling people to avoid travel, stay away from crowds and even advising women to delay getting pregnant until the virus subsides.        
	Other health experts said today the advice risked scaring and confusing the public and was a complete overreaction to a virus that so far remains mild.        
	Still, Britains press dug into the topic with relish, publishing bold headlines like Guards protect swine flu drugs and Swine flu alert for pregnant women and babies.        
	Since swine flu was declared a pandemic, or global outbreak, by the World Health Organisation in June, Britains response has swung between early claims that the virus was not spreading widely to recent predictions there could be 100,000 new cases a day by the end of August.        
	Britains department of health recommended yesterday that people with flu-like symptoms delay their holidays and other travellers take medicine with them and avoid public places if they get sick.        
	But since people with swine flu often are contagious before they even have symptoms, it was not clear that advice would slow the virus spread. You shouldnt rearrange your life around the virus at this point, said Gregory Hartl, a WHO spokesman. Most people who get swine flu, also known as H1N1, only experience mild symptoms and dont need any treatment to get better.        
	Even now, during the summer vacation period, WHO does not recommend any travel-related measures to prevent the spread of swine flu.        
	In its most controversial advice, the department of health recommended that it may be sensible for those trying for children to consider delaying conception whilst the pandemic is going on.        
	But the Royal College of General Practitioners called that advice scaremongering and said it was a completely disproportionate response since pandemics typically last for several years. It adds to the sense of hysteria and panic that seems to be engulfing the nation, the groups head, Dr. Steve Field, was quoted as saying in The Observer.

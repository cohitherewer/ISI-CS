  Vote barrier between food and famished          ZEESHAN JAWED                                                     
	Bijoynagar (Bali island in the Sunderbans), June 3: Moyna Mondal is in a fix: her three little ones are famished and she knows where the sackfuls of rice and dal have been stashed but she dare not scoop up a fistful.        
	Not for Joydeb, 3, not for Tanmoy, 5, not for Swapan, 8.        
	We can get relief material only if the panchayat distributes it. We cant take anything from the hut, said the 25-year-old mother, still wearing the red cotton sari in which she had left home after Cyclone Aila struck the Sunderbans on May 25.        
	My husband (Shyama Prasad) and I could not carry anything with us when the cyclone struck. So, government relief is our only option, Moyna added, clutching the tiny hands of Joydeb who did not even have a shirt on.        
	The mud house doubling as a relief godown is known to over 22,500 people in Bijoynagar, one of the mouzas in Bali II gram panchayat. Around 20 sacks of rice, six sacks of pulses and 200-odd tarpaulin sheets have been dumped outside the house.        
	Villagers claimed there was more relief material stashed inside but only a special category of people got access to it.        
	The RSP runs the panchayat here and they are distributing relief only among their supporters. If we take something from the hut, we would be implicated in police cases. Already, we have so many problems, we dont want a police case over and above that, said Subhash Mondal, a villager in his mid-seventies, sitting on the banks of the Durgaduani that flows along the village.        
	At least 100 half-fed or starving men and women, with hungry children in their laps, were squatting along the river banks when The Telegraph team reached Bali island this morning.        
	Last Sunday, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had briefly stopped at the island while touring Aila-affected areas in the Sunderbans. The chief minister had promised to speed up relief and assured the people that they would not be discriminated against during relief distribution.        
	The reality, however, is different in Bijoynagar, a traditional RSP stronghold.        
	According to local people, RSP leaders were getting even with the villagers as they had voted for the Trinamul-supported SUCI candidate, Tarun Mondal, during the Lok Sabha elections.         
	They want to show us that they are in control in the panchayat and so we are not getting government relief, said Hari Manna, who switched from the RSP to Trinamul two years ago.        
	At the BDO office in Gosaba, from where relief materials are sent to villages in mechanised boats or steamers under the supervision of panchayat members, block officials said the flow of relief was normal for the Bali II gram panchayat.        
	Even yesterday, we had sent around 30 sacks of rice, 18 sacks of pulses, 16 boxes of baby food and almost 300 tarpaulin sheets for Bali II gram panchayat. We are sending such shipments almost every alternate day, said Amiyo Bhushan Chakraborty, the Gosaba BDO.        
	But an on-the-ground assessment of distribution of relief revealed a different story.         
	Moynas family has, for instance, been famished since their mud house collapsed on May 25. The family of five has got only 3kg rice and two cups of pulses in the last 10 days.        
	The panchayat has not given us a tarpaulin sheet till now. It gets really difficult when it rains, said Moyna.        
	Although Moyna did not disclose who she had voted for in the Lok Sabha polls, some residents of Bijoynagar said a majority in the village had rejected the Left Front.        
	The SUCI candidate got a lead of over 2,000 votes from here and now we are paying the price, said Dulal Chandra Das, 35, a teacher in Bali Purbopara Primary School, which has been converted into a relief centre.        
	While BDO Chakraborty refused comment, Murari Mohan Gharami, the panchayat pradhan and an RSP leader, denied the allegations levelled against the panchayat.        
	We havent got adequate relief material to distribute among the people. Thats why people are famished. The panchayat is evenly distributing relief, said Gharami.        
	What about the mud house stashed with relief materials?        
	We are waiting for the next consignment of rice, pulses and tarpaulin sheets. We will distribute everything together once we receive more relief materials, he explained.        
	But Moyna and her kids cant wait any more. They need food, medicine and a shelter over their heads.        
	When the chief minister came to Bali Bidyapith, we wanted to go there to meet him. But we could not wade through the waist-deep water. We dont know how long we can survive like this, Moyna mumbled as Joydeb started crying for food.  
	ARMY SOS  
	Army doctors and engineers, naval boats and air force planes were alerted for Bengal on Wednesday after public outrage targeted at Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and his party colleagues moved the state government to SOS the Centre in the aftermath of Aila.

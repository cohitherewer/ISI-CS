The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | HPL rival near birth,   Citu in labour 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                HPL rival near birth,   Citu in labour 
          SAMBIT SAHA                                                    
	Calcutta, Nov. 23: A Trinamul Congress application to form a union at Haldia Petrochemicals has been lying with the state government for four months, one of the reasons that explains the timing of the Citu strike in the company.        
	The Trinamul union had filed an application with the state labour department for registration four months ago  a requirement before a company can recognise a labour wing and formally invite it to meetings.        
	Two hearings have taken place but the registration has not been given yet, confirmed Trinamul MP Subhendu Adhikari who has floated the union and has been trying to break into the turf of Lakshman Seth, the toppled CPM strongman of Haldia.        
	They (the Left government) are holding it up for reasons best known to them. I am confident most of the workers will join our union when it is officially allowed to be formed, Adhikari said.        
	The CPM union had called the strike demanding higher wages for contract labourers. Citu was seeking unusual hikes of up to 300 per cent to win over or retain the loyalty of 1,700-odd workers, fearing a switch to the rival union once it is given clearance.        
	The Citu disruption at the showpiece industrial project could not have been carried out without the blessings of the CPM, prompting fears in industry that it could signal a return to the days of militant trade unionism and encourage workers elsewhere to raise such demands.        
	Citu is seeking an over 300 per cent raise. Nowhere will one get such a sharp hike. HPL had offered up to 100 per cent, a trade union leader said during the day.        
	If Haldia Petro had agreed to Citus original suggestions, the company would have had to shell out Rs 23 crore more a year on contract labourers. It (Citu) wants to ram through something spectacular to protect its flanks, no matter the ramification in the industry, said a Calcutta-based industrialist.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | On TV: Great Indian poll theatre 
                                                                                                           On TV: Great Indian poll theatre 
  - Party activists throw chairs, come to blows in on-screen election debates         OUR BUREAU                                                    
	April 3: From verbal duels to slugfests, outdoor election debates on television are becoming a free-for-all, a security nightmare for channels hoping to give viewers a real feel of the great Indian political theatre.        
	From Kerala to Bengal and the tense hinterland of Uttar Pradesh, the political rivalry is spilling onto the dais, and into the living rooms of voters.         
	Channel honchos say the programmes were designed because the ambience of the elections can never be conveyed from the environs of a studio. Therefore, they sought to give viewers a slice of the action zone where electioneering is on in full swing.         
	In this, the channels have taken a leaf out of the debates between political gladiators in western democracies. Ideally, the election-based debate, shot on location as in the West, should go on peacefully as the moderator introduces candidates, initiates the discussion, steers it to the right topics and gives opportunities for everyone to have their say. Audience participation, which is enthusiastic and active, is limited to questions, and not brickbats, being thrown to the candidates.         
	But in India, rival party activists are slugging it out in the open  and on camera  in a brazen symbolism of the muscle power that supplants verbal power in the worlds largest democracy.        
	The latest incident of such violence occurred in Kerala on Wednesday when police had to use batons to restore order during a shoot and avoid damage to the television crew and equipment.         
	The programme, being organised by a leading vernacular channel in Kozhikode, had to be abandoned as supporters of CPM candidate Mohammed Riyaz charged at Congress nominee M.K. Raghavan. His fault: Riyaz, in spite of his assurance to the organisers, did not turn up for the show.         
	If his supporters had not formed a human shield around him, Raghavan would have suffered a few blows from SFI and DYFI activists. The latter have denied involvement but the footage shows otherwise.         
	You cant run this show without our leader, shouted one of his supporters and the rest joined in. The anchor tried to explain but the youths grew restive and finally lunged towards the podium, targeting Raghavan.         
	Kerala channels have borne the brunt of the violence given the volatile political atmosphere in the state.        
	The season of slugfests began at a show organised by another vernacular channel in Palakkad, when BJP and CPM activists traded blows over a question on Varun Gandhi. Chairs flew, forcing candidates to flee.         
	In adjacent Alathur, a BJP youth leader landed in hospital for his misadventure during a televised debate. The provocation was a simple question to CPM candidate and SFI all-India president P.K. Biju: Why is the monthly farmer pension just Rs 200 when your government is paying the madarsa teacher Rs 4,000?         
	In Kottayam, three people were injured when a Congress worker asked CPM candidate Suresh Kurup, MP, his achievements on the development front. But Kurups supporters dealt him a few blows in reply.         
	Of the four reality shows recorded at Kottayam, two were marred by chair throwing.         
	Bengal, Keralas comrade-in-arms, too has seen ugly scenes. On March 18, a Bengali TV channel had organised a programme in Barasat where the two main candidates, Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar of the Trinamul Congress and Sudin Chattopadhyay of the Forward Bloc, were brought together to field questions from the public. As the political temperature rose, some Left supporters climbed on the dais where the two candidates were sitting.        
	Not to be left behind, Trinamul workers followed, triggering a free-for-all on stage.        
	Chattopadhyay claimed he was hit on the chest and collapsed and had to be carried away; Ghosh Dastidar said she was hit on the leg. As the situation got out of hand, the show had to be called off.        
	I have informed the Election Commission about the incident as well as filed a complaint with the police. Had the police not rescued me I could have been killed by the supporters of Sudin Chattopadhyay. I was badly injured and had to be treated, said Ghosh Dastidar.        
	In Uttar Pradesh, supporters of the BJP and the BSP clashed during a live programme, prompting the Election Commission to seek a report from the district administration. Five persons were injured in the clash. The rival supporters had allegedly come prepared for battle with lathis.        
	While politicians have accused the channel of stage- managing the show to get ratings, the TV station says the political parties used its platform to exhibit their muscle power.        
	In another incident, a vernacular news channel in Mumbai was left red-faced when the audience at a live show got up on stage and abused the participants in colourful language and threatened the anchors.        
	Over 250 people had been invited and it became difficult to manage them as everybody wanted to say their bit. Being a live show the whole thing went out of hand but the channel went ahead with the airing as it made for good television, said an industry source. Some TV executives say much depends on the person conducting the show.         
	Situations can get ugly. I have conducted many such electoral debates in public. I can only say that controlling the mob and political leaders depends on the anchors skill in handling such sensitive situations. They can be avoided if the anchor is firm and experienced, said Ravish Kumar, output editor of NDTV India.

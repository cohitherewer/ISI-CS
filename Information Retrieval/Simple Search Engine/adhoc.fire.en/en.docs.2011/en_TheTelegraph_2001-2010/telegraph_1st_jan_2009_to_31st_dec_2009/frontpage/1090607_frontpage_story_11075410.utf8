The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Hospital travels to heart patient
                                                                                                           Hospital travels to heart patient
          G.S. MUDUR                       Meena Devi, one of the patients, recovering after surgery                           
	New Delhi, June 6: An act of defiance by cardiac surgeon Om Prakash Yadava has helped Soniya Kohli, a 20-year-old college student in a remote mountain town of Uttarakhand, walk again without fear.        
	In a four-hour surgical procedure, Yadava replaced a severely leaking valve in her heart with an artificial titanium valve. The former army surgeon says it is a routine operation  except that it was a couple of hundred kilometres out of place.        
	Kohli had her surgery two weeks ago at Dena Hospital, about 10km north of Almora town in Uttarakhand, a state with 8.5 million people but not a single medical facility equipped for heart surgery.        
	Challenging Uttarakhand authorities, Yadava and a medical team from the National Heart Institute (NHI) in New Delhi and Dena Hospital conducted the states first open-heart surgeries on a set of three patients.        
	Dena Hospital was set up about eight years ago by an NGO called Jan Jagaran Samiti with support from Dena Kaye, daughter of legendary Hollywood actor-comedian Danny Kaye. It has operation theatres and intensive care units, but they are equipped only for general surgical procedures such as abdominal operations or Caesarean sections.        
	Heart patients who need surgery have to find a hospital outside the state, said Yadava, chief cardiac surgeon at the NHI. For several months last year, Yadava had organised medical camps at Almora to detect heart disease and sought state assistance to fund the expenses of several patients who then travelled to Delhi for surgery.        
	But it is difficult for patients to travel. Relatives come along, they have to pay for their stay in Delhi. It is expensive and inconvenient, said Yadava, who opened a dialogue with the state government seeking a cardiac surgery facility at Almora.        
	After an initial positive signal last year, the state appeared to dither. Yadava recalls that chief minister B.C. Khanduri himself told a public gathering at Almora in January this year that cardiac surgery there might be unsafe and the state would set up a facility elsewhere.        
	It was disappointing to hear that, Yadava said. The safety issue was gibberish.        
	Yadava transplanted an entire cardiac surgery unit  surgeons, anaesthetists, operation theatre nurses, technicians and biomedical engineers  to Dena Hospital for a five-day camp to demonstrate that open-heart surgery could be done in the mountains.        
	The NHI contacted a commercial packer who placed a heart-lung machine, ventilators, heart status monitors and other equipment in a truck for the 10-hour journey. The doctors and other staff followed in three cars.        
	The first patient was Meena Devi, a 31-year-old mother of two with a hole in her heart. The second was Hemant Singh Tolia, 36, with a similar problem. Yadava, assisted by chief anaesthetist Arvind Prakash and others, corrected their defect. Third patient Soniyas problem was more challenging.        
	All three surgeries went very well, Nikhil Kumar, a physician at Dena Hospital said. This is a milestone for the people here. Theres reason for fresh hope now.        
	Kohli, a second-year BA student, said it felt great to be able to walk again without the breathlessness, without the tiredness, without the fear.         
	Doctors estimate that establishing a heart surgery unit would cost about Rs 10 crore. Thats peanuts for a state, Yadava said. The unit would also require a full-time team of 18 to 20 people  doctors and medical staff with specialised training.        
	Raising the money might be a lot easier than finding the doctors, said a public health expert in Delhi.

	Ranchi, Feb. 11: Indicating his seriousness about stepping up the pace of development in Jharkhand, often held hostage to nagging political instability, Governor Syed Sibtey Razi said he was open to changing government policies if it made a difference.        
	As a first, he promised to come out with a surrender policy to facilitate the return of misguided youth to the mainstream.         
	Razi, who held his maiden meeting today with divisional commissioners, IGs, DIGs, DCs and SPs after taking charge of the state under Presidents rule, read out the riot act to officials asking them to ensure proper implementation of the excise, forest and transport policies to ensure there was no revenue squeeze.         
	Their job is not merely limited to maintaining law and order. We want money in the states coffers. If need be, we will remove the bottlenecks in existing policies to shore up revenues, he declared at the meeting, where he was assisted by his advisers G. Krishnan, Sunila Basant and T. P. Sinha. Chief secretary A.K. Basu and DGP V.D. Ram were also present.         
	Razi has now called a meeting of his council of advisers on Friday to deliberate on the draft surrender policy, the excise policy  the department has presented a reworked draft  and other matters. He pointed out the state had achieved only 40 per cent of the Plan target. The months of February and March are crucial for the development of the state. Thats why I ensured non-gazetted employees called off their strike, he said.        
	The governor asked officials to focus on centrally sponsored schemes, particularly the Bharat Nirman Yojana, which had a direct impact on people.         
	He called for a comprehensive policy to ensure development work wasnt affected in the Naxalite-hit areas. Ten of the 35 highly sensitive rebel districts in the country are in Jharkhand  Bokaro, Chatra, Hazaribagh, East Singhbhum and West Singhbhum, Palamau, Garhwa, Gumla, Latehar and Lohardaga. So, the administration should show its presence and ensure schools and hospitals run smoothly in these areas, he said.        
	Meanwhile, first lady Chand Farhana also held a meeting with deputy commissioners and asked them to set up child welfare councils in every district. She is the vice-chairperson of the state child welfare council.

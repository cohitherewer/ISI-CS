The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Mamata cites Rajiv in aid call
                                                                                                           Mamata cites Rajiv in aid call
          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi, May 30: Mamata Banerjee has invoked a concept pioneered by Rajiv Gandhi to demand that the Bengal government be bypassed in central relief efforts for victims of Cyclone Aila, and asked the Prime Minister to prioritise emergency supplies over financial aid.         
	The Trinamul Congress chief today met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, home minister P. Chidambaram, defence minister A.K. Antony and finance minister Pranab Mukherjee to draw up the contours of the Centres post-rescue relief work.        
	Rajiv Gandhi had coined the phrase PM-to-DM (district magistrate). I said (to the Prime Minister) it can be altered a bit to make it PM to gram panchayats, which are best equipped with knowledge of ground realities in Bengal, Banerjee said after the meeting.         
	Ordinarily, aid  material or monetary  from the Centre in times of calamity is handed over to state governments, which are responsible for implementing relief efforts.         
	But senior bureaucrats in Delhi confirmed that the Prime Minister could issue executive directives ordering aid to be transferred directly to panchayati raj institutions.         
	The phrase PM-to-DM originated when Rajiv Gandhi launched a drive to strengthen the panchayat system and local self-governance.         
	By citing the late Prime Minister, Mamata may have made it harder for the UPA government  headed by the Congress  to reject the demand on grounds of technicalities.         
	Officially, the PMO had no comment to offer. The matter is a tricky one. On the one hand, acceding to the Trinamul leaders demand may seem as if the Prime Minister has made himself party to the politicking over relief funds in Bengal. On the other hand, spurning a major ally may not be the best way of beginning his second innings in power.         
	Sources suggested the issue would most likely be handled at a political, and a more low profile, level, leaving the PMO out of the picture. There are ways of doing this without the Prime Minister attracting allegations of acting out of bias, a source said.        
	Officials say one option is to route the funds through the state government but after earmarking specific requirements of each district or zilla parishad by a central team. The respective local body can then co-ordinate the relief effort and monitor if the money is being disbursed in line with the prescribed formula.        
	Although Manmohan enjoys a good rapport with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, the sources said eventually the Congresss political concerns could weigh heavier than personal relationship.         
	In Bengal, finance minister Asim Dasgupta said bypassing the state government would be unconstitutional.        
	Mamata, who raised the need for a master plan for flood control and to prevent river erosion, said she asked the Prime Minister for massive emergency survival material.         
	Only after emergency relief material has saved people from disease, hunger and death, can the process of rebuilding lives begin. The Bengal government cant seem to provide food, water and medicines, but they want money, she said, scoffing at the request for a Rs 1,000-crore relief package.

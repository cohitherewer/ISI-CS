The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Finally, a CMO on table
                                                                                                           Finally, a CMO on table
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Bhattacharjee                                  
	Calcutta, Sept. 15: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will have a Chief Ministers Office (CMO), nine years after a proposal to seek expert help was mooted and in the slog overs of what looks like a tumultuous run-up to the Assembly polls.         
	The CMO, more or less on the lines of the Prime Ministers Office, is expected to induct experts on health, education, labour and industry and tap them for inputs to make governance fast and effective, a source at Writers Buildings said.        
	However, some officials said the move could turn out to be a case of too little, too late with Assembly elections 20 months away and a resurgent Opposition snapping at the heels of the government.         
	It need not have been so. In 2000, when Bhattacharjee was sworn in chief minister, a plan was mooted to bring in IAS officer Ashoke Bose as the key hand in his secretariat, but it did not move beyond the conception stage. During Jyoti Basus first term as chief minister, CPM ideologue Satyabrata Sen had been made economic adviser.        
	The source said it would take about a month to formalise the likely composition of the CMO and the names of experts. The chief minister wants competent persons outside the government, besides serving officials, the source added.        
	This is an area where pitfalls could lurk if the party is unable to resist the familiar temptation to pack such set-ups with its faithful, disregarding merit.         
	Explaining the reasons for setting up the CMO, an official at Bhattacharjees secretariat said today: The chief minister is preoccupied with lots of work different in nature. He needs inputs on the governments functioning and background material at short notice. For this, a separate set-up is necessary. It will be a sort of replica of the PMO but smaller in size. With the CMO, the chief minister will have to depend less on other departments.        
	A CPM leader said such a formal set-up would also help streamline work involving ministers from allies, some of whom sit on files now. With a CMO, departments held by allies will be forced to send papers asked for as everything will be official. A minister may ignore a verbal directive by the CM, but will find it difficult not to respond to the CMOs written request, he said.        
	The proposal for the CMO, already cleared by the finance and law departments, will be placed before the cabinet on September 23. After the cabinet approval, the proposal will be sent to the governor.        
	The chief ministers secretariat is now made of 90-odd personnel and overseen by principal secretary Subes Das.        
	According to an official, the chief minister had come up with the idea of the CMO after discussions with the chief secretary and the principal secretary.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | RSS keeps thinking cap warm for Jaswants son
                                                                                                           RSS keeps thinking cap warm for Jaswants son
  - Manvendras silence earns him seat at meeting, Arun (Lewis Carroll) Shourie also on list           RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                            Manvendra Singh                                        
	New Delhi, Sept. 9: Expelled BJP leader Jaswant Singhs son Manvendra Singh is on the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sanghs A-list of invitees for a thinkers meet that began today in Utan, a north Mumbai suburb.        
	Arun Shourie, too, is on the list, though the former Union minister had last month dubbed the BJP a Humpty Dumpty party and its chief Rajnath Singh Alice in Blunderland, taunting the brass with words borrowed from Lewis Carroll.        
	While the RSS has steadfastly backed Shourie, even after his stinger missiles at L.K. Advani and Rajnath, the inclusion of former Rajasthan MP Manvendra for the two-day session has drawn a mixed response from the parivar.        
	I am perfectly at home in the sylvan surroundings and look forward to interacting with the RSS and BJP leaders in the meeting thats about to start, Manvendra told The Telegraph.         
	BJP sources said Manvendra, a member of the partys youth brigade, has been attending this gathering for the past few years, including the last held in 2004.         
	I have not said or done anything against my party, Manvendra said, refusing to be drawn into the debate generated by his fathers book on Pakistans founder Jinnah that led to Jaswants expulsion last month.        
	This has not gone unnoticed by us and the Sangh, a BJP source said. Manvendra could have easily spoken up for Jaswant Singhji but he lay low. It boosted his ranking in the party.        
	Parivar sources said the BJP-RSS hoped to blunt the criticism after Jaswants sack and the ban on his book in Gujarat by being nice to Manvendra.         
	After the Sanghs endorsement, Manvendra, the sources said, is certain to remain a member of the BJPs national executive and mentor its young MPs.        
	Other BJP leaders who figure on the guest list of 30 include Rajnath, Sushma Swaraj, Murli Manohar Joshi and Bal Apte.        
	While Rajnaths inclusion as party chief was self-explanatory, the sources said, Apte unofficially functions as the RSSs point man in the party.        
	Joshi, regarded as a loner without a following, made it as an old Sangh favourite. Sushma is seen as an Advani loyalist.        
	The list was personally drawn up by Sangh chief Mohanrao Bhagwat.                     Arun Shourie    
	The objective, the sources said, was essentially to broadbase the BJP representation and ensure every shade of opinion was articulated at the meeting that is expected to focus on ideology, RSS-BJP equation and the state of the party itself.        
	If Joshi is thought to represent the conservatives who believe that ideology and governance cannot and should not be de-coupled, Sushma is supposed to be closer to the Advani line of de-ideologising governance.        
	Apart from members of the parivar, the invitees include sympathisers and resource persons associated with it, the sources said.        
	Although the discussions would not be gridlocked by an agenda, the sources conceded that the thrust would be on the BJP.        
	They expected a positive look ahead, grounded on two decisions the RSS has more or less finalised: separation of the BJPs parliamentary and political wings and a state leader as the next party president.        
	The Sangh, it seems, has conveyed to Delhi leaders that if the BJP is to retain its cadres, drawn principally from the RSS, they should give Rajnaths successor a free hand in organisational affairs and in running the parliamentary party.

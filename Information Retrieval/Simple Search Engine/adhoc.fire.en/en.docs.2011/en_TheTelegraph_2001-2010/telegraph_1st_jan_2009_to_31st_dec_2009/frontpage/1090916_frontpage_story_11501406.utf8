          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jamshedpur, Sept. 15: A first-year MCA student of Adityapur-based National Institute of Technology (NIT) committed suicide by hanging himself from the ceiling fan of his hostel room this evening.        
	Satyendra Kumar Singh, 22, hailed from Hazaribagh and had joined the college only three months ago.        
	College sources said that a section of students spotted Satyendra hanging with a towel in a room on the second floor of I hostel. The students brought him down immediately, when he was still reportedly alive.        
	Soon, they informed the college administration, which rushed the student to Tata Main Hospital, where the doctors at the emergency declared him as brought dead.        
	The incident took place around 7pm. The student was suffering from depression and was not interacting with others since he joined the college. The student was also appearing for the mid-term examination, which started yesterday. He also appeared for the examination in the first-half today. We are shocked, said Malay Niraj, an NIT spokesperson.         
	RIT police station officer-in-charge Anand Mishra said that prima facie it appeared to be a case of suicide. An inquiry will make things clear, he said.         
	According to Niraj, the parents of the deceased were yet to be informed about his death. We contacted his parents at Hazaribagh and told them that their son is not well and hence they should come to see him, said Niraj.         
	The news came as a shock to us, said a student of NIT, on condition of anonymity.

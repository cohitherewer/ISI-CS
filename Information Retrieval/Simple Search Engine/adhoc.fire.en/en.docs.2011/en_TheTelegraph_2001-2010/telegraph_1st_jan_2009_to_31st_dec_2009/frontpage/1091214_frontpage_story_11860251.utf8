	Ranchi, Dec. 13: The electorate in the 14 Maoist-hit constituencies, which went to polls in the fourth phase yesterday, appears to have celebrated democracy in a big way as the final turnout figure, released by the Election Commission today, stood at 64.3 per cent, the highest so far.        
	The initial figure released yesterday was 58.64 per cent. Turnout figures recorded in the last three phases were 53.10, 58.82 and 57.21 per cent, respectively.        
	According to joint chief electoral officer Ashok Kumar Sinha, 10 constituencies recorded more than 60 per cent turnout with Baharagora logging the highest with 76.16 per cent, followed by Ichagarh with 75.31 per cent.        
	Ghatshila, where Congress nominee and partys chief ministerial aspirant Pradeep Balmuchu was said to be on a sticky wicket, recorded 64.03 per cent polling.        
	The turnout was also significant as 12 of the 14 constituencies were reserved for Scheduled Tribes.        
	Sinha attributed the huge turnout to the confidence generated by tight security as well as enthusiasm of the electorate and added that voters had shown their disregard for the Maoist ideology of armed struggle.         
	He also claimed that Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhonis appeal to the electorate had also helped bring out voters on polling day.        
	A 20-second video capsule of the Election Commission had Dhoni playing a series of square cuts before appealing to the people to exercise their franchise in the ongoing five-phase Assembly elections.        
	We had devised several plans before the elections to encourage people to cast their votes. The plan to rope in Dhoni has had a great impact and really paid off, Sinha said.        
	Dhoni, listed as a voter in Ranchi, interestingly, did not exercise his franchise as he was busy with the India-Australia cricket series. Ranchi went to poll on November 25.

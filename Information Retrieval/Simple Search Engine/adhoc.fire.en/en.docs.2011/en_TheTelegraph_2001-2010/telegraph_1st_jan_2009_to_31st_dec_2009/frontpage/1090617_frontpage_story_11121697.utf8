	Ranchi, June 16: Governor Syed Sibtey Razi today read the riot act to senior police officers with a clear message: perform or perish.        
	Taking strong exception to the spurt in Naxalite violence and the sharp deterioration in the law and order situation in the state, Razi summoned the police top brass, including DGP V.D. Ram, and adviser T.P. Sinha, and directed them to improve the intelligence network.         
	Convening the meeting soon after reaching the state capital from New Delhi today, Razi took the Ranchi senior superintendent of police Praveen Kumar, to task and said the people of the state had lost confidence in the police due to the recent incidents of violence in the capital.        
	In the last 10 days, the capital has seen as many as five incidents of shootings and as many deaths due to disputes ranging from business rivalries to public protests. This apart, Ranchi has had its regular share of robberies.        
	The governor directed the SSP to step up police patrolling in the capital and start arresting criminals under the Crime Control Act. I will not tolerate any laxity in maintaining the law and order, he is understood to have said.        
	Razi said the states existing intelligence network wasnt effective and asked the police to take the help of Intelligence Bureau if it so desired.         
	He also stressed on imparting special training to jawans posted in Naxalite-hit areas, adding that police personnel posted in those areas should follow dos and donts strictly, while on patrol duty.         
	Sources added that Ram, too, admitted that despite clear directions, policemen did not follow the instructions strictly. He, however, promised that all possible steps would be taken to implement safety measures and the intelligence network, too, would be strengthened.

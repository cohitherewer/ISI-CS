                                                                                                           No schools for coastal kids 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          Childhood lost?		    
	Cuttack, March 4: The Orissa State Human Rights Commission (OSHRC) has ordered an administrative inquiry into how hundreds of children in the Satavaya area of Kendrapada district were denied academic opportunities.        
	The commission had taken up the allegation after the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) referred to it a petition seeking its intervention for protecting the childrens Right to Education.        
	Committee for Legal Aid to Poor (CLAP), a Cuttack-based legal advocacy outfit, had moved the NHRC after a fact-finding team constituted by it under its liberated childhood movement programme found how the children of the Satavaya area had no access to primary or secondary education.        
	The commission has directed the commissioner-cum-secretary of the department of school and mass education to submit a report within three weeks, CLAP executive vice-president Bikash Das told The Telegraph today.        
	A cluster of villages  Satavaya, Balisahi, Rabindrapalli, Magarkanda, Kanhupur and Barahipur over 50km from Rajnagar block headquarters in Kendrapara district  have received scant attention from the education authorities both at the district and state level. The villages are located on the edge of Bay of Bengal.        
	Over 520 children in the age group of 6-14 are deprived of quality primary, upper primary and secondary education. There is no high school within a distance of 10 to 18km, Das said.        
	The area is surrounded by the sea and the Bhitarkanika National Park. The Baunsapada river, 50m wide, is a natural barrier for the children to walk over 10 to 18km a day to pursue secondary education, he added.        
	Das said the report of the fact-finding team indicated that there were only two primary schools for all the six clusters of villages. Both primary schools had a one-room (20ftx10ft) makeshift structure which was used as classrooms for students of standard I to V.        
	There was only one teacher at the Magarakanda primary school with 220 children from classes I to V. At Barahipurs Panchbarahi Nodal U.P. School, there were three teachers for 300 children of classes I to VII.         
	There was no high school within a distance of 10-18km. Frequent tidal waves make communication difficult. During the rainy season, the black soil melts and therefore, the area is cut off, the report submitted to the NHRC said.

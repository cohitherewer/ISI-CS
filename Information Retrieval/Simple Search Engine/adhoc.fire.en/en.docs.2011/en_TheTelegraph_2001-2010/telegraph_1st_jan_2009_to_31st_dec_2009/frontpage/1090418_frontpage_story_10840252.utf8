  - SRK puts his case before Sourav 
          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            Sourav Ganguly and Shah Rukh Khan in Calcutta during the first IPL season                                  
	Cape Town, April 17: Shah Rukh Khan and the Kolkata Knight Riders respect Sourav Gangulys genius, as the principal owner himself put it not long ago, but his captaincy skills dont seem to count for much.        
	Sourav, Indias most successful Test captain (and the franchises icon), is no longer at the helm of the Knight Riders. His seat has gone to New Zealands Brendon McCullum, cricket manager John Buchanans pick.        
	According to The Telegraphs sources, Buchanan had a one-on-one with Sourav on Wednesday, soon after the Knight Riders landed here from Bloemfontein.        
	Buchanan, one learns, told Sourav that the New Zealand vice-captain was his choice to lead in the Indian Premier League (IPL)s second edition, which gets under way tomorrow.        
	McCullum was given the news yesterday.        
	Apparently, West Indies captain Chris Gayle too was sounded out, but he declined, saying he didnt know the players well enough.                  
	Im okay... Ill play as an ordinary player and support McCullum in whatever way I can. Shah Rukh has spoken to me and hes given Buchanan everything he wanted, including the captain, and stated that there could now be no excuse for not performing, Sourav said, speaking exclusively at The Cullinan hotel, late this evening.        
	The Knight Riders finished sixth in the IPLs maiden season, last year.        
	Sourav sounded reasonably calm, and seemed to enjoy his cup of coffee, aware perhaps that the pressure today was on McCullum and Buchanan, not so much on him.        
	He didnt talk of the future, but somebody close to him confirmed that he would take a call at the end of this edition. If Sourav has to leave the franchise, hell consider doing so only after performing and making a point.        
	While Sourav himself didnt say anything, one learns he has been asking those closest to him just one question: Why me all the time? Clearly, he wants to know why coaches (or a cricket manager) are so wary of working with him.        
	It was Greg Chappell in 2005, its another Australian now.        
	After a series of flip-flops, Shah Rukh went along with Buchanan and became the third owner (after the Deccan Chargers bosses and the Bangalore Royal Challengers Vijay Mallya) to either initiate the move or endorse a change at the top.        
	The entire business, though, could have been handled much better and Sourav given the respect an icon should be getting.        
	All that didnt stop Shah Rukh from actually bowling to Sourav after the Knight Riders formal practice session ended for the day. As the googly had already been bowled, nothing menacing was unleashed.         
	Incidentally, by deciding on one captain, Buchanan has in fact backtracked on his no fixed captain theory. Its to be seen how the multiple leaders bit is implemented in a competitive scenario.        
	The Knight Riders first match, against the Chargers, is here on Sunday.

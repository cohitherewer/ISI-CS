          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA AMP; SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                              
	Ranchi, Feb. 25: In an unprecedented move, the Governors advisory council today recommended dismissal of Jharkhand Public Service Commission (JPSC) chairman Dilip Kumar Prasad, member Gopal Prasad Singh and former member Radha Govind Singh Nagesh all of whom are under cloud for having allegedly favoured friends and relatives while conducting various recruitment tests.        
	The council has requested President Pratibha Patil to order an inquiry into their affairs and approve the institution of criminal cases against them. As per rules, alleged acts of omission and commission by the chairman and members of state public service commissions are to be probed by a Supreme Court judge after a presidential nod.        
	The governors approval comes in the backdrop of Raj Bhavan receiving a clutch of complaints, including one from the UGC seeking his intervention in the JPSCs appointment of 239 civil servants and 1,044 lecturers, at least 36 of whom were said to be relatives or friends of the JPSC members and politicians.        
	In fact, the governor who appointed four members  R.C. Kaithal, Wilfred Lakra, A.K. Sengupta and Pervez Hasan  to the JPSC yesterday, had earlier approved a state government proposal for a presidential reference against Singh in November last year. However, the Shibu Soren government sat over it.        
	By then, the governor had already ordered a vigilance inquiry in the limited competitive examinations held for recruiting 60 deputy collectors from government employees.        
	Sacking a commission member for corruption involves an elaborate process. According to the Constitution, a commission member can be removed or penalised only after the Supreme Court conducts an inquiry on a presidential reference that has to be first okayed by the governor and then sent by the state government.         
	The governor is also empowered to suspend a member until the President issues orders based on the report of the Supreme Court.

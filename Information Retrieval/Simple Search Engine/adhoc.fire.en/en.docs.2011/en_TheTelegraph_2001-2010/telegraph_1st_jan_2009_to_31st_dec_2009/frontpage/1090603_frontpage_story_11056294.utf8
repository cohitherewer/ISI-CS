The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | BJP finds its poll plank
                                                                                                           BJP finds its poll plank
          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                            Karia Munda                                  
	Ranchi, June 2: If Karia Mundas nomination as Lok Sabha deputy Speaker is seen to be the BJP central leaderships masterstroke against the Congresss Dalit pitch in naming Meira Kumar Speaker, the party in Jharkhand sees the Khunti MPs elevation as a huge morale booster.         
	Jharkhand could face Assembly poll in November and the state BJP, already on a roll after its success in the Lok Sabha elections in the state, seems to have found its campaign focus. Riding high on the anti-incumbency factor, the BJP bagged eight of the 14 seats and supported former Assembly speaker Inder Singh Namdharis victory as an Independent.        
	Seven-term MP, the 72-year-old Munda enjoys the reputation of being an honest and down to earth politician.        
	A minister in the Morarji Desai government and later in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee ministry, Munda believes he was chosen because of his experience.        
	Born in 1936, Munda is a post graduate from Ranchi University. He also served as MLA in Bihar and later in Jharkhand. Having made several attempts at becoming chief minister of Jharkhand, he famously lost out to Babulal Marandi in 2000.        
	Now, the state BJP has identified him as a good election plank. Its an honour for the people of Jharkhand who supported the BJP to give it eight seats in Parliament, said State BJP president Raghubar Das.         
	Former finance minister and Hazaribagh MP Yashwant Sinha said his party had always been a champion of backwards and tribals. His (Karia Mundas) clean and honest image endeared him to the central leadership to get the coveted post, Sinha pointed out.        
	The party leaderships decision has given us a trump card in Jharkhand to wean away tribal supporters from other regional parties, said former chief minister Arjun Munda and MP from Jamshedpur, no doubt hinting at the JMM whose vote share fell to 11.70 per cent in the Lok Sabha elections.        
	Munda attributed his nomination to the coveted post of deputy speaker to his seniority in the House. I will discharge the responsibility given to me in all sincerity and honesty, he said, but refused to comment on his likely poll impact in Jharkhand.         
	We will see when elections are held in Jharkhand, said the veteran politician who shares a one-to-one relationship with a large part of his electorate in Khunti.

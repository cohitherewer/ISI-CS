The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Shiv Basant is new chief secretary
                                                                                                           Shiv Basant is new chief secretary
          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                              
	Ranchi, Aug. 28: Shiv Basant will be the new chief secretary of the state, while his wife Sunila is set to resign as one of the advisers to the governor apparently to avoid any controversy.        
	Union home minister P. Chidambaram today cleared the appointment of the 1976-batch IAS officer, who is likely to take charge on September 1 as the present incumbent, A.K. Basu, retires on August 31.        
	At present, Basant is the state finance commission chairman.        
	Governors adviser G. Krishnan, who holds charge of the personnel department, has confirmed the development.        
	Other IAS officers who were in the race for the states top bureaucratic posting included ATI director-general A.K. Singh (1977 batch) and development commissioner Sushil Kumar Chaudhary (1977).         
	JSEB chairman A.K. Chugh (1974) happens to be the senior-most IAS officer in the state, but he wasnt in the running after the governor cleared his central deputation.                          
	Sunila, a retired IAS officer, made it easier for her husband by deciding to quit as governors adviser. And according to sources, Wilfred Lakra, member of the Jharkhand Public Service Commission, is being thought of to be her replacement in the governors adisory council.        
	According to the sources, Governor K. Sankaranarayanan wanted Union agriculture secretary T. Nandkumar, a Jharkhand-cadre IAS officer, to return to the state and take charge as chief secretary. However, Nandkumar apparently refused the proposal, citing personal reasons. Thereafter, the governor recommended Basants name.        
	Regarding Sunilas impending resignation, a Raj Bhavan official said that there was no technical or legal hurdle in her continuing as adviser after her husband becomes the chief secretary. Also, she is not the one who wuld be writing the confidential report of the chief secretary.         
	But, she has volunteered to quit after her husbands appointment.        
	Now, Raj Bhavan is toying with the idea of appointing her chief information commissioner  for which she was already recommended by the Koda government along with Anand Bhushan and Sandeep Verma as information commissioners.        
	However, the proposal is likely to hit a legal roadblock, as the state had taken a stand, in a case in the high court that Kodas successor Shibu Soren had not re-sent the file. Also, under the Right to Information Act, a collegium comprising the chief minister, leader of Opposition and a minister nominated by the chief minister appoints the chief information commissioner and information commissioners.        
	Since the state is under Presidents rule, there is neither a chief minister nor a leader of the Opposition. So the governor faces a Hobsons choice _ whether to to act on the Koda governments proposal or make a fresh appointment on his own, said former advocate-general Anil Kumar Sinha.        
	Basant would be the ninth chief secretary of the state after V.S. Dubey, G. Krishnan, A.K. Mishra, Laxmi Singh, P.P. Sharma (two terms), M.K. Mandal and A.K. Chugh.

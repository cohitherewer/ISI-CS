	Kharagpur, Sept. 27: Men claiming to be Maoists rang up the wives of two kidnapped constables and asked them to tell senior officers their husbands would be killed unless Chhatradhar Mahato was released.
    
	Late tonight, however, Sisir Kanti Nag, 43, and Jiteswar Prasad Singh, 48, were set free after being told the kidnappers had found out they did not belong to reactionary families, police sources said.
    
	The hostages, however, had to give three undertakings: never to torture villagers, to protest the governments discriminatory treatment of the police lower ranks, and to try to persuade the police brass not to let plainclothes personnel enter villages.
    
	The last probably relates to yesterdays incident when two officers disguised as journalists had arrested Chhatradhar, the chief of the Maoist-backed Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities who had led the Lalgarh tribal agitation. Hours later, around 7pm, Sisir and Jiteswar were kidnapped at gunpoint from a bus in Belpahari at a spot 50km from Lalgarh.
    
	Freed somewhere not far from the Jharkhand border at 9 tonight, the duo lost their way in the darkness before reaching the Jamtalgera police camp on foot around 10.45. A Maoist phone call had already informed the police of their release.
    
	Earlier, district superintendent of police Manoj Verma had said it was not possible to meet the abductors demand.
    
	Both constables wives, who live in Kharagpur while their husbands are posted at the Banspahari police camp in Belpahari, received one call around 10 last night and another at 2 this afternoon. Jiteswars wife Rekha said last nights call was made from her husbands mobile.
    
	A man who identified himself as Sasadhar told me, We are Maoists and have taken your husband and his colleague with us. Tell the sahebs in the police to release our leader Chhatradhar Mahato or else we will kill Jiteswar and Sisir. I begged them not to harm my husband but the line went dead, the mother of three teenaged children said.
    
	Chhatradhars younger brother Sasadhar is a leader of the Maoist action squad in Lalgarh but it isnt clear whether he was the caller. Chhatradhar is not a Maoist although the caller appears to have described him as our leader.
    
	Sisir, allowed to speak to wife Dalia this afternoon, apparently feared for his life. He told me he was resigned to his fate. He said, Prepare for the worst and look after our children, a sobbing Dalia  who has a 12-year-old son and six-year-old daughter  had said this evening.
    
	Police sources said the men were freed probably because of two reasons.
    
	One, Jharkhand police, told of the abductions, had amassed huge forces on the inter-state border thus making hostage movement difficult. Two, Bengal police had raided half-a-dozen villages in Belpahari and detained about 100 people for questioning, and the Maoists may have feared the harassed villagers might turn against them.
    
	Police sources said Sisir and Jiteswar were released at a spot 2km from the police camp at Chhurimara but lost their way in the darkness to end up at Jamtalgera.

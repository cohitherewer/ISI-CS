                                                                                                                 - Oscars for 3 Indians: Everybody embraces Bollywood but wont say so					 					      AMIT ROY                                                    
	Los Angeles, Feb. 23: A Bollywood gang led by an exuberant Anil Kapoor went to town last night claiming Slumdog Millionaires eight-Oscar sweep was an historic triumph for Indian cinema with A.R. Rahman picking up not one but two Academy music awards.        
	Gordon Brown swiftly stepped in and insisted the film was British. I think we should be very proud of what are great British successes, declared the UK Prime Minister.        
	Not to be outdone, the Americans said the film had got where it had because of crucial backing from Hollywood. Even the European Community said Slumdog had received financial support from the media fund.        
	The irony is that at one stage when the Americans were singularly unimpressed with an early cut, there was a real chance that Slumdog would be stillborn.        
	However, now that Slumdog has won eight Oscars out of a possible nine, there are conflicting paternity claims. The eight Oscars  including best film, best director (Danny Boyle), best original score and song (both Rahman) and best sound mixing (Resul Pookutty and two others)  put Slumdog on level pegging with Richard Attenboroughs Gandhi.        
	Although Ashok Amritraj, the Hollywood producer, has conceded Slumdog is British, he added: This is unbelievable, awesome, a great moment for India.        
	Amritraj, who had been spot on in predicting Slumdog would sweep in an interview last week with The Telegraph, said: It should mean more co-productions between Hollywood and Bollywood.        
	The night was dominated by Slumdog  its nearest rival, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, managed only three Oscars from 13 nominations. The British actress Kate Winslet was named best actress for her performance in The Reader, as many thought she would be. Sean Penn upset the odds to win the best actor award, beating favourite Mickey Rourke.        
	There was a best supporting actor award for Heath Ledger for his role as the Joker in the Batman movie The Dark Knight  only the second time an acting Oscar has been given posthumously. It is not generally known he was Shekhar Kapurs discovery.        
	Slumdog Millionaires triumph, together with Kate Winslet winning best actress, is a fantastic achievement for the British film industry, said Brown. Last night was a great night for Britain. I would like to congratulate Danny Boyle and all those who worked on Slumdog.        
	Brown can also emphasise that the films central character, Jamal Malik, is played by Londoner Dev Patel.        
	The European Commission jumped on the bandwagon by pointing out that Slumdog was co-funded under a finance programme to support movie-making in Europe. It received a total of 730,000 from the EU fund towards distribution costs.        
	The American ownership of Slumdog was reflected in the Los Angeles Times. While the films triumphs marked an amazing outcome for a movie filled with subtitles, scenes of torture and a Bollywood dance sequence, the wins also cemented the reputation of distributor Fox Searchlight, which has become Hollywoods top advocate of the kind of daring works that movie studios have all but abandoned.        
	Although a tiny cog in Rupert Murdochs global News Corp media conglomerate, Fox Searchlight turned Slumdog into a solid box-office hit, with domestic gross set to pass $100 million.        
	Irrfan Khan, who plays a police inspector in Slumdog, drew attention to the Indian involvement in the movie. Slumdog is, in a true sense, a collaboration because you are using a sound recordist, first assistant director, co-director, background score and actors from India, he told The Telegraph.         
	He might also have added that the film is adapted from Q amp; A, a novel by serving Indian diplomat Vikas Swarup.        
	Swarup said today: It was a big night for India. Without Slumdog, would you have Bollywood dancing on an Oscar stage, with Indian drummers, and Rahman singing two songs in Hindi or Freida Pinto presenting an award? Last night marked Indias arrival on the world entertainment stage.

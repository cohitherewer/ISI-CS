	Bhopal, June 3: The burglar took away antiques and silver but left behind the spark for an old family feud.        
	A theft in the Gwalior royal palace has prompted the personal secretary to BJP MP Yashodhara Raje Scindia to point an accusing finger at the personal secretary to another Scindia, Yashodharas nephew and political rival Jyotiraditya.        
	On May 19, Yashodharas personal secretary Satish Jaiswal had filed a complaint of alleged burglary at Jai Vilas Palace. He listed 91 antiques and precious silver utensils as missing from the palace, run by a Scindia family trust.        
	Police officer Munish Rajoriya said he had now received another complaint from Jaiswal alleging that Vijay Phalke, personal secretary to Guna MP Jyotiraditya, was a suspect.        
	We have received one complaint from Satish Jaiswal, personal secretary of Yashodhara Raje, Rajoriya, station house in-charge of Jhansi Road police station, told The Telegraph. In the complaint, he has raised doubts about Vijay Phalke who could be behind the burglary at Jai Vilas Palace.        
	The investigating officer said he had sent a notice to Jaiswal asking him to give an estimated value of the stolen items.        
	On behalf of Jyotiraditya, Phalke had also moved an application on May 20, asking Rajoriya to investigate the burglary. He, however, did not submit any list of stolen items.        
	Both complaints said the items were stolen from the eastern portion of the palace  better known as Rani Mahal, where the late Rajmata Vijaya Raje Scindia used to stay.        
	Rajoriya said a case, based on the complaints filed on May 19 and 20, had been registered.        
	Supporters of Yashodhara said burglaries at the royal palace have been going on since February last year.        
	The matter is with the police, but we suspect that someone influential has been clandestinely selling these antiques, said a Gwalior resident.        
	While Rajoriya insists that the matter is being investigated just like any other burglary, Gwalior residents see it as an aunt-nephew feud coming out into the open.        
	The last few years have seen Yashodhara and Jyotiraditya locked in a fight for political turf, each claiming to be the inheritor of the Scindia legacy.        
	In the recent Assembly and parliamentary polls, Jyotiraditya had urged Gwalior ki praja to vote for the Congress. The voters, however, thought otherwise and elected Yashodhara as the city MP.        
	Aunt and nephew have also clashed over taking credit for development projects in Gwalior. In 2007, they crossed swords over a ropeway. Jyotiraditya had opposed the civic bodys move to install a 750-metre ropeway between Phool Bagh and Gwalior Fort on the ground that it would cause environmental damage to the fort.        
	Gwalior witnessed another Scindia versus Scindia when Union civil aviation minister Praful Patel visited the city with Jyotiraditya to inaugurate a Delhi-Gwalior-Bhopal flight.         
	In a letter to Somnath Chatterjee, the then Lok Sabha Speaker, Yashodhara wondered why Jyotiraditya was made guest of honour when he had nothing to do with Gwalior.        
	In Gwalior, the Scindias are known to possess a fortune. But in an interview, Yashodhara had said the Scindia wealth was like a bottle with a hole or a ship with a permanent leak in the ocean.

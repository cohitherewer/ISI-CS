          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 27: A mid-level official of Vedic Village was arrested today for alleged links with Gaffar Mollah, the wanted local tough whose capture could blow the lid off a can of worms.        
	Biplab Biswas, an assistant project manager in his mid-thirties, was taken into custody after police called him over for questioning this afternoon. Rahul Srivastava, the North 24-Parganas SP, said: We arrested him (Biswas) this afternoon.         
	A source in Vedic Realty, the promoters of Vedic Village, said Biswas had joined the company around five years ago. As an assistant project manager, he was in charge of land purchase and construction at the resort site.         
	We have learnt about Biswass arrest today for his links with Gaffar. We dont have any further details, said Raj K. Modi, the Vedic Realty chairman and managing director.         
	Over the past three days, the police have also questioned Modi, M.J. Robertson, the CEO of Vedic Village, and Rajiv Bhuiyan, the estate manager of the project.         
	We had questioned Biswas on Tuesday, too. Today, we summoned him again as we had got information about his links with Gaffar, said an officer.        
	Police sources said Abdul Hai alias Kalobabu, a Gaffar aide arrested during the day, spilled the beans on his leaders alleged association with Biswas.        
	During interrogation, Biswas broke down and admitted his links with Gaffar and we arrested him. He also admitted his involvement with Gaffar in forcefully acquiring land, the officer said.         
	Gaffar is still at large but we think that with the arrest of Biswas, we have moved closer towards catching him, said a senior officer. The police hope to make Gaffar sing on his connections once he is arrested.         
	Several Rajarhat residents who had sold land for the Vedic Village project had said Gaffar used to swing into action on the basis of information provided by Biswas.        
	As Biswas was dependent on Gaffars Mastan Bahini (army of toughs), he had told other employees of Vedic Village not to bother Gaffar, police sources said.         
	Whenever land purchase         
	hit a stumbling block, Gaffars services were sought A couple of months ago, Biswas had given 150 helmets and rods to Gaffar and his henchmen. Those were stored inside Vedic Village, said a 28-year-old youth who works in the resort.        
	On Monday, the police had found some helmets along with guns that the management said had been left by goons who took shelter there from a mob on Sunday.

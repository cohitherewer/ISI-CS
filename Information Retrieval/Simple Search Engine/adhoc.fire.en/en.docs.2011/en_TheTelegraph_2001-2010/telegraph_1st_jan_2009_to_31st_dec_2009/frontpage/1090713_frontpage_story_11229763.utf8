          OUR BUREAU                                            
	Calcutta, July 12: Jyoti Basu lost consciousness this morning and his pulse turned too feeble to be read but a cardiac massage by a nurse revived him within a few seconds at his Salt Lake residence.        
	The veteran CPM leader, who turned 95 on Wednesday, has been admitted to a private hospital, AMRI. An attending doctor told The Telegraph late tonight that the condition of Basu, under observation in a deluxe room in the ICCU, was stable.         
	His ECG and echocardiography tests were all right and his condition is stable now. He had vegetable clear soup for lunch, said the doctor.         
	The hospital has formed a seven-member medical board to look after Basu. Issuing a bulletin this evening, a hospital spokesperson said the former chief minister was comfortable, except for some fluctuations in blood pressure.         
	Hospital sources said Basu lost consciousness at the bathroom while brushing his teeth around 9.25am. The attending nurse was with him and she intervened before he could slump to the floor. She brought him to the adjacent room and placed him on the bed, said a doctor, adding that the nurse did not get any pulse beat initially.         
	His blood pressure was so low that it could not be recorded. Immediately, she started giving him cardiac massage and he regained consciousness within a few seconds, the doctor said.         
	Sources at Indira Bhavan, where Basu lives, said the leaders aide, Rabi, saw him collapsing and carried him to the bed and informed Madhabi Biswas, the attending nurse, about his illness. Madhabi, a temporary nurse at AMRI, has been looking after Basu for the past three months.         
	A cardiologist not associated with Basus treatment said an external cardiac massage is usually given when a paramedic cannot hear or feel heart sounds. The massage  which involves applying rhythmic pressure near the region of the heart using the heel of the hand  is intended to stimulate the heart to beat.        
	Both Rabi and the nurse did a good job and saved baba, said Rakhi, Basus daughter-in-law, who reached Indira Bhavan with her husband Chandan by 9.40am. Cardiologist Asim Bardhan was the next person to reach.         
	An ECG done at Basus house confirmed that his cardiac condition was stable. Although his pulse rate improved between 40 and 45 per minute, it was lower than his normal range of 60 to 65 per minute. He did not have any breathing problem either, said Chandan.         
	Critical care expert Rajiv Sil, who reached Basus residence after getting a call from Chandan, said: He was complaining about abdominal pain and we decided to shift him to the hospital.         
	Basu has a history of colitis and gastro-enteric disorder. According to an Indira Bhavan source, Basu had complained of abdominal discomfort last night.         
	The past few days were more than hectic for Basu, who otherwise leads a disciplined life. On his birthday, the former chief minister was awake till late into the night.        
	He also has a clot, which resulted from a head injury suffered when he fell in the bathroom in June 2008. A similar fall last September aggravated the clot.         
	His neurological condition is stable. Todays illness apparently has no connection with the clot. But we will perform a CT scan tomorrow to be sure, said neurologist Trishit Roy, part of the seven-member medical board.         
	According to preliminary diagnosis, he suffered an attack of syncope, a term for sudden loss of consciousness, because of reduced blood supply to the brain.         
	When a person is standing, the earths gravity pulls blood to the lower part of the body. But neuro receptors situated in the main arteries send a signal to the lower limbs and blood is squeezed back to the brain. With age, these lower limbs fail to squeeze. So if an elderly person like Basu stands for a long time, blood supply to the brain falls, a doctor said.        
	Chandan and Rakhi dont want him to return to Indira Bhavan after recovery. We have been regularly telling baba to stay with us. But he likes to remain independent and does not like to be a burden to us. But we want to take him with us, Rakhi said.        
	Several political leaders, such as Pranab Mukherjee, Salman Khursheed, Biman Bose and Somnath Chatterjee, visited him this evening after his condition stabilised. He spoke to me for a brief period. He was looking stable, said Chatterjee, who visited AMRI twice during the day.

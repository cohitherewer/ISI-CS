          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          A CRPF jawan at a school in Lalgarh. Picture by Amit Datta    
	Calcutta, April 30: Peace largely held its ground in Bengal on Round One  till polling was over and at the cost of some polling itself.        
	In the evening, a landmine blast killed three persons on election duty  a poll officer, his assistant and driver  in West Midnapore, one of the three Maoist-affected districts that went to the polls today. The impact of the explosion that caught their jeep was such that one body was torn to pieces.        
	Purulia and Bankura, the two other Maoist-hit districts, escaped more or less unscathed because voters stayed away from several booths, heeding the rebels poll boycott call and denying them an excuse to launch attacks.        
	Not a single voter turned up in 31 booths in the three constituencies of Jhargram (the seat straddles West Midnapore and Purulia districts), Purulia and Bankura.         
	A booth usually has around 1,000 voters: which means at least 31,000 people today chose  voluntarily or otherwise  not to vote. The total number of those who stayed away will be more as low turnout was reported in 65 other booths in the three seats.        
	However, the affected booths (96) account for less than 2 per cent of the total 6,150 booths in the three constituencies.        
	Compared with the rest of India, Bengal did brave the heat and preserve its reputation for turnout on the higher side, clocking between 60 per cent and 82 per cent in the 14 seats where voting took place today.        
	But preliminary estimates suggest that barring Darjeeling, none of the 14 crossed the turnout figures of 2004. The hill seat clocked 74 per cent, three notches above the turnout five years ago.        
	Purulia matched the 2004 figure of 70 per cent but Bankura slipped to 60 per cent from 68 per cent and Jhargram to 65-70 per cent from 77 per cent.        
	Sharp slides were seen in Alipurdaur (65 per cent from 80 per cent) and Jalpaiguri (70 from 80), probably because of a tribal boycott in the plains in response to clashes related to the hill demand for Gorkhaland.        
	Bengals first phase  two more rounds are scheduled in the rest of the state on May 7 and 13  was considered the most violence-prone because it covered the Maoist areas.         
	The state government credited security measures for the low level of attacks during polling.         
	Our government was worried till yesterday as we were anticipating violence of some measure in the three districts. But central forces and state police were on strict vigil and thats why no untoward incident occurred during the election, though there were some stray clashes. A small bomb explosion in Purulia injured a Border Security Force jawan, home secretary Ardhendu Sen said before the landmine explosion.        
	However, another official said: The CPI (Maoist) had given the call for an election boycott in Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore and had put up posters across the three districts. People living in these areas are in constant fear of Maoist attacks if they do not toe their line. Had the voters been overzealous, the Maoists would have unleashed terror to disrupt the election process.        
	In the Lalgarh and Salboni areas of the Jhargram Lok Sabha seat, the poll was boycotted in nine of the 19 booths.        
	In Lalgarh, the state government and the poll panel had agreed to conditions set by a resistance group and confined voting to four clusters. The arrangement did not succeed in drawing voters to the clusters.         
	It was surprising to find a 13 per cent turnout in the Lalgarh area, chief electoral officer Debashis Sen said, adding that the boycott call was the reason for the low figure.        
	Our top priority was to conduct secure and peaceful elections, especially in the Jangalmahal (a popular reference to the region). At the end of the day, we are satisfied, Sen said.        
	If the boycott call played a part, so did the lack of incentives. We supported the Maoist boycott call. Besides, we didnt get chire, muri and gur this time from a candidate who had done it in past elections before the day of polling, a voter said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | No race role in debate, says Obama

          JEFF ZELENY                            Obama during an interview with CNN in Washington. (AP)                                  
	Washington, Sept. 19: President Obama said yesterday that he did not believe his race was the cause of fierce criticism aimed at his administration in the contentious national debate over health care.        
	Instead, he said, the cause was a sense of suspicion and distrust many Americans have in their government. Are there people out there who dont like me because of race? Im sure there are, Obama told CNN. Thats not the overriding issue here.        
	In five separate television interviews at the White House, Obama said he did not agree with former President Jimmy Carters assertion that racism was fuelling the opposition to his administration.         
	He described himself as just the latest in a line of Presidents whose motives had been questioned because they were trying to enact major change.        
	Obama will appear on five Sunday talk shows  an unprecedented step for a President  to promote his health care plan. The television networks broadcast brief parts of their interviews last evening, all of which focused on a question the White House has sought to avoid all week: Has race played a role in the debate?        
	Obama, the nations first black President, said race is such a volatile issue in this society that he conceded it had become difficult for people to tell whether it was simply a backdrop of the current political discussion or a predominant factor.        
	Now there are some who are, setting aside the issue of race, actually I think are more passionate about the idea of whether government can do anything right, he told ABC News. And I think that thats probably the biggest driver of some of the vitriol.        
	The President spoke to anchors from three broadcast networks, ABC, CBS and NBC as well as the cable networks CNN and Univision. He conceded that many people were sceptical of the health care legislation making its way through Congress.

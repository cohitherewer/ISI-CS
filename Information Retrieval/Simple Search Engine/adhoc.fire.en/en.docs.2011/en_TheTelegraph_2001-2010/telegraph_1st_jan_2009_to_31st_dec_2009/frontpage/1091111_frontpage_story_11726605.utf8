          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 10: IIM aspirants appearing for the first computerised Common Admission Test (CAT) from November 28 to December 7 will need to arrive at the testing centre at least 90 minutes before the examination begins.        
	The business schools and testing service provider Prometric today issued a guidebook of rules and suggestions that candidates may need to master as much as math or vocabulary.         
	Each day for 10 days, two slots of tests will be held  one at 10am and the other at 3.30pm. Each student has been allotted one slot. The guidelines follow:        
	Arrive at the allocated test centre two hours before the scheduled start of the exam. Students will not be allowed to take the test if they arrive less than 90 minutes before the exam time.         
	Bring the CAT admit card, CAT voucher, photo-identity (drivers licence, passport, PAN card, voter ID, college ID, employee ID or notarised affidavit with photograph). If name has changed  because of marriage or divorce, for instance  candidates must bring relevant documents  such as a marriage certificate or divorce decree.         
	Staff wearing official CAT 2009 jackets will assist candidates.        
	On arrival, identity checks will be conducted. Once a candidates identity is verified, he or she will be escorted to a terminal.         
	Biometric fingerprinting will be done at check-in station, while an adjacent camera will take the candidates photograph.        
	Take a 15-minute tutorial on how to answer questions and navigate through the test.        
	Take the 2-hour, 15-minute test  consisting of a total of 60-70 questions to evaluate quantitative, verbal and logical and data analysis abilities. Rough paper will be provided for calculations and must be returned at end of the test.        
	Cannot get up from the terminal  even to visit the toilet, or if the candidate completes the test early  till the time is up.         
	Candidates can highlight text from a passage they are questioned on, in order to help answer the queries.         
	Candidates can use a mark button at the bottom of the screen to mark questions they wish to return to later  if they are unsure of the answers or are unable to answer these questions. Clicking on the question again will unmark it.        
	At any time during the test, students can go to a review screen that will allow them to see a list of all questions  to evaluate how many are answered, unanswered or marked.         
	An on-screen timer at the top right of the screen will count down from 2 hours and 15 minutes, showing the time left in the test.

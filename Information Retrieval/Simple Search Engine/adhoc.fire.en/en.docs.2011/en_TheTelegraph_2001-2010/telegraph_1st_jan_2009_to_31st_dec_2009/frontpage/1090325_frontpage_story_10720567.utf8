The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Weathered marshal deploys platoons
                                                                                                           Weathered marshal deploys platoons
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                             Sonia Gandhi                                  
	New Delhi, March 24: Where she sat today, despatching the first platoons in the defence of her untitled throne, is the cocoon of Sonia Gandhis many morphoses.         
	24 Akbar Road is no strange stage to her, but when she began, in the Indira era, she would have been no more than a casual, and unwilling, visitor to the green rooms. Even till a decade or so ago, she was merely an uncertain penumbra hanging over these premises, a baffling dowager of a lost kingdom, now playing reluctant Sphinx, now an interventionist pharaoh unwilling to let the clan vanish.         
	Until that mid-March morning in 1998. She had let Sitaram Kesri lead the Congress to ignominy in the elections, refusing to formally assume reins, or blame. Then shed sent the knives out for him.         
	A storm had swept into the 24 Akbar Road party headquarters and unveiled on Kesri the chronicle of his widely foretold death. Only, he wouldnt heed the story until it expelled him from the character cast, leaving him an actor without a stage, a president without a party. The nails had been yanked off his nameplate; a shining plaque embossed with Sonia Gandhis name had floated in and stuck itself outside the bosss room.               
	By the time Kesri arrived, his cask was already laid. All that his working committee had to do was to close the lid on it, the dark task of the Ides of March.         
	The party had to live; it was being returned to the Palace. It was a rite Congressmen performed with merry, and practised, prostration. The king is dead, long live the Queen. Sonia Gandhi! Soooniiia Gaaandhiii!!! went the frenzied chant.         
	The air at the coronation  consummated behind closed doors with flowers and, doubtless, dollops of flattery  was almost Peronesque. For a party gasping to survive, here was Saint Saviour. Our Lady of the Barricades of 10 Janpath, Propitiator of the Blessed Bloodless Coup. She was looking down from a dozen lofty cutouts, from a hundred posters suddenly sprung  here in a sari, hands folded, there in a salwar suit, hands raised in acknowledgement, face benevolently beaming.         
	She would forsake her benevolence and renounce the crown a year later  offended by Sharad Pawars Italian slur in the summer of 1999  but only for a trice, only to afford the faithful enough opportunity to fall at her feet again.         
	Not since the Emergency-era call of India is Indira, Indira is India had Congressmen savoured such wanton pangs of devotion as they did beseeching Sonia back to her crown at Delhis Talkatora Stadium that May a decade ago.         
	Swift to exploit the supine sentiment at the AICC, she sealed the debate over her origins and left nobody in doubt she was demanding, after the fashion of the mother-in-law, blind and complete personal loyalty.         
	Those who want to walk with me should do so with their heads and hearts, she told her contrite flock, Those who have even an iota of uncertainty are free to walk away. The domes of Talkatora were rent with protestations of faith; Sonia beamed again.         
	And there she still was this morning, on the marqueed lawns of 24 Akbar Road, beaming more than ever before. No longer lost for a kingdom, merely seeking to secure it yet again; her foot soldiers at the ready, arrows leaping off their bowstrings.         
	But here was a weathered marshal on show, tempered by the scars of past crusades won and lost, warned of the exigencies of the tests of the future. Her storm-troopers were in battle mode  Manmohan to the left of her, Priyanka to the right of her, volleying and thundering  but Sonia herself chose to survey the war ahead. The larger game and its possible requirements.         
	The adversary in her sights is no less formidable than it was in 2004, her flanks probably lie a little more eroded. The Left has split away and positioned itself in ambush. The trusted Lalu Prasad has pitched his own tent in Bihar. The battles getting tougher, the war even lonelier.         
	So make a national splash with the pocket-borough card; so what if Priyanka will only campaign in Amethi and Rae Bareli, she can make herself heard much beyond.         
	Today she did, mocking the BJP for lacking an agenda for India. And soften the blows on would-be friends. It was fair enough that Manmohan drove his knuckles deeper into Prakash Karat, but Sonia herself remained soft and silent on the Left  let the elections be over, well see.         
	For now, its just the battle. Sonia showed herself judicious enough to grasp this war will only be won, or lost, post-election. Shes come a long way to become enthroned empress of 24 Akbar Road, 10 Janpath is only its backroom and 7 Race Course its current and could-be front office.

  - Some decisions await PMs intervention          RASHEED KIDWAI                            Singh                                        
	New Delhi, Feb. 15: Manmohan Singh, recovering from bypass surgery at home, is being missed at South Block and Parliament at a time elections are just months away.        
	Sources said foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee  filling in for Singh in some respects  home minister P. Chidambaram and defence minister A.K. Antony were fulfilling their responsibilities with little cause for complaint.         
	Some important decisions, however, are on hold since the Prime Minister is not strong enough yet to come to office although he has been doing what he can from home  for instance, he today signed the interim budget that Mukherjee will unveil tomorrow.         
	The sources said Singh was doing fine and there was not an iota of worry over his health  just that his post-operative recovery has not been as fast as some Congress leaders had expected.        
	A generally tight-lipped Race Course Road has let on that Singhs frugal eating habits were posing a hurdle. The Prime Minister is apparently not eating as much solid food as his attendants would like him to.        
	In Singhs absence, the role of national security adviser M.K. Narayanan has blurred a bit, the sources said. Ever since Chidambaram replaced Shivraj Patil, the national security advisers role, crucial to foreign policy and internal security, has become a subject of speculation. Also, several ministers are keen on foreign trips before elections are called but these decisions are stalled for now.        
	The current stopgap arrangement, the sources said, is working fine but it is silent on the political authority to take such decisions. For instance, it does not specify if the foreign minister can clear the home ministers US visit.        
	Singhs hand is being missed in Kashmir too. The sources said that a few separatist leaders had sent feelers and were waiting for chief minister Omar Abdullah to invite them for talks before the melting snow offered militants a chance to spoil the atmosphere. Such an initiative from the state government, however, is improbable without Singhs supervision.        
	On the political plane, overworked ministers and ministerial aspirants are still hoping for a minor cabinet shuffle. With just a few months left of the governments term, the likes of Ghulam Nabi Azad are keen to take oath.        
	Besides, the ministries of information and broadcasting, coal, and environment and forests  all under Singhs direct charge  are without cabinet-rank ministers.         
	Junior foreign minister Anand Sharma has additional charge of I amp;B while the minister of state in the Prime Ministers Office, Prithviraj Chavan, is looking after the personnel department and several ministries under Singhs charge.        
	Initially, some UPA leaders were hopeful of seeing Singh in Parliament during the current session, which ends on February 26, though doctors had said he needed to take rest at least till the second week of March.

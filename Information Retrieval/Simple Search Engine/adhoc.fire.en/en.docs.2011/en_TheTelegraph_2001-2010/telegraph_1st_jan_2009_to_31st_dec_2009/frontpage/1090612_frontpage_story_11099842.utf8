	New Delhi, June 11: Get ready to work a whole week and another day extra next year.        
	Of the 17 holidays declared by the Union ministry of personnel for 2010, eight fall on the weekend.        
	So, Milad-un-Nabi, Mahavir Jayanti, Independence Day, Id-ul-Fitr, Mahatma Gandhis birthday, Dussehra, Guru Nanaks birthday and Christmas Day will not mean an extra holiday next year.        
	The best employees can hope for is a last-minute change in the dates of the Prophets birthday and Id, which depend on the sighting of the moon. If the moon is sighted early, the festivals might be celebrated on Friday instead of Saturday.         
	But there is no such hope for the remaining six holidays.        
	The 17 holidays declared by the ministry are for government offices in the national capital. Other than the eight which fall on the weekend next year, the holidays include Republic Day, Holi, Ram Navami, Good Friday, Buddha Purnima, Janmashtami, Diwali, Id-uz-Zoha and Muharram.        
	For central government employees outside Delhi, 14 holidays are common while the remaining three are chosen from a list of 12 festivals.        
	State governments have their own lists, which cover most of the holidays on the central government list and add some of their own. Private sector companies pick and choose from the government lists.        
	Bengal government employees, for instance, have to work on Ram Navami, Milad-un-Nabi, Buddha Purnima and Mahavir Jayanti. So they wouldnt care about Mahavir Jayanti and Milad-un-Nabi falling on the weekend. They would be unhappy about May Day and Navami both falling on a Saturday, since those are otherwise holidays in the state.        
	The state governments offices also stay shut on Saraswati Puja, Lakshmi Puja, Poila Baisakh and on four days during the Pujas, compared with only one day  Dussehra  in Delhi, taking the total number of holidays in Bengal in a year to 21.                    WRITTEN WITH PTI REPORTS

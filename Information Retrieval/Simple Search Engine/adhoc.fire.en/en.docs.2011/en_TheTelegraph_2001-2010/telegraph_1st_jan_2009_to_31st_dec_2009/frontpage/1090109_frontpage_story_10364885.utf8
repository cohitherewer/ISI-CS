The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | NSCN abducts officer, 5 jawans
                                                                                                           NSCN abducts officer, 5 jawans
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Guwahati, Jan. 8: Members of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah) allegedly kidnapped an Assam Rifles captain and five jawans along with their arms and ammunition at Zhamai in Nagalands Phek district today.         
	Lt Col Nirupam Bhargav, a defence spokesman in Kohima, confirmed the abduction and said Capt. Shapam Momo had gone to Zhamai from Pfutsero town on a routine patrol with the five jawans when they were overpowered by a large number of NSCN cadres.         
	He said the abducted persons were kept in the nearby NSCN (I-M) designated camp at Kopamedzu and that negotiations were on with the help of village elders to seek their release.         
	None of the NSCN (I-M) leaders were available for comment till late tonight. The defence spokesman said the Assam Rifles team could be overpowered as it had restrained itself in view of the ceasefire with the outfit.         
	The rebels, however, did not bother about the ceasefire ground rules and abducted the Assam Rifles personnel, he alleged.        
	The NSCN (I-M) had recently claimed to have arrested several people in connection with extortions, abductions and ransoms as part of a drive against antisocial elements in and around Dimapur, the commercial hub of Nagaland.        
	The information and publicity wing of the NSCN said many of the arrested persons were from its rival NSCN (Khaplang) faction who it later released.         
	This gesture is also to pave the way for the arrested NSCN (I-M) cadres by the rival group who are yet to be released.

          AMIT ROY                            Habits die hard                                  
	London, Nov. 15: India is heading for an epidemic of lung cancer, Siddhartha Mukherjee has warned in his much anticipated new book, Emperor of All Maladies.        
	Mukherjee, who is a doctor and a senior research academic attached to the Columbia University Cancer Centre, has pinned the blame firmly on tobacco companies which he accuses of dumping cigarettes on the Third World after being forced out of the First World.        
	To The Telegraphs response, Thats not good, Mukherjee gave what appeared to be a cynical laugh and agreed with equal understatement: Thats not good, yes.        
	He urged the occasion of his first interview about his book to urge a drastic change in the Indian governments smoking policy. It would be a tragedy for public health in India if that is not altered, he says.        
	Emperor of All Maladies, which the author has described as his attempt to demystify cancer by writing an intellectual and historical biography of the disease defining the modern age, is due to be published worldwide.        
	According to Mukherjee, the cancer epidemic which hit England in the 1970s before a vigorous campaign forced tobacco companies to retreat, is about to be re-enacted in India.        
	In England it was a real tragedy, actually, says Mukherjee, 39, who was a Rhodes scholar at Magdalen College, Oxford, after doing an undergraduate degree at Stanford and before going to Harvard Medical School.        
	Using well-funded public relations firms, the tobacco companies hit back hard by arguing that the government should not intervene on an issue of personal liberty. However, the campaign against them was led effectively by a lobby group called ASH. The result is that cigarette advertising is today banned from television and cinema, and packets have to carry the stark message, Smoking Kills.        
	Although smoking has not disappeared from the UK, it has fallen dramatically. Since it is no longer permitted in public spaces, it is now commonplace to see groups of office workers gathered outside buildings united in their desperation to have a quick fag.        
	It is true more young people are smoking in India, asserts Mukherjee. The tobacco industry has particularly targeted young men and women in the Third World as their new targets for smoking. As tobacco retreats away from the First World, it has found a very viable business model in the Third World. Usually there is a 30-year lag between that rise and the development of overt cancers. So we are just going to wait for the Indian epidemic of lung cancer.        
	He predicts that incidence of cancer in India will continue to rise. America is living in the age of cancer and developing countries are entering that age.        
	He warns repeatedly about the concerted and machinated effort by tobacco companies to move their business to developing countries.        
	He fears that the rise of smoking, particularly among young adults in India, will play itself out in lung cancer and a head and neck cancer epidemic, just as it did in the 1970s in England.        
	In his book, Mukherjee has written in very emotional language about what it meant for him as a young doctor to witness human suffering.        
	This was the tenth month of my Fellowship in Oncology  a two-year immersive medical training programme to become a cancer physician  and I felt as if I had gravitated to its lowest point, he recounts in Emperor of All Maladies. In those ten indescribably difficult months, dozens of patients in my care had already died. I was becoming slowly inured to the deaths and the desolation, vaccinated against the constant emotional brunt.        
	According to Mukherjee, the book tracks the story of Sidney Farber who accidentally discovered chemotherapy as we know it in 1948, actually collaborating with an Indian chemist, Yellapragandha Subharao  or Yella, who had come to Harvard in the 1930s. Through that discovery they started treating children with leukaemia in Boston in 1948.        
	Mukherjee is represented by Andrew Wylie, generally reckoned to be the most high-profile literary agent in America with a stable of successful authors that includes Salman Rushdie, V.S. Naipaul, Patrick French and Nandan Nilekani.        
	Mukherjee believes certain types of books, especially serious non-fiction, tend to struggle commercially in India but he himself has read The Calcutta Chromosome. Yes, I have  I am a big fan of Amitav Ghoshs work in general.        
	Part 1 of his book, entitled Blood, begins with a Sherlock Holmes quotation from A Study in Scarlet which suggests there might be a parallel between solving a crime and detecting the cause of cancer: In solving a problem of this sort, the grand thing is to be able to reason backwards. That is a very useful accomplishment, and a very easy one, but people do not practise it much.        
	Mukherjee is aware of the work of Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, one of three scientists recently awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry for their work on ribosomes, the molecular machines that make protein in cells, and for providing a better understanding of the functioning of human cells.        
	Ramakrishnan had left India for America at 19, Mukherjee at 18.        
	Professor Ramakrishnan works on a much more molecular level than I do but I follow the work peripherally and understand its relevance, observes Mukherjee.        
	He appeared not to be wildly enthusiastic about the claims of gurus such as Baba Ramdev who has not discouraged his disciples from promoting the view that some cancer patients have been cured by undertaking a course in yoga.        
	I am afraid I am not an expert on alternative medicine, Mukherjee responds cautiously. I would like to believe that somewhere in the enormity of alternative medicine there are things that modify cancer. I dont know and I suspect the answer is if there is something, we havent found it yet. It is worthwhile being humble about cancer medicine and cancer biology because there is so much we dont know but I dont think the answer is very obvious.        
	The heroes and heroines in Emperor of All Maladies draw an analogy between landing on the moon and fighting cancer.         
	Mukherjee says: Landing on the moon was the conquest of outer space. Cancer would be the conquest of inner space.

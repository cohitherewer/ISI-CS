	Los Angeles, Sept. 12: A multimillion-dollar collection of original work by famed Pop Art icon Andy Warhol was stolen last week from a Los Angeles home, police said today.        
	On September 3, a housekeeper for noted art collector Richard L. Weisman walked into the dining room of Weismans residence and saw that 11 large portraits that had been on the walls the day before were gone, according to Detective Donald Hrycyk, head of the Los Angeles Police Departments art theft detail.        
	The housekeeper called police, and investigators soon brought in Hrycyk, who has spent years chasing forgers and thieves in the shady art underworld. There was no sign of forced entry into the home and nothing else had been disturbed, including several other Warhol pieces on nearby walls, Hrycyk said.        
	Police have no immediate leads or suspects other than a vague description of a maroon-coloured van that, according to a witness, might have been in the driveway about the time of the theft. A $1-million reward has been offered by an anonymous source for information leading to the recovery of the paintings.        
	Weisman left the house the day before the housekeeper discovered the art missing, making it unclear exactly when the theft occurred, police said. The former investment banker comes from a renowned family of collectors.         
	His parents, Frederick and Marcia, were important figures in art circles, amassing a significant collection that centered on works by post-World War II artists. Though not considered by collectors to be examples of Warhols best work, The Athletes series is well-known. I commissioned him to do this set of athletes because the worlds of art and sports dont mesh that well, Weisman said.

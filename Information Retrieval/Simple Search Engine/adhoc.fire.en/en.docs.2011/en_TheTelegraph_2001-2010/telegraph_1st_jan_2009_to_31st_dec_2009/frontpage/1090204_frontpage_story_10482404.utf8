The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Cop claims victory over red outfit
                                                                                                           Cop claims victory over red outfit
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranchi, Feb. 3: Ranchi senior superintendent of police (SSP) Sampat Meena at a news conference today claimed that a police operation undertaken yesterday had wiped out Jharkhand Liberation Tigers, better known as Peoples Liberation Front of India (PLFI).         
	Meena said that on Monday two teams of police led by Mandar officer in charge Sailesh Kumar and Chanho police officer in charge Ram Pravesh managed to ambush the outfits cadre successfully.        
	The teams allegedly arrested a top brass of the outfit and two members in a long-range patrolling operation. The PLFI is feared throughout Chanho, Khelari, Mandar and Burmu zones and thrives mainly on extortion bids.         
	According to Meena, on the night of February 2 the two patrolling parties had camped at a Bacho school after Ranchi (rural) superintendent of police Kuldip Dwivedi received a tip-off regarding the presence of a group of PLFI rebels, reportedly led by area commander Panna Yadav hiding in neighbouring jungles.        
	Soon an action plan was chalked out and the force ambushed the cadre at Seraitoli. Md Javed, Basudeo Oraon, and Panna Yadav were arrested with a cache of arms. Meena added that on earlier occasions, 18 rebels of the outfit were put behind bars and a cache of arms were also seized thus leading to the end.

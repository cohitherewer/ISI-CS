The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Job axe in family saga
                                                                                                           Job axe in family saga
          RASHEED KIDWAI                            Mahendra Singh Chauhan (top) , Arjun Singh                                 
	New Delhi, May 2: Arjun Singhs ministry has sacked the head of a national body for teachers training two months before his term expired, allegedly without citing an official reason.        
	National Institute of Technical Teachers Training and Research chairman Mahendra Singh Chauhan, an Arjun loyalist for decades, told The Telegraph he had campaigned for the Congress candidate who was up against Arjuns daughter Veena in Sidhi, Madhya Pradesh.        
	Chauhan said a fax from Ashok Thakur, additional secretary in Arjuns human resource development (HRD) ministry, had reached his office at 5.45pm yesterday. Within minutes, my office was sealed as if I had committed some crime. The letter did not explain why my services were being terminated.        
	Arjun was not available for comment and on a Saturday, no senior official could be reached in his ministry either.        
	Sources claimed Chauhan faced no allegations of financial irregularities or mismanagement. One possible reason could be that since he is a political appointee  having been appointed on June 24, 2004, soon after Arjun had become minister  he was being removed before the governments term ended. But in that case, he should have been quietly asked to step down without being humiliated, the sources said.        
	A tearful Chauhan said: Dau saheb (Arjun) could have asked me to step down and I would not have hesitated a minute. Why has he chosen to heap humiliation on a lesser mortal like me? I have been disgraced because I chose to be with the Congress. I think he owes me an answer.        
	When Veena was denied a Congress ticket and became an Independent candidate, Arjun had publicly hit out at the party. He was sent to Madhya Pradesh to campaign for Congress candidates, including Veenas rival Inderjeet Patel, but largely avoided electioneering.        
	Chauhan said he had campaigned for the Congress in Sidhi. This is what I have been doing all my life. But after a few days, I received feelers (not to) campaign against an Independent. When I laughed, pointing out that my mentor (Arjun) was himself a staunch Congress supporter, I was threatened with dire consequences.        
	Arjun addressed a Congress rally at Sidhi on April 21, the last day of the campaign, for three minutes. He did not name the Congress candidate.

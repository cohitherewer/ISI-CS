The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Loan behind Lanka gesture
                                                                                                           Loan behind Lanka gesture
          K.P. NAYAR                            Rajapaksa                                  
	Washington, April 27: Sri Lankas President Mahinda Rajapaksa ordered security forces to end the use of heavy calibre guns, combat aircraft and aerial weapons which could cause civilian casualties to secure smooth approval of a $1.9-billion loan from the International Monetary Fund.        
	The loan will, among other things, speed up post-conflict recovery efforts in areas once controlled by the Tamil Tigers.        
	Last weekend, Duvvuri Subbarao, the RBI governor, was pledging support here for the IMFs vision of Sri Lanka, post-Velupillai Prabhakaran, even as two Indian envoys were attempting in Colombo to salvage 39 Lok Sabha seats for the UPA by dousing anger in Tamil Nadu over Rajapaksas domestic military offensive.        
	Contrary to claims by home minister P. Chidambaram today that we have exerted pressure on Colombo, Subbarao assured the IMF and its financial committee in Washington that as normalcy returns in Sri Lanka, optimism about a resumption of the high growth trajectory and a step-up in the development process is gaining ground.        
	In plain language, the RBI governor was telling the IMF as it is about to sanction its biggest-ever loan to Lanka that the decimation of the LTTE was a hopeful signal for the economic future of the island and needs to be supported.        
	The irony of Subbaraos statement here is not only that it was delivered as national security adviser M.K. Narayanan and foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon were presumably forcing Rajapaksa into being nice to Tamils in his country, using leverage that the UPA government long ago surrendered to western powers and Japan.        
	According to IMF officials here and the Indian embassy, the statement was actually delivered on behalf of Chidambaram, who could not attend the half-yearly meeting in Washington because of electioneering in Tamil Nadu.        
	The fact is India is at a loss on how to deal with Rajapaksa, who is turning out to be smarter than Junius J.R. Jayawardene, known in his time as President as old fox because no one could outsmart him.        
	Even as his government is negotiating with the IMF, Rajapaksa has arranged a separate $500-million loan facility from Libya. The oil-rich Islamic country has a stake in protecting the islands large Muslim community from internal strife.        
	Heady from twin victories  the military success against the long festering sore of the LTTE and a sweeping mandate for his policies in the islands western provincial elections yesterday  Rajapaksa today asserted that the Tamil Tigers last lines in its final chapter are being writ.        
	He, therefore, announced that combat operations have reached their conclusion and asked security forces to end the use of heavy weapons that could cause casualties among civilians.

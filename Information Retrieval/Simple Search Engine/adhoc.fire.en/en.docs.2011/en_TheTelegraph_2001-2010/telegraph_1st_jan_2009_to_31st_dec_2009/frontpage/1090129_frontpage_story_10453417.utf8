The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Potter star to guide, for Obama kids 
                                                                                                           Potter star to guide, for Obama kids 
                                Radcliffe as Harry Potter in Half-Blood Prince                            
	London, Jan. 28: Daniel Radcliffe is the latest star to offer to entertain Barack Obamas daughters Malia and Sasha.         
	As their parents danced at 10 different inaugural balls in Washington DC, Malia and Sasha Obama spent their first night in the White House, and quickly learned the perks of being First Daughters.        
	At the end of a scavenger hunt around their new house, the girls and their school friends were thrilled to find The Jonas Brothers, the Grammy-nominated pop group, hiding at the end in the East Room. Theyve also been invited to meet Hannah Montana.         
	But in perhaps the biggest coup of all, now the daughters of the US President have the chance to meet Harry Potter. Radcliffe, the British actor who plays the boy wizard, has offered to show the First Daughters around Hogwarts.         
	Id like to take this opportunity to issue a public invitation to the Obamas that if their daughters would like a private tour of the Harry Potter set, I would be honoured to be their personal tour guide, Radcliffe has told The Daily Beast website.        
	Radcliffe also turned political commentator, saying he was proud and happy for the US, dubbing Obama both Martin Luther King and JFK (John F. Kennedy).

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Space station nears end
                                                                                                           Space station nears end
          JOEL ACHENBACH                            The International Space Station                                  
	Washington, July 13: A number of times in recent weeks a bright, unblinking light has appeared in the night sky of Americas capital: a spaceship. Longer than a football field, weighing 296,649kg, the spaceship moved swiftly across the heavens and vanished.         
	The International Space Station is by far the largest spacecraft ever built by earthlings. Circling the Earth every 90 minutes, it often passes over North America and is visible from the ground when night has fallen but the station, up high, is still bathed in sunlight. After more than a decade of construction, it is nearing completion and finally has a full crew of six astronauts. The last components should be installed by the end of next year.         
	And then?         
	In the first quarter of 2016, well prep and de-orbit the spacecraft, says Nasas space station programme manager, Michael T. Suffredini.         
	That is a polite way of saying that Nasa will make the space station fall back into the atmosphere, where it will turn into a fireball and then crash into the Pacific Ocean.         
	It will be a controlled re-entry, to ensure that it doesnt take out a major city. But itll be destroyed as surely as a Lego palace obliterated by the sweeping arm of a suddenly bored kid.         
	This, at least, is Nasas plan, pending a change in policy. There is no long-term funding on the books for international space station operations beyond 2015. Suffredini raised some eyebrows when, at a public hearing last month, he declared flatly that the plan is to de-orbit the station in 2016.         
	He addressed his comments to a panel chaired by former aerospace executive Norman Augustine that is charged by the Obama administration with reviewing the entire human spaceflight programme.         
	Everything is on the table  missions, goals, rocket design. And right there in the mix is this big, fancy space laboratory circling the Earth from 354km up.         
	The cost of the station is both a liability and, paradoxically, a virtue.         
	A figure commonly associated with the ISS is that it will ultimately cost the US and its international partners about $100 billion. That may add to the political pressure to keep the space laboratory intact and in orbit rather than seeing it plunging back to Earth so soon after completion.

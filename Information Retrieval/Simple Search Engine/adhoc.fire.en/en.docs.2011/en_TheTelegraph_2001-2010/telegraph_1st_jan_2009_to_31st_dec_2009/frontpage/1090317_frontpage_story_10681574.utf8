	New Delhi, March 16: Voters willing, the historic blunder might yet become history.        
	The CPM today did not rule out participating in a non-BJP, non-Congress central government, 13 years after refusing to let Jyoti Basu head just such a ministry as Prime Minister.        
	Hopefully, if a situation develops, our central committee will meet. We will see the situation, take stock of it and decide the question, party chief Prakash Karat told reporters here, not entirely shutting the door.        
	The general secretary, who was releasing the party manifesto, had been asked if the CPM might be willing to join a non-Congress, non-BJP government after the elections.        
	In case the third front can form the government and the CPM joins it  which still looks remote  the party will be missing one huge asset it had had in 1996  Basu himself whom, at 94, the CPM still considers its biggest vote-catcher.        
	Its ironic that Karats statement comes on a day the Bengal Left, after failing to get an ailing Basu to a rally at Calcuttas Salt Lake Stadium, played videotapes of his speech on the giant screens in apt reflection of the patriarchs still larger-than-life image.         
	Karat was one of the hard-liners at the central committee meeting of May 13-14, 1996, who stopped Basu from becoming Prime Minister  a decision Basu later dubbed a historic blunder.        
	Party sources said joining the government remained unlikely even now, but Karats remarks could reopen an old debate in the party.        
	Heres a look at the past churnings and divisions in the CPM on a subject on which its basic position remains that the party will join a government where it can play a role in determining the policies and getting them implemented too:        
	May 1996: On May 11, then CPM general secretary Harkishan Singh Surjeet told the party that the United Front  a conglomeration of mainly regional parties  wanted the CPM to join the government with Basu at the helm. The Congress was ready to support it from outside. Surjeet was all for joining.        
	On May 13, the central committee rejected the proposal, with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, Hannan Mollah and M.A. Baby among those who backed the Surjeet line and Biman Bose, Anil Biswas, E.K. Nayanar and V.S. Achuthanandan among those who blocked it.        
	When Surjeet and Basu conveyed the decision to the United Front, the allies led by former Prime Minister V.P. Singh requested the CPM to reconsider. The central committee met again on May 14 and reaffirmed its earlier decision by a 27-22 vote, with Surjeet coming under flak.        
	However, because of the split in opinion, the CPM decided to debate the issue at its 1998 Calcutta congress. The political organisation report of the conference spelt out both views. The arguments in favour of joining the government were:        
	The 1967 central committee resolution against joining a central government was based on the understanding that capitalism is collapsing and socialism is becoming a decisive factor. But this understanding proved to be wrong.        
	Twelve parties wanted Basu as Prime Minister. Their request was made out of the respect in which our party is held and our record in West Bengal.        
	A Prime Ministers great powers would have strengthened the fight against the BJP.        
	But the majority view was against this. One argument highlighted the fundamental difference between joining a state government and joining a Union government.        
	In a government with bourgeois parties in the majority, its difficult to implement alternative polices, this view said, adding that a communist Prime Minister unwilling to promote the policies of liberalisation would have hastened the governments fall.        
	Joining the government would have weakened the strength of the Left to fight communal forces.        
	Besides, so much energy would be lost keeping the coalition together that the partys growth would have been affected.        
	May 2004: The party this time discussed joining the Congress-led UPA government. One argument in support was it would strengthen a secular government. But the CPM opted out again with Karat still against joining.        
	Joining the government would have meant the party becomes part of a Congress-led alliance. (It) would have done violence to the partys political line as formulated in the 17th Congress, Karat wrote in party mouthpiece Peoples Democracy.        
	It would have blurred the identity of the party as an independent force representing the interests of the working class and turned the CPM into the Congresss junior partner.        
	Today Karat was speaking about a non-BJP, non-Congress government like the one in 1996 and unlike the one in 2004. But the 1998 party congress had found little difference between the two.        
	The United Front continued to pursue virtually the entire framework of the economic policies of liberalisation, the CPM had noted. The whole thrust of the Congress (I)s economic policy was being continued.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Crores for seat spill from nominee mouth
                                                                                                           Crores for seat spill from nominee mouth
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, March 28: The Telengana Rashtra Samiti candidate for Secunderabad announced on camera last evening that he had bought the Lok Sabha ticket for Rs 10 crore, landing his party in the eye of a storm and himself in hospital.        
	S. Venkat Reddy, a realtor who made his money during the 2005-07 real estate boom, thought he was among friends at Telengana Bhavan when he let slip that he had paid to get the seat. But word spread, and when TV journalists arrived to confirm the news, Venkat said on camera: Yes, I have paid money to the party to get the ticket.        
	Aspirants already angry at being left out of the fourth list of candidates, released yesterday, erupted. S. Rambabu, one of them, and his supporters thrashed Venkat and chased him out of the office. He is in hospital with leg injuries.        
	Venkat today denied he had bought the seat that includes the better part of metropolitan Hyderabad, including the upscale Banjara Hills and Jubilee Hills.         
	The charge is ridiculous. I only confided that I had made contributions to the party fund and not to leaders individually, he said in hospital.         
	But party workers were not buying the claim. A huge number gathered at the TRS headquarters in Banjara Hills, demanding an explanation, amid allegations that many more had paid for tickets.        
	The workers burnt an effigy of TRS chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao, who could not move around because of the protests. Women workers covered the face of a statue of Telengana Talli (Mother Telengana) at the party office, saying: Telengana Talli would be ashamed to see the happenings around her.        
	The Election Commission has issued notices to Rao and Venkat, the chief electoral officer said this evening.        
	Rao could not be reached for comment. Allies Telugu Desam, CPM and the CPI, who had left 9 of the 42 Lok Sabha seats and 48 of the 294 Assembly seats to the TRS, also would not comment.        
	Another realtor alleged he had paid Rs 7 crore for the Serilingampally Assembly seat but didnt get the ticket. Supporters of yet another aspirant, N. Venkateswarlu, who allegedly paid a huge sum but did not get the Bhupalapalli seat, ransacked the home of MP Vinod Kumar, accusing him of making the deal but not delivering. The MP should now pay us back with interest as he has kept the money for over six months, a supporter said.         
	Similar demands for repayment have come from aspirants for the Zaheerabad Lok Sabha seat and the Jedcherla and Gajwel Assembly seats.         
	Rao today decided to contest from Medak. Actress Vijayshanti has been proposed for Mahbubnagar, which Rao was expected to contest.         
	The allegation that seats were being sold also hit Chiranjeevis Praja Rajyam Party, whose workers today ransacked offices in Anantpur, Warangal and Vijayawada.

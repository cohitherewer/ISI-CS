          OUR BUREAU                               
	New Delhi, June 17: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, an advocate of stern action against Naxalism, is learnt to have taken a grim view of the violent Maoist takeover of Lalgarh and of the Left Front governments inability to restore law and order in the area.        
	Home minister P. Chidambaram put the ball in the court of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee ahead of the chief ministers meeting with the Prime Minister on Friday. Now it is the judgement the chief minister must make, Chidambaram said, driving home the need to reclaim Lalgarh from the Maoists.        
	The primary responsibility, sources in Delhi underlined, lay with the state government which must act before it is too late.         
	Although not specific to Lalgarh, the Prime Minister held out a stern warning to Naxalite activists at large on his flight back from the BRIC summit in Yekaterinburg, saying: Its a great threat to our policy, its seriousness is fully recognised and appreciated by our government. The home minister has some good ideas. we have plans, we will take effective action.         
	The Prime Minister did not elaborate on what those plans entailed, but left little doubt that a comprehensive anti-Naxalite offensive directed at their bases in many states was on the anvil.        
	On his part, Chidambaram exhorted chief minister Bhattacharjee to act swiftly.        
	In a loaded shot at the Left government, Chidambaram said: The impression is that one side of the government is willing to take action, the other side of the government is worried about the consequences. Now it is the judgement the chief minister must make.        
	The unequivocal statement came on a day the Left government, unable to take a decision on its own after dithering for over eight months, was looking towards the Centre to share some of the burden of unpalatable decisions an operation will require.        
	The Centre today sent four units (about 120 personnel in all) of its elite Cobra Force to Lalgarh but the Union home minister again underscored the need for the state government to scramble forces.        
	The home ministry told Bengal that the primary responsibility of restoring law and order lay with the state police and the state government should deploy its forces in full strength according to needs of the situation.         
	However, officials in Delhi said reports from the ground indicated that the state government was shying away from action and not sending state police forces to the so-called liberated zone. We were told that the police have been instructed to only resort to mild lathi-charge, said a central officer.        
	The officer said the reports he received suggested that state police might not venture into Lalgarh for another two days. Delhi sent five companies of the CRPF to Lalgarh from Sindri in Jharkhand yesterday. But paramilitary forces are mandated to act solely under the command of state police, and not using them was nullifying the whole idea of sending them, sources said.

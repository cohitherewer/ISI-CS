                                                                                                           Power rate goes up
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                              
	Calcutta, July 28: Your monthly electricity bill will go up with retrospective effect from April 1, this year, if your consumption is above 200 units.        
	The West Bengal Electricity Regulatory Commission (WBERC) today passed the tariff order for 2009-10, increasing the average electricity charge per unit by 18.50 paise for CESC customers and by 14 paise for West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd.        
	But the state government will absorb the burden following the rate hike on households consuming up to 200 units a month. In other words, households consuming up to 200 units a month  between 84 per cent and 90 per cent of users fall in this category  wont have to pay anything more.        
	The increase in monthly bills for households consuming 200 units a month will be Rs 33 in the CESC command area and Rs 27 to Rs 28 in WBSEDCL area. In order to spare consumers, the government will give the utilities around Rs 125 crore.        
	The energy charge for WBSEDCL consumers has been increased to Rs 5.96 from Rs 5.81 per unit above the first 300 units of consumption.         
	For commercial consumers, such as shops, the average hike is 14 paise per unit for WBSEDCL customers and 17 paise per unit for CESC customers.         
	High-voltage energy users, such as industrial units, will have to pay 21 paise more per unit of electricity if they are drawing energy from CESC, while the rise is between 11 paise and 18 paise for WBSEDCL consumers.         
	However, the regulatory panel has noted in its order that 1 per cent additional discount on energy cost be given to pre-paid meter users who were last year given a discount of 2 per cent. A WBERC official said the move was aimed at popularising pre-paid meters.

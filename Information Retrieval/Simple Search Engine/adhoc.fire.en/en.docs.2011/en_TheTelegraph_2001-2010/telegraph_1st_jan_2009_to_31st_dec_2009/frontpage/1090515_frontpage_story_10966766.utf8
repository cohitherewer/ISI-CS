The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Maoist hostages rescued
                                                                                                           Maoist hostages rescued
          VISHVENDU JAIPURIAR                              
	Hazaribagh, May 14: A joint team of police and CRPF personnel drawn from Ranchi, Chatra, Hazaribagh and Ramgarh today rescued three abducted railway employees after raiding suspected Maoist hideouts in Hendegiri.        
	Around 3.15am today station master Lalit Prasad and assistant station masters Sunil Kumar and Anil Kumar were rescued from Hingwahitand forests.         
	Police superintendent Pankaj Kamboj confirmed the rescue and added that the manager of Siddharth Construction Company, Bablu Singh, who was abducted yesterday, was also released by Maoists and was found safe and sound near Garuwa in Keredari this evening.         
	Yesterday, a rebel group associated with Tritiya Prastuti Committee, a breakaway faction of CPI(Maoist), kidnapped six railway staff, later releasing three.         
	Narrating their harrowing tale of captivity, Lalit said the abductors forced them to walk for kilometres through dense forests to meet their superiors.         
	The men told me that it could take two hours or 10 before we would be allowed to go back to the station, Lalit told The Telegraph while in Kambojs office.         
	Explaining the details of the rescue operation, Kamboj said it started from the exit points that were connected with Ranchi, Chatra, Ramgarh and Hazaribagh monitored by inspector-general (operation) D.K. Pandey.         
	Around 3:15am, a team, led by assistant sub-inspector S.S. Mishra, spotted a few men while they were close to Salga village. Without any warning, the rebels opened fire at them. The police retaliated cautiously to safeguard the hostages.        
	Though the situation became chaotic with a number of men running helter-skelter in the dark, the policemen spotted the hostages in their white shirts in a nearby field.

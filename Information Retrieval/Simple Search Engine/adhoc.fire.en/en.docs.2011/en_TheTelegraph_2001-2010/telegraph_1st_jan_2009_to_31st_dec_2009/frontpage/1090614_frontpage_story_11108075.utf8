	Hyderabad, June 13: Sania Mirzas engagement was an eyewash  she is already married and is a mother of two.        
	If you believe the Andhra Pradesh governments civil supplies department, that is.        
	According to a ration card issued by the department, the Hyderabadi tennis star is married to one Lakshmi Narayana from Vepadu town in Vizianagaram, near Visakhapatnam. The couple have two children and their family business is trading.        
	The saving grace for Sania is that although its her photo on the card, the name is given as Prasanna Lakshmi.        
	The state civil supplies minister, Jupally Krishna Rao, brought this to the notice of chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy during a review of the public distribution system at the secretariat this morning.        
	Sanias family was not amused. Imran Mirza said his daughter, who is playing in England and appears to have struck form in the run-up to Wimbledon, should not be distracted with such silly things.        
	The minister told reporters that the states population, calculated from ration card data, would be 9.8 crore although the actual figure was 8.5 crore.        
	The state issues white ration cards to below-poverty-line (BPL) families and pink cards to the rest. The bogus cards are mostly white cards, which bring the benefits of Rs 2-a-kg rice, the Indiramma scheme for subsidised housing, and the Aarogyasree healthcare and insurance scheme.        
	Minister Rao said nearly 1.8 crore white ration cards were in existence, showing a BPL population of 6.7 crore whereas the actual number of BPL people in the state was less than 4 crore.        
	The state government spends about Rs 3,500 crore annually on the Rs 2-a-kg rice scheme (which provides for 25kg per family of five), Rs 1,325 crore on the Aarogyasree scheme and Rs 5,000 crore on the Indiramma scheme.

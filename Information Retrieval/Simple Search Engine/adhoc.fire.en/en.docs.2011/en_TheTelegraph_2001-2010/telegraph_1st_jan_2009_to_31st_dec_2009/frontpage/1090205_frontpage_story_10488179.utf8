The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | DC says he wasnt informed
                                                                                                           DC says he wasnt informed
          AMIT GUPTA                               
	Ranchi, Feb. 4: Chatra DC Alok Goel, whose absence at the January 31 review meeting sparked an angry outburst from P. Chidambaram against the state chief secretary, has said he wasnt asked to attend the proceedings chaired by the Union home minister.        
	Chatra, one of two districts chosen as a pilot for centrally sponsored welfare schemes to win over villagers tormented by Maoist terror, was represented by Goels predecessor Puja Singhal Purwar who served as DC there for 10 months.         
	As reported in The Telegraph yesterday, this provoked a somewhat angry response from Chidambaram who ticked off chief secretary A.K. Basu for not opposing out of turn and ad-hoc bureaucratic transfers when he was told that those were done at the behest of former chief minister Shibu Soren.        
	I was not called to attend the meeting and so there arises no question of attending the same, Goel told The Telegraph over telephone from Chatra.         
	The chief secretarys office maintained he (Goel) had applied for leave till January 28 on account of his fathers illness. Moreover, January 31 (Saturday) was a government holiday due to Basant Panchami (Saraswati Puja).         
	District administration sources based in Chatra confirmed deputy development commissioner B. Murmu hoisted the tricolour on January 26 at the district collectorate as Goel was away.         
	Norms suggest that a DC needed to okay his leave from his immediate superior, ie divisional commissioner, in writing and also keep the chief secretary informed in case he left the headquarters town.         
	North Chotanagpur (Hazaribagh headquartered) commissioner A.K.Pandey, under whose jurisdiction Chatra falls, refused to elaborate on the controversy but added that he would be sending a detailed report to Ranchi soon.        
	Palamau, the other district where centrally sponsored schemes were in operation, was represented by its DC Amitabh Kaushal. No wonder the absence of the Chatra DC was noticed.        
	But the mystery over his absence continues.         
	Did the office of the chief secretary try to get in touch with Goel even though he was on leave?         
	And when exactly did Basu decide to ask Purwar, now director, secondary education in the state HRD department, to attend the meeting and brief the Union minister when called to?        
	Neither Basu nor his office would comment.

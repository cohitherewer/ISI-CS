  Partyless species under threat          OUR BUREAU                                                    
	April 14: They are drawn to the election fray like kids to candies, often vastly outnumbering party-affiliated candidates. Then they return to oblivion for another five years, licking their wounds, their deposits lost.        
	These are the Independent candidates, made famous by the Dharti Pakads, who, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh feels, are mere spoilers who should not be voted for.         
	Independents will be spoilers. I would like to tell the people of Mumbai to be careful not to encourage Independent candidates. They are spoilers and they will not win an election, the Prime Minister had said in Mumbai yesterday.        
	Mumbai has its fair share of Independent candidates, such as Meera Sanyal, the country head of ABN Amro Bank, who is fighting against the Congress Milind Deora. Among the other Independents are danseuse Mallika Sarabhai (Gandhinagar) and former Air Deccan boss Captain Gopinath (Bangalore South).        
	Some who havent got party tickets have also opted to be Independents, such as former defence minister George Fernandes (Muzaffarpur) and Veena Singh (Sidhi in Madhya Pradesh), the daughter of Congress leader Arjun Singh.        
	Sanyal said the Prime Ministers remark was a sign that Independents were getting the attention they deserved. I respect Manmohan Singh as a Prime Minister and an economist. I am not a destabilising force, and I am contesting the election for what I believe in. This is a democracy, and every one has a right to contest.         
	Agreed Sarabhai.        
	Democracy is all about people. But in our parliamentary democracy everything has been hijacked by the political parties and the people have been left to fend for themselves. So Independent candidates like me have an important role to play  to liberate and reform democracy, said Sarabhai, who is taking on Advani from the affluent Gujarat constituency.         
	Independent candidates claim they are not trying to be political leaders but are trying to offer alternative leadership outside the corrupt, dynastic and criminalised parties.        
	The candidates may be indignant but statistics from past polls show that Independents have scarcely made any dent in elections. The sole exception has been in Jharkhand where a bunch of Independents led by Madhu Koda did succeed in forming and running a government for almost two years, propped up ironically by the Prime Ministers Congress party.         
	As many as 37,440 Independent candidates  B.R. Ambedkar arguably the most illustrious of them all  have participated in the past 14 general elections since Independence. However, only 214 of them  less than one per cent  could make it to Parliament while 36,573 lost their deposits.         
	Over 90 per cent of Independent candidates forfeit their deposits every election. The deposit (now Rs 10,000) is forfeited if the candidate gets less than one-sixth of the valid votes polled. In 2004, only 15 Independent candidates could retain their deposits, while 2,370 lost the amount.        
	The first Lok Sabha election had 37 Independent MPs, the number swelling by five in the 1957 poll. But since then, there has been a gradual decline (see chart). In the first phase this year, of the 1,715 candidates in the fray, 124  or 13.83 per cent  are Independents.        
	Pollster Yogendra Yadav agrees with Sarabhai that Independent voices need to be heard. With the consolidation of political parties, Independents lose their chances and roles. It has happened all over the world, and it is happening here too. There are genuine Independent voices that need to be taken to account, but sadly they are not, he said.         
	Journalist Inder Malhotra, a veteran of many elections, recalled: In the first election, the slogan was Independent India and vote for Independents. There existed pocket boroughs, which over the years have given way to the political parties. Now there are many political parties and some of them even have less than five members.         
	What draws these candidates to fighting elections and forfeiting deposits? Some genuinely want to get their voices heard, a few are disgruntled rebels whose sole aim is to queer the pitch for their erstwhile partys nominee, many are attracted by the fame and headlines they make.         
	Kaka Joginder Singh, the Bareilly textile owner who fought and lost over 300 polls and was the original Dharti Pakad, used to be nonchalant every time he lost his deposit, saying it was his humble contribution to the national fund.        
	Kaka, who died in 1998 after taking on BJP stalwarts Atal Bihari Vajpayee (Lucknow) and L.K. Advani (Gandhinagar) that year, spawned a trail of Dharti Pakads. Mohan Lal, a cloth merchant from Bhopal, contested elections against five different Prime Ministers and lost his deposit every time. Nagarmal Bajoria has till date contested from over 278 constituencies and used donkeys for campaigning in an election. In 2004, Bajoria fought from Patna, Bhagalpur, Chandi Chowk (New Delhi) and Lucknow.        
	K. Padmarajan, a businessman from Mettur in Tamil Nadu, is another who loves to lose against political heavyweights. He found an entry in the 2003 Limca Book of Records having contested against President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, his predecessor K.R. Narayanan, former Prime Ministers P.V. Narasimha Rao and Vajpayee and former Tamil Nadu chief minister J. Jayalalithaa.         
	Independents with names similar to the main candidates are also fielded to confuse the voters and this is especially common in Kerala. The Congress candidate from Alappuzha, V.M. Sudheeran, lost by less than 1,000 votes in 2004, and his namesake, V.S. Sudheeran, had polled over 8,000.         
	This year, there are two Shashis in the fray against the Congress VIP candidate Shashi Tharoor from Thiruvananthapuram.                    WITH INPUTS FROM JAYANTH JACOB, SATISH NANDGAONKAR AND BASANT RAWAT

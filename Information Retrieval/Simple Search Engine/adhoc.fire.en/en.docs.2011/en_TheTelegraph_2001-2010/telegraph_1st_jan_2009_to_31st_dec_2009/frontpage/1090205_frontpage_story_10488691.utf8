The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | People express bandh feelings
                                                                                                           People express bandh feelings
          G.C. SHEKHAR AND SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	Feb. 4: The bandh that the Supreme Court refused to stay evoked poor response in Tamil Nadu today.        
	Many people ignored the strike call to protest Sri Lankas military offensive against Tamil Tigers, a day after the Chief Justice of India wondered aloud: What can this court do? Everybody has a right to express their feelings.        
	The three-judge bench was responding to a petition by a Chennai resident who wanted the general strike to be stayed by the apex court.        
	The court will hear the case on February 16 but the people gave their verdict today: buses, trains and planes were unaffected, while government offices, banks and most offices were open.        
	That the bandh was not called by the ruling party helped. Unlike in Calcutta, where it is childs play to enforce a bandh, such protests usually cripple the entire Tamil Nadu only if they have the blessings of the official machinery.        
	The bandh today was called by a newly formed coalition of pro-Tamil Tiger parties, which claimed the strike was successful. The group does not have much fan following, though the Sri Lanka issue has resulted in two instances of self-immolation so far.        
	Life is normal, buses are plying, attendance in government offices is near normal, chief secretary S.K. Sripathy said, adding that stray incidents of violence had been reported in the state.        
	I am glad that the people of Tamil Nadu gave a fitting riposte to the organisers of the bandh by showing it had no popular support. The state governments warning to use the national security act also helped, said J.S. Satishkumar, the Congress supporter who had petitioned the Supreme Court.        
	As colleges had been shut, only schools functioned. With board exams less than two months away, we did not want to miss the special classes and made it a point to go to school, said R. Sashanka, a Class XII student.         
	Shutdown still illegal        
	The Supreme Courts observation has sown some seeds of confusion, but lawyers clarified that the 1997 judgment of a three-judge bench upholding a ban on bandhs or complete shutdowns still stood undisturbed. Only a larger bench can overrule that order, the lawyers said.        
	The Chief Justice sitting on a three-judge bench cannot overrule another three-judge bench judgment. Such observations are made depending upon the facts of a case. Though obiter dicta  the non-binding part of an order  these observations carry weight, lawyer A. Raghunath said.         
	If the court intends to change the law, it can only be done after the issue has been referred to a larger bench of five judges, the lawyer added.

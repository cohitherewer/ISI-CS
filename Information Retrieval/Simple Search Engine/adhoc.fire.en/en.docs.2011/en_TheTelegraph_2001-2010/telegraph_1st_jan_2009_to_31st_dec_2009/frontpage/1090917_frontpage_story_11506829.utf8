The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Decades with Left and a day without it
                                                                                                           Decades with Left and a day without it
          AVIJIT SINHA                              
	Siliguri, Sept. 16: Siliguri woke up today to a feeling Mamata Banerjee would like an entire generation in Bengal to experience in 2011: decades of unending Left rule and then an empty pedestal awaiting a successor.        
	Ask Jiban Nath, who joined the Siliguri municipality as a junior clerk when he was 28. In the 24 years he has logged at the public works department, Nath has never worked under a non-Left dispensation.         
	Besides, Naths nearly quarter-century service is still four years shy of the Left record of 28 years at the helm in Siliguri. In the intervening years, many things have changed, including the character of the civic body that graduated from a municipality to a corporation in 1994.        
	Twenty-four years of familiarity are hard to kick. It is a strange feeling knowing that Asokda will no longer preside over the affairs of the corporation, Nath said. He may not have been the mayor, but his presence has always been dominant here.        
	All that Nath has known since he joined the civic body is that the boss of the municipality is Asokda, never mind the then chairman of the municipality, Asok Bhattacharya, is now the states urban development minister.        
	After nearly three decades of Left rule  much like the administration at Writers which is four years older than the Siliguri dispensation that has been dislodged  Nath said the seat of power and those who occupied it had become indistinguishable. It does not matter which political party runs the SMC (Siliguri Municipal Corporation), Nath said.        
	For 52-year-old Manik Pal, a bank employee of Champasari who for most of his entire adult life has seen the Left in power at the SMC, the change in guard is somewhat confusing.         
	Is a change after so many years good for us? Hasnt the SMC done some good work also? Pal asked today.         
	Ive never thought about this seriously as I assumed that the Left rule here would continue. Maybe it is conditioning.        
	Some said the Left might have been ingrained in their consciousness, but that did not mean its record could not be questioned.         
	The Left has become a part of our consciousness since they have been here for so long, said 48-year-old Subhankar Ghosh, an income-tax consultant.         
	It is also true that in the last 28 years of their rule, Siliguri has also grown rapidly. But has anyone examined this growth? Malls have come up and there is congestion perpetually in all the arterial roads. Is this development?        
	Let us give this new team a fair chance, said Partha Sarathi Das, the 55-year-old principal of Surya Sen College. Let them prove the sceptics wrong.

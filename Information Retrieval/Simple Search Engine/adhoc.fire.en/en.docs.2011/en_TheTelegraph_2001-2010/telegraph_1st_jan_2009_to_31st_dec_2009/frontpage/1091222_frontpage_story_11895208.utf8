	Darjeeling, Dec. 21: The demand for Gorkhaland made it to the tripartite talks table today for the first time, prompting the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha to claim some headway and government sources to suggest that a logical concession had been granted to let off steam.        
	The next stage of bargaining will revolve around upgrading the talks  held today in Darjeeling between bureaucrats and the Morcha  to the political level.         
	The Morcha has set a 45-day deadline for the political-level talks  a euphemism for discussions with Union home minister P. Chidambaram and chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.        
	The demand was raised soon after officials from both the Centre and the state told the Morcha delegation that there was no political consensus to form a separate state. State officials later stressed on this point to insist that no ground was yielded.        
	But the Morcha will keep up the pressure by reviving protest programmes a day after Christmas. ( )         
	There was a detailed discussion on every aspect on the formation of Gorkhaland and the issues related to it like lack of political consensus and the legalities involved, said Union home secretary G.K. Pillai, who chaired the meeting.        
	At the earlier rounds, the specific statehood demand had been raised by Morcha representatives alone while the government focused on development and special status.        
	On the demand for political-level talks, Pillai said the officials could only place this demand before the Union and state governments.        
	Morcha president Bimal Gurung, who was not part of the delegation, later said: The Centre took the talks lightly. We must neither be too happy nor too sad.         
	A Morcha leader interpreted Gurungs nor-too-sad reference as cautious optimism. Gurung is satisfied but is aware that the Gorkha people have a long way to go.         
	A few days ago, Bengal home secretary Ardhendu Sen had said Gorkhaland was not on the agenda and only development-related issues would be discussed. But today we were firm that only Gorkhaland would be discussed and that is precisely what has happened, a Morcha leader said. This is a victory for us.        
	But officials at Writers Buildings said the government knew that eventually the demand for Gorkhaland would have to be discussed and agreeing to do so was no major concession.        
	It is not possible to go on having round after round without discussing the Morchas principal and only demand, an official said. Posturing forms a very important part, which is why the home secretary had said Gorkhaland did not figure on the agenda. So, after this, even a minor concession may mean a lot to the Morcha.        
	The official added that discussing Gorkhaland did not mean that either the state or the central government had conceded anything.

  - Hottest November 12 in a decade, illness risk hovers           G.S. MUDUR AND MEGHDEEP BHATTACHARYA                                                          
	Nov. 12: Cyclone Phyan spared Mumbai when it was at its fiercest but its dying residue has made eastern India warmer and turned the region around Calcutta into a temperature hotspot that may precipitate respiratory illnesses.        
	The minimum temperature in Calcutta today was four degrees above normal at 22.6 degrees Celsius, making it the hottest November 12 the city has experienced this decade.        
	The cyclone has weakened into a low-pressure zone that hovered today over Madhya Pradesh, drawing relatively warm winds and moisture from the Bay of Bengal towards eastern India, according to meteorologists.         
	Such temperature fluctuations may alter the concentrations of potential allergens and microbes which, along with air pollution, may precipitate illness in susceptible people, allergy and infectious disease specialists have cautioned.        
	It isnt the temperature itself but its effects on allergens and infectious organisms which lead to symptoms, said Vannan Kandi Vijayan, the director of the Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute, New Delhi. The concentration of certain pollen grains and other types of allergens, including bacteria and viruses, in the atmosphere may increase during such transient spurts in temperature, he said.        
	The maximum temperature in Calcutta over the past two days has also been about 3 to 4 degrees Celsius above normal and the India Meteorological Department has predicted maximum temperatures to remain between 33 degrees Celsius and 32 degrees Celsius over the next three days.        
	Eastern India is experiencing an indirect effect of cyclone Phyan, said Gokul Debnath, director at the IMD, Calcutta. The moisture drawn over eastern India by the cyclones residue has contributed to cloud build-up over parts of Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand.        
	The clouds prevent heat from escaping into space, he said. The relatively warm winds from the Bay of Bengal are also preventing cooler winds from the northwest to blow across eastern India, further contributing to the warmth.        
	But meteorologists said the warmer weather should be viewed as a short-lived fluctuation around the normal temperature value. The temperature oscillates around the mean value, said Ajit Tyagi, director-general, IMD.        
	In situations when allergen and microbial load is high, air pollution can further raise the risk of illness with pollutants serving as ferrying vehicles for microbes.         
	Pollution may aid the spread of bacteria, viruses, or allergens, said Dev Kumar Kesar, head of medicine at the Asian Institute of Medical Sciences near New Delhi. That may explain why susceptible people are more comfortable after a little bit of rain, he said.

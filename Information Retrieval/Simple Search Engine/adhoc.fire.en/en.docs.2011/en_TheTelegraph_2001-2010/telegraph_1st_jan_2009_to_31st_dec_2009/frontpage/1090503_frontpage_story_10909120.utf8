	Nagaon, May 2: Assam Rifles today found itself in the dock over the death of senior Autonomous State Demand Committee leader and pastor Liden Jidung.        
	The ASDC today demanded a high-level inquiry into the alleged custodial death of Jidung yesterday, punishment to the culprits and adequate compensation to his family. It has called a 12-hour North Cachar Hills bandh on Monday to protest against the killing.         
	The NC Hills district administration today ordered a magisterial inquiry to be conducted by J.K. Bhuyan. He has been asked to submit his report within 15 days. Sources said the administration has also decided to convene a meeting with Jidungs family members to discuss the case.        
	A team of Assam Rifles had picked up Jidung along with Joraibasti village headman Johen Longmailai and ASDC Hadingma unit secretary Rajen Langthasa on Thursday on charges of having ties with the banned Dima Halam Daogah (Jewel).         
	Yesterday morning, the Assam Rifles handed over Jidungs body to Haflong police. The other two were also handed over in a critical condition. The paramilitary force attributed Jidungs death to his health condition.         
	Assam Rifles commanding officer B.B. Yadav said they were unaware that Jidung was diabetic and had high blood pressure.         
	Jidungs body was sent to Haflong civil hospital for post mortem. A four-member team of specialists, who carried out the post mortem, failed to identify the cause of death.         
	Parikhit Barman, a senior surgeon at Haflong civil hospital, said they had referred the case to Guwahati and handed back the body to the police.         
	Sources said Haflong police, accompanied by Jidungs wife, Ruphson, has taken the body to Guwahati for a special post mortem by forensic experts at the Gauhati Medical College Hospital.        
	The 45-year-old Dimasa leader has a daughter who is doing a software engineering course in Bangalore and a son who is a Class XII student in a Dimapur school.        
	The ASDC decided to launch a democratic struggle for justice against the atrocity by security forces on villagers at a special party conclave in Haflong today.        
	Jidung was asked by Langthasa and Longmailai to write a letter to higher authorities against the Assam Rifles. The latter picked up the three on charges of writing against their battalion, senior ASDC leader G. Daologupu said. The Assam Rifles said Jidung had links with the DHD (J).

	London, Oct. 2: Men with higher levels of the female sex hormone oestrogen are more macho, a study shows.        
	Tough guys have always been said to suffer from too much testosterone  but oestrogen is also to blame, say scientists.        
	Tests on male mice found female sex hormones boosts aggression and those with the most are likelier to pick fights and mark their territories with urine. The new findings published in Cell suggest hardmen like 007 star Daniel Craig and hell-raising actor Russell Crowe may have their feminine side to thank for their enduring appeal to women.        
	Dr Nirao Shah, an assistant professor of anatomy, said: This really changes the way we view male and female behaviours.        
	The study found it is early oestrogen exposure that masculinises boys to be boys  a phenomenon that owes more to girl power than was ever suspected. Dr Shah, of California University, said: Its been known for decades oestrogen may play a role in making males behave like males. What we do here is to provide insight into the logic of how oestrogen regulates that behaviour.        
	Oestrogens regulate the menstrual cycle in women and cause the changes in female body shape at puberty. Testosterone causes hair growth and the deepening of the voice in boys.        
	But men and women naturally both produce small quantities of both hormones which scientists now think are sides of the same coin in regulating many body functions.        
	They now know, for example, that it is oestrogen, not testosterone, which determines when the bones stop growing. Men who do not produce any oestrogen keep growing. Previous research has shown oestrogen is essential in male fertility after mice genetically engineered to have no cells that are sensitive to the hormone turned out sterile.

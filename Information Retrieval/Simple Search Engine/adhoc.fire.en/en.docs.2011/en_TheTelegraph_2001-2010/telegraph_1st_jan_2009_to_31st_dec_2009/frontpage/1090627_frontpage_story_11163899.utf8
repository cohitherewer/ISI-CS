          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Bhubaneswar, June 26: Union home minister P. Chidambaram today said that combating Naxalites was the primary duty of the state police and the government should commit more forces to fight Left-wing extremism.        
	The Centre will extend support on 1:1 ratio. For every company of the state police, I will commit one. I had told the Bengal government: You commit one, I will give one, Chidambaram said this afternoon at the end of his two-day visit to Orissa.        
	When his attention was drawn to Orissas demands for more central forces, the minister said: It must be remembered that Left-wing extremism is affecting many states. The Centre has to extend assistance to several states. But the state government must also improve its police strength and commit more forces to fight this, he emphasised.        
	Before leaving for Delhi, Chidambaram also held discussions with chief minister Naveen Patnaik and senior government officials about plans to combat the Left-wing extremism We will examine the suggestions and demands to extend support as much as we can, he said later.        
	On the state government having recruited 4,000 police personnel whose training was underway, Chidambaram said: Im sure when this new human resources are added, the state government will be in a better position to fight the Maoist menace.        
	Our response to the Naxalite violence is that there is no room for violence. The CPI (Maoist) has already been and is now named as a terrorist organisation and we cant yield any ground to them, he said. Asked whether he was happy with the progress in countering Maoist menace in Orissa, the Union minister said its a long battle and the state government was fighting against odds.         
	Whether to use the army to fight the Maoists, he said: This requires a police action, who are competent to handle it. Chidambaram said, adding choppers would be provided to Orissa whenever required.         
	Earlier during the day, he also visited three relief camps in the riot-hit Kandhamal district. What happened on August 23 last year and thereafter  38 people, mostly Christians, were killed in the subsequent communal riots  is deeply regrettable and condemnable, he said         
	Stating that 4,620 families had been affected by the riot, he said: I think its not a very large number and not difficult for the state government to rehabilitate.

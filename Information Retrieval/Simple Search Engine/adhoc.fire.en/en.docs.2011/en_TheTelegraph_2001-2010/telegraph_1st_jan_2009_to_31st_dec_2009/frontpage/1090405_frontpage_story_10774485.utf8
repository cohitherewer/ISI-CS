The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Soren vetoes Durga move
                                                                                                           Soren vetoes Durga move

	Ranchi/Dumka, April 4: JMM chief Shibu Sorens eldest son stunned his own party and allies by filing his nomination for the Godda Lok Sabha seat, meant for the Congress according to a pre-election deal, forcing his ailing father to fax a message from New Delhi clarifying to the local deputy commissioner that Durga wasnt a party nominee.        
	Durgas move came a day after Soren left him and younger sibling Hemant in charge of the JMMs campaign after he had to be flown back to Delhi for treatment.        
	It also opens up a new power centre within the party which was grappling with the possibility that Soren senior  a huge draw by himself in the state  may not be able to campaign in these elections because of his deteriorating health.         
	Todays development was a severe blow to the state leadership of both the JMM and the Congress who were trying their best to ensure the success of their seat-sharing agreement.        
	Should he choose to remain in the fray, Durga  he has claimed the party symbol  would be locking horns with the Congress candidate, sitting MP Furkan Ansari, and the BJPs Nishi Kant Dubey.         
	In his fax, a lengthy statement listing all the names of JMM candidates, Soren has asked the Election Commission to take action against Durga. As the president of JMM, I have signed form A and B in respect seven candidates contesting the Dumka, Rajmahal, Giridih, Jamshedpur, Hazaribagh, Palamau and Koderma Lok Sabha seats. Any candidate producing form A and B apart from those in the above mentioned (constituencies) may be treated as forged and hence action as available under the law may be initiated against them, Soren said.        
	Godda districts sub-electoral officer confirmed that the DC, Virendra Ram, had received Sorens fax. The Congress, too, latched onto the JMM chiefs assurance that Durga wasnt the partys official nominee.         
	The JMM though was left ducking for cover. The nomination (Durgas) can be withdrawn by April 8. We still have time to work out an amicable solution, said the partys central committee member, Supriyo Bhattacharya.        
	Voting in Godda is scheduled for April 23.        
	Durga filed his nomination around 2.40pm at the Godda DCs office accompanied by the partys local district chief, Premnandan Mandal, and a few supporters. But, senior JMM leaders like Hemlal Murmu  a Godda resident  and former MLA Prasant Mandal who are usually always with the Sorens were conspicuous by their absence.

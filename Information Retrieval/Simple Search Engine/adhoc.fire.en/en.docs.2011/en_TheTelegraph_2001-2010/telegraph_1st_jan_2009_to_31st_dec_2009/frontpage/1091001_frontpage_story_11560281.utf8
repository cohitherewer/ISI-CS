The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Apex court shield for Subba
                                                                                                           Apex court shield for Subba
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                                     
	New Delhi, Sept. 30: The Supreme Court today refused to direct the CBI to take action against former Tezpur MP Moni Kumar Limba (Subba) even though the investigating agency has cast doubts about documents produced by the lottery king and politician in support of his nationality.        
	We will not give any directions to the CBI to take action, a bench, headed by Chief Justice of India, K.G. Balakrishnan, said, refusing a prayer by Noida resident Birendra Nath Singh.         
	It was on Singhs plea that the court had asked the CBI in 2005 to verify documents submitted by Subba.         
	Some of these documents were submitted to the Election Commission in the run-up to elections and others to Parliament.         
	Singh had alleged that Subba was actually a Nepali citizen, Mani Raj Limboo, who fled that country after committing a heinous crime and illegally settled down in India.         
	Subba, however, claimed that he was born in Bengal and later migrated to Assam.         
	Appearing for Singh, lawyer Ambhoj Kumar Sinha today argued that since the CBI report had gone against Subba, the court should direct the CBI to take further action against the MP, who lost the 2009 parliamentary elections from Tezpur.         
	An FIR should be filed and action taken against him, Sinha argued.         
	He has committed all types of offences. This is a serious case. The court should take action against him, Sinha said. But the court refused to countenance his prayer.         
	Subbas lawyer Abhishek Manu Singhvi, however, opposed any such move.         
	He has a right to challenge the reports of the CBI, Singhvi argued.         
	The CBI has so far submitted three reports against Subba  the latest was placed before the court today.         
	The CBIs last report of December 10, 2007 had recommended that action should be taken against Subba under Sections 193 (fabricating false evidence), 420 (cheating), 468 (forgery), 471 (using forged documents as genuine) and 12 of the Indian Passports Act.         
	Lawyers later said the court has full powers to direct the CBI to take action against Subba. Otherwise, what was the purpose of the inquiry against him? one of them said.         
	You cannot direct an inquiry and then refuse to take further action if any illegality is thrown up during the course of the inquiry, lawyers said.         
	The CBI anyway does not require court permission to take action, another lawyer said.         
	The CBI had sparked a furore when it had claimed in the apex court on April 28, 2008 that Subbas birth certificate and other documents, submitted to the Election Commission to prove his Indian nationality, appeared to be fake.         
	Subba was one of the richest candidates to contest the 2009 elections  his income as disclosed to the Election Commission was around Rs 60 crore.         
	 This is not the first time that Subbas nationality has been questioned.         
	The CBI had probed his antecedents in 1997 after then Assam chief minister, Prafulla Mahanta, raised doubts about his citizenship. But the matter died down.

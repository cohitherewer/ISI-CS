          ANANYA SENGUPTA                            Rocky ( in yellow shirt) and his accomplices after their arrest. (Prem Singh)                                  
	New Delhi, July 30: A gym instructor Ribhu Chawla idolised and fondly called bhai was arrested today for allegedly kidnapping and killing the 16-year-old student though the teenagers family had paid part of the ransom.        
	Rocky, 27, nominated Mr Delhi in 1997 and 1998, had no intention of returning Ribhu, police said after interrogating him and three other arrested accomplices.        
	Deputy commissioner (south) Ajay Kashyap said Rocky, who had run up gambling debts of about Rs 30 lakh, befriended Ribhu only with the intention of abducting him for ransom.         
	Kashyap denied claims by the Chawlas, hours after Ribhus body was found yesterday, that the abductors had killed the boy because they got wind of a police trap.         
	The officer, however, refused to say if the family had informed the police about the ransom. They gave us only some of the information. Thats all I can say. I dont want to comment on something that will show the family as well as the investigating agency in poor light.        
	The comments raised questions about the extent to which the family co-operated with the police and whether the cops had bungled by setting a trap, as the Chawlas had claimed.        
	They (the abductors) had specific information from an insider close to the family. We are zeroing in on him. It could be a friend or a relative who introduced Ribhu to Rocky. Rocky had no intention of letting the boy go, they had planned to kill him, Kashyap said.        
	The police said today they had recovered Rs 8 lakh of the Rs 15 lakh the Chawlas had paid the abductors. Rocky got Rs 6.5 lakh and Rishab (one of the accomplices held) Rs 4 lakh. The other two shared the remaining Rs 4.5 lakh, an officer said.        
	Kashyap said in cases where the victims know the kidnappers, chances of their survival were highly improbable as the abductors are wary of being identified.        
	An officer involved in investigating another case, that of the murder of 12-year-old Mannan Mahajan by an acquaintance, said: Neither Ribhu nor Mannan did anything wrong. They went with people they knew and felt safe being with. These cases become almost impossible to prevent and death becomes inevitable if the kidnappers arent caught in time.        
	Mannans body was found in a drain three months ago. The police had arrested a chartered accountant for the abduction.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Border forces pulled back

	Chakulia, June 26: Police and paramilitary forces patrolling the Jharkhand-Bengal border along Dhalbhumgarh and Ghatshila were pulled back last evening, sparking fresh fear among residents of Chakulia, a tiny commercial hub close to the border.        
	Units of paramilitary forces, including CRPF and BSF, that were deployed on June 19 for sealing the Jharkhand-Bengal border  7km from here  in the wake of the anti-Maoist operations in Lalgarh, had now taken positions in separate camps set up in Chakulia, Matiaband and Dhalbhumgarh.        
	The East Singhbhum SP, Naveen Kumar Singh, said the forces, till now deployed on the porous border, were still stationed in Chakulia, but were being used for long-range patrolling in the interiors and to conduct random checks in and around the border areas.         
	Apart from CRPF and BSF companies lodged in separate camps and also in Chakulia police station, we have also stationed floating forces at three places. The floating force, comprising jawans with anti-terrorist commando training, are carrying out surprise checks in railway stations and at strategic locations in Chakulia and Ghatshila blocks.        
	The deputy inspector general of police, (Kolhan), M.K Mishra, also confirmed re-deployment, but did not elaborate why such a decision was taken, especially when security forces in Bengal achieved their first significant breakthrough when they reclaimed control of Kadashole to the north of Lalgarh after their first engagement with the rebels. Now, the situation is normal along the border, and there will be reinforcements if the situation so arises.        
	Residents of Chakulia, monitoring day-to-day developments closely, realised this was along-drawn battle. We are not worried because of the ongoing operations in Bengal. We fear what will happen to us in the near future, said Ananta Pal, a resident of Murathakura village. Pal, who runs a wholesale business at the local market, said several businessmen like him were suffering as their trade had almost choked.        
	No wonder movement of vehicles between Chakulia and Jhargram, 35km away, had been reduced to a trickle ever since the Lalgarh operations were launched on June 19. Its like living amid a time-bomb that can go off anytime in Lalgarh. And when that happens, people like us in Chakulia will have to bear the consequences, said Ashim Chakraborty, who plies his truck to Jhargram for a living.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | I-Day India a fatal attraction: Advisories
                                                                                                           I-Day India a fatal attraction: Advisories
  - Is it unsafe?          CITHARA PAUL                            The Taj Mahal, a must-see for visitors to India                                        
	New Delhi, Aug. 13: Incredible India seems incredibly unsafe this Independence Day.        
	At least that is the suggestion in a spate of travel advisories issued by some foreign governments that have warned their citizens against travelling to India around the August 15 weekend.        
	The US, Australia and Canada, which hold the first, third and sixth positions in terms of tourist numbers, have come out with such warnings within the past week.        
	All three countries have asked their citizens to exercise a high degree of caution in travelling to India and warned them of possible terror attacks ahead of August 15.         
	If they cant avoid the travel, they have been asked to avoid crowded places, tourist hotspots and prominent government buildings.         
	The alert issued by the US embassy highlights the likelihood of an attack. There is a continuing threat from terrorism throughout India and the upcoming series of major holidays (including August 15) could provide terrorist groups an opportunity or pretext to stage an attack, it says.        
	The advisory from Australia, put out barely two days after foreign minister S.M. Krishna left its shores, asked citizens to exercise a high degree of caution because of the high risk of terrorist activity.         
	We continue to receive reports of possible threats against prominent business and tourist locations, including Mumbai and New Delhi. Terrorists may be planning attacks against Indian political and security interests, it says.        
	The Canadian alert warned of terror attacks, blasts and violence at any place and at any time. It referred to last years serial blasts in various cities and said: Attacks can take place anywhere and at any time in India and many recent incidents have resulted in deaths and/or injuries.         
	The Canadian advisory made a special mention of Mumbai. It said while the city is beginning to return to a semblance of normality after last Novembers attack, the terror threat was always high, including places frequented by foreign visitors and expatriates.         
	Some of the over 170 people killed in the 26/11 strike were Canadians.        
	The tourism ministry has tried to downplay the alerts, saying the Incredible India brand  which is the ministrys logo and a buzzword for the governments tourism drive  is very popular. These kind of advisories wont harm us, said a ministry official.         
	The industry disagreed. These advisories are bound to send wrong messages about the security scenario in the country, coming as it does immediately after English teams pullout from the ongoing World Badminton Championship, said S. Nagaraj of travel agency India Tourism. He spoke of cancellations of hotel bookings and airline tickets, immediately after the alerts were issued.        
	Others said the government itself was responsible for the negative alerts. Sanjeev Reddy of India Travel, another travel agency, said: Our government itself goes to town about the security alerts in connection with Independence Day. They have made it a custom to arrest some persons allegedly plotting a blast around Independence Day every year. These signals are collected by foreign embassies and communicated to their countries which issue advisories without thinking of implications.

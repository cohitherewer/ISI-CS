          AMIT GUPTA                               
	Ranchi, July 30: Governor K. Sankaranarayanan today unveiled a 100-day agenda for the states laggard bureaucracy to kickstart a slew of measures for the development of the state under Presidents rule since January 19.        
	One of his main priorities, chalked out after a series of meetings with all departmental secretaries and deputy commissioners of districts over the last two days, was to set right the implementation of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) so that its benefits reached the deserving in Jharkhand, now waiting for elections sometime during the end of the year.        
	This apart, the governor called for a revamp of public distribution system (PDS), extending drought relief schemes to all 11 dry districts and tackling drinking water issues by repairing defunct tubewells and sinking new ones.        
	Besides, Sankaranarayanan wanted pending land rights applications made under the Scheduled Tribe and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act to be disposed, about 3,800 more anganwadis to be made operational, the backlog in social security pension payments to widows and the aged be cleared and power connectivity provided to 1 lakh below poverty line families under the Rajiv Gandhi Gramin Vidyutikaran Yojana (RGGVY).         
	There will be monitoring by five senior secretaries in each commissionary at three stages. I want to achieve the target at any cost. Bureaucracy has to behave in a transparent manner. Otherwise, I will ensure they do, asserted the governor at Project Building, the states main secretariat.         
	The secretaries who had been made responsible for monitoring the schemes included R.S. Poddar, the principal secretary of revenue; D.K. Tiwary, the excise secretary; Sukhdeo Singh, the secretary, forest and environment; Arun Kumar Singh, the secretary of tourism; and Shailesh Kumar Singh, the secretary of urban development.        
	On PDS revamp, the governor set a deadline of August 5 for DCs to ensure direct delivery of foodgrain from central agencies to fair price shops. Moreover, he said distribution of sugar should be resumed by August 17.         
	In other policy changes, the governor resolved that new licences for fair price shops would be given to women self-help groups. Also, village-level grain banks should be set up by the end of August.         
	The governor also decided to allocate Rs 9.20 crore for free distribution of ration to BPL and Antyodaya families in 11 drought-affected districts from August 1. These districts include Garhwa, Palamau, Latehar, Chatra, Giridih, Godda, Sahebganj, Jamtara, Dumka, Deoghar and Pakur.         
	Supplementary nutrition would be provided in drought affected districts at the rate of Rs 2 per head as per norms of Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) and immediate sustenance allowance of Rs 20 per adult and Rs 15 per child was to be issued.        
	For this, Rs 50 lakh would be allocated to each drought-hit district.         
	On NREGS, DCs had been told to ensure that each village had at least one scheme under implementation and there should not be a paucity of jobs when villagers sought employment. Also, all pending NREGS schemes would have to be completed by the end of October, by which time labourers must be provided at least 60 days of work. Sankaranarayanan said development was the only answer for emerging menaces like left wing extremism, which should be dealt with in a mild but effective way by providing employment and extending other facilities in rural hinterlands.

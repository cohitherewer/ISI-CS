          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                      
	New Delhi, March 26: Deserted by three allies  the RJD, the LJP and now the PMK  the Congress has trained its sights on the post-election scene, aiming to win at least 150 seats on its own which it hopes will bring back the old partners and attract new ones.        
	The confidence palpable on Tuesday, when the party released its manifesto and unveiled Manmohan Singh as the candidate for Prime Minister, took a knock as it dawned on the Congress that it was out of the reckoning in almost 120 seats  80 in Uttar Pradesh and 40 in Bihar  with the Samajwadi Party alliance not taking off and that with the RJD broken.        
	The party will also have to fight hard to cut its losses in Andhra Pradesh, where it is up against a combined Opposition in Telengana and an unknown entity, the Praja Rajyam Party, in the coastal belt and Rayalaseema, and Maharashtra where it is almost at the NCPs mercy, sources said.         
	It is looking to make gains in Rajasthan, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Kerala and Bengal, which together have 140 seats.        
	Despite the uncertainties, sources said Sonia Gandhi had rejected the view of some influential colleagues, mostly from the Rajya Sabha, that if the Congress fell short of its 2004 tally  145  it should sit in the Opposition and rebuild the party in the hope it would get a majority or close to one in the next elections.         
	There is no semi-final in politics, every election is a final and should be treated thus, a source said.         
	After the PMK announced it was crossing over to the ADMKs side, the Congress panicked. Till yesterday, it had been trying to persuade health minister Anbumani Ramadoss to stick with the UPA. But Anbumani said his father and PMK founder, S. Ramadoss, had made up his mind and he could do nothing.        
	Anbumani promised to return to the UPA if it was re-elected, sources said. He said the PMK was forced to switch sides because of the raw deal from the DMK and that the partys objective was to maximise returns to be able to strengthen a secular coalition. But PMK sources refused to confirm this and wondered if their leaders thought that far ahead.        
	The Congress is trying hard to woo the only unattached party of consequence in Tamil Nadu, the DMDK headed by film star Vijayakanth. In Maharashtra, chief minister Ashok Chavan and his predecessor Vilasrao Deshmukh complained of being shortchanged by the NCP and revived the demand for going solo. But the central leadership has told them to go back and work to the best of their abilities with Sharad Pawar.        
	Congress minister Kapil Sibal put the churning in the UPA down to the conflicting aspirations of regional and national parties jostling for space. In the overall national scenario, the secular parties are still together. There are little streams that flow from the big river but the streams will eventually re-merge with the big river, Sibal said.

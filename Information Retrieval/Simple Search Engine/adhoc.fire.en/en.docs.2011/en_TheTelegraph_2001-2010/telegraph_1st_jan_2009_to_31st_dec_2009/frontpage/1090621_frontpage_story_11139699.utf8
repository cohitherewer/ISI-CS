          SHEENA K.                              
	Raipur, June 20: Five CRPF personnel were killed, while 15 others injured when Maoists detonated a landmine blast to blow up a mini-truck in Dantewada district this evening.        
	The attack was meticulously planned, as the rebels set a few trucks of a private contractor on fire in Tongpal village, about 100km from Dantewada, this morning.         
	The CRPF jawans, along with police personnel, left for Tongpal. After patrolling the area, the jawans were returning to Dantewada when they were trapped into the Naxalite ambush near Kokanara village around 6pm.        
	The rebels allowed jeeps to pass and targeted the mini-truck, carrying 20 jawans, which was last on the row to inflict maximum casualty.        
	The condition of the five injured jawans was critical.

                                                                                                           Red dens get ready for polls
  - Campaigning ends for first phase, officials booth-bound          AMIT GUPTA                                                    
	Ranchi, April 14: Campaigning for six Lok Sabha seats in the states Naxalite belt ended today and polling personnel set out for booths in Maoist bastions for ensuring peaceful election on Thursday.        
	From this evening, the 85 candidates in fray in Chatra, Palamau, Koderma, Khunti, Hazaribagh and Lohardaga constituencies would have to go for door-to-door campaigning, as the model code of conduct restricts them from organising public rallies.        
	The political heavyweights locked in the first phase of the electoral battle include Yashwant Sinha, Babulal Marandi, Rameshwar Oraon, Bhuvneshwar Mehta, Inder Singh Namdhari and Karia Munda.        
	The polling personnel, who left the city for different Naxalite-hit destinations on duty, have only one question: Can we return home safe?        
	Is everything okay there? I am leaving Ranchi in an hour or so, a polling personnel deputed in a government school in Murpa, one of the booths for Khunti Lok Sabha seat, was heard saying to a resident of Tamar.        
	Murpa, a tiny village off the NH-33, falls under the Tamar police station area where armed Maoists hijacked a bank vehicle carrying over Rs 5 crore and gold last summer.        
	However, the government has a lot to offer for the personnel on poll duty. Though it has decided not to offer insurance cover to each personnel this time, a compensation of Rs 10 lakh would be given as ex gratia to an on-duty polling official who loses life because of Naxalite violence.        
	The government also ensured all its staff were pressed into poll service. A. Jha, a clerk of Ranchi College who is due to retire next year, would act as a polling officer in Tamar.         
	I have seen tough times in my life and am least bothered what would happen in the next couple of days, he said, trying to hide his anxiety.        
	The call for poll duty is so urgent that Shailendra Kumar, an executive engineer of the drinking water and sanitation department posted in Gumla who can barely walk, arrived at the distribution centre, Birsa Munda Stadium in Morabadi, assisted by two colleagues.         
	I cant walk on my own. But I am here to report for duty and now it is up to the district officials whether to relieve me from the same, said Kumar, who took the arduous journey of about 100km in his private vehicle despite todays Naxalite bandh.        
	Meanwhile, Rahul Gandhi will address a rally at Deoghar tomorrow in support of Congresss Godda nominee Furkan Ansari. Furkan is locked in a fight with Durga Soren, Pradeep Yadav, Nishikant Dubey and Iqbal Durrani.

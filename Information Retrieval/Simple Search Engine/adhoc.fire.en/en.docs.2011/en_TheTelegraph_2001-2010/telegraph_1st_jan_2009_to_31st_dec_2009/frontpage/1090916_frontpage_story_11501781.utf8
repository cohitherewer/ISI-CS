          GORDON RAYNER                            Clare Irby                                  
	London, Sept. 15: A drunken socialite stripped to her knickers during a flight from Bangalore to London and cavorted with a male passenger in full view of fellow travellers, a jury has been told.        
	Clare Irby, a descendant of the Guinness brewing family, kissed Daniel Melia and allowed him to fondle her breasts even though his girlfriend was with him on the flight, it was claimed.        
	Her toddler son ran around the Kingfisher Airlines plane without a nappy on and at one stage Irby tossed a soiled nappy onto a row of seats behind her, it is alleged.        
	The 30-year-old defendant also became abusive towards airline staff when the captain ordered them not to give her any more alcohol, the London court heard.        
	Irby denied being drunk on the plane.        
	Bill McGivern, prosecuting, told the court that Irby began drinking red wine shortly after boarding the 11-hour flight from Bangalore in March.        
	Shivaneji Sharma, a flight attendant, told the jury Irby had drunk three to four glasses of wine in the first 90 minutes of the flight and added: She had absolutely no clue about the child and the way she was behaving was not tipsy, but drunk.        
	He said that at one point, Irby took off her skirt, revealing her black G-string, before changing into a pair of leggings in her seat in row 26 near the back of the aircraft.        
	McGivern said the defendant became friendly with Melia, 36, who was sitting behind her. Melias girlfriend was also on the flight.        
	Flight attendant Arpita Mehra said: The man was leaning forward and grabbing hold of her breast and they were kissing each other.        
	Asked how Irby reacted, she replied: She was enjoying it.        
	Neil Saunders, defending, suggested to the air stewardess that Melia  who is not before the court  had in fact touched Irbys upper arm, but she insisted it was her breast.        
	Saloni Khanna, director of the crew on flight number IT001, said that at one point she saw Irby sprawled across four seats and added: Her skirt had risen up to the waist and her underpants were visible. The child had dirtied his diapers and she wasnt aware.        
	After four hours, the captain ordered his staff to refuse to serve any more alcohol to Irby. She was arrested when the flight landed.         
	In a police interview, Irby said she was a single mother and was very tired on the flight. She said she had no more than four or five glasses of wine but it had affected her more than normal.        
	McGivern added: She did not accept there was anything inappropriate with a male on the flight and didnt accept she had thrown a dirty nappy.

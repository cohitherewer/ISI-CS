The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | US thrusts, Antony sidesteps
                                                                                                           US thrusts, Antony sidesteps
  - Hillary to mount pressure on defence verification pact           K.P. NAYAR                            Hillary and Antony: Playing hard to get                                         
	Washington, July 15: US secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton hopes to use her charm, guile and persuasion in New Delhi on Monday to ram down the throat of a deeply divided UPA government an end-use verification agreement for defence supplies from America.        
	Defence minister A.K. Antony is opposed to the agreement. So are sizeable sections of Indias men in uniform in the top tiers of all the three defence services who feel the agreement will compromise the independence and flexibility of the countrys armed forces.        
	At the time of writing, therefore, Antony has discreetly decided to stay away from the capital and not meet Clinton or sign the agreement. But this may yet change, according to Indian sources.        
	Robert Blake, the new assistant secretary of state for South Asia, who is travelling with Clinton to India, told reporters here today he was hopeful that the agreement would be signed on Monday between Clinton and the new external affairs minister, S.M. Krishna.        
	I am not saying it will definitely happen, Blake told this reporter in answer to a question. But it is on the table, he asserted.        
	Last month, Antony resisted severe pressure from General James Jones to clear the agreement when the US national security adviser called on the defence minister in New Delhi.         
	The pact will allow US officials to inspect any defence equipment that New Delhi buys from Washington, long after it has been bought, to satisfy the Pentagon that it is being used for the purpose for which it was presumably acquired by the Indian army, navy or air force.        
	Antony did not reject outright the idea that India could one day sign the agreement, which has been under negotiation for several years, but typically told Jones that political compulsions mandated that talks on the pact should continue.        
	But the Americans, in a hurry to sell military equipment to India, working through their lobbies in New Delhi and Mumbai, have now decided to cut the defence ministry out of the process and get the prime ministers office to use the ministry of external affairs to short-cut the Indian signature on the agreement.        
	Two other defence agreements under negotiation between India and the US are equally controversial: a logistics support agreement, which permits US ships and aircraft to refuel in India and vice versa and a communications interoperability and security memorandum of agreement, which commits India to absolute confidentiality about military equipment and processes bought from America.        
	Blake said these two pacts were still under negotiation and that only the end-use verification agreement was on the table for the Clinton visit.        
	As a sop for signing the end-use verification agreement on Monday, Clinton will tell the Indian side that Washington is ready to begin talks with New Delhi on reprocessing American spent nuclear fuel in India. Blake said the talks were most likely to begin at the end of this month.        
	India had notified the US on February 3 that it would like these talks, a part of the Indo-US nuclear deal, to begin soon.        
	The Obama administration, which has six months to respond to the Indian initiative, has been dragging its feet on the issue since then, but is now clearly offering it as a quid pro quo for the military agreement that it wants signed during the Clinton trip.

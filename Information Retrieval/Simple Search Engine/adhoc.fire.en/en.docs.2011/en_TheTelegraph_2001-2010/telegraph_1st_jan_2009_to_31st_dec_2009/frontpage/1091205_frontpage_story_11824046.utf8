          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jamshedpur, Dec. 4: Orissa and Jharkhand today decided to set up additional check-posts along the porous state border that is to be monitored with additional security forces in an effort to stop Maoists from crossing over during the final two legs of the five-phased Assembly elections in East and West Singhbhum and Seraikela-Kharsawan.        
	Deployment of forces will be made at vantage points to check infiltration of rebels from either side of the border, said Abhishek Kumar, the superintendent of police, Seraikela-Kharswan, after attending a two-hour review meeting between senior police officers of the two sates.        
	Presided over by DIG (Kolhan) M.K. Mishra, the meeting was held at the office of the superintendent of police (East Singhbhum) and attended by senior police officers of Mayurbhanj, Sundergarh, Keonjhar, Rourkela and the Singhbhum-Kolhan region.        
	The meeting was convened to workout a joint strategy with Orissa police to ensure free and fair elections in the border areas during the fourth and fifth phase of elections, Mishra told The Telegraph, adding that a similar meeting was held with Bengal police last month.        
	Apart from additional check-posts, a decision was taken to seal certain areas of the border during the polls.         
	We have identified a few strategic points in the Jharkhand-Orissa border, which would be sealed for the elections, said a senior CRPF official who attended the meeting.        
	Additional paramilitary personnel would be deployed in police stations of rebel-hit areas in both states. Moreover, proper security cover would be provided in other disturbed areas too, confirmed Kumar.        
	Both Orissa and Jharkhand agreed to exchange a list of Maoists and criminals operating in border areas where paramilitary forces, including the CRPF, would be deployed.        
	East Singhbhum superintendent of police Naveen Kumar Singh said they also agreed to constitute a core team that would share intelligence concerning Maoists.         
	The fourth phase of Assembly polls will see voting in seven constituencies of the area including Baharagora, Ghatshila, Potka, Majhgaon, Manoharpur, Chakradharpur and Ichagarh on December 12.         
	The fifth and the final phase of voting would be held for the Chaibasa, Jagannathpur, Kharsawan and Seraikela seats on December 18.

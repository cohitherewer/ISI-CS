  - MPs force Delhi to halt traffic to let citizens cross road           NISHIT DHOLABHAI                                                      The wait in calcutta    
	New Delhi, Feb. 18: Parliament has stepped in to resolve an everyday challenge confronting people in all walks of life other than a privileged few: how to cross the road.        
	Traffic in Delhi will stop at all junctions for 20 seconds every once in a while so that hapless pedestrians can walk across the road instead of waiting for the magnanimity of the traffic constable in the signal cage on the sidewalk or darting through a metallic slipstream risking life and limb.        
	The bad news is that the order covers only the national capital. But if Bengal does tomorrow what Delhi has been told to do today, life will become easier and safer for countless mothers clutching a child in one hand and a schoolbag in the other and waiting for what now seems like endless minutes in the sun after school hours.        
	Traffic signals now do have a greenlight window that allows pedestrians to cross the road. But when the signal will change and how long it will stay so depend entirely on the whim of the constable on duty who is supposed to analyse the intensity of the traffic flow and decide.        
	At busy crossings in Calcutta, police said a window ranging from 50 seconds to 2 minutes was expected to be spared for pedestrians but an officer admitted that the time range is not always adhered to. Pedestrians who have run for dear life when the signal has changed abruptly will vouch for that.        
	Till now, rarely has the pedestrian issue been raised in Parliament, presumably because MPs are usually not seen waiting at junctions for crossing the road.        
	The problem eventually walked into the hallowed halls of the Rajya Sabha when the RJDs Rajniti Prasad pointed to a class character: those with vehicles and those without them, although even car-owners have to cross the road on foot sometimes.        
	A persistent Prasad pointed to the travails of pedestrians and cyclists at Gol Dakhana, the five-road junction where the General Post Office is located and less than 2km from Parliament House. The busy crossing does not have any traffic signal which means pedestrians have little option but to wait, pray and scoot on the assumption that traffic has thinned and the probability of reaching the other side in one shape is high.        
	If you dont have a vehicle you cannot go to a hospital, Prasad said, raising his voice for millions of foot soldiers on Indias unsafe roads. As an old socialist, he was one of those without a vehicle, Prasad added.        
	The pitch brought forth some twitters initially but soon, others added their voice to Prasads cause.        
	Home minister P. Chidambaram  Delhi law enforcement comes under his ministry  treated the issue with the gravity it deserved.                    Cross hazard    
	In a two-page answer, Chidambaram directed the Delhi police commissioner to stop traffic at all junctions for 20 seconds. The 20-second window will be in place during non-peak hours also and more police personnel will be deployed to enforce it.        
	The step will especially help women and children, the minister noted.        
	The home minister said it was sad that the pedestrian has been pushed into subterranean subways by the explosion of the vehicle population in the capital.        
	He welcomed a suggestion that traffic, at least at Gol Dakhana  a heritage building  could be moved to a subway and pedestrians could use the road. Whether it will be feasible will be decided by experts.        
	The BJPs S.S. Ahluwalia asked if skywalks could be constructed. Why not cycle-zones and pedestrian zones in the city? the MP, known for boisterousness, asked in what could count among the most constructive suggestions from him yet in the House.        
	Chidambaram said that although new roads had facilities for cyclists, roads in the capital were constructed without envisioning such zones. Put on your thinking caps and find a solution, he appealed to the members.        
	The MPs did not forget to thump benches in appreciation of Prasads suggestion.

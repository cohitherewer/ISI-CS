          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 3: Teach, but dont talk in class  on your mobile that is.        
	Indias largest school board has asked teachers and even principals to restrict the use of cellphones in classrooms, laboratories and other public spaces on school premises to set an example to students.        
	This is because mobile phones can be a serious cause of distraction, lack of concentration, anxiety, fear and sometimes even misuse, the CBSE said in an advisory on July 29.        
	Students are already banned from bringing mobiles to school, but this is the first time the CBSE has included teachers and even principals in an advisory on restricting the use of cellphones on campus.        
	In Bengal, too, there is a blanket ban on students carrying cellphones to school. Although there is no such ban on teachers, they are not expected to carry mobile phones to classrooms or be seen talking on their phones in corridors.        
	CBSE officials confirmed that the advisory was not binding and schools that ignored it would not be penalised. But they added that the CBSE feels strongly about problems that could arise from the growing use of mobile phones by students and school staff.        
	The idea behind the advisory is not to ram down a rule but to stimulate debate and discussion. Each school can then take whatever action it feels is necessary, an official said.        
	The advisory said that even in the silent mode, mobile phones could be used by students to send text messages. The cameras on the phones can also be misused, it said.        
	The CBSEs moves to restrict the use of cellphones in schools followed a slew of cases involving students. The first instance of misuse that hit the headlines a few years ago involved a student of a Delhi school who filmed a sexual act and sent the MMS clip to friends.        
	Some parents have, however, argued that cellphones can help their child contact them in emergencies. Others say a personal phone adds to a girls security.

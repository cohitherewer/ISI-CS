The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Hung House, PM puzzle
                                                                                                           Hung House, PM puzzle
          RASHEED KIDWAI IN NEW DELHI                                              
	Most surveys predict a hung 15th Lok Sabha, with the UPA holding the edge but nowhere close to the majority mark of 272. Such a situation might open the door for L.K. Advani and the third fronts would-be Prime Ministers to fulfil their dream if the Congress insists on Manmohan Singhs continuation in the top post.        
	Several media houses have conducted independent poll surveys in the past few days in collaboration with leading pollsters and agencies.        
	According to the Week/C, the Congress will be the largest single party with 144 MPs in a House of 543, but the BJP will be breathing down its neck with 140. This survey, however, restricts the NDA tally to 186 while putting the UPAs at 234 (including the Samajwadi Partys estimated 32 MPs).        
	If this prediction comes true, the Congress would still have to look for support from the Left (predicted tally 33), or Mayavati (29) or Jayalalithaa and her allies (24) and a few other parties.        
	The arithmetic, however, is trickier than it looks because the moment the BSP enters the UPA, the Samajwadis bid goodbye. And if Jayalalithaa steps in, out goes M. Karunanidhis DMK, whom the Week/C survey gives 13 seats.        
	STAR News-AC Nielsens latest poll, conducted between March 26 and April 3, gives the UPA 203 seats and the NDA 191. This survey counts the Samajwadi-RJD-Lok Janshakti Party combine as a separate bloc (39 seats) and gives the third front 104 seats.        
	Going by this prediction, President Pratibha Patil may get a chance to invite Manmohan first but the UPA will then have to win over a whole lot of other parties. An earlier STAR News survey had predicted 257 seats for the UPA, including the Samajwadi-RJD-LJP seats.        
	The BJPs internal survey gives itself 160 and the Congress 135. It puts the NDA tally at 217 and the UPAs at 180.        
	India TV gives the NDA a marginal lead over the UPA, 187 to 178. Once again, the 82 third front MPs and the 65 from the fourth front  the Mulayam Singh Yadav-Lalu Prasad-Ram Vilas Paswan combine and other small parties  are likely to hold the key.        
	Congress and BJP leaders scoff at the idea of losing ground but privately both sides concede that the five-phase election will have a crucial sixth round, beginning soon after the results are announced on May 16.        
	The survey results throw up three possibilities. If their predictions come true, the Congress must act swiftly and decisively. Apart from negotiating with the likes of the Samajwadis, the daunting task will be winning over a Jayalalithaa in Tamil Nadu or a Nitish Kumar in Bihar.        
	Theoretically, the Left should be the easiest to persuade. Congress leaders, though, suspect that in exchange for possible support, the Left may insist on a government with a fresh face that reflects the communists concerns on key economic and foreign policy issues.        
	Such a demand, if made, is unlikely to go down well with the Congress, which on Tuesday said the issue of Manmohan as Prime Minister was non-negotiable as the party does not believe in negotiating leadership.        
	Sources claim Rahul Gandhi has suggested that the Congress sit in the Opposition if the situation gets too messy. That lofty option has very few takers in the party.        
	In the second scenario, the NDA forms the government backed by the bulk of the third front parties minus the Left. However, this is unlikely to happen without support from a known adversary, such as Mayavati or Mulayam.        
	In some circumstances, the NDA may hope to see a neutral Left abstain from the initial vote of confidence and let the government survive.        
	The third possibility is a third front Prime Minister backed by the BJP and other non-Congress parties. Both the Congress and the Left will then have to sit on the Opposition benches along with either the Samajwadis or Mayavati.        
	In terms of numbers, this scenario looks plausible but choosing a Prime Minister from among Nitish, Sharad Pawar, Jayalalithaa and the assorted other hopefuls could be a mind-boggling task.

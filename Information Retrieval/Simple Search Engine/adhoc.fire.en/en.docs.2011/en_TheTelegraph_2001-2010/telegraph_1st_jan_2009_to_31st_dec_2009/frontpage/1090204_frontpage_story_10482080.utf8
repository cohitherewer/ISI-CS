  - Home minister ticked off Basu, Ram on transfers, casualties          AMIT GUPTA                            Home minister P. Chidambaram at last weeks meeting in Ranchi. Telegraph picture                                        
	Ranchi, Feb. 3: Chief secretary A.K. Basu and director- general of police V.D. Ram should have known that half measures or half-truths do not work with P. Chidambaram.         
	For, at his meeting with the state top brass last week, the Union home minister is understood to have ticked off Basu for not putting his foot down against the premature transfers of deputy commissioners by the former Shibu Soren government. And DGP Ram was left ducking for cover when his figures on the number of casualties in Maoist violence fell short by 21 compared to Intelligence Bureau figures.        
	Look Mr DG, do you think 21 lives are not precious? Chidambaram told the DGP, according to an IAS officer who was also present at the Union ministers review meeting here on January 31. Between January and December last year, the police claimed 185 deaths due to extremist violence, while the IB records pointed to 206.        
	Chidambaram, on his maiden visit to Jharkhand to get a first-hand account of the states efforts at curbing Left-wing extremism, was in for another shock while reviewing progress in centrally funded social schemes meant to win over the confidence of villagers affected by Maoist terror.The Centre releases Rs 15 crore annually for this project.        
	Chatra had been identified as one of the two districts for a pilot run, but the Union minister was dismayed to find that Alok Goel, an IAS officer and DC Chatra, wasnt present.         
	Instead, the district was being represented by Puja Singhal Purwar, now director, secondary education in the state HRD department, but formerly DC of Chatra for 10 months during 2007-08 when she is known to have done commendable work on the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme.         
	I am representing Chatra. I was deputy commissioner there for 10 months, Purwar told Chidambaram.        
	(But), why for 10 months only? replied Chidambaram, revealed the officer who was present.         
	It was done by the government. The then chief minister (Shibu Soren) took the decision, Basu interjected in a hushed tone.         
	Were you not consulted (as chief secretary)? the Union minister asked.        
	No, replied Basu.                     
	To this Chidambaram wanted to know whether he was shown the notification before affecting the premature bureaucratic reshuffle and why he did not protest against it.         
	For a seasoned minister like Chidambaram, this brief exchange and the silence thereafter was enough for him to grasp the realities of Jharkhand  at least prior to the imposition of Presidents Rule.        
	Purwar was unwilling to comment on her conversation with the Union home minister. I do not want to be a part of controversial things, she told The Telegraph over telephone from New Delhi.        
	Neither Ram nor Basu were available for further comment on the controversy, but state police spokesperson S.N. Pradhan tried to explain the discrepancy in casualty figures.         
	Differences like these are seen in records of several Naxalite infested states. IB may consider someone a civilian, but in police records things could differ. But now it has been suggested that we reconcile numbers between us periodically, he said.

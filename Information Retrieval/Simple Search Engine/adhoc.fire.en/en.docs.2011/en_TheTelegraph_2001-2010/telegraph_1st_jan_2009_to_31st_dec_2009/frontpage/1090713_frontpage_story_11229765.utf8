The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | More sucked into the frying PAN
                                                                                                           More sucked into the frying PAN
  - Rule to affect pensioners and others earning income from interest           JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                                    
	New Delhi, July 12: More people, including pensioners, homemakers and students, will have to furnish permanent account numbers (PAN) to avoid a deduction from interest or professional income even if they do not fall in the taxable bracket, according to a change proposed in the budget.        
	Those earning interest income of over Rs 10,000 or professional income of Rs 20,000 a year will have to furnish PAN. If they fail to do so, banks or organisations paying them professional fees will impose a penal rate of 20 per cent TDS (tax deducted at source) from April next year.         
	 Those who misquote their PAN intentionally or by mistake will also have tax deducted at the penal rate. TDS is otherwise 10 per cent of the interest or casual income.        
	As of now, those who did not have taxable income had to just submit a declaration to the banks stating that they didnt come under the tax bracket, and TDS was not applicable to their interest earnings. Such declarations will not be considered valid after April 1, 2010, unless the person furnishes PAN.        
	Most pensioners do not have PAN cards since they do not either earn enough to be taxable or are not interested in dabbling in property or securities for which you require a PAN. The new rule creates a lot of unnecessary paperwork for someone in the twilight of his life, senior chartered accountant Subrata Sen said.         
	Homemakers and college students earning interest on money in deposits or musicians with casual income did not need a PAN till now.         
	Under the new rules, they will have to either get a PAN or be taxed at 20 per cent on their earnings.         
	Officials, however, said a years time had been given to all individuals to get a PAN card and this should suffice as it hardly takes more than a week to obtain.         
	Practising accountants said that often clerks working for banks and companies who file TDS returns on behalf of depositors or casual income earners misquote PAN details.         
	The budget change now puts the onus on depositors or income earners to see that their PAN quotes are correct as it will be they who will have to suffer the higher rate of tax.         
	The officials said that TDS returns would eventually be dematerialised and with PAN details it would be easy to give tax refunds as well as plug loopholes if people keep deposits with different banks to evade taxes.        
	Kunal Banerjee, president of the Institute of Costs and Works Accountants, said: These are part of governance requirements. You have to eventually try and bring more and more people under the tax net. Mutual fund investments already attract the compulsory quoting of PAN just as share purchases do.

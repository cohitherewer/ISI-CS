The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Headley mystery meat for spy novel
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Headley mystery meat for spy novel
          OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES                                                    Shashi Tharoor, a sketch of Headley and Brinda Karat                                  
	Dec. 15: A young drug dealer turns a double agent, spying for the US and Pakistani militants and helping carry out the highest-profile terror attack in India, only to be arrested by the Americans so Delhi cant question him and find out all.        
	But wait, while working for the jihadis, he drops enough hints to the Americans who pass it on to Delhi, which cant prevent the 26/11 attacks because the information is too sketchy.        
	It may all be a bit rich for Shashi Tharoor  I havent read novels for a long time, he said tongue-in-cheek today but Indias junior foreign minister can hardly escape the conspiracy theories swirling about David Coleman Headley, from Philadelphia to Parliament to North Block.        
	If Tharoor wants to write a sequel to his 1989 book The Great Indian Novel, where he recasts modern Indian history as a latter-day Mahabharat, he might think of portraying Headley as the protagonist unveiling his leela as people die and nations squabble.        
	All the theories are agreed that Headley, 49, was both a US and a Lashkar-e-Toiba agent. Some say he was American spy agency CIAs man, others describe him as an informant of investigative bureau FBI, which now has his custody and has charged him with doing the recce for the Mumbai attack. Here are the plots from which Tharoor can choose:        
	Plot I: Stab in the back        
	The Americans knew but did not warn. Advocates: CPM leader Brinda Karat and some top investigators.        
	Karat today suggested in the Rajya Sabha that Headley had been a CIA agent since 1999 and the US government had helped him make frequent trips to Pakistan. The FBI too knew about his activities even before the Mumbai blasts. We want to know, did the FBI pass on real-time intelligence to Indian agencies? Karat asked.        
	Indian investigators said the CIA had been aware of Headleys Lashkar links for a full year before 26/11 but, to avoid him being exposed, failed to inform Delhi that he was freely travelling across India.        
	The FBI didnt tip off Delhi even when Headley visited India in March 2009, four months after the Mumbai siege, fearing he would be arrested and the cat would be out of the bag.        
	Plot II: US tried to help        
	Some government sources said the US agencies did give Indian authorities two inputs about possible terror strikes before 26/11  in September and October 2008  and on both occasions, Lashkar aborted its mission at the last minute. Top home ministry sources said the US had sent intelligence even about 26/11, and it could have come from Headley.        
	Telltale I: During his five India visits, Headley spent lakhs using credit cards issued by American banks as well as fake Indian currency probably brought from Pakistan, the investigators say.        
	To do: They are trying to find out who paid his credit card bills in the US banks.        
	Telltale II: Hasnt happened yet, but if Headley gets away with light punishment, it would be clear he had made a deal with the US agencies.        
	To do: Sources said if Headley got a jail term of just two to four years, Delhi would press for his hand-over after he served out his sentence.        
	Telltale III: The FBI has said Headley does not want to be questioned by Indian investigators, raising suspicion that its the US agency that doesnt want him grilled, sources have said.        
	To do: Karat asked why Indian investigators were being denied access to Headley when the FBI was allowed to interrogate Ajmal Kasab, the lone surviving Mumbai gunman. Did our Prime Minister raise the issue with the US President? she said, asking what the Centre was doing to ensure that Indian sleuths could question Headley at the earliest.        
	Plot III: FBI drug mole        
	The FBI had arrested Headley twice for peddling drugs, the first time in 1988, but each time his sentence was reduced because he squealed to save his skin and helped the agency uncover drug rackets, a US newspaper has said.        
	After his 1988 arrest for possessing 2kg heroine, Headley (then Dawood Gilani) had helped US drug agents set up a sting, the Philadelphia Inquirer said.        
	For over a decade, he stayed a confidential informant with the Drug Enforcement Administration. Gilani was so helpful on heroin imported from Pakistan that the prosecutors ended his probation years early, allowing him to travel freely. Within weeks, investigators say, he began training with terrorists in Pakistan.        
	Headley was again arrested in New York in 1997, smuggling drugs, and again got off with a lighter sentence by testifying against his partners.        
	Telltale: Federal prosecutors say Headley is co-operating in the investigation, which means he is squealing again. But by talking this time, Headley might escape the death penalty (for the Mumbai attacks), the newspaper has argued.         
	After his arrest, like before, Headley immediately switched sides. Prosecutors say he admitted taking trips to the jihadist camps and performing surveillance and photo reconnaissance for terrorist plots in Denmark and India, including preparations for the deadly 2008 Mumbai attacks, the paper says.

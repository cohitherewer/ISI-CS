The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Mahindra outbids L amp;T for Satyam
                                                                                                           Mahindra outbids L amp;T for Satyam
          OUR BUREAU                                               
	April 13: Scam-scarred Satyam today got a new owner  Tech Mahindra.         
	The company beat Larsen amp; Toubro and US billionaire Wilbur Ross with an offer to buy a 31 per cent stake in the software services giant at Rs 58 a share, pricing the deal at Rs 1,756 crore.         
	The overall payout will rise to Rs 2,890 crore if retail investors bite the bait and respond to a mandatory open offer to buy another 20 per cent at the same price. The open offer could cost as much as Rs 1,134 crore.         
	Tech Mahindra, a BPO and a unit of tractor and utility vehicle maker Mahindra amp; Mahindra, will acquire the 31 per cent stake in Satyam Computer Services, Indias fourth largest software services exporter, through a subsidiary named Venturbay Consultants in an all-cash deal.         
	Satyam, earlier owned by B. Ramalinga Raju, will first make a preferential offer of Rs 30.27 crore shares to Tech Mahindra to close the deal.         
	We took a lot of scenarios into account and weve taken a very calculated risk in making this bid, Tech Mahindra chairman Anand Mahindra said in Mumbai. We think they are reasonable risks were going to be facing.         
	Kiran Karnik, the chairman of the Satyam board, said Tech Mahindra would have to deposit the initial subscription amount and the requisite escrow amounts for the public offer on or before April 21. The bidding didnt go into an open auction as both L amp;T and Ross came up with low-ball offers. L amp;T had bid Rs 45.90 per share while Ross came up with a parsimonious Rs 20 a share.         
	An open auction would have been triggered if the second bidder had come up with an offer that came within 90 per cent of the top bid. Tech Mahindra is a joint venture between Mahindra amp; Mahindra and the UKs BT Group.        
	The Rs 3,605-crore Tech Mahindra, which counts BT as one of its biggest clients and specialises in offering solutions to telecom companies in Europe, was widely expected to lose the race to L amp;T, which was seen as the frontrunner.        
	The deal will first have to be ratified by the company law board that initiated the process to resuscitate the software company after its founder Raju confessed on January 7 that he had padded profits at the company by over Rs 7,000 crore for several years.         
	Tech Mahindra climbed 12.3 per cent to Rs 359.45 on the BSE. Satyam added 3.6 per cent to close at Rs 48.85.         
	We hope this signals the end of our nightmare and helps us claw back to the top, said Parshuram Netam, a software designer at one of Satyams units in Hyderabad.         
	Analysts expect Tech Mahindra, a relatively small player in the infotech space, to vault into fourth place behind TCS, Wipro and Infosys. However, Satyam will retain its independent identity, at least initially.

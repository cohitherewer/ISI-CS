  - Sonia returns honorary membership          SANJAY K. JHA                            Sonias Press Club card                                        
	New Delhi, Sept. 1: The Press Club of India today lost its most valued member: Sonia Gandhi.        
	The Congress president gave up her honorary membership, within days of receiving it, after the Press Club management that had conferred it on her was ousted on charges of corruption and other misdeeds.        
	This wasnt quite like the office-of-profit controversy that had prompted Sonia to resign as MP in 2006  and return triumphantly with a huge margin in the byelection.         
	This time, Indias most powerful person appears to have fallen unwitting victim to internal politics in an association of journalists.         
	The members of the discredited management flaunted their meeting with the Congress president and used their photograph with her as campaign material  dragging into the paltry puddle of Press Club politics a leader used to giant cut-outs and huge election rallies.        
	Sonias decision was announced in a letter to the Press Club management by Congress general secretary and media cell chief Janardhan Dwivedi, the man who had apparently persuaded a reluctant Sonia to accept the membership in the first place.        
	She has returned the membership card presented to her a few days ago.        
	Had this been America, Sonia and other Indian politicians would one day have been able to laugh over the episode over a cup of tea. US Presidents make it a point to attend the White House Correspondents Association dinner, where they are expected to make jokes at their own expense --- a tradition both George W. Bush and Barack Obama followed.        
	Its unlikely Sonia would ever be at a Press Club dinner to look at the lighter side of the controversy.         
	Congress sources said she was deeply upset at being dragged into the mess by Dwivedi. The Press Club management was sacked at an extraordinary general body meeting two days after it made her a member.        
	Party leaders were alarmed when media reports on the controversy referred to Sonia though, they said, she didnt initially even know about the move to give her membership.        
	Congress sources say Sonia is extremely circumspect about meeting unknown people and the party usually checks the antecedents of her guests. The meeting with the Press Club was arranged by Dwivedi.        
	The Press Club secretary-general, who met Sonia, had been under a cloud for a long time and the majority of journalists had turned against him. Dwivedi was apparently oblivious of these well-known facts.        
	The Congress tried to exonerate Dwivedi by arguing the problem lay with the media fraternity and that the party had nothing to do with it. But Sonia was apparently too angry to ignore the controversy.        
	Dwivedi, a long-time Press Club member, had surrendered his membership when he became a Congress general secretary. Some leaders have pointed this out to Sonia, asking why Dwivedi should advise her to accept the membership when he thought it better to give up his own membership.        
	There is speculation about Dwivedi being dropped in the next party shuffle. Sources said he would definitely be removed from the media department. Rumours of his resignation too were doing the rounds.        
	The Press Club has been entangled in controversies for many years with several management committees drawn into legal wrangles for misappropriation.

                                                                                                           Time-pass treats
										      Masala chips, jhaal muri, peanuts or bhujiya, Nondon Bagchi celebrates the immortal taste of quick bites                                          
	The first time I came across the word time-pass was in 1980 when a nice young lady at a small party asked me to pass some to her. It took me several seconds to understand what she meant, and when I did get around to passing her one of the bowls full of munchies that had been laid out, I thought of how singularly appropriate the term was, for the thousands of tonnes of food consumed each year by the human race  mood food, situation food  eaten with no concern for nutrition or the appeasement of hunger, but simply and literally, to add a bit of zing to the way we happen to be passing the time.         
	Time-pass is a subtle and deep subject, full of nuances and the variety is so mind-boggling that it would be worth a PhD to chronicle, classify and catalogue it all. It is the ultimate adda food; when I was a school boy, our home was the centre of a Scrabble adda and every evening, my parents and friends mainly, though we all pitched in at times, played several rounds of raucous, closely-fought, hotly debated Scrabble games. The redoubtable Mahasweta Devi who was in university with my mother and shared the same birthday, was a founder member of this adda with probably the highest per cent attendance and winning rate, and also among the more colourful personalities to be around.        
	Endless cups of tea would be consumed and for sure there had to be time-pass. What would these addas be without time-pass? How would they gel? They wouldnt. The most popular one was an all-time Bengali favourite, especially in households, easiest to concoct and perfectly delicious. Muri (puffed rice), chopped onions, chopped green chillies and a dash of salt all tossed thoroughly with a generous dose of mustard oil. Scrabble club members or not, we all had it by the fistful. Throw in some peanuts or dalmoot and you have variations.         
	My personal favourites, when it comes to this fine subject, tend to be the more traditional items. I simply have no time for the gaudily packaged, artificially flavoured discs, triangles and rhombuses, which are not even made out of a basic food like potatoes or other tubers, but from some edible, processed form of starch.        
	A friend who deals with similar products as part of his business told me he sold cheese balls that had not a molecule of real cheese in them; only flavours and essences were used. And the balls themselves? They would happily have used styrofoam, if that were edible.        
	But back to basics. Other local favourites which have existed for aeons are chanachur and dalmoot, terms which have become interchangeable over the years, for mixtures made from moong dal, peanuts, deep-fried squiggles of batter, spices and other ingredients. Available loose (that is sold by weight) at friendly neighbourhood groceries for years, there are now many packaged brands on shelves, my favourite being Mukhorochak, a quaintly packaged product with a picture of a gentleman who looks like a zamindar of yore. I enjoy seeing this product on supermarket shelves, next to all the glitzy products I mentioned earlier, beating them hollow for taste.        
	Then there is the incredible story of Haldirams, which began in the bylanes of Burrabazar in 1910  nearly a century ago. The first shop selling their products opened only in 1958, and till then, their trademark bhujiya being sold by hawkers from house to house. Today it is an enormous empire with food courts and Haldirams multiplexes, and their products are available worldwide. But I still like their original bhujiya  fine, delicate vermicelli-like deep fried batter squiggles on which the empire was built  the best.         
	Gujarati time-pass, like chewris and ganthia, and the South Indian murukku, are also hot favourites as are nuts of every variety, from walnuts, cashew, almonds and pistachios to the humble peanut. Nuts-wise, my taste is expensive, with chilgoza, or pine nuts, topping the list, though peanuts are probably the most versatile, combining easily with numerous ingredients.        
	Clubs in the city have their signature time-pass too; I came across Masala Chips at the Ordnance Club, which was quite a treat: chips (real potato wafers) topped with chopped onions and green chillies, sprinkled with rock salt and dried mango powder and garnished with chopped coriander.        
	One could go and on. But at the end, these are my top three situations for enjoying these delights. One is short train journeys, indoor addas, and of course, when we bend our elbows.

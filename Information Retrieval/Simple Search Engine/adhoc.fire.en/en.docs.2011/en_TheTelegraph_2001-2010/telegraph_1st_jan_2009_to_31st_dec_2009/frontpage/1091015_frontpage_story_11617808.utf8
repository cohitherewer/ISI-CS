The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Once familiar, now unsure

          G.C. SHEKHAR                      Ramakrishnan: Too many
  admirers                          
	Chennai, Oct. 14: Tamil Nadu can have no more claims to Nobel laureate Venkatraman Ramakrishnan except that he was born in the temple town of Chidambaram.        
	Reports that he had studied in Annamalai University prior to joining college in Baroda have now been found to be incorrect.         
	The day the scientist, now a US citizen working in England, won the prize for chemistry along with two others, a retired professor of physics had claimed that Ramakrishnan had studied pre-university at Annamalai University in Chidambaram, 220km from Chennai, and had taken the exams there in 1968.         
	Ramakrishnan, who had left Tamil Nadu when he was a toddler and grown up in Baroda where his parents taught at the Maharaja Sayajirao University, had yesterday rebutted reports that he had ever studied in Tamil Nadu.         
	Govindarajan, the retired professor who had made the claim, is suddenly not so sure. It is possible I confused him with another student with the same name, Govindarajan, now 80, said reluctantly after he was appraised of Ramakrishnans assertion that he had left Chidambaram when he was three years old and had no further connection with the town thereafter.        
	Govindarajan had, after hearing the news about Ramakrishnans Nobel win, described him as a shy young man who was among the class toppers of the pre-university group. But now he admits it may have been a case of mistaken identity.         
	With age our memory fails us and I was not really sure (if it was Ramakrishnan) when I saw more pictures of him in the newspapers the next day, the retired teacher said.        
	His daughter, Radhika, a professor in Dr. Muthiah Medical College of Annamalai University, now denies that she had ever claimed that she belonged to the same batch as Ramakrishnan.         
	I had only told mediapersons that I belonged to the same 1968 batch in which Venkatraman had studied. Even then I had clarified that I was not sure if this was the same Venkatraman since there were three students by the same name, Radhika said.        
	She also blamed the media for whipping up hysteria about the scientists Tamil Nadu links and digging up some academic connection between the Nobel winner and Chidambaram town.               
	The family was barraged by phone calls and reporters asking for interviews after somebody in the Annamalai University had tipped off that Venkatraman was a former student, recalled a neighbour.        
	The PRO of Annamalai University, who on hearing the Chidambaram connection, had jumped the gun and announced that Ramakrishnan had passed his pre-university from the institution in 1968, has now become incommunicado. Suddenly everyone is busy diluting, if not disowning, Ramakrishnans Chidambaram connection.

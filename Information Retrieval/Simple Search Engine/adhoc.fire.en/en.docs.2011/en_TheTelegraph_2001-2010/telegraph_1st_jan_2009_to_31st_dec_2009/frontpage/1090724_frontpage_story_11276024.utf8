The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Stay-home advisory to unwell children
                                                                                                           Stay-home advisory to unwell children
          G.S. MUDUR                               
	New Delhi, July 23: The Centre is planning to advise schools across the country to instruct parents not to send to classes any child who has symptoms of a cold, cough or sore throat  a new response to the pandemic swine flu.        
	The health ministry will issue an advisory to schools through the human resource development ministry, asking them to ensure that children with symptoms of upper respiratory infection avoid classes, a senior official said.        
	Over the past week, at least 42 children from several schools in Delhi and Pune have picked up the H1N1 pandemic flu virus. The infection in schools has prompted varied responses  one school asked classmates and bus mates of an infected child to stay home for five days, while another has closed for two days.         
	But health officials have said there is no need to shut down schools. There is no need for any panic. The scale of the infection in India today does not warrant school closures, said Vineet Chawdhry, additional secretary in the health ministry. But some precautions need to be taken.        
	A panel of senior government administrators decided that schools across the country would be sent a special advisory with the keep-sick-child-at-home instruction for parents. Were hoping it reaches schools over the next seven to 10 days, Chawdhry said.         
	A senior doctor said the new initiative could help delay the spread of the H1N1 infection, but would be hard to enforce. Parents and children in higher classes may be uncomfortable with the idea of not sending children to school for five to seven days, said Randeep Guleria, professor of medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi.        
	After the rainy season and in changing weather, the numbers of children  and adults  with such symptoms spike across India.         
	Medical experts believe the advisory through schools should also convey to parents that the H1N1 virus in its current form has predominantly caused only mild illness in most countries and that no treatment or even a diagnostic test is required.        
	Parents are in no position to determine whether an infection is H1N1 or seasonal flu or even common cold, Guleria told The Telegraph. But at this point, data show that patients with H1N1 recover even without treatment.         
	Health officials said school closures would not prevent the spread of infection beyond the few days of closure. Instead, the proposed home quarantine for a child who develops upper respiratory infections would help prevent the spread of not just the H1N1 virus but even the other myriad respiratory viruses that are far more common in India.         
	Some schools do ask parents not to send sick children to school, but such advice is rarely followed. It is a reasonable thing to do  whether for H1N1 or other viruses, said a health official. Such a practice would be reassuring for other children and parents.        
	India is currently isolating every confirmed case of H1N1 infection and treating the patient and close contacts with the anti-viral drug oseltamivir. Health officials have asserted that the use of oseltamivir is primarily intended to contain the infection.         
	The policy will change if widespread clusters of H1N1 emerge. The government will then stop testing every suspected case and provide the anti-viral treatment only to vulnerable patients with complications or chronic health conditions.         
	The number of patients with H1N1 flu in India has climbed to 371, with 29 new cases today. All patients so far have had only mild symptoms of fever, cold, and cough, and recovered after three to five days. But since it surfaced in Mexico earlier this year, the virus has caused more than 90,000 infections in 135 countries and caused 429 deaths.

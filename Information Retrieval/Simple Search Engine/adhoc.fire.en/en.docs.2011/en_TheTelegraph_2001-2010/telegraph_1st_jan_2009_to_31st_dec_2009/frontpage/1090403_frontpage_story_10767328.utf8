                                                                                                           Singh opens Obama chapter with book 
          AMIT ROY                            Obama and Singh during the meeting. (PTI)                                  
	London, April 2: Manmohan Singh went into his much-anticipated meeting with Barack Obama at the conclusion of the G20 summit today clutching a copy of a book written by the US President.        
	Although separated by some thirty years, the Indian Prime Minister, a far greater scholar than the law graduate, said humbly: Young people all over the world look up to you. Before leaving, my daughters said they wanted me to do them a favour when I met you. I said, What? They said, will you get him to sign his book?        
	The President happily obliged. It was not clear whether the book was The Audacity of Hope, a bestseller written by Obama.        
	The Indian Prime Minister said: I bring you greetings from the Indian President, Shrimati Patil.        
	Then he invited Obama to India with the promise: Please be assured a very warm welcome awaits you.        
	The President promised to take up the offer as soon as possible.        
	After their meeting, Obama took the giant hall of the Excel Centre to address the media, while Singh simultaneously took a side room. Some Indians defected to the Obama media conference.        
	I leave London satisfied that my bilateral and other meetings have been productive and useful, and that the G20 leaders summit has shown a way forward, said Singh.        
	Sources suggested that Obama was keen that India and Pakistan resume their dialogue process but Singh indicated that a minimum pre-condition  Islamabad would not allow its soil to be used to promote terrorism  should be met.        
	Singh told a questioner that he was pretty sure the Congress would emerge the number one party after the elections.        
	The Prime Minister made an indirect reference to the compulsions of a coalition government. I would be the last one to say we have achieved everything. There are lots of things we would have liked to accomplish. But there are compulsions, Singh said.        
	His meeting with Obama, Singh said, was marked by exceptional warmth and cordiality.        
	We reviewed our bilateral relations. I thanked President Obama for all that he has done in the US Senate and outside in the past few years to make possible the transformation of India-US relations, and to bring to fruition our civil nuclear initiative. Today, we discussed several positive and constructive steps to take the India-US global partnership forward, the Prime Minister said.        
	Singh added that he and Obama discussed regional and global issues, including the threat that terrorism emanating from our neighbourhood poses to all free societies, and the international efforts that are required to deal with this problem.        
	He continued: We had a significant convergence of views and approaches in his regard. President Obama informed me of the new comprehensive US strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan. I welcomed his clear enunciation of the problems and the goals.        
	The Prime Minister said he was more optimistic today than he had been last night. I was happy to note our (Indias ) views received wide acceptance and support.        
	But the Prime Minister admitted that he had been unable to win a bigger Indian voice in the IMF but confirmed India would not approach the organisation for funding.        
	He announced two achievements for India when he said there had been agreement on the broad direction for improvement in regulatory and supervisory structure for the worlds financial system.        
	They will be carried forward by the Financial Stability Forum and the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision, the two key standard-setting bodies. India is now a member of both bodies. Broadening representation in these bodies is an important improvement, he said.

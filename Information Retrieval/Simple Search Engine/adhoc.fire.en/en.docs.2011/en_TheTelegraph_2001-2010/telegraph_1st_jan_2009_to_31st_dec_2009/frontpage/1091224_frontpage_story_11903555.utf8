                                Big blow                            
	London, Dec. 23: Microsoft must amend its popular word-processing programme in order to remove a feature judged to breach copyright, a court has ruled        
	It means that Microsoft will be able to continue selling amended copies of Word, one of its most widely-used programmes. But from January 11, it cannot sell copies of Word 2007 or Office 2007 that use the disputed patent.        
	The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which deals with patent and trademark cases, upheld the verdict that Microsoft had breached a patent held by i4i, a Canadian software firm.        
	 i4i, based in Toronto, claimed that Microsoft willingly violated a patent granted in 1998 concerning methods for reading XML, a kind of programming language. XML allows users to customise the format of word-processing documents, enabling them to be read by various word-processing programmes. Microsoft Words ability to read and write XML documents is a key feature of the software.

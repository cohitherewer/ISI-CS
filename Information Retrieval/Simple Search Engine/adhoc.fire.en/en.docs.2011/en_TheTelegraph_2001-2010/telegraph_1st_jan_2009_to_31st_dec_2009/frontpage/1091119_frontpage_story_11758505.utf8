	Ranchi/Jamshedpur, Nov. 18: Jharkhand police have decided to seal its borders on all five voting days to prevent Maoists from sneaking in from neighbouring states, indicating the administrations apprehensions about rebel violence during the five-phase Assembly elections.        
	A series of security review meetings were held today with police top brass from various states, including Bengal, Chhattisgarh and Orissa. With Bengal, the state exchanged lists of criminals and Maoists as a means of monitoring the movements of wanted anti-socials.        
	Among those from Bengal who attended the meeting held at the office of the Ranchi senior police superintendent were western zone IG Kuldeep Singh, DIG of Midnapore range Piyush Pandey and SP of Purulia Rajesh Yadav.         
	IG of Ranchi zone Rezi Dungdung and DIG Raj Kumar Mallick, besides police superintendents of Ranchi, East Singhbhum, Simdega and Seraikela-Kharsawan, represented Jharkhand at the two-hour brainstorming session that began at 11am.        
	Dungdung confirmed that lists were exchanged with Bengal to enable the police to keep track of criminals and wanted Naxalites during the elections, but refused to divulge details.        
	Sources, however, said that todays was a preparatory meeting for Operation Green Hunt, a planned offensive against rebels to be conducted jointly by state and central forces. Police officers decided to keep track of the extremists during the elections to finally target them after the polls when a full-blown offensive was expected to be launched, a police officer confided.        
	The meeting also finalised deployment of forces and chalked out a detailed plan for pre-area domination exercises  the police practice of moving into an area five days before voting to keep a vigil on strategic locations along the state border.        
	In Jamshedpur, DGP V.D. Ram confirmed the administrations concerns when he said the police were apprehending large-scale disruptions by Maoists during the polls, because of which security forces would be deployed in large numbers in Saranda and Ghatshila.        
	He said this time, the police would be using choppers extensively. We have decided to use choppers for transporting para-military forces as well as poll personnel. The idea is to avoid being targeted by the rebels, he said.        
	On the Operation Green Hunt, Ram said the police and paramilitary forces had already launched a drive to flush out rebels from forests, but the exercise was being conducted in various local pockets that included red dens in the Kolhan region.        
	Rebel bandh call        
	Maoists have called a 24-hour state bandh on Friday against Operation Green Hunt.

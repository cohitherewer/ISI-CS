          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                              
	Pidrakuli (West Midnapore), July 24: Suspected Maoists abducted a policeman here this afternoon while he was travelling in a van to the Bhimpur police camp, adjoining Lalgarh.        
	This is the first instance of a policeman being abducted in West Midnapore.         
	Around 2.45pm, assistant sub-inspector Dipak Pramanik was returning in a hired van to Bhimpur after collecting water in two large tanks from the Pirakata police outpost 8km away. With him were the driver and his helper.        
	After travelling about 3km, the van was stopped by about 20 lathi-wielding people at Pidrakuli. As the men milled around the van, some others armed with guns emerged. They started questioning driver Banamali Mahato.        
	When they learnt the trio were headed for the Bhimpur camp and that one of them was a policeman, they asked Mahato to get off and join the helper at the back of the van.        
	One of the Maoists drove the van about 3km into the jungle. Mahato, who emerged from the jungle late this evening along with the helper, said that after a while, Maoists on motorcycles, guns slung from their shoulders, emerged from behind trees and started following the van.        
	When the van got stuck in the mud, Pramanik was ordered to get out and climb onto a motorcycle. The Maoists then set fire to the van.        
	Pramanik twice made a bid to escape but the Maoists caught him and beat him up mercilessly. Mahato said they trudged for an hour after the second abortive attempt till they reached what looked like a Maoist camp.        
	Once news arrived that the police had begun looking for Pramanik, the Maoists freed the driver and the helper and went away with Pramanik.        
	The police later said they and the CRPF traded bullets with Maoists from 7pm to 10pm in Kantapahari, Lalgarh, hitting at least two rebels.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | French pip Indians to Gandhi house
                                                                                                           French pip Indians to Gandhi house
                          Mahatma Gandhi                    
	Johannesburg, Oct. 7 (PTI): A house where Mahatma Gandhi lived for two years as a young lawyer here has been snapped up for $377,029 (Rs 1.8 crore) by a French tourism firm that outbid others, including Indian businessmen.        
	Even public-sector company Coal India Ltd (CIL) had evinced interest.        
	Voyageurs du Monde, which won the bidding held by Sothebys International Realty and is listed on the Paris Stock Exchange, plans to turn the property into a Gandhi museum, in line with its philosophy of investing in heritage properties worldwide.         
	The Indian government expressed disappointment that the house had gone to the French company but said it would continue efforts to acquire it. The matter concerns national sentiment and I will leave no stone unturned to acquire the property and declare it a national monument, coal minister Sriprakash Jaiswal said in Delhi.         
	The ministry, through CIL, was ready to pay any amount. Negotiations were on but unfortunately, despite giving a months deadline, they (the owners) did not contact us. The CIL board, he said, had decided that employees would part with a days salary for the acquisition.        
	Gandhi lived in the house from 1908 to 1910. The thatched-roof rondavel-style structure was designed by Gandhis confidant and architect Hermann Kallenbach.         
	The Indian businessmen who were in the fray, along with some Malaysian barons, are Gandhis followers.        
	The previous owners of the house, Nancy and Jarrod Ball, bought the house for 65,000 rand (Rs 4.05 lakh) in 1981. They sold it because they were shifting out.         
	The couple said they were relieved the buyer would be respecting the Gandhian heritage, a reason they had retained the houses original character.        
	Informally referred to as The Kraal, the house in the leafy suburb of Orchards is one of several places that Gandhi lived in as he developed his Satyagraha (passive resistance) philosophies and led the Indian community in South Africa in their struggle against oppression.        
	Lew Geffen, chairman of Sothebys International Realty, said it was not unusual for buyers to pay a substantial premium for a house of historic value.         
	He cited the example of a house in the nearby suburb of Houghton, whose value jumped from rand 4 million (Rs 2.4 crore) to rand 7 million (Rs 4.3 crore) after former President Nelson Mandela moved in across the road.

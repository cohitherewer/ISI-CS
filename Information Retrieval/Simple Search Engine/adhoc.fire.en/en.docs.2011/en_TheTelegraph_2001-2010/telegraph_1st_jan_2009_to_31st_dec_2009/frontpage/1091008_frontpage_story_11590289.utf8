The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Nobel rooted at home   Chemistry prize for Indian American
                                                                                                           Nobel rooted at home     -  Chemistry prize for Indian American
          AMIT ROY IN LONDON AND G.S. MUDUR IN BERLIN                                                    
	Oct. 7: Venkatraman Ramakrishnan thought it was a joke, especially the Swedish accent.        
	The Indian-born US citizen, who graduated from Baroda, had just been told over the phone that he had won the Chemistry Nobel, by a caller claiming to be from the Swedish Academy.        
	Well, you know, I thought it was an elaborate joke. I have friends who play practical jokes, the scientist, Venky to his friends, said from his lab in Cambridge, Britain. I complimented him on his Swedish accent.        
	But the 57-year-old who loves sugarcane juice was in for a sweet surprise: he had indeed won the prize, jointly with Yale professor Thomas Steitz and Israels Ada Yonath.        
	They had all independently mapped, atom by atom, the cells protein-making factories or ribosomes by using X-ray crystallography. Their feat has spurred the development of new antibiotics, thus directly assisting the saving of lives and decreasing humanitys suffering, the academy said.        
	The Indian is senior scientist and group leader at the Structural Studies Division, MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge  the same lab where James Watson and Francis Crick mapped the DNAs double-helix structure in 1953, a year after Ramakrishnan was born in Chidambaram, Tamil Nadu.        
	His work builds on Darwins theory of evolution and, more directly, on the work of Watson, Crick and Maurice Wilkins, who won the 1962 Nobel. Ribosomes produce the proteins whose sequence in the DNA forms the blueprint for life and controls the chemistry of all living beings.        
	Ramakrishnan is a fellow at Trinity College, which links him to another Indian Nobel laureate, Amartya Sen. A joke has it that a stone flung into Trinity is likely to fall on a Nobel winner.        
	Tamil Nadu has now caught up with Bengal in the Nobel stakes  with a little help from America. It has Ramakrishnan, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar and C.V. Raman to pit against Tagore, Sen and Mother Teresa. Bengal, though, can argue that J.C. Bose and Satyen Bose undoubtedly deserved the prize, that Raman did his pioneering work in Calcutta, and that Bangladeshi Peace Nobel winner Muhammad Yunus is a Bengali.         
	I have to say I am deeply indebted to all of the brilliant associates, students and post-docs who worked in my lab Ramakrishnan said modestly.        
	Well, Ill be honest with you. I was a theoretical physicist but my PhD work was on a problem that was not particularly interesting to me at the time. And I used to subscribe to Scientific American and found that there were all these wonderful discoveries happening in biology. So, I decided to switch.         
	Ramakrishnan said that because he had been inundated by calls in a laboratory, he was not able to break the news immediately to his own family. It looks like, from the way the phones ringing, that todays going to be written off. But I havent even told my wife yet. I couldnt reach her. Shes probably gone for a walk, and she doesnt use a mobile phone, so it will be interesting.        
	He is a fantastic person very popular among students and faculty here, said Umesh Varshney, professor at IISc Bangalore, where Ramakrishnan spent a little over two weeks last December.        
	He can talk to you at exactly the right wavelength, whether youre a senior faculty member or a young student, Varshney said, recalling how Ramakrishnan would visit a local stall to gulp down sugarcane juice.        
	The Nobel trio will split the $1.4 million (Rs 6.56 crore). Their work, which shows how some antibiotics block the bacterial ribosomes, may help tame drug-resistant bacteria and minimise the side effects of antibiotics.        
	Yonath said the trio were competitors but we meet a lot so theres a lot of interaction, and not always negative.                    WITH AP AND REUTERS INPUTS

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Tenders for VIP chopper
                                                                                                           Tenders for VIP chopper
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          Dhruv      
	Ranchi, May 5: The governors advisory council today directed the civil aviation department to float tenders to hire a chopper that would be used by VIPs on official work so that the states lone helicopter could be kept free for security forces during anti-Naxalite operations.        
	The decision comes amidst a raging controversy over politicians and bureaucrats widespread misuse of Dhruv, the states only helicopter, over the years.         
	The high court, which is hearing a PIL on the matter, regularly admonishes the state for trying to stall a probe into the extent of the misuse of the helicopter, which was bought from police modernisation funds to be used exclusively for relief and rescue missions during anti-rebel operations.        
	Today, the governors council turned down the civil aviation departments proposal to hire a chopper from any firm or service provider. In turn, it asked the department to float tenders and avail the services of the lowest bidder.        
	In his preliminary report to the court, the state accountant-general has confirmed that during April 2005 and November 2008, senior politicians, bureaucrats and their relatives squandered public money to the tune of almost Rs 35 crore on special flights made on choppers.        
	Apart from hiring chartered services from the private companies, several VIPs and their relatives had been using Dhruv regularly, at times denying the police its use during anti-rebel operations.         
	Last week, a division bench of the Jharkhand High Court headed by Chief Justice Gyan Sudha Misra told the state: If the chopper has been used by unauthorised persons at the cost of the public exchequer, the government should initiate certificate proceedings on its own against such persons and recover the money spent on their flying.        
	Today, addressing newspersons, cabinet secretary P.K. Jajoria said the state wanted to lease a chopper. But instead of taking it from any company, the governors council felt a proper tendering process should be followed.        
	Among the other decisions of the council today were:        
	Rs 19.91 crore approved for buying security equipment for the National Games        
	A consultant to prepare a plan for developing tourist spots with a proposed budget of Rs 65 crore        
	Eight new posts to monitor implementation of projects under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission

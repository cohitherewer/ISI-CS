The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Latehar officers shifted
                                                                                                           Latehar officers shifted
          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                              
	Ranchi, April 30: Three senior civil servants of Latehar were transferred today, ostensibly for having mishandled the election process, but the move had its roots in the pre-poll Maoist violence that led to the deaths of five villagers of Barahania on April 15.        
	Among those who were transferred today, the day after Governor Syed Sibte Razi entrusted Palamau commissioner A.K. Pandey to conduct a probe into the April 15 encounter, were deputy inspector-general of police (Palamau range) Nandu Prasad, Latehar deputy commissioner Sarvendu Tathagat and superintendent of police Hemant Toppo.        
	Home secretary J.B. Tubid defended the transfers, saying the three were shifted on directives of the Election Commission. They were transferred on administrative grounds related to election work. It had nothing to do with Maoist incidents, including the train hostage drama, he claimed.        
	S.N. Jha, posted at the Police Training College, Hazaribagh, will be the new Palamau DIG, while Ranchi SP (rural) Kuldeep Dwivedi will be police chief, Latehar. Rahul Purwar, the Ranchi Regional Development Authority vice-chairman, will replace Tathagat. Both Prasad and Toppo have been asked to report to the police headquarters. Tathagat has been kept waiting for posting and asked to report to the personnel department.                                 
	The posts of Ranchi SP (rural) and RRDA have been kept vacant, while Hazaribagh DIG M.S. Bhatia would take the additional charge of the Police Training College.        
	Understandably, the action against Prasad and Toppo hasnt gone down well with senior police officers. As for Tathagat, he happened to be away in Ranchi when the Maoists took a train hostage for four hours on April 22 to show solidarity with the Barhania villagers.        
	A senior IPS officer, requesting anonymity, said that the police top brass should have defended Toppo when it was clear that the incidents in Latehar had nothing to do with any error in his planning.         
	If an SP is transferred for any incident, then the responsibility runs higher in the hierarchy to IG to DGP. In that case, where does the buck stop? he asked.        
	Besides, it seemed the state succumbed to the pressures of Maoist outfits after the April 15 incident, he pointed out.        
	A Raj Bhavan official, however, complained that there was no co-ordination between Tathagat and Toppo during the elections. Prasad too was found to be biased as he came out with conflicting statements after the incidents.

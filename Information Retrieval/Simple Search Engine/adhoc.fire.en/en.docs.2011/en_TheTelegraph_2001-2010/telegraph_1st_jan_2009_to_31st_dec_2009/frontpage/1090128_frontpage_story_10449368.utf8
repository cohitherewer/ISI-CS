	Jan. 27: Ramalinga Raju wont be atop the magic mountain. Neither will be the titans of Wall Street.        
	Not long ago, at the World Economic Forums annual gathering in Davos, Switzerland, Wall Street veterans used to hold forth on the state of the global economy before mesmerised journalists and cowering subordinates while others mingled after-hours with the likes of Claudia Schiffer, the German supermodel.         
	As business, government and non-profit leaders trek up the peak originally made famous by Thomas Manns novel, but now better known for the gabfest that begins tomorrow, star power is no longer in.         
	This year, politicians, not corporate titans, are poised to be the big draw, echoing the broader power shift away from the free market as one government after another tries to prop up its sinking economy. More than 40 heads of state and government  almost double the number last year  will be joined by 36 finance ministers and central bankers.        
	The pendulum has swung and power has moved back to governments, said Klaus Schwab, the German-born economics professor who founded the World Economic Forum in 1971 and has been its impresario ever since. This is the biggest economic crisis since Davos began.         
	Raju was to have co-chaired a panel discussion at Davos, but he is behind bars in the wake of the Satyam scandal. Last November, Raju had co-chaired a Forum event in New Delhi, and had presented a paper on the need for a paradigm change in the BPO industry.         
	Rajus absence does not mean that a country of a billion and more will be under-represented. The Indian contingent this year has grown  from 80 to 85.        
	A total of 85 people, from the government as well as industry, are representing India this year, against 80 last year, said Chandrajit Banerjee, the CII director-general. Most industrialists want to learn how other countries are coping.        
	Many Indian regulars will be there this year, too, though their counterparts elsewhere will be fire-fighting at home.        
	It looks as if Schiffer and Angelina Jolie, another celebrity from the glamour years of the boom, will be absent.                    WITH INPUTS FROM NYTNS

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | May-June date for polls, schedule after March exams 
                                                                                                           May-June date for polls, schedule after March exams 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      N   Gopalaswami                          
	New Delhi, Jan. 11: The general election is likely to be held from the beginning of May with the staggered voting extending well into June, sources said.        
	The dates, they said, are likely to be announced before chief election commissioner N. Gopalaswami retires on April 13. After that, the process will be overseen by the next poll panel chief, Navin Chawla.        
	The sources said the election schedule was unlikely to be announced in March, when most states would be holding their Class X board exams. Since teachers form a major component of poll staff, the dates are likely to be declared after the exams.        
	Filing of nomination papers would take another 15 to 20 days.        
	The 14th Lok Sabhas term ends on June 1, and the Constitution allows six months till the formation of a new House.        
	Since the general election will coincide with Assembly polls in several states, voting is likely to be split into phases. The Election Commission will take a decision on this after consulting the security agencies and governments, the sources said.        
	Multiple-phase elections allow the commission to move the security forces to all the sensitive states and constituencies.        
	If there is a six or seven-day gap between phases, the entire process is likely to take 35 to 40 days, the sources said.        
	They added that rolls revision was almost complete in most states. Draft voter lists have been published almost everywhere for objections and corrections, the sources said, except in Chhattisgarh, Jammu and Kashmir, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Delhi and Mizoram, where the rolls were revised before the November-December Assembly polls.        
	Photo electoral rolls will be used throughout the country for the first time, and the voting is likely to be done through electronic voting machines at all polling booths.        
	The constituencies will be revised according to the recent delimitation except in Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Jharkhand, Manipur and Nagaland, where the exercise has been on hold.        
	House session        
	The final session of Parliament before the Lok Sabha polls is likely to be held next month, Union minister Prithviraj Chavan said in Nagpur today, reports PTI.        
	The last session of Parliament is likely to be convened next month for 10 days to pass a vote on account, the junior minister in the Prime Ministers Office said. He added that the session was likely to end by February 24 or 25.

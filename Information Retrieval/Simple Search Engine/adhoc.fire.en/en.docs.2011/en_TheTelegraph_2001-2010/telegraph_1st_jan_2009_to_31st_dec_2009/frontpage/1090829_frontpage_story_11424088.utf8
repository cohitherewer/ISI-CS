The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Dispur bid to solve hill crisis
                                                                                                           Dispur bid to solve hill crisis
  - Three-pronged approach on NC Hills        A STAFF REPORTER                                           
	Guwahati, Aug. 28: Dispur today stepped up efforts to find a solution to the troubled NC Hills district by holding a meeting of the three-tier Unified Command, another of the cabinet sub-committee set up to examine the demand for renaming of the district and chief minister Tarun Gogoi deciding to undertake a daylong visit to review the situation in the district tomorrow.         
	The developments, highly-placed sources said, go to suggest the seriousness with which Dispur was approaching the August 31 meeting convened by cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar and the September 1 meeting convened by Union home minister P. Chidambaram.         
	Gogoi is attending both the meetings along with state chief secretary P.C. Sharma and DGP Shankar Barua.         
	Gogois visit to the district is crucial as it would go a long way in helping Dispur firm up its response to the unilateral ceasefire offer by the DHD (J) and renaming of the district as demanded by the outfit, the official said.         
	The chief minister will be reviewing the overall situation in the district, meet the inmates in relief camps, besides representatives of influential organisations belonging to both Dimasa and non-Dimasa communities. It will help him get the latest mood in the district, the source said.         
	A source said the chief secretary-headed Unified Command, that plans and executes counter-insurgency operations in the state, deliberated for nearly two hours in the presence of Gogoi with members submitting their own report and trying to build a consensus on suspension of operations against the DHD (J), the three-month unilateral ceasefire of which is ending on September 7.         
	Though the members, he said, were for suspension of operations, they wanted that the ground rules be strictly adhered to in order to avoid future inconvenience. The views of the Unified Command will be compiled and submitted to Chandrasekhar and Chidambaram to help the Centre take an informed and practical decision.         
	Sources today said the state government would impress upon the Centre to declare the suspension of operations by the first week of September.         
	They claimed that the splinter group of the DHD (J) might be asked to surrender in Guwahati and that the DHD (J) will be offered safe passage so that they can surrender in Haflong.         
	The renaming of the district is a sensitive one. The government is mulling how the non-Dimasa groups can be placated if they rename the district. One school of thought is for renaming the district and setting up development councils for the other influential groups in the district for the sake of peace. Some kind of quid pro quo has to be worked out. It is still too early say which way the government will decide, the source said.

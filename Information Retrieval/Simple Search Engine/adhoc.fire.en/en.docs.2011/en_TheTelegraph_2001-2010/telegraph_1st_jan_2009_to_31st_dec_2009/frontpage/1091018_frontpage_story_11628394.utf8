                                                                                                           Rockets hit BC Roy, jolt CM
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 17: Rockets rained on BC Roy Hospital for children and the din elsewhere forced the chief minister to step out of his home to upbraid police as noise norm violations exploded with impunity on Calcutta on Diwali night.        
	The noise was so ear-splitting that Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee stormed out of his residence at Palm Avenue at 10.40 on Saturday night and asked police officers on duty to find out why loud crackers were being burst with impunity in the city. The chief minister then went inside.        
	Near BC Roy Hospital in Phoolbagan, Diwali revellers had a free run. Several rockets hit a window of the neonatal care centre at the hospital. Several newborn babies were jolted out of sleep and many started tossing around in beds, relatives and officials said.        
	 The parents of the children and the superintendent of the hospital complained to the police several times, sources said.        
	The situation here is extremely bad. I had twice made the rounds after I got complaints but no action was taken from the evening, which worsened the situation. I had also sought a report from the superintendent of the hospital as well as the police, said Biswajit Mukherjee, the special officer appointed by the high court to monitor noise pollution.        
	Officials of the pollution control board measured the ambient sound outside the hospital  a silence zone around 90 decibels, nearly twice the prescribed level.        
	We came to know from health officials inside that babies are shivering because of the loud noise of crackers, said a parent who did not wish to be identified. His four-day-old daughter is admitted to the neonatal ward with acute respiratory distress.         
	Nearly 50 parents complained that although they informed the police, little action had been taken since Friday night. We had blocked the Beliaghata Main Road last night when police officers came and promised us that they would look into the problem. But no action was taken even after the visit of pollution control officials on Saturday evening, a parent said.        
	Hospital superintendent M.K. Chatterjee has lodged a complaint with the police about the menace.        
	Sources said the police stirred only after Mukherjee, the court-appointed official, summoned senior officers of Beliaghata and Phoolbagan police stations to the hospital campus.         
	Although we located several highrises as the source of the fireworks, when we went to the buildings, we found them locked from outside, a policeman claimed.         
	Sources said an inordinate number of violations took place this year, possibly the worst since the norms came into being in 1997.         
	Over 420 people, including 350 in Calcutta and 73 in Lake Town and Salt Lake, had been arrested till 11.30pm for bursting loud crackers.         
	Highrise fire        
	A fire broke out on the seventh floor of a residential complex near Girish Park. A fire official said a burning cracker fell on a tarpaulin sheet on the roof. Four fire tenders rushed to the spot to fight the blaze.

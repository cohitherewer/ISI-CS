	Calcutta, Dec. 17: As Copenhagen sweats over an elusive climate deal, Calcutta is wiping beads of perspiration too, courtesy the shooting mercury and food prices.        
	The heat and humidity have been unusually high in the city for six straight days, with todays five-above-normal minimum temperature of 19.4C making it the warmest December 17 this decade.        
	If that marked a high jump from Wednesdays 16.4C, todays maximum too was three degrees above normal at 29.6C and the humidity ranged between 47 per cent and 94 per cent. Fridays minimum is likely to touch 20C, up six from normal.        
	Meteorologists have warned of three more warm days before some chill sets in by late Sunday or Monday, but added that the change might be temporary with winter continuing to play hide and seek.        
	Add to that the rise in food prices to a more-than-10-year high of 19.95 per cent, and the Calcuttan may be in for some frying times.        
	The warm spell since December 12 has been caused by the sudden formation of Cyclone Ward over southwest Bay of Bengal. The cyclones eventual dissipation  it stood as a feeble low-pressure area this morning  has not brought winter back to the city, though.        
	Copenhagen should take note: numerous weather anomalies attributed to global warming have made 2009 a watershed in Calcuttas recorded meteorological history. The city has seen a premature monsoon dragged in by Cyclone Aila, heat waves in April, May and June, record warm phases in August and November, an early winter and now a warm December.        
	A temperature rise this sharp was unforeseen, said G.C. Debnath, director of the Alipore Met office. He blamed a trough of low pressure, from coastal Tamil Nadu to central Bay of Bengal, adding a lot of moisture to the atmosphere over south Bengal.        
	A scientist from the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting, Noida, said the excess moisture was pushing up humidity, locking heat closer to the surface and hindering entry of cool, dry wind from the north.        
	Debnath said: Temperatures will start falling from Sunday night. They could nosedive from Monday, bringing back the wintry feel. That will happen as the low-pressure trough wanes, lowering moisture in the atmosphere, while a shallow western disturbance passes through south Bengal by Monday.        
	But meteorologists cautioned against taking the chill for granted. The wintry feel may not last beyond a few days, said the chief meteorologist of a private Met agency.        
	Debnath said central India too was much warmer than usual. The cool, dry northwesterlies, which must cross central India to reach us, are being obstructed midway.        
	Several Indian cities are witnessing unusual warmth. The minimum temperature overshot the normal by 5C in Agartala, Bhubaneswar and Gwalior, by 6C in Lucknow and Nagpur, and by 7C in Allahabad and Dibrugarh.                    INPUTS FROM G.S.

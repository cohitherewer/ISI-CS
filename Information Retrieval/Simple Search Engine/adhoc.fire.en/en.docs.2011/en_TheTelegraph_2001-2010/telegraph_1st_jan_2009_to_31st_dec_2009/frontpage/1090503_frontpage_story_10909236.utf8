The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Bengal Red Fort: As voice of discontent rises, the Party is in a rectification rush
                                                                                                           Bengal Red Fort: As voice of discontent rises, the Party is in a rectification rush
          MANINI CHATTERJEE IN DURGAPUR/BURDWAN                                              
	At Bimal Dasgupta Bhavan, the CPM office adjacent to Durgapurs gleaming City Centre, party comrades are unsure of the name of the Congress candidate contesting the newly formed Burdwan-Durgapur Lok Sabha seat. I think she is called Begum Nasreen, says one. No, corrects another, her name is Begum Nargis.        
	Nasreen or Nargis (it is Nargis), the Opposition doesnt really matter mdash; old habits continue to die hard in these parts, it seems.  
	If the districts of Bankura, Birbhum, Purulia, West Midnapore and Burdwan together comprise the Red Fort of Bengal, Burdwan is its very epicentre.          
	The district, which has witnessed a vibrant reindustrialisation process centred around Durgapur since 1994, is also the states granary mdash; land struggles of an earlier era and extensive rural credit schemes have led to high productivity. The fields are never fallow; rice cultivation through the year has turned the golden grain into a cash crop in many parts of the district.  
	After delimitation, the number of Lok Sabha seats in Burdwan has come down from four to three (Burdwan-Durgapur, Burdwan East and Asansol), with some segments becoming part of Bolpur and Bishnupur constituencies.  
	Burdwan has thrown up some of the biggest communist leaders of Bengal mdash; Benoy Choudhury, Harekrishna Konar, Rabin Sen, and currently Nirupam Sen among a host of others mdash; and the CPMs famed organisational machinery works better here than anywhere else, party insiders often claim.  
	That is why party workers are confident of retaining the Red Fort again, with the caveat mdash; If we lose even a single seat in Burdwan, it means we are losing Bengal.   
	Yet despite the workers confidence, party leaders betray no sense of complacency. The main reason for that is the jolt received less than a year ago during the panchayat polls. Compared to other districts, Burdwan fared well mdash; the CPM winning 59.34 per cent of the vote. But the loss of 70 (out of 270) gram panchayats and erosion at the lowest level of the panchayat system was bad enough, impelling the district leadership to go in for an intensive introspection and rectification campaign to repair the cracks that had appeared on the walls of their citadel.  
	According to CPM leaders, the panchayat election review showed that the main reason for losses was not the Nandigram and Singur effect as the media would like to believe. More mundane but disturbing reasons were responsible.  
	One was the lack of Left unity at the grassroots. Of greater significance, though, were the unpopularity of village-level party leaders and the structural problems emanating from new welfare scheme norms.          
	After the review, district-level leaders held interactive sessions in village after village to find out the causes of the peoples disenchantment with the CPM. One common complaint was that party activists had become arrogant the other was that CPM panchayat leaders often favoured their own when giving out BPL cards or choosing beneficiaries for various government welfare schemes such as Indira Awas Yojana and pension benefits.  
	As part of the rectification programme that followed these interactive sessions, village-level functionaries were told to mend their ways in dealing with the people and in some cases were removed from the party. The second problem is more intractable.  
	According to Amal Haldar, CPM district secretary, the central governments decision to divide the poor into BPL and APL (below and above poverty level) categories is itself flawed mdash; a man earning Rs 12.26 a day is BPL and one who earns Rs 12.29 is APL. If a man sends his child to school or has sanitation at home, or has four shirts, he is denied BPL status mdash; this is playing havoc with education and sanitation programmes in the villages because people would rather not go in for them if it means losing out on a BPL card.  
	And choosing beneficiaries out of hundreds of BPL cardholders is a bigger headache. The CPMs Durgapur MLA, Diprendu Chakroborty, points out that if there is a quota of just 10 per village for a particular scheme and there are 290 BPL card holders in that village, the remaining 280 are bound to feel deprived and accuse the local leaders of favouritism.  
	In order to minimise the problem, we have decided to take people into confidence at every stage as far as possible. There should be total transparency in choosing beneficiaries and the villagers should have a direct say, Chakroborty says.  
	Both Haldar and Chakroborty underline that this is what the CPMs so-called organisational machinery is all about. Regular monitoring, regular self-criticism, learning from the results of each exam (panchayat, Assembly, Lok sabha), that is what we do 365 days a year, says Chakroborty. Adds Haldar: Amra kaaj kori, kaaj korte bhool kori, bhool hole taar sanshodhan kori (we work, while working we make mistakes, and then we seek to correct our mistakes).          
	Trade union leader and former Rajya Sabha MP Jibon Roy takes the argument further. The CPM is not just a political party in this part of the world; it is a world unto itself. Earlier, we were involved in land struggles or the trade union movement. Now we are everywhere, in every field mdash; social, cultural, sports, education, entrepreneurship, womens development. Shukhe, dukkhe, janmo theke burning ghat porjonto, aamra thaki. (In sorrow and joy, from the moment of birth till the cremation ground, we are always with the people.)  
	That all-pervasive nature of the Party, we discover, can be both reassuring and oppressive. Just as the party benefits from the dedication of the bulk of its cadres, it also loses out because, over the past 30 years of continuous rule, many of them are seen to be arrogant or self-serving.  
	In Durgapur, the owners of Sova Ispat Alloys Ltd as well as its workers swear by the CPM. The owners talk of their problem-free relations with the Left Front government and the many subsidies offered to woo industry post-1994, while the workers insist that only the red flag is their saviour.  
	But as we drive from Durgapur to Burdwan and onto Katwa past fields laden with a golden harvest, farm labourers mdash; taking a break from cutting the crop under a sweltering afternoon sun mdash; are vocal with their complaints. The effects of the rectification programme have clearly not reached them.          
	At Nigon village (which is now part of the Bolpur seat) a group of men and women, who refuse to give their names, insist that this time they will vote en masse against the CPM because the local leaders only help themselves. No, they are not sure if things will be better under the Trinamul Congress but there is no harm giving them a chance, they say.  
	A little distance away, there are similar complaints of favouritism and arrogance against CPM panchayat members in Dormut village but the villagers make a significant comment. CPM party bhalo, kormi ra kharaab (the CPM is a good party, but its workers are bad.)  
	At Nasharathpur, a small kasba that falls under the Burdwan East constituency, a boisterous group of Trinamul workers are prematurely celebrating victory. The panchayat polls cracked the citadel mdash; now it is set to crumble, they exult, buoyed by the fact that for the first time in memory, villagers in the red zone are openly stating their decision to vote Trinamul.  
	In Katwa, Antara Banerjee, who works with an NGO, makes a telling point. This time Trinamul is making all the noise, the Partys supporters are silent.   
	The huge margins by which the CPM won seats in Burdwan are certain to come down, but it will still hold sway, she says, adding: They may face dents and bruises, but the only way Bengal can be without CPM is if the Party takes voluntary retirement hellip;.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                            Koda                                  
	Ranchi, Dec. 18: The Enforcement Directorate and the state Vigilance Bureau have been granted sanction to interrogate former chief minister Madhu Koda and his one-time cabinet colleague Kamlesh Singh.        
	The santions from the their designated courts came in no sooner than the five-phased poll process for the 81 Assembly seats drew to a close today  and within 24 hours of Koda and Singh, in judicial custody since November 30, being shifted from the ICU to a hospital cottage of the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences, Ranchi.        
	Special public prosecutor Sushil Ranjan Das said that prior to the actual interrogation, an ED team would visit RIMS to enquire about the medical condition of the two.         
	The designated ED court also rejected the bail plea of Vikas Sinha, brother of Binod Sinha, a close aide of Koda.

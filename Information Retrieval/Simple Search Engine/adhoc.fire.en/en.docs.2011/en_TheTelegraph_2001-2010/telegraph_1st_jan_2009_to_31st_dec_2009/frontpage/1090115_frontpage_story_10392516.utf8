The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Leaders meet Razi to thrash out solution
                                                                                                           Leaders meet Razi to thrash out solution
          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                              
	Ranchi, Jan. 14: Governor Syed Sibtey Razi today summoned Assembly Speaker Alamgir Alam and held parleys with leaders of various parties, including the Congress, JMM, RJD, Ajsu and Jharkhand Party, to understand better their positions in view of the current political scenario in the state.        
	The governor also held detailed discussions with director-general of police V.D. Ram. Jharkhand Party legislators Anosh Ekka and Raja Peter too met him. Ekka called it a courtesy visit. He admitted that his party favoured Presidents rule in the state.         
	Later, Ekka also drove to the Apollo Hospital along with Harinarayan Rai to visit the ailing caretaker chief minister Shibu Soren. They spent some time with him in the hospital, but refused to divulge details of their discussions.        
	A communiqu from the Apollo Hospital said that Sorens condition was stable and his blood pressure was under control.         
	However, a scan of his kidney performed today revealed certain abnormalities.         
	If things go well, we will release him tomorrow in the evening or the day after tomorrow in the morning, said the hospitals public relations officer, Javed Ansari.        
	Sources close to Soren said that he was reluctant to go to Delhi also because he had been refused an appointment with Congress chief Sonia Gandhi during his last Delhi visit. He was denied proper reception by Ahmed Patel and Ajay Maken. And, he met Lalu Prasad without an appointment.         
	Even before tendering his resignation, he wanted to talk to Sonia once over telephone, but to no avail. As suggested by the Congress and RJD, he selected his successor. But, the UPA leaders in Delhi are neither accepting nor rejecting his recommendation. He has great faith in Sonias leadership, correct information are not being passed on to her, a source said.        
	Union steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan too spoke to Soren over telephone in the morning and expressed solidarity. But, a belligerent Soren is unable to decide what to do next, even as his detractors claim to have lured his trusted lieutenant griculture minister Nalin Soren to Delhi.        
	Stephen Marandi, Saurabh Narayan Singh, Annapurna Devi and Niel Tirkey flew to Delhi by a service flight in the afternoon. One among them claimed Nalin too was accompanying them. Kamlesh Kumar Singh and Bandhu Tirkey flew to Delhi in the evening.        
	The leaders, according to sources, would impress upon their central leadership that Nalin too may be a right choice, or at least he was capable of compelling Soren to come to terms.         
	State Congress president Pradip Kumar Balmuchu too met Sonia in Delhi and claimed things would be set right in a day or two.

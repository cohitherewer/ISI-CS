The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | B-day gift: bigger IMF bite
                                                                                                           B-day gift: bigger IMF bite
  - Compromise gives developing nations near-majority say          K.P. NAYAR                            Manmohan with Obama in Pittsburgh                                        
	Pittsburgh, Sept. 26: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is returning home with the best birthday gift he could have got, not for himself, but for the country and for developing nations.        
	A big share of the credit for getting developing countries a near-majority say in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) goes to Singhs persuasive arguments at the G20 summit which concluded in Pittsburgh yesterday.        
	Singh, who sat to the right of US President Barack Obama at the G20 dinner here on Thursday, thanks to a draw of lots, made out a strong case with Obama in support of a long fight by developing countries to shift the balance of power in the IMF to reflect a changing world, US sources said.        
	Yesterday, he made a similar plea at a meeting with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, whose views carry considerable weight within the G20 in view of Browns long years as chancellor of the exchequer.        
	Besides, Brown had submitted a report in Pittsburgh reviewing the responsiveness and adaptability of international financial institutions to global crises.        
	Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, too, pitched very hard for changing IMF quotas in favour of his country, India and China at his bilateral meetings with G20 leaders.        
	The result was a compromise, Singh admitted at a media conference shortly before leaving for Geneva. En route, in mid-air, he cut a birthday cake prepared by Air India as his wife Gursharan Kaur and daughter Upinder Singh sang Happy Birthday with Montek Singh Ahluwalia, the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, and M.K. Narayanan, the national security adviser, in accompaniment, according to members of Singhs entourage who spoke from Geneva.                           
	A G20 communique issued here at the conclusion of its summit said: Modernising the IMFs governance is a core element of our effort to improve the IMFs credibility, legitimacy, and effectiveness. We recognise that the IMF should remain a quota-based organisation and that the distribution of quotas should reflect the relative weights of its members in the world economy, which have changed substantially in view of the strong growth in dynamic emerging markets and developing countries.        
	The communique added that to this end, we are committed to a shift in quota share to dynamic emerging markets and developing countries of at least five per cent from over-represented to under-represented countries using the current IMF quota formula as the basis to work from. We are also committed to protecting the voting share of the poorest in the IMF. On this basis and as part of the IMFs quota review, to be completed by January 2011, we urge an acceleration of work towards bringing the review to a successful conclusion.        
	Singh revealed that developing countries, including India, had argued in Pittsburgh for a seven per cent increase in their share of IMF quotas, which would have given them an absolute majority of 51 per cent in the organisations decision-making.        
	But European nations, which stand to lose rights from the changes, especially Belgium and the Netherlands, lobbied hard against the proposal.        
	The compromise was a five per cent rise in the share of developing countries, giving them a 49 per cent stake in the IMF. Singh said: We now have to address the issue of the Fund quota increase by early 2011, which has been set as the deadline for completing this task.        
	Britains Prime Minister said of the changes to global economic architecture, announced in Pittsburgh, that the old system of international economic co-operation is over. The new system, as of today, has begun.        
	Lula said: It is a sacred thing that is happening: The crisis is opening peoples minds.        
	Chinas vice-foreign minister, He Yafei, told reporters here that IMF reform is a bright spot of the Pittsburgh summit. The most important thing is to send a message, that is to say the (IMFs) governance structure and decision-making procedures should reflect the reality of the world economy today.        
	Singh disputed a reporters reference at his news conference about an economic crisis in India and said what India was experiencing was the fallout of the global crisis and a resultant loss of export markets.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | A Raj Bhavan occupant expelled, not evicted, by CPM
                                                                                                           A Raj Bhavan occupant expelled, not evicted, by CPM
          ANINDYA SENGUPTA                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 11: Psst, Prakash Karat. The list of occupants you may want to evict from the Calcutta Raj Bhavan has got longer.        
	Somnath Chatterjee, the former Speaker who was expelled from the CPM, is still retaining an office in Raj Bhavan after he got an extension from the governor.        
	By coincidence, the revelation has come at a time governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi, whose statements have angered Karats party, has met the Prime Minister and reportedly told him that he is not keen on an extension after the end of his current tenure in December. ( )        
	In 2004, when he assumed the Lok Sabha Chair, Chatterjee had urged the state government to explore whether he could have an office of the Speaker in Calcutta to deal with queries, requests and clarifications from politicians and common people whenever he was in town. Lok Sabha Speakers are entitled to a camp office in their home states.        
	The state PWD, which looks after office allotments including those at Raj Bhavan, had then complied with Chatterjees request, finding him an office there.        
	Chatterjees term as Speaker ended on June 1 this year, after which he requested the Bengal governor to allow him an extension of three months to clear his effects.        
	A few days before Somnathbabus term as Speaker ended, he had sent a letter to the governor saying that he needed three months for clearing out the Raj Bhavan office. After going through his request, the governor agreed, a source said.        
	Asked whether he was still in occupancy of the office, Chatterjee told The Telegraph: Yes. The Raj Bhavan office is still with me. I had sought an extension from the governor. He was nice and kind enough to agree to my request. As you know, the governor has the final word on Raj Bhavan matters.        
	Asked whether he would give up the office after the extension term ends on August 31, the former Speaker said: Certainly. My tenure ended on June 1. My extension deadline is August 31 and I will adhere to that. Actually, I had asked for time to gradually shift a good number of papers, documents, records and materials lying there. That takes time. Thats why I wanted the time extension.        
	Not that the state government, which still has a considerable number of admirers of Chatterjee who had tried to dissuade Karat from expelling him, has any problem with the former Speaker holding on to the unused office.        
	Asked why he needed a separate office when he has a house in Calcutta, Chatterjee said: My son is a lawyer and his chamber is in my Calcutta house. So, with me being the Lok Sabha Speaker and hundreds of people and politicians meeting me almost every day, it would have been difficult to manage from that house.        
	He said Santiniketan would be his permanent home from September. I plan to spend the rest of my life in Santiniketan, Chatterjee said.        
	According to a PWD official, the governor has the final word on allotment of offices or departments on the Raj Bhavan premises to eminent personalities or ministers.        
	When Viren Shah was governor, he didnt want the panchayat and the planning and development departments to be housed in one part of the Raj Bhavan premises. The planning and development department was then shifted to Salt Lake and the panchayat department to Jessop House in Dalhousie, the official said.

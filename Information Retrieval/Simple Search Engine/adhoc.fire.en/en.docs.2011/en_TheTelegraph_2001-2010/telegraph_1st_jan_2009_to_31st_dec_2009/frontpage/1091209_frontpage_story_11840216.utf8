  - Cong FIR against Soren son, Hemant 
  -   2 BSF men die in Naxalite attack 
  -   Over 55% turnout					 					      OUR BUREAU      
	Dumka/Ranchi, Dec. 8: A Maoist attack in Sikaripara that left two BSF men dead and an FIR against Shibu Sorens son Hemant, accusing him of kidnapping and beating up six Congressmen, marred todays third phase of polling in 11 seats in Dumka, Bokaro, Giridih and Hazaribagh districts that recorded an overall turnout of over 55 per cent.        
	Jarmundi in Dumka saw the highest turnout of 62 per cent, while the urban centre of Bokaro maintained the trend displayed in the earlier phases by logging only 41 per cent voting.        
	But the days story was the Congress-JMM rivalry spilling onto the streets with the Congresss Dumka candidate, Stephen Marandi, alleging that his rival and JMM candidate Hemant Soren, had kidnapped six of his party workers and beat them up early this morning.        
	And though five of his supporters were later released, the sixth Congressman, Derain Ram Das, was still in their captivity, fuelling suspicion that he may have been killed.        
	Marandi demanded the immediate arrest of Hemant and said he was going to sit on a dharna in front of the divisional commissioners office from today. After the polls are over today, I will sit on a dharna to demand the arresting of Hemant, he said.        
	The JMM, which holds considerable influence in and around Dumka and the Santhal Pargana, denied the charges, saying Marandi was dramatising the events since he was staring at defeat in the polls.         
	In an FIR filed in the Massanjore police station (case no 142/09), Congressman Sanjoy Upadhay alleged that Hemant, his bodyguard and 20 JMM supporters  they werent named  ransacked the partys camp office at Ranibahal, 36km from Dumka around 2.30am today.         
	He said Hemant then abducted and beat up six Congress workers, Pradeep Choudhury, Krishna Turi, Sudhir Pal, Shanker Pujahar, Munna Pujahar and Derain Ram Das. While five were let off in the forests around 3.40am, Das was still in their captivity.        
	We were preparing lists of voters when Hemant and his goons arrived here and destroyed our office, said Munna Pujahar, explaining that the violence was in retaliation of the Congress objecting to Hemant distributing blankets to voters yesterday.                                            
	They beat us up, while the others ransacked our office. Then they brought us to the nearby forests and set us free, but warned us against working for the Congress. As for Derain Ram Das, who wasnt set free, Hemant ordered his men to kill him, alleged Munna who claimed he had fractured his hand as a result of the assault.        
	The SP of Dumka, Arun Kumar Singh, said the police were on the lookout for those named in the FIR, including Hemant Soren. But, no arrest had been so far.        
	While Soren was not available for comment, the partys central committee organisational secretary, Suprio Bhattacharjee, alleged Marandi was making false allegations since he was looking at certain defeat.        
	It is a highly political and motivated step. Out of frustration, Stephen can cross any limit, he alleged.         
	By the end of polling, Massanjore police claimed to have detained former JMM MLA from Maheshpur, Sufal Marandi, along with three others near Ranibahal, for moving about in an unauthorised vehicle.        
	 These people were travelling around Ranibahal this afternoon on a vehicle without proper permission for which and we detained them, a police officer said, but clarified that these arrests had no connection with Marandis assault charge.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | B-schools get Sibal CAT call 
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                B-schools get Sibal CAT call 
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 11: A concerned human resource development ministry is meeting key IIM officials next week to evaluate options to restore the credibility of this years Common Admission Test (CAT), ravaged by glitches that troubled thousands of candidates.         
	The HRD ministry has called the directors of IIM Ahmedabad and Bangalore to a semi-formal meeting, most likely on December 16, aimed exclusively at desperate damage control, The Telegraph has learnt.         
	The IIM directors are likely to come to the meeting accompanied by some CAT organising officials from the faculty of the institutes, sources said.        
	The planned meeting is the first between the B-schools and the government since the CAT was ravaged by technical glitches during the first computerised version of the test.         
	It comes even as pressure mounts on the IIMs to scrap this years computerised test and re-conduct a paper-pencil version.         
	The faculty associations of the IIMs in Bangalore and Calcutta have both resolved in favour of re-conducting the test  in a paper-pencil form.         
	The ministry is expected to communicate that it has no objections to any move the IIMs make to restore the faith of candidates in the CAT, including scrapping the computerised test and re-conducting a paper-pencil exam.         
	These are desperate times. The question now is what we do from here on to mitigate the effects of the fiasco this year, a senior government official said.         
	In 2003  the only other occasion when the CAT faced a similar credibility crisis following a question paper leak  the then HRD minister, Murli Manohar Joshi, had insisted on a re-test.         
	Current HRD minister Kapil Sibal is unlikely to insist on any one mechanism to yank the IIMs out of the crisis, but is expected to communicate the governments concern.         
	The meeting is critical for the HRD ministry because Sibal and the government have faced barbs in both Houses of Parliament over the failure of a self-proclaimed IT power to conduct a computerised test.         
	For the IIMs, the meeting is crucial because it will allow the institutes an opportunity to try and win the HRD ministry over to their view that they had tried their best to conduct a fair test.         
	If they succeed, the embattled IIMs will have won support from the government, which would help them counter critics.         
	The meeting comes even as Prometric, the US-based testing service provider, today indicated that the number of adversely affected candidates could run into tens of thousands.        
	Over 8,000 candidates could not even take the test in their scheduled slot, but Prometric said it had identified at least 17,000 other students who have already been allotted new slots. But the firm is still conducting what it claims is a rigorous forensic analysis to ensure that every test result is valid and appropriate.        
	Students who suffered because their tests were declared quot;submitted quot; prematurely will also receive a second opportunity, Prometric said in its statement.

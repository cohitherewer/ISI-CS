	New York, Aug. 27: In a medical advance inspired by recessionary thinking, researchers from the Nicholas Institute of Sports Medicine and Athletic Trauma at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York city announced last month that they have developed an effective and supremely cheap treatment for chronic tennis elbow.        
	 Huddling a while back to brainstorm about inexpensive methods for combating the injury, the scientists glanced around their offices and noticed a homely, low-tech rubber bar, about 8 inches long, which, at the time, was being used for general physical therapy programmes.        
	They wondered whether the ribbed, pliable bars, available for less than $20, might be used to treat tennis elbow. The answer, it soon become clear, was a resounding yes.         
	To arrive at that conclusion, the researchers recruited 21 people with chronic, debilitating elbow pain. Ten of them were assigned to standard physical therapy treatment for tennis elbow; this was the control group.         
	The other 11 also received physical therapy, but in addition were taught a choreographed exercise using the rubber bar that they practiced at home. After less than two months of treatment, the researchers terminated the experiment. The early results had been too unfair.         
	The control group had showed little or no improvement. But the rubber-bar-using group effectively had been cured. Those patients reported an 81 per cent improvement in their elbow pain and a 72 per cent improvement in strength.         
	We couldnt believe how fast and well the therapy worked, says Timothy Tyler, a clinical research associate at the Nicholas Institute and one of the authors of the study.         
	 Tennis elbow, characterised by pain, weakness and inflammation or degeneration of the wrist-extensor tendon that connects to the elbow, is one of those intractable overuse injures that, until recently, yielded very reluctantly to treatment.         
	By most estimates, about half of all competitive tennis players will be afflicted, a statistic that must resonate, painfully, with the pros gathering for next weeks US Open.         
	Tennis isnt the only predisposing activity, either. Golfers get tennis elbow, as do plumbers, painters, gardeners and accountants. (Heavy briefcases can strain the tendon.)         
	Treatments range from acupuncture to corticosteroids to surgery, usually with limited  if any  long-term success. But in the past two or three years, doctors and researchers have begun focusing on a particular kind of exercise that has shown promise against other achy tendons, especially the Achilles. The programme involves eccentric exercises, which arent oddball moves but those in which the muscle lengthens as it tenses. Think of a biceps curl.

	Paris, May 6 (AP): Fashion designer Pierre Cardin has been hospitalised after fainting and falling earlier this week.        
	A spokesman for the Cardin fashion house said the designer was taken yesterday by helicopter to a hospital in Marseille, on the southern coast of France. Spokesman Jean-Pascal Hesse says Cardin, 86, is expected to leave the hospital tomorrow.        
	The designer underwent medical tests after falling last week as well. Cardin lives in the southern French village of Lacoste, where he has produced a theatre festival.

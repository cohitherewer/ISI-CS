	Gstaad (Switzerland), Nov. 28 (AP): Security experts today started preparing Roman Polanskis Alpine chalet for the movie directors house arrest while Swiss authorities consider whether to extradite him to the US.        
	A Hummer bearing the sign in French DR Securite Services was parked outside the empty three-storey building this morning, while three men and a woman took photographs of the property and spent about an hour inside.        
	They declined to say what they were doing, but the company handles a range of services from video surveillance to alarm installations and armored doors. One of the key court-imposed conditions of Polanskis house arrest is that he be fitted with an electronic monitoring bracelet that would detect if he tries to leave the chalet, which would cost him the $4.5 million bail he is required to post.        
	Authorities require that the bracelet be working before Polanski is moved to the chalet, probably on Monday. Until then, Polanski would remain in a jail outside Zurich, Justice ministry spokesman Folco Galli said.         
	An AP photographer was ordered to leave the area near the chalet today. You are on private property, a man from the security group said. Two local government workers were checking that the fire hydrant was working in the garden of the home, which is called Milky Way and has a stunning view of the surrounding Alps.

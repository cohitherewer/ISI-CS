                                                                                                           Ulfa peaceniks plan Delhi trip
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Guwahati, July 20: The pro-talks Ulfa group has decided to meet Union home minister P. Chidambaram in a last ditch attempt to salvage its move towards finding a permanent solution to the long-drawn insurgency problem in the state.         
	Sources close to the group said the leadership was afraid the trickle of desertion from its ranks may soon turn into a flood, putting paid to their yearlong effort of arriving at a negotiated settlement and giving the anti-talks Ulfa an opportunity to regroup in Upper Assam.         
	The pro-talks group is peeved with the Assam government for its alleged lack of sincerity in carrying the truce forward. The delay has made its cadres restive.         
	Two companies of the Ulfas lethal 28 battalion had declared truce in June last year for holding talks with the government. But till date, political negotiations have not started as the government is sceptical about the wisdom of holding negotiations with a splinter group.         
	Two cadres of the group, Akon Moran and Biplob Baruah, who were staying at the Kakopathar designated camp, deserted the ranks on Wednesday night, forcing the pro-talks leaders to take a hard look at the truce.         
	After waiting in vain for the state government to pave the way for the talks with the Centre, the group has now decided to take up their case directly with Delhi. It sought an appointment with home ministry officials recently, the sources said.         
	The group had come out of Ulfa at great risk to their lives and with very high hopes but nothing has happened since then. It has submitted a list of demands, which it wants to discuss with the government. But till date, the government has neither found the time nor appears to have the inclination to sit down for talks, a source said.         
	The pro-talks leaders now want to give the matter a last try by taking it up with Delhi directly, he said, adding, They have stuck their neck out too far and want to see something come out of it which could help restore peace in the state.        
	The development comes amid reports that Ulfa is trying to restructure its battalion to revive its sagging strength in Upper Assam.         
	A senior functionary of the outfit, Jiban Moran, has reportedly been given the responsibility to oversee the revival of the outfit. Moran is based at a camp that Ulfa shares with the NSCN (K) in Myanmar.         
	Police sources, however, said the pro-talks Ulfa cadres were deserting their camps and joining Ulfa not out of frustration over delay in taking the peace process forward, but because they were no longer able to earn money through extortion.         
	The lure of easy money is drawing the cadres back to Ulfa, a senior police official said.

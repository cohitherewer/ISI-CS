          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Barasat, Oct. 3: The Bengal government today announced companies would be allowed to procure farm produce from farmers co-operatives and self-help groups, a step that could help retail and wholesale investors bypass a powerful lobby controlled by the Forward Bloc.        
	The government said it would amend the APMC (Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee) act soon, as suggested by the Centre.         
	We are seriously working on it. The amendment could come before the winter session of the Assembly, Mortaza Hossain, the state agri-marketing minister, said. By his side were finance minister Asim Dasgupta and agriculture minister Naren De.        
	Retail investors such as Reliance, and wholesalers like Metro Cash and Carry and Keventer Agro, have been lobbying for an amendment to the act that allowed Bloc-controlled marketing boards to dictate terms or sit on applications.        
	Bengal is one of the few states still to amend the rules. The act, as it stands today, requires every farmer to approach a mandi (terminal market) designated by the agri-marketing board to sell the produce. Companies need APMC licences to buy from the mandis.        
	The amendment will enable companies to buy directly from farmers co-operatives instead of going to the mandis.        
	As co-operatives or self-groups will be involved, the government can claim that it has not allowed direct purchase by companies from individual farmers  something the Bloc is opposed to. But it remains to be seen if such groups will be free of interference from either the Bloc or whichever party that calls the shots in an area.        
	We want co-operatives or self-help groups, rather than individual farmers, to deal with big companies, finance minister Dasgupta said.        
	The ministers were attending the inauguration of Bengals first integrated cold chain project by Mahendra Jalans Keventer Agro in Barasat.        
	Dasgupta said the government was concerned with two factors: land ownership must remain with farmers and they must get a fair price.        
	Industry is happy. We can offer better-quality, fresh items in our stores. Moreover, we will be able to procure better products for processing, said retailer Kishore Biyani.        
	Ministers Hossain and De belong to the Bloc but the most vocal opposition to the big investors in retail had come from the agri-marketing board chief, Naren Chatterjee. Some officials said Chatterjee was spotted at the venue before the meeting started. But the seat for him remained vacant.        
	In the evening, Chatterjee said he had not gone to Barasat at all. I am in Baidyabati (in Hooghly). I dont know what is going on with the amendment, he said.

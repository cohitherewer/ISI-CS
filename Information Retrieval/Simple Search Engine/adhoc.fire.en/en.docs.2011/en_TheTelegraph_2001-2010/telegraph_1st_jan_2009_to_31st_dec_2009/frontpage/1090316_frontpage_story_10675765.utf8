The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Shilpa rush to see fading Jade
                                                                                                           Shilpa rush to see fading Jade
          AMIT ROY                            Shilpa and Jade: Little chance of a farewell meeting                          
	London, March 15: Shilpa Shetty is flying into London in the next couple of days for a farewell meeting with Jade Goody, her former adversary on Celebrity Big Brother. But the one-time reality television star is now slipping in and out of consciousness and may not be able to receive the Bollywood actress.        
	If Shilpa had really wanted to make a gesture towards the woman who is indirectly responsible for catapulting her to fame and fortune in Britain, it is unclear why she has left it so late since the British media have provided a running commentary on Jades deteriorating condition.        
	Max Clifford, who once acted for Shilpa, has for months been meeting the medias insatiable demand for almost an hour-by-hour medical bulletin on the progress of Jades cervical cancer (which has now spread to other parts of her body).        
	She wont be with us for long, Clifford told The Telegraph today.        
	Shes getting weaker, shes fading, but shes got a big heart which is probably why shes still alive. Were on the edge of a precipice, nobody knows when shes going to step off, whether it will be five minutes or five days.        
	He confirmed: Shilpa is coming in the next couple of days, perhaps on Tuesday. She wants to meet Jade.        
	Asked whether he thought Shilpa would be able to see Jade, Clifford replied: No.        
	He explained: She is asleep now. Only her mother (Jackiey Budden) and (her husband) Jack (Tweed) are with her. At the moment shes heavily sedated and most of the day she is deep in sleep.        
	A vicar was due to visit Jades home in Upshire, Essex, for a small private service and to offer prayers and blessings.        
	As for the quarrel between Shilpa and Jade, that was over long ago, a long, long time ago. They have become good friends. Over the last six to nine months, they have been in touch (by phone).        
	It is characteristic of Jade that her last days are being played out almost like the final episode of a reality television show.        
	Jade had made preparations for her funeral which she wanted to be a celebration of her life, Clifford said.        
	Shes the worlds first world reality television star, he said.        
	It will be a very Jade Goody event, exactly the way she wants it.        
	The funeral is expected to see a cortege of cars drive through the streets of Bermondsey, south London, where Jade grew up. She will be buried in the churchyard of St John the Baptist in Buckhurst Hill, Essex.          Jade had, at first, been content to leave the funeral arrangements to other people but had been unable to resist getting involved, chipping in with I dont want that and This is what I want.        
	The 27-year-old has also reportedly chosen her funeral music and hymns, including All Things Bright and Beautiful.        
	She wants everybody to be there, with plenty of room outside for (giant TV) screens, Clifford said.

	Howrah, Jan. 31: Yash Lakhotia, the missing seven-year-old son of a businessman, has been found murdered, suspected to be the cold-blooded reprisal of associates his father had fallen out with.         
	Yash, a student of Class II at MC Kejriwal Vidyapith in Liluah, went missing from his school on Thursday, January 29.         
	Around 7am today, residents of Foreshore Road spotted the body of a child in a bush  with bloodstains on the boys nose and a strangulation mark on his neck. The bush was about 2km away from Yashs home on Grand Trunk Road.         
	Doctors who conducted the post-mortem said Yash was killed between 3.30 and 4.30 this morning.         
	The residents who spotted the body said Yash was clad in a vest and shorts and had bruises on the right side of his forehead. Reclining sideways, one of Yashs hands lay under his head. There was a shoe on only one foot. Lying next to the body was a pair of tracksuits, which the police believe had been used to cover his school clothes so that he could not be identified.         
	The boy had a pale look and it seemed that someone had hit his head hard before strangling him, said Kanhiya Lal Singh, who was among those who spotted the body.        
	Doctors said there were no food particles in his stomach, suggesting his captors did not offer him anything to eat. Besides, one of his hands was broken. It seems the boy was subjected to physical torture and was strangled from behind, with a rope. The marks of a revenge killing were there, said a police officer.        
	Yashs parents, Anil and Anita, broke down when his body was brought home in the afternoon. The father clutched his sons remains.        
	Sleuths claimed the child knew the person who came to pick him up after school gave over on Thursday. His friends in school recalled that Yash, who usually returned in a car-pool, had referred to the man who took him as uncle.         
	The assassin must have realised that if Yash were released, he would spill the beans.         
	Even after Yash was kidnapped, no ransom calls were made which clearly suggests money was not the main motive. The abductors, it appears, wanted to kill the boy to settle scores either relating to business or family, said Neeraj Kumar Singh, the Howrah superintendent of police.         
	The police are looking for one Santosh Singh, a business associate of Yashs father.         
	We are looking for Santosh Singh, who was close to the Lakhotia family, helping with their real estate business, and is now missing. We believe Santosh is involved in the killing, said Neeraj Singh.         
	We have detained his nephew, Ganesh Choudhury, who works in Anil Lakhotias shop, he added.        
	Lakhotia has a sweetmeat shop, Panch Bhog, on GT Road.        
	The police believe Yashs uncle was none other than Santosh.         
	Santosh  in his mid-30s  had come close to the family over the years while handling deals for Lakhotias real-estate business in and around south Howrah.         
	The police said that of late Santosh had been demanding large sums of money for helping the Lakhotias in their business, which they had refused to pay.        
	This had caused a lot of bitterness between Santosh and the Lakhotias. We believe Santosh took his revenge by killing Yash, a police officer said.        
	Originally from Samastipur in Bihar, Santosh had been living in Naskarapara, Howrah.         
	Investigations have revealed that Santosh was wanted in connection with two kidnapping cases in Bihar. He is untraceable ever since Yash went missing.         
	The police have recovered Yashs school bag floating in the river off Shibpur Ghat. His tiffin box, books and pencil box were found inside.         
	Investigators believe the killers may have kept the child in one of the several godowns, some of them abandoned, dotting Foreshore Road.

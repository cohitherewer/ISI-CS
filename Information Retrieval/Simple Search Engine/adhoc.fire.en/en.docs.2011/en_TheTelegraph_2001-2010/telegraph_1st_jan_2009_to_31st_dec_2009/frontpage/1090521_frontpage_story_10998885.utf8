The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Education awaits super boss Manmohan
                                                                                                           Education awaits super boss Manmohan
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                             Brighter future?                                  
	New Delhi, May 20: Human resource development ministry officials dont know who their new minister will be, but they are preparing for a five-year stint that could see their real boss residing at 7 Race Course Road.        
	Even before a new cabinet has been sworn in, the ministry has resumed work on key projects that had been planned under the previous government but shelved with the announcement of elections and the prospect of a new government.        
	Normally, ministry veterans said, officials wait for the new minister to declare the priorities to determine their work plans.        
	But this time, officials have prepared a PowerPoint presentation to brief the new minister not just on the functioning of the ministry, as is normally the case, but also on specific projects in the pipeline.        
	There is confidence now within the ministry that the focus on education will continue and that the projects we were working on will go on. The reason is that whoever comes as minister, the real boss is likely to be Manmohan Singh, said an official.        
	Manmohan has never hidden his intentions of making education a priority. But officials say it was only in the latter half of the first UPA term that the Prime Minister started leaving his imprint on education, both in defining policies and in their implementation.        
	This time, officials expect much greater intervention from the Prime Ministers Office  from the very start. They also expect much less of the turbulence that followed the UPA replacing the NDA, with HRD minister Arjun Singh weeding out key officials perceived to have saffron leanings.        
	If the regime changes drastically, it can lead to a change in focus. Not because a particular party that comes to power lacks interest in education, but because each regime likes to leave its fresh imprint on the government, said a retired education secretary who is now an adviser to several government projects.        
	On a day-to-day basis, the new minister will be completely in charge, but officials are looking to Manmohan and his dedication to education to help push through projects envisaged over the past five years.        
	The Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2007-12), drafted by the UPA government, allocated unprecedented funds for education, outlining the greatest expansion in apex higher education institutions since Jawaharlal Nehru  all these at the initiative of the Prime Minister.        
	The Right to Education Bill, which makes primary education a legally attainable fundamental right, was debated for hours in the cabinet and Shastri Bhavan (HRD ministry) and Yojana Bhavan (Planning Commission). It was tabled in the Rajya Sabha in the last session before elections and has now been approved by a parliamentary panel.        
	Following the success of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, the UPA designed the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan to universalise secondary education by 2020.        
	Many of the planned projects  such as 14 world class universities among 30 new promised central varsities and the Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan  were proposed by Manmohan, a former teacher.        
	But the Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan, officially launched minutes before the elections were announced, is yet to take off and the Right to Education Bill needs a final political push to become a law.        
	Six promised new IIMs, 20 IIITs, nine NITs and the world class universities are yet to be cleared.        
	A lot of work and planning, evident in the dozens of files, has gone into these projects but the failure to implement them before the elections led to fears that the plans may be aborted if the government changed.

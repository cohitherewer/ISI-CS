	New Delhi/Ranchi, July 17: The Centre today pushed through the Rajya Sabha the proclamation for a six-month extension of Presidents rule in Jharkhand with assurance of an early Assembly election.        
	Home minister P. Chidambaram heard arguments on the sorry state of affairs in Jharkhand and diverted the brunt of attack on the BJP, before assuring Parliament that early elections would be held.        
	Had the Rajya Sabha not granted assent to the proclamation today, there could have been a Constitutional crisis as the House would be close for the weekend and the last date for extending central rule would have lapsed.        
	Although with a long debate on it and on the budget for Jharkhand, the UPA governments proposal was able to sail through. We will hold elections at the earliest opportunity available, the home minister said.         
	Earlier, the BJP opposed imposition of central rule in Jharkhand on the plea that things had not improved since Presidents rule was imposed on January 19. BJP leader Ravishankar Prasad said urban crime had shot up during central rule.        
	Left leaders felt the government would rather dissolve the Assembly and extend Presidents rule.        
	Independent MP Parimal Nathwani said the tribals in the state did not even have drinking water and demanded lakhs of check dams modelled on ones constructed in Maharashtra and Gujarat.         
	The Congresss Sushila Tiriya from Orissa said all tribals from Orissa or Chhattisgarh or Bengal looked at Jharkhand as their place of origin. She said when 5,000 schools did not get drinking water, how can one talk of development. Congress MP Mabel Rebello and JMM member Hemant Soren demanded the Centre to give Jharkhand a special package to achieve inclusive growth and improve living standard of common man.

          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                            Nitin Gadkari                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 21: A Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ideologue has publicly advised new BJP president Nitin Gadkari to learn from communists Prakash Karat and Harkishan Singh Surjeet.        
	These CPM general secretaries never contested elections or held parliamentary or legislative office, former Sangh spokesman M.G. Vaidya wrote in his Sunday column in Tarun Bharat, a Nagpur newspaper that reflects the Sanghs view.        
	The Sangh wants a clear separation between the BJPs organisational and political wings, with MPs kept out of important party posts, and Gadkari has recently had to deny reports that he is eyeing a Rajya Sabha seat         
	He, however, has yet to take a call whether he would retain his seat in the Maharashtra legislative council, and Vaidya was in no doubt what the decision ought to be.        
	The article asked Gadkari to resign his council berth. You must concentrate on party affairs with an eye to the 2014 polls. Parliamentary affairs are best left to (L.K.) Advani and (Murli Manohar) Joshi, Vaidya wrote.        
	He stressed that despite focusing on party matters, Karat and Surjeet were fully aware of the policy issues of the day. The implication was that a party official didnt have to be in the legislature to keep himself abreast of policies and planning.        
	Vaidya added that if there was a difference between the organisational and parliamentary streams, the organisational wing must prevail.        
	He also asked Gadkari to tweak the BJP constitution to bring it closer to the Jan Sangh charter, which demarcated sharply between the organisational and political/legislative arms. BJP sources said the party constitution had been adopted not from that of the Jan Sangh but from the Congress () constitution.         
	Vaidyas son Manmohan Vaidya, who heads the Sanghs publicity cell, explained: His (Vaidyas) views are not necessarily the Sanghs, but our top functionaries always reflect on them individually. Ultimately, its the BJP which has to take a call.        
	The legislature-organisation separation plan appeared to be at play today when Advani appointed general secretary Gopinath Munde as deputy leader of the BJP parliamentary party in the Lok Sabha. Munde and Gadkari, both from Maharashtra, have had a running feud and few expected Munde to be part of the new presidents team. Yet as a backward caste mascot, he could not be ignored. The Sanghs diktat came in handy here.

	Mumbai, May 12 (PTI): Over 50 Indian passengers flying Air France complained today that they had a harrowing time and were subjected to racial profiling after their flight was delayed in Paris.        
	The passengers said they were confined to a small airport lounge from 10pm on Sunday to 7am on Monday with little food and water after their plane developed a snag.        
	We were kept in a room with no food or water and we were told we could not leave. We spent a whole night over there in that condition, Vineeta Sengupta, who was on flight AF-218, said.         
	The airline has denied the charges and said the passengers were taken care of and given food and water.         
	Sengupta said: People were lying down on the floor where immigration takes place. No one would have been treated the way we were treated.         
	Other passengers were taken to hotels, she added.         
	The airline said soon after the take-off from Charles de Gaulle Airport on Sunday night, the pilot noticed vibrations in the cargo hold of the Airbus A330, carrying 169 passengers and 12 crew. He returned to Paris where the plane was checked and no abnormalities were found.        
	The passengers, travelling from the US, said the delay forced them to spend 28 hours in Paris. While other foreigners were taken to hotels after the plane returned to the airport, the 54 Indians were taken to the lounge and given a bottle of water and a sandwich each, they said.        
	The airline said it had put up passengers with valid transit visas at hotels for the night and had tried to obtain clearance for others, which was time-consuming.         
	A woman passenger said: When we said we would complain, one of the officials looked at me, up and down, and then said we could complain if we wanted to.         
	Another added: The officials threatened we would be handed over to the police if we did not stop protesting.        
	The Indians were later huddled out on a group visa and taken to a hotel, Sengupta said.

  - Attack follows fake surrender         OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Agartala, Nov. 10: The National Liberation Front of Tripura gunned down eight Reang tribals of a village in North district last night in a retaliatory strike.        
	Police sources said 10 NLFT militants had surrendered to state police and 15 battalion of Assam Rifles at Shantinagar under Kanchanpur subdivision and Ganganagar under Gandacherra subdivision yesterday afternoon.        
	In Kanchanpur, the seven self-proclaimed NLFT rebels who surrendered deposited a sophisticated INSAS rifle and 168 rounds of bullets and two magazines. In Gandacherra, three NLFT rebels surrendered and deposited a Chinese hand grenade, bullets of AK-series rifles and tax receipts.         
	However, a highly placed police official in North Tripura said the the seven who surrendered in Kanchanpur were not really NLFT militants.         
	These youths, all residents of Kusharambari village, had somehow overpowered a listed NLFT rebel Sadhan Jamatya, 27, who had strayed into their area and seized his INSAS rifle and bullets. Jamatya managed to escape and inform his NLFT colleagues. The retaliatory attack followed at midnight, he said.         
	Ten heavily armed NLFT militants stormed Kusharambai at midnight and rounded up eight tribals, all family members of the seven fake surrenderees, dragged them deep into the jungle near the village and shot them from point blank range. Three of those killed were women.        
	A large posse of police force rushed to the spot this morning and launched combing operations but the militants had fled across the still-unfenced border into Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh.        
	The bullet-riddled corpses were taken to Kailasahar district hospital for post mortem.         
	Security has been tightened all over north Tripura, a police source said.         
	The sources refused to comment on the alleged fake surrender, saying interrogations were on.         
	The deceased have been identified as Tularam Reang, 55, Sampaiti Reang, 48, Bidhanshari Reang, 17, Sanjit Reang, 22, Rabindra Reang, 21, Malirung Reang, 50, Tamarung Reang, 22, and Pramodrai Reang, 55. Pramodrai Reangs wife, Gayalung, 55, was injured.         
	DGP Pranay Sahay is in Kanchanpur to monitor the combing operations and redeployment of forces in Kushrambari. He will camp there till tomorrow afternoon.         
	The CPM has called a 12-hour Kanchanpur subdivision bandh tomorrow to protest against the massacre. Party workers staged demonstrations across the state against conspiracy to destabilise the state.         
	CPM spokesman and senior leader Gautam Das attributed the massacre to pre-planned conspiracy of the NLFT and its overground sponsors (meaning INPT) to destabilise the state before the ADC polls.         
	Regional INPT reacted sharply to the massacre and blamed the excesses of police for this.         
	INPT general secretary Rabindra Debbarma alleged that over the past few days Kanchanpur police had raided Kushrambari and grilled innocent villagers. He said they accused the villagers of feeding and sheltering NLFT rebels.         
	The tribals got scared and when they sighted two NLFT rebels yesterday they gave a hot chase, entering Bangladesh territory where they were encircled. The killing took place on the bank of the Deo river, he said.                          
	 close to the border, he said, adding that his party would send a delegation of leaders to Kushrambari for spot verification.         
	Police sources denied Debbarmas version and stuck to what they had said earlier.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Glare on $50m jet for bailed-out Citi 
                                                                                                           Glare on $50m jet for bailed-out Citi 
                                Vikram Pandit                            
	Washington/New York, Jan. 27 (PTI): A Democrat Senator has asked the US government to stop the Vikram Pandit-led Citigroup from buying a corporate jet for $50 million from a foreign firm because the bank is dependent on taxpayers money.        
	The notion of Citigroup spending $50 million on a new corporate jet, even as it is depending on billions of taxpayer dollars to survive, does not fly, Senator Carl Levin of Michigan said in a statement.        
	To permit Citigroup to purchase a plush plane, foreign-built no less, while domestic auto companies are being required to sell off their jets is a ridiculous double standard, Levin said.        
	US auto companies like General Motors and Chrysler have been barred from operating their corporate jets under a bailout package from the administration.        
	Citi is buying a French-made Dassault Falcon 7X luxury jet which seats up to 12 in a plush interior with leather seats, sofas and a customisable entertainment center, the New York Post reported.        
	There are just nine such top-of-the-line models in the US, and Dassaults European factory churns out three to four 7Xs a month, the report added.         
	I have urged Tim Geithner, who will presumably be treasury secretary by the end of the day, to do what he can to stop this absurdity from occurring, and I am assured he will look into the matter promptly, the influential Senator said.        
	The Post report said Citigroup was upgrading its jet fleet even though the banks stock is as cheap as a gallon of gas and its burning through a $45-billion taxpayer-funded rescue.        
	Citigroup decided to get its new wings two years ago, when the financial services giant was flush with cash, but it still intends to take possession of the jet this year despite its current woes, the daily quoted an unnamed source as saying.

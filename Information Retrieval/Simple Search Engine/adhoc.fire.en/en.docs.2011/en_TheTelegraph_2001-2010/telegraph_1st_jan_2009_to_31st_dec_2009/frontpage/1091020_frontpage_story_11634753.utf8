The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | All the news fit to tweet
                                                                                                           All the news fit to tweet
  - Newspaper uses Twitter to beat superban           AMIT ROY                            A protest outside the offices of Trafiguras lawyers in central London. (AFP)                                        
	London, Oct. 19: The Twitter can thumb its nose at more holy cows than Shashi Tharoor probably imagined.        
	The free micro-blogging service with an upper limit of 140 characters has allowed The Guardian newspaper to beat a court injunction not to publish a report.        
	In a Kafkaesque twist, the superinjunction had told the newspaper not even to report that it had been gagged. But a single tweet  a Twitter message  from the papers editor has not only revealed the story but led to it being circulated world-wide by an army of Twitterers.        
	The report was about how a UK-based oil trading company, Trafigura, had dumped a mountain of toxic waste in Ivory Coast, a poor west African country, making over 30,000 of its people ill.        
	So far, Twitter had helped organise political protests and expose abuse around the world while taking flak for defiling the sanctity of once-private spaces, such as a US jurys chambers or a players locker room.        
	The latest exploit  with the mass collaboration of total strangers on the Web in the words of Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger  suggests that in future, it will be virtually impossible to suppress information via the old methods of legal injunctions.        
	Twitters detractors are used to sneering that nothing of value can be said in 140 characters, a celebratory Rusbridger has written about his initial tweet. My 104 characters did just fine.        
	Tweets can be read on a computer screen or on a mobile phone and senders can restrict delivery to their circle of friends or, by default, allow open access.        
	After the story was out on the Internet, Trafigura saw no further reason to ask The Guardian to observe the injunction, and the newspaper published the full story.        
	The dumping of the waste was known but what The Guardian had  and was being prevented from reporting  was a copy of a Trafigura-ordered preliminary scientific analysis of what might have been dumped.        
	Trafigura, previously little known in Britain, had hired a firm of libel lawyers, Carter-Ruck, to get the injunction against the newspaper on September 11.        
	Last week, Labour MP Paul Farrelly raised the dumping scandal in the House of Commons and sought a ministerial answer. The Guardian was again advised that the injunction prevented it from reporting what had been said in the House  a gag that Indian media are immune from thanks to Rahul Gandhis grandfather.        
	So Rusbridger, before pushing off for dinner at the end of a hard days work, posted a tweet, teasing the Twitterers. Within the 140-character limit, he basically tweeted that he could not tweet very much more on what had come up in Parliament.        
	This was clearly an invitation to the Twitterers of Britain to unite, discover the alleged crimes committed by Trafigura, and reveal all.        
	The Guardians editor behaved like Sourav Ganguly in his moment of victory  he took off the journalistic equivalent of his shirt and declared: It took one tweet on Monday evening as I left the office to light the virtual touchpaper. At five past nine I tapped, Now Guardian prevented from reporting parliament for unreportable reasons. Did John Wilkes live in vain?        
	Wilkes was the scabrous hack and MP who risked his life to win the right to report Parliament.        
	Feroze Gandhi, outspoken MP and husband of Indira, did the same for India in 1956, getting a law passed that allows the media to report parliamentary or state legislature proceedings without fear of prosecution. The issue arose from whether newspapers could report a question by Feroze on the Mundhra scandal, a financial scam in Jawaharlal Nehrus cabinet.        
	Usually called the Feroze Gandhi Act, the law was repealed during the Emergency but was re-enacted in 1978. The Twitter, though, can be less risk-free in India than in Britain  junior foreign minister Tharoor had been rapped by his party for an irreverent mention of holy cows on a tweet.        
	Rusbridger said: By the time I got home, after stopping off for a meal with friends, the Twittersphere had gone into meltdown. Twitterers had sleuthed down Farrellys question, published the relevant links and were now seriously on the case.        
	By midday on Tuesday, Trafigura was one of the most searched terms in Europe, helped along by re-tweets by (well-known actor) Stephen Fry and his 830,000-odd followers. By lunchtime  an hour before we were due in court  Trafigura threw in the towel.        
	One of the quickest to reveal the full story was rights activist Richard Wilson, 34. He was baking a banana cake in his kitchen in London when he first found out about the gag on The Guardian from a message posted on Twitter, the newspaper said.        
	A few minutes of frantic Internet searching later he published the fact that the gag related to Farrellys questions about Trafigura. He also published the text of the questions itself and became so absorbed in cracking the puzzle, his cake burned to a crisp. He said it was a small price to pay.        
	A triumphant Guardian may now have a new motto: All the news thats fit to tweet.        
	Also, it seems the lawyers who have made a lucrative living for decades by threatening newspapers with libel action will now be rendered impotent by the new terror of the tweet.        
	But in calmer moments, Rusbridger and other newspaper editors, all witnessing declining circulations, may reflect on a worrying thought: If all that is worth knowing is available on Twitter, do people really need to buy The Guardian?        
	And the question is just 80 characters, too.                    INPUTS FROM SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY AND NYTNS

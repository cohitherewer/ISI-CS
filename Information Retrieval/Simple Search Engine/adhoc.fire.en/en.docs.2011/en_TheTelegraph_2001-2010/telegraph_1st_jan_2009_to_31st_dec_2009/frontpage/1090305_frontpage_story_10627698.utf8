The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | India medical mission to Lanka, 22 years on
                                                                                                           India medical mission to Lanka, 22 years on
          SUJAN DUTTA                                              
	New Delhi, March 4: India is sending a military-medical mission to Sri Lankas war-riven northeast in Delhis first overt intervention in the island nation since the disastrous peace-keeping mission 22 years ago.        
	The Indian medical mission will be based in Pulmodai, once part of the Tamil Tiger turf, where beleaguered civilians are now trapped between rampaging Sri Lankan armed forces and cornered guerrillas fighting to defend their shrinking patch of territory.        
	Delhis decision follows demands from Tamil Nadu where political parties have been alleging that the Centre was not doing enough to give aid to the victimised Tamils.        
	On February 24, the external affairs ministry prepared a note detailing the situation but a request was made to the defence ministry yesterday  a day after the general election was announced.         
	There is some nervousness in the government that this might attract allegations that the decision feeds into a political campaign.         
	In sending the medical mission, New Delhi is also making strategic calculations.        
	First, it is not abandoning its responsibilities as a good neighbour to Lanka with which it has historical ties. Second, it is trying to counter-balance the influence Pakistanis and/or Chinese have tried to capture by helping Lanka militarily after India decided not to supply lethal weaponry to the islands army. Third, India is putting into action its concern for civilians over warring parties.        
	The last time India had assumed an overt role in Lanka was in 1987. The Indian peace-keeping mission, codenamed Op Pawan, had started as a good samaritan venture but tailspun out of control into a bleeding tragedy for the armed forces.        
	The Indian medical unit in the northeastern coast will be given full security by the Lankan navy, officials of the host government have told the Centre. The external affairs ministry has asked the defence ministry to arrange to airlift the medical unit that is likely to be made of armed forces doctors and paramedics.        
	The number of doctors, nursing staff and paramedics is not known but it is likely to be sizeable because the defence ministry has been asked to airlift the contingent by deploying two Ilyushin 76 aircraft  the largest transporters in the Indian Air Force fleet  for at least a month.        
	The director general of military operations at army headquarters, the director general of the armed forces medical services, the assistant chief of air staff at air headquarters, a joint secretary and a logistics co-ordinator have been asked to oversee the operation.        
	The Lankan government has said that two buildings will be allotted to the Indian medical mission in Sri Lanka. The government will arrange accommodation but the team has been asked to carry tents, generators and equipment to function as a self-sufficient unit.        
	They have also been asked to ferry their own communication equipment even though the Lankan government is making electricity, piped water and CDMA telephone lines available.        
	The planners envisage that the team will touch down in Sri Lanka at Colombo and drive to Pulmodai through a country that has seen the worst of the battle and has now been recaptured by the Lankan forces from the Tigers.

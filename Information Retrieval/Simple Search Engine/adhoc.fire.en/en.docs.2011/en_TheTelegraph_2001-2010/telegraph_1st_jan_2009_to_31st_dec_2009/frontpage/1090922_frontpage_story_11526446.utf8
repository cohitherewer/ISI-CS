          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                             Javed Akhtar                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 21: The human resource development ministry has nudged the balance of power within the proposed Central Madarsa Board away from religious scholars towards educationists in a quiet shift under pressure from liberal Muslims.        
	The ministry has tweaked the composition of the board to bolster the strength of eminent educationists on the proposed body that for the first time aims to regulate madarsa education, government officials told The Telegraph.        
	The move comes less than a fortnight before HRD minister Kapil Sibal is scheduled to meet 59 Muslim MPs to discuss the legislation to create the board, viewed with suspicion by some sections of the community.        
	The change in the structure of the board is the result of pressure from liberal Muslims of eminence who asked why the government was stacking an education body with clerics.        
	Lyricist Javed Akhtar had criticised the earlier structure of the board at a meeting of the Central Advisory Board of Education (Cabe) earlier this month. Akhtar is a nominated member to Cabe.        
	The earlier draft of the Central Madarsa Board Bill, 2009, prepared by the HRD ministry envisioned a 10-member body consisting of seven clerics, a Muslim philanthropist and two educationists.        
	The HRD ministrys revised bill, which will be discussed with the MPs on October 3, proposes creating a larger, 15-member board.        
	The new structure allows the philanthropist and seven religious scholars to continue but adds five more educationists  taking their number also to seven.        
	What may tilt the power balance in favour of the educationists is the condition that the chairman of the body must be an educationist of eminence with contributions to madarsa education  not a cleric.        
	The structure of a landmark body like the madarsa board is critical to the shape it goes on to give to education at these seminaries. We believe the concerns over too many clerics on the panel may be justified, a ministry source said.        
	One religious scholar each from the Deoband, Barelvi and Ahl-i-Hadith schools of thought  the three most important Islamic schools in the country  will be members of the board.        
	The four other religious scholars on the board will be from the Imam Shafai sect (a Sunni group), the Shia sect, the Dawoodi Bohra sect and a cleric who has worked on traditional madarsa education.        
	The educationists on the panel should have made outstanding contribution in the social sciences, sciences, vocational training and education.        
	The board will steer clear of all theological concerns but will enjoy responsibilities in madarsa education similar to the combined mandates of the Central Board of Secondary Education and the National Council for Educational Research and Training.        
	Madarsas can voluntarily seek affiliation to the board but,once affiliated, will have to subscribe to its norms, including expert visits to scrutinise standards and audits.

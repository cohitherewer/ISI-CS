The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | The bitter aftertaste of lunch-box economics
                                                                                                           The bitter aftertaste of lunch-box economics
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, Feb. 22: Gopala Rao had hired five cooks and 20 assistants for his bustling catering service that fed software professionals of 10 IT companies.         
	Since 2002, the science graduate with a masters degree in computer applications has been delivering packed food  south Indian, north Indian and Chinese  in two Omni vans twice a day.        
	Rao, in his late-forties, supplied 1,000 meals to each of the 10 companies daily and earned a minimum of Rs 75,000 a month after expenses. He also operated a mobile canteen-on-pavement offering piping hot idlis, dosas and vegetarian noodles at the dead of night to techies who came out after late shifts.        
	Since November, Raos fortunes, like those of his clients, have slipped.         
	Five of his 10 clients cancelled their contracts in November, some others followed suit the next month. Rao sold his catering business in January when Dell, the last company he had as client, scrapped its contract with him.         
	My contract has been scrapped as employees are bringing their own lunch boxes and I have opted out of business, he said.         
	Rao now sells fruits and pickles on the pavements of Hitec City aided by his wife and son, an engineering student who helps out in the evening. His monthly earnings have come down to around Rs 22,000.        
	The relatives he had engaged in his catering business have all returned to their native villages in Guntur.         
	Raos tale of despair is being echoed across the service sector that had flourished around Hitec City, the hub of cyberabad.        
	The hundreds of guesthouses and service apartments that had mushroomed are now almost empty with occupancy rates plummeting to around 30-35 per cent because of the cost-cutting measures adopted by the companies.        
	I have to dispose most of my assets as I cannot maintain them, said Kondappa Reddy, a landlord who operated two guest houses and 10 service apartments.        
	Nearly 70 per cent of the service apartments have put up for sale notices. Real estate prices are down: a 1500sqft flat in and around the software corridor, that would have cost Rs 1.2 crore in the beginning of 2008, is now being offered for less than Rs 35 lakh.        
	I am shocked at the gloom and change that the downturn has brought to Hyderabad, said Neil Goblins, a visiting software professional from Ireland. He is, however, happy that he could hire a service apartment for less than $10 dollars a day very near his place of work. A year ago, the same place would have cost at least thrice as much.         
	According to statistics available with the Software Technology Park of India and the Hyderabad Software Exporters Association, almost 85,000 techies  of whom 5,000 are at the senior management level  have lost their jobs in Hyderabad since March 2008.        
	With layoffs and severe cost cutting measures in place, techies have now taken up teaching, some have opted to become grocers and even canteen operators.        
	Andhra Pradesh has some 445 engineering and 740 MCA colleges which have become shelters for some local jobless software professionals who are offering to teach at half their IT salaries.        
	In the last few years, we could get only aged techies to teach in our faculties. Now we have a fair number ready to teach at half the salaries, said Janardhan Rao, office-bearer of a consortium for engineering colleges.        
	The highest salary the engineering colleges have offered is just Rs 45,000 per month, that too on contract, Rao said.         
	The impact can be felt on other sectors as well. Almost 40 of the 75 and odd eateries around the Hitec City have shut down operations.        
	Many retail outlets selling fashion jewellery, electronic goods and apparels, which kept doors open 24x7 to cater to the techie crowd, have now returned to the normal work hours.        
	Most IT companies, particularly BPOs, have imposed restrictions on car pool and banned in-house catering, flower decorations and weekly on-floor recreation.         
	The request has come from the employees themselves after pay cuts that they can do without these fringes, said a management aide in Hitec City.        
	Jamine flower decorators of Jubilee Hills says it has lost a market of Rs 75,000 per month. Earlier we imported lilies and daffodils from US and England, marigolds from Uttar Pradesh, roses and jasmine from Europe to cater to our high-profile customers. We have stopped them from January onwards, said owner Abbas Khan.

          BISWAJIT ROY                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 29: Maoist leader Kishanji today said there was no major difference between the CPM and Mamata Banerjee.        
	The CPM is expected to malign us by insisting that we have connived with Mamata. For us, there is no major difference between the CPM and Mamata. The CPM is in power and has unleashed its harmads and police to crush us. Mamata is trying to come to power dislodging the CPM and lacks the cadre base. But I dont have any special expectation from her since I know her class character, Kishanji said.        
	However, Kishanji was evasive when asked whether Mamata and the Maoists were trying to use each other in their fight against the CPM.         
	Everybody tries to use everybody. But as revolutionaries, our goals are different, he said.

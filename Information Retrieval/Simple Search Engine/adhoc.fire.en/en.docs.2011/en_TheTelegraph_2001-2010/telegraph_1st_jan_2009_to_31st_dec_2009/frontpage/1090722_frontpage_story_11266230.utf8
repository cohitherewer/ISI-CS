                                                                                                           Week of starvation kills widow
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Ranchi, July 21: An elderly woman of Palamau, who had apparently stopped eating for the past seven days, died this morning, raising the spectre of a malnutrition death in the district that has already been declared drought-hit.        
	The 62-year-old widow, Raj Kumari Kanwar, was a resident of Rajharakharmi village of Patan block. Her son, who had gone away to look for a livelihood in Punjab, came back last month.         
	Palamau DC Amitabh Kaushal rushed a team of officers to the village, which is surrounded by deep forests and has 46 families, most of them poor.         
	Her son said Kanwar was not eating anything for a week. She was getting treatment at the local level. Had she come to a public health centre, she could have been saved, he said.         
	It appears a case of death due to illness and not hunger as she had picked up 35kg of rice under the Antyodaya Yojana on June 22, he added.

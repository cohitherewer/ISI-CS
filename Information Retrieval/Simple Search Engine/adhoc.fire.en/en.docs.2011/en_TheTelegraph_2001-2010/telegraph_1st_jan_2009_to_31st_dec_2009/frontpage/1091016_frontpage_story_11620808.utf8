	Ranchi, Oct. 15: The 34th National Games, scheduled to be held in Jharkhand from November 21 to December 5, has been postponed for the record fifth time, fuelling speculation about early elections and putting the Congress on the backfoot for looking as though it had acceded to what was a persistent BJP demand.        
	Announcing the postponement in New Delhi, Indian Olympic Association (IOA) president Suresh Kalmadi said that the National Games would now be held after the Assembly elections in the state, but insisted that the postponement had nothing to do with the sports infrastructure which was top class.        
	Kalmadi also said that no new dates had been decided for the Games. It (the postponement) is not because of infrastructure, top class infrastructure is ready. We decided to postpone it because election announcement is due any time, he said.        
	But, National Games Organising Committee (NGOC) working chairman R.K. Anand clearly indicated that election couldnt have been the reason for postponement.         
	Everybody knew the games dates and elections havent been announced as yet. As far as we know, the state government has not asked for a postponement, it has not expressed any fear of Naxalite threat, it has not demanded additional security. We were fully ready to hold the Games, he told The Telegraph.        
	Asserting that preparations were complete, Anand contested suggestions that Ranchi wasnt prepared to hold the games and that stadiums were in poor shape.        
	Governors advisor T.P. Sinha, who is in charge of the sports department, confirmed Anands assertion that the state had not asked for a postponement. The forthcoming elections could be the reason for rescheduling the games, he added.        
	But some officials and old timers still believed that Ranchi was ill-prepared to host the games whose preparations have been rocked by corruption charges all along.         
	Emboldened by todays development, the BJP took the moral high ground to seek a CBI probe into the alleged acts of omission and commission that led to the games being put off.        
	Let the Raj Bhavan clarify why it created confusion, said party spokesman Sanjay Seth.        
	After all Sinha is an important representative of Raj Bhavan. Moreover, IOA president Suresh Kalmadi, JOA chief Anand and national games steering committee chief Subodh Kant Sahay belong to the Congress. Their aim was to swindle money from the states coffers, he alleged.        
	Amid the political trading of charges, sports was the ultimate loser in Jharkhand. Those like former international Savitri Purty, who was coaching the state womens hockey team at Morabadi Astro Turf Ground, were furious.         
	I know the Games have been postponed again. But as far as Jharkhand womens hockey team is concerned, we will emerge winners whenever the Games are held, she said.         
	India international Sumrai Tete, who is representing the state at the ongoing sixth Jharkhand State Hockey Tournament  dubbed as a warm up tournament  said for players, such postponements were extremely discouraging.

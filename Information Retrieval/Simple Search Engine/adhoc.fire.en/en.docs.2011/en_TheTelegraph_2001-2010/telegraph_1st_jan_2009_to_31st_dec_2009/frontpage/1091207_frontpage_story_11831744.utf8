          OUR BUREAU                                          
	Calcutta, Dec. 6: Patients and their families in Bengal can expect quick compensation from private hospitals for medical negligence or inflated bills under new legislation the state government will table in mid-December.        
	Once the law is passed in the Assembly, a three-member tribunal will be set up to look into patients complaints and award compensation within six months of the offence.        
	The only forums for redress now are consumer courts and courts of law, where compensation or punishment is seldom awarded as hospitals keep dragging the cases for years through appeal after appeal.        
	That loophole remains even now: either party can appeal against the tribunals judgment in the high court within 60 days of the verdict being passed.        
	These provisions of the West Bengal Clinical Establishment (Registration and Regulation) Bill, 2009, will apply only to private medical establishments, including pathology laboratories. The government did not explain why state hospitals, from where most complaints of negligence come, have been left out. Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra merely pointed to the need to regulate the mushrooming private clinical establishments.        
	Nor do lapses by individual doctors at their chambers come under the bills ambit.        
	Under the bill, which will replace the West Bengal Clinical Establishments Act, 1950, the minimum compensation for death from negligence is Rs 5 lakh. If negligence causes injury  which in medical parlance means damage in general  the compensation will be between Rs 1 lakh and Rs 3 lakh, depending on the nature of the injury.        
	In disputes over medical bills or services, the tribunal will award a reasonable amount of compensation to the patient if the grievance is justified.        
	The bill reaffirms that no one can be denied life-saving treatment under any circumstances, including inability to pay the bill. But it allows the clinic the right to recover the cost from the patient or his representative in due course of time. No compensation amount or fine is mentioned in this context.        
	If a medical establishment runs without a licence, the bill imposes a fine between Rs 25,000 and Rs 2 lakh.        
	The state government will pick the members of the tribunal, whose term cannot exceed three years and who can be senior officials or retired judges. The tribunal can summon any doctor for consultation.        
	The bill, however, does not impinge on the functions of the state medical council, which can continue looking into complaints of medical negligence independently, and take its own decisions and actions.        
	The Association of Hospitals of Eastern India (AHEI), an organisation of private hospitals, will meet on Thursday to discuss the bills provisions. AHEI president and Belle Vue CEO P. Tandon welcomed the fines on unlicensed nursing homes but said even licensed ones needed to be monitored for quality.         
	He alleged that licensed dialysis units were mushrooming in the city but most lacked proper equipment, specially trained nurses and nephrologists.        
	On the provision against denying life-saving treatment to those who cant pay, he said: Treatment must be provided to critical patients but the law should protect both sides.        
	Many stressed the importance of the tribunals composition. It must have experts with the skills to ascertain the level of negligence, said Brig (retd) S.B. Purkayastha, CEO, Ruby General Hospital.        
	Prabir Basu, member of the state consumer protection council, Bengal government, welcomed the bill but said the tribunal must comprise competent people who can make proper assessment of a case.

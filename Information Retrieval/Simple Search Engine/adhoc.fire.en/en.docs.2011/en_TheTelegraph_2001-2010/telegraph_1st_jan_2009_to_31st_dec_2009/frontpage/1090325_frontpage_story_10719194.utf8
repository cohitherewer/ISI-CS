          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, March 24: For Nitish Kumar, George Fernandes is a spent force. For people, especially of Muzaffarpur, he is still the firebrand leader who first represented them in the watershed election shortly after Emergency was lifted in 1977.        
	Fernandess 90km journey today from Jaiprakash Narayan Airport here to his constituency assumes significance with hundreds of supporters chanting Nitish Kumar murdabad, George Fernandes zindabad.         
	The 79-year-old JD(U) leader was denied a Lok Sabha ticket by his party. Although Fernandes maintained silence on his reason for visiting Muzaffarpur now, his supporters  on a 40-vehicle convoy  dropped enough hints, even suggesting that their leader might be nominated by the people.         
	Like a father figure, Fernandes helped Nitish in securing the reins of the state. You can yourself see now a son declaring his father unfit for contesting the poll, Fernandess aide and former Union minister Digvijay Singh, who was also denied a JD(U) ticket, told reporters at the airport.        
	Nitish clarified that the party had all respect for George saheb.        
	But it has decided to keep him away from the rigours of campaigning in view of his age and ill-health, he reasoned.        
	But Fernandess supporters find it hard to stomach Nitishs explanation and interpret it as humiliation for the socialist patriarch. Jainarayan Nishad, who was allotted the party ticket, is not a youngster either. In fact, Nishad is almost as old as Fernandes  both were born in 1930  with the latter being senior by only five months.         
	Ironically, Nitish left for Delhi in the same flight, which brought Fernandes today.         
	Wives rule LJP list        
	Ranjita Ranjan, the wife of don-turned-MP Pappu Yadav, got an LJP ticket from Supaul Lok Sabha seat. Veena Devi, the wife of don Surajbhan, would contest from Nawada.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Gap in pledge to IIM amp; draft
                                                                                                           Gap in pledge to IIM amp; draft
  - Panel not to pick board members        CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                                    
	New Delhi, Oct. 26: Human resource development minister Kapil Sibals promise to hand over nominations of IIM board members to a proposed independent collegium of experts conflicts with his own ministrys plans, draft documents suggest.        
	The draft law that aims to create the appointments collegium  a panel of experts expected to be insulated from government influence  suggests that the body will steer clear of nominating members to boards of institutes.        
	If the draft law is passed without changes, the proposed collegium will have no role in appointing members to the boards of IIMs and IITs, currently appointed largely by the government. The institutes want selection of the boards to be freed from government intervention.         
	The collegium is aimed at rupturing a controversial umbilical cord that makes selection panels for education posts dependent on the government  and so potentially compromised in the choices they make.        
	The Telegraph has access to the draft law, the National Commission for Higher Education and Research bill, which aims to create an overarching regulator  the NCHER  and the collegium.        
	After meeting directors of the IIMs on October 16, the minister had announced that the collegium would recommend members to the institutes boards of governors.        
	But the draft law states that the collegiums role will be limited to proposals for executive posts in higher education  vice-chancellors of central universities, directors of IITs and IIMs, and regulatory agency officials.        
	The collegium will nominate members for a proposed new accreditation watchdog  the National Authority for Regulation in Accreditation of Higher Educational Institutions  apart from the NCHER.        
	Higher education department officials and sources refused to comment on the conflict between Sibals promise and the draft law, which the ministry plans to introduce in Parliament soon.        
	However, the HRD ministry is now said to be firefighting to resolve the conflict between its own plans and Sibals promise.        
	IIM boards may be allowed to pick members on the collegium who can then in turn assist the boards in picking their members  without the collegium as a body participating in the process.        
	The HRD ministry had specifically left appointments to the boards  of the IITs, IIMs or other top institutions  out of the ambit of the proposed collegium, sources said.        
	The collegium has been planned as a body of academic experts who will come together only when a series of appointments needs to be made.        
	The HRD ministry apparently did not want to burden the collegium with appointments to the boards  each of Indias IITs, IIMs and the National Institutes of Technology has a board with over 10 members on average.        
	The collegium, according to current HRD ministry plans, is envisaged as a body consisting of experts drawn from 15 diverse streams of higher education.

  - ICC rules provide for suspension but forget not BCCI ability to bring its influence into play          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                                      ICC chief Haroon Lorgat   in Delhi; Alan Hurst   (Ramakant Kushwaha, File picture)        
	Dec.28: Match referee Alan Hurst is understood to have given the Ferozeshah Kotla pitch an unfit rating, which, if the rulebook is followed, is almost certain to invite a suspension. Unless, of course, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) can pull strings at the highest level.        
	As the BCCI is perfectly capable of swinging things its way, the Kotla may not then actually be barred from hosting international cricket for a period of between 12 and 24 months.         
	All that is to be seen in the near future, though.         
	For now, the International Cricket Council (ICC) has given the BCCI 14 days to give its side of a messy story. Once that communication is received, chief match referee Ranjan Madugalle and the ICCs general manager (cricket), Dave Richardson, will decide on the penalty. The ICCs cricket committee chairman, Clive Lloyd, would have done Madugalles work had he not been available. A former Sri Lanka captain, Madugalle is currently doing duty in Australia but is expected to be in Dubai, the ICC headquarters, by January 20.        
	If both Madugalle and Richardson, who has served South Africa with distinction, are satisfied with Hursts report and arent impressed by the BCCIs reply, a ban is going to be slapped.        
	In that eventuality, the BCCI will have the right to appeal and its then that strings can be pulled. The strongest argument may well be that the Kotla is to host four matches in the 2011 World Cup and its too late to reschedule them. Also, that the next 14 months can be used to set things right.        
	Given the clout which the BCCI has in the ICC, its unlikely that the Kotla will really be suspended. Dont forget that the BCCI may just turn the tap off, so to say, and the ICC will find itself in a soup, quot; a source told The Telegraph this afternoon, a day after the abandonment of the final ODI between India and Sri Lanka.        
	The BCCI wont be unduly worried if the match referees rating is poor. For, then, the punishment for a first-time offender is a warning and/or a fine not exceeding $15,000.        
	Its perhaps significant that the BCCI has been having reservations over the ICCs functioning and the world body is aware of that. Should some in the ICC be firm on the rulebook being followed, troubled days are possibly ahead.        
	Meanwhile, many in the BCCI are upset with the Delhi and Districts Cricket Association (DDCA) for being instrumental in so much humiliation being heaped on Indian cricket.        
	The DDCA doesnt have a cricket culture. The emphasis is only on ensuring that the VVIPs and VIPs get their passes... Its unthinkable that an international match was played on an untested pitch, said somebody quite senior.        
	He agreed with former India captain Bishan Singh Bedis comments in this newspaper that while DDCA president Arun Jaitley had good intentions, he wanted to make peace with everybody.        
	It now appears that curator Vijay Bahadur Mishra, who quit last evening, didnt get along with the north zone grounds and pitches committee supremo Daljit Singh, who got sacked within hours of the fiasco.        
	If instructions, indeed, were disregarded, then a disaster was waiting to happen.        
	The BCCI, one learns, isnt going to penalise the DDCA till the ICCs ruling is known. For all associated with cricket in the country, its about waiting and watching.        
	Having fingers crossed, as well.

          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 31: Land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah today claimed he was super clean and could justify every action his department had taken on Vedic Village.        
	But his departments two actions, which lie at the heart of the controversy, go against the principles so far followed by the government on land distribution and legal perseverance, veteran officials familiar with the issues said.        
	At the crux of the matter is a decision by Mollahs department to lease out for 99 years, which means possession for a lifetime, 44 acres of vested land to Vedic Village, a resort.         
	Vested or government land is meant to be leased out only if the project involves public good such as hospitals or industry that benefits a large populace.         
	The norm is that vested land is leased out for projects like hospitals, highways or for setting up industries that will provide jobs to many people and ensure overall socio-economic development of the region. What public purpose does a resort serve? an official in Mollahs department asked today.        
	A former bureaucrat, involved with the land reforms of the Left Front government, pointed out: Ideally, the government, after vesting the land, should have distributed pattas and given away the land to landless farmers.        
	Why did Mollah go hammer and tongs at his own government when it was acquiring farmland in Singur? asked a serving official.        
	But Mollah, who has repeatedly questioned the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee governments drive to acquire farmland for industry, today shed little light other than asking tamely: Whats wrong if a resort or an entertainment centre is given land?         
	The second question at the root of the controversy is why Mollah reached an out-of-court settlement with Vedic Village after filing a case against it for submitting misleading information.        
	Vedic Village won a round in the high court in 2004 but the land department inexplicably opted for a settlement, showing rare alacrity for a government that hardly wastes a chance to fight legal battles to the finish in the Supreme Court.         
	The government had taken over the land  making it vested  on the charge that the Vedic promoters had tried to register it in the names of more people than was the case. After the settlement following the court ruling, the land was handed back to the promoters on lease by Mollahs department.        
	Mollah is understood to have told CPM state secretary Biman Bose that had his department gone to the Supreme Court in appeal, the case would have got stuck there for several years.        
	Such considerations for speed were not on display when the government fought repeated legal battles in the high court against banning polluting vehicles.        
	Officials said the legal opinion then was that the government would have won the case had it appealed against the high court order. Otherwise, why should the party that got the favourable ruling here agree to an out- of-court settlement with the government? an official asked.        
	But Mollah said the only way out was to lease the land for 99 years. For this, they even paid us 95 per cent of the cost of purchase of the land. So financially, too, it was viable, he said.        
	Mollah had not consulted either chief minister Bhattacharjee or the then CPM state secretary, Anil Biswas, before taking the decision on the settlement.

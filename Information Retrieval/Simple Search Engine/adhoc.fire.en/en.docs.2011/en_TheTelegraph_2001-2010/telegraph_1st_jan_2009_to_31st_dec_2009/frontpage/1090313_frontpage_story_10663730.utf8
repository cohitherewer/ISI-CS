          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                    
	Calcutta, March 12: The Congress and the Trinamul Congress finally struck an alliance that saw Mamata Banerjee stick to her guns and left a section of the Congress complaining about the partys surrender to her.        
	Although both Mamata and the Congress Working Committee member in charge of Bengal, K. Keshava Rao, hailed the alliance with the former welcoming it and the latter describing it as the beginning of a friendship, dissenting voices were heard in the Congress on the 28-14 Lok Sabha seat-adjustment formula.         
	Congress insiders said the party did not press the bargaining lever while dealing with Mamata but instead settled for a bad negotiation that could cost the Congress dear in terms of its organisation in south Bengal.        
	According to a senior Congress functionary, by not persisting with the one winnable seat in south Bengal issue, the party had thrown away two big advantages that could have strengthened its presence in the state.        
	One, the Congress is now in a much better position in national politics and it could have used that to leverage the negotiations with Mamata but the party failed to do so. Two, Mamata is in a weaker position in that she can no longer go back to the BJP because of the fear of losing the minority votes she had been able to garner as evident in the panchayat poll results last year.        
	In fact, she had to either go with the Congress or stay alone. That was an advantage the Congress had but could not use in the negotiations, said a Congress leader.        
	Therefore, questions are being raised in Congress circles on the shoddy and self-defeating manner in which the party leadership handled the negotiations with the Trinamul chief. Now that the seat adjustment is over, we should abide by that. But the south Bengal seats allotted to us are unwinnable and hence the formula is a surrender at Mamatas feet, said Congress MLA Deepa Das Munshi.        
	The state Congress had earlier insisted on being given at least one winnable seat from among Basirhat, Dum Dum, Krishnagar, Birbhum and Howrah besides the 14 that Mamata had agreed to give them. However, Mamata refused to budge and the Congress later decided against pursuing it.         
	State Congress working president Subrata Mukherjee partly echoed Das Munshi, saying: It would have been good had we got a winnable south Bengal seat. I dont know whether the deal would enthuse Congress workers or not.        
	Besides the six seats the Congress had won the last time, the party has been given the Jalpaiguri (SC), Burdwan-Durgapur, Arambagh (SC), Jhargram (ST), Bolpur (SC), Purulia, Bankura and Malda North seats.        
	Mamata today announced her list of 27 candidates, leaving one to the SUCI. Former PCC chief Somen Mitra will contest on a Trinamul ticket from Diamond Harbour.        
	I am happy and thank the Congress for being with us to oust the ruling CPM from Bengal. I am told that Pranab babu will be in town on March 15. I want to meet him and discuss the joint campaign strategy, the Trinamul chief said.

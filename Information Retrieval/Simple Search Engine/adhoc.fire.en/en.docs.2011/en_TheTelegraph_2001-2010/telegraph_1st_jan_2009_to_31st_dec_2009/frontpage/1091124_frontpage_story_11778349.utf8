	Haldia Petro and Citu on Monday night came close to an agreement to raise wages for contract labourers by 147 per cent over three years. An in-principle deal looked possible after talks at Writers that stretched past 2am. But when Haldia Petro said the deal had to be cleared by its board, an angry Citu demanded fresh talks. The deal had mooted the addition of a fourth category  highly skilled  to the existing segments of workers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Rail Singur nod with rider
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Rail Singur nod with rider
          OUR BUREAU                            Mamata, Bhattacharjee                          
	Dec. 9: The Railway Board has conveyed to the Bengal government its in-principle agreement to set up a coach factory in Singur but with the rider that it would need only the undisputed portion of the land.        
	Undisputed is a tricky label in Singur  the Left Front government feels no plot is disputed. It grudgingly accepts 147 of the nearly 1,000 acres were acquired from unwilling farmers  a figure disputed by Mamata Banerjee who puts it at 400 acres.        
	Railway Board sources in Delhi said tonight that after a meeting, the utility had sent a reply to the state governments proposal for setting up a coach factory in Singur.        
	The sources said that in the reply, the railways had said they were agreeing in principle to set up the factory but on the undisputed part. The minister asked the Railway Board chairman to send the reply, an aide to Mamata said.        
	Other sources claimed the reply mentioned the words world class  a phrase once used to describe the now-abandoned Nano plant in Singur to describe the proposed railway coach factory.        
	Contacted in Delhi tonight, state chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said he was not aware whether any communication from the Railway Board had reached Writers Buildings.         
	I will get to know only tomorrow after I reach my office, Chakrabarti said. But as far as the government is concerned, the entire Singur land is undisputed. There is no dispute over that.        
	Asked if the government would be willing to part with only 600 acres of the around 1,000 acres acquired for the Tata Motors Nano project, the chief secretary replied: I will not be in a position to comment on that till I have gone through the contents of the reply that you say the railways have sent me.         
	The Trinamul Congress has maintained that the government should return 400 acres of the acquired land as they belonged to unwilling farmers who had not collected compensation cheques.        
	If the government now insists that the railways will have to take the entire land, Mamata, who appears to be on the defensive after the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee governments googly yesterday, will get an excuse to wash her hands of the land.        
	However, if the government agrees to set aside the 400 acres and hand over the remaining 600 acres to the railways, Mamata will get an opportunity to claim that her case  that the 400 acres are disputed  has been vindicated.        
	The government will suffer some loss of face but it can also claim that since it considers the whole 1,000 acres undisputed, giving away 600 acres to meet the specified demand does not negate its stand.

  Tactics spill out, step by step          OUR BUREAU                                                    
	Sept. 8: Land shark Gaffar Mollahs luck ran out at 1.30 this morning after a fortnights cross-country odyssey, when police surprised and arrested the man behind the Vedic Village flare-up in a Bankura village.        
	The police claimed that Gaffar, traced through his cellphones IMEI number and held with five associates, had on his first day in custody implicated Vedic promoter Raj Modi and several politicians whom officers did not name.        
	He also graphically described how he bullied landowners into selling their land, sometimes at gunpoint, for Vedic Village and the now-scrapped Rajarhat IT township project, North 24-Parganas superintendent of police Rahul Srivastava said.        
	It has been established that Modi used Gaffars muscle power to forcibly grab land in the area, Srivastava said, adding the Vedic promoter also knew that weapons were being stockpiled in his resort.        
	What he did not know was the number of weapons being stocked. But the important point is that Modi knew that weapons were being illegally stocked in Vedic Village.        
	Srivastava said Gaffars methods of intimidating landowners went like this:        
	Biplab Biswas, assistant project manager at the resort, would call Gaffar over and, on a map, point out the plot that would have to be procured.        
	Gaffar would send a few of his henchmen and try to persuade the owner to sell. If he didnt agree, the gang would first build a road through the farmers land in a symbolic show of muscle power.        
	If the owner still held out, they would dump sand and bricks on his land, making it unfit for farming. When all else failed, Gaffars men would brandish their weapons and force the owner to sign the deal.        
	Srivastava said Modi was fully aware of Gaffars methods. Preliminary interrogation of Gaffar has revealed the close links that had developed between him and Modi over the years, he said.        
	Initially Gaffar used to deal with people employed by Modi. In the last two years, he had dealt directly with the Vedic Village promoter on several occasions.        
	Officers said Gaffar had helped Modi procure land both for Vedic Village and the joint-venture IT township in which Modi was a private partner.        
	The controversy that has shaken Bengals political and investment scene had broken out because Gaffar lost his head over an offside ruling at a local football match on August 23. His men began shooting, killing a teenaged fan, and then shook shelter in Vedic Village, prompting a mob of 700 to invade and torch the resort.        
	Gaffar has said the firing was necessary to assert his power, Srivastava told reporters. Gaffar thought that if he did not act tough after his team lost the match, his clout in the area would be eroded.        
	After the evening mob attack on the resort, Gaffar sent his wife and four children away in his Tata Sumo around 9pm  where the police do not know or will not say.        
	After the car returned, Gaffar and five associates got in and drove off on a journey that ended yesterday at Belbandi in Bankura, where Gaffars associate Hassanur Jawed alias Mintu has a relative, Bablu Sheikh.        
	An officer said Bablus sister Fazila Begum was a former CPM panchayat member. They probably thought the political connection would afford some protection. But we tracked Gaffars IMEI number and knew he was in the Indus area of Bankura, where Belbandi is located.        
	Gaffar and his associates were brought to Barasat this morning and paraded before the media. Among those arrested is Lakshman Ghosh, the man suspected to have fired the shot that killed the teenaged soccer fan. The four others too are Rajarhat toughs. The gang carried eight mobiles and 13 SIM cards.

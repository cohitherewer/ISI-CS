	Calcutta, May 28: An NRI mother and toddler quarantined for suspected swine flu after landing in Calcutta yesterday with cough and fever spent the night in a dirty, mosquito-infested male ward of a government hospital without food.        
	I am afraid me and my son will contract a serious infection, if we havent already. My father, who was at the airport to receive us, pleaded with the authorities to admit us to a private hospital but they wouldnt listen, Toronto resident Sushmita Biswas, 43, told The Telegraph from the Infectious Diseases Hospital in Beleghata.         
	Sushmita and her son Gibson, a year and a half old, had arrived from Toronto by a Lufthansa flight at 11.15pm yesterday. Both were coughing and running a temperature, prompting the medical team at the immigration counter to quarantine them.        
	I was honest when asked whether I was suffering from cold and cough. I had no idea that me and my son would be taken to this dirty hospital, she said.        
	Throat and nasal swabs drawn from Sushmita and Gibson were sent to the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases in New Delhi today and the results are unlikely to arrive before tomorrow.        
	What that means is that the mother and son have to battle a swarm of mosquitoes and sleep on soiled linen for at least another night. If a man with symptoms of swine flu is brought to the hospital over the next 24 hours, Sushmita and her son will have to share the ward with him. This is the only isolation ward we have for swine flu at the moment, a senior hospital official said.        
	Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra claimed his department was following international protocol in quarantining anyone with symptoms of swine flu.         
	We have to follow WHO guidelines, even if that means people with symptoms are inconvenienced, Mishra said.        
	Aniruddha Kar, the director of health services, said special arrangements had been made for patients quarantined at the Infectious Diseases Hospital. None of these arrangements was visible at the hospital, though.         
	This is supposed to be an isolation ward but hospital staff walk in and out without any protective gear. A nurse was kind enough to provide an oil cloth for my son but it was so dirty that I couldnt use it. As for the food, its not fit for humans, she said.        
	So, are people with suspected swine flu being quarantined in similar conditions in other cities, too?        
	Passengers arriving in New Delhi with symptoms of any respiratory infection are being taken to a new three-storeyed quarantine facility close to the airport, maintained by the central government. The building has air-conditioned rooms, isolation facilities and can accommodate up to 20 people, a health ministry official in the capital said.        
	Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital has similar facilities. In Mumbai, the designated facility for people with suspected swine flu is Kasturba Hospital, one of the better government-run healthcare institutions.        
	Calcutta doesnt have a similar facility. We have requested the state government to designate one but till that happens, patients have to be taken to the Infectious Diseases Hospital, a senior official said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Party of poor grapples with riddle of riches 
                                                                                                           Party of poor grapples with riddle of riches 
          JAYANTH JACOB                               
	New Delhi, Sept. 5: The CPM is considering a proposal to extend down the line a rule that functionaries should declare assets to the party at a time the Vedic Village controversy has dredged back questions about the lifestyles and acquaintances of some comrades.        
	The suggestion comes in the wake of allegations that the unaccounted wealth of some leaders, especially those at the local level, was one of the issues that alienated voters in Kerala and Bengal during the Lok Sabha polls.         
	In Bengal, the wealth of local CPM leaders had come under the glare after Maoists vandalised an ornate house of the partys zonal committee secretary, Anuj Pandey, in Dharampur near Lalgarh. The Vedic Village controversy had strengthened the perception that CPM leaders, while preaching austerity, were not immune to the charms of luxurious lifestyles.        
	If approved, the proposal will become part of a draft being drawn up to rectify mistakes. The draft document tops the agenda of a two-day politburo meeting that began in Delhi today.        
	Apart from Bengal and Kerala, the Andhra Pradesh unit of the party had also faced charges that comrades were being swayed by bourgeois tendencies and lifestyle deviations.        
	Now, only functionaries from the top till CPM state committee members have to declare their income to their respective committees. This practice is proposed to be extended to the local level.        
	Even if the proposal is approved  a smooth sailing is not a foregone conclusion as a Kerala leader had kicked up a storm by saying communists couldnt be expected to survive on vada, black tea and beedi, three fixtures that symbolised the frugal lifestyles of comrades of a bygone era  the declaration will stay away from the public eye. Right now, only the assets of those who contest elections are made public.        
	One issue that has been worrying the party is the life-style deviations and consumerist tendencies affecting party functionaries. It is a major issue at the local level as these leaders are the first contacts for the people to judge what the party and its leaders stand for. So there is a thinking to make them declare assets. But its a proposal that, along with others, will be discussed at the politburo and the central committee before the final call is taken, a politburo member said.         
	People do talk when local leaders in a village live in big houses, attend big parties and travel in luxury cars, he said.         
	Functionaries playing a role in real estate projects and acting as brokers is another issue the party is confronting in Bengal and Kerala  a far cry from benign professions like teaching that was the mainstay of its leaders once.

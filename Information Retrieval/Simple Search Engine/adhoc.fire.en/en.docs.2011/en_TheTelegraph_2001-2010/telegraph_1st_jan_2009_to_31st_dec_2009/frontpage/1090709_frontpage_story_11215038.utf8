The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Mission: Sell Delhi to kids
                                                                                                           Mission: Sell Delhi to kids
  - Adventure wont be easy on them, says incoming envoy          K.P. NAYAR       
	Washington, July 8: Tim Roemer, the incoming US ambassador to India, has an unusual problem.         
	His four children, between the ages of eight and 16, are reluctant to leave their school, their friends and their familiar home environment in America and be transplanted to an impersonal, protocol-bound, sprawling mansion in New Delhis diplomatic enclave of Chanakyapuri.        
	Roemer publicly addressed this problem on Capitol Hill yesterday at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.        
	With his two daughters and two sons sitting right behind him, the ambassador-designate spoke to them as he addressed his former colleagues on Capitol Hill.        
	I want to thank my four children here, Patrick, Matthew, Sarah and Grace. They range in age from eight to 16. And I want to thank them for their sense of optimism and adventure. This is not going to be easy on them, but they are beginning to get a little bit more excited about it. And they are looking forward to it, the concerned father reassured himself.        
	As Roemer spoke these words, one of his sons peeped over his shoulder to check if the words were really from his heart. They were.        
	The prepared text of Roemers deposition before the Senate panel did not have these remarks. In all probability, his children had seen the text or watched their father rehearse his speech and were surprised to hear the very personal remarks about his boys and girls.        
	The ambassador-designate departed from the prepared text to show his sensitivity towards what the children were feeling about being uprooted from America at an impressionable age and placed in a wholly unfamiliar environment.        
	Caretakers at Roosevelt House, the residence of the US ambassador on Chanakyapuris Shanti Path, have no recollection of any recent envoy from Washington who had small children playing on the lawns of the mansion designed by premier American architect Edward Stone.        
	That is something Roemer will have in common with his President, Barack Obama. Not since the Camelot days of John F. Kennedy has the White House had little children residing in it until Obama moved in this year with his daughters Malia and Sasha, who have become icons for their contemporaries here.        
	But it was clear that Roemer and his extended family are thrilled with his appointment as envoy to India. For yesterdays hearing, he seated full seven rows of his relatives behind him at the Dirksen Senate office building here, the seat of the Foreign Relations Committee.        
	Roemer joked in his remarks that if he introduced all of them to the committee, it would take all the time allotted to him to speak. He then introduced only his immediate family.        
	I could go on and on with family members. I probably should stop there, lest I start rivalling maybe the population of India.         
	The friendly, casual exchange was typical of the confirmation process for the new ambassador, who was handled with kid gloves by the senators as a former colleague on Capitol Hill.        
	Roemer served six terms in the US House of Representatives from Indiana. It was testimony to the respect he commands on Capitol Hill that the patriarch of the Senate, Edward Kennedy, yesterday placed on record a strong statement of support for Roemers assignment in India.         
	Roemer said yesterday that his parents, Jim and Marianne Roemer, always encouraged me to pursue the path of public service in the footsteps of Mother Teresa and Mahatma Gandhi among others.        
	The hearing was newsworthy for the assertion by Senator John Kerry, chairman of the committee, that secretary of state Hillary Clinton will, indeed, visit New Delhi in a fortnight.        
	There were doubts about her trip after Clinton fell down and fractured her right elbow last month.         
	Kerry appealed to the Senate to immediately confirm Roemer so that he could be in New Delhi for the Clinton visit. The ambassador-designate is expected to be speedily approved by the full Senate on Thursday, barring any unforeseen developments.

          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                             Seeking relief                                   
	Ranchi, Aug. 6: The state will seek a Rs 391-crore relief package from the Centre to battle drought.         
	Chief secretary A.K. Basu today left for New Delhi with a proposal for the Union agriculture ministry.         
	Adviser to the governor G. Krishnan, who holds charge of the agriculture department, told The Telegraph that it was a preliminary memorandum giving details of crop loss due to rainfall deficit.         
	The Centre will send a team to assess the situation and then sanction the relief package as incentive for loss of crops and subsidy for agriculture, he said.         
	Basu is slated to attend a meeting of chief secretaries called by cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar on Saturday. The meeting will assess the requirements of states and union territories that have faced less than normal rainfall, and draw up an action plan to meet the situation. It will also discuss the rise in prices of essential commodities, vegetables, fruits and milk.        
	Agriculture secretary A.P. Singh said that the state approximately required around Rs 900 crore to deal with the drought situation.         
	We will seek Rs 391 crore from the centre. The rest will be met from state coffers, he added.        
	The funds are meant for subsidy to farmers, fodder for livestock, special grants for the infirm and children and to ensure drinking water in both urban and rural areas.        
	This year, monsoon arrived in the state a fortnight late. The average rainfall received in July was as low as 29 per cent and this damaged crops, particularly paddy. We could achieve only 31 per cent of the sowing target fixed, Singh pointed out.        
	The governor declared the entire state drought-hit last month and directed officials to ensure that proper distribution of foodgrain.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Silchar, Aug. 29: Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi today made it unequivocally clear that peace talks with the Dima Halam Daogah (Jewel) could begin only if the outfit fulfilled certain preconditions.        
	The chief minister voiced his tough stand during a four-hour whirlwind tour to Haflong, the headquarters of North Cachar Hills district where the DHD (J) is active.         
	Gogoi, who reviewed the ground situation in the insurgency-hit district and held key meetings with top administration and security officials, stressed that the DHD (J) must stop all kinds of insurgent activities and extortion campaigns as a precondition to talks.         
	He said the group must also hand over all the arms before coming forward for talks. The arms will be deposited in an armoury, to be supervised by both police and the outfit.         
	Gogoi said the government had been receiving feelers from the DHD (J), expressing the outfits willingness to sit for a dialogue. But it would not accept any such offer unless the outfits leadership, and not a section of its cadres, came forward for talks.        
	DHD (J) chief Jewel Gorlosa, was arrested along with another leader, Partho Warisa, from Bangalore in June this year, forcing the outfits lower ranked cadres to declare a unilateral ceasefire. Dispur, however, continued its operation against the outfit. The unilateral ceasefire, declared by the DHD (J) in North Cachar Hills for three months, will expire on September 7.        
	Gogoi also made it clear that Dispur would not agree to the demand of renaming North Cachar Hills into Dima Hajao Raji and that the district would not suffer any vivisection in future.        
	The chief minister expressed satisfaction over the visible improvement in law and order in the district in the past three months.        
	He assured tribal leaders that measures would be taken to usher in peace, rehabilitate violence-hit people and chalk out a special development package for the district. He directed officials to provide baby food and educational facilities to children in relief camps and enrol villagers living in these camps for rehabilitation.         
	He held detailed discussions with representatives of the district units of the Congress, the ASDC and the AGP.        
	Gogoi was accompanied by chief secretary P.C. Sarma, DGP S. Barua, additional chief secretary P.P. Verma and inspectors-general of police B.J. Mahanta and P.P. Singh.

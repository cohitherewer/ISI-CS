	Mumbai, Dec. 4: Actress Monica Bedi, deported with gangster Abu Salem from Portugal in 2005, can now access her money lying in five fixed deposits and two savings accounts in a Mumbai bank.        
	The CBI today told Bombay High Court it had no objection to de-freezing the accounts in an HDFC Bank branch in Andheri, a month after Monica had moved the court seeking a de-freeze.

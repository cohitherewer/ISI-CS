	Lalgarh, Aug 02 (UNI) : Barely hours after Maoists gunned down a CPI(M) activist at Chirugora village under Belpahari police station, another CPI(M) leader was killed by the ultras at Amdanga under Lalgarh police station in West Midnapore district late last night.              
	Superintendent of Police, West Midnapore, MK Verma, confirming the incident, said four Maoists knocked on the door of Nirmal Mahato (48) at around 0030 hours last night. As soon as he opened the door, five rounds of bullets were pumped into his body, killing him on the spot.              
	Anil Mahato, brother of PCPA leader Chatradhar Mahato, along with five school students were arrested in this connection, the SP informed.              
	Hundreds of PCPA workers, demanding the release of the arrested leader and the students, have gone on a sit-in strike in front of the Lalgarh police station. They have also blocked the main road between Lalgarh and Ramgarh placing huge boulders.              
	Meanwhile, the road stretch between Chilgora and Sirshi was dug up by the PCPA, not allowing any police movement from Midnapore district headquarters towards Lalgarh.              
	Earlier, a group of 30 Maoists, in two action squads, came out of Khankrajhore forest at about 2130 hours last night and gunned down CPI(M) activist Kalipada Singh (40) at Chirugora village under Belpahari police station. Singh was an influential member of the Ganatantrik Pratirodh Committee set up by the party to tackle the Maoist influence in the area.

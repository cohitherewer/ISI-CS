	Pittsburgh, Sept. 25: After tip-toeing on the fringes of big power status for almost a decade, India was last night formally inducted into a seat at the global high table when the White House announced that the Group of 20 (G20) will replace the Group of Eight (G8) as the premier forum for international economic cooperation.        
	A White House statement late last night said an agreement tantamount to burying the G8 had been endorsed by world leaders gathered in Pittsburgh to reform global economic institutions to meet the needs of an interconnected global economy.        
	Within hours of the White House announcement, prime minister Manmohan Singh outlined the rationale for the decision acknowledging a new status in the international economic order for India and some other emerging economies.        
	India too has been affected by the economic crisis, Singh said at the plenary session of the G20 today, but, in common with other Asian countries, we have weathered the crisis relatively well given the circumstances.        
	The Prime Minister told his fellow global leaders here that after growing at nine per cent a year for four years, our economy slowed down to 6.7 per cent in 2008-09.        
	Explaining what he called a relatively strong performance, Singh said that despite a drought, which will affect agricultural production, we expect to grow by around 6.3 per cent in 2009-10 and then recover to seven to 7.5 per cent growth next year.        
	Arguing strongly for a redistribution of economic power in the world order, Singh pointed out that developing countries were in no way responsible for the (current global economic) crisis, but in many ways, they are the hardest hit.        
	Their GDP had grown at an annual average of 6.5 per cent for seven years, but this year such growth had fallen to 1.5 per cent, implying a fall in real per capita income.                  
	The White House announcement replacing G-8 by G20, belatedly acknowledged that dramatic changes in the world economy have not always been reflected in the global architecture for economic cooperation. This all started to change today.        
	The statement described the change as historic, pointing out that in addition to industrialised countries that formed G8  originally as G6 in 1975  India, China, Brazil and other similarly emerging G-20 economies will now be at the centre of efforts to work together to build a durable recovery while avoiding the financial fragilities that led to the (current global economic) crisis.        
	The Obama administration said this decision brings to the table the countries needed to build a stronger, more balanced global economy, reform the financial system, and lift the lives of the poorest.        
	The White House announcement made it clear that US president Barack Obama, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and other Western leaders had not come to the decision in any hurry. Nearly a decade ago, India was first invited to the fringes of a G8 summit.        
	In April, at the London summit of G20 leaders, it was decided to expand the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to include India and other G-20 partners in an effort to develop and implement sweeping reforms to transform the system of global regulation.The FSB is the successor to the Financial Stability Forum, created in 1999 by what was then the Group of Seven Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors.        
	It was also decided this year to add all the G20 members to the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information, which serves as the primary vehicle in the world economy to promote greater tax transparency.        
	Last nights announcement was a logical progression to this process.        
	Although world leaders meeting here may have acknowledged the need to include emerging economies in the process of global financial decision-making, it is unlikely that they will immediately wind up G8 altogether.        
	Howsoever anachronistic the G8 may have become in the light of changing realities of the world order, the rich countries will not easily give up their cosy club, which is also often used to keep in line India and others on strategic issues like non-proliferation and disarmament.        
	The dominant view here is that industrialised states have merely made a tactical concession to emerging economies in view of their need to seek the support of China, India and Brazil in order to tackle pressing issues thrown up by the present global financial crisis.        
	Alert to this possibility, the prime minister called today for following up decisions made in Pittsburgh by doubling the capital of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) so that it can lend more to middle-income and creditworthy poorer countries.

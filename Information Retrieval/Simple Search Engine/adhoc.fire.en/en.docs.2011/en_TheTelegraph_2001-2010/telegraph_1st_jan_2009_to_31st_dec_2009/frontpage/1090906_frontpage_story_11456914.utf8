The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Plan to recapture romance of science

          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                           
	New Delhi, Sept. 5: The countrys brightest students  and their parents  scouting for a research-based undergraduate course grounded on classical sciences may soon have an option before them.        
	The Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore is planning to start elite undergraduate programmes for the first time in its 100-year history, reinventing itself to face challenges to its pre-eminent position among the science research institutions in the country.         
	The IISc is planning to introduce a unique four-year, research-based undergraduate programme, including interaction between the students and its researchers, to lure  and retain  the best young brains into path-breaking science and engineering.         
	We will face some birth pangs. But I believe we will survive, Professor S.K. Biswas, the dean of the IISc and head of the team that drafted the course, told The Telegraph.         
	The course, drafted by a team picked by institute director P. Balaram, is likely to be finalised later this month after which the plan may be formally unveiled.         
	The draft course prepared by the institute received the stamp of approval from the faculty at a meeting on September 2. The faculty had rejected an earlier draft.         
	The move comes at a time when the institute, celebrating 100 years of its existence  created as a result of Jamshedji Tatas vision in 1909  faces unprecedented churning over its future course, institute sources said.         
	All major research universities in the West  such as Harvard, California Institute of Technology or the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  have strong undergraduate programmes linked with opportunities in cutting-edge research.         
	Wherever research has flourished, it has been backed by great undergraduate programmes, Biswas said.         
	The Prime Minister, senior government officials and top scientists have in recent years frequently expressed concerns that India is lagging behind China and other developing nations in both output and quality of research.         
	The IISc, institute officials said, wants a greater role in reshaping the nations higher education system, often criticised for its disconnect between undergraduate studies on the one hand and postgraduate and research programmes on the other.         
	This disconnect is often blamed for the low retention rate in postgraduate sciences and engineering, of students who complete undergraduate studies even at apex institutes like the IITs or top university colleges.         
	The initiative comes at a time some parents and students are doubting the merits of celebrated but highly competitive professional courses  like at the IIMs  which guaranteed substantial financial rewards till recently. The economic downturn and the inability of some young professionals to cope with the grim outcomes have stoked interest in higher education viewed as more fulfilling.         
	The injection of young talent into the IISc will alter the character of the institute and offer fresh challenges to the faculty. This move is a part of a larger plan for the growth of the IISc over the next 100 years, Biswas said.         
	The institute is hoping the undergraduate programme emerges a model for other institutions involved in higher education and research to follow. It will be titled a bachelors in science (BS) programme in a specialisation of the students choice  for instance in physics, chemistry or biology.         
	But good undergraduate programmes invariably also help create a larger public profile  like with the IITs  and funding from the government and industry, which Institute sources admitted were key motives behind the move.         
	The move also comes at a time when sections of the faculty at the IISc are warning that the gap in research productivity between Institute and the IITs is narrowing.         
	IISc sources were tight-lipped about the selection process they plan to use to pick students for the course, but said it would be restricted to around 500 of the brightest students interested over the first five years.         
	If there is a strong public demand for expansion, we can always increase the intake subsequently, a source said.         
	The undergraduate course structure drafted by the institute will in the first three years -- over six semesters -- aim at strengthening basic knowledge of classical scientific, mathematical and engineering subjects in students.         
	Students will have to study humanities -- they can pick from courses in areas of history, philosophy, sociology and the management of science and technology.         
	After the first three semesters, students will have to pick a stream of their choice -- a subject within the sciences and engineering that they wish to pursue in greater detail than other subjects.         
	While majoring in their chosen stream, students continue to study a certain minimum number of courses in other streams -- to keep the course inter-disciplinary.         
	The final year of the course will largely be devoted to a research project each student must undertake.

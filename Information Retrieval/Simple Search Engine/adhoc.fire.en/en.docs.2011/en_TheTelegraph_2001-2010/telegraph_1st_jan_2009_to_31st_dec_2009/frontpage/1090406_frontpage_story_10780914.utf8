	London, April 5: Shilpa Shetty now has almost 150 pairs of shoes, earned around 2 million last year, bought nearly 300 acres of agricultural land near Mumbai plus a place by the beach and was paid 500,000 for appearing on Celebrity Big Brother and just being myself for three weeks.        
	Shilpas economic well-being has been recorded in an interview published in London a day after Jade Goodys funeral.        
	Winning the reality television show led to so many other things, she explains in the money and investment section of The Sunday Times, London.         
	I was paid. After I came out, there were a lot of TV deals and a lot of exclusives with magazines.        
	She is part owner of the family apartment in Mumbai. She has also taken a share in the 3.2million house in Surrey which her boyfriend Raj Kundra used as his marital home when he was married to his first wife, Kavita, and which Shilpa now shares with him when she is in the UK.        
	As a long-term investment, Ive also just invested in a cricket team (the victorious Rajasthan Royals) with Raj, says Shilpa.        
	Last years earnings came mainly from TV work, films, endorsements and appearances. The biggest chunk was probably for hosting the Indian version of Big Brother last year. Its called Big Boss, and I got paid about 1million. I did it for three months. Not bad, given it was really just 16 days work.        
	As to whether she is generous, readers will have to make up their own minds. She says she carries very little money, admitting that actually, when Im in Mumbai, I even borrow money from my driver if I need to.        
	She observes: People definitely respect you  sadly so  when you have money.        
	While Shilpa seeks to continue bathing in the glory of winning Celebrity Big Brother, another Bollywood personality, Anil Kapoor, is enjoying being the focus of attention for his role in the hugely successful Slumdog Millionaire  the film is out on DVD next month.         
	While Shilpa has discussed just how rich she has become, Kapoor has spoken about what he does when he comes to London with the Evening Standard  the city is almost like a second home to many Bollywood actors.        
	I have an apartment in Mayfair, says Kapoor, whose residence located in one of the most expensive parts of London is close to the shops the actor loves in Bond Street.        
	As a designer, he is partial to Paul Smith because I love his. Ive lost count of how many I have.        
	He buys most of my clothes from Armani on Bond Street, likes to hang out at the bar of Dorchester Hotel after dark but does not get too much time to read books  at the moment, Im only reading scripts.        
	When travelling, Kapoor always packs a pair of his black Armani canvas and leather-shoe boots. Ive worn them so much that they are falling apart and look horrible but they are still my favourites.        
	Shilpa, however, is honest enough to confess that she likes to shop (possibly till Raj drops?) for clothes, bags and the shoes. Sometimes, I think I just splurge and splurge and splurge on rubbish.        
	And her big weakness? She laughs: Shoes. Shoes. Its horrible. I probably have nearly 150 pairs.         
	Imelda Marcos can relax, though the former Filipino First Ladys world record of possessing 1,060 pairs is not threatened.        
	All in all, it would seem that Shilpa, rather than Shah Rukh Khan, would make a better ambassador for ICICI because she emphasises the wisdom of saving: Im a self-confessed shopaholic although I also save. I live with the philosophy that I save at least 40 per cent of what I earn and spend 60 per cent. My father would disagree with me. His philosophy is that you save 70 per cent and spend only 30 per cent.

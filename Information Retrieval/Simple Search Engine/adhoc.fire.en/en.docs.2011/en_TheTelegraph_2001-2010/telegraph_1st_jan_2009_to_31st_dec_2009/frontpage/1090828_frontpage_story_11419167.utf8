          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Agartala, Aug. 27: The Centre has decided to extend 27 per cent reservation for admission of students belonging to Other Backward Classes to the National Institute of Technology here from the current academic session according to the national formula.        
	Official sources in the department of higher education today said the Union council of ministers had taken a final decision in this regard at a meeting this morning, refusing to take into consideration the location of the institute within the Autonomous District Council area.         
	We have received an official communication in this regard from Union ministry of human resource development and the reservation formula is all set to be implemented from the current academic session, a source said.         
	The official communication from the Union HRD ministry read: The Union cabinet today approved the implementation of reservation for students belonging to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes to NIT Agartala in Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council.         
	Minister for higher education Anil Sarkar expressed satisfaction and happiness over the issue and said the Union cabinets approval would fulfil the legitimate aspirations of the depressed sections of people for higher education.         
	The leaders of OBC organisations have also expressed satisfaction over the Union cabinets decision.         
	The tangle over reservation at the NIT here had arisen initially over the Tripura governments insistence on having the state formula for reservation  31 per cent for Scheduled Tribes, 17 per cent for Scheduled Castes  implemented in the institute.

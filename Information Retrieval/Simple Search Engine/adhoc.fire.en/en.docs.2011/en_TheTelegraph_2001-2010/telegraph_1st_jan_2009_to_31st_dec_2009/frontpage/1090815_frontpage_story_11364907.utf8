          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 14: The government that Mamata Banerjee fought against successfully to stop land acquisition will take over farming plots for her railway ministry.        
	The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government has decided to take over 320 acres of farmland and hand them over to the railway ministry for laying tracks in North and South 24-Parganas, Bankura, Burdwan, Murshidabad and Cooch Behar.        
	Mamatas Trinamul Congress, which scored unprecedented electoral success by opposing every project where farmland acquisition is involved, is calling this move justified since it is for the greater good of the people.        
	Land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah said today that administrative approval to acquire the land was given between May 16 and August 13. Its true that agricultural land will have to be acquired and given to the railway ministry. But the fact is that the projects will benefit our state, he said.        
	That is the argument the Left Front government had offered while taking over farmland for the Tata car project in Singur. The law under which the acquisition was done provides for government takeover in the public interest.        
	Trinamul resisted, succeeding in driving out the Nano project. It was not just Singur and Nandigram that Mamata fought against. Her party has opposed land acquisition for a power project, national highway and power transmission poles.        
	A CPM state committee member said: The Trinamul chief has emerged successful in her political battle with her land movement ever since the Singur controversy erupted. Now she is the one who is taking agricultural land without even thinking of them (farmers), but we know land is needed for railway lines.        
	Trinamul leader Partha Chatterjee argued that the railway projects had been conceived during the previous governments tenure. Land to be acquired here will be narrow stretches and displacement wouldnt be much. Besides, the land is being acquired for the greater good of the people, he added.        
	It has to be assumed then that Trinamul does not consider acquiring land for electricity transmission poles in Rajarhat, which it has opposed, an exercise for the greater good of the people.        
	Neither would land for widening of National Highway 34 in North 24-Parganas qualify. Nor for constructing a public sector power plant at Katwa in Burdwan.        
	Pranab Mukherjee, the Congress leader who is now Mamatas poll ally, had shown the foresight of an experienced politician when he had criticised the Trinamul leader during her land agitation.         
	He had said: Those opposing projects meant for a public purpose will find after coming to power that it had been suicidal on their part to do so.

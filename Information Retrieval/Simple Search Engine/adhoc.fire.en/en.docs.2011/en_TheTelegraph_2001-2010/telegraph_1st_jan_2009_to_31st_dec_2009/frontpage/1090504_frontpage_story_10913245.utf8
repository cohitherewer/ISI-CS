	Kathmandu, May 3: The fragile peace process in Nepal appeared to be on the verge of a collapse after the ruling Maoists ignored pressure from the international community led by India and unilaterally sacked army chief Rukmagat Katuwal today.         
	As tens of thousands of people poured into the streets of Kathmandu to demonstrate both for and against the decision by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal alias Prachanda, the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist-Leninist), the second biggest constituent of the seven-party alliance, withdrew support to the Maoists.         
	Another dramatic element was added late tonight with unconfirmed reports suggesting that the President, who belongs to the Opposition Nepali Congress party, has asked Katuwal to continue as army chief, pending orders.        
	In a note to the general, President Ram Baran Yadav is learnt to have authorised the army chief to take appropriate action if anybody obstructed him from performing his duties. However, both the presidential office and the army refused to confirm if such a note had been sent.        
	The reports on the note emerged after Katuwal, who initially refused to accept the dismissal order, appeared to indicate that he would hand over charge and approach the Supreme Court tomorrow.        
	Tensions have been rising for months as the ruling Maoists have struggled with the army over its refusal to integrate former rebel units, now housed in UN-monitored camps, into its ranks.         
	Prachanda wanted the Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) freed and admitted to the national army but Katuwal resisted the move and clashed repeatedly with the government over the issue. The government says Katuwal also ignored orders to stop recruiting soldiers, boycotted last months national games, and allowed eight generals to continue working past their tenure.        
	Sources said the PLA has been put on high alert this evening.        
	It is not clear whether the government headed by the Maoists, who have 238 members in the 601-member parliament, still enjoys a majority after the pullout by the 108-member Communist Party. The Communist Party has traditionally been part of the political mainstream, while the Maoists until 2006 were a rebel group fighting government troops.         
	Prime Minister Prachanda bulldozed the army chiefs sack order through the cabinet even as ministers belonging to four major coalition partners walked out in protest.         
	Sources in the army told The Telegraph that Katuwal was closeted with his lawyers. The legality of the order is being examined as four major constituents of the ruling coalition are not party to it, a source said.         
	It was unclear if Prachanda had the legal power to remove the army chief. Nepals Constitution is currently being rewritten, but the army is officially under the command of the President, not the Prime Minister.         
	The Maoists are trying to keep the government afloat. A senior Maoist leader said the Madhesi Janadhikar Forum, which has 52 members, might still opt to stay back in the coalition.         
	Sources said the Indian government was concerned that the Maoists refused to heed Delhis advice to be guided by consensus on the army chief. India is looking at sending an emissary if the situation so demands, the sources added.

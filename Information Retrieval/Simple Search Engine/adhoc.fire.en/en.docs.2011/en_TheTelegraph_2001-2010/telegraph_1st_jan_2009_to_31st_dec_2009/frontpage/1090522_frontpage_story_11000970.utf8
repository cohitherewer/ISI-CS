                                                                                                           BJD boss takes charge 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, May 21: BJD chief Naveen Patnaik today took charge as the chief minister for the third consecutive term, setting a record in Orissas political history.         
	Earlier veteran Congress leader J.B. Patnaik had served the state as chief minister for three terms spanning over 14 years, but his stint was not uninterrupted. However, Naveen, who occupied the office of chief minister in 2000, has been at the helm without a break.         
	Naveen drove to the state secretariat and attended to official business after Governor M.C. Bhandare administered the oath of office and secrecy to him and 20 other ministers at a special function held at Raj Bhavan.         
	For the first time, BJD has came to power on its own by securing an absolute majority, winning as many as 103 seats in the 147-member state Assembly. In 2000 and 2004, a BJD-BJP coalition had formed the government.         
	Naveen, who had entered politics reluctantly in 1997 following the death of his father Biju Patnaik, was elected to the Lok Sabha twice (1998 and 1999) and had become a cabinet minister in the NDA government at the Centre.         
	However, he switched to state politics in 2000 and led the BJD-BJP alliance to power twice (2000 and 2004).         
	The 62-year-old politician played a master-stroke this year by snapping ties with its 11-year-old ally, the BJP, and secured a landslide victory in the just-concluded elections.         
	Today, he formed his own government, which was a blend of experience and young blood.         
	Nine cabinet ministers (Prafulla Chandra Ghadei, Damodar Rout, Ananga Udaya Singhdeo, Surya Narayan Patro, Raghunath Mohanty, Prasanna Acharya, Pramila Mallick, Prafulla Samal and Debi Prasad Mishra) and minister of state (Sanjib Sahoo) were experienced hands; the remaining were new faces.         
	While Ghadei, Singhdeo, Patro, Mohanty, Mallick, Prafulla Samal, Mishra and Sahoo  all were ministers in the outgoing cabinet  have been retained, former ministers Rout, Acharya and Samal were re-inducted by Naveen in his new ministry.         
	Rout was panchayati raj minister in his government for years before he was dropped. Acharya and Samal were ministers in the Biju Patnaik government in the early nineties.         
	On the other hand, Bikram Keshari Arukh and Bijoy Ranjan Singh Bariha (cabinet) and Sarada Prasad Nayak, Pushpendra Singhdeo, Ramesh Majhi, Pratap Jena, Prabin Chandra Bhanjadeo, Atanu Sabyasachi, Badrinarayan Patra and Anjali Behera (minister of state) were first-time ministers.         
	Arukh, elected to the Assembly for the fourth consecutive term, won the 2009 elections by a record margin of over 73,000 votes.         
	He had earlier served as chief whip of the ruling BJD-BJP.         
	Bariha  an ex-student of JNU  has been elected to the Assembly four times and this time defeated Opposition chief whip Satya Bhusan Sahu.        
	Ministers of state  Nayak, Singhdeo, Majhi, Jena, Sabyasachi, Patra and Behera  have the experience of MLA for two terms and more. However, Bhanjadeo, a scion of the erstwhile Mayurbhanj royal family and elected from the Morada constituency, is a first-timer in the Assembly.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Rahul works to a plan to look for new allies
                                                                                                           Rahul works to a plan to look for new allies

	New Delhi, May 6: Rahul Gandhis praise of Nitish Kumar and Chandrababu Naidu was not off the cuff but part of a four-month-old process designed to hunt for new allies, Congress sources said today.        
	The young MP is working on wooing new friends to form a government if the Congress emerges as the single largest party but, the sources added, this does not mean existing partners like Mamata Banerjee will be dumped.        
	We will not take even a single step forward to subvert the agreement with the Trinamul Congress, spokesperson M. Veerappa Moily said, a day after Rahul told reporters he was confident of Left support.        
	The sources said Rahuls associates have been in touch with those close to Nitish, Naidu and some other NDA and third front constituents.         
	A former bureaucrat who is now a Rajya Sabha MP is said to be playing a pivotal role in bringing the Congress and the Janata Dal (United) close.        
	Rahul, who has emerged as the Congresss key strategist, is at the same time working on a back-up plan that will come into play if the party fails to get the numbers to form the government.         
	Plan B revolves around the AICC general secretarys vision of ekla chalo and revival of the party in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, other Hindi heartland states and Bengal.         
	Rahul got in touch with party leaders today to explain that his remarks about finding new allies and counting on the Lefts support did not imply betraying existing allies.         
	Accordingly, Mamata has been told the leadership values the alliance and she is a precious ally. ( )        
	Another general secretary, Ghulam Nabi Azad, said the party was not considering changing allies in Tamil Nadu. Speculation that the DMK would be dumped for the ADMK post-poll gained momentum when Sonia Gandhi today called off her tour of the state.        
	Sources said Sonia cancelled the trip because she would not be able to meet DMK chief M. Karunanidhi. The two were to share the platform at a rally, but Karunanidhi is in hospital. The Special Protection Group overruled Sonias wish to visit him.         
	Referring to Rahuls comments yesterday, Congress leaders said the Amethi MP waited for polling to end in Andhra Pradesh and the bulk of seats in Bihar before making the overtures in public.         
	The sources said the unilateral decision by Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan to leave only a few seats to the Congress forced the partys hand. The party is also eyeing the ADMK and the BJD but will wait for the results.        
	Congress leaders said the party would try to reach the majority mark of 272 without the Left parties but, if it could not, would attempt to accommodate their concerns in the common minimum programme without compromising on the Prime Minister or the nuclear deal.

                                                                                                           Soren to resign today with Champai rider
          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                              
	Ranchi, Jan. 11: Bowing to pressure from alliance partners, chief minister Shibu Soren announced that he would tender his resignation at 11am tomorrow.        
	Soren said that he expected the UPA to accept Champai Soren as his successor.        
	Sorens resignation letter is ready, but before handing it over to Governor Syed Sibtey Razi, he is leaving no stone unturned to prove his point. He expects the UPA high command to honour his partys decision to make Champai the next chief minister or go for fresh Assembly elections in the existing set-up.        
	Soren said he would even prefer martyrdom, if the Centre imposed Presidents rule in a day or two and he is determined to fight till the end to somehow retain the chief ministers chair as long as possible  be it a new government under Champais leadership or his own caretaker government till the next Assembly elections.        
	My resignation letter is ready. I will go to the Raj Bhavan at 11am tomorrow. I am only waiting for Delhis reply on our partys decision to make Champai the next chief minister, Soren told reporters today.        
	In fact, warnings by his own alliance members greeted Soren on his 65th birthday today. While the rival NDA staged silent protests at the Albert Ekka Chowk demanding his resignation, the Independents gave him one-hour ultimatum to step down. Soren also seems to have been sidelined by JMM members in the holy mission. A majority of JMM legislators are not willing to accept Champais leadership. The UPA meeting called by the chief minister to discuss the new challenges ahead too evoked a lukewarm response with only seven JMM MLAs attending it, that too omore than an hour late.The Congress members too stayed away from the meeting.         
	Union minister of state for home Sri Prakash Jaiswal, who was here to attend a programme, said that the Congress had already cleared its stand that Soren should submit his resignation. The Congress will take all steps which will be constitutional and in the interest of the state, Jaiswal, who also met Razi, said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Wal-Mart tiptoes in, smoothly
                                                                                                           Wal-Mart tiptoes in, smoothly

	Amritsar, May 30: Wal-Mart has made a smooth entry in India, with its first wholesale store opening in Amritsar today without any of the hiccups that delayed the take-off of Metro Cash and Carry in Calcutta.        
	We intend to open between 10 and 15 such stores in Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and Madhya Pradesh in the next three years, said Rajan Bharti Mittal of Bharti Enterprises, which set up a joint venture with Wal-Mart to open the stores under the name Best Price Modern Wholesale.        
	The joint venture was signed in August 2007. Construction of the store started about a year later.        
	The process to get the necessary permissions from the state government was smooth, said Aarti Singh, vice-president, communications, Bharti Wal-Mart.         
	In Bengal, Metro had decided to start work in 2005 and was issued a licence. But it ran into a land dispute over the EM Bypass plot in 2006. Before the dispute could be resolved in October 2007, Metros licence was cancelled in June 2007. The Forward Bloc, a partner in the Left Front, set itself against granting permission to Metro and at one point the wholesaler threatened to scrap its plans to open the store here. Finally, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee intervened and the licence was issued in October 2008. The store opened in December.        
	In Punjab, the ruling Shiromani Akali Dal-BJP coalition put no roadblocks in the path of Bharti Wal-Mart. Nor were there any protests by farmers or general store owners, who might have feared their business being hit.         
	Chief minister Parkash Singh Badal was to have opened the 50,000sqft store on May 26  something Bhattacharjee could never have dreamt of, given the opposition in his government  but the violence in Punjab over the Vienna gurdwara attack scuttled that plan.        
	Initially, time was spent on educating local farmers and manufacturers on the cost effectiveness of tying up with us.... Then we had to look at a suitable spot, a senior company official said.        
	Some retailers could be seen today asking about products on offer  around 6,000 food and non-food items.         
	I have come here to first compare the prices of various commodities with what I have been getting from other wholesalers. If I find them lower I will become a member, said Darshan Singh, a retailer in Amritsar. The store can only sell to licensed members.        
	Rajan Bharti Mittal, the vice-chairman and managing director of Bharti, said: The experience we have had in Punjab has made us aware that such stores are needed in the country....        
	The store will cater to hotels, restaurants, caterers and retail stores. We will also be catering to the army, he said.        
	Mittal said Bharti would consider a joint venture with Wal-Mart for multi-brand retailing if the Indian government allows foreign direct investment in the segment. At present, foreign multiple-brand retailers are not allowed to sell directly to consumers.        
	We have major expectation from the government to open up the multi-brand retail sector as there is only 5 per cent organised retail in India at the moment, Mittal said.        
	The CPM, which had a big say in the last UPA government but has lost that voice now, said it remained opposed to allowing multi-nationals in retail. We are opposing this move consistently. This is something that adversely affects traders and consumers equally, politburo member S. Ramachandaran Pillai said.         
	He recalled that the CPM politburo had opposed the deal between Wal-Mart and Bharti, which is in effect a backdoor entry of FDI in retail trade, through a statement on November 28, 2006, as well.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Bhattacharjee                                  
	Calcutta, Dec. 1: In deciding to free Presidency College from state control, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has finally defied his own party.        
	The chief minister and the CPM had diametrically opposite views on the issue. While he had long favoured the idea of granting autonomy to Presidency College, or otherwise making it an independent institution, the party would not allow any such thing to happen.        
	Not letting Presidency College to go out of the states  and the partys  control fitted the CPMs scheme of things for education in Bengal. The party not only wanted to control education in the name of democratising it, but also wanted that control to keep elitists out and give education over to the mediocre.        
	The chief minister, himself an alumnus of the college, opposed this policy. He agreed with the general criticism that the deterioration of the academic standards in the college was entirely because of his partys policies.        
	He would even remark in close circles that leaders of the college employees union, affiliated to his party, were really the men who controlled matters, including transfer of lecturers.        
	The departure of Anil Biswas, former CPM secretary who died shortly before the 2006 Assembly polls, strengthened the chief ministers resolve to settle the Presidency College issue. On the eve of these polls, he would talk of granting autonomy to Presidency College along with several other colleges. Biswas, who was also convener of the Left Fronts education cell, saw control over Presidency, as other things in education, only in terms of opportunities to put party loyalists in key positions. The question of academic purity or excellence was, to him, an elitist concept.        
	In the current political scenario that holds the prospect of the CPM losing power in 2011, Bhattacharjee had another reason for finally taking the decision on Presidency College. Given Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjees criticism that the CPM has ruined the college and also the possibility that she might give it autonomy if she comes to power, the chief minister was apparently keen to pre-empt her.         
	He agreed that the Presidency College issue has an emotive appeal to the Bengali middle-class. So better do it now than leave it to be done by Mamata.        
	With Singur and Nandigram stillborn, Nayachar a distant dream and his hope of Bengals industrial revival in tatters, at least a new avatar of Presidency College could redeem some of Bhattacharjees lost image.        
	It has been suggested to the chief minister that granting Presidency College autonomy or making it a university is not going to make any difference unless he is bold enough to go for fundamental change.         
	He has been told, for instance, that he should think about bringing in Bengali academics of international standing who have been in institutions abroad to give Presidency College a completely new character and orientation. Such a move could immediately lift the college from petty politics and interference by the bureaucracy.        
	Bhattacharjee is said to have reacted to the idea favourably and is likely to discuss it with high-profile personalities like Amartya Sen.

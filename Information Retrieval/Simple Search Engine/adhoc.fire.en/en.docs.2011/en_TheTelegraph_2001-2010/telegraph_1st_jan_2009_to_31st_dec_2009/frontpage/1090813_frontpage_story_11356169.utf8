The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | CPM set to invite Mamata 
                                                                                                           CPM set to invite Mamata 
  - Opposition leaders on list for Subhas condolence meet           BISWAJIT ROY                            Subhas with Mamata during a railway event in 2000                                        
	Calcutta, Aug. 12: The CPM will invite Mamata Banerjee to a rally on Friday to condole the death of Subhas Chakraborty, overcoming initial reservations and embracing the expired leaders non-partisan approach the party did not always endorse when he was alive.        
	A CPM leader said the invitation to Mamata  through a letter scheduled to be delivered tonight  was in tune with the partys tradition, but he was not sure if a similar gesture was made when state secretary Anil Biswas died in 2006.        
	Among other Opposition leaders to be invited to Fridays remembrance at Netaji Indoor Stadium are former Congress chief minister S.S. Ray and Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee.        
	The political leaders, including Mamata who had paid her respects to Subhasda, either at the CPM state headquarters, the Assembly or elsewhere, would be invited personally, said party leader Rabin Deb, one of the key organisers of the rally on behalf of the CPM state committee.         
	Mamata had paid her respects at the central Calcutta mortuary from where Chakrabortys last journey began on August 4, a day after the former sports and youth affairs minister died.        
	Former Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, who had received Chakrabortys unstinted support after his expulsion from the CPM, will also be among the invitees. Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi, who has been repeatedly criticised by the Left, will not be invited. The governor had sent a wreath after Chakrabortys death as he was out of station on that day, Raj Bhavan sources said.         
	Actor Mithun Chakraborty and cricketer Sourav Ganguly will also be among the invitees to the programme that the CPM wants to make a huge success.        
	In contrast, the Indoor stadium rally to pay homage to Biswas, the then CPM state secretary and politburo member, in 2006 was purely an affair of the party and the Left Front. Mamata had then visited the city nursing home where Biswas died.        
	Unlike Biswas, Chakraborty had a good rapport with sister Mamata, particularly when rumours were rife that he was tinkering with the idea of leaving the CPM before the 2001 Assembly polls.         
	According to the party sources, the CPM leadership initially had reservations about inviting Mamata, the partys arch enemy, and Ray, who the party had always described as the architect of semi-Fascist terror in Bengal in the early seventies.         
	It was decided that political invitees would be restricted to those who had visited the partys Alimuddin Street headquarters where Chakrabortys body was kept for public homage. However, the decision was changed later in view of Chakrabortys popularity across the political divide  a factor underscored by the huge turnout at his last journey.         
	Another factor at play was an assumption that non-partisan invitations might help the CPM somewhat blunt an expected Opposition effort to project Chakraborty as a tragic hero wronged by his own party.        
	 If Mamata turns up at Netaji Indoor, it will be her first meeting with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee since their failed discussions at the peak of the Singur controversy. But both CPM and Trinamul leaders said that it was unlikely that Mamata would share the platform with him and CPM state secretary Biman Bose.        
	 If we had not invited her, we would have been accused of lacking civility. Now its up to her whether she would like to reciprocate our gesture, said a CPM leader.        
	The Opposition leader in the Assembly, Partha Chattarjee, who had also paid respects to Chakraborty and will be invited to the condolence meeting, was evasive. So far, Mamata and me have received invitations from Subhasdas wife Ramala and his extended family to attend the family function on August 16. If I had no other major preoccupation, I would try to attend it, Chatterjee said.         
	But we have not received any invitation for the August 14 rally so far. Neither do I know whether its a state government programme or a CPM function. I cant say whether we will join it before we get the invitation. We are not interested in politics over Subhasdas death, he added.        
	But the CPM leadership seems to be keen on making a post-poll turnaround by tapping popular admiration and empathy for Chakraborty without revaluating his politics that had often challenged the party brass.        
	It is not clear whether CPM general secretary Prakash Karat would attend the Indoor rally or not. But politburo member Sitaram Yechury in a signed article in the party mouthpiece, Peoples Democracy, has eulogised Comrade Subhas as truly a mass leader.         
	Highlighting Chakrabortys uncanny ability to cut across the political spectrum and reach out to a large canvas of public opinion and to the common people, Yechury cited the spontaneous human outpouring at his last journey.        
	He made apparent the leaderships efforts at a post-poll resurrection with the help of Chakrabortys memory. Hundreds on the way would come up to assure that they are with us and urging the leadership to steadfastly march forward, overcoming weaknesses and by rectifying and correcting mistakes, Yechury wrote.         
	 The partys North 24-Parganas unit, Chakrabortys home district, has decided to hold a separate condolence meeting on August 23 at Salt Lake Stadium. The partys labour arm, Citu, will organise its remembrance on August 16 at the Calcutta University centenary hall. More such rallies will be held, along with publication of booklets on Chakraborty and a photo exhibition on his life.

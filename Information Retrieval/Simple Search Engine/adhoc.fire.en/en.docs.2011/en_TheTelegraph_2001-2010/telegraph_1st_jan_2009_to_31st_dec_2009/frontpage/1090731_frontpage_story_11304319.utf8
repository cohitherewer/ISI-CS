The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Lid off substandard medicine   Malaria, TB, typhoid pills fail test despite panel alert

          G.S. MUDUR                                                     
	New Delhi, July 30: Patients in India continue to be exposed to substandard medicines six years after a government panel had examined the problem and recommended rapid corrective action, a study has revealed.         
	The study by an international research team has found that several samples of medicines used in the treatment of malaria, tuberculosis and other infections failed tests to assess pharmacologically active ingredients of the drugs.         
	Immunologist Amir Attaran at the University of Ottawa, Canada, collaborated with economists and other researchers in India, the US and the UK to analyse 281 drug samples from Delhi and 260 samples from Chennai picked up in July 2008 and March 2009.        
	Overall, 12 per cent of the samples from Delhi and 5 per cent of the samples from Chennai failed one or both of two tests. Despite its small sample size, Attaran said, the study provides a snapshot of reality with serious implications for health. Even a 2 per cent failure rate might mean thousands of patients in India might be buying drugs unlikely to work, he said.         
	They have reported their findings in the journal Public Library of Science One. Substandard drugs have lower concentrations of pharmacological ingredients than what they should actually contain.         
	The results show that little has changed since 2003 when a 10-member panel led by the then head of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, R. Mashelkar, had documented that substandard drugs in India made up 8 per cent to 10 per cent of the domestic pharmaceutical market. The panel had suggested corrective steps to be implemented by 2006.        
	Attaran and his colleagues found failure rates ranging from 2 per cent to 17 per cent (see chart). We used crude tests  the quickest and least expensive  to catch the most obvious problems. Samples that fail these tests should not be used as medicines, Attaran told The Telegraph.         
	All samples from five of 26 chemists shops in Delhi and 16 out 26 shops in Chennai passed tests, but samples from 10 shops in Delhi and 8 in Chennai had 6 per cent to 10 per cent failure rates. Samples from three shops in Delhi had 20 per cent to 30 per cent failure rates.         
	This non-uniform failure patterns across chemists shops suggest that the problem of substandard drugs appears to be driven by a small subset of manufacturers or shops thriving in a poorly regulated environment, the researchers said.        
	A member of the panel that had been chaired by Mashelkar said that although the government had initiated action on the panels recommendations, the pace of the corrective steps have been disappointing.         
	The laws are still weak, there is little deterrence, and substandard and fake drugs still pose a serious problem in India, Vijay Karan, former Delhi police commissioner and panel member, said.        
	An official in the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation  the agency which regulates medicines in India  said inspections in various states suggested that about seven per cent of drugs in India might be substandard.        
	A drug industry analyst has questioned the new studys methodology, arguing that it has information gaps and appears intended to create a scare about drugs from India using a small sample size. But he conceded there were reasons for worry.         
	We dont know whether identical brands were picked up from the two cities (Delhi and Chennai) and how close they were to expiry dates, said Chandra Gulhati, editor of the Monthly Index of Medical Specialities, India, a journal of drugs.         
	But potential sources of problems are variations in manufacturing standards, and transportation and storage of medicines, Gulhati said. Some chemists shops might be switching off their refrigerators at night.

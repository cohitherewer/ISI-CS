The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Britneys Twitter account hacked
                                                                                                           Britneys Twitter account hacked
          NIGEL KENDALL                            Spears: Celebrity target                                  
	London, May 2: A hacker going by the name of Hacker Croll has apparently gained access to an administrator account at the micro-blogging service Twitter.         
	Posting on a French online discussion forum, Hacker Croll claimed to have hacked into the account of Jason Goldman, one of Twitters directors of product management. To back up the claims, he or she posted 13 screenshots of Twitters account management interface.         
	The screenshots suggest that the hacker was able to access the accounts of several celebrity Twitter users, including those of the singer Britney Spears and the actor Ashton Kutcher.        
	The company said no password information appears to have been changed, and no personal messages viewed.         
	This is the second time this year that Twitter has been hacked. It seems that Hacker Croll used the same method as the earlier hacker. He or she simply correctly guessed a password based on minimal information about the target.         
	On March 5 this year, Twitter admitted that 750 Twitter accounts had been broken into. At the time, Twitter issued this advice to its users: Keep in mind that strong passwords can help prevent hijacked accounts.                    THE TIMES, LONDON

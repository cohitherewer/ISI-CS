The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | BJP worry: Cong amp; regional parties
                                                                                                           BJP worry: Cong amp; regional parties
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                            Om Prakash Chautala and Raj Thackeray				                                 
	New Delhi, Oct. 23: Every poll defeat now echoes a warning to the BJP: if you cant reclaim the Opposition space, an Om Prakash Chautala or some other regional chieftain will.        
	And if that happens, be sure the RSS will back the Congress because the Sangh believes that sectarian regional outfits are not necessarily nationalistic.        
	That message from the Haryana elections hit the BJP hard today. Its real worry is not that it had misread the growing anti-Congress mood and blown up its chances to ally with the Indian National Lok Dal. The BJPs real fear is that if it sits idle, not only will the Congress benefit but even the Opposition space would go to a regional party.        
	Our claim to be the only alternative to the Congress will be lost, a functionary admitted.        
	The BJP can hardly hope to win an election on its own in Haryana, where it exists mainly in the cities and towns.        
	But the larger message is that if we dont get an image makeover  shed our urban, upper-caste, Brahmin-Bania image and penetrate the hinterland  we will forever have to ride piggyback on Chautala or Bhajan Lal, a source said.        
	What Maharashtra and Haryana have taught the BJP is that if it has to remain the leading non-Congress option, it should do what the Congress has done over the decades. That is, have a presence in every caste and community and in every geographical corner so that if it loses in one, it can try and make up in another.        
	In Maharashtra, the BJP doesnt quite know what to make of Raj Thackerays rise except to say that once Bal Thackeray leaves the scene, the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena looks likely to snatch his legacy from the Shiv Sena.        
	BJP leaders, who have seen how Raj dresses and speaks like the average Maharashtra youth, say that while Bal Thackerays son Uddhav comes across as rather nondescript and even laid-back, the nephew has showed he has fire in his belly and by implication, enormous potential.        
	The party is afraid that if it hangs on to the Sena, its ally of 20 years, it may end up as a dot on Maharashtras political map.        
	The BJPs immediate worry is Jharkhand. Sources are already comparing former chief minister Babulal Marandi, who has floated his own outfit after leaving the BJP, with Raj.        
	Jharkhands principal Opposition  the NDA combine of the BJP and the Janata Dal (United)  is theoretically best poised to defeat the Congress, sources say. But if its state leaders Arjun Munda and Yashwant Sinha continue to squabble, they add, the still nascent Rashtriya Janata Dal-Lok Janshakti Party-Left-Jharkhand Mukti Morcha-Marandi axis could grab the Opposition turf.        
	The BJP has noted how, in former bastion Delhi, it won one of the two recent bypolls while the other went to the RJD. It had to do with the candidate. But it reinforces our apprehensions that we cant always take advantage of an anti-Congress mood. There are other claimants, a source said.        
	The BJP knows that in Uttar Pradesh, it has already ceded to the Congress the status of the main national alternative to the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party.

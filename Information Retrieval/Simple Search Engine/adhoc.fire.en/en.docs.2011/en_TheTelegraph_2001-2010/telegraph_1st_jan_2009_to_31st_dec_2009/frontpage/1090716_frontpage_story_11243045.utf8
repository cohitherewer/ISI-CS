The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Assam lures capital with huge incentives 
                                                                                                           Assam lures capital with huge incentives 
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Guwahati, July 15: Assam today charted out a new roadmap in industrial development by offering a huge range of incentives and positioning itself as the most favourable destination for investment.         
	If we combine the incentives of the North East Industrial and Investment Promotion Policy (NEIIPP), 2007, and the incentives in the 2008 Assam Industrial Policy, Assam should be the most favourable destination in the country now as the incentives are huge, Assam industries and power minister Pradyut Bordoloi said during the release of the policy.         
	The 2008 Assam Industrial Policy will be effective retrospectively from October 1, 2008.         
	The new policy lays emphasis on new capital formation through the creation of ecologically compliant assets in a sustainable manner.         
	We want to build our economy on the core strengths of this region so that we can manage our resources. While doing so, we also identify the key issues the world is facing today as a result of the conflict between ecology and economics that caused an imbalance mainly on the stress on food, water, energy and the environment. The recognised core strengths of our state today are its nature, water, agriculture, human resources and geographical location, the policy states.         
	The minister said the policy should have been released earlier but several constraints stood in the way. We are creating an industry friendly environment, Bordoloi said, adding that the policy had several attractive features to attract investments.         
	He said a land bank of industrial infrastructure had also been brought out which would help investors learn of the available developed industrial land. The state now has 1,000 acres of developed industrial land.         
	The minister said the World Banks ranking of Guwahati as eighth in a list of 17 cities was also good news. We would not like to remain in the eighth spot. We would like to make it to the top.         
	He said a task force would be constituted to find out more ways to help Guwahati become more business friendly.        
	Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi said incentives alone were not enough, the creation of a market was very important.         
	Tatas and Birlas do not look for incentives but for market. If there is a market, they will come on their own, he said.         
	Gogoi said the emphasis should be on small industries as the state could develop only through these.         
	The recession did not affect the small-scale industries but impacted the big ones, he added.         
	Gogoi suggested the setting up of an investment council to identify sectors that could attract investment.

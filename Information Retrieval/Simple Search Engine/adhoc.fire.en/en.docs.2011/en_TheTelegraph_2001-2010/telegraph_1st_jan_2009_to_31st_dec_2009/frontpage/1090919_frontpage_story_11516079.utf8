The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Jammu firing sets off sneak-in alarm
                                                                                                           Jammu firing sets off sneak-in alarm
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             Security personnel carry out checks on the Jammu-Poonch highway on Friday after the firing in Akhnoor. (PTI)                                  
	Srinagar, Sept. 18: Jammu went on an infiltration alert today after two spells of cross-border firing, suspected to be a ploy to push in militants to foment trouble during the festival season.        
	Two jawans were injured in the firing that lasted around two hours yesterday evening along the international border, raising fears that some militants might have slipped into India.        
	But security forces said they had foiled the sneak-in attempt, said to be the third in the past five days.        
	Another round of firing occurred this morning but was said to be brief.        
	It wasnt clear if the infiltrators themselves or the Pakistan Rangers were behind the firing in Jammus Akhnoor sector. Such action by the latter would amount to a ceasefire violation, of which there have been several instances this year.        
	A BSF officer in Jammu said the Pakistan Rangers were trying to push in infiltrators to create trouble during Navratri and Id, adding that the firing couldnt have been possible without the information of the Rangers, Pakistans border guards.        
	A flag meeting between the BSF and the Pakistan Rangers was held later in the day in which we lodged a strong protest, a BSF officer said.        
	The firing came days after rockets were fired from across the border in Punjab.         
	In Delhi, BSF chief Raman Srivastava said: Intelligence inputs show there is an attempt to provide covering fire (to infiltrators).        
	He added that such infiltration attempts had been on the rise all along the border.        
	A.K. Sarolia, BSF inspector-general (Jammu frontier), however, said his troops had retaliated and pushed back the infiltrators. It was an infiltration bid and we foiled it.        
	Despite claims that the infiltration attempt had been thwarted, Jammu police were not taking any chances. They sealed entry and exit points and frisked pedestrians as part of a search for any militant who might have sneaked in.        
	Lt Gen. G.M. Nair, General Officer Commanding, 9 Corps, went on an aerial surveillance along the border in the area.        
	The infiltration alarm revived memories of August last year when three militants had sneaked into Jammu town  helped by cover fire by the Pakistan Rangers  and killed three residents before being shot down after a 19-hour hostage drama.        
	Although there was no confirmation that Pakistani soldiers were involved in the firing last evening and today, the suspicion was fuelled by recent violations of the ceasefire, in force since November 2003.         
	Of late, Pakistan has been violating the ceasefire, a defence spokesperson said. This year, official figures put the number of such violations at nine till June.

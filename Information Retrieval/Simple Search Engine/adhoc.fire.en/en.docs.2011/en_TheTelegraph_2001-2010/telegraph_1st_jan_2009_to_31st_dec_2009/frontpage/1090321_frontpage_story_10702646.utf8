The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Bengal raise rests on M-factor 
                                                                                                           Bengal raise rests on M-factor 
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, March 20: The Marxist-midwifed front or Manmohan Singh or the market.        
	On these three  not necessarily in that order  rests the Bengal governments intention to pay higher salaries to its employees.        
	The state government will have to make provisions for paying Rs 10,000 crore in 2009-10 for implementing the fifth pay panels recommendations, finance minister Asim Dasgupta said today while presenting the vote-on-account.        
	The best-case scenario for finding the money will be a fast clearance of coal royalty dues by the new government at the Centre which owes the state Rs 9,494 crore. If a friendly government  say a third front dispensation  comes to power after the elections, Dasguptas task will be made easy.        
	The next-best option is Manmohan Singh returning to power, which can raise some hopes in his good friend Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee of a quick payment  never mind what Prakash Karat thinks.        
	But conscientious finance ministers such as Dasgupta are not susceptible to the charms of the imponderables of politics. So he has not factored in any such tantalising possibilities as coal dues or a dole from Delhi to meet half of the additional wage bills as demanded by some states.        
	I do not have any written commitment. So I have not factored them in. If those are cleared, I dont have to make additional borrowings, Dasgupta said.        
	Which leaves him with the other M: market borrowings. There has to be a way out and so we are thinking whether to go for additional borrowings. However, we havent yet decided on the borrowing amount, the minister said after tabling a Rs 7-crore-deficit vote-on-account.        
	Borrowings will add to the burden of the government which is said to be already paying Rs 13,000 crore a year as interest on past loans.        
	Bengal has to pay Rs 11,500 crore more for wages, pension and arrears. Of the total amount, Rs 10,000 crore has to be paid in the new financial year beginning next month. The state also has to fund the Rs 5,106-crore stimulus package announced last month.        
	The sops, which include rice for Rs 2 a kg for the poor and recruitment of 50,000 teachers, were announced before the model code of conduct kicked in but they have been reproduced in the budget.        
	Dasgupta is also hoping that tax collection would go up by 20 per cent from 17 per cent. The interim budget did not have new tax proposals because of the model code.        
	The Opposition said the vote-on-account was a Left poll manifesto and it would move the Election Commission, but Dasgupta denied the charge.  
	Your Debt  
	Bengal rsquo;s public debt has touched Rs 1.65 lakh crore which translates to over Rs 20,000 per person in the state

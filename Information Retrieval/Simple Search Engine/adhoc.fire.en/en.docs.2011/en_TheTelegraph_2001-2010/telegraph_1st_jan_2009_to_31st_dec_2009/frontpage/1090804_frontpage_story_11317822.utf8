The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Needed: neutral committee
                                                                                                           Needed: neutral committee
  - Expert suggests interference-free intelligence gathering                                  
	Maj. Gen. (retd) Gaganjit Singh is a veteran in counter-terrorism operations in Assam, having served as the GOC, Red Horns Division. Gen. Singh, who retired in 2004 having last served with the Defence Intelligence Agency looking after counter-terrorism, writes a series for The Telegraph on the growing concerns over Ulfa and NDFBs fresh incursions into Bhutan              
	The face of insurgency in Assam has changed to a great extent since Operation All Clear was successfully conducted by the Royal Bhutan Army (RBA) in 2003-2004 against Ulfa and NDFB rebels operating from the neighbouring country. Now that the Centre is once again asking the Unified Command to intensify vigil along Assams border with Bhutan and conduct operations in the border areas, I cannot help but go back in time.        
	Having commanded the Red Horns Division in lower Assam bordering Bhutan, I can assert that the RBA had conducted a very professional operation to evict every camp  large and small  of Ulfa and the NDFB. Since they were totally evicted, it is very difficult for them to re-establish any effective base in Bhutan again. That is why recent reports of both outfits setting up camps there are quite disturbing. Since Bhutan has denied the existence of transit/temporary camps after verification, it is time for serious rethinking. But before that we need to go back to an earlier period to understand issues connected with Ulfa to find the road ahead.        
	The outfit started with genuine causes  economic development and halt to influx from across the border  and enjoyed immense public support till the early nineties. Since then, the economic situation in Assam has improved and infrastructure created. , Currently, Ulfa has no cause. Sovereignty does not have the support of the public at large, reflected as it is from the 60 to 70 per cent turnout in the last few elections. It is clear that the people of Assam are satisfied with the present democratic form of government. It was and will remain a part of India. In the past two decades, Ulfa has been hit badly on all fronts  manpower, money and public support. Things have come to such a pass that it is outsourcing young people to carry out operations.        
	Their survival is because of support from intelligence sources of neighbouring countries and vested sources in our own country. However, being one of the oldest and largest outfits of the Northeast, they still maintain enough money and weapons and will always carry out operations to keep their name alive.         
	Incidentally, we have blamed the NDFB outright for the last two-three incidents, forgetting that a large part of this group is in a ceasefire and adheres to strict ground rules. On the other hand, Ulfa is not in a ceasefire and has got enough strength to strike. The other point I would like to mention here is that minority fundamentalist forces do exist in Assam but are lying low since their primary concern is the safety of their own people.        
	Given the evolving situation, the government should keep these points in mind before preparing a broad-based action plan. It should, at the same time, strengthen the intelligence set-up without interference from any quarters with the aim of resolving insurgency.         
	One way ahead would be for the Centreto constitute a committee having representatives from the intelligentsia, political class, police and the army to work out an action plan to establish lasting peace in Assam.        
	Next: Open mind towards Ulfa required

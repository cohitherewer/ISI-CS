The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Wall violation
                                                                                                           Wall violation
                                          
	At least three instances of violation of rules governing graffiti-writing on private walls have come out in the open because of an initiative by the Election Commission and Tollygunge police station.        
	Three houses are amoebic in a bustling city of millions but the cases stir hope as well as despair.        
	Hope because someone is finally moving to penalise those who browbeat helpless citizens to give up their individual freedom.        
	Despair because fear is a latent presence in a city that would like to be known as the cultural capital of the country. Citizens old enough to choose their rulers are terrified of standing up for their legal right  at a time of what is supposed to be the greatest celebration of choice  democracy  in the world.        
	The Telegraph is withholding the addresses and names of the three occupants mentioned in the accompanying reports because of the risks they run.        
	The three instances came to light because of a directive sent by Debashis Sen, the chief electoral officer of Bengal, to returning officers to be proactive, which prompted Tollygunge police to go on a verification mission.         
	We stopped wherever we saw graffiti written on walls and spoke to residents of the buildings individually to find out whether their permission was sought, an officer said.        
	The police could not get the response of the owners of two houses mentioned in the reports because they do not stay in the buildings. Even if the cadres have taken the permission of the owners, the police said the consent was not submitted three days before the paint job as the law requires.        
	The police have sent a report to the returning officer who is now expected to issue a notice to the party concerned  in these cases, the CPM.                    IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI AND MEGHDEEP BHATTACHARYYA

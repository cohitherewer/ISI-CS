          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             FBI chief Mueller in Delhi. (AFP)                                  
	New Delhi, March 3: FBI director Robert S. Mueller met home minister P. Chidambaram, national security adviser M.K. Narayanan and Intelligence Bureau director Rajiv Mathur on a day the Sri Lankan cricket team was attacked by terrorists in Pakistan.        
	In the talks with Chidambaram, Mueller discussed producing FBI witnesses in the case against Ajmal Kasab, the lone surviving gunman in the Mumbai attacks.        
	Special FBI agent Steven Merrill was on the scene and, sources said, he could be a key witness in the case against Kasab.         
	Mueller told intelligence officials India could take tips from Americas department of homeland security on how to make its multi-agency centre (MAC) more effective.        
	MAC, which was set up to co-ordinate between intelligence agencies but remained underutilised, was revived by Chidambaram after the Mumbai attacks.         
	Chidambaram wants it to be the centre that filters the intelligence gathered by different agencies and has the last word on threat perception and response, just like the department of homeland security in the US.        
	Officials from the department of homeland security and the US directorate of national intelligence attended the meeting, as did Muellers team of FBI officials.         
	From the Indian side, intelligence officials from the Intelligence Bureau, RAW and other wings were present.         
	Terrorism is not just a local issue. It is not an issue for one country. It is an issue across the world. To be successful we will have to work together, share intelligence and utilise our various judicial systems to bring to justice those responsible for these attacks, Mueller said in a written statement after meeting Chidambaram and Narayanan.        
	He pointed out that six Pakistani police officers had died in the attack on the Lankan team. This indicates how everyone needs to work together, Mueller said.

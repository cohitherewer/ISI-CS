The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Tibet topples China in Delhi
                                                                                                           Tibet topples China in Delhi
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 30: On the   eve of the 60th anniversary of   the Peoples Republic of   China, India has played with a   combustible word that could   ignite fireworks of a different   kind in Beijing.  
	A monthly report card re  leased by home minister P.   Chidambaram today men  tions construction on the   Indo-Tibet border, a depar  ture from the official Indo-  China border.   
	On the Indo-Tibet border,   work on construction of 10 roads totalling 196km is under   progress. 45.27km of formati  on works and 4.77km of surfa  cing works were completed in   September, he said, reading   from a written statement.  
	 If Chinese antennae live   up to their reputation and pick   up the variation, it will coin  cide with the Peoples Libera  tion Armys mar-ch and |  other celebrations in Beijing   tomorrow.																								   
	India has officially said several times that it considers   Ti-bet an integral part of Chi  na. Beijing does not appro-ve of   Indias asylum to the Dalai Lama, and New Delhi has more   or less ensured that the refer  ences to Tibet do not nettle   Beijing beyond a point.																								   
	However, with the recent   but vigorously denied reports   of incursions by China, the   Centre is also under pressure   to be seen as being firm.																								   
	Until last month, the parl  ance was on conventional   lines. On the Indo-China bor  der, 35.63km of formation   works and 2.82km of surfacing   works were completed, the   home minister had stated in   his report card for August.																								   
	So was the case in July. On   the Indo-China border,   35.63km of formation works   were completed, the home   ministry had said.																								   
	In official communication,   the government refers to the   international border as the   Indo-China border and not   Indo-Tibet border, a home   ministry official said.																								   
	A stickler for details, Chi  dambaram is known to check   every word of important com  munication. Semantics are a   key feature in international   relations, especially when an   inscrutable customer like   China is involved.																								   
	Even if the variation was   an error made somewhere do-  wn the line, till late tonight   there was no clarification   from the home ministry. It re  mains to be seen what the re  sponse will be if China makes   it an issue.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Black erased by Microsoft
                                                                                                           Black erased by Microsoft
                                Doctored                            
	London, Aug. 26: Microsoft has apologised for pasting a white mans head on a black mans body in a promotional photo on its official website.        
	The technology giant carried the crudely doctored image on a marketing page of the Polish version of its site.        
	The original photo featured three business people  one white, one black and one Asian  smiling as they attended a meeting.         
	It was published on Microsofts main US site, to advertise the companys business productivity software.        
	But in the version doctored to appeal to Polish customers, the black mans face was replaced with that of a white man  although the original models hand remained clearly visible.         
	The deception was spotted by eagle-eyed web users and circulated widely on the Internet before it was taken down by Microsoft.        
	The US-based firm apologised for the race swap in a message on its official Twitter feed and said it was investigating who was responsible. Marketing site photo mistake  sincere apologies  were in the process of taking down the image, it tweeted.        
	An official spokesman added: We are looking into the details of this situation.        
	Microsoft is not the first organisation to be caught out for changing the race of someone featured in an image.         
	A black man was pasted into a group family shot on the front cover of a Toronto guide in an attempt to reflect the citys diversity.

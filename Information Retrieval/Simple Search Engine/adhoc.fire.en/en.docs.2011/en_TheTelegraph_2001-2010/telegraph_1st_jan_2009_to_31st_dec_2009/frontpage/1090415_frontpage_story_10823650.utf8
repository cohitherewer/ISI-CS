	Washington, April 13 (AP): Bo the Portuguese water dog makes his official move into the White House, and how President Barack Obama and his family introduce him to his new home  and the world  will say much about their skills as novice dog owners.        
	The White House will be the puppys fourth home in his six months of life. He was born in Texas, then moved to his first owners home in Washington then spent nearly a month with Senator Edward Kennedys dog trainer in Virginia, and now is moving again.        
	A dog can become disoriented when moving to a new home, said Cesar Millan, host of the National Geographic Channels The Dog Whisperer and co-founder with his wife of a non-profit foundation to help abused and abandoned dogs.        
	Being disoriented can lead an animal to become anxious, to become nervous, to become fearful, Millan said. In some situations they get really excited. So, regardless which state of mind the dog might go into, thats not going to be good for the dog.        
	Among Millans top tips: Day one or day two or day three, there should be a lot of walking involved. And before the dog eats, he should be very hungry, because that helps him to understand that the humans are helping him to work for food and water.         
	Focus on establishing a routine to help the dog calm down, rather than comforting him and using his name a lot when he is upset, Millan said.        
	Bo was given up by his first owner because things were not working out with the familys other dog. Kennedy and his wife Victoria, who had two Portuguese water dogs from Bos breeder and acquired a third from Bos litter, thought Bo would be perfect for the Obamas, and gave the dog to the Obama daughters, Malia and Sasha, as a gift.

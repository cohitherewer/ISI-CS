The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Role swap rider in AGP, BJP tie-up
                                                                                                           Role swap rider in AGP, BJP tie-up
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                     
	New Delhi, March 5: The AGP has agreed to play second fiddle to the BJP in the seat-sharing scheme for the ensuing Lok Sabha election after extracting a promise that during Assembly elections it will have the larger share.        
	The BJP took the bigger bite of the Lok Sabha pie with eight of the 14 seats in Assam. Announcing the seat-sharing plan, BJP president Rajnath Singh said the AGP would be the bigger partner in the Assembly election.         
	The agreements mean that the two parties are looking at a long-term relationship and the current arrangement will certainly not be the basis for seat sharing in the 2011 Assembly election.         
	The AGP, of course, has good reasons to ask for a larger share in the Assembly polls.         
	The BJP had performed better in the 2004 Lok Sabha election, polling 22.94 per cent votes against the AGPs 19.95 per cent.         
	But in the 2006 Assembly election, the AGP won 28 seats with 18.83 per cent votes against the BJPs 10 seats with 10.88 per cent votes.         
	The BJP-AGP pact for Lok Sabha polls might prove effective as their combined votes of 42.89 per cent surpasses the Congresss 35.07 per cent.         
	The announcement of the pact was delayed by a day because the BJP was initially not willing to commit itself on the Assembly election tie-up as it could have prompted other allies to extract similar commitments.         
	The BJP eventually yielded to the AGP pressure, reluctantly though, and the 8:6 formula for the Lok Sabha polls was announced.         
	There was a hitch over the Guwahati seat in the beginning, with the AGP not willing to spare it for former BJP Union minister Bijoya Chakraborty.         
	As the agreement stands now, the seats to be contested by the AGP are Dibrugarh, Lakhimpur, Tezpur, Barpeta, Kaliabor and Kokrajhar.         
	The BJP will contest from Guwahati, Nagaon, Mangaldoi, Jorhat, Dhubri, Silchar, Karimganj and Diphu.         
	L.K. Advani himself has stressed the importance of the BJPs alliance with the AGP, a party that too was born out of a nationalist movement.         
	He said this alliance would not only affect the electoral fortunes of the parties in Assam but also the entire Northeast.         
	He regretted that the AGP quit the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in 2004 because of certain misgivings. Advani didnt miss this opportunity to slam the Third Front, of which the AGP was a part of till recently.         
	This argument, in addition to the BJPs pet anti-Congress policy, has been used by the party to lure prospective allies.         
	The BJP has been wary of the emergence of a third front, as many of its allies have drifted away in the name of secularism.

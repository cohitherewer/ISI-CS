The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Lalu hits back with sermon for Sonia
                                                                                                           Lalu hits back with sermon for Sonia
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                 
	New Delhi, March 21: Unshackled of obligations by the Congresss decision to contest most of Bihars 40 Lok Sabha seats, RJD boss Lalu Prasad revealed flashes of his former arrogant self, directly defying Sonia Gandhi by stating her partys ambitions in the state were vastly exaggerated.        
	Why should we have given more seats to the Congress in Bihar? To lose them for the UPA? Let me be very clear, the Congress is no force in Bihar, and this is something Soniaji will realise after the results are out, he told journalists this afternoon.         
	Lalu Prasad has been under severe attack  and cold-shouldered by Sonia since he and Ram Vilas Paswan carved up most of Bihar between themselves  for stabbing the Congress in the back.         
	But the former Bihar chief minister today returned the salvos in good measure. Where is the Congress in Bihar? Does it want to lose the battle for the UPA? Nothing more, nothing, we have given them more than their share of the seats. We are part of the UPA but we are not in this to lose the game to our enemies.         
	The visibly rankled RJD chief denied he had been seeking an appointment with Sonia to placate her and said: I am saying this very clearly, if you want to retain the UPA and if you want the UPA to win, this is the best way. The Congress has no ground to ask for more in Bihar.         
	Although he did not put it in so many words, Lalu Prasad has bluntly dared the Congress to pick other partners in Bihar and improve its showing. I have no problems if they do not want the UPA to remain any more, I am part of the UPA today, but if it ceases to exist, I will consider myself free and independent. I am in the field of battle now and that is the last of what I have to say.           
	Lalu Prasad may have calculated well before confronting the Congress frontally. He does not expect the Congress to improve on its current tally  three Lok Sabha MPs  in the coming elections. Therefore, in his book, each additional seat granted to the party is a waste, or a gift to the JD(U)-BJP alliance. So he has decided to risk a temporary break with the Congress in the interest of giving his RJD and Paswans LJP  decidedly more grounded parties in Bihar than the Congress  the chance to wrest as many seats as possible from the NDA.                   
	It is equally true that the intention behind Lalu Prasad hogging the lions share of seats is that he wants to be in a position where he can bargain with the UPA on his own terms in the new Lok Sabha.         
	Congress leader and Bihar in-charge Sushil Kumar Shinde accused the RJD and LJP of not adhering to coalition dharma but gifted a small concession to his allies on paper  the Congress will not contest the three seats Lalu and Paswan are contesting  Patliputra and Saran (Lalu) and Hajipur (Paswan).         
	The RJD chief, however, was in no mood to feel grateful. If the Congress decides to contest these three seats, let them, we will also put up candidates in the seats that we have left for them, he said. In any case, the three seats the Congress won in 2004 were not because of that party, it is our workers and voters who won the seats for them.         
	Lalu Prasad maintained, however, that he respected Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh but said though the UPA chairperson was innocent, her coterie was not. Bahut manager munshi hai unke aas paas to! (There are many managers and cashiers trying to influence her), he said.         
	There is a personal element to the unfolding Lalu-Congress tussle  Sadhu Yadav, the RJD bosss brother-in-law and former MP from Gopalganj, has rebelled and joined the Congress. In all likelihood, Sadhu will contest the Bettiah seat against filmmaker Prakash Jha of the LJP. Many believe he has Lalu Prasads secret blessings against the LJP, but Lalu himself was swift to scotch any such speculation. He may be my brother-in-law, but he is not in my party any more, I hope you get the message, I hope everybody does.

          PRONAB MONDAL AND ZEESHAN JAWED                            Lunch being distributed to the state force. Amit Datta                                  
	Bhimpur, June 19: What Russia taught Napoleon Bonaparte around 200 years ago, the Bengal government has not learnt even now: an army marches on its stomach.        
	Several state police personnel taking part in the Lalgarh operation queued up this morning in front of a grocery store in Bhimpur, not looking for Maoists but waiting to buy bread and puffed rice.        
	I had my last proper meal on Tuesday night. There is hardly any provision for food and drinking water, an assistant sub-inspector said.        
	Waiting in vain for over three hours outside the Bhimpur Santal High School for breakfast, some Rapid Action Force (RAF) personnel requested Moloy Roy, the owner of the small store in Bhimpur, to open the shop.         
	After carrying out the operation through the day, we were given a packet of khichri last night. We didnt get any food this morning and, as all the shops are closed here, we couldnt buy anything. Somehow, we managed to get the address of the owner and requested him to open the store, said a middle-aged man in uniform.        
	Within a few minutes, the famished force lapped up ready-to-eat items such as bread, puffed rice, chanachur and nimki.        
	As Roys stocks ran out, the next batch of police personnel returned empty handed from the 8ftx6ft store to the school camp. The single-storeyed school premises in Bhimpur, around 9km from Lalgarh, is the base for the operation.        
	Inside the camp, the central forces looked relaxed as they got ready for a lunch of rice, dal, roti and sabzi. The supplies for the central forces, along with cooks and gas cylinders, had reached Bhimpur within hours of their arrival.         
	The central force moves with their ration but the state forces normally procure these items locally, which is the responsibility of the local police administration. In the middle of all the action, they may have forgotten to make the arrangements, said an RAF officer.        
	Such amnesia can be disastrous. Napoleon had learnt the importance of supply lines from his own experience in Russia from where he had to retreat because his troops were emaciated by the time they reached Moscow in 1812.        
	With discontent brewing among the Bengal force, senior officers arranged for lunch. A pick-up van carrying the lunch rolled into the campus around 3.30pm. Pandemonium followed as policemen from rushed towards the vehicle from all corners.         
	Within 20 minutes, the supplies  rice, dal and boiled eggs  were exhausted and many were left high and dry. I was in the Sunderbans for the relief work after Aila Todays scene at the school campus was very similar to what I had seen in Aila-affected villages, said an ASI who missed his lunch.

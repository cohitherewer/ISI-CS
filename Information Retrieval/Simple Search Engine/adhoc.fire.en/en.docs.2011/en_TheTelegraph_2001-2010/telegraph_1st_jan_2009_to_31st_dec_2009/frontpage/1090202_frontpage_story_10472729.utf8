The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | State readies rebel surrender policy
                                                                                                           State readies rebel surrender policy
          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                            Mainstream calling: Red army                                  
	Ranchi, Feb. 1: Promptly reacting to Union home minister P. Chidambarams directive, Jharkhand has drafted a surrender policy to help rehabilitate Naxalites and make them join the mainstream.        
	Police spokesperson and inspector-general (modernisation) S.N. Pradhan told The Telegraph that the policy is in its final stages.        
	Official sources said that a draft of the rehabilitation and surrender policy has been submitted for the governors approval and should be ready for fine-tuning in the next couple of days.         
	The governor is likely to discuss the draft with his three advisers  G. Krishnan, Sunila Basant and T.P. Sinha. Among the three, Sinha also happens to be the first director-general of police (DGP) of Jharkhand and is well acquainted with the rebel problem.        
	Chidambaram, during his meeting with officials yesterday, had specifically asked the state to come up with a new surrender policy for Naxalites, who will, however, be rehabilitated by the Centre once they decide to join the social mainstream.         
	Incidentally, the proposed policy has been left hanging by previous governments for quite some time now. The successive governments led by Arjun Munda, Madhu Koda and Shibu Soren have been dilly-dallying the finalisation.         
	The draft policy is supposed to be an updated and revised version of the hitherto unexecuted original policy worked out by the states first chief minister Babulal Marandi.         
	The new policy incorporates all the positive aspects of the original and provisions of a similar policy adopted by Andhra Pradesh and Orissa. It talks of security mainly and provides a good rehabilitation package, a senior official said, requesting anonymity.        
	The proposed policy talks of protecting the interests of those who surrender, he added.         
	According to sources, the new policy proposes to minimise the sentence of a rebel who surrenders, provides land and financial support and ensures security for the rebels family.         
	The purpose is to inculcate an interest among those men and women who join rebel outfits under extreme circumstances. The policys success will depend on the initial response, a source said.         
	However, it is just one of the many options before a rebel. Along with the policy, stringent anti-Naxalite operations will also continue, as our experience shows that surrender policies work well where police are in a position of strength and the Naxalites are on the run, the official maintained.        
	Sources in the intelligence, however, doub the efficacy of the proposed policy and wonder whether the bait of a fixed monthly salary would be good enough to lure the rebels. More so when Naxalites, reportedly, earned crores from the state in the form of levy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | India pushes Pak for action 
                                                                                                           India pushes Pak for action 
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                       Singh                          
	Rome, July 7: India is firm it will not reopen the composite dialogue with Pakistan unless it serves up demonstrable evidence of action against the plotters of the Mumbai terror attack.        
	We are way beyond being taken in by excuses and assurances, highly placed sources said as Prime Minister Manmohan Singh flew into Italy tonight for three days of summiteering with G8 and G5 nation heads. If Pakistan can act against the Taliban, why not against those who plan attacks on India from their soil? Indian public opinion wont support a dialogue unless Pakistan does something concrete.        
	The Indian foreign secretary, Shiv Shankar Menon, is to meet his Pakistani counterpart during the NAM summit at Sharm-al-Sheikh in Egypt next Tuesday prior to a scheduled one-on-one between Prime Minister Singh and Pakistani Premier Yousuf Raza Gilani. A lot of what happens at those meetings will depend on whether Pakistani authorities act in the intervening period.        
	The foreign office establishment wouldnt define demonstrable action in concrete terms but one of the measures it could construe as a positive signal is moving against leading terror actors like Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi of the Lashkar-e-Toiba, who is alleged to have brainworked the Mumbai assault.        
	Pakistan has consistently promised action against him and other apparatchiks of the terror network based there but offered no proof of intent.        
	The Prime Minister had held out the control terror conditionality to Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari, in full media glare on the sidelines of the BRIC summit at Yekaterinberg in Russia last month. Zardari was meant to have followed up that meeting at the NAM summit but Islamabad changed its mind subsequently and decided to send Prime Minister Gilani to Egypt.        
	The switch on the Pakistani side has been interpreted as its way of reacting to the slight of being reminded on terror in public at Yekaterinberg. But the Indian side appears unperturbed by the reaction Prime Minister Singhs open reminder to Zardari may have evoked. Who Pakistan sends to the NAM summit is their decision, we have to deal with whoever is their leader or representative, sources said.        
	Although climate change and the global economic downturn will dominate the agenda at the Coppito G8 summit over the next three days, Singh is also scheduled to have a series of bilateral meetings on the sidelines. These include one-on-one sessions with Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and possibly US President Barack Obama.        
	Should Pakistan come up during these meetings, the sources suggested, India will press its disappointment over Islamabads refusal to act against terror outfits operating freely in Pakistan and daily fanning anti-India sentiment.        
	Revealing a sense that New Delhi wants to up the diplomatic ante on the issue, sources questioned the credibility of the Pakistani ban on terror outfits and even Islamabads claim that the Mumbai attack was the work of non-state actors. They may not all be state actors but the state has to deal with them, the sources said. Besides, there has been activity that suggests state collusion.        
	 As an illustration to the charge, the sources referred to instances where Thuraya satellite phones used by the Mumbai attackers had been spoofed. Spoofing is a trick by which the location of satellite phones or other sensitive equipment can be masked. The implication quite clearly is that spoofing could not have been managed without the assistance of Pakistani state agencies.        
	India has been under some international pressure, leveraged particularly hard by the US, to resume dialogue with Pakistan as a means to lowering tensions in the subcontinent but South Block isnt dropping any hints that it is wilting without conditions. The world has told us it understands our position. Even the US has said it is upon India and Pakistan to decide the time and place of dialogue. We think it cannot happen unless Pakistan shows determination to tackle those who are using its soil to launch attacks on us, the sources said.

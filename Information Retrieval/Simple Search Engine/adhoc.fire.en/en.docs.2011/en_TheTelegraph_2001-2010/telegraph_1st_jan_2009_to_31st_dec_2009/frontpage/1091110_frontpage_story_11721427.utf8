  - What it meant to be at so sacred a place in a tragic century           SERGE SCHMEMANN                                                 
	There was nothing through most of that grey, chilly Thursday to suggest that it would come to symbolise one of the great transitions of the 20th century, the triumphant end of a failed system.        
	Even when the delirious crowds surged through the Berlin Wall shortly before midnight on November 9, 1989, it was not because of any momentous decision or heroic feat; it was because of a bad translation, a confused border guard and a natural longing for a better life.        
	That is not to say that the event history has declared as the moment when the Cold War ended came out of the blue. From the time Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power in the Kremlin in 1985 proclaiming change, the Soviet bloc had been in turmoil.        
	But there was nothing on that Thursday morning that said: This is the day. The brightly lit no-mans-land between the concrete slabs that stretched around West Berlin was barren, save for rabbits that had flourished in the total security of the zone. It was studded with 302 heavily armed watchtowers on one side and a few makeshift tourist platforms on the other, from which western visitors threw lettuce to the bunnies.         
	I was in East Berlin on that November day. On that Thursday, we were told that East German leaders would announce a major loosening of travel restrictions. Their calculation was that if East Germans did not feel so imprisoned in the East, they would not be so desperate to flee to the West.        
	Gnter Schabowski, a member of the East German politburo, was designated to announce the new travel regulations at a news conference in the late afternoon. I had no way of filing to the paper from East Berlin, so even before he finished I rushed back to get through Checkpoint Charlie ahead of the mob of newsmen. All through the evening there were reports that people were gathering at checkpoints on both sides. As midnight approached, I was writing away in my room at the Kempinski Hotel in West Berlin when there came a knock on the door. It was Victor Homola, my translator from East Berlin.        
	Im busy, Victor, I snapped.        
	But, Serge        
	Not now! Not now        
	Wait! Victor was an East German. He was not allowed to cross into the West!         
	Hed never been to the West! And it was midnight.        
	Victor, what on earth are you doing here?        
	Thats what Im trying to tell you, Serge. The wall is open!        
	After the media conference, it turned out, Schabowski had been cornered by reporters who asked him to elaborate on the new rules. Did he mean to say, he was asked, that the wall was opening immediately? Immediately, he mumbled in some confusion.        
	Within minutes, West German television and radio were trumpeting the news to the East, and Berliners East and West began converging on the crossings.        
	Victor was among them, at the Bornholmer Strasse crossing. The officer in charge there anxiously waited for orders  either shoot, let people get crushed against the barrier, or open it. At 11.14pm  about four hours after Schabowskis fateful fumble  the officer ordered the barrier opened. Victor was among the first ones through; before long, divided Berlin was in the throes of one grand party.        
	It was so fine a moment, and one that two decades later occupies so sacred a place in the history of a tragic century, that it takes an effort today to recall how spontaneous and unexpected the breach really was.        
	The West has since devised various narratives of the Fall of the Berlin Wall, most claiming a great victory for the West, or at least for a western-oriented civil society in the East. It was a great victory, of course, in the sense that our freedoms and prosperity became so incomparably more attractive than the Big Brother and drabness of the Soviet bloc that communist leaders simply could no longer sustain or enforce the myth of socialist superiority.        
	Yet apart perhaps from Poland, the changes in Eastern Europe were led more by enlightened (or ambitious) communists than by dissidents. And the fatal impulse came from within  in fact from Moscow  when Gorbachev and his allies recognised that their system simply could not go on as it was, and in 1991 when Boris Yeltsin dissolved the Soviet empire.        
	Lets be honest: On November 9, 1989, none of the experts  not reporters, not politicians, not diplomats, not analysts  imagined that the mighty communist edifice, with its great armies, its vast networks of secret police and informers, its elaborate controls on information and its privileged castes, would fall anytime soon. Reunification was in the air, to be sure, but not today, not tomorrow, not for a decade or so.         
	Lets be more honest still: Many in the West found a degree of comfort in the wall. It allowed us to feel superior, it divided our world into manageable blocs. Many Americans would like to think that President Ronald Reagan precipitated the fall of the Wall with his celebrated plea, Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall. But that was two years before it happened, and Gorbachev had already introduced his fateful reforms. The uncomfortable fact is that many Europeans, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain and President Franois Mitterrand of France most notable among them, opposed the reunification of Germany to the last minute.        
	So, perhaps it is the very spontaneity of the breach of the Berlin Wall that makes it so apt a symbol for the collapse of communist rule. The wall burst open simply because there was nothing left to prop it up  the Moscow Centre had ceased to hold, the entire edifice of fear and lies was exhausted, the police were no longer prepared to shoot.        
	All it needed was a nudge, which Schabowski inadvertently provided on one grey and chilly Thursday. He also provided the delicious irony that the Wall finally came down for the same reason it had gone up 28 years earlier  to dissuade East Germans from fleeing to freedom.        
	In the 20 years since, the US has not fared well in the role of sole superpower. Russia has come to see the collapse of its Soviet empire as a humiliation, and has revived many of its old bullying habits.        
	Yet when I look back on that night 20 years ago, when I rushed from my hotel to the wall with Victor Homola and my West German assistant, Thomas Seibert, I still feel an incomparable exhilaration.        
	I still sense the extraordinary and elementary spirit of liberation that we witnessed across East Europe in those years.        
	To have been at these places, to have been at the Berlin Wall on November 9, 1989, is to have known a moment when all the calculations of power and politics are overwhelmed by a single-minded quest.        
	Call it freedom.

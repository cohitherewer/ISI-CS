                                Tautou: Unusual hobby                            
	New York, Sept. 21 (PTI): Da Vinci Code star Audrey Tautou has an unusual hobby of collecting photos of every person who has interviewed her.         
	The French actress regularly takes pictures of journalists she speaks with so she doesnt forget them, and hopes one day to incorporate the snaps into a project, reports the New York Daily News.        
	The actress likes to believe that it is not a waste of time spending short moments with so many people and prefers to hold on to them in the form of pictures.         
	I havent done anything with the photos yet. I just keep them. But its just because I have met so many people for very short moments and all these moments for me disappear into the air.         
	I find it a bit unreal. So I wanted to keep something concrete to make sure I was not wasting my time, said Tautou.         
	The Amelie star has also said that she is not ready to settle down in Hollywood, even though she might be starring in films there. I like to visit Hollywood, but I wouldnt like to settle there. I like movement, I like surprise. I dont think about my work in terms of a career.         
	I have the ambition to try to do very good movies and try to work with great directors and I try to do my best. I feel myself as being more of an artisan than as an actress, said Tautou.         
	In her latest film, Coco before Chanel, Tautou portrays Gabrielle Coco Chanel before she became a designer.

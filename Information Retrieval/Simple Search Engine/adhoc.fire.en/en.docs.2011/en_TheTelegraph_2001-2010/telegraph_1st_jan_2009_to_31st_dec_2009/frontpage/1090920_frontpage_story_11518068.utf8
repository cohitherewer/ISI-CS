          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranchi, Sept. 19: CPI(Maoist) rebels blew up a major portion of a community hall in the Burger Bazar locality of Bhandaria block in Garhwa district today, but no casualty was reported.        
	According to Garhwa district police chief Saket Kumar Singh, the incident occurred around 2am. The situation, he added, was under control and efforts were on to nab the culprits.        
	Traffic on NH-75, linking Ranchi with Daltonganj, too, remained suspended today because of a bandh called by another banned outfit, PLFI. Normal life in the Panki area of adjoining Palamau district was also thrown out of gear because of the bandh.         
	Residents of Latehar and the Palamau-Garwah region, however, heaved a sigh of relief after PLFI sub-zonal commander Sheo Shankar Yadav, alias Laxman Yadav, who had been arrested, was produced before a judicial magistrate and forwarded to jail.        
	This led the PLFI to call off its indefinite Jharkhand bandh call.        
	According to PLFI sources, Yadav became a sub-zonal commander a couple of days back. He was arrested by the Latehar police last Thursday, but wasnt produced before a magistrate within 24 hours.         
	The PLFI then called a bandh in Latehar district, which virtually affected the entire Palamau division.        
	The police, on the other hand, maintained that Yadav was arrested last evening. One 9mm pistol, five cartridges, two mobile phones and Naxalite literature were seized from him.        
	Police spokesman S.N. Pradhan denied the PLFIs allegations, saying no such case was pending wherein an accused had been arrested but not produced in court.

          ALEX WILLIAMS                            Grating to many                                  
	New York, June 22: For the first half-hour of the meeting, it was hardly surprising to see a potential client fiddling with his iPhone, said Rowland Hobbs, the chief executive of a marketing firm in Manhattan.         
	At an hour, it seemed a bit much. And after an hour and a half, Hobbs and his colleagues wondered what the man could possibly be doing with his phone for the length of a summer blockbuster.         
	Someone peeked over his shoulder. He was playing a racing game, Hobbs said. He did ask questions, though, peering occasionally over his iPhone. But, Hobbs added: We didnt say anything. We still wanted the business.        
	As web-enabled smartphones have become standard on the belts and in the totes of executives, people in meetings are increasingly caving in to temptation to check email, Facebook, Twitter, even (shhh!) ESPN.com.         
	But a spirited debate about etiquette has broken out. Traditionalists say the use of BlackBerrys and iPhones in meetings is as gauche as ordering out for pizza. Techno-evangelists insist that to ignore real-time text messages in a need-it-yesterday world is to invite peril.         
	In Hollywood, both the Creative Artists Agency and United Talent Agency ban BlackBerry use at meetings. Tom Golisano, a billionaire and power broker in New York state politics, said last week that he pushed to remove Malcolm A. Smith as the state Senate majority leader after the senator met him on budget matters in April and spent the time reading email on his BlackBerry.        
	The phone use has become routine in the corporate and political worlds  and grating to many. A third of more than 5,300 workers polled in May by Yahoo HotJobs, a career research and job listings website, said they frequently checked email in meetings. Nearly 20 per cent said they had been castigated for poor manners regarding wireless devices.        
	Despite resistance, the etiquette debate seems to be tilting in the favour of smartphone use, many executives said. Managing directors do it. Summer associates do it. It spans gender and generation, private and public sectors.        
	A few years ago, only the investment banker types would use BlackBerrys in meetings.                            NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

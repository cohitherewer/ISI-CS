The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | PC in Imphal, Dimapur today
                                                                                                           PC in Imphal, Dimapur today
  - Minister to discuss law and order during maiden tour          OUR BUREAU                                          
	New Delhi/Imphal, Feb. 2: Union home minister P. Chidambaram will pay a maiden visit to Manipur and Nagaland tomorrow to review law and order in the two states.         
	During a three-hour whirlwind tour to Imphal, he will meet Governor Gurbachan Jagat, chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh, the council of ministers and senior state government officials. He will hold a separate meeting with senior officers of the army and Assam Rifles as well as police officials.         
	The situation arising out of the siege of Siroy in Ukhrul district, where a stand-off between security forces and the NSCN (Isak-Muivah) ended today, as well as valley-based insurgency are likely to figure in the review meeting.         
	Chidambaram will hold similar discussions with chief minister Neiphiu Rio and senior officials at Chumukedima near Dimapur.         
	The Naga areas of Manipur have become a bone of contention between the two states as the NSCN (I-M)s demand for Greater Nagalim finds support among sections in Manipur as well.         
	In fact, five Naga legislators from Manipur reached the capital today and sought an appointment with the home minister. We wanted to apprise him of what is going on in Shirui (Siroy) but he has not met us, one of them said.         
	The home minister will, in all probability, draw his own conclusions about the situation involving the two states.         
	Overall, he has sent a clear message to insurgent groups in the Northeast that they cannot endlessly carry on with violence. Even peace talks should fall within a time-frame.         
	Keen on finding a permanent political solution to the decades-old Naga insurgency, Chidambaram had said on Saturday that negotiations with the NSCN (I-M) would continue. But the talks would adhere to a brief to interlocutor K. Padmanabhaiah.         
	He is also likely to emphasise the need for ensuring strict enforcement of ceasefire ground rules as the infighting between Naga groups has been a matter of anguish for the home ministry.

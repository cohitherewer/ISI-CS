The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Wanted: Houses for House-hit comrades
                                                                                                           Wanted: Houses for House-hit comrades
          JAYANTH JACOB                                               
	New Delhi, May 19: Cut to size in the august House, the CPM is now facing a housekeeping challenge.        
	With 16 MPs  against 44 last time  and fewer senior members, the party is grappling with a space crunch for at least 25 families of workers who associate with the CPM in many ways.        
	Although there are no hard and fast rules, the senior MPs  four terms or more  are allotted bungalows while others get flats in specified residential quarters meant for members of Parliament.        
	This time, many senior Lok Sabha MPs have lost, so there will be fewer bungalows. A bungalow helps because it can accommodate many families. For instance, some 10 families stay at the 15 Talkatora bungalow, allotted to A. Vijayaraghavan, the CPM Rajya Sabha member from Kerala  and the MP stays in a VP House flat.        
	The 10 families are safe, but the occupants of the bungalow at 4 B.D. Marg in the capital could face problems if a party MP is not allocated the house this time. The incumbent, six-time MP Hannan Mollah, has lost the election in Bengal.        
	The same problem stalks 4 Ashoka Road, allotted to Anil Basu, which houses the partys agriculture wing. Basu did not contest this time.        
	20 Janpath  not that close to 10 Janpath despite the arithmetic proximity  holds a special place for the CPM because the late ideologue and former general secretary, E.M.S. Namboodiripad, once stayed there. The bungalow had been allotted to CPM veteran Varkala Radhakrishnan who did not contest this time.        
	Radhakrishnans seat in Kerala has been among the few retained by the CPM this time but the winner, A. Sampath, is a second-time MP and not eligible for a bungalow.        
	Other senior CPM MPs who wont be in the Lok Sabha include Rupchand Pal and Tarit Topdar (both six terms).         
	Then there is the problem of reallocation. For instance, the bungalow at 6 Rajendra Prasad Road was given out in the name of Babu Rao from Andhra and was shared by P. Madhu, a Rajya Sabha MP. Rao lost this election, which means Madhu may have to be shifted to a flat.         
	But some CPM house-managers are hoping that the housing committee of Parliament, which allocates accommodation, will allow the party to put up a senior MP in the bungalow, which will preclude the need for Madhu to shift.        
	The office of the partys mouthpiece from Bengal, Ganashakti, is safe is as it is housed on 21 Ashoka Road, which is the bungalow of Basudeb Acharya, who won this time, too.        
	But the partys organ in Kerala, Deshabhimani, has its office in a VP House flat and needs readjustment. The flat was allotted to A.P. Abdullakutty, who praised Narendra Modis performance, got expelled from the CPM and joined the Congress.        
	If guidelines are strictly applied, 8 Teen Murti Lane will also be affected. The bungalow was allotted to the late Harkishen Singh Surjeet when he was the general secretary of the CPM. As it was issued from the quota meant for leaders of national parties, technically the building should have been occupied by the current leader, Prakash Karat. But sources suggested that party would like Surjeets family members to stay there.

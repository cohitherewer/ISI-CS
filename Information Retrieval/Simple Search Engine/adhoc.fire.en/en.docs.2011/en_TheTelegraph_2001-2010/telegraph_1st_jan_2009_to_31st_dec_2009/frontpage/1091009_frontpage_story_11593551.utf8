The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Buta blasts govt over SC quota 
                                                                                                           Buta blasts govt over SC quota 
  - National panel rap for backlog of vacancies and non-utilisation of funds          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Buta Singh at the news conference. (Sanjib Mukherjee)                                        
	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 8: The Naveen Patnaik governments claim to have worked tirelessly for Dalits was rubbished by National Commission for Scheduled Castes chairman Buta Singh who held a news meet in the state capital today.         
	Indicting the government, Singh told the media that Orissa had failed to furnish updated and complete information regarding the backlog of vacancies reserved for the SC communities, disposal of cases of atrocity against them and utilisation of funds.        
	We have been sending questionnaires to the government since 2007, but we have not received a complete reply. Information provided was neither specific nor was it supported by statistics, Singh said, adding that the officials had failed to provide details for 2008-09 as well. We received lectures instead of information, he added.        
	Singh also alleged that central guidelines and Supreme Court directives in respect of filling vacancies reserved for SC communities were ignored by the state. The chairman pointed out that though Orissa was the first state to enact legislation in 1975 for reservation, changes that took place in the past 34 years were not incorporated in the state law.         
	Though the Supreme Court directed that reservation should be based on posts and not on vacancies, Orissa is still reserving posts on the basis of vacancies. The apex courts directives  no backlog of vacancies and de-reservation of posts  were also flouted.        
	The chairman added that though 16.35 per cent of the states population comprises SC people, only 15 per cent of government posts were reserved for them, a violation of central guidelines and constitutional norms.         
	Expressing his dismay over the states failure in disposing cases relating to atrocities against SC communities, Singh noted that as many as 6,389 of the total 6,555 cases were pending in 2006-07.         
	Only 100-odd cases were settled, that too, in favour of the accused.         
	Pointing to the failure in respect of SC education, he said 85 per cent of SC children were dropping out of schools before completing Class V.        
	The Orissa government has failed to utilise central funds released under special component plan and centrally sponsored schemes for SC development and the allocation of states matching share was also inadequate, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Expert trio play truant, get back at BJP
                                                                                                           Expert trio play truant, get back at BJP
          SANJAY K. JHA                                    Jaswant Singh, Yashwant Sinha, Arun Shourie				                                 
	New Delhi, July 6: Pranab Mukherjees budget ended up highlighting a deficit - in the BJP.        
	The gap showed when the time came for the main Opposition party to give its reaction to  in other words, rip into  the budget proposals. The BJPs trio of economics experts were nowhere to be seen.        
	Jaswant Singh, Yashwant Sinha and Arun Shourie, all recently turned dissident, chose to leave the party in the lurch just when their services were needed the most. In their absence, the BJPs formal reaction to the budget had to depend on vague political rhetoric instead of specific economic criticism.        
	Jaswant, Yashwant and Shourie usually analyse the budget before the media on the partys behalf. This year, they are angry at the leaderships efforts to protect and reward those they think are behind the BJPs Lok Sabha poll debacle.        
	So Jaswant left Delhi for his village, while Yashwant delivered a stinging snub by choosing the media over party. Sushma Swaraj, who eventually briefed the media, admitted that Yashwant had informed the party that he was engaged for the day.        
	Shourie was untraceable. Worse, Murli Manohar Joshi, another leader who understands economics, attended the House during the budget presentation but fled the national capital soon after.        
	Joshi, whose running battle with L.K. Advani has been a constant source of embarrassment for the party, has, however, expressed a desire to lead the discussion on the budget in the Lok Sabha. Even Yashwant will participate in the debate, indicating a plan to register individual brilliance, thrown into relief against the partys deficiencies.        
	As these leaders absence dawned on the leadership, Advani called a meeting to prepare the BJPs formal response to the budget. Among those who attended were Sushma, party president Rajnath Singh, Arun Jaitley, Venkaiah Naidu, S.S. Ahluwalia, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Rajiv Pratap Rudy and Prakash Javadekar.        
	These leaders would have had no problem taking apart any move or proclamation by the government on a political issue, but none of them is known for a deep understanding of financial and monetary intricacies.         
	The statement issued after the meeting was forced to harp on commonplace expressions like lacklustre, dry, boring and disappointing. It spoke of past failures to create jobs and insufficient tax relief, and made the customary insinuation that the proposals were inflationary.        
	The BJP said the budget didnt have anything that would reverse the downturn, was deficient in new ideas and would not enhance economic activities.         
	It accused Mukherjee of squandering a great opportunity but did not say what the BJP would have done in his place to inject the economy with new life.        
	Rajnath raised eyebrows further by issuing a separate statement. It repeated the same run-of-the-mill complaints.

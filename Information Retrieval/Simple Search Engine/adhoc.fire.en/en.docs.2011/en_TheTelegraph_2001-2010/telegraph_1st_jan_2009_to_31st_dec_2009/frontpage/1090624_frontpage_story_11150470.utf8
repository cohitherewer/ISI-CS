          OUR BUREAU                              
	Ranchi/Jamshedpur, June 23: Rebel blasts reduced to rubble portions of the panchayat office at Saraidih in the Chhatarpur area of Palamau district on the final day of the CPI(Maoist) bandh today.         
	Concerned over heightened rebel activity along the Bengal-Jharkhand border and intelligence reports suggesting Maoist influx from Lalgarh in West Midnapore, director-general of police V.D. Ram sent an SOS to the Centre, seeking four additional companies of CRPF to be deployed as special frontier force to control the menace.         
	Currently, the state has 30 companies of the central paramilitary force.        
	Police spokesperson and IG (provision) S.N. Pradhan said the rebels attacked the panchayat building at Shahpur village in Saraidih, 200km from the capital, in the dead of night, within hours of last nights attack on an armoured police vehicle in Chakulia, East Singhbhum.        
	The office was lying abandoned and, so, no one was injured. Two successive blasts were triggered around 1am, he said, adding that villagers heard slogans of Maoist zindabad soon after the deafening explosions that rocked the panchayat building, constructed last year at a cost of Rs 7 lakh.        
	Barring the attack in Saraidih, there was no report of any untoward incident in the state. The situation remained by and large peaceful on the second day of the bandh, the IG said.         
	Referring to todays attack in Palamau, DGP Ram said the state immediately needed an exclusive border force. We have sent a requisition for four additional companies of CRPF. The force will be deployed along the Bengal-Jharkhand border to combat Maoist menace.         
	At present, security personnel on border duty need to seek permission to cross over to Bengal. Ram said the special force, if commissioned, would have free access to both sides of the border.        
	The DGPs concern is not unwarranted. Intelligence reports reveal that Maoists from West Midnapore district have infiltrated Ghatshila, Chakulia and Dhalbhumgarh. The operation in Lalgarh has prompted them to make their presence felt in these areas and the landmine blast in Chakulias Ghoramara jungle yesterday was a clear indication of this strategy, said a source.        
	The reports also suggest that the Maoists are intending to make Chakulia the epicentre of terror tremors in Jharkhand.

	Chakulia is bang on the interstate border and it is where the infiltration efforts of Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities  a frontal organisation of CPI(Maoist)  were thwarted on June 5.        
	East Singhbhum superintendent of police Naveen Kumar Singh shared Rams concern. He said feedback from villagers in Chakulia during a combing operation that followed the landmine blast suggested heavy rebel influx in the region. We need to take concrete measures to flush out Maoists, Singh said, adding that local help was taken to plant the mine.        
	Meanwhile, life remained paralysed in both East Singhbhum and Seraikela-Kharsawan. Business establishments, factories, banks, government offices and educational institutions remained closed for the second consecutive day while NH-33 wore a deserted look.        
	Transport services were also hit in Gumla, Simdega, Latehar, Palamau, Garhwa, Lohardaga, Chatra and Khunti  all rebel strongholds.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Nehrus bust in London dislodged
                                                                                                           Nehrus bust in London dislodged
          AMIT ROY                               
	London, April 10: A bust of Jawaharlal Nehru outside the Indian High Commission building in Aldwych, London, has been dislodged from its plinth and Scotland Yard is investigating how this happened.        
	The bust is positioned to the side of India House just outside the visa section in a narrow passageway between the Strand and Aldwych known as India Place.        
	Police were made aware of damage to the statue at 3am on April 9.         
	Officer from Belgravia attended but so far no arrests have been made, a spokesperson from Scotland Yard told The Telegraph.        
	The bust is with us, said an Indian High Commission official. A statement from the High Commission said: There is a bust of Pandit Nehru at India Place, which belongs to the City Council of Westminster, which was unveiled in the 1990s. The bust of Pandit Nehru has been separated from the pedestal on which it was placed sometime during the night of 8-9th April, 2009. Immediately on noticing that the bust has been separated from the pedestal, officials in India House contacted the local police who are investigating the matter. The results of their investigation are awaited.         
	Police will not draw any conclusions until CCTV footage of the area has been studied, assuming, of course, the cameras were switched on and working. What many will find extraordinary is that India House does not appear to be under armed guard round the clock. Some reports suggested that Tamil protestors might be to blame.        
	However, the Tamil demonstrations in London, which had been held to draw attention to the plight of civilians trapped in the war zone back in Sri Lanka, had finished on April 7 and taken place mainly outside the Palace of Westminster.         
	On the same day, Sikhs all over the world were reminded of what had happened in 1984 by the shoe throwing incident involving the home minister P. Chidambaram in Delhi.         
	Given the time of night  3am  the bust could have been dislodged by a random drunk but, on balance, this seems unlikely. It was done most probably by a person or persons with some knowledge of the historical significance of Nehru.

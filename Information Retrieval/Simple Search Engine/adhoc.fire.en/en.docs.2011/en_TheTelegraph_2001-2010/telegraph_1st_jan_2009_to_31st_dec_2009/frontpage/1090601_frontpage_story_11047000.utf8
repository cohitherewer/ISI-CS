The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Tiger chiefs father in welfare camp
                                                                                                           Tiger chiefs father in welfare camp

	Colombo, May 31 (PTI): Slain Tamil Tiger boss Velupillai Prabhakarans mild-mannered father never supported the militant ways of his son and had even stopped talking with him for years.        
	A media report yesterday revealed Veerasamy Thiruvengadam Velupillais disapproval of his sons chosen path after the 76-year-old was found in a newly set up welfare camp in Vavuniya, in Northern Province.        
	With him were his wife Parvathi, the LTTE chiefs 71-year-old mother, and relatives of other Tiger leaders. All of them were in good health with no sign of injury being caused at any time.        
	In capital Colombo, the Sri Lankan government today rubbished as a figment of imagination reports that 20,000 civilians had been killed in the final phase of the military operation against the LTTE and rejected demands for a probe into human rights violations.        
	It is a figment of imagination of the people who do not have the magnanimity to acknowledge that Sri Lanka has eliminated the terrorist group on its own, foreign secretary Palitha Kohona said. The question of probe does not arise.        
	Amnesty International had yesterday called for an independent probe after reports in a British newspaper citing confidential UN reports that said over 20,000 civilians were killed in shelling by the army.        
	Britain, France and Norway have also demanded investigations into rights violations.        
	The report on Prabhakarans father said he was a mild-mannered gentleman, respected and well liked. People of Valvettithurai (a coastal town in Jaffna district where Prabhakaran came from) used to say that even the grass wouldnt get crushed when Velupillai treads on it, the Daily Mirror said.        
	In fact the father disapproved of the sons path and was not on speaking terms with Prabhakaran for years and years.        
	The report said Prabhakaran, the youngest among four siblings, was a puritan in many ways. He neither drank nor smoked and even advocated sexual abstinence for all in the early days of the movement.         
	Intelligence chief        
	Unable to retrieve the body of LTTE intelligence chief Pottu Amman from the war zone, the Sri Lankan Army is still investigating the possibility that he may be alive, the state-run Sunday Observer said.

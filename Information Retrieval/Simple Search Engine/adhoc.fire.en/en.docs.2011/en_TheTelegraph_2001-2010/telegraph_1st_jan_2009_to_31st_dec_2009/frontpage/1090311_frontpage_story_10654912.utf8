          KATE DEVLIN                            Pressure pain                                  
	London, March 10: Hot weather can trigger migraines and other debilitating types of head pain, a new study suggests.        
	Researchers have also found that changes in air pressure can increase the chance of developing a painful headache. Many migraine sufferers find that their pain can be triggered by changes in the weather, but previously there was little scientific evidence that that was the case.        
	The study looked at 7,054 patients who went to their hospitals casualty department complaining of severe head pain over a period of seven years.        
	The researchers, from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre in Boston, studied whether there was any link between the pain they felt and weather conditions over the previous three days.        
	They found a rise in temperature of 5 degrees Celsius from the previous day increased the chance of a severe headache within 24 hours by 7.5 per cent, according to the findings, published in the journal Neurology.        
	There was also a more modest increase in the risk of suffering head pain within 72 hours if air pressure fell.        
	Dr Andrew Dowson, from of Migraine Action, said that the study would come as little surprise to many migraine sufferers and confirm their personal observations.        
	Professor Peter Goadsby, from the Institute of Neurology, London, and the University of California, in San Francisco, said that the study was interesting.

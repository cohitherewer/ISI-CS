                                                                                                           Blast by Bodo rebels kills colonel
  - Army suspects revenge killing, seniormost officer to be targeted in recent times          A STAFF REPORTER                                           
	Guwahati, July 13: An army colonel and his driver were killed in a suspected revenge strike by Bodo militants who blew up their vehicle in Sonitpur district of Assam today.         
	Col S.M. Perumal is the seniormost officer to be killed since August 1997 when a brigadier was gunned down here, army sources said. Todays blast came amidst apprehension of strikes by the National Democratic Front of Boroland to avenge the recent killings of its cadres. According to official figures, 43 NDFB militants have been killed between March 1 and June 30.         
	The militants triggered the blast on a portion of the highway passing through Chariduwar reserve forest at 11 Mile under Rangapara police station at 5.30am.         
	The site is 55km from Tezpur, the headquarters of the armys 4 Corps, from where the two-vehicle convoy started this morning for Tenga, the headquarters of 5 Mountain Division in Arunachal Pradesh. The site is about 10km from the Assam-Arunachal Pradesh border and 80km from Tenga.         
	The second vehicle, a Sumo ambulance, had five army personnel. The Gypsy, carrying the colonel and his driver, naik Ashwini Kumar, was just ahead of it.         
	The blast was so powerful that it flung the Maruti Gypsy in which Col Perumal and his driver were travelling to a distance of about 20 metres from the road. The engine was wrenched off the chassis and the vehicle reduced to a mangled mass of iron and steel. It left a crater measuring two meters in diameter and about four feet in depth in the middle of the highway.        
	Defence spokesman Rajesh Kalia said the blast was triggered from about 30 metres away from near a bush. Flexible wires and 12 batteries were recovered from the spot.         
	The two vehicles were moving slowly since that particular stretch of the road was being repaired. Boulders and sand were piled up by the wayside.        
	Confirming the incident, government spokesman and minister Rockybul Hussain said, The government will go all out against the NDFB. We have instructed the district police chief to leave no stone unturned to bring the culprits to book.         
	According to the army spokesman, The militants took full advantage of the situation and planted the bomb right in the middle of the road without creating any suspicion as signs of digging were not visible.         
	While the 52-year-old commanding officer of the Tenga-based Field Medical Unit and his driver died on the spot, the ambulance was left unaffected. Even the red cross on the vehicle did not deter the militants from carrying out the strike.        
	Col Perumal, who belongs to the Army Medical Corps and is from Secunderabad in Andhra Pradesh, is survived by his wife and two children. Naik Ashwini Kumar hailed from Bahadurgarh in Haryanas Rohtak district. Their bodies will be sent to their respective homes tomorrow.         
	Sources said a public bus belonging to the Arunachal Pradesh government had crossed that portion of the road just a few minutes before the two army vehicles. There is a rush of army vehicles on this road carrying troops to and from Arunachal Pradesh where there is heavy deployment of armed personnel to guard the Sino-Indian border.         
	A police official said Assam Rifles personnel regularly patrol the highway and the militants probably mistook the medical convoy of the army for a patrol party of the paramilitary force, which has been involved in the recent operations against the NDFB in Sonitpur district.        
	The militants were lying in ambush and executed the blast to perfection, he added.         
	The police said the family members of one Jibon Basumatary, whose house is located in the vicinity of the blast site, have been picked up along with several other persons in the area.         
	There are a few scattered houses, belonging mostly to Bodos and tribals from Arunachal Pradesh, along the stretch of the highway. The sources said the inhabitants of these huts fled soon after the blast, fearing harassment from security forces.         
	On August 8, 1997, Brig. Bisa Khan of Military Engineering Services and another junior officer were shot dead by two motorcycle-borne Ulfa militants when they came out of a dental clinic on GS Road in Christian Basti.        
	Two officers of the rank of lieutenant colonels were killed in April 1996 and March 1997 at the Kamakhya and Mahabhairab temples in Guwahati and Tezpur by suspected Ulfa militants.

  Car to hit the road in July, wait for those who miss first lakh 
          OUR BUREAU                                           
	Mumbai, March 23: Good afternoon, Mamata Banerjee. The Nano will hit the road in July.        
	Six years after Ratan Tata conceived the plans for the worlds cheapest car and 14 months after he unveiled it at the Delhi Auto Expo, Tata Motors today formally announced the commercial launch of the Nano  the new runabout that has grabbed attention by challenging conventional wisdom on carmaking.        
	The Nano has come through a baptism by fire after a tumultuous phase last year when the company was forced to abandon the Singur plant in Bengal.        
	My only statement to Mamata Banerjee will be good afternoon, Tata told a news conference, asked if he had a message for her. When a similar question was popped at a meeting with editors earlier, Tata said he didnt wish to comment with elections round the corner.                        Tata, Mamata      
	In Calcutta, asked if she regretted that the Nano was being launched outside Bengal, Mamata said: I am not bothered whether Nano or Nono is launched or not. I am more concerned about farmers. I was not responsible for the closure of the Nano project here but the CPM which had used bullets to grab multi-crop land from farmers.        
	The CPM made it clear it wouldnt let go of the Nano politics when elections are round the corner. Bengal industry minister Nirupam Sen termed it an unfortunate day for Bengal.                    
	For Tata, it was a milestone moment. I am very excited today, Tata told the editors at the luncheon interaction, brushing aside a suggestion that it might have been a huge ego trip. No, its not an ego trip at all. I had no idea it (the Nano) would attract the kind of attention it eventually got.         
	The bookings for the Nano will begin on April 9. Tata said the first 100,000 Nano owners would be randomly picked through a computer program and they would receive price protection. No carmaker anywhere in the world will commit a price to a volume, which is what we are doing, Tata said.        
	The ex-showroom price of the standard model (which meets Euro III emission standards) has been fixed at Rs 1,23,360 in Delhi and Rs 1,34,250 in Mumbai. The on-road price will be higher by Rs 23,000 to Rs 25,000 as it will include the cost of insurance and registration. The ex-showroom prices for Calcutta will be announced later.        
	The Nano will initially roll out of the Pantnagar plant in Uttaranchal. The new plant at Sanand in Gujarat will come up by the end of this year or in early 2010, Tata said. The Sanand plant will have a capacity to produce 350,000 cars a year and is expandable to 500,000 units a year.        
	Analysts said the Tatas could raise 10 lakh bookings next month since they have tied up with 15 financiers. This is a plausible figure since the bookings will open across 1,000 cities and towns  and the financiers need to find just 1,000 customers per city to achieve that target.        
	 But the flipside is that customers who dont make the first cut when the first 1 lakh allottees are picked by June 25 will be in for a long wait.        
	The Pantnagar plant will produce only 4,000 cars a month. Sanand will produce about 30,000 cars a month in the first phase. If it starts production by January next year, the Tatas will be able to deliver about 2.5 lakh cars by June 2010 from the two plants.        
	The Tatas have no plans yet to give up the land at Singur. The factory sheds are still in place over there. We havent decided what to do with them, Tata said.

  - Report on primary education seeks curriculum reform          OUR BUREAU                                                 
	Calcutta, Dec. 18: Curriculum reform and removal of class barriers in primary education are the two major tools that can improve Bengals record, a trust set up by Nobel laureate Amartya Sen has said.        
	In its second report on primary education, Pratichi says: There is, first, a particular need to recognise the fierce urgency of curricular reform at the primary level         
	The importance of recognising explicitly the role of class barriers in educational underachievement  a second point of focus  also stands as being in pressing need of recognition, observes the 21-page report.         
	Sen, who will formally release the report tomorrow, said: First, we have to recognise that such problems exist. We cant offer any formula solution. The policy makers will have to take cognisance of the fact that such barriers do exist.         
	Under the guidance of Sen, the report has been prepared on the basis of the findings of a survey conducted in randomly selected 36 schools in six districts  Birbhum, Purulia, West Midnapore, Burdwan, Murshidabad and Darjeeling. Over 400 parents and representatives of teachers unions were consulted.         
	Researchers from Pratichi had visited the same schools in 2001-02 during the preparation of its first report.         
	The latest report  The Pratichi Education Report II, Primary Education in West Bengal: Changes and Challenges, with an introduction by Amartya Sen  is a comparative assessment of the situation today vis--vis the findings of 2001-02.         
	Although the report has identified several lacunae in the primary education system, it has also recorded significant improvements in the performance as well as coverage of primary education since the first report.         
	It reminds policy makers that there still remain defects and infelicities that must be overcome. The report notes that dependence on private tuition has grown over the last seven years.         
	Unlike the first report, where a set of recommendations was offered to achieve the objective of enhancement of primary education, the second report has focused extensively on the content of official curriculum and class barriers that divide the school-age population.         
	The report highlights how these two factors have contributed to underachievement by disadvantaged sections like the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Muslims.         
	M.K.A. Siddiqui, a researcher on Muslims, echoed the findings, adding that the condition of Muslim children was equally bad even in Calcutta.         
	In one of my surveys in the Rajabazar slums, I found that only 4 per cent of Muslim children of schoolgoing age were actually going to school, said Siddiqui.         
	The report presses for curriculum reform in the light of the observation that dependence on private tuition has a connection with the heavy load the children have to bear in pursuit of elementary education.        
	Sen said: We have to start the process of bringing about a change. The problem of excess load for kids in primary level is a pan-India phenomenon.         
	The message is to do away with homework, which force children to study after school hours and seek the help of private tutors.        
	Private tuition divides the student population into haves and have-nots. It makes teachers less responsible and it diminishes their central role in education, the report says.         
	Curriculum reform will also help reduce the class barriers. The report recommends greater facilities for schools or Sishu Shiksha Kendras with higher proportions of class-disadvantaged children.         
	School education minister Partha De said he was trying to find out how homework could be banished at the elementary level.

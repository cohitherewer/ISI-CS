The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Obama snarls at fat cats
                                                                                                           Obama snarls at fat cats
          SHERYL GAY STOLBERG AND STEPHEN LABATON                             Obama                                  
	Washington, Jan. 30: President Barack Obama has branded Wall Street bankers shameful for giving themselves nearly $20 billion in bonuses as the economy was deteriorating and the government was spending billions to bail out prominent financial institutions.         
	There will be time for them to make profits, and there will be time for them to get bonuses, Obama said during an appearance in the Oval Office with treasury secretary Timothy F. Geithner. Nows not that time. And thats a message that I intend to send directly to them, I expect secretary Geithner to send to them.         
	It was a pointed  if calculated  flash of anger from the President, who frequently railed against excesses in executive compensation on the campaign trail.         
	This week alone, American companies reported as many as 65,000 job cuts, and public anger is rising over reports of profligate spending by banks and investment firms that are receiving help from a bailout fund.         
	Obama was reacting to a report by the New York State comptroller that found financial executives had received an estimated $18.4 billion in bonuses for 2008, less than for the previous several years but the same level of bonuses as they received in 2004, when times were flush.         
	That is the height of irresponsibility, Obama said. It is shameful. And part of what were going to need is for the folks on Wall Street who are asking for help to show some restraint and show some discipline and show some sense of responsibility.         
	Some lawmakers have said they are considering so-called clawback provisions that could be invoked by the government to take back bonuses and executive pay.        
	Public outrage is already forcing some companies to rein in their lavish spending. John A. Thain, the former Merrill Lynch executive who was forced out of Bank of America, said he would reimburse Bank of America for a renovation of his office that included an $87,000 (Rs 42.4 lakh) area rug and a $35,000 (Rs 17.08 lakh) commode.         
	But it took the urging of the Obama administration to force Citigroup, which received an infusion of taxpayer funds last year, to abandon plans to buy a $50 million corporate jet. On Thursday, Obama made a reference to the jet, without naming Citigroup.

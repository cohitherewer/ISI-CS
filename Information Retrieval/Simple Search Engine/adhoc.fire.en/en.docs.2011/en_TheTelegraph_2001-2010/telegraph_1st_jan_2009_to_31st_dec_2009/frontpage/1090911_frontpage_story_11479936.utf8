The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | BJP wants Games put off
                                                                                                           BJP wants Games put off
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Ranchi, Sept. 10: The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) today demanded the 34th National Games be held only when an elected government was in office in the state.         
	The Congress is trying to delay elections in the name of holding the Games, state BJP president Raghubar Das said on a day a AICC team from New Delhi arrived in the state to study the political climate in the state and sort out internal issues within the state Congress.        
	For various reasons the Games has been postponed four times. The infrastructure is not yet ready. Yet the National Games Organising Committee (NGOC), made up primarily of Congress leaders, is aggressively campaigning to hold elections after the games, Das told The Telegraph.        
	We are in favour of holding the Games after an elected government is formed. Moreover, Governor K. Sankaranarayanan is on record saying that important jobs should be left for an elected government, he pointed out.         
	All 21 BJP legislators, besides the lone nominated member, had resigned yesterday demanding dissolution of the House and holding elections along with Maharashtra and Haryana.         
	The state BJP president said since Jharkhand had been declared drought-hit, it wouldnt be appropriate to indulge in extravaganzas with Bollywood stars, referring to plans to use filmstars for the opening ceremony.         
	Instead of holding the Games, the Governor should first order a probe into the huge embezzlement of funds allocated for creating the sports infrastructure, he demanded.         
	Originally slated for 2007, the Games have now been finally scheduled for November 21 to December 5 after as many as four postponements. Indian Olympic Association (IOA) president Suresh Kalmadi has already urged the Election Commission to schedule elections in the state after the event. The JD(U) also favoured holding the Games after the elections.         
	Installation of a popular government is more important than the Games. We want the event to take place after the elections, the state JD(U) president, Jaleshwar Mahto, said. However, the Union minister for food processing, Subodh Kant Sahay, asked the BJP to realise that the Games was linked with the prestige of the state. The BJP should wait for a month. They should rise above party politics, he added.

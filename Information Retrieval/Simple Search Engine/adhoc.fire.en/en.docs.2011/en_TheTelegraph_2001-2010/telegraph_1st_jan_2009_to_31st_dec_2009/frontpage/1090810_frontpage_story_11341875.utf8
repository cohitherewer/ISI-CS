          DAVID HARRISON                            Shakespeare                                  
	London, Aug. 9: A sarcophagus in an English parish church could solve the centuries-old literary debate over who really wrote the plays of William Shakespeare.         
	Parishioners at St Marys church in Warwick have sought permission to examine the contents of the 17th monument built by Fulke Greville, a writer and contemporary of Shakespeare who some believe is the true author of several of the Bards works.         
	The search has been prompted by a historians discovery of clues in Grevilles writings which suggest he had several manuscripts buried there, including a copy of Antony and Cleopatra.         
	A radar scan of the sarcophagus has already indicated the presence inside of three box-like shapes. The searchers believe these can contain documents and a further examination is now being proposed which they hope will finally prove the link between Greville and Shakespeare.         
	The searchers initially used ground-penetrating radar. The team now wants to use an endoscope  a tiny video camera on a long thin tube  to be inserted into the monument.        
	The work would be supervised by Professor Warwick Rodwell, consultant archaeologist to Westminster Abbey.         
	Experts said that any manuscripts inside might have disintegrated over the years but could have survived if they were, for example, in lead-lined boxes, which were common at the time.         
	The church council wants the sarcophagus to be opened because it believes that any new evidence will bring extra visitors and save the church, the foundations of which date back 900 years, from bankruptcy. However, the diocesan advisory committee and the Church Buildings Council are resisting the new search, on ethical grounds.        
	The search has been prompted by the work of historian A.W.L. Saunders. He believes there are several clues suggesting Greville, who is a distant ancestor, is responsible for writing a number of Shakespeares works.         
	Greville was an eminent dramatist and poet himself. Analysis of the biographical details of his life and the style of his known writings show a very close match to those of Shakespeare.         
	They lived in the same street, had the same acquaintances  including Christopher Marlowe and Francis Bacon  and enemies, and were members of the same literary circles. Greville said in his writing that he was the Master of Shakespeare.         
	Saunders has also analysed Grevilles work, The Life of Sidney, about his friend Philip Sidney, another prominent courtier, and found what he claimed to be clear hints that he wrote Antony and Cleopatra and that he had it and other works, including a biography of Queen Elizabeth, placed in the sarcophagus.         
	Kate McLuskie, the director of the Shakespeare Institute, said: If they did find a manuscript, that would be wonderful since we have no manuscript of any of Shakespeares plays. It would keep the Shakespeare industry going for years.

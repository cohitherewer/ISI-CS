The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Durga survives poll scrutiny
                                                                                                           Durga survives poll scrutiny
          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                                          Durga Soren		      
	Ranchi, April 6: Durga Sorens defiance against his father and party passed scrutiny today with Godda DC and returning officer rejecting Shibu Sorens petition which clarified that his son wasnt the official JMM nominee for the constituency.        
	During todays scrutiny of nomination papers, the DC, Virendra Ram, observed that the documents furnished by Durga Soren were valid and that he could contest the Godda Lok Sabha seat.        
	Durgas surprise candidature prompted his father and JMM chief Shibu Soren to fax a statement to the district authorities on Saturday claiming he had signed forms A and B for the seven official nominees of JMM and even sought action against Durga for having forged his signature.         
	The Congress, too, had complained to the poll authorities about Durgas candidature.        
	But Rams decision meant he did not accept Soren seniors claim. And now, Godda will see the two former allies contesting against each other, even though it was meant to be left for the Congress as per the seat sharing agreement with the JMM.        
	Durga will lock horns with Furkan Ansari of Congress, BJPs Nishikant Dube and Pradeep Yadav of JVM (P), among others.         
	All is not lost yet, as the last date for withdrawal of nomination was April 8. And although Durga seemed in no mood to relent, senior JMM leaders, including Hemlal Murmu, Hazi Hassan Ansari, L. Hembrom and Prasant Mandal, were with him in Godda trying to pursuade him to pull out.        
	We are trying our best to pursuade him to respect the principles of coalition politics. He should realise that no one is above the party. His father teaches us discipline. Even then, if he does not change, he will have to face disciplinary and legal action, fumed former minister and JMM central committee member Dulal Bhuiyan.         
	The last time such a move was made in the party, he said, was by Shibu Sorens former private secretary, P.N. Pandey, during the last Assembly polls. But Pandey was ultimately dismissed from JMM for violating party discipline. He (Durga) too will meet the same fate, Bhuiyan added.        
	JMMs organisation secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya also hoped things would be sorted out by April 8.

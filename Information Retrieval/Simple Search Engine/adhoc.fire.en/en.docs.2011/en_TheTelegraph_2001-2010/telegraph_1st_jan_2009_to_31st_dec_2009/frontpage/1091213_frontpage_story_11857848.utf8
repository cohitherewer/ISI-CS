                                Life imitates alter-ego                            
	London, Dec. 12: Comedian Rowan Atkinson had his very own Mr Bean moment behind the wheel when the engine in his vintage 1952 Jaguar racing car suddenly burst into flames.        
	The 54-year-old who was on his way home from a private dinner at Aspreys in Mayfair with his wife Sunetra, in London, was forced to tackle the small blaze with a fire extinguisher, much in the manner of his television alter-ego.        
	But despite his valiant efforts to get the motor going again Atkinson was forced to call in the RAC who eventually towed the vehicle away.         
	Bean and his wife could do nothing but hail a cab.         
	An eyewitness said: All the paparazzi were waiting outside Cipriani restaurant for Robert Downey Jr to come out when the engine caught on fire just down the street. Rowan lifted up the hood and tried to put out the flames with a fire extinguisher, but ended up having to call for roadside assistance.         
	A passionate collector of classic cars and high performance cars, Atkinson, recently appeared as his character Mr Bean at the Goodwood racing circuit, driving a mini, while seated on the roof. Atkinson also owns a McLaren F1, an Aston Martin DBS V8 and an Audi A8, and writes a monthly column in the classic care magazine Octane                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

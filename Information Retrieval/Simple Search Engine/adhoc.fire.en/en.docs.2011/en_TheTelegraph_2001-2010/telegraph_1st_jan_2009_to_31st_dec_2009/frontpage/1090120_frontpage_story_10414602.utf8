The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Smart phones out, for fear of moles
                                                                                                           Smart phones out, for fear of moles
  - Sleuths told to use lower-end mobiles        NISHIT DHOLABHAI                            A policewoman speaks on her mobile in Delhi                                         
	New Delhi, Jan. 19: Be mobile, but keep it simple.        
	That, the government thinks, is the best way to keep track of lurking terrorists.        
	The government recently asked intelligence officers to stick to plain vanilla-type mobiles lest moles within the security set-up use the high-end smart phones to transmit, or listen in to, vital information, sources said.        
	Officers have been barred from using data-enabled phones  those with GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) and Bluetooth services  that are vulnerable to hackers. The directive, a little over a month after the Mumbai attacks, means camera phones are also out.        
	The order came at a time US President-elect Barack Obama was bracing for life without his BlackBerry because of security concerns.        
	According to the sources, two major concerns were behind the governments move. First, there could be moles within the countrys mammoth security set-up and keeping watch on them was virtually impossible. Second, hackers could tap into the high-end, Internet-enabled cellphone of an intelligence officer.        
	Users of Bluetooth, a wireless protocol for exchange of data in limited ranges, can, for example, invade another enabled device and steal valuable information through what is called Bluejacking.        
	One does not have to wait for something to happen, said Major General V.K. Singh, an officer with intelligence agency RAW. Its always good to take precaution.        
	A peep into the virtual world of mobile telephony shows why the precaution is necessary.        
	If a high-end phone has an operating system like Symbian 6.0 installed, the phone can run software to turn it into a microphone.        
	An intelligence source explained how vital information could be sent out. Imagine a top-secret meeting discussing, say, surgical strikes on Pakistan. With the spy software, an intruder simply calls up a mole in the government. The moles phone wont ring. Yet, the phone would have been silently auto-answered, quietly leaking the minutes of the meeting with no sign on the phones display screen.        
	With GPRS-enabled mobile phones, sources said, users can send packets of data like photographs or small-sized software.        
	A cyber specialist demonstrated how easy ID spoofing was.        
	Give me any number, and I can give you a call from that number, the specialist said, demonstrating his ID-spoof skills.        
	For hackers, there is no dearth of material to hunt with.         
	A headline on one of several websites selling wares for less than a hundred dollars says it all: Developed by E-stealth for military espionage. Being sold right now for a limited time.        
	To be a cyber-highway robber, all you need to do is click and download.        
	So, best to keep it simple.

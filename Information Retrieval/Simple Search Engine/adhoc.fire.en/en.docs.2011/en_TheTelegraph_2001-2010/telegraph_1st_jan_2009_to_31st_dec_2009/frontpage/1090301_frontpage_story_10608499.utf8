          FARID HOSSAIN                              
	Dhaka, Feb. 28: The army wanted to storm the BDR headquarters immediately after news of the mutiny broke but was held back by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, a senior army officer said today.        
	There was anger and resentment (at the massacre of army officers) and the army wanted to attack the BDR headquarters immediately, Brig Gen Mahmud Hossain told a news conference.        
	But the military attack did not occur as the Prime Minister wanted a political solution. The army is a disciplined force and its members have training to control their emotions.        
	The armys separate news conference underlined the tension between Hasinas fragile government and the military. An outburst of army anger yesterday had prevented a senior minister and a ruling Awami League MP from attending a funeral prayer for slain officers.        
	Apparently under army pressure, Hasina  who has now clarified that the amnesty to the mutineers does not extend to the killers, looters and arsonists among them  has fast-tracked the rebels trial. The government said a special tribunal would try them and the guilty would be given exemplary punishment.        
	Hossain said only the maximum penalty will help ease the armys anger. He added the army had begun its own investigation into the killings, although a government probe continues.        
	Hasina, however, defended the amnesty announcement  criticised by her rival Khaleda Zia  saying it had saved the lives of hostages.        
	Masked navy divers and soldiers pulled out 10 more decomposing and mutilated bodies from mass graves inside the BDR compound today, including that of the wife of the slain BDR chief, Major General Shakil Ahmed. The count of dead officers has risen to 63, Hossain said, adding 33 officers had been rescued alive and 72 were missing.        
	A survivor, Major Munir, said he had escaped by smearing the blood of a slain colleague on his face and playing dead in a washroom after both were fired at from outside.

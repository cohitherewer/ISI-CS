	Jamshedpur/Ranchi, March 9: Maoist leader Rajesh Toppo, among those accused of the murder of JD(U) leader Ramesh Singh Munda and the massacre of Jharkhand Armed Police jawans at Rahe, was killed in an encounter early today near National Highway 33, about 50km from Jamshedpur in the Reladih forests.        
	The encounter, held around 2am, lasted for about half-an-hour after a patrol party confronted Toppo (30) and his men who were moving about suspiciously near a bus shed.         
	A 9mm pistol, 20 rounds of cartridges were found lying beside Toppo who was identified after the police found a medical prescription on him. Some empty cartridges, that of the pistol and a sophisticated Insas rifle, were also recovered from him.         
	The CPI(Maoist) leader had sustained three bullets  one in the chest, another in the waist and the third in his left hand.         
	Pravin Singh, senior superintendent of police, Ranchi, confirmed Toppos death in the encounter and said the Naxalite  considered to be the right hand man of the dreaded Naxalite Kundan Pahan  was wanted in at least a dozen cases.        
	Among the several cases on Toppo were the robbery of Rs 5.2 crore from an ICICI Bank van in Tamar, the massacre of five Jharkhand Armed Police jawans at Rahe, the killing of Munda and the murder of deputy superintendent of police Pramod Kumar in Tamar, Singh told The Telegraph.         
	In Ranchi, police spokesperson and inspector-general (provision) S.N. Pradhan said the encounter began after a Tamar police patrol party noticed a few people moving about suspiciously at a passenger shed at Reladih.        
	As soon as the police confronted them, they tried to flee. When the suspects started running away and opened fire, the police retaliated killing one of them. Later, he was identified as Rajesh Toppo, a top CPI(Maoist) leader, Pradhan said.        
	Superintendent of police (rural) Kuldeep Dwivedi said the encounter, by a five-member police team led by officer-in-charge of Tamar police station, inspector E.H. Siddiqui, lasted for about 30 minutes. The police needed around 30 rounds of intermittent firing.         
	After the encounter, we also recovered a mobile phone, purse and a kit bag. Its a big success for us but our job is far from over as Kundan Pahan is still at large, Dwivedi added.         
	Dwivedi said the police were on alert after they came to know that the rebels were moving about in small groups to take part in rally of the Nari Mukti Sangh on the occasion of International Womens Day.         
	Siddiqui said the operation as such wasnt unique or special, though the outcome certainly was. I have earlier faced several encounters and this was not unique for us. When the encounter started, we were at the same level as the rebels. But, when they started running, we were able to gain height in the hilly terrain and were at an advantageous position, he said.        
	He said the rebels fired more than 100 rounds, but the police remained unhurt taking advantage of the higher terrain.        
	This was the second big success for the state police in two days. Yesterday, the Lohardaga police had gunned down three members of the People Liberation Front of India in an encounter.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Bully and escape scope in wall rule
                                                                                                           Bully and escape scope in wall rule
  - Consent option after notice leaves room for coercion        MEGHDEEP BHATTACHARYYA                                            
	Calcutta, March 20: Bengals election guardian has made a forceful promise to pursue each complaint of unauthorised graffiti on private walls but the rules leave room for coercion and escape by political parties.         
	According to the rules, a showcaused suspect can be let off the hook if the consent form is furnished within 72 hours of receiving the notice.        
	The getaway option is certain to induce the parties to armtwist house owners and squeeze out a pre-dated consent to show that it was obtained three days before the paint job as mandated.         
	The Telegraph had reported on Wednesday how a businessman in Tollygunge had to grin and sign on the dotted line six days after the wall of his house was defaced.        
	After the returning officer issues a showcause notice to the party for a particular violation, if the party can come up with the letter of permission within three days, that case is closed unless there is a further complaint, chief electoral officer Debashis Sen told The Telegraph this evening in response to a question.        
	However, in case of a further complaint of fraud, the person loses a key protection  the option to remain anonymous as in the case of the alert on the initial wall defacement.         
	In case of further complaint, an anonymous complaint wont do, it has to be up front. If there is a further complaint, the case will be reopened and investigated for the authenticity of the permission and whether it was post-facto. If the wall is cleaned up in the absence of a permission, then the case is closed for good, Sen added.        
	One might interpret it as a case of condoning the violation but you have to understand that our role is like that of a strict teacher who should be obeyed by his student. When the student falters, the teacher will reprimand him, yet will give him a chance to rectify before a punishment is meted out.         
	But Sen staked it upon himself to see to it that each complaint is taken up. I promise you, there will be action and each complaint would be looked into.         
	 Please send an SMS, preferably, since its a recorded message, or call us. If no action is taken within a reasonable time, say a week, please send an email to santanujanyahoo.com (Santanu Basu, the officer on special duty, CEOs office), mentioning Defacement in the subject line, Sen said. The rule is very straight  no graffiti on public walls, and graffiti on private walls only with prior written permission.         
	Sen explained in detail the three-day window for submitting the consent forms. Some parties have been interpreting the rule  consent forms should be filed three days before the paint job or three days from getting permission, whichever is earlier  to suit their convenience and filing the permission after the offence comes to light.        
	Prior permission must be taken. There can be no relaxation on that front. However, some times the physical delivery of the letter could get delayed for a variety of reasons. For instance, in a place where the police station is really far off. That is why a certain amount of relaxation is given and hence the three-day window. Under any circumstance whatsoever, post-facto permission is not allowed. The permission must be taken before the defacement begins, he said.        
	The statement makes it clear that permission secured after a wall has been painted is invalid.        
	He also addressed an issue related to tenants who make up a large number in Calcutta. Under the stated rules, only owners can give consent.        
	For Calcutta, the commission will consider the cases where legal possessors and legal tenants  for instance, those with telephone or electricity bills in their name from that address  have given voluntary permission. However, express legal complications, like where a tenant or possessor is not allowed by the owner to give permission, will be looked into, Sen said.        
	Asked why only those who commit the offence, not those who instigate them, are being targeted, Sen said: Those at the grassroots cannot deny their responsibility. My advice to those painting graffiti is  do not get into a jam, demand to see a consent letter before you dip your brush in paint. A hired assassin may follow someone elses instructions but he has to be held guilty of the murder.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Rush to save Cong-SP deal
                                                                                                           Rush to save Cong-SP deal
          RASHEED KIDWAI                            Mulayam: Missing Amar?                                  
	New Delhi, March 5: The Congress and the Samajwadi Party have rushed to control damage, a day after prospects of an Uttar Pradesh deal receded further.        
	Samajwadi chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, left without a key negotiator in the absence of ailing general secretary Amar Singh, is said to have got in touch with Sonia Gandhi today to seek time till Saturday to reach a seat-sharing formula.        
	The move came a day after the Congress announced candidates for 24 Lok Sabha seats in the state, upping the ante in the haggle and pushing the seat talks to near-breaking point.        
	Today, however, the two sides appeared to be softening their positions. In an interim arrangement, both parties decided not to name candidates against Sonia, Rahul Gandhi, Mulayam and his son Akhilesh. The Samajwadis have been urged not to name candidates against 17 of the 24 Congress nominees named yesterday.         
	The 17 seats are part of the Samajwadis last offer to the Congress, which narrows down the tussle to seven seats.        
	Leaders of both parties are now counting on Rahul to use his influence to withdraw a couple of Congress candidates, and extract a similar concession from Mulayam. This, they said, could serve as a meeting ground.        
	Despite having gone ahead with the announcement of candidates, Congress leaders are concerned about not reaching a deal in Uttar Pradesh, which has 80 MPs.         
	If there is no deal, the Congress must search for 56 more credible candidates, after the 24 already announced. Insiders said in most constituencies, the Congress didnt have nominees who inspired confidence. But since yesterday, a few aspirants have come forward from some constituencies offering sammanjanak har (face-saving or graceful defeat), instead of promising a win.         
	Perhaps it was this hope that an alliance would still come through that stopped the Congress from convening a meeting of its screening committee to pick more candidates.        
	Congress leaders said after the July 22 trust vote last year, the party had assumed that an alliance with the Samajwadis would be stitched close to the general election. However, when the talks began formally, a war of words followed, which hobbled the pace of negotiations.        
	There is a monetary angle, too. The Congress gives Rs 25 lakh to each candidate, though some additional resources are raised through the partys informal channels. The partys managers, hoping a deal with the Samajwadis would be reached, hadnt taken into account the extra cost of funding 56 more candidates, particularly when many of them are not confident of winning.

                                Hitler (top), Owens                           
	London, Aug. 11: A veteran German sports reporter has claimed that Adolf Hitler did in fact shake hands with Black US athlete Jesse Owens at the 1936 Berlin Olympics.         
	At the time, it was reported that Hitler had stormed out of the stadium furious that Owens, who had just run his way to the first of four gold medals in the 100 metres, had beaten his Aryan sportsmen.        
	However, Siegfried Mischner, 83, said Owens, who died in 1980, used to carry around a photograph in his wallet of Hitler shaking his hand before he left the stadium.        
	Owens, who felt the newspapers of the day reported unfairly on Hitlers attitude towards him, tried to get Mischner and his journalist colleagues to change the accepted version of history in the 1960s, the Daily Mail has reported.        
	Mischner, who was a reporter at the time, claimed Owens showed him the photograph and told him: That was one of my most beautiful moments.        
	He said: It was taken behind the honour stand and so not captured by the worlds press. But I saw it, I saw him shaking Hitlers hand.        
	The predominating opinion in post-war Germany was that Hitler had ignored Owens. We therefore decided not to report on the photo. The consensus was that Hitler had to continue to be painted in a bad light in relation to Owens.

          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                                               
	Varanasi, July 22: Slow, inexorable and all-embracing  like a moulting.        
	A little past seven this morning, the sun began to peel off its stain and the earth its sudden darkness. Everything lay cast in new light seeping through diaphanous curtains of cloud, pale yet full-bodied, like the swill of good tea. Ah!, said the elderly man who had stood chest-deep in the waters at Assi since before dawn in a loin cloth and nothing else, murmuring away. Its over.        
	Sighed relief at the uneventful passing of evil.        
	The temple doors above the ghats were cranked open, the banks became a ripple of bells and bathing, whispered prayer exploded into a collective chant of joy --- quot;Jai Ho! quot; The suns emerged and alls well with the world again. Out now, and back to business as usual --- back to the shops and offices, to temples and to banks and to kitchens and to class, back home and to all its happiness and hassles. Back to life and its many splendoured drudgery.        
	For a long while early this morning, all attention was telescoped on the rare concatenation between sun and satellite in the skies, all thats worldly seemed to hang in suspension.        
	The Gods and NASA shared honours --- or had there been a secret pact overnight? Spiritual prophecy collaborated with scientific prediction. There was opaque cloud on the horizon at dawn, but it turned to yellow translucence as the sun tore through and got torn into by the moonshadow in turn. It was cloudy, but only wispy-cloudy, unlike the unfortunate masking at Taregna. It would rain in Varanasi, only much later when the spectacle had passed.        
	For the time, though, nothing mattered other than the prospect of a blinded sun, and all seemed to hang by how it would bear up to its temporary obliteration --- fate, faith, the future itself. As Vishwanath Pandey, old Kashi denizen and mover-shaker of the BHU, sagely put it. Its not that anybody believed this was a life and death affair, but for all too many complex reasons, everybody stopped for a while, out of respect, for a sense of relief you may say. This was a celestial halt in proceedings, and a massive show of collective fears and faith.        
	You wouldnt guess from the throngs on the river bank that an eclipse such as this lies burdened with unalloyed infamy in Hindu myth and mind -- dark, inauspicious, portentous, evil, so evil some believe you shouldnt even cast an eye on a dear one while the shadows are at play. And yet they were out in hundreds of thousands, men, women, children, the newly-born, the dying, driven out by a desire that is all too vicarious and all too human -- a temptation to tryst with the devil, behold it first hand.        
	And yet there must be other layers to the tactile encounters between man and nature this morning. A will perhaps to look peril in the eye and see it off, an assurance to the self and an affirmation of held faith. Or then, a philosophic demonstration of not being able to size pleasure without going through a measure of pain, of securing fresh evaluation of the good through delving in a bit of evil.        
	Malavika Bose, 70, frail, widowed, arrived at the ghats pre dawn in tremors of foreboding, frenetically twirling her tulsi rosary, gasping a mantra as long as her journey here from Bhagalpur.        
	You saw her tremors and you thought the world was teetering on the brink of Judgement Day --- this was it, the eve of pralay, end of the world. Then you saw her again, after the sun was bitten no more, and you saw the light beaming off her creased forehead, her tensions stilled, a beatific smile restoring the high bones on her sunken cheeks.        
	Ah! she seemed to say. Its over.        
	And soon it began to rain.

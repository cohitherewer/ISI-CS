  - Common platform to fuel hopes        OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Kohima, March 7: The Neiphiu Rio government today suggested an interim proposal for the six-decade-old Naga political problem. The three-day Naga consultative meeting, too, ended this evening with a call for an early solution to the Naga political problem.         
	The meeting also resolved to form a Naga common platform encompassing all sections of Naga society, including the Naga Hoho, tribal hohos, the Church and civil society.         
	 Nagaland chief minister Neiphiu Rio said 11 years of talks between the Centre and the NSCN (I-M) was too long.         
	If the talks were not making any headway, both sides should opt for an interim proposal for the time being, he said.         
	According to him, the deadlock can be resolved through an interim settlement of the problem. We have to find a way out. We should go for an interim proposal, Rio added. He, however, said the interim proposal would only be a temporary settlement.         
	Rios statement assumes significance as the NSCN (I-M), led by Isak Chisi Swu and Thuingaleng Muivah, have insisted on an interim proposal to settle the problem. The outfit has already tabled its proposals before the Centre.         
	 On the common platform, Rio said no Naga tribe would be left out in the pursuit of one dream, one future.         
	He said a collective voice was needed to take the peace process forward and the common platform would insist that the Centre and the Naga militants find an early solution to the problem.         
	 Rio, however, said the solution should be practical and honourable so that it could be acceptable to the Naga people.         
	I have already told the Centre that 11 years of negotiations was too long.         
	According to Rio , the Centre should have sought the views and opinions of the state government and the Naga organisations if they are not in a position to take the peace process forward.         
	 He, however, said this time the Naga common platform would take the desire and aspiration of the Naga people to the Centre.         
	The resolution also appealed to the Naga factions to immediately stop fratricidal killings and declare a ceasefire among themselves.         
	It reiterated that they work for the recognition of the Nagas in Myanmar and redressal of their grievances. It will urge Myanmar to ensure the economic development of the Naga-inhabited areas there.        
	Sources said Naga factions which had deliberations with overseas Nagas, Naga organisations, tribal hohos and state officials had expressed their desire to end fratricidal killings in Nagaland and pursue a non-violent solution for the over six-decades-old Naga political problem with the Centre.         
	The militant groups were also of the view that for any honourable solution to the Naga imbroglio, first of all the Naga factions must unite and speak in one voice.        
	The emissary to the collective leadership of the NSCN (I-M), V.S. Atem, yesterday said at the meeting that a certain level of anxiety had been created as the Indo-Naga political peace process had nothing worthwhile to show for 11 years of talks.

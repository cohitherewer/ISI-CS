The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Innocence proved, Omar stays at helm
                                                                                                           Innocence proved, Omar stays at helm
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                             Omar                                  
	Srinagar, July 30: Omar Abdullah today got the stamp of legitimacy to lead the Jammu and Kashmir government when governor N.N. Vohra t said there was no basis for him to resign.         
	Omar said he stands vindicated. If I would have moved heavens, the Opposition would not have been convinced about my innocence. The governors letter has proven my innocence. I am happy and thank the Almighty, he said.         
	As Omar had tendered a conditional resignation that it should be accepted if the allegation is substantiated, its rejection means he can continue as chief minister without having to formally withdraw the letter.        
	The state had plunged into a crisis on Tuesday after PDP member and former deputy chief minister Muzaffar Hussian Beigh presented a list of suspects in the infamous Srinagar sex scandal in J amp;K Assembly, saying Omars name figured at serial number 102.         
	Omar subsequently tendered a conditional resignation before the governor and asked him to accept it if he was satisfied that the allegations levelled against him were true.         
	Although Omar was asked to continue as chief minister, he skipped both the Assembly and his office over next few days and was waiting for the governors response.         
	Vohra today advised him to most vigorously devote himself to discharging responsibilities of chief minister, an official spokesman said.         
	In his response to Omars resignation, the governor has told him that based on the information supplied to him by the Union home ministry, there is no basis for him to resign.         
	The spokesperson said the governor had the matter inquired into through the Union home affairs ministry.                          
	The governors clean chit came a day after CBI cleared Omars name in sex scandal through a communication to the secretary of the Legislative Assembly, Mohammad Ramzan.         
	Omar said he expected the principal opposition party PDP to focus on development and restrain from raising frivolous charges.                     
	But he appeared unwilling to end the matter here.         
	As far as the privilege motion against Baig (PDP leader who levelled allegations against him), it is a matter between him and Speaker on which I would not like to comment, he said, indicating his government is going ahead with the move. Twelve NC and Congress legislators had on Wednesday moved a privilege motion against Baig.         
	The Assembly, which is in session at Srinagar, was adjourned until Monday after repeated clashes between the legislators from two camps.         
	PDP president Mehbooba Mufti regretted the governors move.         
	We salute governor that what CBI, police and courts could not do in years, he did it in 24 or 48 hours, Mehbooba said.

  Math favours Mamata but Marxists bank on glorious imponderables          ASHIS CHAKRABARTI                                                     
	Last days of the Red raj? It never seemed so possible as in these elections. And seemingly for good reasons. There have been calls for paribartan in other elections; it never rang so true as this time.        
	This is confirmed by the big picture of the current state of Bengal politics. Never before in its 32-year reign in Bengal has the Left been so shaken and so much of its traditional political and social bases so alienated from it.         
	Look around the length and breadth of the state and you see large chunks of the CPMs support base dropping off. The Singur-Nandigram confrontation has alienated large sections of the rural poor from the Left.        
	Between the land question and the Sachar Committee report, much of the Muslim vote too seems to have moved over to the anti-Left camp. Muslims and backward classes together make the largest voting bloc in Bengal and it has long been the CPMs monopoly.        
	Add to this the unrest among the tribal people  in Bankura, Purulia and in north Bengal  and you have a fair idea of the coming collapse of the CPM. The Lefts only gain in a social constituency could be among the urban middle classes that saw great hope for Bengal in the advent of new industries. Call it the Nano Effect.         
	On the ruins of this collapsed house, says the big-picture logic, will emerge a new order represented by the Congress-Trinamul Congress alliance.         
	If you needed proof in numbers, it is there in the last elections Bengal had  the panchayat polls of 2008, that came on the crest of the Singur-Nandigram wave and when the combined Opposition vote was higher than the Lefts in 20 out of 42 Lok Sabha constituencies.         
	Even before the Singur-Nandigram phase of Bengal politics, the combined Opposition vote in the 2006 elections fits the big political argument for change. Add up the votes the Congress, Trinamul and the SUCI got in 2006, the Opposition would be ahead of the Left in 116 Assembly seats. Divide the number by seven, the average number of Assembly segments under a Lok Sabha constituency, it is 16 for the Opposition. By all accounts, the Oppositions gains since 2006 should logically give it some more seats in these elections.        
	So its curtains for the CPM, says the big-picture school of thought.         
	But is it really?                 
	A critique of the big-picture theory throws up different scenes. The first problem with the theory, its critics say, is that it assumes a kind of homogeneity in political behaviour and voting patterns across Bengal that simply isnt there. An extreme form of this argument is that its not one election, but 42 different elections.         
	The big-picture theory works when theres an overriding issue, says social scientist Ashis Nandy. Theres no such issue at the national level this time. Singur-Nandigram is an issue in Bengal but one isnt sure if its an overriding one.         
	Even if it is, Nandy would weigh its effect against other important factors such as the CPMs organisation, the political and social bases the party has created over three decades and the effective strength of the Congress-Trinamul alliance on the ground. And the biggest challenge for election forecasts is to translate vote shares into seats, he adds.         
	This critique does not find last years panchayat elections a very reliable indicator of the possible outcome of the Lok Sabha polls. It is statistically wrong, according to it, to compare two different kinds of elections. Its like comparing oranges with apples.        
	Also, the deep disunity among Left Front partners in the rural polls was all too evident in the results. How much of that disunity has been repaired this time can make a big difference. Its wrong, the second school of debate says, to also take the combined vote of the Congress and Trinamul in the 2006 Assembly polls because Trinamuls vote in that election included that of the BJP, which is fighting separately this time.        
	Even the trend about the erosion in the Lefts votebank among Muslims is contradicted in many places. Take Jangipur, Pranab Mukherjees constituency, for example. Contrary to the trend in south Bengal, the Left scored major victories in all three tiers of panchayats in 2006 and even wrested the zilla parishad from the Congress. Murshidabad, which has the highest Muslim population for any district in Bengal, was obviously not swayed by the Singur-Nandigram wave.        
	If you think Murshidabad is too far away from Singur or Nandigram to catch the fever, heres another curious find closer home. A STAR Ananda-GFK Mode survey in April found that 68.5 per cent of Muslim voters in Calcutta North preferred the CPMs Mohammad Salim to Trinamuls Sudip Bandyopadhyay. And this is on the home turf of the Rizwanur Rahman controversy, which is generally believed to have alienated Muslims of the area from the CPM.         
	All these small pictures mean little if theres a wave, votaries of the big picture argue. They cite the anti-Indira Gandhi wave of 1977. But there are two problems with this wave theory. First, there are conflicting accounts of how to know if theres a wave. Second, the example of 1977 does not explain why the anti-Indira wave didnt reach south of the Vindhyas. In Bengal, you have to take into account the fact that any anti-CPM wave has to hit the rock of the partys organisational might.        
	So, if this election, according to one school, is going to be the CPMs Waterloo, another sees it as a possible Austerlitz (Napoleons biggest triumph) for the party.        
	This charm of unpredictability makes poll punditry for Bengal a more engaging task this time than in previous elections. The jury, therefore, is still out on wholl catch the Saturday night fever and wholl catch cold.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Balloon hoax blows up
                                                                                                           Balloon hoax blows up
                                Falcon Heene                            
	Denver, Oct. 18: (Agencies): The bizarre flight of a home-made helium balloon thought to have a six-year-old boy aboard was a hoax and publicity stunt, a Colorado sheriff said today.        
	Sheriff Jim Alderden said the boys parents, Richard and Mayumi Heene, put on a very good show for us, and we bought it.        
	We believe that we have evidence at this point to indicate that it was a publicity stunt done with the hopes of marketing themselves or better marketing themselves for a reality television show at some point in the future, Alderden said.        
	The sight of the flyaway balloon on live television gripped US viewers for more than two hours on Thursday as the silver flying-saucer-shaped contraption raced across the Colorado sky, tracked by National Guard helicopters before the boy, Falcon Heene, was found alive and well in his attic.        
	Questions were raised after Falcon was asked during an interview on CNN why he had stayed in hiding so long when family members and other searchers were desperately calling his name.        
	He responded: You guys (his parents) said that, um, we did this for a show.        
	Falcon got sick during two separate TV interviews when asked again why he hid.        
	The sheriff said no charges had been filed yet, and the parents were not under arrest. He said he expected to recommend charges of conspiracy, contributing to the delinquency of a minor, making a false report to authorities and attempting to influence a public servant.        
	Some of the most serious charges each carry a maximum sentence of six years in prison and a $500,000 fine.        
	Alderden said all three of the Heenes sons knew of the Thursday hoax, but were unlikely to face charges because of their ages. The oldest son is 10. One of the boys told investigators he saw his brother get into the balloons box before it was launched.        
	Alderden said Falcon might not have even been hiding in the rafters in the garage, as originally reported. For all we know, he may have been two blocks down the road playing on the swing in the city park, he said.        
	Heene, a storm chaser and inventor, and his family, have appeared on the ABC television reality show Wife Swap. Alderden said the couple met at an acting school in Hollywood.

          ROYA NIKKHAH                            Dan Brown                                  
	London, July 12: Novels by some of the worlds leading authors are being rushed into print early to avoid having to compete with the sequel to Dan Browns The Da Vinci Code.         
	Publication of new books by writers such as Nick Hornby, Sebastian Faulks and William Trevor have been brought forward to give them a chance of reaching the best-seller lists before Browns new novel hits the shelves on September 15.         
	The Lost Symbol is expected to dominate the book charts for months and is already in the number one spot on online retailer Amazons pre-order list.         
	Publishers said they had had to act fast when they heard of the publication date for The Lost Symbol.         
	A senior executive at Penguin, which is publishing Trevors new novel Love and Summer on August 27 and Hornbys new book, Juliet Naked, on September 3, said: When we heard that Dan Browns book was due out on September 15 there was a fair bit of reshuffling.         
	Williams book was originally down for release in early September, and Nicks book was initially due for publication at the end of September, but if youre fighting for the dearth of space on supermarket shelves and on best-seller lists when Brown is out, youve clearly got no chance of getting a book to number one, so we decided to go early. It has very much been a case of dominoes falling around Dan Brown.         
	Faulkss new book, A Week in December, was originally scheduled for early 2010, but will now also be published early, on September 3.         
	The Da Vinci Code spent more than two years in the top 10 best-seller lists in the UK. It has sold more than 81 million copies worldwide. The book and its predecessors, Deception Point, Angels amp; Demons and Digital Fortress are the first, second, third and fourth best-selling adult paperback novels in British history.

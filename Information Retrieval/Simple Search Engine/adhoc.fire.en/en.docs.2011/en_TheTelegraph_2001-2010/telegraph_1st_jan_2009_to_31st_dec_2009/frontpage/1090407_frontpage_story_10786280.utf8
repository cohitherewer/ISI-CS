The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Ammo deal with Israel 
                                                                                                           Ammo deal with Israel 
          SUJAN DUTTA                            A Bofors gun                                  
	New Delhi, April 6: India has signed a Rs 2000-crore election-eve deal with Israel to revive a junked ordnance factory to produce ammunition for the armys Bofors guns in the peace abode of Nalanda in Bihar.        
	The deal was signed in the last week of March even as the defence establishment was confronted with charges that it had paid commissions to agents in a Rs 10,000-crore project to jointly produce surface-to-air missiles with Israel Aerospace Industries in an agreement signed in February that has been questioned by Opposition parties.        
	The Rs 2,000-crore deal was signed between the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) and the Israel Military Industries, a source in the defence ministry said today. The Nalanda factory was originally proposed at the time of the BJP-led NDA regime when George Fernandes was the defence minister and Nalanda was his constituency.        
	In 2006, the defence ministry had decided to junk the proposal because Denel, the South African firm that was to partner the OFB in the project, was blacklisted in another deal. By then, the government had already spent more than Rs 300 crore on the project, then estimated to cost around Rs 1,400 crore.        
	The Nalanda project had also run into trouble from environment activists because it was perceived a threat to the Shanti Stupa in the Buddhist pilgrimage centre.        
	An expert committee was set up in 2007 to study if the project could be revived. It recommended changes and proposed international participation. A global tender was floated. The Cabinet Committee on Security approved the Israeli proposal in January this year, the source said.        
	The deal was signed in the fourth week of March, also the last leg of the financial year 2008-2009, after the elections were announced.        
	The project will take three years to produce bimodular charges for artillery rounds for the 155mm guns for the Indian Armys heavy guns. These are the Bofors guns the army inducted in 1986-1987, which ran into controversy on charges of payment of Rs 64 crore as commissions to middlemen in the deal.        
	The ammunition will also feed 130mm artillery that have been or are being upgraded to 155mm by Israeli firm Soltam.        
	The Indian Army is running short of ammunition for these heavy guns. Bimodular charges are basically propellants for the bombs that the heavy guns fire. The ammunition has a shelf life and has to be destroyed unless used.        
	With a ceasefire on along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir since 2003, the heavy guns have fallen by and large silent and much of the ammunition is unused and has expired.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Babies get a taste of Fed Express
                                                                                                           Babies get a taste of Fed Express
  - Less than three weeks old, Federer twins take off on a big trip          CHRISTOPHER CLAREY                             Federers twin daughters                                        
	Feusisberg (Switzerland), Aug. 8: A few hours before the Federers first flight as a family, the new father, Roger, was sounding surprisingly relaxed.        
	He sat on a terrace with a panoramic view of Lake Zurich and talked about crossing a much more imposing body of water  the Atlantic  with his wife, Mirka, and their identical twins, Charlene and Myla.        
	The girls were born on July 23 in Zurich; they were checked out of the hospital on Tuesday. They already have travelling papers, and the first international stop of their very young, presumably peripatetic lives will be Montreal. Federer will return to competition earlier than he expected, for the Rogers Cup, after one of the best runs of his or any tennis players life.        
	I was obviously only going to do this if everything was safe and good, Federer said on Friday morning, in his first interview since he won Wimbledon last month. Mirka went through a check yesterday. The babies have been at the hospital for 10 days, and everything is perfect. So were doing it. Big family. Big trip. On the bandwagon. Im really excited to see how were going to manage it.        
	For most of the worlds new parents, the idea of taking infant twins on a long-haul journey before they were three weeks old would not be cause for rejoicing. Not with baby carriers, economy-class seating and dread-filled seatmates to manage.         
	But Federer, for all his down-to-earth appeal, does enjoy his privileges. Although he often crosses oceans on commercial planes, he made Fridays trans-Atlantic flight in a private jet, with a baby nurse on board to help Mirka and Roger negotiate the trip and the jet-lagged nights to come.        
	Thats a big help, Federer said. But Mirka is really hands-on. Its great to have the help, but I think its all been working well since we came home for three or four days. Mirka doesnt mind getting up in the night, doesnt mind feeding the babies at whatever time, changing the nappies. For her, if she cant do it, its like shes missing out on something.        
	Federer has done his best not to miss much himself. With impeccable Swiss timing, Mirka gave birth in the fallow tennis stretch between Wimbledon, where Federer broke the record for Grand Slam singles victories, and the US Open.        
	We didnt completely just aim for a certain window, so for it to happen during this period of time, we got lucky, Federer said of the twins arrival date. Because I was scared. You know how it is. After week 25, you never know when a baby can come, so at the beginning of the French Open, I was thinking that we have to get through two Grand Slams, and Mirka has to be there. Were not in Switzerland. It could happen anytime really.        
	The Federers found out Mirka was pregnant in January, during a tournament in Doha, Qatar, and learned that she was expecting twins after a doctors appointment during the Australian Open that month. Federer said he was thrilled at the prospect, but uncertain what such news might do to his tennis game.        
	In his next match, he overwhelmed Juan Martdel Potro of Argentina, 6-3, 6-0, 6-0, in the quarterfinals. It was like, OK, seems like its not affecting me, Federer said with a laugh. That was a good start. It gave me confidence.        
	Yesterdays interview was conducted in a spa on a slope in Feusisberg, a short drive from Federers apartment on the south side of Lake Zurich. Originally from Basel, Federer moved because some of his closest friends reside in the area. He also owns a chalet near the Swiss resort town of Lenzerheide and another residence in Dubai, where he frequently trains. But Switzerland, where he typically only spends a few weeks a year, remains home.         
	Nice and quiet; drive five minutes and you have the cows, he said. I like it.         
	Federer publicly announced Mirkas pregnancy at the Indian Wells tournament in California in March. He decided, on medical advice, not to mention at first that they were expecting twins. That meant Federer continued to refer to the impending arrival of the baby through the many interviews in Paris and London. I was thinking that theyre going to be playing tricks on us like crazy, Federer said of his girls.         
	But they dont look the same at the moment. I thought right away I wouldnt be able to tell the difference, but you know, one is a bit lighter than the other one, so its not automatically the same right away. I can tell them apart very easily now, and Mirka, too.         
	Federer said he spent nearly three weeks at the hospital, sleeping in the same room with Mirka, who had checked in early; later, he was sleeping in the same room with Mirka and the twins.         
	In a burst of achievement this summer, Federer won the only major title he lacked, the French Open, and broke Pete Samprass record for Grand Slam singles titles by winning his 15th at Wimbledon.        
	Its a lot at once, Federer said. You almost want to have a longer break after that unbelievable win in Paris, so you can ride the Paris wave for so long. But then right away Wimbledon came, and I won that, too. But honestly, just today, I was in the shower thinking I havent even really thought about my Wimbledon win at all the last week.         
	Raising newborns will do that to a parent. Now comes the challenge of raising them on the road.                    NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

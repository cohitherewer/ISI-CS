          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                                        Annapurna  Devi      
	Ranchi, March 23: A day after announcing the end of its seat-sharing deal with the Congress, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) appears to have finalised candidates for the four seats it will be contesting in Jharkhand, namely Chatra, Palamau, Rajmahal, Koderma.        
	In Chatra, RJD chief Lalu Prasad is likely to deny a ticket to sitting MP Dhirendra Agrawal and field Koderma MLA Annapurna Devi to take on former Assembly Speaker Inder Singh Namdhari, who is contesting as an Independent.         
	In Rajmahal, Lalu Prasad is also trying to poach Congress MLA Thomas Hansda to contest against JMMs Hemlal Murmu. Hansda, a Congress veteran, is unhappy at having lost the seat to the JMM under the seat-sharing arrangement.        
	The RJD chief, likely to declare the nominees officially late tonight, was however banking on sitting MP Ghuran Ram to contest from Palamau. He is likely to give a ticket to Pranab Verma, son of former MP Reetlal Verma, to take on Babulal Marandi in Koderma.        
	Ram Vilas Paswans LJP, which has decided to fight five seats in alliance with the RJD, will declare nominees tomorrow.        
	 The RJD, LJPs four-to-five seat deal had its ripple effect in the UPA with the Congress and the JMM deciding to put up candidates in Palamau and Chatra where the RJD has sitting MPs.         
	Under the agreement, the Congress got Chatra while the JMM got Palamau. The Congress fielded Dheeraj Sahu, brother of former MP late Shiv Prasad Sahu, in Chatra.         
	Though the JMM was yet to declare its nominees for Koderma and Palamau, the party is wooing top Naxal leader Kameshwar Baitha, lodged in Garhwa jail, to contest from Palamau.        
	Problems continued for the NDA with a section of BJP leaders, led by Chatra MLA Satyanand Bhokta, locking up the state party headquarters today to demand the reversal of the party leaderships decision to hand over Chatra and Palamau to the JD (U).        
	 Reacting to the JD(U)s decision to field a political greenhorn and former BJP man, Arun Kumar Yadav from Chatra, BJP state president Raghuvar Das said he would request Sharad Yadav and Rajnath Singh to reconsider the decision.        
	Sonia to campaign        
	State Congress chief Pradeep Balmuchu said both Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi would be campaigning in the state. They (Sonia for two days and Rahul for one day) will be campaigning against RJD-LJP nominees. There will be no friendly fights, he said.

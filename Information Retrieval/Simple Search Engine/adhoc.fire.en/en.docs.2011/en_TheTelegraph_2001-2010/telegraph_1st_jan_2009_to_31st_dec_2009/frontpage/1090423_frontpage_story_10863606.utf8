	New Delhi, April 22: Akriti Bhatia, 17, suffered an asthma attack in school yesterday and died gasping for breath an hour later on her way to a hospital 2km away, the oxygen mask having allegedly been snatched back from her because it was school property.        
	The school  one of the capitals more expensive schools  had failed to call an ambulance or make any effort to take the Class XII student to hospital after she complained of breathlessness.         
	Modern School, Vasant Vihar, informed her parents and waited for the car to come from their Siri Fort home, a 40-minute drive, to take her to the hospital.         
	Akritis father, Vipin Bhatia, has filed an FIR accusing the school of criminal negligence. Neither was any qualified doctor requisitioned by the school authorities to tend to my daughter nor was an ambulance called for taking her to a hospital or a nursing home for urgent treatment and intervention in those 45 minutes to one hour that proved fatal, the FIR says.         
	The school principal, Goldy Malhotra, and other staff members have been named in the complaint.        
	A student who was witness, but requested not to be named, said: They didnt even have a nebuliser in school. The nurse used an oxygen mask. Then when Akritis car arrived, the nurse even snatched away the oxygen mask claiming that it was school property.        
	Akriti was forced to drink a glass of fresh lime soda and choked, the student said.        
	The school denied this.        
	A senior internal medicine specialist said patients experiencing acute symptoms of asthma should ideally not be given anything to drink during the episode  unless the patient is dehydrated and urgently needs fluid.         
	A lemon drink certainly cannot cause death, but it is best to avoid giving a drink during an acute asthma attack, said Nalin Nag, a senior consultant at the Apollo Indraprastha Hospital in New Delhi. This is to avoid the risk of fluid going into the windpipe or the lungs.         
	Principal Malhotra denied negligence. We dont agree that there was negligence on our part. We have a nurse to attend to any medical emergency. We called her parents repeatedly but her mother insisted that she should be sent to her aunts house. The school nurse insisted that the child should be taken to hospital, Malhotra said.        
	But Malhotra accepted that the school had not called an ambulance. The school did not deny either that the oxygen mask had been taken back.        
	The Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights issued a notice to the school for allegedly failing to provide timely medical aid.         
	The principal has been asked to reply within seven days.

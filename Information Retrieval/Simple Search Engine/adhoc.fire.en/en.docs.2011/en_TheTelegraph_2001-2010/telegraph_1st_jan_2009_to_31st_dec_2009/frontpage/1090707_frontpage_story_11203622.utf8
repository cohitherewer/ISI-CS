	Calcutta, July 6: Software exporters in the country have something to cheer about with the Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee proposing to extend the Software Technology Parks of India (STPI) scheme by one year.         
	Mukherjee also proposed to remove the fringe benefit tax (FBT) in his budget speech today.        
	Though companies engaged in software exports are upbeat, Mukherjees proposals have failed to boost the IT stocks on domestic bourses. IT stocks on the Bombay Stock Exchange today traded 2.74 per cent down at 3236.33 when the market closed for the day.        
	In order to battle the slowdown in exports, I propose to extend the sunset clauses for these tax holidays by one more year  financial year 2010-11, Mukherjee said in his speech today.         
	Under the STPI scheme, information technology companies dont have to pay tax on their profits from exports. The scheme was due to expire in March 2010.         
	Welcoming the extension, Nasscom president Som Mittal said though the industry had asked for a five-year break for short term, the one-year tax holiday was well-timed to combat the slowdown.         
	The extension of the tax exemption under STPI for one more year is a step in the right direction as is the abolition of FBT. The finance minister may have missed a trick by not unleashing a wide-ranging e-governance program to extract more economic efficiencies, said S. Ramadorai, CEO and managing director of the countries largest software exporter Tata Consultancy Services.        
	The countrys second largest software exporter Infosys, however, said the impact was limited as most STPs would have come out of tax holidays, but it was a good gesture by the government.         
	The budget has been an overall positive, Wipro said in a statement. The abolition of FBT has removed a major irritant, it said.         
	The statement also added that the proposal to raise the minimum alternate tax (MAT) to 15 per cent from 10 per cent of book profits wont have any material impact on Wipro, Indias third-largest software exporter by revenue. MAT is a tax imposed by the government on some companies that pay little or no tax because of various tax exemptions available to them.        
	The extension is a good move at time when the industry is facing pricing pressure and volumes are down, said Genpact CEO Pramod Bhasin. The government has also scrapped the FBT, which was mostly affecting the IT and ITeS industry. With the tax gone, the employee stock options will get attractive, he said.                                             
	The levy of FBT had caused a lot of debate and disillusion, Mittal said. FBT was introduced in the Finance Act 2005, on the value of certain fringe benefits given by the employer to their employees.         
	This tax has been perceived as imposing considerable compliance burden, Mukherjee said. Mittal said the removal of FBT would go a long way for the growth of the industry, while Infosys Gopalakrishnan said its removal was beneficial for the IT industry.         
	The government has also exempted the packaged softwares from companies such as Microsoft (Windows) and Oracle (ERP) from excise duty and CVDs, which could make the prices of these softwares cheaper and affordable for small IT firms.         
	Mittal said the prices should fall for these software products, but a lot would depend on the exact fine print of the budget announcement.         
	IDC Indias country manager Kapil Dev Singh said the budget had little for the IT industry to cheer.                                 
	Software exporters have to contend with a year at a time extension of STPI scheme, he added.        
	President and managing director of Cognizant R Chandrasekaran said extension of the sunset clause on STPI by a year would specifically benefit small and medium sized companies in the industry that needed this critical impetus for growth.        
	This is also important in this turbulant global economic environment, in the context of emerging locations such as China, the Philippines or Vietnam continuing to offer attractive tax incentives, he said.         
	CFO of iGATE Sujit Sircar said though the Finance Minister has given an extension of utilisation of MAT credit from seven to 10 years, considering the increase of the rate from 10 per cent to 15 per cent, there would be significant strain on the cash flow of IT companies.        
	Scrapping of the FBT and clarification on the service tax applicability on packaged software are positives, B. Ramaswamy, MD, Sonata Software. Said.        
	HCL Infosystem chairman and MD Ajai Chowdhury said, the excise/CVD exemption is unclear as it was not stated whether VAT is included in this or not. The Mission in Education through ICT which has been substantially increased to Rs 900 crore and the provision for setting up and up-gradation of Polytechnics under the Skill Development Mission enhanced to Rs 495 crore, he pointed out.        
	Nasscom also welcomed the government decision to set up an alternative tax dispute addressal mechanism within the Income Tax department for foreign companies, especially in the IT sector, for the resolution of transfer pricing issues.         
	This was a long-pending demand of the industry. Now, CBDT would formulate safe harbour rules for these companies, as per the proposal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | For nervous Cong, its Sonia again

	Ranchi, April 20: Congress president Sonia Gandhi is making her second campaign visit to Jharkhand tomorrow, indicating the partys growing nervousness about the moderate voter turnout and a split in the anti-BJP votes in the first phase of voting.        
	Much is at stake for the party, as it will have to defend four of its seats  Ranchi, Godda, Dhanbad and Singhbhum  during the second and last phase of voting in the state on April 23.        
	But Sonia is scheduled to be in Ranchi only, campaigning for Subodh Kant Sahay at Hatia, the siting MPs stronghold where she would probably remind voters about how she had kept her promise of reviving Heavy Engineering Corporation.         
	Ranchi happens to be the only seat where the Congress looks strong. For one, party nominee Sahay has remained in touch with its residents throughout the last five years. And two, there is little chance of a split in anti-BJP votes.        
	While bickering with the JMM  sparked by its chief Shibu Sorens son Durga  is weighing heavily on the partys poll managers in Godda, party infighting is keeping Dhanbad nominee Chandrashekhar Dubey on tenterhooks. Former chief minister Madhu Koda in Singhbhum is proving to be a tough contestant for the Congresss five-time MP, the veteran Bagun Sumbrui.        
	More than the Congress leadership, it is Sahays personal effort in nurturing his constituency that has kept Ranchi voters in his favour, said Harishwar Dayal, who is leading a team to analyse the elections on behalf of the Centre for Studying Developing Societies.        
	The JMM, too, seems to have realised that no seat can be taken for granted. Its ailing chief Soren, flew down to Dumka today, to try and pacify Durga. But failed, given that Durga rushed to Godda to campaign.        
	Soren hasnt been able to campaign because of his ill health, for which he was undergoing treatment in New Delhi. Contesting in absentia from the Jamtara Assembly and the Dumka Lok Sabha seat, the JMM was, however, confident he would sail through given his following in the Santhal Pargana.        
	Former agriculture minister and Shikaripara MLA Nalin Soren believed Soren would have won even if he hadnt come. People saw how ill he was. They will now vote for him, said the man who was among those tipped to become chief minister after Guruji lost the Tamar by-election.        
	But Soren Srs absence was being felt within the JMM. There is no doubt that Gurujis absence is being felt in the party. Our cadres are finding it difficult to convince voters about his illness. But Guruji will in any case, maintained party MLA Ravindra Nath Mahto.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Water wars and IIT churn city of lakes
                                                                                                           Water wars and IIT churn city of lakes
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI IN UDAIPUR                        The Lake Palace in the middle of Lake Pichola, large parts of which have gone dry				                                 
	Cloth trader Roopchand Jain laughed in ridicule at the suggestion, perhaps simplistic, that the city of lakes appears better placed than other regions of Rajasthan in the availability of water.         
	Kya bol rahe ho bhai. Yahi to tragedy hai (What are you saying brother thats the tragedy here), Jain said, sipping a cup of tea.         
	Some of Indias most picturesque man-made lakes dot this city and the district that shares its name, but it is water shortage that is emerging as the most contentious poll issue here, in the old capital of the Mewar kingdom.         
	To quote The Rime of the Ancient Mariner  Water, water, every where, Nor any drop to drink  would be an exaggeration, but Udaipurs famed lakes that draw visitors from across the world are drying up, reducing water supply and threatening tourism.        
	Much of the water that remains in the lakes is undrinkable, because weed and fungal plant thrive in shallow water.         
	Large sections of Lake Pichola, that in picture postcards looks a sea with islands on which old mahals have been developed into hotels, are today dry land  and the islands can be approached by road through the lakes bed.         
	Drinking water is a major issue and we are offering people the best solution, claimed senior Udaipur BJP leader Virendra Singh Solanki. The BJP holds the seat at present.         
	The party has outlined a massive plan to utilise lakes cradled by hills surrounding the city to provide water for the entire district. Gravity, Solanki said, would be used to tunnel the water into the lakes in the plains that would then feed the city and the villages.         
	The hills, too, depend on rains for water, however, and it hasnt rained in Udaipur for three years now.         
	The Congress alleges that the BJP plan is a hoax that will be exposed each time Udaipur as a region goes through a dry spell.         
	The most sustainable solution to the water problem here is to bring water from the Narmada in Gujarat. We have been working on this for some time but because of a series of polls  first to the Assembly, and now to the Lok Sabha  we have not been able to finalise a deal yet, a senior Congress leader said.         
	But if water is the citys demand for survival, this constituency in the south of Rajasthan, bordering Gujarat, is also looking to leap to the future.         
	From auto-rickshaw drivers to tea stall owners and members of the tourism industry, there is a common, and loud, demand for an Indian Institute of Technology here.         
	BJP candidate Mahaveer Bhagora, best known nationally as one of the three MPs who flashed currency notes in Parliament alleging bribery during the July 2008 trust vote, has promised an IIT here.         
	But given the insistence on Kota as the venue for Rajasthans IIT by his partys former chief minister, Vasundhara Raje Scindia, Class XI student Rajiv Mathur is unwilling to believe Bhagora.         
	When the senior BJP leaders have shown a preference for Kota, Bhagoras promise, expected on the eve of polls, means nothing to me.        
	The Congress is maintaining ambivalence on the venue for the IIT promised to the state by the UPA and now operating out of IIT Kanpur pending a final decision on its location.         
	Rajasthan deserves an IIT but beyond that, it is for the state and the Centre to decide whether it should be set up in Kota, Jodhpur, Jaipur or Udaipur, party general secretary Digvijay Singh said on a visit here.         
	In The rural parts of Udaipur district, _, many have not even heard of the term IIT. It is an issue, but only in the city, explained a BJP leader.         
	But the villages too, are springing a surprise. Elsewhere in the state, caste determines a voters choice but its is unlikely to be a factor in Udaipur this time  thanks to reservation.         
	The Udaipur seat has been reserved for Scheduled Tribes in 2009, and in village after village it is a comparison between the personal attributes of Bhagora and Congress candidate Raghuveer Singh Meena, a sitting MLA, that conversations revolve around.         
	STs apart, the district has a large population of Rajputs, Jains and traders originally from Gujarat.         
	These communities have dominated polling trends in the past, say leaders of the Congress and the BJP.         
	But this time, since the seat is reserved, polling will be based on the image of the two candidates, a Congress leader said.         
	The Congress is projecting Meena, a sitting MLA, as a simple, clean and young politician and in both the villages of the district and in Udaipur city, it appears to be succeeding.         
	The BJP alleges Meena is neither simple nor clean. He is a goonda who has in the past attacked our campaign vehicles, BJP leader Solanki said.         
	The party claims Bhagora is incorruptible and cites as proof the trust vote over the Indo-US nuclear deal. If he wanted to take money, he could have bagged crores. That he chose to expose the government shows that he is clean, Solanki argued.         
	Come Thursday, and voters will tell if they agree.        
	 Udaipur votes on May 7

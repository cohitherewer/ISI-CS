The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Feedback frenzy for honest debate
                                                                                                           Feedback frenzy for honest debate
          SANJAY K. JHA                              Rajnath Singh, Bal Apte				                                 
	New Delhi, June 29: The BJP is getting feedback from local units, national leaders and even people outside politics to set the theme for its crucial end-August chintan baithak.        
	People from various party levels are preparing the draft that will be debated at the brainstorming session, which the BJP hopes will show it a way out of its post-defeat stupor. Leaders say a loose system involving a large number of people has been preferred to a fixed committee to avoid a biased report.        
	The draft will reflect the whole gamut of the feedback we receive from the entire country, a senior leader told The Telegraph.        
	We want an honest introspection before deciding the future course of action. The party is interested neither in a cover-up nor in a blame game. We want answers to issues that went against us.        
	Although no formal committee has been formed to probe the poll defeat, party president Rajnath Singh has asked senior leader Bal Apte to oversee the process that will lead to the finalisation of the draft.        
	Sources said journalist Chandan Mitra and RSS ideologue Murlidhar Rao, a Rajnath aide, have been asked to help Apte prepare the interim draft. Party general secretaries too are preparing reports independently.        
	Central observers will visit the states, gather inputs from local units and hand in their reports to Apte. The observers have been asked to sound out independent sources, including civil society representatives, for a wider perspective on the reasons for the defeat.        
	Apte will also factor in the views expressed by senior leaders, including the controversial letters written by Jaswant Singh, Yashwant Sinha and Arun Shourie.        
	The mood at the post-defeat national executive indicated that a cover-up was not entirely possible and that party leaders wanted an open discussion. But, sources say, the party also intends to leave the blame game behind and have a constructive debate on a road map.        
	The sources, however, rule out any discussion on the nature of the relationship with the RSS and the relevance of the Hindutva ideology.        
	Advaniji has already explained at the national executive that there is no question of deviating from Hindutva and redefining ties with the RSS, a leader said.        
	Yes, certain practical matters like explicit Muslim-bashing, like the Varun episode, have to be sorted out. That requires better articulation of our position and we hope something will come out at the chintan baithak.        
	The latest issue of RSS mouthpiece Organiser claims that the ideology of Hindutva is secular and inclusive, and that the BJP may have failed to explain this clearly enough. The Sangh is expected to hold a meeting in the first week of July to discuss a road map for the BJP.

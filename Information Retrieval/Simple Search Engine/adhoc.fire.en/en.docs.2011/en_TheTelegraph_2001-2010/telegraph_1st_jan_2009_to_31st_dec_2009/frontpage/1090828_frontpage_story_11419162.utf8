                                                                                                           Assam unveils IT policy 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Guwahati, Aug. 27: NICT 2009 could not have started on a better note.         
	The Assam government today unveiled an aggressive IT policy appropriately aimed at enabling the state to reach an eminent position in the information policy sector. Dispur also declared IT an essential service.         
	Information technology and health minister Himata Biswa Sarma unveiled the policy during the inaugural function of the two-day NICT 2009, the regions biggest conclave on information and communication technology organised by The Telegraph at Vishwaratna Hotel here.         
	There could not have been a better place (than the platform of Northeast Information and Communication Technology) to announce that the Assam government is ready with the new IT policy which has come into effect, Sarma said amid applause from the packed gathering.        
	Power minister Pradyut Bordoloi emphasised the states support to the cause of IT  and the good work done by NICT  by saying, The presence of both my colleague and me here today is a signal, loud and clear, that the Assam government will do all that is needed to be done to take the benefits of information technology to the people.         
	The presence of Bordoloi was fitting as the new policy envisages the use of ASEBs high-tension power lines and subsidiary distribution network for building a statewide maze of optical fibre cable for better connectivity.         
	The power minister, who spoke before Sarma, highlighted the steps being taken by the state to use IT in the power sector to make it more people-friendly and efficient. IT is the tool which can overcome the challenges of demography and disparity, he added.         
	Picking up from Bordoloi, Sarma made a strong case for potential investors choosing Assam as their new destination. He said the new IT policy was packed with strong investment promotion clauses.         
	We are even ready to go beyond the policy if anyone comes forward with a mega project (with an investment of Rs 100 crore or more). We are ready to take up such cases for special incentives, he added.         
	The Assam government has supported the NICT in all its five editions as the partner state. Sarma said the new IT policy was finalised after extensive discussions with three top names from the IT world, S. Ramadorai of Tata Consultancy Services, N.R.Narayana Murthy of Infosys and Azim Premji of Wipro, with whom chief minister Tarun Gogoi held extensive discussions over several months.         
	We are also looking at the social issues in the IT sector and have decided to allow women to work 24 hours. This means that women will now be able to work in places like a BPO in any shift, he added.         
	The new IT policy mainly consists of a 14-point agenda which includes services such as G2G (government to government), G2B (government to business), G2C (government to citizen), ICT intervention in education sector, GIS and mapping, free and open source software and an effective anti-piracy policy.         
	Sarma said the state secretariat would become completely online within a couple of months and files would become almost non-existent.

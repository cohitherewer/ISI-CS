          STEVE LOHR                            A BlackBerry Storm                                  
	New York, June 10: In todays recession-racked economy, penny-pinching is an American pastime. But people are still opening their wallets for smartphones.         
	Sales of BlackBerrys, iPhones and other smartphone models are rising smartly and are projected to increase 25 per cent this year, according to Gartner, a research business.         
	Widely anticipated new models like the Palm Pre, which went on sale in America on Saturday, will help fuel that growth. Meanwhile, total cellphone sales are expected to fall.         
	The smartphone surge, it seems, is a case of a trading-up trend in technology that is running strong enough to weather the downturn. And as is so often true when it comes to adoption of new technology, the smartphone story is as much about consumer sociology and psychology as it is about chips, bytes and bandwidth.        
	For a growing swathe of the population, the social expectation is that one is nearly always connected and reachable almost instantly via email. The smartphone, analysts say, is the instrument of that connectedness  and thus worth the cost, both as a communications tool and as a status symbol.        
	The social norm is that you should respond within a couple of hours, if not immediately, said David E. Meyer, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan. If you dont, it is assumed you are out to lunch mentally, out of it socially, or dont like the person who sent the email.        
	The spread of those social assumptions may signal a technological crossover that echoes the proliferation of email itself more than a decade ago. At some point in the early 1990s, it became socially unacceptable  at least for many people  to not have an email address.        
	Smartphones are not cheap, particularly in tough economic times. The phones, even with routine discounts from wireless carriers, usually cost $100 to $300, while the data and calling service plans are typically $80 to $100 a month.        
	But recent smartphone converts are often people who count pennies, including many from the growing ranks of job seekers. Helene Rude of Briarcliff Manor, New York, was laid off from her job as a business development manager at IBM this year, when her unit, among others, was the target of cuts. When she left, Rude had to turn in her company notebook computer with its constant wireless connection.         
	So she got an iPhone instead, allowing her to be online no matter where she was, without having to lug a computer around. I absolutely got it for the job search, she said. I dont know if its really an expectation, but if another job candidate returns an email message eight hours later, and you get back immediately with a message that says Sent from my iPhone, I think it has to be a check box in your favour.        
	That is certainly the sort of message the wireless industry would like to reinforce. Smartphones are seen as essential to be productive in a mobile society, said David Christopher, chief marketing officer at AT amp;Ts wireless division.

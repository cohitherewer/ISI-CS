The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Lalu gets arithmetic wrong, loses poll plot

          NALIN VERMA                                              
	Patna, May 19: Lalu Prasads much-vaunted political arithmetic has gone horribly wrong.         
	An examination of the vote share released by the Election Commission shows that the usually wily RJD chief over-estimated the Lok Janshakti Party of Ram Vilas Paswan and underestimated the Congress, resulting in the most humiliating defeat of his chequered political career.        
	The RJD-LJP combine has secured 25.85 per cent of the votes against the NDAs 37.97.        
	The Congress, which contested more seats this time than in 2004 when it had a deal with the RJD-LJP, has upped its share to 10.26 per cent from 4.49. It has won two seats against three in 2004.        
	The RJD-LJP combine had handed out to the Congress treatment usually reserved for junior allies, offering it only three of the states 40 seats. An angry Congress fought on its own, jumbling up Lalu Prasads equations.         
	The RJD vote share plummeted by over 11 percentage points, from 30.67 per cent in 2004 to 19.3 this time.        
	The vote share reflects in the tally: the NDA grabbed 32 seats against the RJDs four and the Congresss two. Paswans party drew a blank.        
	Had the RJD-LJP allied with the Congress, the combine could have garnered about 15-18 seats, as they lost in constituencies where the equation worked against them.         
	Where Lalu Prasad erred was in thinking that the Muslims, thus far staunch supporters of the RJD chief, would stick with him. Lalu Prasad reasoned that the moribund Congress wouldnt be able to cut into the minority votes.         
	But a sizeable chunk of Muslims backed the Congress, leaving Lalu Prasad with only his committed Yadav votebank and a section of the other backward classes.         
	The JD-U weaned over the Pasmanda Muslims, those from the extremely backward classes. Also, the RJD lost the Brahmin votes it had got last time because of the Congress alliance.         
	The exodus of Muslims from the RJD is evident from the Kishenganj result. Congress nominee Asrarul Haque wrested the Muslim majority seat from the RJDs Taslimuddin who was believed to be invincible.        
	In Hajipur and Pataliputra too, Muslims in good proportion shifted to the Congress, allowing the NDAs nominees to drub Paswan and Lalu Prasad.         
	While Lalu Prasad lost by over 23,000 votes in Pataliputra, Paswan lost Hajipur by 37,000 votes.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | You are coming from the Maoist area, tell us where they are or we will kill you
                                                                                                           You are coming from the Maoist area, tell us where they are or we will kill you
                          THE START: Armed with minesweepers, security forces set out from Pirakata, 17km from Lalgarh            THE RESISTANCE: At the mouth of Malida, 3km from Pirakata, the security forces run into a wall of vigilantes            THE HITBACK: After warnings  to disperse were ignored, the police   fire tear gas shells and scatter   the villagers            THE ROUND-UP: Police look for suspects at Malida            THE MOP-UP: A policeman picks up a brick to break open a locked office of the People rsquo;s Committee Against Police Atrocities                    
	Sanat Kumar Sinha, a photographer with The Telegraph, was caught in the battle between security forces and villagers near Pirakata on the road to Lalgarh on Thursday afternoon.        
	Sinhas photographs tell the story of how the forces broke up a group of vigilantes. However, soon after taking these pictures and despite showing his media identity card, Sinha was beaten up by a policeman, injuring the photographers left arm and right leg.        
	Sinha recalls his hour of horror near Pirakata.              
	I told the uniformed man in front of me that I am from the media. I showed him my accreditation card.        
	But that did not satisfy the man in his early thirties in khaki uniform with padding on his body and legs and the word police written on it.        
	Before his superior could stop him, he started raining blows on a fellow photographer and me till we fell into the thorn bushes lining the road.        
	The trouble started when we landed right in the middle of the battle between the police and villagers and started taking pictures of the battle. About an hour earlier, when we were near Lalgarh police station, we had heard that the police were entering the village and had rushed to the spot.         
	Three kilometres away from Pirakata, we encountered villagers running towards Lalgarh.         
	We advanced and found ourselves caught in the police firing and tear gas shelling. The police were making the same noise as the villagers, beating their hands against their mouth and screaming obscenities. There was a distance of about 800-900m between the villagers and the police, and we were in between.              Up ahead            In Jhikira, a village 3km from Lalgarh and out of reach of the security forces till Thursday evening, crowds were seen either digging up roads or mobilising support.

	The police started abusing us and asked us to stop taking pictures. They kept saying: Camera bondho kor, chhobi tulbi na. Toder jonnoi eto jhamela hoyechhey (turn off the camera, stop taking pictures. You are the ones responsible for the trouble here).        
	We turned off our cameras and got off our bikes and stood by silently.         
	A policeman came forward and started abusing us and threatening us.        
	Maobadir jayga thekey aschhish maobadi ra kothay achhey bol naholey merey debo (you are coming from the Maoist area, tell us where they are or we will kill you), the policeman told us.        
	Although we had already put away our cameras, the policeman rushed towards us and beat us with a stick. He was carrying a stick, not a baton, that looked like it had been yanked off a tree.        
	The police officer in charge of the troops and the CRPF behind the police started yelling at him to stop beating us but he did not stop. He landed some blows on my left arm and elbow and on my right thigh. It was at this point that the officer in charge dragged him away. We had been beaten up for at least five to 10 minutes before the others intervened.        
	The CRPF practically rescued me and took me to their pharmacist who put medicine on my wounds.

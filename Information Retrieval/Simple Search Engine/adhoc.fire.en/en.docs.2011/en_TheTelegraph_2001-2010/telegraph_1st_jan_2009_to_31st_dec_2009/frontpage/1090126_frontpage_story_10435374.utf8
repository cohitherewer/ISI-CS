The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Launch to the future
                                                                                                           Launch to the future
                                            
	For three weeks spanning October and November last year, the nation caught a glimpse of a possible future, distractive yet promising, distant yet alluring, now transformed into a tangible.         
	 In a period sandwiched  unintentionally  between burgeoning worries about the economy and the terror attacks in Mumbai, India took its most visible steps towards exploring the solar system.         
	 The Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft reached lunar orbit  and captivated the nation. Over the years, satellites built by the Indian Space Research Organisation have served people in India in a myriad ways: delivering lessons to remote classrooms, guiding fishermen to sea zones teeming with fish, connecting doctors in cities with patients in remote villages, and warning coastal communities about impending cyclones.         
	But its the Chandrayaan-1 mission  with its display of spacecraft technology, orbital dynamics and precision guidance  that appears to have enraptured the nation in a manner no other project hatched by Indias space agency in its 45 years has.         
	For Isro, Chandrayaan-1 is only a prelude to more ambitious goals  a lunar lander within the next three years, a mission to Mars five years from now, and Indian astronauts orbiting Earth in an Indian space capsule in seven years.         
	For the rest of the country, Indias first lunar mission carries a perspective-shifting potential.         
	In the space technology domain, India, in many ways, still lags behind members of the elite club  the US, Russia, the European Union, China, and Japan  that have chosen to explore the moon. But Chandrayaan-1 is, in some ways, an international mission. Six of its 10 scientific instruments originated in laboratories in the US or Europe. Foreign scientific teams are piggybacking on Indian spacecraft.                   
	Chandrayaan-1 has established a model that is likely to be replicated  an Indian space platform for joint exploration of interplanetary space. Indian teams are yet to finalise their own scientific payloads for either the Chandrayaan-2 mission scheduled for launch in 2012, or for the Mars lander mission in 2013. But Isro officials have indicated that foreign research groups are likely to be offered space for instruments on both.         
	Indias latest moves in space may generate an outcry from some quarters  some of it well-intentioned. Such clamour has surfaced earlier. In the 1970s, they questioned the rationale of a space programme in a developing country where hunger and disease were still rampant. In the 1990s, especially in between failures of launch vehicles, they argued it would be better for India to exclusively rely on foreign launches.         
	 A few Indian and foreign scientists have claimed that Chandrayaan-1 has had more value as a chest-thumping project than a science project. In the years to come, it shouldnt be any surprise if such arguments are pitched against Indias manned missions.         
	But Indias space endeavours have been riding on shoestring budgets. Isros annual budget is only a fraction of what is available to the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration or to the European Space Agency. Isro hopes to pull off its first manned mission at a project cost of Rs 12,000 crore  equivalent to what a large airline might have to spend to buy only 10 commercial jet aircraft.         
	Isros space exploration initiatives come after attaining a level of maturity in the technology of satellites, launch vehicles, and ground systems that support space activities. They also spring from a conviction among top space policy makers that India will need to demonstrate its space capabilities in order to join future international space science missions as a genuine partner.         
	India cannot afford to stay behind, said G. Madhavan Nair, the chairman of Isro. The technologies required for a manned mission in space, he said, are guarded and are unlikely to be shared by other countries.         
	Space programme officials are confident that the pursuit of goals in space will also have diverse spinoffs on the ground. Dozens of technologies used today in homes worldwide owe their origin to the US space programme.         
	The portable cordless vacuum cleaners used in households today emerged from a technology first used in the Apollo missions to extract samples of lunar dust. Some scratch-resistant glasses that block ultraviolet radiation are also based on technology originally developed for Nasa.         
	Insulated paints, water purification systems and improved radial tyres are among other spinoffs from space.         
	But the earliest spinoff from the Chandrayaan-1 mission may have been a nationwide revival of interest in science  space, in particular. For a country perpetually caught in countless other concerns  price rise, corruption, terror, among others  that kind of diversion has the potential to increase levels of scientific temper in society. The impact of such a development can only be positive.

	A relative recently  remarked that deaths by terror strikes have become as common as those by  natural causes. More so after the 26/11 attack.  Terror can never be  answered with terror and,  perhaps, the only recourse available is to shape these malleable young minds in another way, urging them to pick up pens rather than guns and help build a stronger India.   
	 I believe only education will prove our beacon. There is the need to arm ourselves with education and not  nuclear weapons. Small schools are mushrooming in bylanes across India and each such institution is  creating fresh dreams.  
	 Only because I am  educated do I know that certain miscreants are spreading hatred
  and not doing any  community service.  
	 Be it the young boy who toils by candlelight to finish his studies daily or the girl who walks miles to go to school, each and every  effort taken towards  education will lead to a brighter future for  individuals, the society and the nation as a whole.

          OUR BUREAU                                          Jamshedpur now a mission city. (Telegraph pix)      
	Ranchi/Jamshedpur, Oct. 21: After three years of wait, Jamshedpur can finally reap benefits under theJawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM).         
	A memorandum of agreement to this effect was signed in Delhi today.        
	The JNNURM funds will, however, come with a rider. Only an urban conglomerate, excluding Tata Steel command areas, will be entitled to harness the money.        
	Tata command areas have been excluded in the agreement. Notified areas of Mango and Adityapur, Jugsalai Municipality and non-Tata lease belt of Jamshedpur Notified Area Committee (JNAC) have been included, state urban development secretary Shailesh Kumar Singh said.        
	Singh signed the MoA on behalf of the state while joint secretary, urban development ministry, P.K. Shrivastava did so on behalf of the Centre. Assistant town planner Gajanand Ram and authorities of four civic bodies of Jamshedpur were present in Delhi.        
	Singh said projects worth over Rs 700 crore had been planned for Jamshedpur under JNNURM. These include a Rs 200 crore plan under basic services for urban poor aimed at slum development.        
	Under the urban infrastructure head, projects worth Rs 500 crore in sectors such as revamped water supply, sewerage and solid waste management have been planned.         
	Two other cities  Ranchi and Dhanbad  come under the purview of JNNURM. But third year of the ambitious scheme running, things are not moving in the right direction in either city.        
	Jamshedpur had been denied the privilege so far because Tata Steel had raised objection to inclusion of its command areas. In an interim order in September last year, the Supreme Court said the civic administration could develop the city excluding areas under the control of the appellant, Tata Steel in this case.

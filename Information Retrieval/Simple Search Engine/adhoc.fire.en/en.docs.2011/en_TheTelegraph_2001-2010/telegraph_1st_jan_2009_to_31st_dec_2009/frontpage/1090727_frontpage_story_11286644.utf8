	Mumbai, July 26 (PTI): Tax authorities cannot decide if an organisation can be considered a scientific research organisation in order to determine tax concessions, Bombay High Court has ruled.        
	Under Section 35 of the income tax act, money given to a research organisation can be deducted from income for calculating tax.        
	The organisation must have central government approval.

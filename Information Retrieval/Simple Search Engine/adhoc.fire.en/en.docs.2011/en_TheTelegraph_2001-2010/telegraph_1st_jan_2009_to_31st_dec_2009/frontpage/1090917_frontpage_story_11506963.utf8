The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Shh(ashi)! Laugh at your peril
                                                                                                           Shh(ashi)! Laugh at your peril
          OUR BUREAU                                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 16: In this season of the austerity epidemic, the Congress cannot be accused of profligacy on one count: humour.         
	A tweet by junior minister Shashi Tharoor has got the Congress all twitched up, bringing forth abomination worthy of a dour old party.        
	Tharoor had tweeted in reply to a question that he would travel by cattle class out of solidarity with all our holy cows.        
	Tweets are text-based posts of up to 140 characters displayed on the authors profile page and delivered to receivers known as followers (in Tharoors case, the particular follower happened to be a journalist).        
	The reference to cattle class did hurt the Congress that stands for the aam aadmi but what seems to have really got the partys goat is the crack at holy cows.        
	The Congress is now trying to figure out the identity of the holy cows Tharoor had in mind. Given the number of holy cows the oldest party in the land has, it should take some time to arrive at a consensus.        
	Was Tharoor taking a potshot at Sonia Gandhi, the spearhead of the current austerity mania, for setting the stage for his ouster from a five-star hotel where he was staying paying from his pocket?        
	Or was he throwing the tweet at Rahul Gandhi, who unfurled his brand of belt-tightening by travelling in a trains chair car  a ride that was unfortunately spoilt by stones hurled by mysterious miscreants? (Not read in Twitter: a joke doing the rounds is that police themselves might have thrown the stones to ensure that the young Gandhi sticks to his security routine and spares them the headache of guarding trains.)        
	The Congress would not answer such questions. But Tharoor, who tweeted and took a flight to Liberia en route to Ghana, is in trouble back home.        
	We totally condemn it (Tharoors tweet). It is completely unacceptable and can come from somebody who is unaware of our political culture and social realities, Congress spokesperson Jayanti Natarajan said. Certainly, the party does not endorse it. It is absolutely insensitive. We find it unacceptable.        
	The Congress has rarely condemned a minister in a similar manner at an official media conference. Sources said the issue was discussed by senior leaders and a conscious decision was made to send out a tough message to those who seek to ridicule the austerity measures.        
	More than what Natarajan said, what she left unsaid should alarm Tharoor more, if the political rookie can figure out the importance of silence in the party.        
	Asked if Tharoor should be dropped from the cabinet, she said it was for the high command to decide. On another question if making such an elitist person a minister was a mistake in the first place, the spokesperson said it was the prerogative of the Prime Minister.        
	Tharoor is scheduled to return on September 21, unless the tweet-quake brings him scurrying back.        
	Tharoors tweet came in response to a question by the follower who himself had referred to cattle class.         
	Cattle class is widely used to frown on the way some airlines herd passengers into the low-fare section, not a direct reference to the passengers themselves. Besides, Twitter is not meant for official discourse but chit chat  a tool millions use to celebrate the spontaneity of communication and the urge to get across their         
	140-character opinion on everything under and above the sun.        
	But Natarajan had done her own research. Cattle class is a jargon, a slang. A politician should not use it. In India, where millions of people travel by ordinary class, we dont show such insensitivity.        
	Those who know Tharoor, an author who has a way with words, said he could also have been referring to the general hysteria over belt-tightening by using a harmless pun (holy cow) that goes with cattle.        
	Not that the Congress does not have leaders whose razor-sharp wit can squeeze a smile out of even the most poker-faced colleagues and rivals. But the usually garrulous withdrew into a shell this evening, refusing comment even off the record  perhaps a reflection of a reluctance to be gored by those protecting the holy cows.        
	In a nation of such gravitas, Tharoor is unlikely to find many willing to bell the holy cows or enjoy a good laugh.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Task force to flush out Bengal rebels
                                                                                                           Task force to flush out Bengal rebels
          KUMUD JENAMANI                               
	Jamshedpur, Feb. 15: The arrest of a hardcore Maoist member from Chakulia has stirred the East Singhbhum police into action.         
	It has commissioned a special task force (STF) to launch an offensive exclusively against rebels from North Bengal operating in the Ghatshila sub-division of the district.         
	Uday Sarkar, alias Ujjwal, who was arrested on Friday, hails from Jalpaiguri district of Bengal. He is believed to have played a key role in a series of subversive activities, including the murder of Nagarik Suraksha Samiti (NSS) general secretary Dhanai Kisku and the landmine blast at Rajbhasa mines.        
	Talking to The Telegraph, East Singhbhum superintendent of police Naveen Kumar Singh said that the police had chanced upon vital details of Maoist operation in the district during Sarkars interrogation. It has come to light that at least 70 per cent of rebels operating in Ghatshila are originally from North Bengal.         
	Disguised as villagers, these rebels first travel up to Kokpara by train and then cross the Subernarekha by boat to reach Ghatshila.         
	Maoists from North Bengal are trained in local dialects before being inducted into the squad here. They are also provided with firearms after they enter the sub-division, said Singh.         
	Sarkar told the police that he had been inducted into the Putu Munda squad after he came from Jalpaiguri. The group has been operating in Ghatshila for five years. Several rebels from North Bengal have joined Mundas squad in the past.         
	Another hardcore rebel from North Bengal, Prakash, who was arrested in Cooch Behar two months ago, had also worked in the squad for two years. Sarkar has confirmed Prakashs involvement, Singh said.         
	The police chief claimed that the Munda squad, responsible for several incidents of violence, had links with the so-called human rights organisation, Peoples Union for Civil Liberties(PUCL).         
	Among other things, we have recovered a diary from Sarkar. It contains telephone numbers of several functionaries of the PUCL, he said.        
	Singh said the PUCL functionaries were in touch with the rebels and providing them tacit support. Numbers of some journalists were also found scribbled in the diary.         
	The district police will probe the PUCL link, Singh said. He, however, refused to divulge the names that were found in the diary.

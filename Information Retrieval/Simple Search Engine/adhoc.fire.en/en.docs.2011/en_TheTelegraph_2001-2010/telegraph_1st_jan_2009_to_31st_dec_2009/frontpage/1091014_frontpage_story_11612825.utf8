The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Swraj sits out over allowances row
                                                                                                           Swraj sits out over allowances row
  - At my request, investigation has been ordered: Deputy Speaker           AMIT ROY                            Swraj Paul: Ready for probe                                        
	London, Oct. 13: Swraj Paul told The Telegraph today that he had asked the House of Lords to carry out an investigation into charges that he claimed allowances after designating as his main home a flat he never slept in.        
	Until the investigation was over, he thought it best not to preside over the proceedings of the House of Lords in his capacity as deputy Speaker, the first Asian to hold the post, Paul added.        
	Paul was rostered to sit at 5pm yesterday on the famous Woolsack, the traditional seat of the Lord Speaker in the upper chamber.        
	In the morning, I had requested the House authorities to start these investigations, said Paul. And they have agreed that at my request, they will start this investigation into the charges made. They will decide (the outcome)  and they have very clearly (stated) this is at my request. Thats the story.        
	 A report today in The Times, London, whose sister paper The Sunday Times has published critical reports, confirmed: A spokesman for the House of Lords said that the authorities would investigate after Lord Paul requested them to do so.        
	The paper quoted the spokesman: This investigation will be undertaken by the clerk of the parliaments, in his capacity as the House of Lords accounting officer. During the course of the investigation by the House authorities, Lord Paul will not undertake duties as a deputy Speaker.        
	 The authorities did not ask Paul to stand down temporarily as deputy Speaker  that decision was again taken by Paul himself.        
	 I told the authorities that I had rather not sit till the inquiry is held, the 78-year-old Paul told The Telegraph.        
	Asked whether the inquiry would take a few months, Paul said he thought it would take a few weeks. Its not a long inquiry.        
	 He added: Instead of (the authorities) taking the decision, I said I would like to be investigated. So thats what I have done.        
	The Sunday Times report is being seen as a response to The Daily Telegraph which broke the story about the misuse of expenses by MPs.        
	The Daily Telegraph has gone through the expense claims of MPs with a microscope, inflicting many casualties who have announced they will not stand at the next election.        
	The same attention has not been devoted to members of the House of Lords, but Paul is among about half dozen who have been singled out for attention. That Paul is close to Prime Minister Gordon Brown might also have stoked media interest in him.        
	According to The Sunday Times, Paul was claiming allowances for living out of town when he had a perfectly agreeable apartment in London. First, the paper said I had claimed 110,000, a week later they said 38,000, Paul said.         
	Peers can claim an attendance allowance but whether it is intended to help those who have to make the journey from out of town or whether it is meant for anyone who puts in an appearance at the Lords is an issue for the inquiry to clarify. Paul does attend on a regular basis.        
	 In the case of Paul, The Sunday Times got into the nitty-gritty of his sleeping arrangements and whether he had spent nights in the flat in Oxfordshire. No way I am prepared to tell the untruth, reacted Paul. If I didnt sleep (there) I didnt sleep (there).        
	Paul seemed reasonably relaxed despite the publicity which he thinks is the price of having good friends  a reference to Gordon and Sarah Brown.         
	Some have disapproved that so wealthy a man should be taking an allowance at all but Pauls Caparo steel group, which is in manufacturing  a declining facet of the British economy  employs 3,000 people in the UK.        
	 It is possible that the Lords inquiry might order Paul to pay back some of the money he has claimed. After all, an inquiry into MPs expenses is not sparing anybody.

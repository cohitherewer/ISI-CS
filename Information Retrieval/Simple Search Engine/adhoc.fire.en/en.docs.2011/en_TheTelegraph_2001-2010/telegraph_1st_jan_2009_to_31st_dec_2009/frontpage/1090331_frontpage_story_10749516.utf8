                                Actress Julie Christie and actor Omar Sharif in a scene from David Leans Dr Zhivago                            
	Paris, March 30 (AP): Oscar-winning composer Maurice Jarre  who wrote the haunting Laras Theme from Doctor Zhivago and dozens of other film scores  has died, a French musicians guild said today. He was 84.        
	Jarre died in his villa in Los Angeles, where he had lived for decades, said SACEM guild leader Bernard Miyet, a friend of the composer. No cause of death was given.        
	The world of film music is mourning one of its last great figures, Miyet said. As well as his talent, Maurice Jarre cultivated an eternal good nature, a way of living and a simplicity that became legendary.        
	Born in 1924 in Lyon, France, Jarre studied music at the Conservatoire de Paris. He started his career composing scores for theatrical productions before working 12 years as permanent composer at the Theatre National Populaire.        
	He soon branched into composing soundtracks for movies, and in 1961 worked on director David Leans Lawrence of Arabia, for which he won his first Oscar.                  Maurice Jarre       
	He won a second for his work another Lean film Doctor Zhivago, based on the novel by Boris Pasternak. The movies song Laras Theme became a hit single and earned him worldwide recognition.        
	Jarre collaborated with Lean again in 1984 on A Passage to India, winning his third Academy Award.        
	He received a lifetime achievement award at the Berlin Film Festival in February, after a career including more than 150 soundtracks. He worked with some of Hollywoods most well-known directors including William Wyler, John Huston, Franco Zeffirelli, Volker Schlondorff, Peter Weir, Michael Apted, Alfred Hitchcock and Alfonso Arau.        
	Jarres musical style was noted for his use of ethnic instruments, and later synthetic sounds. He had a sense of grandeur and knew how to translate in a very short time, very few notes, absolutely essential feelings, French film music expert Stephane Lerouge said.        
	French President Nicolas Sarkozy hailed Jarre as a great composer who bequeaths us a generous and majestic body of work.        
	In choosing to work above all for the cinema ... Maurice Jarre broadened the public for symphonic music, Sarkozy said. He showed everyone that music is just as important as images for the beauty and success of a film. Jarre was married four times. He is survived by two sons, screenwriter Kevin and electronic musician Jean-Michel, as well as a daughter, Stefanie.

                                                                                                           Double whip on ragging
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                      No fear                          
	New Delhi, Feb. 11: The Supreme Court today empowered colleges and professional bodies to suspend students involved in ragging without waiting for a probe and linked grants to urgent action.        
	The message came one-and-a-half years after a bench drew up anti-ragging norms in May 2007 to rid educational institutions of the menace, a supposed ice-breaker between seniors and juniors that often borders on abuse.        
	Delay in many cases would frustrate the need for taking urgent action. If authorities are prima facie satisfied about the errant act of any student, they can in appropriate cases pending final decision suspend the student and give opportunity to him (later) to have his say, the court said.        
	The bench said such a measure was needed as a question had been raised about giving the offender a chance to speak before expelling him.        
	The law has to be set into motion immediately by informing police, Justices Arijit Pasayat and M.K. Sharma added.        
	The court also said if it came to the notice of a university or controlling body that an institution was trying to shield errant students, they were free to reduce grants and even deny aid in serious cases.        
	In May 2007, when it drafted the anti-ragging norms based on the recommendations of a committee, the court had said failure by authorities or negligence or deliberate delay in lodging FIRs would be seen as an act of culpable negligence.         
	Today, the court directed all states, Union territories and educational institutions to act on the recommendations of the R.K. Raghavan panel, which had said regulatory bodies were not doing enough to check ragging.        
	The committee had also urged the court to issue an order that binding regulations should be framed.        
	The court directed professional bodies like the bar and medical councils and the UGC to frame regulations making the norms binding on all.         
	Ragging in essence is a human rights abuse, it said.        
	Justice Pasayat said ragging was a set of undisciplined activities undertaken by seniors to break the ice with juniors, who have been suddenly thrown into a totally new set of environment, he said.        
	But the act by the seniors was a fist of steel against ice which shattered the ambition of freshers who become aloof in this practical world.        
	The committee had also proposed anti-ragging cells at state, district and college levels, anti-ragging hotlines and anti-ragging chapters in textbooks to curb the menace. The court has accepted all these recommendations.        
	The court posted the matter for hearing in March.

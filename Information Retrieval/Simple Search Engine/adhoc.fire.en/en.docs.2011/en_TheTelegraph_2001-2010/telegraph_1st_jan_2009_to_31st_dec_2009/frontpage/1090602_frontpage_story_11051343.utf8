                                                                                                           Council gave rebels crores
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Guwahati, June 1: A former chief executive member of North Cachar Hills Autonomous Council, Depolal Hojai, was detained by city police this evening in connection with the diversion of council funds to militant outfits.        
	Following the arrest and interrogation of the current chief executive member of the council, Mohit Hojai, police investigations revealed that the departments under the North Cachar Hills Autonomous Council used to divert 10 per cent of their development funds to militant coffers. Hojai was arrested along with the councils liaison officer, R.H. Khan, from Halflong on Saturday. Sources said a section of senior council members had allegedly entrusted Khan with the task of managing local militant outfits, particularly the Dima Halam Daogah (Jewel).         
	Khan liaised between the council and the DHD (J) and was instrumental in diverting 10 per cent of the development funds to militant coffers, including that of the DHD (J), for the past several years, a police officer said. The money ran into several crores of rupees every year as the autonomous council controls 30 departments, he added.         
	The police said the departments used to deduct 10 per cent of the total amount at the time of release of funds and channelise it to rebel groups.         
	During a raid at Khans residence in Tarun Nagar here on Saturday, the police recovered unaccounted for money to the tune of Rs 4 lakh. The police seized the money as the accused could not properly account for it, the officer said.         
	Khan, a former deputy director in the social welfare department, has been posted in NC Hills district since 1996.         
	The collusion between Hojai and the DHD (J) came to light with the arrest of Phojendra Hojai and Babul Kemprai on April 1 night. The duo were carrying Rs 1 crore and were on their way to broker an arms deal for the DHD (J). They told interrogators that they had received the money from Hojai. Mohit Hojai has confessed that of the Rs 1 crore, Khan had given Rs 30 lakh, the officer said.         
	Police said Hojai went hiding somewhere in Delhi after the arrest of Phojendra Hojai and Kemprai. Both Hojai and Khan were remanded in two days police custody after being produced in the court of the chief judicial magistrate, Kamrup, here yesterday.         
	They are being interrogated by officials of the Subsidiary Intelligence Bureau and the special branch of Assam police regarding their links with the DHD (J) and other militant outfits. More arrests are likely to be made on the basis of their statements, the officer said.

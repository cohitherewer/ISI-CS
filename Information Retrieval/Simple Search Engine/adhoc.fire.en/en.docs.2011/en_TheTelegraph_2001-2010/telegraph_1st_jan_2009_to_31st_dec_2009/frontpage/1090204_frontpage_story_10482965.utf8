                                                                                                           Nayachar on road to cabinet
          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 3: The plan to build a chemical hub spanning Nayachar and Haldia is on course to the final date with the Union cabinet with a central committee approving a Bengal government presentation today.        
	The committee also cleared an additional investment of Rs 400 crore which will be used to build railway infrastructure. The money is in addition to the Rs 2,108 crore promised earlier, taking the total projected central investment in infrastructure to Rs 2,508 crore.        
	The high-powered committee approved our presentation, Sabyasachi Sen, the state governments industries secretary, said in New Delhi.        
	Officials in Delhi said an inter-ministerial committee would meet again to give its formal clearance, following which the proposal would be placed before the cabinet committee on economic affairs.        
	An environment clearance will be needed after this. But infrastructure work can begin as soon as the cabinet gives the green signal that is expected sometime in March.        
	The approval of todays presentation means the Bengal governments work in Delhi is over. Now it is up to chemicals minister Ram Vilas Paswan, who is said to be keen on the project, to guide the proposal through the Union cabinet.        
	Central officials said the committee had sought clarifications on the break-up of infrastructure investment between private partners and the state government, which Bengal would be forwarding soon.         
	The entire infrastructure development for the hub is expected to cost around Rs 25,000 crore. This will be invested by PCR Chemicals Pvt Ltd, the joint venture between New Kolkata International Development, in which the Indonesian Salim group has a stake, and the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation.        
	Another Rs 75,000 crore is expected to be invested by various companies setting up units there. Around 10 lakh direct and indirect jobs are expected to be created.        
	Although the units in the chemical hub will be spread over Haldia and Nayachar, the project has come to be identified more with the island. Nayachar, a largely uninhabited island, was chosen after the original choice  Nandigram  created an unparalleled crisis for the Left government.        
	We will start an environment impact analysis on the site soon... it will take 12 months to complete, Sen said. The target is to set up sufficient infrastructure on Nayachar island by 2011 to enable refineries to be set up.        
	A ticklish area the state government needs to tackle is a view that Nayachar lies in the coastal regulation zone, where industry is prohibited under a 1986 law. Sources said an exemption could be made because of the huge investment involved.

  - Cong workers smell attempt to block post-poll bonus          ANANYA SENGUPTA                            Congress workers celebrate the Delhi election victory on December 8, 2008                                        
	New Delhi, Jan. 13: If only Corporate India had accountants as conscientious as that of the Congress in these times of gloom and doom.        
	The bean counters at the Grand Old Party are apparently sitting on bonuses usually handed to employees at 24 Akbar Road after a good election season.        
	Sources at the Congresss headquarters said rumblings of discontent among the partys lower-rung employees were getting louder over a buzz that no one may be paid their bonuses this time.        
	Some are blaming the party leadership for the uncertainty while others are seeing the hand of accountants out to please their bosses who could be bracing for the impact of the economic downturn on the war chest for the approaching general election.        
	Generally, the party rewards its workers within 15 days of an election victory. But many more have passed since the December 8 poll verdict in five states and the Congress triumph in three (Delhi, Rajasthan and Mizoram).        
	If the Congress does drop the bonus despite assurances to the contrary, it will be the first time in four decades that the tradition begun by Indira Gandhi will be broken. The penny-pinching will also be in sharp contrast with the generosity with which the Congress-led Centre has been announcing salary increases at government expense.        
	We were thinking we will get our bonus this time and the party will be happy to give it to us because this is a great moment for the Congress. But we are just seeing their delaying tactics, said a worker.        
	Party insiders said a group of workers had trooped to the office of Congress treasurer Motilal Vora to check out if there was any truth in the no-bonus buzz. He apparently assured them they would get their dues, but few came away convinced.        
	Many staffers fear that the accounting officers were trying to save the party pennies to curry favour with the bosses. They want to show that they have saved money for the party. Then the bosses will be happy, a disgruntled worker said.        
	We dont get any benefits from the party anyway. They dont let us get any PF or loans because we would need to show our source of income. Then the partys source of income too would have to be explained. We get what we earn here, post that nothing.        
	The bonus paid to a party worker varies with the grade he or she belongs to and typically comprises a months salary plus 15 days additional salary.        
	The workers fall in four categories: Grade I includes administrative officers and supervisors who get about Rs 20,000 a month; Grade II -- private secretaries --earns Rs 17,000; Grade III comprises drivers who are paid Rs 5,000-Rs 10,000, according to inter-personal relations; Grade IV includes peons and others who earn a maximum of Rs 5,000.        
	Sources said the lower-rung staffers would be the losers if bonuses were dropped as the top-grade employees had additional means of income. Many private secretaries apparently had lavish lifestyles, and were constantly given gifts by their bosses guests. One recently got a Rs 26,000 mobile phone as a gift.        
	None of the 150 workers at 24 Akbar Road would agree that the probable bonus cuts were an austerity measure in the time of recession. Had party general secretaries got any such directive, they would not spend Rs 2,500 a day on tea and refreshments, some said.        
	Nor would 10 new cars have arrived recently at the party headquarters.        
	The sources said there was no cost-cutting on stationery and other expenses. Moreover, when MPs recently got a pay hike, other leaders kicked up a ruckus and got themselves increments too.        
	When a leader is an MP and also general secretary, he/she gets salary from Parliament and the party, which is written off as expenses. We arent sure if our pleas reach Madams ears, a worker said.        
	But the old hands are not complaining. Even the gods are afraid of politicians. Do you think we will anger them? We have families to look after, a veteran staffer who has been with the Congress since the time of Jawaharlal Nehru said.

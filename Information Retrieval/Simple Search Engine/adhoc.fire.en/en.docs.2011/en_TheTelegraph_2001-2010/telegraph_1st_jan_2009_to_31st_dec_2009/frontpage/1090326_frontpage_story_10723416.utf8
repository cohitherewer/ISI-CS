										      NONDON BAGCHI rediscovers his childhood passion for fruit preserves.                                                
	Somewhere in the family archives there is a black-and-white picture of myself, slumped down in a armchair in our living room, completely disgruntled and scowling. Clicked candidly by a brother-in-law he titled it No Jam Today, because that was the precise reason for my being in a black mood.        
	It was breakfast time, and there was no jam in the house. How could I follow my daily ritual? First course was always fried country eggs on toast, sunny side up, the yolks done to perfection  still soft, but not runny  sprinkled with salt and fresh ground pepper with just a dash of ketchup on the side. Next came more toast  thick ones, cut from the loaf, not pre-sliced  lightly toasted, spread liberally with butter, topped with oodles of jam, with a final layer on top of thick cream which had formed after boiling good buffalo milk in the house.        
	Of course, I rounded on Mother, because this was her department: Why does something always have to finish before it gets replaced? Why cant there be just a little forward planning?        
	Mother shot back that shed had more than enough to think about lately and there was no need to behave like a spoilt brat (I was about 15 years of age); Bordi quipped that my spats with Mum were just like the ones between Tony Lumpkin and his mum in She Stoops To Conquer. Other wisecracks flew around. But nothing could change the fact that there was no jam on the table. I have always been a sucker for preserves and conserves of every kind  from jam to marmalade to jellies (not table jellies, but the preserve, which are made following a principle similar to that of jam making). A cookery encyclopaedia I have says virtually everything about the subtle differences between the processes involved in the making of all these delights. It dwells on matters like levels of pectin, acid and sugar, cooking time, consistency, temperatures and such, but these are after all mere technicalities. Bottomline is, jams, jellies and marmalade rock.        
	A universally accepted fact about this subject, though, is that home-made products are almost invariably superior to commercially available ones. When I was sulking about no jam for breakfast some 40 years ago, and even today, most jams available at neighbourhood groceries in our domestic market have the same table jelly-like consistency, no sign of fruit bits or pieces, theres no knowing how much is essence and flavour and how much is real fruit and sometimes you cant even identify clearly the fruit its meant to be made of.         
	But its still jam, and when it comes to jam, something is always better than nothing. Things have improved a lot, though, because today, along with the stalwarts I mentioned above, a whole new range of imported preserves has become available  not at the local grocers perhaps, but at all supermarkets and higher-end shops.         
	St Balfour, of France, is the front runner with good quality and variety. Thick apricot, strawberry, raspberry, mulberry, black currant, to name a few. Dana, a Danish brand is also good value for money; they make an excellent plum jam and also good apricot.        
	Tify is a Delhi-based outfit, which imports and markets various preserves. I particularly like their raspberry jam, which is made in England, a country that understands their jams, and particularly marmalades. Its still difficult to get good English marmalade made from Seville oranges, but not impossible.        
	One Indian product which is as good, if not better, than all the imported ones is a strawberry conserve made by Tata under the brand name High Range. The best available, though Im told they only do strawberry as of now.         
	And home-made? The best gooseberry jam Ive ever had, made by Aunty Ruby Zachariah every year when they were in season. We always got two huge bottles, which kept me cheerful for weeks. Her son took the No Jam Today photograph.        
	And guava jelly made by Aunt Sunanda Dasgupta. You opened the lid, and the whole house became fragrant.        
	Mmm        
	And Mrs Darlingtons home-made apricot and raspberry jam bought on a Thursday (market day) in the sleepy old village of Homecastle, Lincolnshire.         
	The best thing about jam and jelly preserves is their versatility. We use them in desserts, puddings, layer cakes with them, make tarts and pastries, and even pair them with savouries. Try a jam and cheese sandwich, or even spread a good dollop of it on your omelette!

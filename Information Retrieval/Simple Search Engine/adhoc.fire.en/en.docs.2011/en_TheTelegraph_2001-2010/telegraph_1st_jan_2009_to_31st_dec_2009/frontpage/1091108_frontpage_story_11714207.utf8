  - Celebrations dwarf politics as Tawang awaits Dalai Lama          ASHIS CHAKRABARTI                                                     
	Tawang, Nov. 7: The British had little use of it for their Great Game, until Henry McMahon unwittingly made things different in 1914. But this little monastery town, nestled in the high Himalayas, has suddenly become the centre of a war of words between India and China, thanks to the Dalai Lamas visit here from tomorrow.        
	Not that the people here are caught in that battle. They know about the Chinese objections to the visits of not only the Dalai Lama but also of the Indian Prime Minister last month. But all that has made them prepare for the Dalai Lamas visit in a festive mood.        
	If its high politics for Beijing and New Delhi, for the people here its, as the Dalai Lama says, religion and spiritualism. That Chinas Tibet is just across the nearest mountain ridge to the north doesnt make any difference to them.        
	Houses, walls and roads have been whitewashed. Tibetan prayer flags and streamers flutter in the wind against an azure sky. Last-minute touches are being given to the arches erected to welcome the Dalai Lama. Children are joining men and women in sweeping streets outside their homes. Far from talking about the war of words between New Delhi and Beijing, both in the officialdom and the media, the people seem to be enjoying a rare chance to enliven an otherwise placid life.         
	Its life as usual for us. The Dalai Lama was here last in 2003, unnoticed by the world and the media, said a young businessman who gave his name as Choumbay.        
	He knew about the Chinese statements: Thanks to TV, everybody knows about that. But why is it that the media are so excited about His Holinesss visit this time?        
	It was life as usual also for the old monk who passed on instructions to fellow monks at the 400-year-old monastery that has made this obscure place famous among Tibetan Buddhists. He brushed aside the Chinese objections and Beijings description of Arunachal Pradesh as a disputed territory. He had come here, he said, in 1960 from a monastery on the Bhutan-Tibet border.        
	Politely refusing to give his name, while saying he is the oldest monk at the monastery now, he pointed to the top floor of the three-storey main building of the Ga Den Namgyal Lhatse monastery where the Dalai Lama will stay during his visit. He stayed on that floor in 2003 also. The floor below is the living quarters of the head monk of the monastery, the Guru Rinpoche.         
	Its business as usual for the monasterys 500-odd inhabitants, mostly monks, except for the little excitement that the Dalai Lamas visit  and the sudden appearance of scores of journalists  has brought to their lives.        
	As they always do when celebrities and important people visit the monastery, the outer walls of the entrance to the main prayer hall have new coats of paint for the Buddhist murals and most buildings have had rough patches of whitewash, like elsewhere in the little town that is spread on the hillface on the other side.        
	Forget the passing flutter, and the monastery remains pretty much like a medieval Italian town or in many ways Oxford , as Verrier Elwin found it in the 1950s.        
	Here was the typical old Oxford jumble of little streets lined with tall houses, he wrote, here was the gentle, casual atmosphere which concealed so much formality and protocol. Here was the College Chapel, the Library, the Senior Common Room, the quad; even the kitchens were on a similar scale and had a similar ambience.        
	The monastery will now have a new library, to be opened by the Dalai Lama during his stay here. That apart, life in the monastery will go on as usual, barring the activities surrounding his visit.        
	His activities in Arunachal Pradesh are all about preachings and initiations of his Buddhist flock.        
	The oldest monk at the monastery, however, recalled how life had changed in Tawang over the years. There are so many people now, so many cars and shops.         
	But the little Himalayan town seems to be totally unprepared for the sudden media spotlight and the arrival of a large number of outsiders, including journalists, who seem to be completely at a loss over the local administrations inability to handle the event and, more woefully, the pathetic absence of a working telecommunications network or even a steady power supply.

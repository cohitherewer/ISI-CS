          AMIT GUPTA                             CISF cousin on cards                                  
	Ranchi, June 4: Two months and industrial units in the state can shed their security worries.         
	The home department has decided to raise an industrial security force in the state on the lines of the CISF (Central Industrial Security Force). Services of the force will be available on a demand and payment basis.         
	To begin with, two battalions of 30 units each will be raised. Each unit will comprise 40 armed security personnel who will be on call for banks, industries and other commercial ventures. Each battalion will be headed by a commandant, preferably an IPS, and comprise a deputy commandant of ASP rank and four assistant commandants of DSP rank. Every unit will be led by an officer of inspector rank.        
	Talking to The Telegraph, home secretary J.B. Tubid said there had been a demand for such a force for quite some time from Maoist-hit districts. More so with 50 new investment proposals (to the tune of Rs 2,75,000 crore) in the steel and power sector. The State Industrial Security Force (SISF) will be raised on the lines of the CISF. Armed personnel will be deployed at both private and government undertakings in lieu of payment, he said. If the demand for the force increases in future, the state will think of raising a few more battalions, he added.         
	We will start the recruitment process soon. Young men and women will be allowed to apply, Tubid said, indicating that former armymen would not be given preferences.         
	The decision to raise the SISF was preceded by a series of meetings between industry representatives and the state for two years. Governor Syed Sibtey Razi gave his final approval after an attack on Abhijeet Groups upcoming power plant at Chandwa in Latehar district in March.        
	There have been other instances when upcoming plants of Jupiter Cement and Electrosteel Castings Limited witnessed unruly scenes and destruction of property. To do away with similar incidents, the home department issued a a notification on June 3 to say that a state force would provide security to industrial and commercial units in the districts. The SISF will not be an urban force, Tubid said.         
	As far as costs are concerned, the state has worked out an annual expenditure of Rs 40 crore, most of which will be borne by corporate houses.        
	The move has been welcomed by industry captains. R.P. Singh, the chief executive officer of JSW Steel Jharkhand Limited, said: The initiative should have been taken much earlier given the not-so-friendly industry environment of the state. But it is better late than never. We are glad the step has been taken.

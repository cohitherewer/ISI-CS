The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Speaker bails out Roy govt
                                                                                                           Speaker bails out Roy govt
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Shillong, March 17: The ruling Meghalaya Progressive Alliance today survived the trust vote by the skin of its teeth with the Speaker bailing it out after voting ended in a tie.        
	The instability factor, however, continued to haunt the Donkupar Roy government with the Opposition Meghalaya United Alliance campaigning for suspended animation of the House.         
	The casting vote of Speaker Bindo Lanong saved the MPA today as both the government and the Opposition got 27 votes each after five legislators, who had deserted the ruling alliance, were denied voting rights following their interim disqualification.         
	The Congress-led MUA staged a walkout and termed the trial of strength as unconstitutional.         
	Soon after the House assembled, the Speaker announced that five legislators  Independents Ismail Marak and Limison Sangma, KHNAM member Paul Lyngdoh, HSPDP legislator Adviser Pariong and NCP member Sanbor Shullai, who is also the Deputy Speaker  had been disqualified last night for deserting the MPA.         
	Shullai turned up late and voted in favour of the Opposition though it was not permitted. Except Pariong, the other four MPA deserters sat with the Opposition today.         
	The Speaker said he was not bound by the dos and donts issued by Governor R.S. Mooshahary on the trial of strength. The governor had asked the Speaker to videotape the proceedings and submit it to him, among other directives.         
	Quoting the legal opinion of Advocate-General G.S. Massar, the Speaker said Article 175 (2) of the Constitution did not empower the governor to send a message in the form of directives to the House. It amounted to usurping the Speakers power, he added.         
	The Governor can issue directives only on matters related to pending bills, he added.         
	Leader of the Opposition D.D. Lapang requested the Speaker to think about the implications of disqualifying the legislators as there have been instances where the Supreme Court and lower courts have nullified the Speakers decision.         
	Lyngdoh argued that he had only resigned from the MPAs council of ministers and not from the party, a requirement for disqualification.         
	However, the Speaker ruled that based on the complaints by MPA partners, prima facie, there was a violation of the provisions of Tenth Schedule by the five legislators. He said the members could fight the case within three months since the disqualification was an interim order.         
	Prior to the vote of confidence, Lapang also said since a no-confidence motion was filed against the Speaker, he should refrain from using his casting vote in case of a tie.         
	The House was adjourned for 15 minutes as Congress legislator Mukul Sangma demanded that copies of the governors message and the Advocate-Generals reply be distributed among the members.         
	After the House assembled, chief minister Donkupar Roy moved the confidence motion and it was put to voice vote. Later, division of votes was carried out wherein there was a tie.         
	With the Speakers casting vote going in favour of the MPA, Roy won the confidence motion with a margin of one vote.         
	The Opposition walked out, shouting Shame on the minority government. They claimed that they had 31 members who had voted in their favour while the MPA had 27.         
	In the afternoon, Lapang met the governor with 30 members and staked claim to an alternative government.         
	The governor is going through the video footage of todays proceedings of the House as requested by the Congress.         
	In another development, the two Independents, Lyngdoh and Shullai filed petitions in the Shillong bench of Gauhati High Court against their interim disqualification.        
	AICC general secretary in-charge of Northeast Luizinho Faleiro said the five MLAs did not fall under the purview of the anti-defection law.        
	Moreover, the Speaker had disqualified them without giving them the mandatory seven days time to reply, he added.         
	The Congress hopes the MLAs will get a favourable verdict from the court by tomorrow.

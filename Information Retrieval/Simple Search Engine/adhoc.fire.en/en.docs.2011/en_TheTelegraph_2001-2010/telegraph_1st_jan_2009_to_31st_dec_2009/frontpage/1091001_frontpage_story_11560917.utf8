  - 50 Calcuttans on sympathiser list        OUR BUREAU                                                    
	Calcutta, Sept. 30: Investigators in Bengal have turned their attention to the finances of Maoists and their sympathisers, the money trail acquiring a dramatic edge following an unverified police claim that a key suspect has a life insurance policy for Rs 1 crore.        
	The police today said Chhatradhar Mahato, the leader of the Maoist-backed Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, had taken such a policy and also owned a house in Mayurbhanj in Orissa.        
	If the claims  the possession of neither is illegal  are established, it will raise the disturbing question of where Mahato found the money to sustain both.        
	A Rs 1 crore insurance policy usually requires payment of an annual premium between Rs 12 lakh and Rs 15 lakh. Mahatos known source of income is trading in sal leaves, which under normal circumstances is not known to yield such amounts.        
	However, the police clarified that the disclosure had been made by Mahato, who was arrested by officers posing as media persons on Saturday, during interrogation and it had not been verified yet.        
	Chhatradhar said during interrogation that he has a Rs 1-crore insurance policy and owns a house in Mayurbhanj. However, we are yet to verify his statements. We will also scrutinise documents, said the states director-general of police, Bhupinder Singh.        
	However, the police appear to have got more concrete leads on 160 suspected sympathisers of the committee. The committee is not banned but the police could act against the sympathisers if it is found that their money is being used to perpetrate violence or wage war against the state. The CPI (Maoist) is also not outlawed in the state, though a national ban is in place.        
	Armed with the leads provided by Mahato, the police arrested Sukhshanti Baskey, treasurer of the committee, from Lalgarh today. One of the charges slapped on Sukhshanti is extortion.        
	The list of 160 sympathisers who allegedly offered money or support in other forms to the committee has been prepared. We have come to know that there are more than 50 persons from Calcutta who helped the committee by donating money, said a CID officer.        
	Echoing the CID officer, Singh said a number of persons, who are not residents of Lalgarh, were in touch with the committee members regularly. We have information that a sympathiser from Calcutta had donated Rs 1.25 lakh to the committee fund, the director-general added.        
	A police source said the committee needed funds to run community kitchens for thousands of tribals who participate in rallies.        
	Aware of the implications of an immediate crackdown, the police clarified that they would ascertain the extent of the sympathisers links with Maoists before deciding on the next move.        
	Singh said Mahato told the police there were bank accounts in the name of the committee in Jhargram. He told us about bank accounts in the name of the committee in various branches in Jhargram, the police chief said.        
	The police claimed Mahato had told them he was in touch with his brother and Maoist action squad member Sasadhar and other Maoist leaders, including Kishanji and Bikash. Earlier, the Intelligence Branch had said Bikash and Sasadhar were the same person.

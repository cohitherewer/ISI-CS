The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Manmohan mantra   Transparency and accountability in drive for Decade of Innovation
                                                                                                           Manmohan mantra
   Transparency and accountability in drive for Decade of Innovation										      OUR BUREAU                        Manmohan Singh and Pratibha Patil arrive at Parliament on Thursday. Picture by Rajesh Kumar				                                       
	New Delhi, June 4: Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs government has set itself a lofty New Deal agenda, informed by a young, yearning India and strongly tethered to performance, transparency and accountability.        
	The dreary desert sand of dead habit must be left behind. Our young people are tearing down the narrow domestic walls of religion, region, language, caste and gender that confine them. The nation must invest in their hope..., President Pratibha Patil quoted Rabindranath Tagore to tell a joint session of Parliament today.        
	Spelling out the newly elected administrations determination to address aspirations and challenges encoded in the electoral verdict, she added: The next 10 years would be dedicated as the Decade of Innovation. It may be a symbolic gesture but an important gesture to drive home the need to be innovative in finding solutions to our many challenges. Indias young population is naturally restless and wants to see change quickly. My government carries the weight of their dreams.        
	But before her speech turned to flair, it made a series of down-at-heel pledges, the most significant of which concerned enrichment and expansion of social sector programmes under constant, and often independent, monitoring.        
	Patils speech repeatedly emphasised the need to focus on women, children, socially and economically weaker sections and the rural sector, and committed the government to a slew of programmes and initiatives, old and new. But alongside was her constant stress on transparency and monitoring  surely an insistent new ethic of governance.        
	In the interest of pushing performance and public accountability, the government is to set up an independent evaluation office for all flagship programmes. This new body will be a creature of the Planning Commission but the key idea is to bring in leading social science research organisations and make it an autonomous auditor.        
	Apart from this, a delivery monitoring unit will be created in the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) to watch over all flagship and iconic projects. All ministers overseeing flagship programmes will have to deliver quarterly progress summaries, called Bharat Nirman Reports, to the public.        
	It is not clear yet how such split-level scrutiny will be calibrated or co-ordinated. There appear to be obvious overlaps of function here but perhaps the PMO would itself become the nodal agency for processing and publicising progress, or the lack of it, in flagship programmes.        
	There are examples of newly created government bodies like the National Investigation Agency (NIA) which got a fleeting mention in the Presidents address  lacking for enabling follow-up action in order to make them viable and productive wings of government.         
	But the President exuded a strong sense that empowered with the new mandate, the Manmohan Singh government was newly determined to pledge itself to goals, many of them time-bound.        
	Among the tasks it wishes to initiate within a hundred days of assuming office are one-third reservation for women in legislatures, creating national councils for both health and higher education and developing a brain gain strategy to attract talent back (see below).        
	Aruna Roy, who played a key role in drafting legislation for both the rural job scheme and the right to information, welcomed the proposal for the independent evaluation body but wanted it to be broadbased.         
	Any independent inquiry into the functioning of social sector schemes is welcome. But the inquiry or audit process must be completely transparent and must involve the participation of the local population. No one group of experts, irrespective of their qualifications, is equipped to gauge the success or failure of schemes that grass root in nature, she said.        
	Ramachandra Guha, historian and commentator, responded with cautious approval. Its a bit of a welcome departure from the past, even if it is rhetorical at the moment. The new commitment to performance and accountability is a good thing but in a sense it is also an admission of past failure. The Congress has ruled this country for most of the time and if it is now saying it will perform and be held accountable, it is also admitting in a way that it bungled most of the time.        
	The President also flagged internal security, communal harmony and the welfare of minorities as key areas of attention, even as she focused on economic growth and social sector reforms.         
	Stating that the government was acutely conscious of the challenge of rising expectations, Patil said: This will require re-energising government and improving governance. It will require meeting the challenge of restoring economic growth, which is now hurt by the global economic slowdown, back to a higher growth path.        
	All of that, she stressed, will come through a working commitment to the tasks the government has set itself and by responding to the message of the electorate.        
	It is a mandate for inclusive growth, equitable development and a secular and plural India. The yearning of our people for inclusiveness  economic, social and cultural  and the rejection of the forces of divisiveness and intolerance that my government spoke of in 2004, continues as both its inspiring vision and its unfinished business.              
	100-Day target  
	Some of the measures the government has  promised to ldquo;initiate rdquo; in the next 100 days    Create independent evaluation office to strengthen public accountability of flagship programmes  Delivery monitoring unit at PMO to track flagship programmes and make public status reports  Annual reports on education, health, employment, environment and infrastructure  Quarterly reporting on flagship programmes. Ministers to publicly detail progress  Early passage of the womens reservation bill  Constitutional amendment to provide 50% reservation for women in panchayats and municipalities  More central government jobs for women  A public data policy to disclose all information covering non-strategic areas  Enforce social audit of NREGA and ensure grievance redress by setting up district-level ombudsmen  Overarching regulatory body in health  National Council for Higher Education to reform regulatory institutions  Develop a brain gain policy to attract talent from abroad to 14 proposed innovation universities  Voluntary national youth corps for social action  Provision of scholarships and social security schemes through accounts in post offices and banks, and phased transition to smart cards    
	ECONOMY        
	Divestment
  Road map to be prepared; but government stake in state-owned enterprises will not drop below 51% 
  Why now? 
  The communists no longer have the influence to scupper the plan. Money could be used to fund big social sector projects; funds may also be used to bridge the yawning fiscal deficit        
	Turbocharge the economy 
  Relax policy on foreign investment inflows, recapitalise public sector banks and establish a pension regulator 
  Why now?
   To enable firms to access overseas funds and ensure PSU banks are healthy; get the pension reforms off the ground        
	Tax reform 
  Prepare a road map for the introduction of a goods and services tax (GST) which will replace a confusing tier of indirect levies 
  Why now? The GST has to be in place by April 1 next year; the ultimate objective is to have a uniform value-added tax of around 16% as in most western countries         
	Infrastructure 
  Increase public investment in infrastructure; focus will be on railways, power, highways, ports, airports and rural telecom network 
  Why now? Jumpstart the economy through aggressive spending in infrastructure projects which will boost demand; hope to get the economy chugging again at 9%

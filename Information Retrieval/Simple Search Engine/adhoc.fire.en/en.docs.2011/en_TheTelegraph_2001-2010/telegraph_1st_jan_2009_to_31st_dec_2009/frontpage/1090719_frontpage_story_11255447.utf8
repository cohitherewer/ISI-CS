                                                                                                           Ethnic clashes spill to Cachar
  - Zeme Nagas attack Dimasa village        OUR CORRESPONDENT                                           
	Silchar, July 18: The ethnic violence in North Cachar Hills district spilled into neighbouring Cachar when a group of Zeme Nagas attacked Sanpur, a Dimasa village under Lakhipur subdivision, and torched 15 cottages around 11am today.         
	Sources said the attackers also abducted two Dimasa youths who pleaded with them not to set the houses on fire.        
	The raid was the first instance of tribal violence in Cachar district in the aftermath of the skirmishes between the Zeme Nagas and Dimasas in NC Hills in March.         
	According to reports from the district police headquarters in Silchar, at least three persons were injured when the Zeme Nagas fired indiscriminately at the villagers.        
	A team of police and CRPF personnel rushed to the spot and launched a hunt to apprehend the raiders.        
	Todays incident coincided with the fast-unto-death by Dimasa tribals at Kumicherra village on Thursday, demanding the deployment of army troops in their area to protect them against the Zeme Naga marauders.         
	The fast is continuing despite the Cachar district administrations plea to withdraw the agitation.        
	The ethnic violence in NC Hills district started in March with an attack on a Zeme Naga village by a Dimasa group.         
	The retaliatory strikes have continued ever since.        
	The state government has blamed the NSCN, particularly the Khaplang faction, for the ethnic flare-up.         
	On May 19, 10 gunmen stalled a jeep in which 14 passengers were travelling in, at Inrem Bungalow, nearly 7km from Mahur town in NC Hills.         
	The gunmen asked all the passengers to get down from the jeep, lined them up and asked them to reveal their ethnic identities.         
	They then segregated four Dimasa tribals from the group and sprayed them with bullets.         
	Sources said the police have already sounded an alert and intensified security to prevent further tribal violence in Cachar district.         
	Sources said two DHD (J) militants were killed in an encounter with the army at Umrangsu in North Cachar Hills this morning.

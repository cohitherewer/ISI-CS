          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             An image taken by Chandrayaan-1 relating to the presence of water on the moon. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 25: The discovery of the first water molecules by a Nasa instrument on Indias Chandrayaan-1 has illustrated a model of partnership in space exploration that Isro plans to emulate on its future science missions, officials said.         
	Isro will continue to offer slots for foreign scientific payloads aboard the proposed Chandrayaan-2 and on other future missions, but only after accommodating Indian experiments, they added.         
	Chandrayaan-1 carried four Indian payloads and six foreign-made science instruments, including the Moon Minerology Mapper (M3) which detected water molecules on the surface of the moon. The government has already approved the Rs 425-crore Chandryaan-2 spacecraft  a lunar orbiter and a lunar lander  which is expected to be launched during 2012-13.         
	Isro officials said the space agency had received a large number of requests from Europe and the US for science slots on Chandrayaan-2, a spacecraft whose exact configuration is still under design. We would welcome collaboration on an equitable basis  the data (from observations) have to be shared (with India), Isro chairman G. Madhavan Nair told The Telegraph.         
	Scientists said the reward from the M3 observations could bolster Isros image as a provider of low-cost space exploration platforms. The cost of Chandrayaan-1 was only one-third of that of comparable space missions, said a senior Isro scientist.         
	The scientist said Isro, when designing new spacecraft, tries to draw on its existing spacecraft platforms. Chandrayaan-1 was build around the basic structure of one of Indias remote sensing satellites.         
	Designing something entirely is expensive. We cut costs through heritage, the scientist said.         
	Indian space scientists also claimed today that an Indian instrument dropped on the moon by Chandrayaan-1 three weeks after its launch may also have picked up a trace of water molecules.         
	The Moon Impact Probe (MIP) that crashed and splintered on the moon on November 14 had an instrument called a mass spectrometer that detected what appeared to be a signature of water, the scientists said.         
	But it was a one-shot observation, said a senior Isro scientist, suggesting that the single observation wasnt adequate to with- stand rigorous scientific protocols that demand repeated observations to rule out errors.         
	As the MIP fell towards the lunar surface, the mass spectrometer was sampling the lunar environment. At one point, the instrument recorded a molecule of weight 18, which suggested water, the scientist said.

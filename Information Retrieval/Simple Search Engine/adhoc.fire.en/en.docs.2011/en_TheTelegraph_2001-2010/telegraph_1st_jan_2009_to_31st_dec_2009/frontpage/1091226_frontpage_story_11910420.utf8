          MUZAFFAR RAINA       
	Srinagar, Dec. 25: Chief minister Omar Abdullahs home constituency, Ganderbal, has given Pakistan-occupied Kashmir its first woman deputy Speaker.        
	No other woman from either part of Kashmir has matched the feat of Mehur-un-Nisa, who is in her late 40s.        
	Jammu and Kashmir has had no woman deputy Speaker, Speaker or chief minister, though it has had woman ministers. Mehbooba Mufti is the only woman leader of the Opposition the state has had.        
	Ganderbal is used to the political limelight. Other than Omar, it sent his father Farooq Abdullah and grandfather Sheikh Abdullah to the Assembly several times.         
	Nisa is from Laar, which is also the village of Peoples Democratic Party leader Qazi Mohammad Afzal, who defeated Omar in the 2002 polls.        
	Nisa is married to Mohammad Yusuf Naseem, a former militant commander who is now a politician heading the PoK chapter of the Peoples Conference.        
	The mother of three had left Kashmir in the 1990s on a valid passport. She became a legislator in PoK in 2006. Kashmiris from the Indian side are free to contest elections there.        
	Naseem is a lawyer. He had lost the Assembly polls from Ganderbal before militancy began. The couple have two sons and a daughter, who was born after Nisa shifted to PoK, Peoples Conference chief and senior Hurriyat leader Bilal Lone said.        
	Hurriyat sources said Naseem, who is in his early 50s, had crossed the Line of Control for arms training. He was a commander of the Al Barq who later took over the reins of the Peoples Conference, a source said.        
	Lone made it clear, however, that Nisa had no link with the Peoples Conference or the separatist movement. She is a literate lady who has joined mainstream politics (in PoK), he said.        
	After Partition, the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly had reserved 25 seats for the areas now under PoK, though no constituencies were marked. The seats have remained vacant.        
	Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, chief of the Hurriyats moderate faction, said he was happy at Nisas feat: It is great that a lady from our part of Kashmir is Azad Kashmirs first woman deputy Speaker.        
	Several men from this part have done better. Umar Farooqs grandfather Mirwaiz Yusuf Shah became the third president of PoK after being forced into exile to the other side by rival Sheikh Abdullah. The elder Mirwaiz was an advocate of Kashmirs accession to Pakistan. K.H. Khursheed, PoKs first president, too was from the Indian side.

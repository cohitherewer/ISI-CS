  - Friend or foe, Advanis cyber banners know no barriers          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                             Home minister P Chidambaram and Opposition leader LK Advani at the funeral of former President R Venkataraman in Delhi. (PTI)                                        
	New Delhi, Jan. 28: If you thought an online petition seeking a daylong cellular shutdown on January 30 to protest big industrys unqualified endorsement of Narendra Modi as Prime Minister is the hottest political property on the Internet, you could be right, and horribly wrong.         
	Hover a moment on the static petition (www.PetitionOnline.com/30JAN09/petition.html) and youll know why. The space has been engagingly encroached by a juggernaut campaign from adversary quarters. Bleeping above the angry plea is an insistent seduction away from it: a serial banner invitation to visit www.lkadvani.in, the fledgling, but flourishing, portal of the Prime Minister in waiting.        
	If you thought the ad got posted there by accident of logarithmic probability, a placement device often used by agencies for random site-selection, think again. Or just Google potential roadblocks to Advanis most determined bid yet for the top job  all of their spaces on the Internet have been embossed with the BJP leaders precision strikes.        
	Tap Manmohan Singh and the search yields an Advani for PM exhortation. Tap Sonia Gandhi, tap Rahul, tap Mayavati, even M. Karunanidhi, and the same pitch for Advani pops up.        
	Nobody in the BJP or the Advani camp is admitting this is well thought-out hot-pursuit publicity; what can be said, though, is that Advanis cyber promoters are close to sealing a marketing deal with Google. The worlds most-used search engine could well be obliging with promised goods in anticipation.        
	The battle for India may yet be a good few months away, but the conquest of cyberia is being well ensured for Techpurush Advani.                           
	At 9,000 hits a day and a claimed average of four page-views per hit, the BJP boss is aeons ahead of his rusty competition. Whats more, hes poaching on rivals with predatory alacrity, littering their webspaces liberally with his footprint.        
	Unfortunately for him, India isnt a web-saturated environment, else he could have been within reach of repeating an Obama.        
	But Indias minuscule web community --- an estimated 55 million on the higher side --- is no damper to the team that propels Advanis cyber-run.        
	We have no illusions that we are reaching a very small number, says Prodyut Bora, convener of whats come to be known as L.K. Advanis Communications Office. Advaniji himself is quite aware of the limitations of the Internet in India. But dont forget, 60 per cent of all Indian net users are in or around our eight big cities and they constitute 50 Lok Sabha seats. A hundred million will be first-time voters, and they are predominantly net users. Thats not insignificant. It is not for nothing he monitors his site constantly, several times a day, he knows what it can do for him and the party. This is nobodys hobby-horse, this is serious politics.        
	Bora, an IIM Ahmedabad graduate --- the first IIM guy to join politics full-time is his proud claim --- is a key cog in a small but high-powered operation skippered by Sudheendra Kulkarni, Advanis trusted ideas man.         
	Our eventual aim, says the bespectacled, 34-year-old Bora from Assam, is to make the BJP a completely automated party in three years, which will mean bringing the party in line with the best in the world. We cannot hope to replicate Obama here, but we can be inspired and learn. We are the only ones really doing it, and we are doing fabulously well.        
	Kulkarni, Bora amp; Co. work out of makeshift premises tucked behind a BJP MPs bungalow in Lutyens Delhi --- a dozen-strong team thats on-line virtually round the clock.        
	Advaniji keeps us on our toes, youd be surprised how tech-friendly and familiar he is, Bora says. Soon after the launch of his website and blog, he called me one day and asked for hits. I told him, and immediately he wanted to know page-views. He staggered me for a moment.        
	Bookmarked on Boras natty crimson laptop --- we are a totally wireless office --- are websites of several national parties and leaders, would-be competition. Take a look for yourself, nobody even gets close: 800 content pages, 400 photographs, 250 videos and we are constantly uploading, in fact, twice a day, Bora says. Sonias portal hasnt been uploaded in weeks, Rahul doesnt have one, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh does have an updated one but it isnt interactive and its government-powered.        
	Why though? Why wouldnt others invest and Advani does? Ask them, Bora says. I cannot figure why, its for them to answer.        
	Surely the Congress leader has the resources to acquire what the BJP leader has. Or is Advanis web offensive prompted by factors closer home? The daily net score of Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi, is, after all, still four times the high hits Advani has quickly achieved.        
	But Modis recent endorsement of Advani as prime ministerial candidate may have helped; www.lkadvani.in has not preyed into www.narendramodi.in or his other net spaces yet

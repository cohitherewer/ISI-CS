The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | An audit of true lies   Based on Satyam inputs, may be unreliable: PW 
                                                                                                           An audit of true lies 
  Based on Satyam inputs, may be unreliable: PW           OUR BUREAU                                                    
	Mumbai, Jan. 14: Auditor Price Waterhouse has said no one should rely any more on its audit reports and opinions expressed in the financial statements pertaining to Satyam Computer Services.        
	Those unfamiliar with auditing were shocked to hear that Price Waterhouse had relied on the numbers placed before them by the Satyam management while preparing reports on the company for eight-and-a-half years.        
	The disclosure was made public on a day Satyam appointed Deloitte Haskins amp; Sells and KPMG to restate the accounts.        
	Satyam was sucked into an accounting fraud on January 7 after its former chairman, B. Ramalinga Raju, confessed that he had been padding profits and cooking the books for several years.        
	The financial statements were prepared by the management of the company, Price Waterhouse said in a letter that went out to the Satyams new board of directors. Price Waterhouse audited Satyams books from April 1, 2000, to September 30, 2008,        
	We placed reliance on the management controls over financial reporting, and the information and explanations provided by the management, as also the verbal and written representations made to us during the course of our audits, the statement added.        
	Price Waterhouse said that after Rajus confession to a Rs 7136-crore fraud perpetrated over several years, its opinions on the financial statements of the company might be rendered inaccurate and unreliable.        
	Price Waterhouse said the contents of (Rajus) letter, even if partially accurate, may have a material effect on the veracity of the companys financial statements presented to us during the audit period.        
	The auditor wrote the letter in accordance with what it said was a Guidance Note issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India so that no one relies on the statements.        
	On January 8, a day after Rajus confession, Price Waterhouse had said the audits were conducted in accordance with auditing standards and were supported by appropriate evidence.         
	Todays letter does not mention any evidence, perhaps because of the obligatory nature of the note, as suggested by the auditor, and an assertion of client confidentiality on January 8.         
	But the letter has promised cooperation with the new board. It came amid reports that Satyams disgraced chief financial officer Srinivas Vadlamani had told investigators he used to take comfort and certify the accounts based on the audit findings presented by Price Waterhouse.         
	Not so scandalous        
	Although investors were scandalised by Price Waterhouses admission that it hadnt bothered to verify the numbers, the auditor fraternity wasnt terribly surprised.        
	Several chartered accountants said the role of the auditor was to certify that the companys financial statement was presented in a true and fair manner. Auditors are not investigators, said Kamlesh Vikamsey, partner of audit firm Khimji Kunverji amp; Co.        
	All auditors preface their report with a disclaimer: These financial statements are the responsibility of the companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. Price Waterhouse had this line in all its auditor reports for Satyam.        
	The statement brought into the open the grim reality of the audit practice: auditors do not question, tear and rip into a companys documented figures unless they have a very good reason to suspect fraud.        
	So, what really is the auditors job? There are three areas that an auditor focuses on: first, it must ensure the audit is conducted in accordance with the auditing standards accepted in India.        
	Second, an audit requires the examination on a test basis of the evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.        
	Third, it involves an assessment of the accounting principles used by the management and the estimates made by it. In doing so, the auditors evaluate the overall financial statement.         
	When Price Waterhouse says it relied on the companys financial statements, it wasnt doing anything extraordinary.

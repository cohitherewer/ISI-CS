The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Isro admits glitch after 8 weeks
                                                                                                           Isro admits glitch after 8 weeks
          OUR BUREAU                               
	Bangalore/New Delhi, July 17: A malfunction aboard Chandrayaan-1 has crippled an electronic eye used to maintain the spacecrafts orientation in its lunar orbit, forcing engineers to activate the only backup available.         
	An on-board sensor that tracked stars and helped ensure the spacecrafts antenna and its cameras pointed in the right directions began to malfunction on April 26, the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) said today.         
	Although Isro took steps to overcome the hurdle, the space agency remained silent about the glitch for over eight weeks. Senior Isro officials had asserted there was nothing wrong with any of the instruments aboard the spacecraft even after May 19, when Chandrayaan-1 was nudged into a higher orbit.         
	Chandrayaan-1, Indias first lunar orbiter, launched on October 22, 2008, and in orbit since November, carries five Indian and five foreign-made scientific payloads for observations of the lunar surface.         
	Three scientists from India, the UK and Sweden involved in receiving scientific data from Chandrayaan-1 had said on May 19 that they were unaware of any problem the spacecraft had encountered. Their assertions would indicate that Isro had not shared information about the star sensor failure with even some participating scientists.        
	An Isro official today said the space agency did not believe it was necessary to make public any information about the sensor problem in April or May.         
	We cannot reveal each and every anomaly that occurs in our spacecraft, an Isro official said. We noticed the problem and rectified it. Isro officials have also said there is no direct link between the sensor failure and the orbit change.         
	After the sensor failure, ground control engineers activated a set of redundant electromechanical sensors called gyroscopes and have been using images of the surface of the moon to determine the spacecrafts orientation.         
	The spacecraft is working satisfactorily. The gyroscopes are doing the same functions of the star sensor. Were getting images and data from the scientific payloads, Isro chairman G. Madhavan Nair told The Telegraph.         
	The reason for the sensor malfunction is still unclear, but it is possible that excessive radiation or particles from the sun disrupted the device, Nair said.         
	Isro officials also said the shift from the star sensor to gyroscopes was unlikely to cut short the mission. The life of a spacecraft depends on fuel, electronic packages and onboard power systems  not the star sensor.         
	Isro had detected the sensor fault on April 26, corrected it within a few days and raised Chandrayaan-1s lunar orbit from 100km to 200km on May 19, but officials asserted after the orbit change that there was nothing wrong aboard the spacecraft.         
	Once a spacecraft is launched, flight experience constrains the actual operation, said Carle Pieters, professor of geology at Brown University in the US and principal investigator of a payload called the moon mineralogy mapper.         
	Isro officials had said in May that the raised orbit required little maintenance and could thus help increase the life of the spacecraft and also enable studies on the gravitational field of the moon.         
	But at the 200km orbit, the number of manoeuvres required for normal operation would be lower than at the 100km orbit. The lower number of operations would also reduce the strain on the gyroscopes, sources said.         
	Mission scientists do not appear worried about the sensor failure. The spacecraft has gone around the moon 3,000 times over the past eight months and sent in more than 70,000 images.         
	Were continuing to get great images and observations, said Jitendra Goswami, director of the Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad, and Indias key scientist involved in data collection and analysis.         
	The information that comes out to us is the same quality as before  its just as good, Barry Kellet, the science investigator for one of the instruments at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the UK, said.         
	Isro chairman Nair said 90 per cent of the mission objectives had been completed and the rest of the work would be pursued over the next four to six months.         
	Once the mission objectives have been completed, we dont have to continue the spacecraft as it will cost a lot of money to maintain it, he said.

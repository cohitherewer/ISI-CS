										                Flames at the BSNL godown before the Fire brigade arrived. Pic by Arko Sen      Kolkata, July 23 (PTI): A fire broke out in the godown of a telephone exchange at Beliaghata in the northern part of the city this morning.  Fifteen fire-tenders fought the blaze for nearly four hours before bringing it under control. However, it took another two hours to fully douse the flames, Additional Officer-in-charge of Fire Services Pradip Pal said.  The public relations officer of the BSNL, S Mahapatra, said the cause of the fire was yet to be ascertained. He also said normal BSNL services were not hampered.

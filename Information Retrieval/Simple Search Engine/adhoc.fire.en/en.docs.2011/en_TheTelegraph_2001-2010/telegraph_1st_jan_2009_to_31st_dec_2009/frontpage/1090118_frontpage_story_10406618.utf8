  - After Hudson miracle, bird hit sparks scare in Calcutta        OUR BUREAU                            Only the tail of the US Airways plane sticks out of the frigid Hudson on Saturday, two days after its miraculous landing in the New York river with all 155 on board safe. The plane has been towed to the western side of Manhattan for inspection. (AP)                                         
	Calcutta/Guwahati, Jan. 17: After the Hudson Miracle, the Hooghly Mayday  but it turned out premature.        
	A JetLite pilot cried out Mayday  the international distress call  minutes after take-off from Calcutta this morning when air traffic control told him his left engine was giving out sparks and fumes.        
	Moments ago, the Guwahati-bound plane, with 54 on board, had taken a bird hit  enough to evoke thoughts of Thursdays US airliner whose brush with a flock of geese over New York shut down both engines before the pilot glided it down on the icy Hudson river, with all its 155 people safe.        
	Over the Hooghly, it wasnt all that bad, though. The Boeing 737-800s right engine was functioning perfectly. The pilot switched off the left engine and checked all cockpit equipment. Once he realised everything was fine, he withdrew the Mayday call, an airport official said.        
	An aircraft can fly on a single engine, a senior pilot said, but no one was taking any chances. Flight S2-361 turned round to land in Calcutta at 6.49am, 20 minutes after takeoff.        
	The pilot sought a priority landing (before other aircraft) but we provided full emergency landing, with ambulances and fire engines ready, the official said.        
	All 46 passengers and eight crew members were evacuated safely and most passengers were later put on a Jet Airways flight except 10-15 who refused to fly today.        
	I was looking out of the window. There was a huge sound and I saw fire break out on the planes left side. For a moment, I thought This is it, passenger DJ Poison (his professional name), 32, said in Guwahati.        
	The plane was wobbling, its nose dipping and rising. After the third dip, things stabilised. The pilot was simply great; he didnt let anyone panic.        
	We had a miraculous escape thanks to the pilot, said another passenger, Manish.        
	Officials said the pilots first reaction may have been involuntary  he had cried out Mayday instead of radio-signalling it.        
	It could have been serious but the pilot did well to switch off the damaged engine at once, a pilot said.        
	Calcutta witnessed three bird hits last year despite its 21 bird chasers and two sharpshooters.         
	Officials, who blame the nearby markets, said todays hit occurred 400 feet above the ground, by when the plane would have been some distance from the airport.        
	From the birds perspective, modern jet aircraft are a lot quieter than the old jet and piston-powered aircraft, biologist Richard A. Dolbeer told The New York Times. Its not perceived as a threat until its too late.        
	As deterrents, pulsating lights and reflective coatings need more research, he said, as do bird-detection radars for airports.

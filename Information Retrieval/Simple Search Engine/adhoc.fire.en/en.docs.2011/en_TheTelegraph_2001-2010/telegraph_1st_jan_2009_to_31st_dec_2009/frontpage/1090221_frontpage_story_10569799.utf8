The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Pay cut advice to protect jobs
                                                                                                           Pay cut advice to protect jobs
  - Problem deeper than projected: Govt         OUR BUREAU                      Pranab Mukherjee                                
	New Delhi, Feb. 20: The Centre today suggested workers at various levels might have to accept pay cuts to protect jobs.         
	The first official alert on what is fast becoming a standard procedure in the downturn-hit West  and gaining a toehold in some Indian companies  came in the form of an advisory from stand-in finance minister Pranab Mukherjee.        
	Jobs must be protected even if it means some reduction in compensation at various levels, Mukherjee told a labour conference in Delhi.         
	The government has been conscious of the magnitude of this still deepening (economic) crisis and has been taking steps to mitigate its impact. We must display the spirit of solidarity by sharing equally the pain of this crisis, Mukherjee added.        
	The appeal came on a day the government conceded that an estimated loss of five lakh jobs in the last three months of 2008 did not project the full magnitude.         
	I agree that it is only a sample survey by the labour bureau. It is not the report of the entire country. It does not reflect the total job loss, labour minister Oscar Fernandes said in the Lok Sabha in response to an assertion by the Left that 20 lakh jobs had been lost.        
	Asked if the statements would be construed as alarmist, a government source said: The UPA leadership has always been against the India Shining hype of the NDA. If there are fears of job losses, we must share them with the country. But pay cuts are better than job losses.        
	Sources said the government had been working on a plan to generate urban jobs.        
	Some sections of Indian industry agreed with Mukherjees suggestion but others were sceptical. Indian industry is working with responsibility to see itself through the crisis. Industry should try different methods of controlling costs and should not lay off in a knee-jerk reaction, Chandrajit Banerjee, the director-general of the CII, said.        
	Industry can certainly think over it (wage reduction) if workers agree. However, this is not a solution to the problems faced by the economy and textile sector, R.K. Dalmia, the president of Century Textiles, said.        
	The lack of incentives in Mukherjees interim budget appeared to be a sore point, although he had hinted at the possibility of some measures next week.        
	Rajendra Hinduja, the head of export house Gokaldas Exports, said: The textile and garment industry has been badly mauled and yet ignored by stimulus packages. I cannot digest what the finance minister is saying. The way out is not pay cuts but government incentives.        
	Sushma Errevelles of Talisman Management Services, a human resources consultancy, said that if salaries were cut now, it would have to be reversed later as the economy was expected to pick up on account of domestic growth.

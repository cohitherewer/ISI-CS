                                                                                                           Ambani chopper-alert official found dead
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, April 28: The aviation technician who discovered pebbles and gravel in the fuel tank of industrialist Anil Ambanis personal helicopter last week was today found dead near a railway crossing in the western suburbs.         
	The body of Bharat Borge, a key witness in the investigation to determine if there was an attempt to sabotage the business tycoons carrier, was recovered between the Vile Parle and Andheri stations around 8am.        
	A letter in Marathi was found on the 47-year-old technician, which says Borge feared he could be implicated in the case. PTI quoted the letter as saying some Reliance people met Borge, who felt they were using me. It was not clear which Reliance group the letter was referring to.        
	Borge was employed as a senior technician with Airworks India Engineering Private Ltd, which was responsible for maintaining the helicopter.         
	Government railway police commissioner A.K. Sharma said Borge, who lived in Bhyander in the far eastern suburbs, was identified from an Airworks identity card.         
	We have two eyewitnesses, including the gateman of the railway crossing, who shouted out to him about an oncoming train, but he was run over. We have also found a letter on him indicating that he was distressed and could have committed suicide, Sharma said.         
	On April 23, while the Bell 412 was being serviced at the Airworks hangar at the old airport, Borge was the first technician to discover that the filler cap of the fuel tank on top of the chopper had been tampered with.         
	Ambani was to fly the same chopper the next morning to go to his Navi Mumbai office.         
	Captain R.N. Joshi, a senior pilot with Reliance Transport amp; Travels Ltd, a part of the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group, had written to chief minister Ashok Chavan, stating that the sabotage was an attempt to murder Ambani by possible business rivals.        
	The letter found on Borge is addressed to Inspector Bole of the crime branch which is investigating the chopper tampering.        
	I have not done anything wrong. My parents have not taught me to do wrong. Reliance officials had come to meet me yesterday and I gave them my telephone number. They have not called me. I fear the whole blame would come on me. The investigation is going in the right direction and the truth will come out, the letter says.         
	Airworks described Borge as one its most valued members.         
	Reliance Transports Joshi had mentioned in his complaint that 13 people, including Borge, were designated by Airworks to access the helicopter during servicing.        
	The police said Borges wife, two sons and a daughter were away in their village in Satara on vacation.

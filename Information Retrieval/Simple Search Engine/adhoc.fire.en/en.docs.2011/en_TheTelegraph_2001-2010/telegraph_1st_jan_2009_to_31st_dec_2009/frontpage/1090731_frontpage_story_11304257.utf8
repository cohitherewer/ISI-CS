  - Krishna called Patil II after Pranab leads charge          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                            Krishna                                        
	New Delhi, July 30: An FM led the foreign policy charge in the Lok Sabha today but the abbreviation stood for finance minister, not foreign minister.        
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, not foreign minister S.M. Krishna, picked up from where the Prime Minister left off yesterday, prompting the Opposition to dub the dapper Karnataka leader Shivraj Patil II.        
	The allusion to the former home minister, whose fastidious sartorial preferences became a focal point when the frequency of terror strikes rose and eventually cost him his job, suggested that the Opposition is banking on Krishna to provide a chink in the new UPAs armour.        
	Mukherjee, foreign minister in the first UPA government, today mounted a spirited defence of the joint statement, insisting that the reference to Balochistan was a unilateral reference by Pakistan. The wording of the statement suggests so, too, as the relevant sentence names only one person: Prime Minister Gilani mentioned that Pakistan has some information on threats in Balochistan and other areas.        
	The BJP did not make too much of a hue and cry when Mukherjee kept pummelling the Opposition, going back to 1947 to trace the roots of the Balochistan problem. This is unilateral reference and when you describe it as unilateral, we are not a party to it, asserted Mukherjee.        
	However, when Krishna eventually replied  it is mandatory that the foreign minister discharges this duty  the Opposition bayed for his blood.        
	When the two Prime Ministers met, the question of Balochistan came up and we readily agreed because we have nothing to hide, Krishna said, setting off an uproar by the BJP.        
	Krishnas statement in itself did not go against the official policy  the Prime Minister had also said we have nothing to hide  but the Opposition seized on his words we readily agreed which seemed to be out of sync with Mukherjees assertion.        
	Krishna could have been referring to an agreement to include the Balochistan reference in the statement but the Opposition moved in for the kill, emboldened by the fact that the government did not deploy him as the spearhead though he is the foreign minister.         
	The Opposition then put Krishna through the wringer, grilling him repeatedly, terming his reply strange and eventually walking out.        
	We saw a very strange incident in the Lok Sabha today when the government fielded the finance minister to intervene in the debate. For the finance minister to intervene in the debate when the external affairs minister was present is strange. Pranab Mukherjee and the Prime Minister will not be always available for holding his hands, BJPs Yashwant Sinha, who was more or less silenced yesterday by the Prime Ministers reply, said outside the House.        
	He (Krishna) is proving to be the former home minister Shivraj Patil whom the Congress had to get rid of finally. Only that he (Krishna) is taking much less time to prove himself a Shivraj Patil, Sinha added.        
	Such twists of the knife will touch a raw nerve in the Congress as a now-expunged entry in Krishnas CV had mentioned designing menswear as one of his passions. The little detail was eventually removed.        
	That the government managers were looking for options other than fielding Krishna, new to a high-voltage post as that of foreign minister, as the pinch-hitter was evident on Tuesday night itself.        
	The party decided to pitch the finance minister for the discussion on foreign affairs in the Lok Sabha.        
	Salman Khursheed, the corporate affairs and minority affairs minister, was also chosen to speak. Although his credentials on the subject were impeccable, it was felt that a more senior minister was needed to counter the line-up of BJP speakers that included Sinha and Sushma Swaraj. Mukherjee was then sounded out with the party deciding that Khursheed would speak if time permitted.        
	If the Opposition keeps up the heat on Krishna and manages to repeatedly draw parallels with Patil, the foreign ministers detractors in the Congress could use the opportunity to seek his scalp.        
	When Krishna was picked for the foreign ministers job, the Congress second rung wondered whose choice he was: the Prime Ministers, Sonias or Rahuls or that of all three. Sources close to Krishna, credited with facilitating Bangalores transformation into an IT hub, celebrated his closeness to Sonia and Rahul but their claims had gone uncontested so far.        
	Another explanation was that the Prime Minister wanted a relative lightweight who would not find the new thrust on foreign policy obtrusive.

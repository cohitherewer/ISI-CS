          CHRIS IRVINE                            Einstein                                  
	London, Oct. 10: Oscar Wrigley, a two-year-old with the same IQ as Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking, has become the youngest boy in Britain to be accepted into Mensa, a society of high-IQ people.         
	Assessors at the Gifted Childrens Information Centre in Solihull in the UK said Oscar, with an IQ of at least 160, was one of the brightest children they had ever come across.         
	He has been ranked in the 99.99th percentile of the population and has been ranked off the scale as the Stanford-Binet test cannot measure higher than 160.         
	Oscars father Joe, 29, an IT specialist from Reading in Berkshire, said: Oscar was recently telling my wife about the reproductive cycle of penguins.         
	He is always asking questions. Every parent likes to think their child is special but we knew there was something particularly remarkable about Oscar. Im fully expecting the day to come when he turns around and tells me Im an idiot.         
	Oscars mother, Hannah, 26, told The Daily Mail: He amazes everyone. We knew at 12 weeks he was extremely bright. He was unusually alert.         
	Hannah, a housewife, added: His vocabulary is amazing. Hes able to construct complex sentences.         
	The other day he said to me, Mummy, sausages are like a party in my mouth.         
	Dr Peter Congdon, who assessed Oscar, said he was a child of very superior intelligence.         
	His abilities fall well within the range sometimes referred to as intellectually gifted. He demonstrated outstanding ability, he said.         
	John Stevenage, Mensas chief executive, confirmed Oscar had been accepted aged two years, five months and 11 days.         
	Oscar shows great potential. Converting that potential to achievement is the challenge for his parents and we are delighted that they have chosen to join the Mensa network for support, he said.         
	The youngest British child to join Mensa is Elise Tan Roberts, from Edmonton, North London, at two years, four months and 14 days, with an IQ of 156.

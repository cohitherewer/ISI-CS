The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Headmaster Chawla cracks whip
                                                                                                           Headmaster Chawla cracks whip
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Guwahati, March 24: The Election Commission today pulled up superintendents of police and deputy commissioners, even replacing two of them for unsatisfactory progress in the execution of non-bailable warrants, making preventive arrests and organising the collection of licenced arms in various districts of Assam.         
	At a meeting with the chief electoral officer of Assam, deputy commissioners, returning officers, IGPs, DIGs and SPs, election commissioner Navin Chawla took stock of the measures being taken to execute the poll panels standing directive to prevent misuse of arms and putting criminals behind bars.         
	Later this evening, Karimganj deputy commissioner Bhupendranath Sar-ma was replaced by M. Angamuthu and Morigaon SP Madan Chetia was replaced by Arabinda Kalita on the directive of the Election Commission.        
	Sources told The Telegraph that most of the districts have failed to execute the directives properly, inviting the wrath of the commissioner. Chawla was particularly harsh on Karimganj and Hailakandi district administrations and asked the two SPs to submit the progress reports on executing the directive to the commission on a daily basis.         
	The commission asked the district returning officers to strictly implement the model code of conduct and warned that it would not tolerate any lapses on their part. He (Chawla) shouted at us like a headmaster. But the problem is that after the elections we will be at the mercy of our political bosses again and the Election Commission will not be there to protect our confidential report, said an SP.         
	Later talking to reporters, Chawla said the commission would adopt zero tolerance for any violation of code of conduct. He said three observers would be deployed for each parliamentary constituency. Apart from that, micro observers, too, would be deputed at all sensitive polling stations.         
	On the concern of the political parties about the possibilities of EVMs being tampered with by the state government-owned Amtron, which has been entrusted with the responsibility of maintaining the machines, the commission reassured the political parties that the EVMs were tamper-proof.         
	The commission has, however, taken serious note of the Oppositions allegation of violation of the model code of conduct by chief minister Tarun Gogoi. Chawla said the commission would sit in New Delhi on Thursday to look into the allegation.         
	The Opposition had accused Gogoi of clubbing his official visit to Calcutta recently to raise funds for the party. Chawla also ruled out deferment of elections in Silchar, Karimganj and North Cachar Hills in view of Bihu and Poila Baishakh from April 16 to 19 because of security reasons.         
	He said adequate time is required for the movement of security forces and so the elections could not be deferred for the three seats. In reply to a query, he said in Assam there are 1.56 lakh doubtful voters who would not be allowed to exercise their franchise.         
	The commission also reviewed the poll preparedness in Meghalaya. Chawla expressed satisfaction over the fact that the state had issued photo identity cards to all voters.        
	Cong campaign        
	AICC president Sonia Gandhi and her son and AICC general secretary Rahul Gandhi will campaign for the Congress in Nagaland.         
	Disclosing this, convenor of the Nagaland PCC Election Coordination Committee K.L. Chishi said the committee had requested the Congress president to address a rally in Tuensang and Rahul Gandhi in Dimapur.         
	They are likely to campaign for Congress candidate Asungba Sangtam in the first week of April.

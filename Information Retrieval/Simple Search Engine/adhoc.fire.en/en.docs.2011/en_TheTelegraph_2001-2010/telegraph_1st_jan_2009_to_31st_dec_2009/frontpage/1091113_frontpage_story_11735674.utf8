  - Hus aide puts off India trip amid duel over Dalai Lama          JAYANTH JACOB                      Hu Jintao rsquo;s aide Zhou Yongkang                                
	New Delhi, Nov. 12: Beijing has postponed the November 16-20 tour of India by President Hu Jintaos key troubleshooter, Zhou Yongkang, amid the verbal duels over the Dalai Lamas trip to Arunachal Pradesh, sources said.        
	No fresh dates have been mentioned so far for Zhous visit.        
	Indian officials said the rescheduling of the visit was a routine affair and cited the mutually convenient date excuse, but Beijings decision follows a Chinese allegation that the Dalai Lama was visiting Tawang under pressure from New Delhi.        
	Zhou, a member of the Chinese Communist Partys politburo, has a role in shaping Beijings legal, legislative and security agendas. He oversaw security for the Beijing Olympics and was sent to Xinjiang last July by Hu to deal with the ethnic violence there.        
	He was expected to meet government officials as well as leaders of major political parties, including CPM general secretary Prakash Karat and his CPI counterpart A.B. Bardhan. He also wanted to meet top Congress and BJP leaders, and to visit Calcutta and Bangalore.        
	Last Monday, a day after the Dalai Lama arrived in Tawang on a weeklong visit, the Beijing-based Global Times had quoted an unnamed Chinese scholar as saying: India may have forgotten the lesson of 1962, when its repeated provocation resulted in military clashes. India is on this wrong track again.        
	The newspaper had quoted another Chinese analyst as saying that the Dalai Lamas visit to the area, which China calls southern Tibet, had come under pressure from India.        
	In Delhi, junior foreign minister Shashi Tharoor denied the allegation. He told the India Economic Summit on Monday: The Dalai Lama is free to travel anywhere in India. I have not heard (that) the suggestion (for the visit) comes from us as we do not deal with the spiritual travels of spiritual leaders. He has to visit his flock as he sees fit.        
	Last month, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had told Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao that he would not bar the Dalai Lama from travelling to Arunachal Pradesh and that the monk was an honoured guest.        
	He had, however, stressed that New Delhi did not allow Tibetans to do politics from Indian soil.

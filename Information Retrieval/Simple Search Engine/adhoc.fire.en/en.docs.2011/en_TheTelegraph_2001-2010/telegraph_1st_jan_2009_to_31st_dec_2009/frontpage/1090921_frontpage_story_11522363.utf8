The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Broken by boss amp; bulb, a flicker after 40 years 
                                                                                                           Broken by boss amp; bulb, a flicker after 40 years 
          G.C. SHEKHAR                             Kanagarathinam and his wife                                  
	Chennai, Sept. 20: A constable who had to work as a day labourer after being dismissed for allegedly stealing a fused bulb over 40 years ago has been granted a monthly pension of Rs 2,050.        
	Tamil Nadu deputy chief minister M.K. Stalins office cleared the pension for K. Kanagarathinam last week, eight years after the state administrative tribunal termed his sacking unreasonable but couldnt reinstate him as he was already past 60 at the time of the order.        
	The money will hardly compensate what the now 74-year-old ex-cop has lost  his job, benefits and, most of all, his dignity. The bulb he was accused of stealing by his boss, a Chennai inspector, in 1968 was then worth 25 paise.         
	The tribunal had said the punishment was highly disproportionate to the flimsy charges.        
	Since Kanagarathinam had worked only five years as a constable, he was entitled to a monthly pension of Rs 500. But considering the circumstances of his dismissal and the poverty of his family, a (higher) amount (Rs 2,050) was sanctioned as a special case, said an officer in Stalins office.         
	Kanagarathinams troubles began in 1968, after he was transferred from Coimbatore to the office of the Chennai IG. There, he applied for leave to visit his pregnant wife, but inspector R. Bhargovan, demanded a bribe. Kanagrathniam not only refused but also spread the word around.         
	Bhargovan called me one day to his office, gave me a fused light bulb and asked me to throw it in the dustbin. When I stepped out, I was surrounded by a few of my colleagues and was accused of stealing the bulb. I was suspended for three months, Kanagarathinam said.        
	At the inquiry that followed, all the colleagues and Bhargovan deposed against him, leading to his dismissal. All my appeals to higher officials were blocked by Bhargovan. My wife was so upset she suffered a miscarriage.         
	In 1987, Kanagarathinam moved the tribunal, and though the case dragged on for 14 years with officials extending little co-operation and witnesses not turning up, he eventually succeeded in 2001.        
	Since tribunal couldnt reinstate him or order compensation because of his age, it left the matter to the government. It observed that Kanagarathinam was a victim of an ongoing rivalry between Tamils and Malayalees  Bhargovan was a Malayalee  in the Chennai IGs office.         
	Kanagarathinam, who married off his daughter with his meagre earnings as a labourer, agreed the money has come too late but said it would help him make ends meet. This will be a huge help as I am old. One of my two sons is physically challenged.

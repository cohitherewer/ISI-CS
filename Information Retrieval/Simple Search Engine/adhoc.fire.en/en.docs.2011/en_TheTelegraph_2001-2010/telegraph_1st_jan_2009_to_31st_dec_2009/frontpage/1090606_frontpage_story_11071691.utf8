The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Women race against poison 
                                                                                                           Women race against poison 
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, June 5: The Centre today began a race against the clock to pass the womens reservation bill, ideally in the next 99 days, but one of the legislations opponents underscored the hurdles by threatening to kill himself.        
	Janata Dal (United) MP Sharad Yadav told the Lok Sabha that if the government tried to force the bill through, he would consume poison and die here. ( )        
	A senior government source said we might not be able to meet the deadline for the passage of the bill, which requires a constitutional amendment.        
	The Presidents address to Parliament yesterday said the Centre would initiate steps within the next hundred days for early passage of the bill, which the source interpreted as a commitment to pass the bill within that period.        
	Assuming the interpretation is correct, the government has time till September 12. But the budget session is expected to end in early August, giving the Centre about eight weeks rather than 100 days. A special session (before the winter session) is unlikely to be called since Assembly polls in Maharashtra are expected in September-October.        
	To pass the bill in the budget session, likely to begin in end-June, the Centre needs to fast-track several complicated procedures. It took the first step today, sounding out various political parties about putting in place a standing committee of law and justice on the bill.        
	The 31-member panel will study the report of its outgoing predecessor and come up with its own report, which will be referred to the law ministry. The ministry will rework the bill and send it to the cabinet. Only after a cabinet nod can it be placed in Parliament.        
	All this within three weeks. Then the bill has to be tabled in the Lok Sabha and again in the Rajya Sabha. The government then has a little over a month to pass the bill along with the budget.        
	But even the first step, forming a House standing committee, is complicated. Memberships of these panels have become a way of extending patronage to MPs left out of ministry berths, so the exercise involves jockeying.        
	The head of the outgoing committee, Congress Rajya Sabha member E.M. Sudarsana Natchiappan, said his panel was almost through with its report. We are at the tail-end. We only have to get evidence (depositions of panchayats, womens groups) from the Northeast. The new committee will just have to give the finishing touches.        
	In Parliament, where the BJP and the Left have pledged support, the bill has more than the two-thirds majority it needs  as it had in the previous House. Yet, what may be a hurdle  like before  is the possibility of pandemonium by its opponents such as the Dal (United), Samajwadi Party and the Rashtriya Janata Dal, making voting impossible.        
	These parties want a sub-quota for OBCs and minority women. Mayavati has not spelt out her position but is believed to be wooing OBCs and might oppose the bill.

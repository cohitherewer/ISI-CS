          DEVADEEP PUROHIT                                        Suman      
	Calcutta, Nov. 17: Kabir Suman today said he would skip the Parliament session that starts on Thursday and was seriously considering quitting the Trinamul Congress and his post of MP.        
	The singer told The Telegraph he was disappointed with Mamata Banerjee for calling him a guest in the party after his public outburst about Trinamul officials coming in the way of development in his constituency, Jadavpur.        
	It was the word guest that triggered his thoughts of resigning from party and post, said Suman, who will make up his mind after consulting Mamata, Speaker Meira Kumar and the parliamentary affairs ministry.        
	I dont know how an otherwise wonderful leader like Mamata Banerjee can call an elected MP a guest. I find it surprising, said Suman, who has cancelled his plan to travel to Delhi tomorrow for Parliaments winter session.        
	Instead of addressing the impediments to development caused by local Trinamul functionaries, I have been called a guest. So, I am seriously reconsidering my continuance as a Trinamul MP.        
	On Sunday, Suman had alleged that some party officials in South 24-Parganas wanted to use his MPs development funds according to their will.        
	I fought against the CPM during the elections. After that I got busy fighting local Trinamul leaders, who were clamouring for my MPLAD funds. I tried to pass on the message to Mamata through party leaders like Mukul Roy and Purnendu Bose, but the problems persisted, he said today.        
	The first-time MP said he had so far received half his annual quota of Rs 2 crore to spend on his constituency, and was using it to get 44 deep tube-wells installed.        
	Work is on in Kheyada II gram panchayat behind Ruby General Hospital, but the local leaders want the funds to go to them. Similarly, Im having problems in Baruipur because of local Trinamul leaders. I have realised that contesting the election was a mistake, Suman said.        
	He said he feared physical attacks from a section of Trinamul leaders. He also accused the Centre of planning a war against tribals in the garb of a crackdown on Maoists.

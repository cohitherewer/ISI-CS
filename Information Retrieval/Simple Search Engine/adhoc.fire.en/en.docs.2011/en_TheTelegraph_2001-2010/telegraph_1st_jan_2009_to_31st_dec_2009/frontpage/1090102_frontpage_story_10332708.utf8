          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Siliguri, Jan. 1: A 13-year-old girl of Delhi Public School here was found hanging at her flat in Deshbandhupara this morning.         
	Sayari Bose, the Class VII student, was a boarder and had come home at Ramesh Majumdar Sarani for Christmas vacation. Her father Rana Bose, a timber merchant who lost his wife a year ago, and relatives said they did not know what could have prompted the girl to kill herself.        
	Yesterday night, we spotted her at Deshbandhupara, looking dazed. She could not identify her house. After that, through Joy Chakraborty, the councillor of Ward 29 where she resides, we managed to contact one of her relatives who came to the police station and took her home, said Prabhat Chakraborty, the inspector-in-charge of the Siliguri police station.         
	Later, at 12 noon, we came to know that the girl has committed suicide. Her body has been sent to North Bengal Medical College and Hospital for post-mortem, the police officer said.         
	The relative, who did not want to divulge his name, said: When the councillor informed us, I went there and brought her at my residence. She spent the night at my house. This morning, her father came and took her back home. I dont have any clue what went wrong and what forced her to commit suicide.        
	According to neighbours and relatives, Bose runs a timber shop in Deshbandhupara. His son Santayans works at an IT firm in Calcutta.        
	We have informed him and he has started for Siliguri, said one of Santayans friends. His sister, so far we know, was a good student and used to stay at the schools hostel. She had come home for Christmas.

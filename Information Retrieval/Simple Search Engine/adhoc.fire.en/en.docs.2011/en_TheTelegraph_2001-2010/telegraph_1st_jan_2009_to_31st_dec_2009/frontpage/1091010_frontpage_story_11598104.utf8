  - Former cabinet colleagues also face probe          OUR BUREAU                                          
	Ranchi/New Delhi, Oct. 9: The enforcement directorate (ED) has booked former chief minister Madhu Koda and three of his erstwhile cabinet colleagues for alleged money laundering and diversion of state funds.        
	Koda, who hogged headlines for becoming the first Independent MLA to head a government in Jharkhand, now becomes the first chief minister against whom an Enforcement Case Information Report or ECIR (the equivalent of an FIR) has been filed by the enforcement directorate.        
	Former ministers in his team who have also been similarly booked were Kamlesh Singh, Bhanu Pratap Shahi and Bandhu Tirkey  all of whom, along with the ex-chief minister, have been accused of amassing assets worth hundreds of crores of rupees, foreign exchange violations and illegal overseas investments.        
	A source in the Union finance ministry said the case against Koda and the others was registered on Friday after a six-month investigation during which the ED got several leads that led to a widening of the ambit of the probe.        
	The ED, sources added, took the help of more than one international agency before registering the case. Now, it will involve other agencies in India, including the state police, as it digs deeper.        
	Tirkey, the former HRD minister, admitted that an ECIR had been filed against him by the ED. I shall file a counter FIR against the enforcement directorate if within the next seven days, they fail to prove that I have a flat in Delhi and acres of land at Banhora in Ranchi district  I, too, want to see for myself where the flat and the land is located, he told The Telegraph.         
	Koda could not be reached despite repeated efforts.         
	The ED has also lodged cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act against two other former ministers, Anosh Ekka and Harinarayan Rai. The state vigilance bureau has already filed chargesheets against them. Both Ekka and Rai are currently lodged at Birsa Munda Central Jail, Ranchi.                                
	The ED has also moved the vigilance court to take both Ekka and Rai on remand for questioning. The case is scheduled to come up for hearing on October 12.         
	High-level sources in the state police revealed that soon after FIRs were lodged on July 2 against Koda and three of his cabinet colleagues  Singh, Shahi and Tirkey  and raids conducted on their residences by the state vigilance department on July 24, the ED sought the vigilance bureaus help in its own investigations on money laundering.         
	The ED, sources added, had already obtained copies of vital documents seized by the state vigilance department probing disproportionate assets cases filed against the four  all of whom have been charged under the Prevention of Corruption Act as well as under various provisions of IPC related to cheating, criminal conspiracy and criminal breach of trust.         
	The ED had sought our co-operation and we have agreed to help them, IG (vigilance) M.V. Rao said.         
	The vigilance department has also decided to seek CBI help to probe the overseas links of Koda and other former ministers. The deputy IG (vigilance), V.K. Pandey, said the CBI would be moved as it was the only agency recognised by Interpol to carry out investigations beyond the shores of this country.

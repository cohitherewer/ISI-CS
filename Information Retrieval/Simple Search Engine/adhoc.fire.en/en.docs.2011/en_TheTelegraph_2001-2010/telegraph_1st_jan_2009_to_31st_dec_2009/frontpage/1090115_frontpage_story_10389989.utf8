	The last time I wrote in these columns, I had mentioned the emergence of the Southern Circle, radius about one km (as the crow flies), centre at Triangular Park, which has become a serious food destination in the city, with a large number of value-for-money, middle to up-market stand-alone restaurants serving just about every kind of cuisine known to be available in Calcutta.  
	You can expect polite and efficient service from liveried waiters, air-conditioning, clean and well-appointed surroundings and, in some cases, expert savvy when it comes to aesthetics and presentation as well. I have always been a Park Street loyalist, but there is no doubt that now I can just walk a few blocks and get just about everything, satisfaction guaranteed.  
	Here is a list of places I know of. Not the most correct, comprehensive and up-to-date list Im sure, but I love making lists.  
	Taajas, Soi 19, Red Hot Chilli Pepper, Tamarind, Kurry Klub, Marco Polo, Silver Oak (two branches), The Wall, Banana Leaf, Sharey Chuattor, Mandarin, Spices and Sauces, Charcoal, Tero Parbon, T2 Wok and Grill, Krystal Chopsticks, Indthalia (three branches), China Bowl, Bhojohori Manna (two outlets), Bistro, Hatari, 6 Ballygunge Place and last but certainly not least, and subject of todays piece, The Restaurant On The First Floor, 50/1B Purna Das Road.  
	When someone  Sanchita Bhattacharjee Alam aka Chef Sunshine, to be precise  becomes a Grand Diplome in French Cuisine and Pastissiere from Le Cordon Bleu, London, and gains her credentials in Italian cuisine from La Cucina Caldesi, what sort of restaurant would you expect her to open?  
	A full-fledged, mainstream, mainly north Indian restaurant? Paneer, Makai, Palak, Machhi, Murgh, Jhinga and Gosht. Unlikely, but thats exactly what Chef Sunshine did. (With some favourite nuggets from the south). I couldnt forget my Indian palate, she says simply.  
	Reading through the menu gave me a rare sense of satisfaction. A compact selection of righteous items under each category and for a change a team of people working towards perfecting a single cuisine.  
	Hare Matar Ke Shammi Kebab was the first item, a starter. Peas and chickpeas are taken in a 3:1 ratio, boiled and roughly mashed. Chopped ginger and garlic, kasuri methi (a relative of fenugreek), cardamom, ground garam masala and flakes of dry red chillies are mixed into the mash, which is then shaped into rounds, batter coated and shallow fried on a griddle.   
	Mahi Galouti, another starter, is an interesting item because Chef has used techniques picked up at Le Cordon Bleu for a very Indian item! Bekti fillets are boiled and then flaked before being combined with chopped ginger and garlic, ground garam masala, coriander seeds, green chillies and salt. They are then shaped, batter-coated and deep-fried. The boiling and flaking gives the fish a squeaky, chewy texture which I rather liked.   
	Patthar Ke Kebab, also a starter, is traditionally a kebab prepared by nomadic folk by cooking thoroughly marinated and then sliced and pounded goat meat on heated marble slabs. Simple, robust and delicious.   
	The two main course dishes I had were also traditional classics  Maans Panjara, the celebrated Rajasthani Lal Maans; succulent goat meat cubes marinated and cooked in a tandoor and the simmered in a mouth-watering gravy in which onions, tomatoes, meat stock, red chillies and spices are the main ingredients. And Zameen Doi Machli, an Awadhi speciality in which thick, chunky fillets of bekti are cooked in a rich, thick gravy.  
	An honest menu, with no attempt to be over esoteric. A wide choice of traditional spreads, and very tastefully presented  a mark of Le Cordon Bleu, which is again visible in the innovative dessert item Gajar Halwa Tart.   
	For me, a top class Indian restaurant, a stones throw away.

	Ranchi, July 26: Hundred per cent  and no less  transparency in governance is what Kateekal Sankaranarayanan pledged as he was sworn in the seventh governor of Jharkhand this morning.        
	Chief Justice of Jharkhand High Court Gyan Sudha Misra administered the oath of office to Sankaranarayanan at 11.30am. Natty in a cream Nehru coat, the new governor said he had been a politician for long and knew well how to make a laggard bureaucracy work. I will meet all state officials in the next couple of days. There will be nothing to hide during my tenure. Total transparency and administrative acumen will be the mantras for good governance, he said.         
	Sending a strong message that corruption would not be tolerated in the state that was under Presidents rule, Sankaranarayanan said: My priority will be to help the people. All-round rural development, streamlining the public distribution system and improving the power scenario will top Raj Bhavans agenda, he said.         
	The 76-year-old Congressman from Kerala, who has had held several ministerial portfolios in the K. Karunakaran government during 1977-78 and important posts between 2001 and 2004 under A.K. Antony, said he needed some time and co-operation from the people and the media to make the state of affairs here take a U-turn. Stating that he was new to Jharkhand, the seasoned statesman said he would begin work from today with an administrative purpose.         
	Sankaranarayanan, however, minced no words to say that he had was always in favour of an elected government and had ensured polls in Nagaland within two-and-a-half months of Presidents rule. The Centre has also made it clear that it wants elections in Jharkhand after monsoon.         
	The new governor said he was a humble man with no reservations and hoped for positive interaction with the public, the media and officials for best results.         
	In his maiden 20-minute address to the media, he said that he was here to help the people and do whatever is needed to be done.         
	Union food processing minister Subodh Kant Sahay, BJP Lok Sabha MP Yashwant Sinha, JMM Rajya Sabha MP Hemant Soren and state BJP president Raghubar Das graced the occasion. State chief secretary A.K. Basu, cabinet secretary P.K. Jojoria, tourism secretary A.K. Singh and other senior officials were also present at the swearing-in.        
	Presidents rule was imposed in Jharkhand on January 19 this year amid political uncertainty in the wake of the Tamar by-election defeat of former chief minister Shibu Soren. Sankaranarayanan, who has been serving as governor of Nagaland since February 3, 2007, replaced Syed Sibtey Razi, who was transferred to Assam.         
	The new governor is expected to visit Project Building, the state secretariat, tomorrow and hold a review meeting with senior bureaucrats. Today, he held informal meetings with senior state leaders during an extended high tea session soon after the swearing-in.

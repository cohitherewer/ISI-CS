The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Helmet to halt heady ride
                                                                                                           Helmet to halt heady ride
  - Power to send alerts and prevent drink trips           G.C. SHEKHAR                             IIT students Rajan Gupta and Mohit Mittal with the helmet, Techmet                                        
	Chennai, Sept. 29: From outside, it looks alike any normal helmet. But the technology it packs can save lives and prevent a drunken rider from starting a bike.        
	Techmet, designed by two students of IIT Madras, is a helmet that can send an SMS alert about the GPS co-ordinates of the rider in the event of a crash.        
	In case the rider has downed a peg too many, a breathalyzer will not let the bike be started. The helmet cannot be dumped either as the bike will start only if the rider is wearing the headgear.        
	The helmet will be among dozens of innovations that will be unveiled at the IIT Madras annual techfest, Shaasthra 2009, this week.         
	The idea came from laptops whose hard drives can lock when the machine is accidentally dropped. An in-built accelerometer that detects the sudden increase in speed does the job. Similarly, an accelerometer fixed inside the helmet triggers a signal in case of sudden impact. This makes the GPS device inside the helmet relay to the riders mobile phone (through a Bluetooth transmitter) his co-ordinates which are relayed from the mobile as an SMS to emergency services and relatives, said Rajan Gupta, one of the inventors and a third-year student of electrical engineering.        
	The alert could be a pre-worded text message like Your relative/friend met with an accident at these co-ordinates showing the latitude and longitude.        
	If the receivers mobile is GPS-enabled, it can convert the co-ordinates to flash the exact location of the rider.We are planning to refine this system by feeding the important locations of the city in the helmets GPS so it can relay the name of the location directly, Gupta said.        
	The circuit board, the GPS, Bluetooth, accelerometer and the battery are packed between the outer shell of the helmet and its inner thermocol lining so as not to intrude with the essential safety requirements of the helmet.        
	Asked if the circuit will withstand the impact, Mohit Mital, a second-year student of engineering design and co-inventor, said they had opted for components capable of withstanding shock and temperature.         
	Also, the circuit gets activated only when the helmet is worn. So the system does not act in case the helmet is accidentally dropped. Similarly, only if the helmet is worn and after the alcohol detector ensures that the riders alcohol level is beneath the threshold limit, will the bike start. For this, the bikes ignition system needs to be connected to a Bluetooth device, Mittal said.         
	The two students took over five months to design and perfect the device, having to source most of the components from abroad.        
	It cost us about Rs 12,000 but if the helmet gets mass-produced, the bill can be brought down to Rs 6,000, said Gupta.        
	The IIT is helping the two to get a patent, said M. Govardhan, the dean of the students.

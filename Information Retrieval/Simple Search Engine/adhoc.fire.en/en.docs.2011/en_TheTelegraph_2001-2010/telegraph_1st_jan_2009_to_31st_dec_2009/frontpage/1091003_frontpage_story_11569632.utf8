  - Faced with MNS Mumbai diktat, KJo apologises           OUR BUREAU                      Johar arrives to meet Thackeray. (Fotocorp)                                
	Oct. 2: Uncle then, nephew now. Mani Ratnam then, KJo now.        
	The names may have changed but most of Indias cine czars still shudder at the mention of the C-word: avoid controversies even if that means yielding to political demands.        
	Workers of the Raj Thackeray-led Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) brought Bollywood to its knees after going around Mumbai shutting down theatres screening Wake Up Sid, the latest offering from Karan Johar.        
	Their wrath was directed against calling the city Bombay as opposed to Mumbai  the name preferred by regional parties of Maharashtra.        
	As a nervous Johar, known as KJo, rushed to Rajs residence to offer an unconditional apology and request for time to correct the faux pas, the Maharashtrian leader decided to send out a blanket message to the entire film industry.        
	There are many cities in India whose names have been changed. And yet, no one refers to Chennai as Madras, or Thiruvananthapuram as Trivandrum. So why should Mumbai be different? The director has realised his mistake and says he will correct it by adding a slide apologising for it. This will take a few days and after it happens I want to see a preview of the modified film. The film should not be obstructed from being screened till then. I will also write a letter to the film producers association, the film industry should confer and take a formal decision not to refer to Mumbai by any other name henceforth in any film, Thackeray said.        
	The MNS leader, who is believed to have given Johar a severe dressing down, has given the producer, among Bollywoods biggest, three to four days to correct the mistake. Bombay is mentioned several times, with the films lead pair, Ranbir Kapoor and Konkona Sen Sharma, referring to the city by its old name.        
	Raj Saheb has also told Karan Johar in no uncertain terms that he should spread the word among all producers under the umbrella of Indian Motion Pictures Producers Association, to which Karan belongs, that Bollywood cannot use Bombay to denote Mumbai. They will face the same treatment if they do not fall in line, said MNS leader Shirish Parker.        
	No Bollywood producer was willing to comment. Even the producers association spokesperson refused to speak.        
	TV reports quoted Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavan as saying that Johar should have approached the police instead of meeting Thackeray.        
	By raking up the issue, Raj has hijacked the role thus far performed by uncle Bal Thackeray. The Shiv Sena chief had arrogated to himself the role of Mumbais conscience-keeper and keep tabs on activities considered un-Mumbaiker.        
	Mani Ratnam would know. The celebrated director had to agree to cuts in his 1995 film Bombay, based on the 1992-93 riots, because of objections raised by the senior Thackeray who did not agree with the tenor of the movie and the way in which he had been depicted. Bombay was allowed in cinemas only after Bal Thackeray gave his nod after a preview incorporating the cuts.        
	Johar too will follow suit. His Dharma Productions and UTV, their partner for Wake Up Sid, will now carry a disclaimer before the movie saying that Bombay was used inadvertently to mean Mumbai.        
	It was a genuine mistake on our part... henceforth, we will use Mumbai instead of Bombay. We have apologised for the same, Johar told reporters after meeting Raj Thackeray at his Shivaji Park residence.        
	As of now, the producers have been spared the arduous task of re-dubbing because Bombay is mentioned several times. Initially, they (MNS leaders) demanded a re-dubbing but Karan Johar said it was not possible. We will carry a disclaimer, said Nilufer Qureshi, spokesperson for Dharma Productions.        
	Gerson da Cunha, a Mumbai-based activist and commentator, said the attack of self-styled guardians of culture and morality on Bollywood films was an exercise in competitive chauvinism and sectarianism.        
	It is a sign of the gradual diminishing of the collective conscience of what was once an international city. Today thanks to these goons, Mumbai has morphed into another backwater parochial town, he said.        
	But not just in Mumbai, cinema, the feature film industry across the world is vulnerable to such attacks. In this country, more so because of lack of active policing. Bollywood has a history of succumbing to pressure of every kind. Creative people cannot take on goondas. Remember, these people even hounded out M.F. Husain, said Da Cunha.        
	Thackeray juniors supporters are not complaining though at what they see as a masterstroke by their leader.         
	In one move, Rajsaheb has grabbed the mantle of the most robust Marathi voice from Maharashtra. For long Balasaheb has been the undisputed leader of the Marathi manoos. But he is ageing and his health is frail. Before the Assembly elections, he is becoming nervous and attacking Raj relentlessly. Raj has been quiet because though a political rival, Balasaheb is after all his uncle and one-time political mentor. Now he has hit back and Karan Johars film provided the right platform, said a close aide of the MNS chief.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Marandi feels Lalu pulse
                                                                                                           Marandi feels Lalu pulse

	Ranchi, July 20: Cold-shouldered by Congress that seems reluctant to sever ties with JMM, Babulal Marandi is now looking to Lalu Prasad as an ally keeping the upcoming Assembly elections in mind.        
	Though Marandi, MP from Koderma, extended support to the Manmohan Singh government, the Congresss unwillingness in snapping ties with Shibu Soren-led Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) has made the former chief minister seriously consider forging closer ties with Lalu Prasads RJD.         
	Marandi hasnt made any effort to hide his unhappiness with the Congress for keeping the state Assembly House under suspended animation, primarily as a ploy to keep the JMM in good humour.         
	 The RJD is also on the hunt for a new ally, now that its relationship with both the Congress and the JMM have been strained. A possible tie-up between the two parties was discussed at a closed-door meeting between Marandi and the state RJD president, Gautam Sagar Rana, in Giridih on July 17.        
	The JVM general secretary, Pradeep Yadav, also met Lalu Prasad in New Delhi yesterday and discussed the possibility of an alliance _ recently both parties have spoken out in the same voice on issues concerning Jharkhand.        
	 Marandi denied his party was looking for a tie-up with the RJD. We are gearing up to fight elections on our own, he asserted. But, Yadav conceded discussions for a possible tie-up were on with the RJD.        
	 Rana said the RJDs first choice would be UPA partners. But we are not sure UPA will remain united. So, we may go for new friends during elections. Marandi, too, cannot win elections on his own, he told The Telegraph.         
	 With the RJD having contested the Lok Sabha elections in Bihar and Jharkhand outside the UPA, there are doubts whether Lalu Prasads party would be considered a part of the alliance once Assembly polls were held, possibly in October-November.        
	Marandi was also wooing political heavyweights. Today, Bokaro strongman Samresh Singh formally joined the party. And former ministers Ram Chandra Kesri and Madhu Singh and former Deoghar MLA Deoghar Suresh Paswan were also likely to join soon.         
	The BJP held a meeting of office-bearers to chalk out plans for the Assembly elections and decided to make Governor Syed Sibtey Razis tenure during the last six months of presidents rule as its election plank.        
	The Congress was also expected to hold a meeting next month to plan its strategy for the polls in Maharashtra, Haryana, Jharkhand and Arunachal Pradesh.

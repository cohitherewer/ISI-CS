The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Taunts to drumbeats: village hails victory
                                                                                                           Taunts to drumbeats: village hails victory
          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                            Pinki before leaving for Los Angeles                                  
	Feb. 23: Shimla Devi, 32, doesnt know whether to laugh or cry. Drumbeats are echoing around her mud house, with Rampur Dabahi celebrating the Oscar for Smile Pinki as if its the villagers own victory.                  
	I dont know how to react. These same villagers scorned my daughter as a cursed child. Now they are dancing to drumbeats to celebrate her victory, says the mother of Pinki Sonkar, 8, the subject of the 39-minute film.        
	Like Slumdog Millionaire, this documentary by a western filmmaker too deals with a poor Indian childs journey from despair to hope  but Pinkis story is real-life, set in a backward Uttar Pradesh village, 70km from Varanasi.        
	Megan Mylans film tells of how the girl was stigmatised as a honthkata (one with a split lip) because she was born with a cleft lip, and how surgery changed her life.        
	It was at 9am this morning that Shimla learnt from a relative the film had won the Oscar for Best Documentary (Short). She doesnt have a TV and her labourer husband Rajendra is in Los Angeles with Pinki and Mylan.        
	By 10am, the village was crawling with huge broadcast vans and cars, mobiles were ringing constantly and villagers were dancing to drumbeats before the cameras.        
	The publicity after the Oscar nomination had already had the village of 2,300 people abuzz. Last night, prayers for the films success were held in Rampur Dabahi, whose taunts had once led Pinki to stop going to school and start looking after the cattle at home.        
	She would often hide in a corner of her house, refusing to step out, said Annapurna Yadav, her teacher.        
	There was little the family  so poor that the seven children mostly slept on an empty stomach  could do. The parents cursed their luck that their second daughter should turn out to be one of Indias million-odd cleft-lip kids.        
	Hope came in the shape of the Smile Train, an NGO that corrects cleft lips, in December 2006 when Pinki was six. Dr Subodh Singh, a plastic surgeon, agreed to do the surgery free at Varanasis GS Memorial Hospital.        
	She was extremely co-operative during the operation. She couldnt wait to see her new look, Dr Singh said.        
	The jeers stopped and Pinki began going to school again. Yet the person who really transformed her daughters life, Shimla said, was the white woman with a camera who had accompanied Dr Singh to their house the very first day.        
	Mylan recorded every bit of conversation between Pinki and the doctors, and the details of her life before and after the operation.        
	It was as if the girl had been reborn after her operation, said Pradeep Vishwakarma, a panchayat leader. But it took us some time to reconcile the two pictures. Today shes so famous! We want both her family and our village to progress.        
	They will. The Mirzapur district administration today said it would give the village a facelift since it was now sure to draw foreign visitors.        
	Well adopt it as a model village, Mirzapur chief development officer Jaswant Singh said. Well build a concrete road up to the highway.        
	A brick house has been requisitioned in the village for Pinkis family. A hand pump will be installed. The state will fund Pinkis education.        
	This has been Gods gift to us, Shimla said, not specifying if she meant the surgery, the film or the Oscar.

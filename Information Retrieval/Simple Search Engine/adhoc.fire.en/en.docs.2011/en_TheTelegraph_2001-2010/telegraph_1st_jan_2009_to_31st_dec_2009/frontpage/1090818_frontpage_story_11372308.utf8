	Ranchi, Aug. 17: Having been on the run for nearly two months now, former ministers Anosh Ekka and Harinarayan Rai finally gave in to the law today, surrendering before the special (vigilance) court thats hearing disproportionate assets cases worth crores against them.        
	The court of Binoy Kant Khan, which had issued non-bailable arrest warrants against the two on June 27, sent them to judicial custody for 14 days. Both Ekka, the former rural development minister, and Rai, the former urban development minister, have been lodged in Birsa Munda Central Jail.        
	Vigilance proceedings have been lodged against several other high-profile politicians, including a former chief minister. But, Ekka and Rai are the first among them to surrender.        
	The others, who have had their premises raided by the vigilance department, include former chief minister Madhu Koda, former food and civil supplies minister Kamlesh Singh, former health minister Bhanu Pratap Shahi and former human resource development minister Bandhu Tirkey.         
	While sending the two to the jail, Khan directed authorities to provide them proper medical assistance after Rai cited a spine problem and Ekka a heart condition.        
	Supreme Court lawyer R.K. Anand represented Ekka, while the surrender petition of Rai was moved by high court lawyer Anil Kumar. Naresh Kumar Sinha represented the vigilance bureau.        
	Todays surrenders are likely to act as a morale booster for the state vigilance bureau as it continues its probe on the other high-profile politicians.        
	We will be moving court for a vigilance remand of the two former ministers who were compelled to give themselves up today. Regarding the other disproportionate assets cases, we shall continue investigations with renewed vigour, inspector-general (vigilance) M.V. Rao told The Telegraph.        
	On October 25, 2008, an FIR was lodged against the two ex-ministers at the vigilance police station on the directive of the vigilance court while it was hearing a complaint filed by Giridih social worker Kumar Vinod. Later on June 27, the court was forced to issue non-bailable arrest warrants against them after they failed to provide information that was being sought and did not turn up for interrogation.                                
	While Ekka is alleged to have accumulated unaccounted for assets to the tune of Rs 3.73 crore, Rais disproportionate assets approximately total Rs 1.16 crore. A scrutiny of their bank accounts, too, revealed transactions worth several hundreds of crores.        
	The former ministers, who also floated construction companies in the names of their spouses to channel funds, were also being charged with attempting to tamper with evidence and intimidating witnesses.        
	Sources pointed out that the vigilance bureau would now step up efforts to gather evidence against Koda and three of his colleagues  Singh, Shahi and Tirkey.        
	Kodas associate Vinod Sinha, a businessman from the former chief ministers constituency of Singhbhum, has already been quizzed by the vigilance.        
	Vigilance had also sent out questionnaires to Tirkey, Shahi, and Singh seeking details of property owned by them and their spouses in addition to information on sources of funds.        
	While Koda, Shahi and Tirkey have already submitted details, Singh was yet to do so. A separate notice has been issued to him.

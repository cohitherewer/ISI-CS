The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Plea for poll force adds to IPL woes

	New Delhi, March 15: More bad news for the Indian Premier League as it waits for security clearance from the government.        
	The Election Commission today said it might need more security personnel, in addition to the 21 lakh it had earlier mentioned, for the Lok Sabha polls.        
	The election security requirements have already left states and the Centre struggling to find enough personnel for the IPL matches, hanging a cloud over the tournament.        
	We are not concerned with the IPL. Availability of forces (for the polls) is less this time compared with 2004, whereas (the need for) deployment is more, chief election commissioner N. Gopalaswami, flanked by election commissioners S.Y. Quraishi and Navin Chawla, told reporters.         
	We have an assessment that additional forces may be required. Wherever concerns are expressed, we shall seek more forces, he said.        
	Gopalaswamis comments came at the end of a two-day meeting with poll observers from across the country.        
	The need to balance the security requirements of the IPL and the general election, both scheduled for April-May, has already forced league organisers to shuffle match dates twice.        
	The Union home ministry has said that because of the polls, it cannot spare too many paramilitary personnel for the matches and that state governments must take responsibility for the leagues security.        
	However, many states have asked for a large contingent of central forces for the IPL matches or said they wouldnt be able to spare police for poll duty during the games. The Centre has rejected this.        
	Both central and state forces are deployed during elections, with each state required to send an earmarked number of personnel to the pool placed at the commissions disposal.        
	Gopalaswami said National Cadet Corps and NSS volunteers would be drafted in to maintain peace outside polling stations.        
	Some 2,500 observers will monitor the poll, when 71.4 crore Indians can cast their votes. For the first time, the observers will include Indian Forest Service officers and state Public Service Commission officials, Gopalaswami said.         
	They will be keeping an eye out for excessive spending by candidates.

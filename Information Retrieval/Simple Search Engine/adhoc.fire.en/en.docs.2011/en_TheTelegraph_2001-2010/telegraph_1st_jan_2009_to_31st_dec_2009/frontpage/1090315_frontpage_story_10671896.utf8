	Ranchi, March 14: Real estate financier Raj Kumar Dhanuka was gunned down this afternoon at a popular shopping complex on Kutchery Road, barely 500 metres from the office of the Ranchi superintendent of police, spreading fear and panic in the capital.         
	According to the police, Dhanuka (45) was leaving his office at the eight-storeyed Panchvati Plaza shopping complex around 2.15pm for lunch at his Kanke Road residence when two men called out his name.        
	As he turned, they pumped at least four bullets in his face and head from a sophisticated restricted bore (9mm) revolver apparently fitted with a silencer. Not many at the shopping complex, teaming with people on what was till then a lazy, uneventful Saturday afternoon, realised what was happening until they saw the 45-year-old businessman collapse on the floor.        
	According to eyewitnesses, Dhanuka lay semi-conscious, bleeding profusely. The police reached the complex soon and rushed him to the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS), but he succumbed to his injuries.        
	By then, word had spread and shops and other business establishments on Kutchery Road downed their shutters. The entire market area was deserted within half-an-hour of the incident.        
	In all probability, the duo appear to be professional hitmen. The capitals borders have been sealed. Checking and frisking are on, said Ranchi senior superintendent of police Praveen Kumar Singh.         
	Proprietor of Shivam Finance and Leasing Company, Dhanuka was said to be worth billions due to a flourishing empire in real estate, finance and coal trade.         
	He was a prominent member of the citys corporate and business circuit. He is survived by his wife Deepsikha, sons Aditya and Rahul and daughter Devika.        
	Dhanuka was also said to be close to the BJP. Former chief minister Arjun Munda  he is contesting the Jamshedpur seat on a BJP ticket  visited RIMS as soon as he heard of the incident.        
	This is terrible. Now the police should ensure the criminals are caught within 24 hours, he said.         
	SSP Singh said business rivalry appeared to be behind Dhanukas murder.         
	The police are exploring all angles while investigating the case, he said. Inspector-general of police (south Chhotanagpur zone) Rezi Dungdung also visited the shopping complex and RIMS.         
	The Federation of Jharkhand Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FJCCI) condemned the killing and issued a 24-hour deadline for the state police to nab the culprits. If the police fail, we will call a state capital bandh on Monday, March 16, said Anchal Kinger, the federations newly-appointed president.        
	Both the BJP and the Congress mourned Dhanukas death and condemned the brutal murder of the promising businessman.

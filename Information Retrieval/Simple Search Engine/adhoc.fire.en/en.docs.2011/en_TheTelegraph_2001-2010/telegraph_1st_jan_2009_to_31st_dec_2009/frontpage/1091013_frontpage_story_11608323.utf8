The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Sunny forecast on day of election
                                                                                                           Sunny forecast on day of election
  - Arunachal Pradesh readies to jump into verdict game          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                     
	Itanagar, Oct. 12: A sunny Arunachal Pradesh will go to the polls tomorrow, with the ruling Congress making a headstart, pocketing three seats without even a contest.        
	Three of the ruling Congresss candidates, including chief minister Dorjee Khandu, have already been declared winners uncontested to the 60-member Assembly.         
	For the first time, the Congress is contesting the elections under the leadership of Khandu who became the chief minister in a fashion predicable in this state.         
	A large number of legislators revolted against his predecessor Gegong Apang, leading to the fall of the veteran politician who had ruled the state for 23 years.         
	The party, which had won 34 seats under Apang, hopes to do better this time and is projecting a tally of 45-50 seats.         
	The partys campaign trail, however, was also far from satisfactory following cancellation of visits by MP Rahul Gandhi and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi because of bad weather.         
	However, the Met office has predicted clear, sunny skies tomorrow.         
	The key issue around which the campaign for this election has revolved is development, especially implementation  or the alleged lack of it  of the Rs 24,000 crore Prime Ministers package which includes sectors like communication network, education and healthcare.         
	PCC president Nabam Tuki, however, said: The Congress has put Arunachal Pradesh on the fast track of development in all sectors. The milestones achieved by the Congress over the past two-and-a-half years bear testimony to it.         
	The Opposition, on the other hand, has levelled charges of misuse of funds allotted under centrally sponsored schemes.         
	Its time to end the rule of Congress in the state, BJP general secretary Tai Tagak said.         
	It is the first time that the Trinamul Congress has joined the fray in the state with the party putting up 26 candidates, most of whom deserted the Congress after being denied tickets.         
	The Nationalist Congress Party, on the other hand, is contesting from 36 seats.         
	The Congress is likely to face the heat from the Trinamul Congress, besides the NCP, BJP, Peoples Party of Arunachal (PPA) and Janata Dal (United).         
	The deputy chief electoral officer, D. Bhattacharjee, said on the eve of the polls that the commission was taking measures to ensure free and fair polls.         
	Over the past two days, helicopters made over 100 sorties to land men and machines in some of the most remote polling stations in the country.         
	Though the authorities claim that a large number of security forces have been deployed to check untoward incidents, the suspected movements of NSCN rebels in troubled Tirap and Changlang districts have cast a shadow on some pockets in the twin districts, bordering Nagaland and Assam.         
	This election also has an unprecedented 63 crorepati MLAs in the fray.         
	If and when the time comes for backroom dealings to prop up a government, these rich men will play a big role.

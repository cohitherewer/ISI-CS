                                                                                                           Poor show hits NREGS funds
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 5: There are now fears that the much-hyped National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) may be discontinued in the state, as the Centre has stopped the release of funds.        
	Since the demand for wage employment between December and June is the highest, halting the scheme will hit those in the economically weak sections, hard. If central funding is stopped, the state will be forced to discontinue the scheme from February, said panchayati raj secretary R.N. Dash.        
	Dash had recently written to the Union rural development ministry seeking funds to the tune of Rs 646 crore.         
	Official sources said that the rural development ministry had stopped NREGS funds to the state citing poor (less than 60 per cent) expenditure and delay in submission of utilisation certificates.         
	The issue is going to assume political significance with the Assembly elections round the corner.        
	Earlier, chief minister Naveen Patnaik had taken up the matter with the Centre in a meeting with the Union rural development minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh.         
	While Naveen and the ruling BJD-BJP combine have been accusing the UPA government at the Centre of step-motherly treatment towards the NDA-ruled Orissa, the Centre and the Opposition parties, including the Congress, have been blaming the government for the poor performance.        
	It was revealed that at a high-level review, as many as 12 out of the total 30 districts had failed to spend 60 per cent of their allocated funds. Among the districts, coastal areas had performed miserably. Kendrapada had spent only 5 per cent of its allocated funds.         
	On the other hand, the hilly Gajapati district showed the best performance with an expenditure of 146 per cent, followed by Deogarh and Mayurbhanj (91 and 80 per cent respectively). Tribal-dominated Sonepur, Kalahandi, Jharsuguda and Nabarangpur had spent above 70 per cent and Rayagada utilised 65 percent of its funds.         
	As a whole, Orissa has spent Rs 388.03 crore by January end, out of its Rs 622 crore NREGS fund available in the current financial year.

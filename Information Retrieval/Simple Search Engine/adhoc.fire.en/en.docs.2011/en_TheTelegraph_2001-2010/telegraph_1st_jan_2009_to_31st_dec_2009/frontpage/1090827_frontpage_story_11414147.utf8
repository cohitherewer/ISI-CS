The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Dead mans SIM leads to his murderers
                                                                                                           Dead mans SIM leads to his murderers
  - Meghalaya police track calls made from Amit Agarwals mobile to zero in on abductors          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Shillong, Aug. 26: The gang which abducted and killed the Assam businessmans son, Amit Agarwal, before walking away with a ransom of Rs 8 lakh, made the crucial mistake of using the youths SIM to contact his family, giving police their most potent clue.        
	A day after arresting and extracting confessions from the gang, the police revealed how the SIM helped them zero in on the criminals.         
	The Ri Bhoi superintendent of police, R. Dkhar, today said one of the abductors used the SIM card of the mobile phone used by Amit after he was killed, and spoke to the youths family and other members of the criminal gang.         
	After we hatched a plan to catch the culprits, we tried to call Amits mobile phone which was ringing and one who took the call was one of the criminals, Dkhar said.         
	From mobile tracking devices, the police understood that the caller moved from Byrnihat to Guwahati and then to Morigaon. The police then apprehended the man at Morigaon and got the details of the rest of the gang from him.         
	The mobile tracking device helped us arrest the culprits though it was a little late, Dkhar said.         
	The four arrested abductors told the police today that after abducting Amit around 10am on July 22 from Byrnihat, where he had gone to inspect a stone quarry set up at the Industrial estate, they killed him around 10.30am. They later dumped the body in a jungle.         
	The body was recovered last evening.         
	According to a senior police official, the petty criminal gang was non-professional in their approach compared to the organised militant groups. It is strange that first they killed the man in their captivity and then asked for ransom, the official added.         
	The police said the criminal gang hailed from slum areas of Morigaon.         
	A day after the abduction on June 23, the gang demanded Rs 10 lakh from Amits relatives. Amits father, Naresh, negotiated with the abductors and agreed to pay Rs 8 lakh. In a surprise move, without informing the police, Naresh handed over Rs 8 lakh to the abductors on July 25 unaware that his son had already been killed.         
	Based on the confessions of the arrested criminals, including gang leader Ranjan Biswas, the police said Biswas deposited Rs 70,000 in three instalments in his bank account. The police have frozen the account and are investigating where the rest of the money went.

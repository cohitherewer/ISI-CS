          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Darjeeling, Dec. 29: The Gorkha Janmukti Vidyarthi Morcha has decided to intensify its agitation on the three national highways by increasing the blockade time to six hours from tomorrow, a day after 400 protesters were arrested and anti-Gorkhaland forces served an ultimatum to the government to intervene.         
	The Bangla Bangla Bhasa Bachao Committee yesterday asked the government to remove the blockades within 48 hours, failing which they would themselves march to the protest sites on NH55, NH31 and NH31A and force the picketers to move out. Today, the committee informed the district administration about its plan. We have sent intimations to the district magistrate, subdivisional officer of Siliguri and police officials, said Thakurdas Mukherjee, the committees secretary.        
	Keshav Raj Pokhrel, general secretary of the Vidyarthi Morcha, which is spearheading the blockade, today said: We have every right to protest peacefully and democratically. If these forces (anti-Gorkhaland) are trying to disrupt our peaceful protest, it will be the duty of the state and the Centre to provide us with protection.         
	From tomorrow NH31, NH31A and NH55 will be blocked from 10am to 4pm, he added. The highways connect the northeastern states, Sikkim and Darjeeling, with the rest of the country.         
	Home secretary Ardhendu Sen said at Writers Buildings today that he had instructed his officials to use dialogue to persuade the protesters to lift their blockade.        
	Undoubtedly the demonstrations are causing problems for the people. Due to the road blockade, people, especially those from Sikkim, are facing problems. I have asked the district magistrate and district police superintendent to use dialogue to persuade the demonstrators to lift, said Sen. The students had started with a three-hour blockade on Sunday and have subsequently increased it by an hour every day.         
	Doing a U-turn today, the Jalpaiguri administration remained aloof to the blockade on the road to Bhutan.         
	About a thousand Morcha supporters including students blocked the road that connects NH31 to Bhutan at Dalsinghpara.         
	Yesterday, the Jalpaiguri police arrested about 400 students and Morcha youths, including the Kalchini MLA Wilson Champromari.        
	Additional police superintendent of Alipurduar Anoop Jaiswal said: We have not taken any action today. He, however, did not react when asked why the sudden change in tactics. Champromari said todays blockade was peaceful. The police were there but they did not disturb us in any way, he said.

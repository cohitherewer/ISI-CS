The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Speaker seeks legal advice 
                                                                                                           Speaker seeks legal advice 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Shillong, March 16: There was high drama in the Meghalaya Assembly on the eve of the trial of strength, with Speaker Bindo Lanong seeking legal advice on Raj Bhavans unprecedented directive on recording the proceedings on video and a UDP legislator raising a ruckus over the governors message.         
	Since the message is something unprecedented in the House, it has to be carefully considered. Today, I have sent the letter of the governor to the Advocate-General, G.S. Massar, seeking legal opinion on the issues arising out of the letter of the governor, Lanong told the House after reading out Governor R.S. Mooshaharys directive on how he should conduct the trust vote.        
	The governor has directed the Speaker to videotape the proceedings of the floor test and submit it to him and to use ballot papers for voting in the event of failing to arrive at any decision by voice vote and submit the same to him after the vote of confidence.        
	The governor wants the Speaker to maintain status quo on the membership, speaking and voting rights of the members till the confidence motion is disposed of.         
	Lanong said he had requested the Advocate-General to give his opinion soon.         
	The House witnessed another unprecedented scene when UDP legislator Ardent Basaiawmoit stood up and shouted that he would break the microphone and sit on the table.         
	He said he could do whatever he liked with the governor restraining the Speakers powers. Basaiawmoit, was, in fact, trying to defend Lanong.         
	The Speaker also admitted a resolution moved by Congress member Ronnie Lyngdoh to remove him from the post alleging that Lanong had acted in a partisan manner while intending to disqualify the Independents who had deserted the MPA. The Speaker said the matter would be taken up on March 27.         
	The five legislators including two Independents, Ismail Marak and Limison Sangma, HSPDP member Adviser Pariong, KHNAM member Paul Lyngdoh and Deputy Speaker Sanbor Shullai who had been served with showcause notices were absent.         
	Notices were issued to them for deserting the MPA by violating the unity and the spirit of coalition government. If the Speaker suspends the voting rights of these legislators, 55 MLAs will be able to vote in the House.         
	The Opposition Meghalaya United Alliance (MUA) will have only 27 members (26 Congress and an Independent). The MPA will be reduced to 27 minus the Speaker since it has lost five members.         
	The calculation of MPA is that in the case of a tie of 27 each in both the MUA and the MPA, the Speaker who is with the ruling side may give his vote in favour of the MPA, salvaging the government during the trust vote.         
	The Congress today termed the Speakers decision to refer the governors message to the Advocate-General as a constitutional infraction. Leader of the Opposition D.D. Lapang told reporters that the Speaker had committed the highest constitutional infraction by referring the governors message, which is an exercise of unique constitutional prerogative, to the legal opinion of the Advocate-General.         
	Lapang met the governor and briefed him about the way his message under Article 175(2) of the Constitution was dealt with by the Speaker in the House. He also communicated to the governor that under Article 165(2) of the Constitution only the governor assigns work to the Advocate General and any other authority can assign the work with the prior sanction of the governor.         
	The Advocate General is appointed and removed by the doctrine of pleasure by the governor under Articles 165(1) and 165(3) of the Constitution. Therefore, he is a subordinate and inferior to the governor who is not competent or empowered to scrutinize the Governors powers under Article 175(2), he added.         
	According to Lapang, the Advocate General is empowered to tender opinion to the House if he is summoned to the House by a motion of the House, only on bills, resolutions, and other matters before the House and not on Governors messages to the House which is a unique constitutional prerogative.         
	Lapang appealed to the Governor to take appropriate steps to correct the constitutional infraction so that dignity and solemnity were restored to the office of the governor.        
	Lapang indicated that if the Opposition-led MUA loses the vote of confidence, his group would be ready to go even beyond the House to get justice.         
	Chief minister Donkupar Roy has warned that in case the Presidents rule is imposed in the state, the Congress will be held responsible.

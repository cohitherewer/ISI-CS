  - Tournament to start eight days late on April 18          OUR BUREAU                            Cricket South Africa chief Gerald Majola and Lalit Modi at the news conference in Johannesburg. (AP) See Sport                                        
	March 24: South Africa will host this years Indian Premier League (IPL) eight days later than scheduled.        
	IPL commissioner Lalit Modi, who flew in to Johannesburg this morning, made the announcement around 5pm local time (8.30pm IST) after wrapping up discussions with Cricket South Africa (CSA) chief executive Gerald Majola earlier in the day.         
	The tournament, originally slated to start from April 10 and end on May 24, has been curtailed by a week. It will now get under way from April 18 to accommodate the South African domestic season, which ends a day earlier with the final one-dayer between the home side and Australia at Johannesburg.         
	The precise schedule would be announced within a day or two, Modi said.        
	The IPL commissioner said the 59 games would be played across six venues over 36 days. The matches are expected to be held at Johannesburg, Durban, East London, Centurion, Port Elizabeth and Cape Town, which will be the likely venue for the opening ceremony.         
	The venues would be allotted keeping in mind weather conditions. For instance, cities which become extremely cold in May would be allotted games in April.        
	A statement released by N. Srinivasan, honorary secretary, Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), said each of the eight teams would continue to play on a home and away basis with seven matches at home.         
	The top four franchises in the league will contest the semi-finals and the victorious semi-finalists will meet in the grand final all over one weekend, the statement said.        
	The lucrative and high-on-glamour IPL had been looking for a stand-in host after the Indian cricket board shifted it out of the country following a security stand-off with the government arising out of the parliamentary elections.         
	England had been the initial favourites to host the league, but South Africa nosed ahead with CSA providing several ready-made answers to problems such as staging agreements, security and even the weather.         
	The South African government is believed to have spent yesterday heavily lobbying Modi and the IPL. There have been suggestions that South Africa would speed through visas for the players and had offered discounts on hotels and staging costs. The domestic provinces in that country have been told they can expect to earn a total of about 50 million rand (Rs 25.6 crore) from the tournament.         
	A BCCI source said CSA had been asked to arrange for 1,000 visas within the next 10 days. We are told the South African government has responded positively. With the soccer World Cup scheduled next year, South Africa is keen to send the signal that it is an ideal sporting destination, said the source.

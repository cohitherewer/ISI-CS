The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Burden off, Sourav lifts weights   Okay, I am used to this 
                                                                                                           Burden off, Sourav lifts weights
   Okay, I am used to this 
          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                             Chennai Super Kings skipper MS Dhoni watches a dog run across the ground as the IPL kicked off in Cape Town on Saturday. The dog dodged ground staff for over 10 minutes as the audience cheered, and retired into the stands only after being bribed with food. Underdogs too had their day, last years no-hopers Bangalore Royal Challengers bundling champions Rajasthan Royals for 58 to win by 75 runs, and Mumbai Indians humbling 2008 runner-up Chennai by 19. Veterans shone, with Anil Kumble taking 5-5, Rahul Dravid blasting 66 and Sachin coaxing 59. (AFP picture)                                       
	Cape Town, April 18: In John Buchanans eyes, Brendon McCullum scores heavily (among other things) on enthusiasm. Well, Sourav showed some of that this morning: despite it being a day off for the Kolkata Knight Riders, he did weights at the gym.        
	A strong indicator, clearly, that the franchises former captain intends making a point in the Indian Premier Leagues second edition, which began with an upset  Mumbai Indians surprising last years runners-up Chennai Super Kings  at lovely Newlands this afternoon.        
	Asked how he felt on the morning after the management announced that McCullum had replaced him at the helm, Sourav replied somewhat wryly: Okay... Im used to this, adding he would do a bit of sight-seeing.        
	Four years ago, Sourav had been similarly placed, at the receiving end of Greg Chappells lets-look-ahead policy. He did make a stunning comeback, in South Africa as it turned out, but the wait had been pretty long.        
	This time, for now at least, Sourav doesnt have to worry about having to make a return to the XI, but his presence there throughout the tournament isnt guaranteed. In the opener (against Deccan Chargers, tomorrow), though, hes likely to bat at No. 3.         
	While Sourav has much less pressure now, theres plenty on successor McCullum, the New Zealand vice-captain.        
	Oh, Im under no illusions at all.... I realise the captaincy has come with high pressure.... However, Im prepared for the challenges and so is the team.... Were a hungry lot, McCullum said, speaking exclusively at The Cullinan hotel.         
	Principal owner Shah Rukh Khan has gone on record saying that the change in captaincy had been a cricketing decision taken by people who have a cricketing head and mind.                    
	Shah Rukh also made the point that Dada had been part of that exercise, but theres no way Indias most successful Test captain wouldve endorsed his own sacking.        
	If anything, at different times, Sourav is understood to have asked the management why he was being singled out for the franchises third-from-bottom finish in 2008.        
	Buchanan (the cricket manager) has, of course, denied that Sourav was made a scapegoat.        
	Sourav may not talk about it, but he wouldve realised that in an owner-driven (and commercial) environment, the Shah Rukhs will have the biggest say and would listen to the one given complete powers to run the cricket component of the operations. In this case, Buchanan.        
	Going forward, its significant that the captains of the three franchises which finished at the bottom of the table, in the inaugural edition, have been changed.        
	The Reddys of Deccan Chargers and Vijay Mallya of the Bangalore Royal Challengers beat Shah Rukh, though.        
	Given the level of accountability (some, however, are wondering why only the captain has to pay the price), Rahul Dravids successor at the Royal Challengers, Kevin Pietersen, and coach Ray Jennings spent a couple of hours in the media centres back row watching the tournament opener, which preceded their match, and making notes.        
	The stakes are just too high.        
	Footnote: Former India captain Ravi Shastri feels no harm has been done by promoting McCullum. I dont know the background, but this gives Sourav the chance to play freely.... McCullums young and exciting, a today player, and no harm has been done, he maintained.

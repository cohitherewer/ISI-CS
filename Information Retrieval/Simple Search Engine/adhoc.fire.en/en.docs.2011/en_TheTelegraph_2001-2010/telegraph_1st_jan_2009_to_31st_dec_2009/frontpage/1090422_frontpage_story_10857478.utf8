  - Cong candidate faces tough battle        OUR CORRESPONDENT                                     
	Imphal, April 21: The second phase of polling in Manipurs Inner constituency tomorrow will be crucial for chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh as it is being seen as a referendum on the popularity of his ministry.         
	The seat becomes all the more important for Ibobi Singh given that the fate of the Congress candidate in Manipur Outer, Thangso Baite, hangs in the balance.         
	The Outer seat went to the polls on April 16 and no Congress leader could say with full confidence that Baite would emerge victorious.         
	Sitting Independent MP Mani Charenamai is expected to fare well this time as well.        
	If the Congress fails to win even one of the two seats in the state, Ibobi Singh will have a lot of explaining to do to the party high command. So tomorrows polling is crucial for us, a senior Congress leader admitted.         
	However, the Congresss Inner seat candidate and sitting MP, Thokchom Meinya Singh, was not Ibobi Singhs choice. The chief minister and his team had backed Congress MLA Irengbam Hemochandra Singh, but his candidature was rejected by the AICC.         
	Meinya Singh is engaged in a multi-cornered contest in Inner seat. He is facing a stiff challenge from Moirangthem Nara Singh of the CPI, a partner in the Congress-led Secular Progressive Front government in the state. The Manipur Peoples Party and the BJP candidates are also expected to put up a strong fight.        
	There are seven candidates in the fray, of which Meinya Singh, Nara Singh, Thounaojam Chaoba Singh of the MPP and Wahengbam Nipamacha Singh of the BJP are the frontrunners.         
	The other candidates are Loitongbam Kshetrani Devi of Rastriya Bahujan Congress Party and two Independents, A. Rahman and Nongmaithem Homendro Singh.         
	The MPP, a force to reckon with in the Inner, has been campaigning hard to ensure the Congresss defeat.        
	Okram Joy Singh, a senior MPP leader, said: It (the Inner polling) will be a referendum on Ibobi Singh government.         
	The Inner seat has a record of electing the candidate put up by the government of the day in Imphal. The Opposition claims this is because of money and muscle power.         
	Perhaps the CPI, a partner in the Ibobi Singhs coalition government, knows this well, too. It does not believe that security measures can prevent the use of unfair means during voting. So it has constituted mobile teams of its own to curb the use of unfair means by supporters of rival party candidates.         
	Our teams will be closely monitoring the voting process in all the 970 polling booths, a campaigning committee member of the CPI said.         
	Tomorrow, voting will be held in 970 polling stations in the four valley districts of Imphal West, Imphal East, Bishnupur and Thoubal. Micro observers (video recorders) will be posted at vulnerable polling stations, chief electoral officer Shambu Singh said.        
	Sources said 38 companies of central forces would be deployed at the polling booths with two sections (16 to 20 personnel) guarding each booth. Two to three unarmed homeguards and village defence volunteers will also be deployed at each station.         
	Besides, armed police, Manipur Rifles and IRB personnel will escort poll personnel and polling materials.

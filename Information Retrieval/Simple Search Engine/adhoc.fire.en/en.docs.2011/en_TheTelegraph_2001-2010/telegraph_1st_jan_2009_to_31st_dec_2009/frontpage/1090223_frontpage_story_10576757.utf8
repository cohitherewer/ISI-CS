	London, Feb. 22 (Reuters): Jade Goody married her ex-convict lover today in a hurriedly arranged ceremony.        
	Her pain from cancer dulled by medication, the terminally ill reality television star wed Jack Tweed away from the public gaze at a country hotel northeast of London. Photo and film rights were sold for a reported 1 million.        
	It was a very beautiful, very moving service, her publicist Max Clifford said of the 45-minute ceremony in front of around 200 guests.        
	Married wearing a wedding dress donated by Harrods owner Mohamed al-Fayed, Goody was due to be serenaded later by girl group Sugababes.        
	The rights money earned from the wedding will be set aside for her two young boys from a previous relationship.

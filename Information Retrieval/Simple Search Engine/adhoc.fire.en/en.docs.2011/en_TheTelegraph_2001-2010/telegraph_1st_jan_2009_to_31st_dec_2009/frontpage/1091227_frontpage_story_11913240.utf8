	Dec. 26: A Howrah resident, travelling on the Amritsar Express to Lucknow, was shot dead early today in a packed coach when he tried to resist a gang of robbers.         
	Siuji Prasad Gupta, 52, was accompanying his 23-year-old son Chandan, who was to sit for a banking examination in Lucknow, and had boarded the train at Howrah station around 2pm yesterday.         
	The officer in charge of Jasidih government railway police (GRP), S.K. Sinha, said a dozen dacoits had boarded the S1 coach of the train at Jasidih in Jharkhand around 1.40am today and started robbing passengers.        
	When they tried to snatch Guptas belongings, he put up a fight but was shot dead. Another passenger, A. Ahmed from Bowbazar, was also shot at when he tried to intervene but was lucky to get away with an injury to his arm. Two others were thrashed.        
	The robbers then waited till the train slowed down while approaching Jhanja station, about 345km from Calcutta, and then hopped off.         
	The robbers fired at Gupta at point-blank range, killing him on the spot when he tried to resist, Sinha said.         
	Chandan first informed his uncle Ramesh about the death of his father. I woke up to get a shocking telephone call from Chandan a little after 2am today, saying a gang of robbers had shot his father dead when he tried to stop them, Ramesh said.        
	Guptas widow Chandravati, 45, is in a state of shock.         
	Ramesh said his octogenarian mother was informed of the tragedy late in the evening. Initially, we did not tell her. But we had to when she started enquiring about my elder brother.        
	Gupta, who used to run a wheat grinding business, lived with his mother, wife, son and younger brother in a flat on 30 Rameswar Malia Lane in Howrah town. His daughter Mamata was married off in Rajasthan a few years ago.         
	Family members said Guptas son-in-law had left for Jasidih along with Ramesh and others in a car. His daughter is expected in Calcutta tomorrow.

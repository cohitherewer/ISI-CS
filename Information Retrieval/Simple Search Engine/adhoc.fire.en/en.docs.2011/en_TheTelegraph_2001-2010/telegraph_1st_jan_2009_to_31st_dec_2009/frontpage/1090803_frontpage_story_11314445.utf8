The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Airline strike off 
                                                                                                           Airline strike off 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 2: Private airlines have suspended a call to halt flights on August 18 after low-cost carrier leader SpiceJet broke ranks and said it was not interested in either a bailout or a confrontation with the government.        
	The Federation of Indian Airlines said it was suspending the protest in view of the agitating public and the governments willingness to enter into a dialogue, bowing to the power of low-cost carriers without whose support no strike could have succeeded.        
	SpiceJet told the FIA, an association of four big and six small airlines, this morning that it wanted to follow IndiGo Airlines and had no desire to participate in a strike. Ajay Singh, director of SpiceJet told The Telegraph: They (FIA) asked us to wait but by the evening, we decided to come out in the open. From the beginning we were very clear we are against any bailout for any airline  private or PSU  we simply want a level playing field in terms of jet fuel prices with other global airlines.         
	We have made that point and that is good enough; whats the need to suspend operations? Singh asked.        
	SpiceJet, which made a profit of Rs 26 crore in the first quarter of this year, usually sets the agenda for the countrys low-cost airlines which account for about 55 per cent of the aviation business.        
	MDLR, another small airline that is not part of the FIA, had also distanced itself from the strike.        
	Sources said the low-cost airlines felt that the agenda to draw the governments attention was being hijacked by the two bigger airlines  Jet and Kingfisher  and turned into an ego clash.        
	However, the FIA said in a statement that its secretary-general Anil Baijal has been able to impress upon the private airlines, including IndiGo, to put on hold their decision to suspend flights on August 18.        
	Cracks had emerged in the association yesterday after the government threatened action. Even before that, the airlines had betrayed their misgivings by continuing to sell tickets for August 18.

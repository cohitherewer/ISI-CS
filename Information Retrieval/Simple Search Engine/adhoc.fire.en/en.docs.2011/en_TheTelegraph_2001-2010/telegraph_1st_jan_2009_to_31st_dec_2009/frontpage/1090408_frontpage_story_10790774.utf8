          MOTOKO RICH                            Crichton                                  
	New York, April 7: Michael Crichton, the best-selling author of technological thrillers like The Andromeda Strain and Jurassic Park who died of cancer in November, left behind at least one finished novel and about one-third of a second.         
	Both will be released over the next year and a half, his publisher said. HarperCollins, Crichtons publisher for his previous three books, will release Pirate Latitudes, an adventure story set in Jamaica in the 17th century, on November 24. The company also plans to publish a technological thriller in the autumn of 2010, a novel that Crichton was working on when he died.         
	Jonathan Burnham, publisher of Harper, an imprint of HarperCollins, said Crichton evidently wrote Pirate Latitudes at the same time that he wrote Next, his last published novel.        
	The new novel, discovered by Crichtons assistant in the writers computer files after his death, features a pirate named Hunter and the governor of Jamaica, and their plan to raid a Spanish treasure galleon.         
	Its eminently and deeply and thoroughly researched, Burnham said. Its packed through with great detail about navigation and how pirates operated, and links between the New World and the Caribbean and Spain.        
	The novel represents a departure from Crichtons longtime fictional preoccupation with the moral and social ramifications of science and technology. But Burnham pointed out that Pirate Latitudes also harks back to the kind of historical yarn that Crichton wrote in the The Great Train Robbery, first published in 1975.         
	Burnham said that the book needed little editing and that Harper planned a first printing of 1 million copies.

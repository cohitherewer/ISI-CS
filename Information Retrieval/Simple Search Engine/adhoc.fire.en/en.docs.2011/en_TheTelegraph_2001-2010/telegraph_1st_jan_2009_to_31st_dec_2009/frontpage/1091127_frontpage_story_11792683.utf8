          SATISH NANDGAONKAR                      Kasab                                
	Mumbai, Nov. 26: A year after he gunned down innocents in Mumbai, Mohammed Ajmal Kasab no longer smiles in the courtroom.        
	Dubbed Smiling Assassin because of his earlier behaviour, when judge M.L. Tahaliyani had to reprimand him several times, the baby-faced Kasab now sits grim-faced or goes to sleep in the witness box.        
	Dressed in white kurta-pyjamas, the 22-year-old sat slouched on the wooden bench in the dock with his head bent and eyes closed on the anniversary of the carnage. He seemed uninterested in the proceedings even as a spat broke out between prosecution and defence, creating the possibility that Kasab could lose Abbas Kazmi, one of his two lawyers.        
	He did not raise his face or make eye contact with anyone, not even co-accused Faheem Ansari and Sabahuddin Ahmed with whom he would earlier joke and chat during court proceedings.        
	As the court broke for lunch, Kasab told the judge he wished to speak to him. The judge then called him for a 10-minute in-camera hearing. Court sources said Kasab told the judge he was happy that his food quality had improved after the courts intervention.         
	Judge Tahaliyani today pulled up defence lawyer Kazmi for lying to the court and threatened to remove him as Kasabs court-appointed lawyer. He adjourned the hearing till tomorrow morning to take a decision on whether Kazmi should be allowed to continue.        
	As a result, the prosecution failed to complete presenting the evidence on the first anniversary of 26/11 as promised.        
	The courtroom drama took place after lunch when Kazmi challenged the prosecutions demand to admit as evidence 340 affidavits sworn by formal witnesses. The prosecution was hoping to wrap up the examination of all 273 witnesses and then adduce the 340 affidavits, concluding its case by this evening.        
	Kazmi indicated he would not admit the affidavits as evidence without going through them, annoying Tahaliyani. Kazmi denied he knew that special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam had told the court formally he would adduce the affidavits on November 26.         
	Terming Kazmis behaviour irresponsible, the judge said the defence lawyer was lying because Nikam had several times indicated his plans about adducing the affidavits.        
	I am sure Kazmi was present when Nikam made these statements. The only purpose of giving (Kazmi) the affidavits in advance was to give him the opportunity to study the affidavits, Tahaliyani observed.        
	As it was crystal clear that Kazmi had lied before the court, the judge said there was no need to order a formal inquiry and adjourned the hearing. He indicated that if Kazmi were removed, his associate K.P. Pawar could represent Kasab.        
	Nikam said that if Kazmi submitted an unconditional apology, he should be allowed to continue. Does my body language indicate that I would apologise? Kazmi later told reporters.        
	Kazmi said that on November 17, the prosecution had given him 232 affidavits from formal witnesses but the letter accompanying them did not mention a clear date when the matter would be taken up. Nor did the prosecution make a formal application stating when it would take up the matter, he added. After Kazmis objections, Nikam moved the application.        
	The application said the prosecution intended to adduce affidavits as it would accelerate the speed of the trial and that it would in no way prejudice the defence as their evidence was of a formal nature.        
	The 340 witnesses are divided into 11 categories, including people who claimed the bodies of the 166 deceased, took the injured to hospitals, performed the autopsies and sent seized articles for forensic examination.

          OUR BUREAU                                              
	July 14: Maoists last night executed two farmers for seemingly inexplicable reasons in an area close to three security camps in Lalgarh, the choice of the targets suggesting an ominous change in strategy usually identified with besieged insurgencies thirsting to prove a point.        
	The site of the twin murders  Madhupur  is only 5km from the Khadibandh police camp set up after the recent Lalgarh operation; the Ramgarh police camp is 6km away and Lalgarh town, which has a larger camp, is 15km away.        
	Virtually under the nose of the police, Maoists have struck twice in four days, both times in villages close to Lalgarh, and killed four persons.         
	At Madhupur last night, the Maoists led two farmers  42-year-old Swapan Debsingha and 65-year-old Tarini Debsingha  out of their homes and shot them dead a short distance away. Last Friday, the Maoists had held a kangaroo court in Shirshi village, 10 km from the Dharampur police camp, pronounced two traders guilty of exploiting poor villagers and killed them.        
	What has surprised the security establishment is the tenuous link of at least three of the victims with the CPM  a steady relationship with the party is the usual criterion for the Maoists while picking out their targets.        
	According to Swapans wife Anima, her husband was once a supporter of the CPM but had turned a Trinamul loyalist two years ago. Recently, he had started supporting the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities  a group the government says is sympathetic to the Maoists.        
	Last night around 9.30, some people called my husband out, Anima said. He talked to them for a while and then he walked away with them.        
	Later that night, she heard gun shots but did not realise that her husband was being gunned down.        
	Tarinis son Dhiren said no one in the family knew when his father had been called out by the Maoists. He said his father used to be a CPM panchayat pradhan, but had kept no links with the party for 25 years. My father sleeps on his own outside the house so we didnt realise when he was led away, Dhiren said.        
	Maoist leader Bikash tonight claimed that the CPI (Maoist) was responsible for the killings.        
	The attacks had the hallmarks of shoot-and-scoot strikes familiar in areas where superior security forces outnumber and drive out rebels who sneak back taking advantage of the administrative and intelligence vacuum. Lalgarh now houses around 5,000 security personnel  both central and state  but little has been done so far to build back the apparatus of administration that broke down when the state government withdrew from the area eight months ago.        
	No one ventured out of the village last night. This morning, the bodies of Tarini and Swapan were found in a field. There was no reason for the killings, Dhiren said. The Maoists are desperate to prove their might now that they are on the retreat.        
	The police, too, found the killings baffling. West Midnapore superintendent of police Manoj Verma said: We find no reason why these people were killed. Its possible that the Maoists are desperate to prove their existence. The manner in which the killings took place is also a departure from their earlier strategy.        
	The police said that in the past, the Maoists had targeted either the police or prominent CPM leaders. An officer cited the names of some earlier victims: Rabi Kar and Mahendra Mahato, both of whom were prominent CPM leaders of Purulia.        
	In the latest killings, the victims were at best supporters of the party or those who had long dissociated themselves from the CPM, the officer added. The Maoists would never have hurt them earlier. It reflects the attitude of someone on the run.        
	Besides, a Maoist leader, Shekhar, had recently said: We always warn our enemies thrice before killing them. We give them the opportunity to reform. Its only when they dont that we kill them.        
	None of the four was given a single warning.

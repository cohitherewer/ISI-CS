The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Detroit plane scare cracks US shield
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Detroit plane scare cracks US shield
          K.P. NAYAR                       The flight from Amsterdam after arriving at Detroit Metropolitan Airport on Friday. (AP)                          
	Washington, Dec. 26: A Nigerian claiming links to al Qaida tried to set off an incendiary device on a plane that was landing in Detroit on Christmas Day in an attempted act of terrorism, according to a White House official.        
	The failed attempt by Abdul Farouk Abdulmutallab to detonate a device, described by officials as a mixture of powder and liquid, cast a shadow on the Obama administrations nearly year-long effort to restore a semblance of normality to the national security environment.        
	Passengers on the plane described a series of pops that sounded like firecrackers.         
	Nearly 24 hours after the Delta Airlines plane on a transatlantic flight from Amsterdam landed safely, authorities across the US were putting on a calm front and refusing to raise the terror alert level.         
	Early morning passengers at airports in the national capital area, however, reported additional security measures at approaches and screening areas today.        
	The US has five colour-coded levels of security, devised after September 11, 2001. Yesterday began with orange, when the security threat is at the second level and that is where it remained at the time of writing today.        
	President Barack Obama, who was celebrating Christmas in Hawaii, where he has a half sister and other relatives, talked to his counter-terrorism adviser and chief of staff at the National Security Council. He did not go into a flap as his predecessor, George W. Bush, used to do on such occasions.        
	The Detroit scare was reminiscent of an incident almost to the day eight years ago when British national Richard Reid tried to set off explosives hidden in his shoes on a transatlantic flight.        
	Unlike now, that incident almost disrupted air travel worldwide. Since then, passengers flying to and within the US have to remove shoes before security screening.        
	Obama did not interrupt his holiday plans but instructed aides to ensure that all steps were in place to provide secure air travel.        
	In an effort not to alarm the public, authorities here were being quoted on TV today as saying they could not even confirm whether Abdulmutallab, 23, was acting on the instructions of al Qaida or was merely inspired by its ideology.        
	It was unclear how the man managed to get the explosives on the plane, an Airbus A330 wide-body jet carrying 278 passengers that departed from Amsterdam with passengers who had originated in Nigeria. Dutch authorities said the man had taken the flight from Nigeria with a valid US visa.        
	A senior department of homeland security official said the materials Abdulmutallab had on him were more incendiary than explosive. Abdulmutallab told law enforcement authorities, the official said, that he had had explosive powder, acquired from Yemen, taped to his leg and that he had mixed it with chemicals held in a syringe.        
	Although Abdulmutallab is said to have told officials that he was directed by al Qaida, the official expressed caution about that claim, saying it may have been aspirational.         
	His name is on a terrorist watch list, but not on the so-called no-fly list, which may have prevented him from boarding the plane at all.        
	A senior Nigerian banker said he feared Abdulmutallab was his son. A Nigerian daily reported the father had informed US authorities of his sons radical views.        
	The incident unfolded just before noon. There was a pop that sounded like a firecracker, said Syed Jafry, a passenger. A few seconds later, he said, there was smoke and some glow from the suspects seat and on the left side of the plane. There was a panic, said Jafry, 57, of Ohio. Next thing you know, everybody was on him. He said the passengers and the crew subdued the man.        
	The Nigerian was severely burnt below his waist in the scuffle after which he was pinned and restrained to a first-class seat as the aircraft landed safely in Detroit.

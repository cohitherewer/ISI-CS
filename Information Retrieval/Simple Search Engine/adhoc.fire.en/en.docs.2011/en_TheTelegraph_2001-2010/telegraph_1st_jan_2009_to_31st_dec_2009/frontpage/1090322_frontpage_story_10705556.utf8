          NICK GREENE                            Michelle Obama digs up the White House lawn for a kitchen garden. (AP)                                  
	Washington, March 21: Michelle Obama has begun digging an organic kitchen garden at the White House which will supply the first family with vegetables for many of their meals.         
	With help from a group of Washington primary school students, the First Lady began work on the project that will provide the raw material for many of the Obama meals.         
	Early in her stint as First Lady, Michelle Obama has outlined healthy eating habits as one of her favoured causes. She has consulted Alice Waters, the celebrated Californian chef and restaurateur who also runs a project in which she teaches children to grow their own vegetables and eat healthily.        
	The White House garden is aimed to be a symbolic confrontation to childhood obesity, a fast-growing health concern in the US where many are increasingly exasperated by the overwhelming presence of fast food restaurants.Once they start dining on fennel, broccoli and spinach grown a few hundred feet from their kitchen, the Obamas will become locavores.         
	A locavore  a term coined by Waters  is part of a larger sustainability movement that believes eating locally grown food weans dependence from large industrial farms.

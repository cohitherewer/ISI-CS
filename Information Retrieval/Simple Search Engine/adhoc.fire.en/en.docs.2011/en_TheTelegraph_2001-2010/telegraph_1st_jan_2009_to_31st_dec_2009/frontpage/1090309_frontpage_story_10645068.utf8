                                                                                                           1984 hot plot from Orwells affair
          ROYA NIKKHAH                            Orwell                                  
	London, March 8: Rare letters written by George Orwell, including some to his secret lover, are to go on sale for the first time.         
	The letters by Orwell, the author of classics including Nineteen Eighty-Four and Animal Farm, are addressed to Dennis Collings and Eleanor Jaques, two of his closest friends during the early 1930s.         
	They reveal the love triangle between Orwell, Jaques and Collings, when the author began a secret relationship with Jaques, the girlfriend of Collings. Jaques and Collings later married.         
	The 20 letters by Orwell, written under his real name of Eric Arthur Blair, have been described as the most revealing documents in existence about the author.         
	They are being sold by the sole surviving daughter of Jaques and Collings, and are expected to fetch more than 40,000 when they are auctioned by Bonhams this month.         
	The letters, were written between 1931 and 1933 when Orwell was struggling to get his work published.         
	In one letter to Jaques, written in August 1932 shortly after they began their affair, Orwell, then 29 and working as a school master in Middlesex, pleads with her to keep to a date they have arranged.         
	He writes: Do not forget Tuesday, 2.15pm by Smiths bookshop. And as you love me, do not change your mind before then... Till then, with all my love, adding in a postscript: Please send me a line to reassure me that you have not changed your mind.         
	Another letter written the following month reveals the intimacy of their relationship. I cannot remember when I have enjoyed any expeditions so much as I did those with you, he writes.         
	Especially that day in the wood along Blythburgh Lodge  you remember, where the deep beds of moss were. I shall always remember that, amp; your nice white body in the dark green moss....        
	Orwell later used similar language in Nineteen Eighty-Four, when describing a love scene between Winston and Julia set in the woods, where Julias body gleamed white in the sun.         
	The letters to Jaques also reveal Orwells deep insecurities about their illicit relationship, and his desire not to offend Collings, his friend and love rival.         
	In a letter dated 19 October, 1932, he writes: I hope you will let me make love to you again some time, but if you dont it doesnt matter, I shall always be grateful to you for your kindness to me....         
	Another letter says: When we were together, you didnt say whether you were going to let me be your lover again. Of course you cant if Dennis is in Swold, but otherwise? You mustnt if you dont want to, but I hope you will.

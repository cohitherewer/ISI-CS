   Court punch follows pat   for Sanjay           OUR BUREAU                            Sanjay Dutt at a news conference in Delhi on Tuesday. Picture by Ramakant Kushwaha                                              
	March 31: As the Supreme Court began delivering the verdict, Sanjay Dutts supporters would have been smiling.        
	The court was referring to the actors contribution to art and cinema and generally crime-free record  just the sort of praise it had heaped on former cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu before staying his conviction and allowing him to fight the polls.        
	Minutes later, with a despite the favourable circumstances the court had dashed Sanjays hopes of contesting this general election.        
	Sidhu, the court explained, was an MP when he was convicted of causing a mans death in a brawl, and had shown high moral standards by resigning his Amritsar seat immediately though the law did not require him to do so.        
	Besides, the trial court (had) acquitted him (Sidhu) and the high court, in reversal, found him guilty.        
	There were no such mitigating circumstances in Sanjays favour, the bench said, adding that he had been convicted of a serious offence  illegal possession of arms in connection with the 1993 blasts case.        
	Sanjay, away in Lucknow where the Samajwadi Party had planned to field him, apparently learnt the news from TV at 2.30pm. For the whole day he had been holed up in party leader Amar Singhs house, neither stepping out to campaign nor talking to the media.        
	When he emerged to face the media two hours later, he looked devastated. I respect the judiciary and the law of the country, Sanjay said.        
	Would wife Maanyata contest in his place? The actor replied: Its up to the party to decide.         
	Samajwadi sources said Maanyata, deeply upset at the judgment, had refused to be a candidate.        
	Under the law, no one sentenced to more than two years in jail can contest elections till six years after his release. Sanjay, sentenced to six years, had pinned his hopes on the exception made for Sidhu.        
	He had switched off his everyday mobile phone today and was using one with a confidential number, nervously calling up his lawyers since morning, party sources said. Amar Singh regularly rang him from Delhi to assure him of a favourable verdict.        
	The petitioner (Sanjay) is a well-known cine artist and because of his contribution to art and cinema he has got (a) large number of fans throughout the country and abroad, Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan read out from the verdict.        
	His father was also a well-known film actor and he was deeply involved in politics. (he) was a minister in the Union cabinet. The petitioner is not a habitual criminal nor had been involved in any other criminal case.        
	Legal activists welcomed the judgment. This is a boost to democracy and rule of law. The floodgates to criminalisation of politics would have opened had the court ruled otherwise, an activist said.        
	Sanjay left for Delhi this evening, but told reporters: Im not going anywhere. I am here to stay in Lucknow. It has become my city and I will support any candidate decided by my party and will even campaign for him or her.

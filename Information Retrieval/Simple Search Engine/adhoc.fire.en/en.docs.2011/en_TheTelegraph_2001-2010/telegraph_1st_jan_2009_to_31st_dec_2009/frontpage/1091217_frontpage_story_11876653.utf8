          JAYANTA BASU                                               
	Copenhagen, Dec. 16: The uncertainty and deep frustration over the lack of progress in talks at the climate summit is now tempered with hope that world leaders may achieve what negotiators and ministers couldnt.        
	World leaders, including President Barack Obama, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, are expected to join the summit on Dec 17-18 to endorse a political statement for real action in the coming months.         
	The Copenhagen talks have thus far failed to resolve two of the most contentious issues: the amount of emission reductions by the industrialised countries, and the architecture of the future global agreement to combat climate change.         
	The developed countries need to come up with ambitious emission cuts targets. That is critical to the success of the conference. The numbers put on the table so far are disappointing, Indias foreign secretary Nirupama Rao said in New Delhi.         
	The summit was intended to finalise emission cuts by developed countries for the period beyond 2012 -- the second phase of the 12-year old Kyoto Protocol that imposes legally binding commitments on industrialised countries.        
	Instead, the summit has intensified a debate over whether the Kyoto Protocol should continue in its current form at all. Critics are arguing that the protocol leaves out the US and China which account for 50 per cent of world emissions.        
	The president of Copenhagen climate summit, Connie Hedegaard, Denmarks climate and energy minister, resigned this morning and will be replaced by Danish Premier Lars Lokke Rasmussen.        
	With so many heads of state and government (arriving), its appropriate that the Prime Minister of Denmark presides, quot; Hedegaard told the 192-nation meeting. However, the Prime Minister has appointed me as his special representative and I will thus continue to negotiate, she said.        
	Many feel that Hedegaard was unhappy with the contents of the so-called Danish text -- a secret negotiating text prepared by rich countries.        
	Uncertainty and confusion persists over the content and nature of the political statement with the Danish government set to come up with a fresh draft -- already dubbed the Copenhagen outcome -- later tonight.        
	India has said it does not want the Copenhagen outcome to turn into a template for a new mandate that detracts from existing accepted principles of the different types of actions from industrialised and developing countries.        
	We are told that the Danish will be coming up with a draft within few hours time but I can not comment on it without seeing the draft Indias environment minister Jairam Ramesh told The Telegraph on Wednesday.        
	Ramesh, however, said the draft will be single text but with two tracks, indicating that the text will recognise both the Kyoto Protocol and the long-term co-operative action -- the two negotiating tracks on climate change.        
	India and other developing countries are worried that a new agreement to replace the Kyoto Protocol might pave the way for effective emission reduction targets and international scrutiny of domestic actions for developing countries.        
	We cannot accept legally binding cuts. We cannot accept an agreement on peaking (of emissions) order. We cannot accept international monitoring of our voluntary efforts to cut emissions, Rao said, reiterating Indias non-negotiables.         
	But current and former negotiators are worried about a draft text of an accord circulated yesterday. The language indicates that the industrialised countries are trying to introduce a new agreement through the backdoor, they said.         
	The draft mentions emissions cuts for all, a thorough review of actions, and it contains no reference to the principle of shared but differentiated responsibilities enshrined in the Kyoto Protocol and the Bali Action Plan hammered out two years ago. This amounts to the entry of a new protocol through the backdoor, a former negotiator said.         
	We are not rejecting the document outright but are quiet wary about it. Many major postulates of the Bali Action Plan and the Kyoto Protocol have not found space in the revised document, said Chandrasekhar Dasgupta, a member of the Indian delegation. If the draft goes through in its present structure, it will amount to accepting a new protocol, another negotiator said.         
	However, there is a counter-view within the Indian contingent. We need to be circumspect and balanced. There is no point in paranoia over the draft. We can always oppose issues like shared but differentiated responsibility being excluded, but we also have to accept our responsibility in cleaning up the air. We can not evade responsibility, said another Indian key negotiator, signalling a willingness to imagine a post-Kyoto scenario.        
	Environment minister Ramesh apparently shares the view.        
	A statement from the European Union has further fuelled fears about intentions relating the Kyoto Protocol. We fought hard to rescue the Kyoto Protocol ... But the protocol will not be enough to win the battle against climate change.        
	We must strive for an agreement that is more ambitious with broader participation and legally-binding for all, the EU statement said, also referring to a comment by former Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi at a conference in Stockholm decades ago where she had stated that poverty was the biggest polluter.

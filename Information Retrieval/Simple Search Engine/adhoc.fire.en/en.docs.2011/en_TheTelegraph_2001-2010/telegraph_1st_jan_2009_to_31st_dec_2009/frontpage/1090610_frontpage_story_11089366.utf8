The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Love thy neighbour and turn off the AC as power plays hide and seek
                                                                                                           Love thy neighbour and turn off the AC as power plays hide and seek
          SUVRO ROY                             One of the lakhs of houses affected by the power cuts was that of Prabhjyot Chadha, the niece of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, in Behala. The house was without power between 11am and 1pm and again between 4.45pm and 6.30pm. (Amit Datta)                                  
	First law of life in Calcutta: If demand goes up, there will be power cuts.        
	Second law of life in Calcutta: If demand goes down, there will be power cuts.        
	Third and latest law of life in Calcutta: If it is summer, switch off the AC after 6pm and love thy neighbour.              
	Over 19 lakh homes in Calcutta reeled under rolling power cuts that struck at will from morning through evening on a day the city became a baking oven because of a break in the monsoon.        
	Those assigned to keep the city supplied with power pulled out tested and tired phrases from their lexicon: technical glitch, tripping, demand-supply mismatch and Budge Budge plant.                
	The usual suspect  a Budge Budge plant unit tripped on Tuesday  is expected to be back on its feet by Wednesday evening, which means the ordeal could continue till then.        
	We expect to bring the unit back by 8pm tomorrow. Our engineers are carrying out repairs on a war footing, said Dilip Sen, the executive director of CESC, the power supply company.        
	With households, offices and educational establishments suffering for long hours, the state government called an emergency meeting with CESC officials in the afternoon but no immediate solution could be found.        
	Correction. The home secretary did have one solution but its success depends on how caring Calcuttans are for their fellow citizens. Given the situation, we would urge all AC users not to use it after 6pm. Using AC by one household might affect 10 to 15 homes in terms of power consumption, home secretary Ardhendu Sen.        
	A noble appeal indeed. But when the minimum relative humidity rockets to an oppressive 65 per cent, against the usual 40 per cent at this time of the year, it remains to be seen how many Calcuttans will be lion-hearted enough to think of their neighbours.        
	The Telegraph looks at the cause of the power cuts and the constraints before mitigation and solution.         
	Budge Budge jinx        
	A 250MW unit of CESCs Budge Budge plant was shut down around 7.30am on Tuesday following a snag in a turbine rotor.         
	This is the second time in six days that a unit at the Budge Budge plant has collapsed. On June 3, the second 250MW unit at Budge Budge had packed up after a tube leak in its boiler.        
	Is poor maintenance to blame? We try to maintain our units well but a snag can always develop, a CESC official said.        
	Transmission woes        
	The shutdown meant that CESCs generation capacity went down by 250MW. Around the same time, demand also rose because of the rise in temperature, pushing the shortfall up to 270MW.        
	The shortfall kept creeping up through the day. CESC tried to bridge the gap by buying power from elsewhere  500MW from the West Bengal State Electricity Transmission Company Ltd (WBSETCL), 89MW from NTPC and 30MW from two other sources. Still the shortfall at the evening peak hour was 215MW.        
	Even if more power was available, the CESC could not have drawn it because its transmission network is unable to receive more than 600MW from outside grids.        
	 So, was there no other solution? Yes, there could have been one. CESC could have taken more power from the Kasba sub-station of the WBSETCL because, unlike the outside grids, this transmission line is integrated to the CESC systems.         
	But there is a catch. The state-run transmission company has to service areas other than Calcutta, such as Salt Lake, Rajarhat and Sonarpur, and one place cannot be supplied at the expense of others.        
	The solution         
	The only way out is capacity augmentation  both in terms of generation and transmission.        
	Technical snag can happen in a power plant. But as consumers, we have the right to ask why the capacity has not been augmented to tackle such situations, said Sujoy Basu, former director of the School of Energy Studies, Jadavpur University.         
	CESC has more questions to answer. We often hear that because of a sudden rise in demand, the units collapse. I want to know whether they have a proper load forecasting model in place? asked a professor of electrical engineering of Bengal Engineering and Science University in Shibpur.         
	Land hurdle                
	Bengals biggest problem  the squaring of craving for development with the trauma of parting with land  lies at the root of lack of augmentation.        
	The government had drawn up a plan to expand capacity by setting up two substations at Rajarhat in North 24-Parganas and Subhashgram in South 24-Parganas.         
	But the transmission network could not be completed as land owners refused to give away small tracts required to set them up. For the past one-and-a-half years, this problem is persisting, said A. Sarkar, director (transmission), WBSETCL.         
	When WBSETCL officials went to Rajarhat a few months ago  each tower would require around 150sqm  some residents attacked the officials and the plan was shelved. The agency has not been able to set up three towers near Rajarhat and around 12 towers near Subhashgram.         
	Setting up of these towers could have solved todays problem as the WBSETCL could have used the proposed substations to service the other areas while Kasba could have been set aside exclusively for Calcutta.

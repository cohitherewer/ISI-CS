The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Why your heroic holiday in Kashmir was worth it
                                                                                                           Why your heroic holiday in Kashmir was worth it
  - Tourists from Bengal flock to Valley, help fight adverse impact of Taliban infiltration fears          MUZAFFAR RAINA                      Calcutta tourist Dilip Maity on the banks of the Dal Lake in Srinagar                                
	Srinagar, Oct. 18: Bengalis back from Puja holidays can fight Monday morning blues with this gratifying revelation: an act of bravery by some among you has done its bit to keep Kashmiris smiling.        
	Travel-loving Bengalis have come to the rescue of the Valleys battered tourism-driven economy after months of turmoil kept visitors away for over a year. If it was the Amarnath land protests last year, reports about Taliban presence in Kashmir and street fury over the alleged rape and murder of two women earlier this year put tourists off for most of 2009.        
	But Bengalis, known for their wanderlust and a fascination for Kashmir that had once made the Valley their favourite honeymoon spot, have been flocking to the Valley. Around 5,000 tourists are coming to Kashmir daily and more than 85 per cent of them are from Bengal, G.M. Dug, chief of Kashmir Tourism Alliance, an association of tourism-related organisations, said last week. This has increased occupancy in our hotels to around 65 per cent.        
	During the first eight months of 2009, the only comfort for a large number of Kashmiris dependent on tourism as their sole bread and butter was the Amarnath Yatra in July-August, which brought no less than four lakh pilgrims. During these two months, occupancy rates in our hotels shot up to even 100 per cent. But the situation was bad for the rest of the year, Dug said.         
	Tourism minister Nawang Rigzin Jora blamed baseless reports about the presence of Taliban rebels in Kashmir for the tourism slowdown.        
	Our efforts to attract tourists had succeeded in a big way and people had made bookings five months in advance. But then came the untrue reports about Taliban presence and everything went down the drain, Jora said. Bookings were cancelled and we were back to square one.         
	Dilip Maity, a businessman from Park Circus in Calcutta, was aware of the reports. But they didnt stop him from going to Kashmir with his family.         
	We had planned to visit Kashmir during the Puja holidays. Yes, there were reports that the situation in Kashmir was not good, but our travel agents convinced us it was safe, Maity, a first-time visitor to Kashmir, said.         
	There was one incident of grenade-throwing in Lal Chowk that did scare us a little. But we didnt find any trouble other than that. We went to Pahalgam, rode a shikara on the Dal Lake and visited the Mughal Gardens. Its such a pleasure being here.        
	Pulak Bose of Transworld Travels in Calcutta said his agency had recorded around 60 per cent growth in travellers from the city to Kashmir this Puja, compared with the past few years figures.         
	Although the situation is much better in Kashmir now, we still tell people who do their bookings through us not to venture out in the dark and to keep their heads covered in Kashmir, in keeping with our Valley contacts advice, Bose said.        
	The revival -- coming three years after tourists from Bengal were killed in two militant attacks that prompted Jyoti Basu to ask why are they (the tourists) going to Kashmir at this juncture? ----- has something to do with word of mouth too.        
	My friends told me Kashmir was quite safe. During our 10-day trip around Gulmarg and Pahelgam, we did not feel unsafe, said Arnab Das from Delhi today just before boarding a Calcutta-bound flight on his way back from Kashmir. Das had gone with a group of 17 people, including his three-year-old son Aranya.        
	Tourism minister Jora said the protests over the alleged rape and murder in Shopian, which led to violent street clashes, also scared away tourists.        
	At one point, the minister said, the state governments hopes of hosting 1.5 million tourists and pilgrims this year had looked wildly off the mark. But the government, he added, is now looking at a figure of over a million, buoyed largely by tourists from Bengal.

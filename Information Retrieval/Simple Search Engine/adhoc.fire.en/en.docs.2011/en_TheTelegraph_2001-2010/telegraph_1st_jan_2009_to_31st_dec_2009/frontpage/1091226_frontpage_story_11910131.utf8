	Ranchi/New Delhi, Dec. 25: Dumped by the Congress in no uncertain terms, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) acted on its next best option today, declaring it was ready to form a government with the BJP with Shibu Soren as chief minister.        
	The BJP and Ajsu have agreed to support the JMM, the partys vice-president, Hemlal Murmu, told newsmen in Ranchi after newly elected party legislators authorised Soren to take a final call on government formation.        
	The BJPs Jharkhand in charge, Karuna Shukla, confirmed the move, admitting Soren had talked to her seeking the partys support. I have told the state unit president, Raghubar Das, to discuss the issue with the JMM, she told The Telegraph.        
	Along with the Sudesh Mahtos Ajsu, which is ready to join the government with five MLAs, and the JD(U)s two MLAs, a JMM-BJP government would have the safety net of numbers (see chart), but not foolproof stability given that the two primary partners were known to have their differences over some key issues.        
	For one, the JMMs aggressive pro-tribal policies may not go down well with the largely non-tribal support base of the BJPs. Also, there was the question of the JMMs sympathetic views on Maoists.         
	Nevertheless, the BJP felt this was their opportunity and the partys general secretary Ananth Kumar and former party president Rajnath Singh were scheduled to arrive in the state capital late tonight to set in motion the process of forming a government.        
	After a meeting of its legislature party tomorrow, Rajnath, Shukla and Ananth Kumar were expected to meet Soren. They would together call on Governor K. Sankaranarayanan later to stake claim to form a government.        
	The process of a power-sharing arrangement between the BJP and JMM was speeded up this morning once the BJP had irrefutable information that Soren was against doing a deal with the Congress.        
	BJP chief Nitin Gadkari, his predecessor Rajnath and general secretary (organisation) Ramlal sat together and decided they must not pass up the opportunity to first, forge an anti-Congress front in Jharkhand and second, claim power in a state even if it meant playing second fiddle to the JMM.        
	We cant afford to sit tight and let the Congress walk all over us, a party official said.        
	It was also felt that acquiring a government in Jharkhand would kick-start Gadkaris innings on the right note. At least our cadres would feel enthused and get a sense that the new president means business, the official said.        
	Jharkhand was Gadkaris first political test. It seems he wanted to come out in flying colours.        
	Rajnath, who was tasked by Gadkari to speak to the JMM and other prospective allies, got in touch with Soren and conveyed that the BJP would make him the chief minister. That done, it was made clear that the BJP would be part of the new dispensation and take half the ministerships. Soren agreed.        
	Although the BJP would like to have its deputy chief minister, it was unclear if Soren would agree to it. If he doesnt so be it. We will not make it a prestige issue, a Rajnath aide said.        
	Gadkari wanted to nominate Rajnath as an observer but in keeping with his position as a former president, he let it be known that he would travel as a political manager.         
	Murmus announcement came even as senior BJP leaders including, Shukla, Yashwant Sinha, Karia Munda, Arjun Munda and Das went into a huddle in Ranchi to deliberate on aligning with the JMM.                                
	According to sources, two views emerged at the meeting. One, the party should extend support from outside which could leave options open, while the other view was to join the government with the posts of deputy chief minister and Speaker.        
	Ultimately, the second view prevailed.        
	Ever since results threw up a hung House with the JMM in the drivers seat with 18 MLAs, Soren has been maintaining that he would settle for nothing less than the post of the chief minister.        
	We are the single largest party. We should get a chance to form the government. Others can come and support us if they want to, Soren said.

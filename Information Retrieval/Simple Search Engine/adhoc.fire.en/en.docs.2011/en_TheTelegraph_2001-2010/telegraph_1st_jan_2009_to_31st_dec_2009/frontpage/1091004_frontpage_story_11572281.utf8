	Ranchi, Oct. 3: Some of the top athletes of the country come free. But if you are interested in seeing Katrina Kaif and Akshay Kumar strut their stuff, then shell out Rs 500.        
	The National Games Organising Committee (NGOC) today announced free entry for everybody to all events of the Games except for the opening and closing ceremonies set to feature the two Bollywood stars, among others.        
	The two ceremonies, scheduled for November 1 and December 5, will showcase a Bollywood package of song and dance featuring Katrina and Akshay for half an hour on both days and tickets for the live events have been priced at Rs 200 and Rs 500.        
	We have decided that there will be no daily tickets for seeing the Games. However, tickets of Rs 200 and Rs 500 denomination will be available for the opening and closing ceremonies, said the NGOC spokesman-cum-treasurer, M.K. Pathak.        
	Pathak also clarified that both Akshay and Katrina would be paid from the targeted revenue of Rs 21 crore, which is to be generated by marketing the Games.         
	Mohali-based Creatiwitty has signed an agreement with NGOC and has promised to deliver the amount to the organisers.        
	October 12 will see the formal handing over of the Games flag by the governor to the NGOC secretary general. That day, Daler Mehndi is scheduled to perform at the indoor gymnastic stadium. Entry to his concert will be by invitation only.        
	However, Dalers programme is already seeing a hitch as officials who visited the indoor stadium today realised that acoustics there may not be suitable for a live musical performance.         
	There is a lot of echo, said Pathak.        
	The organising committee hopes to net a handsome amount from the opening and closing ceremonies.

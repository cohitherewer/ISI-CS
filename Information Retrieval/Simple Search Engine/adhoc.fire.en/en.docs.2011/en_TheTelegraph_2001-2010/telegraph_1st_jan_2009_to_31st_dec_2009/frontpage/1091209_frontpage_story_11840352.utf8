  - Move to keep peace talks on track         A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	Guwahati, Dec. 8: Families of captive Ulfa leaders Arabinda Rajkhowa, Raju Barua, Sasha Choudhury and Chitrabon Hazarika have been brought under police surveillance for their security.         
	Highly placed sources in the state police today said the move was initiated on instructions from Delhi, which is wary of any misfortune befalling the family members as that could queer the talks pitch the government is trying to put in place.         
	The sources said security personnel in uniform had already been assigned the task and were shadowing the family members.         
	We have not put any restrictions on their (family members) movements but have informed them that they were being tailed and also advised them that there was no real need for them to speak about it, a source said.         
	There could be vested interests who would not like to see the talks take off and targeting the family members would suit their plans perfectly, he said.         
	There are many who may be harbouring a grudge against the Ulfa leadership for some incidents in the past, the source added.         
	The police are also wary of the fact that family members of Ulfa leaders and cadres have been targets earlier too, especially during the secret killings phase.         
	While Arabinda Rajkhowas elder brother was murdered in Dibrugarh by secret killers, Raju Baruas brother-in-law was killed in Nalbari.         
	Any attack on the family members at this juncture could put paid to efforts made so far to try and bring the outfit forward for talks, the source said, adding that in such a case, the military wing of Ulfa could get provoked to carry out retaliatory strikes.         
	That would then restart the entire cycle of killings and push back the talks issue, he said.        
	In a related development, the Peoples Committee for Peace Initiatives in Assam (PCPIA) today staged a sit-in here demanding the release of Ulfa leaders and talks with them at the earliest.         
	The PCPIA also decried the manner in which Rajkhowa and Barua were brought to the court in handcuffs.         
	However, a senior police official said that the authorities had not violated any law by bringing the leaders to the court in handcuffs.         
	That is the way we handle arrested cadres who execute orders and these are the leaders who issue the orders, he explained.

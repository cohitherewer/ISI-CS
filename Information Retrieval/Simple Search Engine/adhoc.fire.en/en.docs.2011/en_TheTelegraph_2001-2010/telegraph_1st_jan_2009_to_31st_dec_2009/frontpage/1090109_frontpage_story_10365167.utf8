	New Delhi, Jan. 8: Striking oil executives have raised the spectre of a fuel crisis in the country, igniting panic purchase and prompting petroleum minister Murli Deora to head late tonight to talks at a venue outside Delhi.        
	But PTI reported around 1.30am that the talks ended in a deadlock. Deora is expected to raise the issue with the Prime Minister tomorrow.        
	The public sector officials have gone on strike demanding higher pay, although Delhi High Court had declared the action illegal.        
	Long lines of cars were seen in several places, including Calcutta. (See Metro)         
	Police raided a Noida IOC complex where union leaders were hiding but the strike spearheads escaped. The leaders went underground after some colleagues were arrested under the Essential Services Maintenance Act which some states, not Bengal, have invoked.        
	The impact of the strike is expected to deepen with a federation of petroleum traders offering support to the officials and seeking higher commission.        
	The government is expected to tap private refineries. The Territorial Army has been deployed in some places to refuel planes.

                                                                                                           City swoop
                            
	Oct. 6: Police sealed a printing press in Manicktala and arrested its owner as part of a widening crackdown on suspected Maoist sympathisers in Calcutta.        
	The government appeared to be concentrating on fringe groups, steering clear of potential flashpoints by making it clear during the day that there was no evidence against writers and artistes. Mamata Banerjee had yesterday warned that Bengal would burn if the writers and artistes, whom she refers to as intellectuals, were touched.        
	The police have also detained two members of an organisation called Bandi Mukti Committee from College Street.

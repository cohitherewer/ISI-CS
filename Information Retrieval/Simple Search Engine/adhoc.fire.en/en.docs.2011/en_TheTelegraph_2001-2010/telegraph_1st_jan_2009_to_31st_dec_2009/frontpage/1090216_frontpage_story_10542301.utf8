The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | City to suffer today in Mamata-Citu rally race 
                                                                                                           City to suffer today in Mamata-Citu rally race 
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 15: The Trinamul Congress and CPM labour wing Citu will compete to illegally occupy a strip of land in the heart of the city tomorrow, raising the spectre of a harrowing day for commuters.        
	Each has told police it would hold a rally at the Metro Channel  a narrow stretch outside the Esplanade Metro station entrance opposite Metro cinema  where political meetings are illegal.        
	The police, trying to broker peace between the rally lawbreakers rather than enforce the law, have wangled an assurance from Mamata Banerjee not to use high-decibel microphones till Citus meeting ends.        
	Mamata apparently has no problem in extending the courtesy to arch-rival Citu, the magnanimity presumably stemming from her desire to uphold democratic traditions, never mind the hapless commuters who cannot expect such a helping hand from either their elected representatives or the police.        
	Making matters worse, SUCI affiliate Medical Service Centre will be holding its own protest on Rani Rashmoni Avenue  another illegal venue  barely 400 metres away.        
	Till tonight, neither Citu nor Trinamul was ready to back down in the venue stand-off. Mamata said democratic norms demand that the Oppositions programmes get priority.        
	Both sides may eventually get to hold rallies and emerge winners but the Calcuttan will be the loser. Even one rally at the spot, right by the arterial J.L. Nehru Road, is sure to strangle traffic in the north and south of the city.        
	Citu state secretary Kali Ghosh provided an explanation for the venue clash: political groups options had narrowed after the high court banned rallies at Esplanade East, and taking army permission to use the Shahid Minar ground was too much hassle.         
	The areas around Shahid Minar and the Gandhi statue off Mayo Road are the only places where the law allows rallies, a senior police officer said. But we can do little  all parties hold rallies illegally at the Metro Channel and R.R. Avenue. The police now deploy personnel to maintain order at these rallies.         
	The Trinamul programme is expected to start around 11am. The Citu rally will begin around 12.30pm and could continue till at least 3.30pm.         
	Citu had wanted R.R. Avenue for its meeting but was told it was already taken (by the SUCI body). So Ghosh wrote to Lalbazar on January 30 booking the Metro Channel.        
	Ghosh said he had the polices verbal permission and insisted it was police practice to allow protests on first-come-first serve basis.         
	We applied for police permission 10 days ago but learnt that Citu had applied earlier. Those in government should allow us to hold the rally, Mamata said. What does the CPM want? Should we sit idle and have lozenges?        
	Her rally will protest the way the CPM managed bail for the alleged killers of Singur land protester Tapasi Malik.

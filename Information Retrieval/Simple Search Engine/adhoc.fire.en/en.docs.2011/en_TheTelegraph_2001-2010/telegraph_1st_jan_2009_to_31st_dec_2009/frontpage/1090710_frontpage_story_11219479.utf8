 															      TELEGRAPH SPORT SPECIAL                         Gavaskar				                                 
	For a newly self-confident India hungry to succeed on the world stage, there can be few better icons. But Sunil Gavaskar has one advice that can stand youngsters in good stead: there are other things in life as valuable as success.        
	The master batsman, who turns 60 on Friday, describes in an interview with The Telegraph how he received his lesson after comparative failures, by his standards, in Australia and New Zealand in 1980-81. He was then 31 but had already scored 23 Test tons and nearly 6,000 runs.        
	Id been dreading to return home (from tour), thinking that my friends had been friends only because I was the India captain and a successful batsman. I feared that they probably wouldnt be there to receive me and I worried over how they would treat me, he said.        
	As it happened, the whole lot turned up at my house on the evening of my return. There was not a word of cricket and, for me, that evening was an absolute high. My fear, clearly, had been totally misplaced and that experience changed my attitude to cricket.        
	What did it teach him?        
	(It) told me that, irrespective of whether I was successful or not, my friends would remain my friends. My scoring or not scoring would definitely matter to them, but wouldnt affect their friendship with me. Till then, Id imposed so many restrictions on myself as a batsman... I went for risk-free batting, giving myself more of an opportunity to score (big). That evening released the pressure and, in the six years that followed, I enjoyed batting. I played a lot more shots, not because I didnt care, but because of the change in attitude.        
	But perhaps he had always lacked the arrogance to think that success was everything. Because in one respect, his attitude had never changed from the time he watched his first Test as a nine-year-old and saw Garfield Sobers smash bowlers around.        
	Gavaskar said he had total and blind admiration for the West Indian great. Even today, if he comes in front of me, Im awe-struck. Despite having played with and against him, I cannot bring myself to call him Garry. I address him as Sir Garfield. For me, hes the greatest.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            The Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeobotany                                  
	New Delhi, July 11: Gardening, decoration and cultural programmes are burdening scientists at Indias apex science laboratory tasked with unravelling the origins and evolution of the worlds plants, a government audit has revealed.         
	At the Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeobotany, Lucknow, the number of researchers saddled with non-scientific and administrative tasks has steadily increased, while the institutes output of research publications has been very low, the audit has found.         
	The comptroller and auditor-general has observed that most of the scientists were engaged as convenors or members of a variety of administrative committees from 2002-03 through 2007-08. In 2006, 47 of the institutes 59 scientists (80 per cent) were involved in one or more committees to oversee accommodation, catering, cultural programmes, decoration, garden upkeep, transport and security.         
	The CAG has described the diversion of researchers for these activities as wastage of scientific manpower.         
	The audit also found that the average contribution of research papers in high quality peer-reviewed scientific journals by each scientist at the institute was just 0.43 papers (less than one paper) a year.         
	One scientist did not contribute any paper from 2002-03 to 2007-08. At least 20 scientists did not produce any papers in intervening years. And seven scientists had a single paper in high-quality journals during the six-year period.         
	The auditors have said the Birbal Sahni institutes publication rate has remained low even though its Research Advisory Council had pointed this out and asked the institution to focus more on research papers in August 2005 and again in August 2007.         
	But the scientists are unhappy with the audit notings.         
	This is the only institution in the world devoted exclusively to the study of ancient plant fossils, said Ashwini Srivastava, who has been studying plant fossils in the coal fields of Madhya Pradesh. It is a fascinating science, but it has limited scope for publication in high-impact journals, Srivastava said.         
	In response to the CAG observations, the institute has said that its research papers are regularly published in renowned journals and that journals that accept papers on palaeobotany had relatively low impact factors  in other words, they are cited less frequently than other journals. The institute has also said that the administrative committees are temporary, and set up to organise important functions.         
	The audit revealed that three projects involving the study of ancient plant remains from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Rajasthan, and Jharkhand were shut down midway, and a project to reconstruct the floral history and ancient plant migrations in Gujarat and Rajasthan failed to achieve its objectives.

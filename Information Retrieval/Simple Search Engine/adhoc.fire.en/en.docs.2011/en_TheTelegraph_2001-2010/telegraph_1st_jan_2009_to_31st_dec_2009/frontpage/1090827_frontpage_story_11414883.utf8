  - Fake Rs 1000 notes force finance ministry to take fresh look at polymer option         JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                                                    
	New Delhi, Aug. 26: The Centre is considering a pilot project to introduce polymer currency notes, worried at the expertly counterfeited Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes being pushed into the country.        
	The RBI and the finance ministrys coins and currency division had been mulling over polymer notes, developed in Australia and said to be very difficult to counterfeit, for some time now but been unable to take a decision.        
	Now the government has been jolted by realisation that Indias 2005-06 series of Rs 1000 notes, thought to be virtually impossible to fake, has been duplicated. Officials said some 4 per cent of all Rs 1000 notes in the country were fake.        
	The Reserve Bank has written to public-sector and private-sector banks that Mumbai police recently seized fake Rs 1000 notes in the series 2 AQ and 8 AC bearing governor Y.V. Reddys signatures.        
	This is the first time that (counterfeiting of) notes with new, strengthened security features like optically variable ink, colour shift, security thread, etc, has been brought to our notice, the letter says. The counterfeiting... is very much akin to genuine notes.        
	Polymer notes are more durable too, being made of non-porous polymer with a protective coating that prevents absorption of moisture.        
	A report prepared by a joint venture floated by the Australian Reserve Bank, which owns the technology for polymer notes, says the ability to create transparent areas (or clear and complete windows) is a prime security feature that makes counterfeiting difficult.        
	These windows are visible in a range of lighting conditions while another optical feature changes colour when tilted under a light source. Polymer notes also allow embossing and shadow images like paper notes.        
	Polymer notes are used in about 20 countries, including Australia, New Zealand, Romania, Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Mexico, Singapore and Sri Lanka. The central banks of these countries have put out studies claiming the use of polymer notes has drastically reduced counterfeiting.        
	None of the bigger nations, however, has adopted polymer notes  one reason India has been hesitant about the technology. Some analysts say that whatever material is used to print currency  polymer, paper, or paper mixed with other material  it is the security features that prevent counterfeiting.        
	Indian security agencies believe the fake notes are being pushed in across three borders  from Pakistan through Gujarat and Rajasthan, from Nepal, and from Sri Lanka through organised boat gangs. New Delhi raised the issue with the Nepal Prime Minister during his recent visit.        
	The other security concerns raised were that Nepals soil was being used for terrorist and other anti-India activities.        
	Fake notes used to be pushed in from Bangladesh too, officials said, but this has stopped after the Awami League came to power and cracked down on organised crime and jehadi groups.        
	The security agencies believe the notes are printed in Pakistan, possibly by its intelligence agency ISI, on high-quality, imported security paper.

	Washington, May 4: As Taliban forces edged to within 96km of Islamabad late last month, the Obama administration urgently asked for new intelligence assessments of whether Pakistans government would survive.         
	In briefings last week, senior officials said, President Obama and his National Security Council were told that neither a Taliban takeover nor a military coup was imminent and that the Pakistani nuclear arsenal was safe.         
	Beyond the immediate future, however, the intelligence was far from reassuring. Security was deteriorating rapidly, particularly in the mountains along the Afghan border that harbour al Qaida and the Taliban, intelligence chiefs reported. There were also signs that those groups were working with indigenous extremists in Pakistans populous Punjabi heartland.         
	The Islamabad government was mired in political bickering. The army, still fixated on its historical adversary India, remained ill-equipped and unwilling to throw its full weight into the counter-insurgency fight.         
	But despite the threat the intelligence conveyed, Obama has only limited options for dealing with it. Anti-American feeling in Pakistan is high, and a US combat presence is prohibited. The United States is fighting Pakistan-based extremists by proxy, through an army over which it has little control, in alliance with a government in which it has little confidence.         
	The tools most readily at hand are money, weapons and a mentoring relationship with Pakistans government and military that alternates between earnest advice and anxious criticism. As criticism has dominated in recent weeks  along with reports that the administration is wooing Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardaris principal political opponent, former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif  the partnership has grown strained.         
	What are the Americans trying to do, micromanage our politics? a senior Pakistani official said testily. This is not South Vietnam.         
	As Zardari arrives this week for his first official visit with Obama  part of a tripartite summit with Afghan President Hamid Karzai  the administration has asked Congress to quickly approve hundreds of millions of dollars in emergency military aid for Pakistan. That money, and billions more over the next several years, is to come with new authority for the defence department to decide what to spend it on.         
	Obama has also backed a five-year $7.5 billion economic assistance package and is resisting congressional efforts to impose strict conditions on any aid to Pakistan. Last month, the administration orchestrated an international donors conference in Tokyo that netted $5.5 billion in pledges for Pakistan.         
	When he sits down with Zardari on Wednesday at the White House, Obama will urge him to put more effort into building domestic support by meeting critical public needs and to resolve his differences with Sharif and others so that he can concentrate on governing, according to officials who discussed sensitive and fluid Pakistan issues on the condition of anonymity.

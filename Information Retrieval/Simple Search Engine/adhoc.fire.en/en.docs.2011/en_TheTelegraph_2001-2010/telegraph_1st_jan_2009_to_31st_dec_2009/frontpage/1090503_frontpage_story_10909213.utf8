The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Sweet offer stops Rahul 
                                                                                                           Sweet offer stops Rahul 
  - A mouthful of chumchum          ALAMGIR HOSSAIN                        Arun Das, the owner of the sweet shop; (below) Rahul at a rally in Behrampore. (Susmita Sinha De) 				                                             
	Behrampore, May 2: Arun Das, 30, peered through the window of Rahul Gandhis car and popped his impromptu question, but at first the young Congress leader didnt seem to understand.        
	Perhaps it was the broken Hindi or perhaps Arun was just too excited.        
	But the encounter had a sweet ending  Rahul left Bengal this afternoon after having his fill of chhanar baras and raser chumchums from Aruns shop, Manjushree Sweets near Textile College here.        
	The days adventure had begun for Arun around 2.45pm when, standing outside his shop, he caught sight of Rahuls blue-and-white SUV as it headed slowly in the direction of the helipad at Barrack Square. The sweet seller, along with employees Hemanta Ghosh and Sudipto Ghosh, stepped forward, arms outstretched.        
	Rahul shook hands with all three. Then Arun mustered all his courage and asked: Will you please step into my shop and have some sweets?        
	No answer. Was that a frown on Rahuls face?        
	Fellow passenger Adhir Chowdhury, Congress candidate from Behrampore constituency, came to the rescue. He turned to foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee, who was in the same car, and said: Pranabda, this shop makes very good sweets. Why dont we have some?        
	Adhir then turned towards Rahul and asked the same question. Rahul readily agreed.        
	As the Special Protection Group (SPG) guards looked on in consternation, Rahul opened the cars door and climbed out.        
	Rahul, Pranab, Adhir and K. Keshava Rao, the Congress observer for Bengal, walked into the shop and sat down around a white sun-mica-topped table. Amazed customers gazed at them from nearby tables.        
	Within seconds, stainless steel plates and stainless steel glasses had been placed before the VIP guests.        
	Rahul would have been hungry  he had just finished his second rally of the day in Bengal, the first at Domkol 40km away in favour of the Congresss Murshidabad candidate, Mannan Hossain.        
	I was thrilled to bits to see Rahul Gandhi accept Arundas offer, shop employee Hemanta said.        
	We served them our most popular sweets, chhanar bara (a local speciality) and raser chumchum. Rahul had two chhanar baras and three raser chumchums.        
	Each of the sweets cost Rs 3 but when Adhir offered to pay, Arun wouldnt even hear of it.        
	All the while Rahul chatted with the other customers and the staff.        
	He asked me how far I had studied and where I lived, Sudipto said. I told him everything about myself. I also told him what a privilege it was for us to have him in our shop. I was so overwhelmed that I ended up doing a pranaam by touching his feet.        
	Shobhana Das, wife of a retired air force employee who lives behind the shop, had come to buy doi.        
	I was astonished to see Rahul Gandhi enter the shop, Shobhana said. I was even more surprised when he asked me to sit beside him and began talking to me.        
	Shobhana told Rahul she had lived in Delhi for many years -- her husband had been posted there. I told him I had seen his mother as well as his grandmother, Indira Gandhi. He seemed pretty pleased to hear that and smiled.        
	After about 15 minutes, the Congress leaders left for the helipad.        
	Arun perhaps didnt know it, but his hospitality couldnt be more apt  his hometown owed Rahul a debt today.        
	The Congress leader had helped a freelance journalist when, in the crush at the Behrampore rally venue, he fell to the ground and hurt himself.        
	Everyone was trying to shake Rahul Gandhis hands near the barricade, Aurobinda Sarkar, the journalist, said.        
	People kept pressing against one another, and I fell. But Rahul Gandhi helped me up and told the SPG people to get me medical help. Since my injuries were minor, I said I did not need any and thanked him.

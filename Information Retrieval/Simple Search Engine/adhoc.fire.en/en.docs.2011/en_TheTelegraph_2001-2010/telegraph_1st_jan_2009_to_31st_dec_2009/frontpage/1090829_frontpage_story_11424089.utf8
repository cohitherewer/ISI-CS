          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Shillong, Aug. 28: The Meghalaya government today ordered an administrative inquiry into the death of a nurse of typhoid after she was administered Tamiflu, a medicine for swine flu at Shillong Civil Hospital.         
	We have ordered an administrative inquiry to be carried out by the directorate of health services to examine all the aspects related to the death of the nurse, deputy chief minister in charge, health, Mukul Sangma, said today.         
	According to the health minister, the directorate would inquire all the omissions and commissions related to the case and must submit the report by September 2.         
	Mary Lyngdoh, 25, who was working at the civil hospital as a nurse, died on Wednesday morning after her health deteriorated.         
	She was initially given Tamiflu as she was looking after patients who had tested positive for swine flu besides those suspected to be affected by the pandemic at the isolation ward of the civil hospital. Thereafter, Mary was admitted to the hospital on August 18 with high fever and other symptoms of swine flu.         
	The hospital authorities had sent the throat swab samples of the nurse to a private courier company on August 19 to be dispatched to the National Institute of Communicable Diseases laboratory at Beleghata Infectious Diseases Hospital in Calcutta for testing.         
	However, the alleged negligence of the courier company led to the packet containing samples landing up in Kohima instead, a state health official said.        
	A test at the civil hospital on August 24 confirmed that Mary was suffering from typhoid. The next day, when her throat swab test result reached the hospital, it was found that she had tested negative for swine flu.         
	The nurse died the next day after she was shifted from the isolation ward to the ICU of the hospital.         
	The director of health services, Dr K.H. Lakiang, today said all the lapses, including the one committed by the courier company, would be examined by the inquiry.         
	In a statement issued here, the prominent Civil Society Womens Organisation said the relatives of the nurse should get compensation from the courier company, which should also be sued for negligence.         
	The president of womens organisations, Agnes Kharshiing, said the courier company should have taken its job seriously as the packet was distinctly labelled meant for human testing.
